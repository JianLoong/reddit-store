I just sort of assume they know. Until very recently I\u2019ve only dated girls. I guess other important context is that me and my sister are not the closest in the world. We don\u2019t dislike each other, we\u2019ve just never been the type to hang out, but get on fine when we do see each other. \n\nSo, recently my (25M) sister (28F) got married and when they sent out the wedding invites I was given a plus one. I was single at the time, so asked my sister if they\u2019d want to be asked about who I decide to bring or anything like that, but she said it should be fine, and that she wasn\u2019t worried about it. \n\nA couple of weeks before the wedding I went camping with one of my oldest friends and while we were there we had some discussions and to cut a long story short we came back boyfriends. I didn\u2019t tell my sister about this because we\u2019ve never been the type to tell each other about our dating lives. Obviously I decided to take him as my plus one, and again didn\u2019t check with my sister about this because she\u2019d already given me carte blanche. \n\nThe wedding was lovely but me arriving with my bf caused more of a stir amongst our extended family than I anticipated. Not out of homophobia or anything, just gossip I think. I guess knowing I\u2019m bi is different than actually seeing me with a guy. I kinda found it funny at the time, but now after getting back from her honeymoon, my sister let me know that she\u2019s mad about it, and that it pulled focus from her and disrupted the day. I pointed out that she\u2019d said I could bring whoever, but she said she did that because she thought she could trust my judgement. I\u2019m kind of annoyed because I really don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. I\u2019d understand if I came out on the day or something but I was already out! It was just gossip, and why should I have to not bring my boyfriend anyway.

I\u2019d understand if I came out on the day or something but I was already out! \n\nYou just said that your extended family is generally not aware that you're bi, even if you're not hiding it from them. So while you aware considered out because you're not going out of your way to hide the fact, (more than) technically, you were not out to a lot of the guests. So, in their point of view, this is your coming out (even if you had your coming out years ago and the coming out is about the person and not about the people who learn the news).\n\nIt was easy to predict it would cause a commotion, even without phobia, and pull some attention from the bride and groom. \n\nSo you were not wrong for not bringing  your boyfriend to the wedding (the question in the title and in the post), but that's not what you did wrong. What you did wrong is that you didn't tell your sister first. \"I know that I usually bring girls around and most of the uncles and aunties don't know I also date boys, but now my significant other is a man. I just wanted you to know.\" would have been an easy thing to tell your sister before the wedding.\n\nYTA (not for bringing the boyf, that's really not the point even if you think it is)", "Info \u2014 what kind of stir did it create that your sister noticed?", "Gonna go against the grain with a YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a very bold move to take a person you\u2019ve only started seeing two weeks ago to a wedding of a close family member. First off you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re going to stay together because it\u2019s far too early, so if you break up, now all the photos of this person will be immortalised in your sisters wedding photos. \n\nEven if she has given you carte blanche, you should still use your best judgment of the bigger picture and act appropriately. The right thing to do would be at least to give her a heads up that you were bringing someone rather than having a perfect stranger show up at her wedding. \n\nImagine if you were getting married, and the day is supposed to be all about you, and a family member shows up with someone you don\u2019t know and causes a stir, how would that make you feel?", "YTA\n\nYou assumed your extended family knew. You know what they say about assumptions. \nYou unintentionally came out the closet at your sister's wedding. Causing a stir that took away attention from the people getting married. \nYour sister deserves an apology", "I think this is a bit of a NAH. \n\nYou're absolutely right in that your sister gave you carte blanche over who attended with you, but I think you were a little naive in the sense that you didn't consider that this would have a bit of a stir considering you haven't really told your extended family. \n\nHer wedding likely wasn't the absolute best time to hard launch the boyfriend but what's done is done. \n\nYou're not accountable for other people's gossip mill but I can understand why she'd be a little annoyed.", "NTA - What in the living fuck is going on in these comments? Y\u2019all are delusional", "I want to give your family the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were just surprised that you showed up with a boyfriend that they didn\u2019t know about before the wedding, but I also think this issue would probably not have occurred had you brought a girlfriend.\n\nNTA, your sister should be annoyed at those who are gossiping, not you for your choice of a plus one. Thats not the problem here.", "NTA.\nYou cannot help what folks talk about. This isn't some brand new person in your life, this is a long time friend turned partner. You didn't come out at her wedding, despite what folks here are saying. And this is honestly a case of homophobia from EVERYONE else involved in this, other than your bf. Cause this would never have happened if you brought a woman to the wedding.", "NTA if you had brought a girl she\u2019d have no issues.", "Am I going crazy? How in any shape or form was OP an AH? If people are more interest in other people's sexualities than the couple ON THEIR wedding, then that's 100% on the guests! Sis should be expecting an apology from those guests instead from OP. \n\nWhat do people (or the sister) expect to have happened if OP *did* tell her that he was bringing his bf instead of a gf? Would she have gone to every guest directly and said \"hey y'all, my bro is bi btw, in case you forgot\"?\n\nNTA", "NTA this is why family isn't everything", "NTA\n\nI despise the standards that if you\u2019d brought along a girl there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. You clearly didn\u2019t make a fuss out of you having a boyfriend, others did by gossiping. That\u2019s on them, not you. Even if they didn\u2019t know beforehand, you did not come out (contextually as an important announcement). The YTA comments are insane and show how there\u2019s still covert homophobia - ie see my first sentence.", "YTA\n\n1. bringing a SO of only two weeks to a close family members wedding... I am sure your sister is thrilled to have your BF of two weeks in her wedding photos.\n2. you say that most of your extended family, most of the guests at the wedding, were not aware of you being bi. you essentially had a coming out reveal at your sisters wedding.", "NTA and anyone saying otherwise clearly isn\u2019t gay or thinks differently of gay people lmao. \n\nIf you brought a girl then there wouldn\u2019t have been a reaction at all, lets be real comments thats true. Its the 21st century and I assume this is a country with liberal gay laws (north america, parts of europe, etc.) if the simple act of bringing a boy took away attention its really no ones fault but the people who can\u2019t mind their own business. You didn\u2019t use this as a way to come out you brought them cause you are dating. If it was an intentional thing to come out then YWBTA but that wasn\u2019t it.", "YTA", "YTA.  Two weeks?  Two weeks.  And no, you really weren't 'out' in the way you're trying to claim to make yourself feel better.", "Yta.", "Yta.", "Maybe it's just me, my family, my friends, but I honestly can't imagine any scenario, wedding or not, where I'd be that obsessed with someone's choice of date that I'd talk about it for more than a passing second. Even if it was someone I'd always known to date one kind of person, then shows up with a different one. Maybe I'd mention it to my own date id I saw any PDA or something, like, oh... Hannah's got a girlfriend now. They're cute together! And then... I'd go ahead and hit the dance floor. I just can't wrap my head around people caring so much.", "NTA\n\nYou used your better judgement, you brought your boyfriend like any other person would.\n\nShe's the one not using her better judgement.", "NTA. As you mentioned, you obviously didn\u2019t anticipate for drama to ensue about your relationship. I understand you don\u2019t have a very close relationship with your sister, but she shouldn\u2019t have approached you about the situation, unless it was an apology. She needs to redirect her emotions towards the people who are gossiping. And your mom is also the asshole for wanting you to apologize when you did nothing wrong but try to support your sister on her wedding day.", "NTA. if your whole family was crazy homophobic and you knew bringing a boyfriend would cause a huge fight, that would be one thing. but it sounds like people were just surprised and gossipy about it and your sister was upset that peoples attention was momentarily diverted from her princess cosplay", "NTA. Your sister was fully aware you were bi. She made no communication or stipulation towards you bringing a male partner. You even made sure to ask her beforehand if she\u2019d prefer to be asked, she said no. You weren\u2019t trying to come out at her wedding as you were already out to begin with, and you clearly had no intention of stealing the spotlight. You are not responsible for the behaviors of others, nor for doing something completely normal in bringing a plus one to a wedding. \n\nHer targeting you, instead of the gossiping guests, shows a potential bias in some regard (could be homophobia/biphobia, could be sibling rivalry, could just be you\u2019re the easiest one to blame).\n\nThe excuse I keep seeing in these comments that you can\u2019t bring someone you only dated for 2 weeks is utter nonsense. Plenty of people bring new dates, or even less established relationships. This ridiculousness doesn\u2019t even apply to you given the guy you brought was an old friend prior to dating, not some stranger you hardly know.", "NTA who cares if you bring a guy or a girl.\nShe needs to grow up. 5 minutes of people not giving  her the attention", "NTA and I don\u2019t care what the other commenters say. It\u2019s 2023 and it shouldn\u2019t be cause for gossip or scorn or disapproval or whatever for two people of the same sex or gender to be together. Straight people don\u2019t have to tap-dance around whether their partner will cause a stir in the family, so you shouldn\u2019t either.", "Massive YTA for two reasons. 1) bringing someone you've been dating 2 weeks to anyone's wedding let alone a sibling's as your plus one is rude and rather cracked imo ( cracked meaning crazy or deluded) . You have no idea how long your relationship will last, no being friends before doesn't magically make your time together as a couple longer.  2) You admitted a lot of your extended family don't necessarily know. Im bi, i get coming out is difficult but if me being bi wasn't common knowledge amongst my older and extended family i wouldn't just turn up to my sisters wedding with a same sex date as thats pretty obviously going to cause a stir, create drama and draw attention away from the wedding.", "NTA, your sister and your parents are! Like honestly WTF they are only having this reaction because you brought a guy instead of a girl. Don't apologize to anyone, you didn't do shit wrong.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You have a partner and the plus one invite never clarified that it was limited to hetro. \n\nUnfortunately, our societies have this tendency to raise eyebrows when they see something unusual. They may gossip, but none of it matters and when you are proud of your identity as a bi, dont overthink it. Let people talk, they will always need something to talk. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced something like this myself, in which I went to my cousins marriage and she, along with her mom got mad with me because my wife was looking more beautiful than the bride herself. \n\nIf you are anything like me, I would not give it a second thought. If someone cannot accept and respect my choices, they are not worth thinking about. \n\nThat said, if you put your relationships over your own self, I can respect you for that. And in that case\u2026\n\nYou can apologise for your poor judgement relating to her, but only for the sake of preserving your bond with her. \n\nIf it was a different cousin\u2019s marriage in my case, one who is much closer to me, then i would have done the same. I wouldn\u2019t want to lose her if all it needed to preserve that bond was an apology.", ">asked my sister if they\u2019d want to be asked about who I decide to bring or anything like that, but she said it should be fine, and that she wasn\u2019t worried about it.\n\nNTA for this alone.", "NTA. Who cares dude? If people can\u2019t get their head out of their asses and focus what\u2019s really important, THE WEDDING. That\u2019s on them.", "NTA. She had her chance to comment on your plus one. The rumor mill wasn't your fault, it's society's continued view that LGBT relationships are abnormal. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a rumor mill. People voting YTA just know it's easier to police LGBT people in order to avoid conflict created by others. They have a higher expectation on LGBT people than people who still have homophobic feelings.", "I think the issue isn\u2019t that you brought a boyfriend, it\u2019s that no one knew you were even dating someone. As you said, 2 weeks. If I showed up to a family event with someone when no one knew I was dating, there would be gossip. \n\nI kinda think either 1) you should have come as \u201cfriends\u201d to keep the gossip to a minimum or 2) given your sister a heads up. \n\nYes 1 sounds like you\u2019re hiding that you date guys but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s more like keeping the focus off of your barely established relationship. Weddings are not when you should announce a new relationship\n\nETA: NTA for bringing him, but Y T A for taking over the conversations. It sounds like that\u2019s what is remembered the most from her wedding day.", "NTA. Just do the non-apology apology: \"Hey, I'm sorry my bringing my bf upset you.\"  (That really just means \"I regret\", but you aren't owning up to some fault on your side.) Then move on!", "NTA. \n\nBut I can also see how the first time you make an appearance with a boyfriend, it may get people talking.   You did nothing wrong here.  But at the same time, brides are weird about anything takes takes the slightest bit of attention away from them is something that angers them", "NAH. Tell her you're sorry it ruined your relationship and you hope she has a happy life.", "YTA. \nAs someone who\u2019s queer, i think you lacked self awareness in this situation. Bringing a new bf \n to a big event like your sisters wedding really took a lot of attention away from her specially since you weren\u2019t fully out to your extended family. This wasn\u2019t the time or place to introduce someone you\u2019ve been dating for two weeks, even if y\u2019all were friends before that. You could\u2019ve brought him as a \u201cfriend\u201d and introduce him as your bf to your core family on the side. You really didn\u2019t handle the situation well and you are coming off as entitled. I would apologize to your sister", "You did pull focus from her so just apologize for that and keep it moving. \n\nNAH.", "YTA", "YTA do you secretly hate your sister ? Or are you just an attention seeking human . 2 WEEKS I mean come on you knew what you were doing you wanted to stir it up and be the diva that you are . Honestly I hope your sister just cuts u off for good cause u deserve the silent treatment for a while", "YTA!!! Together for two weeks and it\u2019s your big coming out moment? What about her wedding? You made it about yourself. This is coming from a gay man.", " YTA you said it yourself that your extended family doesn\u2019t really know you are. So u decide to bring your bf of 2(!!!) weeks to the wedding. Your judgment skills are way below average", "YTA.\n\nThe wedding day is about your sister, her husband, and only them.  It sounds like you agree that bringing your boyfriend did, in fact, distract the attention from them for a period of time. So that leaves two possibilities: (1) shame in your family and what they did wasn\u2019t something you shorn have foreseen; or (2) your sister blessed the decision.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a shame on your family situation. I\u2019d they didn\u2019t know, even if they dont judge/have an issue, it is still something that is going to be noticed and commented on, and it sounds like you maybe expected some of that but not as much as happened? Regardless, it is totally foreseeable that this would have happened.\n\nSo they leaves the fact you asked your sister if she wanted to know. But I think most people would take your sister\u2019s reaction as essentially trusting you judgment. Meaning she wasn\u2019t saying \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d she was acting \u201cyou have good judgment, if you think it is good, I\u2019m sure they are fine.\u201d But it seems like maybe you didn\u2019t exercise that judgment too well. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is an intentional YTA, but you should have acted differently, I don\u2019t think there is anything your sister should have done differently, and what you did upset her, so YTA, but a YTA that was not malicious", "YTA...  one.. because you choose her wedding to pop out of the closet & two.. because why would you bring someone you have only been dating a short period of time to a family wedding.. would have been better to bring no one..", "Blame on you,while not being clear .. nah you are not TA .. kinda d..b if you ask me.. keeping it free, was asking for this to happen. Although you could have asked if was ok, just to be sure.. so learn from this, don't assume anything, verify with your situation, same counts for your sister.", "YTA this is the equivalent of proposing at a wedding without letting ANYBODY know that is your plan. It doesn't matter your reasoning of \"um my family should know haha\" This WAS your coming out.\n\nThis was not YOUR day. It wasn't your intention and it's certainly not your fault that some people were gossipy. But your sister has a right to be angry at you for causing gossip on a day that was supposed to be all about her.", "Is not the intentional asshole a thing? Really just anything that has potential to deflect from the bride, wedding or festivities afterwards is considered bad form.\n\nI don\u2019t think you did it with malice but I also don\u2019t think you thought it through either. Bringing a male date isn\u2019t the problem. Not taking into consideration that while family wouldn\u2019t have cared it refocused the energy to you.\n\nNTA for being a same sex date but AH for not considering it from the angle of you would change the focus.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s nothing like in movies where there\u2019s a big announcement and then it\u2019s all fine, it\u2019s an everyday occurrence and it\u2019s really boring honestly. \n\nI\u2019ve been openly bi for 7 years at this point - don\u2019t lie about it, dated men and women, have stuff on my social media profiles about it. But I still have to \u2018come out\u2019 regularly - either to new people, or to people that I just never realised hadn\u2019t picked up on something that\u2019s just a fact of life to me. \n\nI have No Idea which relatives know about me - whether my parents mentioned my girlfriends to grandparents and aunts, whether my cousins on social media have seen the relevant context. \n\nMy coworker, Ann,  asked me cautiously the other day if I was worried about being out at work - I honestly had no idea that the rest of the coworkers didn\u2019t know. It hasn\u2019t come up, and it\u2019s just an inherent bit of me that I didn\u2019t mention until I told Ann about an ex girlfriend. When I was at a small uni, everyone knew before they were even friends with me because it was a small, visible community - now with my friends from all over a large city I have to remember to be like \u2018oh yeah, some personal context on me!\u2019 \n\nI then never know if people will be chill or if it will be A Thing. And this is just, a bimonthly part of my life. When I was dating women, we\u2019d be \u2018coming out\u2019 and \u2018drawing attention\u2019 by just being a non-straight couple in public.\n\nI\u2019ll agree that OP should have checked, and that a gentle apology to his sister is probably the best (you didn\u2019t mean to draw attention and didn\u2019t realise it would, you were just excited to share a happy day with the person you cared about and took her words too literally. But you should have checked in). \n\nBut I would say NAH because ultimately, if people didn\u2019t spot open bi-ness and are gossiping/shocked about a couple at a wedding, that really comes down to their behaviour and heteronormativity in general.

If people react more negatively to a male partner than to a female one that's an absolutely textbook example of homophobia. Especially the comment about bad judgement.\n\nComing out, in an non-homophobic environment, is supposed to be about self-affirmation and won't cause a commotion. A wedding guest's partner may always take someone by surprise, for any number of reasons - maybe they are a different race, have a disability, are visibly a star athlete or someone well-known, or are a sex previously unanticipated, or have an unusual gender presentation, or are wearing an attire that shows they belong to a religion or other. Well-mannered guests and hosts will take it win stride.", "Also - 'assuming' that his extended family know is basically saying he assumed someone in his immediate family outted him without permission.  If I had a family member who only brought girls around and never mentioned being bi around family I certainly would never tell anyone in the family he dates boys too.", "To be fair, I also said that I assumed they knew. I guess they didn\u2019t take it seriously before actually seeing me with a guy, but Id be surprised if they actually hadn\u2019t heard anything before the wedding.", "You really think it's reasonable to expect us to explicitly tell every single person we know? And he'd already asked his sister about telling her who he was bringing and she said she didn't need that. His sister knows he is bi.", "Just people talking about it a lot. Not the whole time obviously, but I could tell people were looking at us a lot, and chatting about us and a couple of people came up to sort of clumsily say how supportive they were lol.

If not everybody knows you're gay you have to tell em all first before bringing a partner to a wedding?\n\nDumb.", "I agree, despite these comments being very torn.

Only thing I could see is if he was showing off almost.", "What consideration do you mean that OP should have taken that he didn't already? Not bring their partner to a wedding where they were explicitly given a plus one? That would have been such an asshole move against the BF.  \n\n\nIn my opinion OP should not have to worry about their families response to them bringing their partner to their sisters wedding. He wouldn't need to if it was his GF so this shouldn't be any different.

What do these people expect to have happened if OP *did* tell his sister he was bringing a man instead of a woman? If the guests were more interest in another person's sexuality than the couple ON THEIR wedding, then that's 100% on the guests. Sis should be expecting an apology from those guests instead from OP.", "You don't come out at somebody's wedding.  You don't propose at somebody's wedding.

He wasn't even dating the friend when he asked her, so how would she know to comment on it?", "What you said about brides and attention, it\u2019s really beyond me.

I appreciate people who check with me but I always give blanket permission, and it\u2019s a lot easier than doing it myself. Sometimes it\u2019s more insulting to have something that you\u2019re very open about, or your relationships, treated like it\u2019s a secret.

Im happy for people to just say it.", "You know what they say about assuming....It makes an an ass out of you and Ming.\n\nto me, it does not matter that you didn't had bad intentions or assumed stuff. The good judgement call would have been to tell your sister. Even if your date at the moment was a woman. After all, your plus-one is a guest at your sister's wedding. Weddings are a big deal to the bride and groom. Even if plus-ones are given, it's in good taste to let the bride and groom who is coming or not to the wedding. Given that you're not close to your sister, even more reason to treat the whole thing like you would with someone you're not close with. \"Hey! Excited to be part of your wedding in 2 weeks!

However, if you went table to table introducing your bf & trying to create a stir because you \u201cfound it funny\u201d then that\u2019s an entirely separate issue.\n\nRegardless, there\u2019s no harm in acknowledging your sister\u2019s feelings & apologizing.

And when he was single, he did ask her if she cared at all who he might bring, and she said no. I've seen people bring friends as +1s.

How it exists in double standards", "yeah and if you'd brought him to the wedding as your friend it would have been whatever.\n\nbut you brought him as your SO. so the wedding served as the extended family learning- oh, OP is bi-. so that probably became a major topic instead of the wedding.\n\nyou may have not intended it but it was a foreseeable result.", "So you bring him to your sister wedding to present him as your bf? \n\nYTA for not telling her beforehand, a little heads up before making her wedding about you \"coming out\" and publicly presenting your 2 weeks bf would have been nice.", "But did you ever update your sister about actually bringing someone? If I have you down as one person and two show up there\u2019s a problem.", "He didn't come out - he just came with a partner. If people make a commotion about it that's on them. And even if it's \"positive\" it's still homophobic - though I got more of a gossip vibe, which isn't even positive.

You. Don't. Know. I am sorry you have dealt with so much hate in your life that you automatically assume others are dealing/dealt with the same.\n\nIt still caused a stir that the bride didn't appreciate, even though it wasn't intentional and ideally shouldn't have happened.", "It\u2019s not about being bigoted or backwards lmao, whether you want to address it or not being bi or gay or anything but straight is something that people will talk about and will distract from the couple getting married.", ">In my eyes, this is the equivalent of someone showing up pregnant to a wedding without letting the bride/groom know prior.
