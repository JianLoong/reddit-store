Almost everyone in our friend group has taken a trip recently, but none as nice as Molly. She goes on pretty lavish vacations to foreign countries that none of us can afford.\n\nAnyway, when Molly got back from trip #1 a couple weeks ago, she sat us down to show us photos\u2026 it ended up being a 45 minute slideshow of all the videos/photos/meals/places Molly went. It was cool, but I felt like it should\u2019ve been 20 minutes max.\n\nI made a comment to the other friends that they should share their trip photos too- trying to make them feel included. Nobody wanted to share, which was fine (tbh we were so tired of looking at photos at this point).\n\nOk so Molly goes on trip #2 to Paris at the same time I\u2019m on my vacation. I had hoped to spend 5 or so minutes showing our friends the highlights of my trip when we all hung out the other night. But, Molly spent the ENTIRE night talking about her Paris trip. Toward the end of the night, Molly pulls up her slideshow again on the TV and takes an HOUR to show us all of the photos. We hit the hour mark and I say \u201chey I think I need to go to bed, it\u2019s getting late\u2026\u201d (it was nearing 10pm). Molly says \u201cno, wait I need to show you a few more.\u201d \n\nNicely, I reply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry - I can\u2019t- you\u2019ve had an entire hour. That\u2019s more than enough time to devote to this and I don\u2019t feel like watching anymore when I\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d And I left.\n\nI could tell that Molly was NOT happy. \nI do feel bad for leaving but also\u2026 I didn\u2019t get to share any of my pics, and she never gave me the chance to talk about my trip once in the 3-4 hours we hung out. So, I feel like I\u2019m not TA? Also, I feel like it\u2019s rude to not be considerate of people\u2019s time.

No one cares about your vacation photos", "ESH- if you never told her how you felt after her first trip, how was she supposed to know that you don\u2019t want to see photos from the second trip for that long of a time again? \n\nAlso your jealousy comes through like crazy. The info of how much she spent and that you couldn\u2019t afford it yourself sucks, but it doesn\u2019t make her a villain and it\u2019s clear you resent her for that. It\u2019s really not relevant to this but because you\u2019re jealous and looking for validation and sympathy here, you include these details. You wanted to show your photos too so don\u2019t pretend that she\u2019s bragging when essentially you want to do the same and share your photos. I\u2019ve never understood people that come back and want to everyone to see their photos anyway. But because her trip was \u201clavish\u201d it\u2019s wrong for her to take up a lot of time when no one\u2019s stopping her until an HOUR passes. I\u2019m curious if one of your friends that didn\u2019t take a \u201clavish\u201d trip showed their photos for an hour, if you\u2019d feel the same\u2026\n\nJust because she chooses to spend her money that way and you couldn\u2019t afford to, doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. If you don\u2019t want to see her photos after more than 5 min, tell her nicely. You can\u2019t expect her to read your mind. Did you even speak up that you had photos you wanted to share too? Or did you just let her go on and on and take up all of the time to make yourself more of a victim? Yes an hour is being ridiculous, but so is not saying anything and then complaining when you let it happen not once but twice. \n\nWhat DOES make her an asshole is when you express disinterest after letting it go on for an hour and want to go to bed, she insists you stay. She seems to like bragging and I get that it\u2019s annoying but also you let her\u2026. Everyone sucks here. \n\nJust a life pro tip, no one cares at all about your own vacation photos except you. In the future you should all get a 5 min timer to show your photos but also just understand literally no one cares.
