After years of trying to prevent it, our cat was put down today. It was the classic story you've all heard. Dad didn't want a pet, and finally allowed it, and they became best friends. My wife on the other hand, was jealous that I became \"her person.\"\n\nAccording to an allergy doc, kittens are hypoallergenic. Once they mature, people begin to show signs of allergies. My wife is allergic to cats. She toughed it out as best she could. Allergy meds helped, but she still avoided the cat like the plague. It broke my heart seeing her unable to enjoy the cat she so badly wanted. But the aversion turned into hatred. The stupid cat was the root of her problems, and she'd remove her from the bed if she ever came onto it, or get her off her lap if she came to sit on it. Then the mother bear came out. She wasn't allowed around our kids room because they might be allergic too (no signs were ever shown). I feel my cat noticed this hostility, and she started to rebel. She'd occasionally pee outside the litter box. Dont get me wrong, this pissed me off too, but my wife moreso. She'd threaten to get rid of the cat since she was misbehaving.\n\nI tried everything I could to fix the problem. New cat litter. Daily changes. Bigger litterboxes. More litter boxes. Anti anxiety meds. Calming wall plug ins. Everything you could think of to get this cat to use the box. It'd work for a time, and then she'd rebel, and pee on a carpet. She finally hit her last straw. She was leaving. No shelters wanted her given her behavior. Nobody would adopt her online. A vet recommended she be put to sleep.\n\nI've been a mess. I've held myself together at work, and I'd come home to spend my final few nights with my cat. I'd cry. My wife would hold me, but later I'd hear her mutter that she couldn't wait for the cat to be gone. \n\nShe crossed the rainbow bridge while I was at work today. I feel like we failed her, and didn't give her a full life. \n\nMy wife asked if I would morn her death like this, and reminded me that I didn't cry much after my grandma's two year battle with dementia ended. I still did, but I also know she was suffering for so long, and death was the end of her pain. I tried to counter with not shedding a tear when my childhood dog was put down. He was 17, had arthritis, was mostly blind, deaf, and lost bowel control. It was his time. Death in those cases was an end to their misery. It was almost mercy.\n\nI equate this loss to something like a car crash. I feel a life was cut too short. I got days to say goodbye when I wanted years. Now I've got a gaping hole in my heart where my cat used to be, and a wife who says she feels like I hate her for doing what she did. I can see her point of view, and tell her I see it. I just wish I could have time to mourn the cat I loved, flaws and all, without being reminded of the trouble she caused, or hear people secretly celebrate her passing.\n\nAITA for being so devastated by this?", "created_utc": 1694840995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jywkd/aitawife_isnt_upset_about_a_pet_death_and_is_mad/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Holy crap. And no, I'm uninterested in your excuses. Even kicking the cat to the curb would have been better. Your wife is insane. Like, certifiably insane. You should have left her long before, should have left her when she killed your cat, and should leave her now.\n\nBut, here's some good news. Your cat is alive. Your wife probably abandoned it at a pet shelter or dumped them on the side of the road. I'd call around at local per shelters to see if a cat by your cats description was dropped off. The fact she didn't show you the email, and how you didn't do the bare minimum of confirmation the appointment and the medical necessity, and this being done when you were at work tells me the cat is still alive.

It's normal to grieve for an animal. I lost my dog to cancer a year ago and I miss her everyday. I was going to say YTA for letting her put down your cat, but it seems you were against it until the very end and she did it behind your back, so I'll just say this: Do you really want to be with this woman? I know Reddit looks down on this sort of thing, and for good reason, but seriously? She kills a healthy animal because she was annoyed with it and is annoyed at you because you are grieving the loss of an animal that didn't have to die. Did it behind your back. She caused you emotional pain and doesn't care. She callously ends a life that didn't need to be ended. She killed an animal that she wanted. I know some people would say it's just an animal, but that animal had a life, and you clearly cared about it. You have kids, so of course a divorce would devistate them, so obviously you can't do something so rash. But think about it.

I would look her in the eyes and tell her I will grieve for her about as much as she has for the cat. \nShe is responsible for the cats bad behavior. Anyone who has ever owned a cat know how emotional they can be. Who is she to decide and carry out the \"execution\" as you so politely put it and what kind of weak minded person just goes off to work KNOWING that's her plan? \"Nothing you can do about it?\" Oh.. there was lots of things you could do about it.

But it seems like your wife felt like she had no choice, because you clearly were placing the cat\u2019s happiness over your wife\u2019s.  And in your wife\u2019s mind, if you couldn\u2019t find someone to adopt the cat and you couldn\u2019t find a shelter to take the cat (still find that odd), WTF was she supposed to do?  It\u2019s not the cat\u2019s house - it\u2019s HERS, at least partly.\n\nHumans are more important than animals.  I know Reddit has a problem with that statement.

And only a freaking sociopath would think they are.\n\nAgain, humans are more important than animals.  Your cat was making life intolerable for your wife.  And you were just letting it happen.  She killed your cat because she couldn\u2019t deal with constant allergies and constant cat pee.  You should have gotten that cat a new home way, WAY earlier.

I love cats, but I hate cat piss more.  If I had a cat pissing in my house, that cat would no longer be in my house.  I empathize with both sides.  It's fine to mourn.  Everyone is different about that.  Your wife isn't a monster, and there's no shame in showing emotion for a loved one.  All that said, and reddit points be damned, the world is not running out of cats.  Thousands of cats are put to sleep every week, if not every day, because we have cats coming out our ears.  You can get another cat after the divorce, because that's where this is headed if the two of you can't find middle ground on this.  It won't be tomorrow, or next month, but this kind of shit is slow poison on a marriage.

Kids die in a car crash? I've been in therapy there... \n\nI think to me death is fine if they've lived a full life, and were suffering. It's still sad, but it's part of life.

My appeals were exhausted.

It honestly baffled me that they seemed so ok with it.", "I mean , she's probably just not gonna allow the kids to get a pet lol. I wanted a pet when I was little and my parents just never let me cause they didn't like them so now I don't really care for animals that much and Def don't want one ,this is a recurring thing with parents like her (or not even that far as her cause just killing the cat is insane)", "I can see her side of the argument. I dont agree with it. Yes, seeing her struggle with allergies wasn't fun, and I didn't want her to live the rest of her life suffering, but also, I feel putting her down for peeing on rugs was extreme. I would have much rather rehomed her, but she wasn't willing to put up with her peeing on the rug more.

My guess (in the unlikely event this is real) is OP is massively underselling how bad the situation was. Wouldn't be surprised if it was something like urinary tract problems where they were out of treatment options and wife hears \"No other options, this will only get worse\" and decides the pain, expense and health concerns for their young children make it the right choice, and Bozo the Clown here decides it's not fair because he loves the cat and he'll find the solution.\n\n(Also, re: the allergies. I think they got a kitten not realising the wife was allergic to cats, but by the time adult coat kicked in he was attached/she was mostly able to manage with medication and strict policies about cuddling)", "It's absolutely insane.

Why not, she sure did! This is so out of this world heartless I can't even begin to tell you. Google DARVO, please.\n\nI know, I know, we tend to diagnose people here without much to go on, but I would very, very seriously research narcissism (not traits, the actual disorder) at this point.\n\nThere is no way she's an absolute angel otherwise and always respects other people and their feelings, but callously killed a cat just for loving you and not her, then blames you for feeling sad about it.\n\n**Edit**: another commenter is likely right that this woman didn't contact a vet, she likely just tossed the cat out on the streets and said that to prevent OP from finding the cat.

If this is real, then either the vet's a quack/was fed false information/or is just as big of a monster as your wife. \n\nI'm not really buying this due to knowing far worse cats with far worse issues being adopted by people the moment euthanasia is mentioned.

This is a disgusting disregard for life!!! If your child was misbehaving would you just give up and do the same? You willingly took on the responsibility of living and caring for this cat, and both you and your wife did neither (and yes it is on both of you because you are not a child, you could have stood your ground and did the right thing). The problem was most likely caused by stress from the poor cat living in a home where it was hated and unwanted. Animals are very in tune with emotions and are affected greatly by such hostility and anger. Imagine a toddler in a home where he wasn\u2019t wanted and ignored and yelled at and unloved. Can you see now how this would lead to extreme behavioral issues? And don\u2019t try and say the only option was to kill the cat, we all know this isn\u2019t true. When you adopt a cat you agree and sign that you will return the animal to the organization if you can ever for any reason no longer care for it. I would have seen my wife\u2019s true colors and left her before I would have went along with this and let the cat be killed. And your vet is a massive AH for going along with this, too!!! You will live with this on your conscience for eternity as you deserve to.

I hope you rot. You're absolutely TA in every way, possible", "I could never forgive someone doing that.", "Did you go with to every vet visit? Cause I feel like the vet might not have known the whole truth here. Is it possible she exaggerated the cats ailments in order to get them to agree to kill the cat? I don\u2019t know man, if my wife did that knowing full well I loved the cat, I\u2019d consider a divorce. I\u2019d be different if you weren\u2019t putting in effort to rehome it, but you were and she still went out and had it euthanized.
