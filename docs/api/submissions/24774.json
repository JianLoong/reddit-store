Whether the walls were bare white or not would have no effect on how I feel living there.\n\nI'm not trying to come for you I just don't understand the point you're making. As a counter example my entertainment is important to me. I really appreciate having nice speaker systems and a modern TV that can get me high resolutions. My girl just needs the TV to work. I'm not gonna get on her about saving up her cash so we can splurge on a brand new 4K ultra HD TV for the apartment because she doesn't care about that sorta thing and if I want it, it's on me.", "I thought this as well, sounds like a passive aggressive attempt to address another issue", "You spend all your time bullying people on reddit. You're not better.", "To some extent, I don\u2019t disagree with you. A TV is a huge luxury item that a partner might not want or benefit from. However, there are many home items that both partners should benefit from, but it becomes the woman\u2019s responsibility to purchase. Items like a vacuum cleaner, an area rug, or throw blankets, or curtains, or new dishes if your set is all cracked. Do you need those items? Not necessarily. Do they make living in the home more comfortable, and a better place for guests? It\u2019s still considered a woman\u2019s job to make a house a home, and now that we work, we often hold the burden of paying for these items. Do we need them? No. But most grown adults don\u2019t actually want to live in a barren apartment with a giant tv and a few sets of shelves to hold their items.", "real quick, did i ever claim i was?", "Did I ever claim that you claimed you did?", "No YNTA, at the end of the day it is your money and you choose how you wish to spend it, just as she does with hers.

Your girlfriend is policing your money.  It's YOUR money & it's not up to her how you spend it.

The fact of the matter is that he's traded in one of his items (video games) to get himself another item (other video games) \n\nIf someone had come on here saying \"my SO traded in their video games and used the money to get other games instead of decorations for our apartment\" then most people would probably agree that it's their items they are trading in, they get the money.

If she wants to discuss how much he\u2019s gaming, she needs to speak to him about that.  There\u2019s no reason not to be direct.\n\nAs she is only talking about the cost of the games and she wishes he would use all his money towards the apartment, that\u2019s what we have to go with.", "OK I'm tryna figure out what her problem is here and if money isn't an issue and you don't spend an excessive amount of time playing games, how's your sex life? Not trying to be intrusive but if you're staying up after she goes to bed on weekends maybe she wants you to go to bed with her bc she's wanting more intimacy and affection or smth, maybe you could talk to her again and ask her to clarify if her concern is about how you spend your money or how you spend your time? If it is actually about the money there could also be something deeper she wants to talk about it might not be about the games maybe she's wanting to discuss your future together and is thinking about how your purchases would affect her if your finances were shared idk I definitely think you should bring it up again and encourage her to share her emotional reasoning rather than the practical aspects, make sure she knows you don't want to argue you just want to understand where she's coming from so you can find the right solution bc she might just be struggling to express her needs", "Ig this really just falls down to what you consider a benefit. A vaccum cleaner and some curtains I can sign up for. They are practical and I can see how I benefit directly. Throw pillows, blankets and area rugs less so. Those things are really only included as desires and I don't think partners should be forced to pay for desires.\n\nAs for women making a home a home I think that's more of a saying that encapsulates the different ways men and women live. Many men are, very happy with their TV, couch and table. They don't see the need for throw pillows and are subsequently not interested in spending money on these things. Even the dishes example is great. Men will eat off the same plates for years because as long as the plate holds food it works so no need for new ones. Women very much will buy new sets of dishes to match their kitchen or their decor or because their is a crack in the plate."]}
