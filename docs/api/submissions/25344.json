Pro tip, though, pervs are going to look \\*regardless\\* of what she's wearing.  It really doesn't matter what she wears, there will people who look at her sexually, because we're humans and most of us are sexual beings to some degree.  She will look at others sexually too, and though you don't need to know the details, you need to accept (and nurture) her growth into a full human which includes this aspect.\n\nAs for \"I don't want to see that\"... It's time for you to learn to do better, and learn not to sexual body parts just because you grew up in a time when it was cool to consider something to always be sexual.  \n\nShe is not responsible for the behaviors of other people, and you need to really, REALLY get that.  \n\nHere's the bit where you need to parent (the rest is work on yourself).  You need to teach her how to make context-based decisions on clothing.  Crop top and booty shorts for grandma's funeral? No.  Crop top and booty shorts for hanging with friends and the beach? Yeah.  That's fine.  That means taking some consideration of the people around you, but not letting others dictate what you wear.\n\nIt's a fine line, and you need to teach her now how to make those decisions for herself, before she has a jealous partner try to pull what is essentially same thing you did \"I don't want anyone else looking at you like that\".", "I get where you are coming from, but it is the wrong message to send to your young daughter that she may be tempting perverts, or can somehow prevent them from committing their own bad behavior.

The shorts are short.  Rarely do I see fashionable shorts that are of \"normal\" length.  Manufacturers make girls shorts short.

Why is that not an issue when wearing a swimsuit at the beach? Are there more perverts in the shopping centre than at the beach?
