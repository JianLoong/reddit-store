We also have a daughter who is almost 2. My usband's parents, only sister and husband, and 1 niece live in another state. Since we have been married we have made numerous trips to see them, whether we meet half way or we just come to them. His parents have visited twice since we've been married. His father no longer works and his mother can work from home. Her office is actually in the state we live in as they used to live here too.\n\nIt didn't really bother me until more recently. I posted awhile back about a falling out we had with my husband's sister/HER husband. The last time we visited, we brought my youngest sister for extra hands. This BIL (husband's sister's husband) came onto MY little sister. So we left and will not be returning for awhile. We confided in his parents about what happened and they were equally as appalled but since it's happened everyone wants to pretend like it didn't. Needless to say there's certainly been some tension.\n\nDue to this they promised to come up by us for Xmas and we would alternate each year. They already bailed on that idea because MIL couldn't get anymore days off work. They offered to come for our daughter's bday in Oct instead. Well now that's not happening either due to some health concerns for both MIL and FIL, which I entirely understand and needs to take priority. \n\nThat being said, they vacation every 3/4 months to Vegas... They always can get time off for that and sometimes I wish they would take that time to come see us, which I have expressed. Our daughter's bday is beginning of Oct and they have a trip planned for end of Oct to Vegas. My husband will be joining also. When they officially canceled their trip for our daughter's bday I assumed they'd also be canceling their Vegas trip as they claim they can't take all this time off and their health concerns are keeping them from traveling here. Then my husband shared with me last night they'd be going to Vegas regardless.\n\nI was super confused and super hurt. I asked how severe their health concerns were that they could gamble, drink and smoke but they couldn't spend one weekend with their other grandchild... He said he understood my frustration but to leave it alone. \n\nWell I didn't. I texted MIL to see if their were any updates on their appts regarding their health. She said not really but they were too wiped out to come for our daughter's bday. I followed up by asking if that meant Vegas was canceled too as it was only a few short weeks after? She said she has to go because it's for work and they would see about FIL. \n\nI kindly said how hurt I'd be if they couldn't make it for their granddaughters bday but they could muster up the strength for Vegas of all places. I explained I understood the health concerns, but I don't see how such serious health issues will vanish in a matter of weeks.

I saw you commented that your hubby was ALSO upset about this, and I don't doubt you were both confused and hurt by this.\n\nHe's probably not upset with WHAT you said, exactly, because he likely agrees.  But he asked you not to say anything, and you did.  If this was your own mother that's a green light to let her rip, but honestly you will be better off in the long run by letting him deal with his parents.  If they want to disregard building a relationship that's on them.  You can't force them to prioritize her.\n\nHowever, the bill on this will come due for them down the road, when she's a stranger to them and they don't understand why.\n\nAll you two can do is be on the same page when it comes to your boundaries and navigating those relationships on both sides.  Talk about how you're feeling and have a plan for the future when your daughter is older and 'more fun' for them to be around.  As someone with a toxic MIL that I've had to navigate with extreme care (but we've found acceptable footing after more than a decade of marriage) the best thing you can do is plan ahead.  If your hubby wants to stand up to them/voice his concerns support him as best you can, but just know that the minute you start trying to take the reins you will become the next persona non grata in his family's eyes.\n\nBest of luck to you both!", "YTA. Your husband told you to leave it alone and you didn't. It's their life, their choices. If they want to go to Vegas instead of your daughter's birthday, that's on them.

Obviously things can get in the way but from what happened with SIL and the going to Vegas afterwards, the illness is clearly a superficial excuse.\n\nIf it was me I would be reluctant to allow them to make my child feel \u2018less than\u2019 especially if they begin to show favouritism with their other granddaughter. Their actions show they aren\u2019t really interested in having a closer bond so don\u2019t try to force it.", "YTA. You went behind your husbands back and complained about this to his mother.

Better to let go of this disappointed now than to let it keep eating at you.", "Soft YTA. A lot of time I do not ask my parents things because I already know the answer, and asking will be more work than just moving on.

Would it be nice for your child to see their grandparents and grow their relationship? Of course. But they clearly don't want to. Your husband should have contacted his parents. Going forward you'll just have to expect them not to want to come. If they wanted to, they would.

You're going to be much happier the sooner you stop caring if they show up or not.", "NTA. Your husband's parents are going to be the kind of grandparents that it's all on their terms and with a certain level of hypocrisy. I understand where this is coming from as my in-laws are the same way. \n\nGiven that your husband is okay with being sloughed off by his own parents you'll probably have to go with it, but it can hurt when you see a slight against your own child aka their grand-daughter.\n\nI don't agree with the other comments that you shouldn't have called as you are either a part of the family or not. Parents don't get to pick and choose if and when their DIL or SIL gets upset. I guess they do, but you are all adults and you called them on it. The MIL is a brat to whine to her son, but that's the way it falls sometimes. Family dynamics at play. Your husband is probably upset because he just wants to avoid rocking the boat. You are entitled to be hurt, but I would leave them alone at this point.\n\nThis is from my perspective of 26 years trying to do the right thing with MIL and SIL and fed up now so take my comments with a grain of salt. My decision is to stay away from them, but at the same time if they ask my opinion I'm nit sugarcoating anymore. \n\nIn some ways look at this as a blessing, as you can do the holidays your way, create your own traditions without their input. It is their loss.", "Screw her and your husband for not standing up to his asshole parents and defending his wife and child.

And ran away.\n\nSo the truth is out: Mil doesn't want to bother with OP's child, and won't say as much stai9ght out, though it may have to do with the BIL.\n\nOf course it's the in-laws' right to be non-participating grandparents, though Op says it \"hurts.\" \n\nWhere the sin lies, I think, is the husband's refusal to deal honestly with this and tell OP what's really going on.", "As someone who suffers chronic health issues, I'll tell you: sometimes we have to forgo things in order to \"charge\" for whatever upcoming obligation we have.

You caused more issues which is really going to keep them away.", "YTA- mostly for overstepping when your husband said not to. \n\nYour in-laws seem open to you visiting them, so it's probably not some personal issue against your family.

Does that automatically require them to be sick for the entire month and cancel the other trip they have planned and paid for?  Are you the sick police?  They have come to you twice in 2 years and you say that you also meet halfway or go there. That seems like quite a few visits given the distance.  More than some local families probably get together.  People have lives and aren\u2019t going to use all their time off to visit grandkids.", "NTA.  \nMIL / FIL have thier priorities off.

I want him to spend the time with his parents as he misses them all the time but I didn't mention us always coming to them could be enabling them not to come here...", "Again, just upset for my daughter and husband. They are really missing out, but thank you. I think I am personally struggling with the reality cause my family is super duper close. This is weird to me.", "This was refreshing. Thank you for your insight. I'm not one to care when it's comes to me personally. I am very \"if they wanted to they would\". But as a mother it hurts me for my husband and it hurts me for my daughter cause she's pretty fricken awesome. Luckily with how young she is it's not as big of an issue for her but I see how it effects my husband. Which sucks.", "In my husband's defense he is always in my corner, he is just not one to speak up or confront the issue. He just complies and that's where we buttheads. It's coming from a good place but not always productive either.", "I did explain to husband that I will not bite my tongue this time around.", "Even if it were for work, which I truly do not believe it is, every time before has been more important than seeing us and it was all leisure. So I guess it's learning to swallow my pride and realize we can't compete with gambling.", "She was 20 when he spanked her butt in front of our entire family (which they wrote off as \"how he is when he is drunk\") including his own wife. Then when he attempted more than that it was the same excuse. So I don't know where they draw the line.", "The issue is not coming here vs. Vegas. Of course Vegas is more fun! It's them claiming severe illness and that's what is keeping them from coming here but they will miraculously be in good health for Vegas in a couple weeks after that? Just don't lie to us. Be honest.", "The health concerns they are sharing aren't just a sniffle or bug. They will be present in the following weeks guaranteed. I think once a year is more than reasonable as we do the majority of visiting otherwise. Sacrifice one of your four Vegas trips to see your son and grand daughter instead.", "Thank you.", "He does very little for himself and it is important to me he gets this time with his parents. I chose not to go as it's not the best environment for a toddler and I'm also pregnant. They eat, drink, smoke and gamble. Which no judgements as if I was alone with my hubby and not expecting I'd be doing the same. As a momma though, I'm better off at home.", "Yeah divorce isn't our immediate go to in a disagreement, but how mature of you. Sounds like you have a few under your belt.", "INFO: why is your husband going to Vegas and leaving you home to watch your child. Tell his that would be a good place where you all could meet up and celebrate your child\u2019s birthday as his parents seem to suck to come to your home but are well enough to visit Vegas. FYI they do t want to see you.", "Also MIL \"has to\" go to Vegas \"for work\". So it's not exactly a holiday (at least for her) is it?", "You're ruining your husband's trip to Vegas with his sick parents.. how dare you /s", "yeah YTA. You might sit and tell yourself things like \"its their loss\" and pat yourself on the back thinking you're standing up for you, your spouse, the kid,  but in reality you overstepped by going against him and its your kid who will lose out.   \nNot every grandparent will go to heads to visit with a grandchild, you're already being pushy and lacking boundaries now I cant imagine them fighting to see the poor kid as they get older knowing they'll have to deal with you.", "If its for work, then YTA. She doesn't control the itinerary or the timing of the trip. Your husband and FIL are taking advantage of company paid lodging there.\n\nI get your frusteration but pick your battles - this is not one you can win.\n\nAs for your BIL - he is a pig and disgusting. I'm sorry you have to deal with him. Be ready to provide emotional support to SIL when she is ready to leave him. I'm sure she flat out doesn't believe you right now but at some point she will witness his behavior herself and be ready to leave him.", "you're concerned he's going to hit on his 2 year old niece?  i mean, i get not condoning that kind of behavior but avoiding seeing the family altogether seems a little extreme.  i don't know what happened, of course but it just seems extreme to not go out there at all.  of course they want to be able to see their other granddaughter, and it isn't technically their business to get into with him, regarding his behavior.  your SIL should be handling that.  or whatever, i don't know the family dynamic.\n\nanyways, you can't force them to do anything.  extend the invite, have christmas at your house, just keep on doing things the way you planned to do them and if they show up, they show up.  if they don't, they don't.  you just kind of have to accept it.  and let your husband deal with his family.  it's his family.", "Stop expecting it. Stop taking it personally. Let it go and focus your energy on the people who you are closer with.", "That's what makes YTA.  You can't expect *anyone* to love your kid as much as you do.  Get over yourself.", "In Spanish there's is a saying about grandchildren from a daughter are \"loved\" more than the ones from a son. You can replace loved with spoiled or accepted or any similar word. \n\nThis seems to be the case here. \n\nIf I were you, I would talk it out with my husband. \"Your parents don't want to spend time with you and the little one, I'm sorry.\"", "I think it's a simple fact that grandparents are gonna be closer to the kids/grandkids that are....you know.....closer.\n\nThis is something you just have to accept and move on. Trying to force it will never work.", "If I were in your shoes I wouldn\u2019t invite them to anything else but instead let them come to you. I\u2019d rather not have any/much of a relationship than feel like my child is a second rate family member.\n\nYour husband seems to be used to this dynamic and daughters (SIL) do tend to be closer to their mums (MIL) plus they also live closer, but you\u2019ll be worn thin trying to prop up this very one sided connection. \n\nYou\u2019ve said your bit, your husband should back you up and then let your MIL & FIL make the effort.. or not.", "why does it matter so much to you to know every little detail?  maybe they don't want to come see you, and have no way of expressing it truthfully.  not trying to stir up shit, but....maybe it's you.  how often have you meddled in their lives the way you did this time?  i certainly wouldn't want my daughter in law all up in my business if i'm trying to go have fun in vegas on my time.  just saying.", "But it's not a vacation. It's a work related trip. Once you found out that piece you should have dropped it. You just made yourself look foolish.", "You've got years of family dynamics at play here which makes it an uphill battle when one doesn't want to make a change. It works for his parents as they can do what they want.\n\nThere will be probably come a time when they crook their finger and say it's time to lay happy families. That's when your husband will have to make a decision if he will still be the people pleaser.", "What does being on reddit have to do with your failure to communicate with your family about issues, rather than taking the childish route of blasting them on social media. I'm talking about FB, Tik Tok or Instagram, not silly reddit posts.  I may be confused,  but I thought you posted the first issue on one of those sites. Reddit is anonymous.  Those are not. I find people who post their issues on those, and attempt to embarrass their friends and family as horrible people. Those same people often want to talk about it later, but if you post rather than talk. There is nothing that needs to be discussed.  Especially knowing that anything discussed could be on display for everyone", "But your husband is asking you to leave it. Is he as disappointed as you are. \n\nIn my experience (mine and others in my family) if one has problems with in laws it is often related to the relationship with one's own parents.\n\nSincerely, I hope you find peace with this.", "also, don't focus on the \"daughter\" part men &women can be predators & may not have a preference but choose victims by access & ability to get away with it.\n\nStand your ground, let your sister know you support her.", "If he is truly a good husband then you should be able to sit him down and explain to him how your feelings are hurt by their lack of care towards their granddaughter and that he needs to back you up instead of keeping the status quo for them. They obviously are not so unhealthy that they can go to Vegas! He needs to learn to confront them, I know it's not as easy as I wrote as I hate confrontation as well but sometimes it is what has to be done.", "you know, you can support and encourage your husband to reflect on things without directly involving yourself.  his family dynamic is obviously different than yours, and you don't know them well enough (and they don't know you well enough) to make the choice to step in and have it be well received.  i think your husband made it crystal clear that it wasn't a good idea, and hopefully you keep that in mind the next time you feel compelled to step in.", "You sound like a lot. \n\nHere's the thing, you keep saying you don't mind being the bad guy but you're being the bad guy to your husband as well when you go behind his back and put more stress on an already stressful situation. Maybe he's willing to see his parents less to know that when they do get in a visit it's because his parents really want to be there, rather than being guilt tripped into visiting by his pushy wife. Now, if they visit it's going to be awkward as fuck because he's going to have to parse through their motivation.\n\nWhat happens if you push them away? Then your husband looses out and so does your child. And the bottom line is it's not your decision to make. It's your husband's because those are his parents.", "NTA because you were hurt and care more than they do. You didn\u2019t make demands & you were not rude, you conveyed how you feel & let it go. Your husband is afraid to stand up for your family because he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. That is fine. Spend your time and energy on your family who appreciate and want to spend time with you & your daughter. It\u2019s okay to have a closer relationship with them. Hearing about your BIL may force you to take a step back from his side of the family for awhile anyway.", "That puts you in a very hard spot and marital counseling sounds in order for him to learn how to stand up to his parents and to support, protect and prioritize you from their crap.", "Hopefully he divorces you soon.", "And I can sympathize with that. It can be disappointing to learn someone's priorities through their actions rather than what they've told us. I just wanted to address the part where you said that they wouldn't likely have energy to work in Vegas if they didn't have energy to see you.", "Okay, I was curious because there's a huge difference if she's a minor.\n\nYeah, BIL is a creep, and it sounds like your inlaws aren't interested in your little family, but this is your husband's family, and it's his responsibility to handle them.", "I'm very aware now they don't want to see us. I was hoping maybe I was wrong. The event his mother only gets two tickets for every year and my husband has gone years prior. I genuinely want him to go as he doesn't do a lot for himself. I wanted us all to meet when we both visited them in June but they said no to our daughter coming... I only wanted her to come because I said to my husband then \"I don't know another opportunity for her to them otherwise\".", "If they both have health issues they might prefer to stick together to help each other. My husband and I tag team issues like that all the time, pitching in more when the other is struggling. OP made a lot of assumptions and judgements based on how she felt about her family being \"neglected\".\n\nYTA, OP.", "I've answered this same assumption in many other comments already.", "I think you are being a bit harsh. YTA for going behind the husband\u2019s back when he said to leave it alone. The parents can absolutely do what they want with their free time but they are crappy grandparents.", "I've only met them a handful of times due to distance. They don't have to like me, which for your information before this we've had 0 issues and get along plenty fine. I am more disappointed that their own son and his daughter aren't a priority. It's been 2 years.", "If they had to ask for tickets it's not for work, it's optional.", "I did address the \"work trip\" scenario and its not. That aside thank you. I would love to be of support to my SIL when she is ready and would love for our girls to know one another.", "If he was making moves on my sister who is significantly younger and saying degrading disgusting shit to her, no I don't want my daughter around that. I guess it just is what it is.", "Yeah, there is no way older grandparents want to go out of their way to see their grandchildren on a regular basis. While it seems rude, the general rule for most older generations is that the younger people go visit the older people. It will seem like they are spoiling the other grandchild, but they can drive a few minutes to see them, whereas they have to make actual plans for days at a time to see the other kid.", "Vegas 4 times a year and seeing their son and family 0? I can honestly say this is my first time \"meddling\" as I'm defending my family and our feelings. I'm okay being the bad guy. I'd rather that than be silenced. If they don't want to see us I'd appreciate them saying that much more. Rather then all the excuses. We are all adults.", "It\u2019s hardly meddling in their lives lol", "That's the verbiage being used. They are going to an event her work provided tickets for. Not the same.", "I never post on platforms like that. I do genuinely love his parents and respect them as such but I also am a mother and my family's feelings come first. I came to reddit because it is anon. I posted here about the issue with my BIL awhile back. That's what I was referring to. I wanted genuine feedback on the situation and I am mature enough to see now I am partially the asshole.", "I think he is afraid to ruffle any feathers because we live in their old house for free right now. We've been trying to buy it out from them but they always say how they will settle it when they come for Xmas, or our daughter's birthday, the last holiday and they never come.", "I will.", "She most definitely sounds like alot, and if you read her responses it makes her sound even worse.", "He shares all the same feelings as I do. He just tip toes around them more than I do. They never make the effort and it's always been on us. We are both feeling burnt out in being the sole people to maintain this relationship. If we stopped visiting I don't know they'd ever come here. They didn't before I was in picture either.", "Which both my husband and I are in agreement with and his parents seemed to understand. We were super disappointed in the way that whole situation was handled as well but we have not cut off anyone. We were cut off by some for taking a stance.", "Definitely room for improvement there.", "Divorce isn't our type of conflict resolution but excellent suggestion!", "They are blaming YOU for bringing your sister and wrecking their family, because if you hadn't brought her...", "So you went behind your husband's back to confront people you you've only met a handful of times? YTA twice over.", "NTA OP personally I think you have a husband problem here. His parents are using bogus excuses to skip his daughter's B-day and then 2 weeks later he's going on vacation with them. \n\nAll this when his parents seem to have no problems with a 40's married SonInLaw saying all kinds of seriously warped things to a 21 yr old relative.", "i understand, but your daughter is 2.  and he's related to her.  are you concerned he's going to SA her?\n\nedit: you don't want your daughter around someone who behaves like that - got it.", "look man, i don't know, i'm just speculating.  trying so hard to get someone to do something they don't want to, usually gets you nowhere.  maybe they aren't good with being direct and honest.  i don't know.  i do think you need to stop trying to hard and to just accept the situation as it is.  and let your husband handle his family.  or you might start causing problems in your marriage.", "Just stop visiting them.", "They're old and they've raised their family. They have every right to live their life which doesn't revolve around your family. They said no. Respect it, stfu and mind your goddamn business.", "Well the verbiage you used was \"She said she has to go because it's for work\".\n\nNow, you're saying they are merely being provided tickets to an event and it's not in fact work related. Here's the thing you're not getting, you don't know for certain what's going on with his parents. You might think you do, but the bottom line is you only know what they chose to talk about.\n\nThey may have medical conditions and need to see a specialist there 3-4 times a year, so they combine it with a relaxing visit. One of them may be terminally ill and they're going because it's relaxing and how they want to spend what little time they have left together. They may feel overwhelmed visiting your family for some reason (small child, pushy DIL, difficult relationship with son, maybe don't care for  your pets or home...whatever). You're not inside their head so you don't really know. It's inappropriate to automatically jump to the conclusion that they don't care enough to be involved. You're only looking at this from one your own perspective and running around like a bull in a china ship damaging your relationship with them.\n\nThink about pulling back a step and letting your husband take the lead. You don't have like how he handles his family but you should respect his wishes instead of boundary stomping all over them.", "I take back what I said in reference to that. However,  you do have to recognize that you can't question adults about their plans. They informed you of what they wanted you to know.  They're attempting to be respectful and cordial, and you're pushing them in the opposite direction.", "She\u2019s just upset", "You keep saying he shares all the same feelings as you do, BUT HE TOLD YOU TO LET IT BE. The bottom line is you might both agree on the problem but you definitely don't agree on the solution. If you were both in agreement on how to handle it, you wouldn't have had to go behind his back to get your grump on.\n\nAlso, I don't know if anyone has mentioned this yet, but his parents don't own your family time, energy, attention or visits. I know that's hard to hear but they're fully functional adults who have a right to their own lives, priorities and privacy. If we reverse up the situation, no one here would be telling you and your husband that you MUST visit your parents. Nope, they'd say you don't owe them a thing and encourage you to live your own lives as you see fit. That goes both ways.", "That\u2019s your que then to stop putting all the effort in while they extend none.", "i agree, sadly.  i think she thinks she's doing the right thing but she overstepped some boundaries, and doesn't know how to read the room.  they probably don't know her well enough to be ok with her talking to them about how they spend their time.  it's essentially none of her business.  if her husband wants his daughter to be a priority in their lives, he likely knows better how to handle it.", "I did propose the idea maybe he doesn't go. Although I know how much he misses his parents and for his sake would like him to see them. Prior to this and the issue with his sister we have had no issues.", "What the heck is wrong with you, would you be comfortable with having your children around someone who proved themselves to be a predator in front of you? Where is your brain?", "He isn't related. He is my husband's sister's husband... I'm not ruling anything out. I never thought he'd try to touch my sister and ask her to participate in unspoken activities under him and his wife's roof, yet here we are.", "I understand that.", "They have their other granddaughter 5 days a week, overnight. So it's not about them being old. It's the order of priorities.", "You seem to know a lot more about our family than we do.", "If you understand that then accept it for what it is and move on from such expectations before your daughter becomes old enough to understand and internalize this too. Holding on to such high expectations for people, no matter who, that continually show you how unimportant you or your family are will only lead to more hurt and resentment. LET IT GO! It\u2019s seems your husband understands and is able to in-spite if how I\u2019m sure it makes him feel personally because it\u2019s not productive at this point.  YTA for wanting validation they will not give you at the expense of your family. OP seriously contemplate how much discretion  your husband must be using to temper his feelings about his parents and how your actions have hurt him after the fact.", "Being a psychologist means dysfunctional family dynamics are kind of my thing.", "I'd hope you're more professional with your clients.", "I was, right up until I retired. Now, I have the luxury of speaking plainly since this isn't a therapy forum and no one is paying me to be therapeutic."]}
