We also have a daughter who is almost 2. My usband's parents, only sister and husband, and 1 niece live in another state. Since we have been married we have made numerous trips to see them, whether we meet half way or we just come to them. His parents have visited twice since we've been married. His father no longer works and his mother can work from home. Her office is actually in the state we live in as they used to live here too.\n\nIt didn't really bother me until more recently. I posted awhile back about a falling out we had with my husband's sister/HER husband. The last time we visited, we brought my youngest sister for extra hands. This BIL (husband's sister's husband) came onto MY little sister. So we left and will not be returning for awhile. We confided in his parents about what happened and they were equally as appalled but since it's happened everyone wants to pretend like it didn't. Needless to say there's certainly been some tension.\n\nDue to this they promised to come up by us for Xmas and we would alternate each year. They already bailed on that idea because MIL couldn't get anymore days off work. They offered to come for our daughter's bday in Oct instead. Well now that's not happening either due to some health concerns for both MIL and FIL, which I entirely understand and needs to take priority. \n\nThat being said, they vacation every 3/4 months to Vegas... They always can get time off for that and sometimes I wish they would take that time to come see us, which I have expressed. Our daughter's bday is beginning of Oct and they have a trip planned for end of Oct to Vegas. My husband will be joining also. When they officially canceled their trip for our daughter's bday I assumed they'd also be canceling their Vegas trip as they claim they can't take all this time off and their health concerns are keeping them from traveling here. Then my husband shared with me last night they'd be going to Vegas regardless.\n\nI was super confused and super hurt. I asked how severe their health concerns were that they could gamble, drink and smoke but they couldn't spend one weekend with their other grandchild... He said he understood my frustration but to leave it alone. \n\nWell I didn't. I texted MIL to see if their were any updates on their appts regarding their health. She said not really but they were too wiped out to come for our daughter's bday. I followed up by asking if that meant Vegas was canceled too as it was only a few short weeks after? She said she has to go because it's for work and they would see about FIL. \n\nI kindly said how hurt I'd be if they couldn't make it for their granddaughters bday but they could muster up the strength for Vegas of all places. I explained I understood the health concerns, but I don't see how such serious health issues will vanish in a matter of weeks.

I saw you commented that your hubby was ALSO upset about this, and I don't doubt you were both confused and hurt by this.\n\nHe's probably not upset with WHAT you said, exactly, because he likely agrees.  But he asked you not to say anything, and you did.  If this was your own mother that's a green light to let her rip, but honestly you will be better off in the long run by letting him deal with his parents.  If they want to disregard building a relationship that's on them.  You can't force them to prioritize her.\n\nHowever, the bill on this will come due for them down the road, when she's a stranger to them and they don't understand why.\n\nAll you two can do is be on the same page when it comes to your boundaries and navigating those relationships on both sides.  Talk about how you're feeling and have a plan for the future when your daughter is older and 'more fun' for them to be around.  As someone with a toxic MIL that I've had to navigate with extreme care (but we've found acceptable footing after more than a decade of marriage) the best thing you can do is plan ahead.  If your hubby wants to stand up to them/voice his concerns support him as best you can, but just know that the minute you start trying to take the reins you will become the next persona non grata in his family's eyes.\n\nBest of luck to you both!", "YTA. Your husband told you to leave it alone and you didn't. It's their life, their choices. If they want to go to Vegas instead of your daughter's birthday, that's on them.

Obviously things can get in the way but from what happened with SIL and the going to Vegas afterwards, the illness is clearly a superficial excuse.\n\nIf it was me I would be reluctant to allow them to make my child feel \u2018less than\u2019 especially if they begin to show favouritism with their other granddaughter. Their actions show they aren\u2019t really interested in having a closer bond so don\u2019t try to force it.", "YTA. You went behind your husbands back and complained about this to his mother.

Better to let go of this disappointed now than to let it keep eating at you.", "Soft YTA. A lot of time I do not ask my parents things because I already know the answer, and asking will be more work than just moving on.

Would it be nice for your child to see their grandparents and grow their relationship? Of course. But they clearly don't want to. Your husband should have contacted his parents. Going forward you'll just have to expect them not to want to come. If they wanted to, they would.

You're going to be much happier the sooner you stop caring if they show up or not.", "NTA. Your husband's parents are going to be the kind of grandparents that it's all on their terms and with a certain level of hypocrisy. I understand where this is coming from as my in-laws are the same way. \n\nGiven that your husband is okay with being sloughed off by his own parents you'll probably have to go with it, but it can hurt when you see a slight against your own child aka their grand-daughter.\n\nI don't agree with the other comments that you shouldn't have called as you are either a part of the family or not. Parents don't get to pick and choose if and when their DIL or SIL gets upset. I guess they do, but you are all adults and you called them on it. The MIL is a brat to whine to her son, but that's the way it falls sometimes. Family dynamics at play. Your husband is probably upset because he just wants to avoid rocking the boat. You are entitled to be hurt, but I would leave them alone at this point.\n\nThis is from my perspective of 26 years trying to do the right thing with MIL and SIL and fed up now so take my comments with a grain of salt. My decision is to stay away from them, but at the same time if they ask my opinion I'm nit sugarcoating anymore. \n\nIn some ways look at this as a blessing, as you can do the holidays your way, create your own traditions without their input. It is their loss.", "Screw her and your husband for not standing up to his asshole parents and defending his wife and child.

And ran away.\n\nSo the truth is out: Mil doesn't want to bother with OP's child, and won't say as much stai9ght out, though it may have to do with the BIL.\n\nOf course it's the in-laws' right to be non-participating grandparents, though Op says it \"hurts.\" \n\nWhere the sin lies, I think, is the husband's refusal to deal honestly with this and tell OP what's really going on.", "As someone who suffers chronic health issues, I'll tell you: sometimes we have to forgo things in order to \"charge\" for whatever upcoming obligation we have.

You caused more issues which is really going to keep them away.", "YTA- mostly for overstepping when your husband said not to. \n\nYour in-laws seem open to you visiting them, so it's probably not some personal issue against your family.

Does that automatically require them to be sick for the entire month and cancel the other trip they have planned and paid for?  Are you the sick police?  They have come to you twice in 2 years and you say that you also meet halfway or go there. That seems like quite a few visits given the distance.  More than some local families probably get together.  People have lives and aren\u2019t going to use all their time off to visit grandkids.", "NTA.  \nMIL / FIL have thier priorities off.

I know that's hard to hear but they're fully functional adults who have a right to their own lives, priorities and privacy.

First the obviously live close, there is no vacation time needed to see her, and no travel money needed. Secondly, you start this post by saying what a pig and disgusting ahole your BIL is, so much so you don\u2019t want to be around him. Do you think maybe there is a connection there as to why your in-laws take his daughter so often? \nMaybe,  just maybe, with SIL husband being such an ass your in-laws need to be more involved with your SIL and niece, bc unlike you they can\u2019t simply avoid him by leaving the state. \n\nSo maybe this isn\u2019t a bit about you. You stated you only met them a handful of times, so maybe they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing what is going on with their daughters or her child, for fear you would be just as judgmental about that as how they spend what appears to be their very limited free time.\n\nI get it sucks to have to be the one always making the trip to maintain a relationship, but sometimes simple due to expense, health, or other family issues that is just the case.

Not at all concerned about their granddaughter with us as we will not condone that behavior.\"\n\nYour MIL and FIL pretended nothing happened your BIL hitting on and sexually harassing your sister to appease your SIL and have access to their other grandchild. They make little effort for your child, and seem they don't care. So why would you want them in her life?\n\nThere's a saying \"if they want to, they will.\"", "YTA. Not only because you butted in after your husband told you not to but also your story is changing with each comment.  It's a work trip, it's not a work trip. It's because of their health but their healthy enough a month later so you don't think it's really their health but you've been concerned about their health for a month or so. They ignore hubby but he is going to Vegas with them.", "YTA. So you went behind your husbands back to speak to HIS parents after he told you to leave it alone, you are trying to frame a work trip as a vacation and you live for free in your ILs house that they clearly don\u2019t want to sell to you yet you keep pushing the issue and blame them for something that had absolutely nothing to do with them. Also their health concerns are none of your business full stop. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re adding drama by procrastinating from the real problem, your husband.", "YTA. Let it go.", "NTA.  So confused that people think you are.  I would also be frustrated at such a one-sided relationship, and more than a bit concerned your husband isn't more upset that his parents can't seem to make time to see their granddaughter.\n\nNo, they don't have to revolve their lives around their grandchild, but it would be nice if they tried.  I say this as a woman who did not have close relationships with her grandparents because one was unwell my whole life, (completely understandable), and the other just didn't seem interested.", "NTA. \n\nI would just tell your husband that the ball is in his parent's court. It is up to them to actually plan and carry out a visit because they don't appear to be interested in seeing you and your daughter. \n\nYour daughter comes first and you don't want her to end up wondering why his parents have no interest in seeing her as she grows up. She deserves better than being treated as less than her cousins. If your parents are there for her give them the first option of holiday visits. \n\nA relationship is a 2 way thing and requires effort on both parts. Your MIL and FIL appear to make an effort to see your husband but no effort to see you and your daughter. There might be more going on than you realize.\n\nDrop the rope and focus on your daughter. If your husband wants a relationship with his family let him have it. But consider going LC to NC with them to protect your daughter.", "YTAH. Snot nosed kids vs. Vegas. You do the math. Not everyone fawns over kids. She already raised her kids. She is probably attempting to be polite but you're not getting the message for some reason.", "A slight AH. Your husband's family, let him deal with it. I get why you feel slighted or hurt, I would too. The one thing you can manage though is your visits to them. If they can't make it a priority to see your family, there is no need to make them a priority.", "YTA. \nIt\u2019s definitely frustrating that they are never around to see your daughter, but equally they have no obligation to. You can\u2019t really expect them to cancel a work trip (especially since you said MIL takes a lot of time off to visit people) because you want them to see your daughter. All three of them going is probably  the safest thing to do of the health scares are just FIL and MIL needs to work.\n\nNgl the story at the beginning with your sister was kinda irrelevant IMO", "YTA - your husband gets to handle HIS family how he wants. He asked you to leave it, but you just had to be meddlesome.", "\"She said she has to go because it's for work and they would see about FIL.\" that's why yta", "Gentle YTA. OP, they don't seem to care for your child and you. They don't want to do anything to have a good relationship with you. Why do you want them around?\n\nLet them go OP. It's their loss. Apologize to your husband and share you just wished that your child got grandparents' love that's all. And tell him that henceforth you're not going to invite them for anything. If they truly wished to have relationship, they can do something about it. You quit now.\n\nMake your baby's birthday special. Have fun with your side of family present.", "What's the story with your husband joining them in Vegas? I couldn't find a reply about that. Does he always join in with their gamble-fests? Who pays for it? Is possibly missing out on the Vegas trips why he doesn't want them bothered? I see lots of comments that he isn't the golden child, but they seem to be including him in their holidays so I don't get how anyone sees that. I'd give up on expecting a relationship with any of them. The husband...I don't know what he's about. I think maybe ESH, but I understand where you're coming from. It would be better if they just said they didn't want to visit, instead of making up excuses.

They're retired and always seem to be away, which is good for them, but they'll say oh we haven't seen you for ages and expect us to go to them. We live 3 miles from them, both work, have teenagers that have activities, but we're expected to find the time to go to them. It does annoy us.  \n\nBut here's the thing, our kids are at the age that they notice this and aren't bothered too much about seeing them and that is entirely on the grandparents, because we've made the effort.", "Her husband isn't standing up to his parents. If he were then he wouldn't still be going to Vegas with them, and without his wife and daughter.", "If they don't wanna be around the kids tell them since Vegas is more important than your granddaughter how about I stead of every time your supposed to see her go to Vegas", "So well put! Thank you for being eloquent because I can't be! I feel like the MIL feels like she had her kids, she's done with that and now just wants to go to Vegas. I could be wrong but that would be what I meant.", "I would just let the relationship go with the in-laws. 'Drop the rope' as they say. Only put in the same amount of effort that they do.", "I'm afraid I have to disagree.\n\nNow I'm leaning towards YTA as well, but only because of that very last bit about the Vegas trip being for work. If it's actually necessary for work than OP has no point- you can't have a go at somebody for going to work and then not coming to see you if they know the work is going to knacker them.\n\nIf this is all a polite fiction though, then the grandparents are definitely the assholes. \"Polite fictions\" can go to hell, if OP has been making plans around them visiting then telling lies is the opposite of polite, it's showing her lack of respect and some disdain. If she's not \"getting the hint\" they need to be honest with her.\n\nWithout being sure of the facts I'd say ESH.", "Okay, thats fair and I understand that now. I'm the asshole! We don't do birthday parties though for all those sams reasons. They were simply coming up here for the weekend of her birthday to celebrate.", "You're right. I think I got my answer and will need to take some time to reflect and mend.", "He is an amazing husband and I'll say that until I'm blue in the face. It's a lot easier for me to go LC because they are not my parents, ya know? I studied child psychology and development. Sadly there will always be a desire to accomplish your parents approval. No matter how deep down it may be or how much you try and block it out. My husband has a lot of feelings in the situation himself that I don't all understand but need to respect. I do agree though that I need to stop forcing or trying to force people to want to spend time with us. We have plenty of people who do and our daughter is well supported. My husband just really longs for the same with his parents and his child.", "Thank you. Finally, a reasonable response.", "I'm simply responding and I've commented on many and most posts that aren't in my favor admitting where I was wrong. I understand that I owe my husband an apology for going against his wishes. That was a bad move on my part. Although I won't apologize for respect expressing how I feel. I've done enough bottling up for the both of us in my life time and the stay silent approach doesn't resolve much either.", "One weekend. They have plenty of PTO for other travels. And we don't do birthday parties. It's just to celebrate her birthday which they offered to come because they canceled on Christmas as well.", "The trip to Vegas is for a popular convention. My husband goes with them every year for this event. I do not go because MIL doesn't have enough passes, I don't want to leave my daughter for that and now I am pregnant. This will most likely be the last time he sees them for awhile and I am sure he doesn't want to jeopardize that. I just want honesty regardless of how much it hurt. The lies are so much more reckless", "They may be pissed at how you handled the BIL. Also they are retired and over children. At least I would be.", "So she disrespects his direct wishes and he\u2019s still the asshole? Make it make sense. There\u2019s nothing to stand up to them about. OPs the one causing the issues. Also he\u2019s allowed to go and help his parents on a work trip he\u2019s also allowed to go with his parents somewhere. Just because you\u2019re married doesn\u2019t mean you are attached at the hip. That\u2019s unhealthy and why does this sub seem to think Moms are incapable of being alone with their own children for a few days?  The world will not end because OP has to be a solo parent for a few days.", "Maybe it is the DIL they are avoiding and everyone is just not saying it to her face. The husband telling her to leave it might be because he knows why they don't want to visit and doesn't want his wife's feelings hurt.", "If it's actually for work and FIL has health problems husband might be a long to help with that while MIL is working", "Read the damn post. She's not going to strip club in Vegas, but strictly for work so they can keep a roof over their head and food on the table.

I know it hurts you since they don\u2019t seem to show much interest. My family was like this. I spent years trying to get them to just care about my family. They never did.

The parents have been visiting one time per year. I have to suspect that if they wanted more than once a year, they'd manage it, somehow.\n\nIt seems like such a shame that \"things\" are always messing with their plans to visit. \n\nAgain, close scrutiny would tell you that if they had vacation time to visit for the birthday but cancelled those plans, then they would still have vacation time to visit at another time. Please don't scrutinize too closely.", "At the end of the day they\u2019re not your parents. Just enjoy your parents company and post pics with those grandparents", "This is 100% about your feelings. Your husband said to leave it alone, and your daughter is 2. When I was a kid, my grandparents saw my cousins who lived nearby a lot more than they saw me, and that made perfect sense to me. They were near. I was far. It won't be a huge deal to your daughter unless you make it one. You're poking around for information about their health, which is none of your business. You're asking because you don't trust them. You implied that they're liars. Maybe they are, but you're not gaining anything by making the accusation. Your husband knows them better than you do, and he said to leave it alone.", "They don't want to see you. They are not obligated to do so. Move on with your life.

I'm not saying you were wrong, I'm just offering up a reason.", "You cannot force or expect people to spend time with your kid. The reality is that your inlaws aren't involved in your child's live, and they don't choose to be. It sucks, it's unfair, but that's what they've chosen. I also deal with inlaws who are uninvolved. That's their choice. They're always welcome but I'm not actively finding ways to involve them. If they want to be involved, that's on them. Let go of your expectations and enjoy a little more freedom.", "The parents are not worth, they are willing to side with the SIL/BIL to have their kid on their lifes, this already say a lot about them.. \n\nJust stop to go to their house too, if they are so unwilling to see your child, if is up to you, they will never see her again in this lifetime.", "You are just being a big baby and a AH. No wonder they won\u2019t visit. I wouldn\u2019t either. \ud83d\ude44", "I am astonished that so many people here are judging you as the AH.\n\nI'd be pretty miffed too in your shoes. \n\nYour in-laws clearly have a favourite child and it is not your husband nor, by extension, his family.\n\nIn many other posts, redditors pile in on 'golden' children but for some reason, everyone here seems to consider your BIL the golden child too and are quite happy with that.\n\nHowever your husband feels, he clearly does not want to deal with his parents, is clearly happy being subordinate to his brother and is quite content with him and his family being thought less of by his parents. If he was truly concerned with how you feel or how your child feels, he would have dealt with them by now. He has not.\n\nFor whatever reason, your in-laws do not care about your husband, or you, as much as they care about your creepy BIL's family. But I wonder why you feel it is so important for you to have a relationship with them? These are people who happily supported a middle-aged married man that tried to chat up a girl young enough to be his daughter. And they are happy with that. They would clearly have been happy if your sister had accepted his invitation and had sex with him. Ask yourself, do you really want people like this to have a role/presence in your children's lives?\n\nAs much as I would be irritated and hurt by my partner's refusal to stand up for his family, you have to accept they want nothing to do with you.\n\nPersonally, I would reciprocate their indifference and refuse, henceforth, to travel to see them or to permit them to see your kids. However, it would be wrong to tell your husband he cannot see his parents. He can do what he likes.\n\nI'm going to say NAH. They can see who they want, or not, but you have every right to involve yourself in a situation your husband is too cowardly to address. You've tried your best. Time to let it go.", "Exactly. They don't don't want to be around you. It is personal and yet, they owe you nothing.", "But that\u2019s the problem you don\u2019t get to decide how people spend their time.", "But they don\u2019t owe you that weekend. You\u2019re not entitled to their time. Would it be nice if they wanted to come and visit you all? Yeah, but it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want to. And that\u2019s okay. And as far as your husband asking you to drop it you really should have. That\u2019s his family to deal with as he so chooses. Not yours. And you\u2019ve now made issues between them that he didn\u2019t want you to make and regardless of how you feel about your MIL your husband doesn\u2019t deserve you forcing him to have problems with his mom. That\u2019s unfair.", "What difference would it have made if they said \"we prefer to spend vacation in Vegas\"? No difference at all.\n\nMaybe I see things differently because I have lived away from my family for a long time now. I love (LOVE!) them, but I don't want to spend my entire vacation at anyone's house. I will do it in small doses, but ugh, I just prefer my own space. I'm good with kids, but once again not what I may want to do my whole vacation.", "I have to agree with u/Temporary-King3339. I've dealt with very similar with my in-laws, with oddly enough, my MIL & FIL being the exceptions. I finally decided if anyone didn't think my little family was worth the effort, I wasn't going to waste any effort on them. From then on, it was on them or my husband to make sure his family saw our kids, and I bet you can guess how much they saw them. LOL! (My side of the family always made the effort for my kids.) He had cousins that we'd randomly run into that saw my kids more than his some of his family who live less than a mile away. There's been many times the bitching and whining has gotten back to me and I just laugh. If they wanted a place in my kids' lives, they should've acted like it. If it ever becomes an issue where your daughter notices, it's a perfect time to teach her that all people are different and just because they can't appreciate how awesome she is, it doesn't make her any less awesome, it just shows how flawed they are. Since your husband wants you to 'leave it alone', do it... leave it up to him to deal with them and facilitate them seeing your kid, and if it doesn't happen (which sounds likely), it's on him or them and the choice they make.", "If he did that to your sister he is probably doing to other girls. If he becomes a border agent he could be a danger to women entering the country, particularly if he has a position of authority over them.\n\nIt was your sister's choice not to file a police report but realistically she probably should have.

If they come to you, there is no leaving without seeming rude. It's a trip to see you, it's a stop to see them. \n\nWhether it's right or not, most older people expect the younger people to make the effort because they have already made the effort. If they don't want to spend days at your house, away from where they are comfortable, to take care of a child (you may not see it that way, but a child ends up being watched by all adults around), and omit a vacation, because you feel like the kid deserves it... it's not going to happen.\n\nGo visit them... or dont... but you extended the invitation. There is nothing for you to do except let them say no.", "Maybe they don't like you or your kids. You did get uppity with your sister and your BIL.", "and you don't get to determine their priorities.\n\nand also, frankly, they are doing you a favor. You know where your family rates in their order of priorities, and you can plan your holidays, vacations and important moments accordingly. When people tell you who they are, believe them", "You seem to get pretty rude in your responses when your behaviour gets criticized. If you only want opinions from those who're experts on your family dynamics then why are you here? Ask someone who intimately knows your family.", "Maybe? Lol like it matters. YTA in this scenario.", "Her pointing out the actions of the BIL is most likely why they don't like her. Is it fucked up? Sure! But they obviously don't want drama in their lives whether it is valid or not. That's my guess as to why they are icing her out and I', shocked that this explanation has not crossed OP's mind.", "Again, not going on vacation, learn to read properly before getting worked up \ud83d\ude12", "Their \"stop\" is an 18+ hour drive. With a toddler and I'm 5 months pregnant... They do not stay at our home when they visit either. They stay in a hotel and my daughter won't even let them watch her as she is sp unfamiliar with them. So all that is false. We have a lot less flexibility than they do honestly.", "Did you just refer to her reaction to a man in his 40s sexually harassing her 21yro sis to the point she's in tears as being 'uppity'?", "I've commented on a lot of YTA comments agreeing with or thanking people for shedding light on things I might have missed. Certain comments deserve some back lash. If can't take it don't dish it.", "Perhaps you should go back and reread OP comments. They are going to a public event that is not mandatory and they had to ask the company for tickets. Add in they average 4 trips to Vegas every year. How does this not be at least partly a vacation? \n\nThe company is not paying their travel expenses, it's not a work requirement, and you're saying it's not a vacation? Then what is this trip?", "\"It's a stop to see them\" I believe was referring to visiting the other grandchild.\n\nI'm sorry that you're going through this, but I do think you were wrong. You can't force fairness or connectedness.", "Okay.. that context is helpful. Unfortunately, they have a favorite, and it's not your husband. Which is probably why he wanted you to let this go. \n\nI think it's time to move on for this idea and not extend any more invitations. Maybe try finding other people to spend the holidays with, your family or a group of friends. Sorry, but you aren't going to win these people over.", "Okay.. that context is helpful.

I've seen this in my own family. Brother #1 was never the favorite (which was really unfair of my parents). He had three kids. They just did not rate compared to Brother #2's kids. Ever. Brother #1 asked me once if I thought our parents were unfair about how they regarded the grandkids, and I thought for about a quarter of a second and said \"Yeah. They're not fair to your kids.\" They were fine with mine, but . . . not his. Brother #2 was always the golden child, and his kids were the golden grandchildren. It wasn't fair in any way, but all I could do is treat them all the same and say \"Yeah, mama and daddy can be jerks.\" Brother #1 just kind of distanced himself when he could, and I couldn't blame him.", "I've seen you being rude to multiple people who simply told you to stop harassing your in laws and respect that they have the right to live their lives without being guilt tripped. That's completely fair criticism. With all due respect, criticizing your behaviour does not deserve backlash. It's not a case of 'if you can't take it, don't dish it' but a matter of 'if you don't support my false sense of victimhood, I'll simply be rude to you.'", "They don\u2019t have a favorite, they have one kid who lives down the street and one who lives 18 hours away. Of course they\u2019re going to be closer to the one they see everyday."]}
