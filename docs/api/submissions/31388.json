Now Bastian has been sending me messages calling me a POS and Jake just send me a loooong voice message saying that he can't pay me but that I should do that to be a good person and if I don't do it he wouldn't be able to be happy with his love. I feel angry because of the arrogant way Bastian talked to me but I also kinda feel bad because Jack was a good friend and his parents are really mean but I have my own life too and that would mean to also lie about myself with even my parents. \n\nPd: Sorry for my bad English. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700520808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1801npg/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_i_will_only_be/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The raging entitlement won't end here - agree to beard and they'll probably end up making up a huge fake scandal about you once you finally leave so that he can go \"oh I'm still not over her\" to explain future behavior.

Spend your free time as a fake partner and give up you own private life. You can't meet others, go on a date, because you have to be this fake gf?

Five dollars per hour is super reasonable, so it\u2019s not like you were trying to rip him off. Hopefully he can see that to soften the fact that you made it transactional and help the three of you rewind.\n\nAt the end of the day, they have no right to expect this of you. Their reaction makes me feel like they just wanted to use you. And yours makes me feel like you aren\u2019t willing to support them as a friend.

The whole 'te is money' thing was stupid. If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so and explained why. By asking for money, you made it seem like their idea had merit, and that you endorsed the idea, so long as you could benefit.
