That is very tacky and inconsiderate of your SIL.\n\nJust tell her no. If she presses, tell her the truth that they are for your use not hers. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your property, you can do what you like with it, which includes loaning it out, or NOT loaning it out.", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty presumptuous of her to ask. Just tell her no, you'd like to be the first person to use your present. Then tell MIL you know a good gift for SIL for Christmas.", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to your gift whatsoever. She sounds like a kid that tries to take other kids gifts at their birthday party lol. Don\u2019t feel bad for her just because she\u2019s tight on money either. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s so tight on money that she\u2019s asking you to help her buy food. She\u2019ll still survive without having access to your crafting supplies", "NTA. Tell her you've already started a project and can't lend it out yet. If she keeps on going, tell her you already promised it to another friend. Keep it going until she gets the hint or moves on. Unless she needs it for a legit business and PROMISES to give it back in one piece,  don't feel bad for not sharing.", "NTA. I don't feel like you ever have to let someone use something that you don't want to share but it's a especially understandable not to give someone permission to use a new present that you are looking forward to using. I do kind of feel like she may be TA because why would she ask for something so new? It's not like you've had it sitting around unopened for years.", "NTA.\n\nIt's rude and entitled for her to have even asked. It's YOUR gift", "Nta its your.. they want one that can go buy their own", "NTA. And be sure to keep it locked away.", "NTA. Her issues are not your problem, and it shouldn\u2019t weigh on your decision to lend something you don\u2019t feel comfortable lending her.", "NTA. I hate it when that happens. People need to reign in on their sense of entitlement to your stuff. Just because someone has less or more does not mean you owe it to them. Do not feel guilty. It would have been different if you weren't planning on using it. Then by all means. But in the end it is upto you and whether you are comfortable with the idea or not.", "NTA.\n\nYou just got it and haven't even had a chance to use it yourself yet!", "NTA. \n\nJust kindly tell her no, that you haven't opened it yet but once you start using it, you will let her know. That is polite avoidance with a good excuse and a firm boundary. \n\nWhen you open it and start using it, invite her over to use it with you (weeks or months from now). But don't give it to her, especially when you haven't used it yet and you don't trust you will get it back in one piece. \n\nIf she pushes back- which I imagine she will do over text- just give a polite \"sorry, that won't work right now, but looking forward to exploring how to use it after the holidays, maybe we can have a wine and wood party!\" and then ignore any other responses and/or change the subject.", "NTA. Its yours. You don't have to share anymore.", "NAH.\n\nShe asked, you refused. Both were reasonable.", "She can buy her own wood burner at harbor freight for less than $10. She's just greedy. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIt is extremely rude.", "NTA. \n\nFor one, it\u2019s your gift. You recently got it, of course you may not immediately use it yet. \n\nMIL had no right to even ask- that\u2019s very disrespectful and inconsiderate of her. What if *you* wanted to use it for gifts? Or for other reasons? I can understand if she\u2019s on a tight budget, but she shouldn\u2019t have you a part of it unless you were the one who approached to aid first.\n\nI would\u2019ve probably reacted the same way, I\u2019d feel offended by the question honestly. I\u2019m an artist and to me that\u2019s someone I know taking advantage of my materials and art experience.", "NTA. Just say no, you haven't used it yet so she'll have to wait.", "NTA. Telling her no, she can\u2019t, since you haven\u2019t had a chance to use it yet yourself is perfectly valid.", "NAH. It wasn't rude of her to ask. It also wasn't rude of you to say no. You should work out your overall issues with your SIL; I think you're getting to the \"bitch eating crackers\" zone where you'll find some reason to get upset at literally everything she says or does.", "YTA. Why is rude of her to *ask*? She hasn\u2019t threatened you, yelled, or from the sounds of it done anything other than ask to borrow something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's been two weeks. She may not know you haven't had a chance to use it yet, or she may just have thought it would be okay *because* you haven't been using it yet. Either way, the question was asked and answered. Why does it need to be a bigger thing?", "Absolutely not the ahole.", "NTA. And honestly it\u2019s kinda rude for her to ask.", "NAH. Jeez people are freaking out. She asked, you said no. Problem solved, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s like mean or something? She just asked?", "NAH. She might not know that you haven't even used it yet. It isn't rude to ask, if she is pushy about it though (or demanding) then that would be rude for sure. It could be that their family has a more sharing type attitude where everyone freely borrows and lets borrow as long as they ask and the loaner is willing. She probably considers you family enough to ask. Just tell her you plan on using it, so sorry you can't loan it.", "NTA.  Now you know what to get them for Christmas.", "Maybe at the back of her mind this was part of her motivation for asking. If you said yes, she got to use it, if not, you'd know what to buy her for the holidays/her birthday/some other gift-giving occasion.", "That\u2019s what my mom said but I hope she wouldn\u2019t think I was being petty. As you guys can see I  am anxious mess :)", "Yeah, those kits are not expensive. Maybe SIL doesn't have $10 NTA", "Oh I am. I have very much tried almost everything with her and I feel like she doesn\u2019t give a shit about me unless she needs something. But that\u2019s another nut to crack lol", "Reread the title. \n\n__AITA for not letting someone use a present I haven\u2019t even used yet?__\n\nIt's not that sil asked, it's the saying NO to the asking.", "She's had it for two weeks. At best. You don't think that seems a little fast to be asking to borrow something?", "Well you're a glass half full person", "Just include a note with the wood-burning kit gift about how you are excited to explore this new hobby \\*with her\\*.\n\nNTA.", "Not really, honestly. I can\u2019t imagine why asking to borrow something would be a problem unless it comes with a nasty attitude when told no, which doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s happened here.", "She does say that SIL is used to getting her way. OP is NTA for not wanting to share her new toy, new or not."]}
