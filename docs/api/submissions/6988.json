You didn't steal their children. You gave them the opportunity to do right and they didn't. That was their choice and failure.

Do I think you did the right thing by calling the police?  100% absolutely.  Do I necessarily agree with letting CPS take the kids instead of just staying with them?  Not really.  It must have been absolutely terrifying for them.  I have a very close friend who works for CPS.  They do everything in their power to help parents keep or regain custody of their kids.

The goal of CPS is to do What Is BEST for the children.  Ideally that is keep them with their parents for various mental and emotional reasons, but we don't live in an ideal world and sometimes the emotional and mental damage of being removed is found to be less then staying.

If you lose yours, you were doing something very wrong.", "Exactly right.

Sometimes physical risk, which is why you need to protect yourself and your location from your brother. Good for you for reporting the harassing calls to the social worker. Be safe. \n\nRemember, even if leaving the kids on your doorstep is what got them removed from the home, YOU ARE NOT THE CAUSE. Your brother and SIL did this. They made the decision to leave the children unattended on your doorstep. You told them you would not be there and would report them to the police. They did it anyway. If it wasn\u2019t this, it would be something later. Your actions saved those kids from more neglect later. \n\nNTA.

May you be happy and blessed together.", "Also remember, you\u2019re not responsible for splitting a family apart, you\u2019re responsible for keeping the kids together. Without you stepping up, their chances of staying together in foster care is slim, and they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to maintain family contacts. \n\nTheir actions got their kids removed from them.

Police don\u2019t lay charges with parents who arrange suitable childcare before having a night out. They literally abandoned their kids. The fact that they did so on your doorstep doesn\u2019t make it your responsibility to cover for them. \n\nFocus on the kids.

I was 5 or 6. i did really well until the day my mom got a call that i was on the monkey bars hanging upside down but apparently forgot to wear my undies.

Plus, so many bad things happened then that went unreported, but the kids who suffered those bad things grew up to have their own kids and were much more cautious with them. \n\nAnecdotally, for example, I have so many friends who were molested as kids by neighbors, babysitters, local teens, bus drivers, older kids, etc. while unsupervised after school in the 70s & 80s into the early 90s, and most have grown up to be incredibly careful about who they let around their kids and not leaving their kids alone or letting them walk home from school without supervision at 6.\n\nSo what we see is parents being much more careful which makes people think the world isn\u2019t as safe now, but the reason they\u2019re much more careful is that their parents weren\u2019t and it was to their detriment.", "ding ding ding and to be honest, i was *extremely* surprised they even ended the night and went for the kids at 3am.
