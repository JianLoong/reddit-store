{"id": 1422, "submission_id": "ymeu3f", "title": "WIBTA if I don't add a guy back on snap?", "selftext": "I (F, upperclassman) was sitting in my high school lobby waiting for school to be over for the day (context: I student teach in a younger grade classroom 3 days a week for half the school day, so on those days when I walk back to highschool I wait in the lobby for 20-15 minutes for the bell to ring so I can get a ride home from a friend who attends all classes at high school) I had my AirPods in my ears and was listening to music. while scrolling on Instagram.\n\nMy back was on a wall and my feet were in front of me, my backpack by my feet. About 5 minutes before the end of the day bell rang, and the gym class let out. (I'm pretty sure it is an all-male gym class) A handful of guys (6-10 people) come out and hang around in the lobby talking to each other. They kept making quick movements and semi-loud comments (that I don't remember the context of) that caused me to bat my eyes up a few times before returning my attention back to my phone screen.\n\nA minute or so later I feel someone standing near me and I turn my gaze to see a guy standing there with his phone in his hand. He says to me:\n\n\"Are you from Tennessee, because you are the only ten I see, can I have your snap?\" I looked at him before responding \"Uh sure\" in a very confused tone and opened up my snap chat. His snap code was on my screen and I just took a screenshot so I have his code but didn't add him.\n\nHe then walked away back to his friends and they all sort of talked but my attention was on my phone texting my friend about what happened. I then grabbed my stuff and walked to another part of the school to await for the bell to ring.\n\nthe whole thing made me very uncomfortable and I got bad vibes from the guy. I myself identify under the AroAce spectrum and I thought I was going to throw up.\n\nI have never seen this kid ever and had no idea who he was.

The best response to this sort of request is, \"Since I teach here, I do not give out my social media.\"", "NTA...", "How is there any benefit to you by adding him? NTA", "you WNBTA if you didn't add him. you don't have to add people if you don't want to, especially if they make you uncomfortable.", "NTA\nIf you dont feel comfortable to add him, You dont need to add him.", "NTA. \n\nHold your boundaries. If he says anything, just respond, \"Sorry, you caught me off guard. I don't add people I don't know.\"", "NTA. Protect yourself. Always trust your gut. I am in my 30's, so I don't quite get the hype around snapchat. But just like phone #'s, don't feel obligated to exchange them. You don't owe him or anyone else your contact info, your time, your friendship...nothing. be safe my dear. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c"]}
