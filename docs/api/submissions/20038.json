Craig laughed and said \u201che needs to hear this\u2026 thank god I\u2019m here aye the boy needed a father figure like me he\u2019s been coddled by women all his life.\u201d \n\nY\u2019all I was in SHOCK!!! Like I could not believe my ears. My husband had to step out because he was starting to laugh.\n\nI asked him if he was being serious and he was all like \u201cI\u2019m being serious, that boy is a damn airhead because he\u2019s never had a father in his life. Tough love is what we do best, that\u2019s why sons need two parents. Dads to toughen their boys up and moms to coddle them after. You throw off that balance and you get a boy acting like a dumb blonde girl\u2014like my step son.\u201d \n\nI just grabbed my girls and left. My sister chased after us and was all like \u201cwe haven\u2019t even eaten yet and Craig\u2019s gonna yell at me for wasting his time\u2026 please don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d \n\nI told her I was sorry but unlike her, I have self respect and won\u2019t sit there listening to his bullshit. Maybe she can, hell maybe she agrees but that is HER problem and I am NOT making it mine.\n\nShe started to cry and said I was taking it way too far. I don\u2019t have to like Craig but some respect would be nice. Besides, it\u2019s not like Craig was saying anything to me, and he has a point about tough love. \u201cyou know I love my son but c\u2019mon it\u2019s true he isn\u2019t the brightest, Craig\u2019s just trying to help in his own way.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at her and told her that I\u2019m glad Craig\u2019s money makes her so happy that she\u2019s willing to lose her fucking mind. She just started crying again and called me a bitch. My husband had to drag me to the car.\n\nHe told me that I was being a bit harsh. My daughters even said that I should calm down. When we got home, my mom called me and said to please give my sister a break because yeah he\u2019s a dick but at least he can provide for her unlike the other men she\u2019s dated/married. Apparently this is the best they all think she\u2019s going to get and I\u2019m ruining it for her. I\u2019m also failing to put myself in her shoes. I\u2019m just pissed off.

And I don\u2019t intend to tell you that you were wrong. Leaving a conflict or potential conflict is always an option, and sometimes the best one. I wasn\u2019t there, so how can I better evaluate than you? Every choice presents different potential benefits and losses and productive and destructive second third order effects. There are a couple of other things that your kids might have learned if you\u2019d chosen a different course. They could have learned how to stand up for someone else who is being mistreated. They could have learned another way of handling conflict with someone whose views don\u2019t reflect their own. In the words you used to express your values and beliefs, they could have learned why you don\u2019t believe as he does and how his beliefs might impact others. In a follow up conversation with your kids, which you might well have had, you could have expanded your explanation and checked their understanding of your words and events. The misogynistic, arrogant, unkind jerk might also later reflect on your words and learn something, even if that\u2019s unlikely. My only point is that using words can present other opportunities and is an option. Certainly, using words gives an opening for a counter-response that could be unpleasant and unproductive. Taking the risk also gives your kids an opportunity to learn how to handle that. I am a big believer in teaching as many non-destructive options for navigating the world, interactions with others, and coping as possible. On a final note, kids are going to be exposed to all kinds of things from which we\u2019d rather protect them. Including bullying, unkindness, and the misogyny that permeates much of the world. Maybe there\u2019s ultimately a benefit to them encountering those things in the presence of a an adult who can offer explanations, different points of view and values, and help kids better contextualize what they see, hear, and experience?

This very clearly is not a man who would reflect or even listen to another view and is very used to not hearing the word \u201cno\u201d. So, in my opinion, OP still made the best choice. No child, no matter their age, should have to witness stuff like that. It\u2019s bad enough they had to watch their cousin being mistreated and insulted.

Stay away from him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: had a blonde friend who was a beauty pageant in her youth, she dealt with a ton of dudes like these.", "All of this comment! The world is nothing without dreamers and also OP do not let your sister be isolated by the waste of space that is her abusive husband, she needs to know she has a support unit around her", "Literally the evil stepdad. Jesus. I feel for that kid. I can understand the mom wanting security..but at the cost of your childs upbringing? NTA. Please fight for your nephew....as well as your sister.", "NTA - seems like your sister really needs that wake up call, is being with an abusive misogynistic AH really worth it for his money? No, there are always better options.\n\nYour mom is also an AH for going with it and trying to tell you to do so as well. Aren't parents suppose to wish for the best for their kids and not agree that they should be abusive relationships for money?", "It's common for step-parents to make up reasons to emotionally and physically abuse their stepchildren to drive them out of the house so that they don't have to support them.", "NTA. I\u2019m worried about your nephew being verbally and possibly physically abused. That\u2019s not love. When he goes no contact with your sister, I hope she\u2019s not surprised.", "NTA. Brother Craig, though, needs to know is behavior around tha boy is being very closely monitored. Craig is DANGEROUS. Abusers can ALWAYS escalate to family elimination if they don\u2019t get their way.", "Nothing worth then a woman that sells out her child for man. Pathetic. She\u2019s allowing him to abuse her child.", "NTA. I hate people who put their stupid sex lives ahead of their children.", "I\u2019m tired of reading about people throwing away their children for horrible abusive partners. NTA", "Does your nephew braid his leg hair? If so, yeah, he\u2019s not qualified to be a lifeguard \n\n[what are the odds?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dqyld/aita_for_making_my_special_needs_coworker_cry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", ">\u201cwe haven\u2019t even eaten yet and Craig\u2019s gonna yell at me for wasting his time\u2026 please don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d \n\nYour sister needs help as well as your nephew. NTA. I wouldn't sit through the dinner either", "Your brother may need to be ready to both confront Craig and involve the authorities.", "And a safety deposit box", "NTA, you're smart for getting your children away from him too, if I were you I'd do my best to make sure your nephew got the lifeguard job, since his step-dad is set on making sure he doesn't get it cuz he 'isn't good enough for it', it would probably help him alot if other people in his life fought for him where the ones who should have didn't", "NTA.  Craig is abusive and your sister is letting him abuse her son which is just...well I hope that your nephew is with safe people who won't demean him for being a daydreamer.\n\nSigned, a woman who was called stupid, lacked common sense, and day dreamed all the time who is now an software engineer and flipping off Craig.  Tough love didn't do crap but give me some severe anger issues and imposter syndrome.", "NTA. Thank you, as one of many kids whose home environment got exchanged for the self-worth of some asshole whose only positive quality is their wallet. You don't even know... the sheer, unholy rage this digs up from my memories. She's his mother, and this is all she has to offer anymore. My mom's boyfriend had the decency to do it when no guests were around. This guy? This guy is somehow beyond even that. OP, if you can, get that kid a different guardian or something. Once your parent is willing to give up your home for their convenience, they aren't trustworthy anymore. That kid could be planning to cut ties and I wouldn't blame them.", "NTA, let us know what happens", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re an ally for your nephew. It\u2019s a shame he has three deadbeat parents", "That literally means nothing.  It doesn't mean he's stupid or weak. Some daydreamers are the richest ppl on the planet. \n\nHe's also just a teenager! Why do ppl think that teenagers have to have their act together and future plotted out before they graduate.\n\nIm glad he has someone in his life like you that won't back down from Craig. Make sure he knows that hes valued, loved, and capable of great things if that's what he wants.", "I (38F) was that daydreamer in class although I had managed to keep good grades until entering high school, it took over 25 years and Covid lockdowns for me to get diagnosed with inattentive ADHD.", "Neither ADHD nor Autism are mental health disorders. They\u2019re neurological disorders.", "Yes, I know. That's why I said ADD or autism OR a mental health problem.\n\nLike saying \" apples or pears or sandwiches\".", "You\u2019re absolutely NOT the AH, i\u2019m 100% standing up for my nephew. This made me so angry.(,: Poor guy is being treated to poorly & his mom is allowing it."]}
