His dad\u2019s a deadbeat. \n\nAnyways, sister married Craig a year ago. He\u2019s the type that thinks anyone that\u2019s uneducated or \u201cdumb\u201d is worthless and he clearly thinks my nephew is one of them because his grades aren\u2019t ideal and he\u2019s a bit of a daydreamer. \n\nWell they invited my family to dinner and it was bad. \n\nMy nephew told us all he got a job as a lifeguard a couple minutes in. His step dad was surprised. \n\nBut instead of congratulating him this man said \u201cwhen I said get a job I figured McDonald\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really qualified to be a lifeguard\u2026 whoever hired you is an idiot. Is it that place? For everyone\u2019s safety, I think I need to give them a call.\u201d \n\nMy nephew went fuck you and left the house. Craig laughed and said \u201che needs to hear this\u2026 thank god I\u2019m here aye the boy needed a father figure like me he\u2019s been coddled by women all his life.\u201d \n\nY\u2019all I was in SHOCK!!! Like I could not believe my ears. My husband had to step out because he was starting to laugh.\n\nI asked him if he was being serious and he was all like \u201cI\u2019m being serious, that boy is a damn airhead because he\u2019s never had a father in his life. Tough love is what we do best, that\u2019s why sons need two parents. Dads to toughen their boys up and moms to coddle them after. You throw off that balance and you get a boy acting like a dumb blonde girl\u2014like my step son.\u201d \n\nI just grabbed my girls and left. My sister chased after us and was all like \u201cwe haven\u2019t even eaten yet and Craig\u2019s gonna yell at me for wasting his time\u2026 please don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d \n\nI told her I was sorry but unlike her, I have self respect and won\u2019t sit there listening to his bullshit. Maybe she can, hell maybe she agrees but that is HER problem and I am NOT making it mine.\n\nShe started to cry and said I was taking it way too far. I don\u2019t have to like Craig but some respect would be nice. Besides, it\u2019s not like Craig was saying anything to me, and he has a point about tough love. \u201cyou know I love my son but c\u2019mon it\u2019s true he isn\u2019t the brightest, Craig\u2019s just trying to help in his own way.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at her and told her that I\u2019m glad Craig\u2019s money makes her so happy that she\u2019s willing to lose her fucking mind. She just started crying again and called me a bitch. My husband had to drag me to the car.\n\nHe told me that I was being a bit harsh. My daughters even said that I should calm down. When we got home, my mom called me and said to please give my sister a break because yeah he\u2019s a dick but at least he can provide for her unlike the other men she\u2019s dated/married. Apparently this is the best they all think she\u2019s going to get and I\u2019m ruining it for her. I\u2019m also failing to put myself in her shoes. I\u2019m just pissed off.
