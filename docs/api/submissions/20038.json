His dad\u2019s a deadbeat. \n\nAnyways, sister married Craig a year ago. He\u2019s the type that thinks anyone that\u2019s uneducated or \u201cdumb\u201d is worthless and he clearly thinks my nephew is one of them because his grades aren\u2019t ideal and he\u2019s a bit of a daydreamer. \n\nWell they invited my family to dinner and it was bad. \n\nMy nephew told us all he got a job as a lifeguard a couple minutes in. His step dad was surprised. \n\nBut instead of congratulating him this man said \u201cwhen I said get a job I figured McDonald\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really qualified to be a lifeguard\u2026 whoever hired you is an idiot. Is it that place? For everyone\u2019s safety, I think I need to give them a call.\u201d \n\nMy nephew went fuck you and left the house. Craig laughed and said \u201che needs to hear this\u2026 thank god I\u2019m here aye the boy needed a father figure like me he\u2019s been coddled by women all his life.\u201d \n\nY\u2019all I was in SHOCK!!! Like I could not believe my ears. My husband had to step out because he was starting to laugh.\n\nI asked him if he was being serious and he was all like \u201cI\u2019m being serious, that boy is a damn airhead because he\u2019s never had a father in his life. Tough love is what we do best, that\u2019s why sons need two parents. Dads to toughen their boys up and moms to coddle them after. You throw off that balance and you get a boy acting like a dumb blonde girl\u2014like my step son.\u201d \n\nI just grabbed my girls and left. My sister chased after us and was all like \u201cwe haven\u2019t even eaten yet and Craig\u2019s gonna yell at me for wasting his time\u2026 please don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d \n\nI told her I was sorry but unlike her, I have self respect and won\u2019t sit there listening to his bullshit. Maybe she can, hell maybe she agrees but that is HER problem and I am NOT making it mine.\n\nShe started to cry and said I was taking it way too far. I don\u2019t have to like Craig but some respect would be nice. Besides, it\u2019s not like Craig was saying anything to me, and he has a point about tough love. \u201cyou know I love my son but c\u2019mon it\u2019s true he isn\u2019t the brightest, Craig\u2019s just trying to help in his own way.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at her and told her that I\u2019m glad Craig\u2019s money makes her so happy that she\u2019s willing to lose her fucking mind. She just started crying again and called me a bitch. My husband had to drag me to the car.\n\nHe told me that I was being a bit harsh. My daughters even said that I should calm down. When we got home, my mom called me and said to please give my sister a break because yeah he\u2019s a dick but at least he can provide for her unlike the other men she\u2019s dated/married. Apparently this is the best they all think she\u2019s going to get and I\u2019m ruining it for her. I\u2019m also failing to put myself in her shoes. I\u2019m just pissed off.

Poor kid.", "So she\u2019s willing to lose a relationship with her son over some dick? Yeah that\u2019s a no for me. Giving him the time of day is just enabling him. Your sister needs to wake up because when her son turns 18, he\u2019ll be out the door and won\u2019t look back. She\u2019ll be stuck in an unhappy marriage. You\u2019re looking out for your nephew, which she clearly hasn\u2019t. She\u2019s an adult letting another adult tear her own child down. Is that really the environment she wants for her son?

Your poor nephew\u2026", "NTA and your sister should be ashamed bringing a man like that around her son. Abusing a child to toughen them up? That\u2019s disgusting and is only going to cause long term harm for your poor nephew.

There are no circumstances under which Craig would ever get to spend time with my kids if he was married to my sister.\n\nIt also seems likely that he is abusive towards your sister - begging you to stay for dinner because she's scared of how Craig will respond is a big red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Reading this was appalling, and I\u2019m so sorry for your nephew. I also worry for your sister and whether or not she\u2019s safe and healthy with Craig. I worry for your nephew as well, as Craig isn\u2019t encouraging him at all, he\u2019s only tearing him down. Keep your family safe. It\u2019s not right for your mom to ask you to apologize for standing up for your nephew either. Hope to hear an update soon and I hope you and yours stay safe. You did the right thing by protecting your children from him.", "NTA.\n\nkeep showing support for your nephew. since it seems like his parents are doing the opposite. \n\ndefending someone who finds humor in degrading your CHILD is gross behavior.", "NTA - Honestly people with attitudes like Craig's really screw kids up. Maybe he's a great husband to your sister but I am betting he's just way better in comparison to your nephew's father. He certainly isn't the kid of person I would want parenting. \n\nHe said he is actually going out of his way to sabotage someone's job. That's awful in itself especially when its based on his own perception of someone - not hard facts. Heck I know quite a few people who were daydreamers as students (especially high school) but were diligent at their jobs. \n\nI'm not even getting into his bizzare ideas about what fathers and mothers are like. \n\nOnce again NTA and make sure you are there for your nephew because he might be needing another place to live sooner than later.", "Im so glad your nephew has you in his corner.", "Craig is emotionally abusing your nephew.  I very much hope that there's another relative (you, your mother, anyone who isn't verbally sadistic in the name of tough love) who can take him in because having his mother sit there and say nothing while Craig verbally abuses him is going to destroy him).\n\nYour sister's behavior is unconscionable.  \n\nWhy on earth would you want to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's complicit in child abuse.\n\nNTA", " NTA You need to hold on to your sanity for dear life because every other adult mentioned has lost their damned mind!!! A man can purchase the right to abuse your nephew? Wtf?", "NTA but is you sister a victim of domestic abuse? does she need help to escape? if she is willing to let her child be bullied and is worried her husband will be angry that is not a good sign.", "NTA. But why did your husband step out because he was starting to laugh? Was it because he found the situation hilarious? Or that he found the treatment of his nephew hilarious?", "\u201cI don\u2019t have to like Craig but some respect would be nice\u201d \n\nRespect like telling you that woman can only raise airheads? Respect like calling blond women dumb? Respect like calling people dumb if they are not \u201ceducated\u201d to his standards? Respect like threats to call someone\u2019s employer and getting them fired? Respect like yelling at his spouse when he\u2019s the one causing the issue? Respect like laughing at a 16yo for getting a job? \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Craig was saying anything to me\u201d\n\nOh, but he was! He was laughing in your face and basically calling you and your daughters airheads, like all females. Apart from disrespecting your nephew, that is. \n\nAnd, since (per your comment) your nephew spends almost every day at your home (that is; in the presence of a *man*!), he actually disrespected your husband as well.

He knows your sister won't stop him, so he picks on the kid as a way to feel better about his own insecurities.
