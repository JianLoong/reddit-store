He\u2019s the type that thinks anyone that\u2019s uneducated or \u201cdumb\u201d is worthless and he clearly thinks my nephew is one of them because his grades aren\u2019t ideal and he\u2019s a bit of a daydreamer. \n\nWell they invited my family to dinner and it was bad. \n\nMy nephew told us all he got a job as a lifeguard a couple minutes in.

Is it that place? For everyone\u2019s safety, I think I need to give them a call.\u201d \n\nMy nephew went fuck you and left the house. Craig laughed and said \u201che needs to hear this\u2026 thank god I\u2019m here aye the boy needed a father figure like me he\u2019s been coddled by women all his life.\u201d \n\nY\u2019all I was in SHOCK!!! Like I could not believe my ears. My husband had to step out because he was starting to laugh.\n\nI asked him if he was being serious and he was all like \u201cI\u2019m being serious, that boy is a damn airhead because he\u2019s never had a father in his life. Tough love is what we do best, that\u2019s why sons need two parents. Dads to toughen their boys up and moms to coddle them after. You throw off that balance and you get a boy acting like a dumb blonde girl\u2014like my step son.\u201d \n\nI just grabbed my girls and left. My sister chased after us and was all like \u201cwe haven\u2019t even eaten yet and Craig\u2019s gonna yell at me for wasting his time\u2026 please don\u2019t leave yet.\u201d \n\nI told her I was sorry but unlike her, I have self respect and won\u2019t sit there listening to his bullshit. Maybe she can, hell maybe she agrees but that is HER problem and I am NOT making it mine.\n\nShe started to cry and said I was taking it way too far. I don\u2019t have to like Craig but some respect would be nice. Besides, it\u2019s not like Craig was saying anything to me, and he has a point about tough love. \u201cyou know I love my son but c\u2019mon it\u2019s true he isn\u2019t the brightest, Craig\u2019s just trying to help in his own way.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at her and told her that I\u2019m glad Craig\u2019s money makes her so happy that she\u2019s willing to lose her fucking mind. She just started crying again and called me a bitch. My husband had to drag me to the car.\n\nHe told me that I was being a bit harsh. My daughters even said that I should calm down. When we got home, my mom called me and said to please give my sister a break because yeah he\u2019s a dick but at least he can provide for her unlike the other men she\u2019s dated/married. Apparently this is the best they all think she\u2019s going to get and I\u2019m ruining it for her. I\u2019m also failing to put myself in her shoes. I\u2019m just pissed off.

Your sister is selling her son down the river.

Which made me susceptible in believing what they were saying. There was this consensus that she couldn\u2019t learn how to drive etc. I have so many regrets in even thinking like them (luckily I never laughed or made my own jokes). I\u2019m sure had she worked as a lifeguard they would have made the same jokes and I might have thought the same thing. \nShe has a master in philosophy and is an excellent teacher and is loved by all her students! She is one of the smartest people I know and thinks before giving amazing insides! \n\nIt\u2019s sad how dreamers are made to feel less. They don\u2019t follow the conventional rules about constantly being with friends, social media, sports, etc. I think they intimidate people who need others to feel validated. Your nephew doesn\u2019t need his stepfather and he can\u2019t handle not being the big man of the house. So he is going to do what my stepfamily did to my sister when it became clear after a few meetings that my sister wasn\u2019t just going to go along with their program.\n\nEdit: just want to add, I\u2019m very happy and touched that you support your nephew and see how great he is. I saw my sister as my role mode (when I was young) and yet on this I judged her harshly. Still very ashamed of this! NTA", "We need day dreamers. We need creative, imaginative, compassionate people. The world has enough abusive bullies. If you can OP please see about temporary custody of your newphew. \n\n\nAlso, listen to what your sister is saying. She was scared of getting yelled at for wasting her husbands time. Please remind her that you are always there for her. You love her. You love your nephew. Abusers isolate their victims from friends and family. Craig is already driving a wedge between your sister and her family. If this is how he speaks about his nephew in public, imagine how he talks to both of them in private. Keep the door open. One day when she opens her eyes your sister will need your help to escape.", "Has he been tested for ADD? I say because I grew up struggling with focus, and the same was said of me. \"Daydreamer\" \"airhead\" \"you need to work harder\"... I still have trauma around those kinds of phrases because I heard it most of my childhood. When you're told that you're an idiot enough times by people in a position of authority, you start to believe it. \n\nI was your nephew's age when my mom took me to therapy and my therapist suggested an ADD assessment. I was diagnosed and given meds and cognitive therapy, and I went from the bottom quarter of my class to 45th. I'm not saying he has ADD, but even without that therapy could help (so long as he has one who specializes in adolescents with focus issues.) \n\nOf course, fucking CRAIG may try to run interference. Rules of the sub mean I can't give advice on what to do because he reminds me of every teacher I ever had who insulted my intelligence during parent-teacher conferences with me sitting right there. \ud83e\udd2c", "I hope someday you'll join us......", "I hope someday he'll join us.", "Thank you.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/Activexpend2d is a scammer!  **It is stealing comments** to farm karma in an effort to \"legitimize\" its account for engaging in scams and spam elsewhere.
