He left behind my niece, Megan, and his wife, \"Tina\". He left her owing $25,000 on a $375,000 home, no credit card debt and about $25,000 in savings. With her job as a bus driver, she would have been able to keep her house and continue to raise her high-functioning autistic daughter. I helped quite a bit when he died - I flew to TX from Indiana and helped her clean the house (they lived like pigs) and get all her finances in order so she could move forward. \n\nI have had a good relationship with my SIL, which has not been easy. While not intellectually disabled, she likely is very close.  For this reason, I made sure she didn't have to do much of anything (all bills paid automatically, etc.). When I returned home, I called her once a week to check on her and a few months ago, she admitted she fell for one of those gift card scams and lost not only the $25,000, but also, charged her credit cards $20,000. I advised her what to do: pay your mortgage and nothing else - I will help you deal with the creditors. She did not take my advice and stopped answering calls or texts.  After a few weeks, she called me because they had no food. I immediately bought them food by going on-line and ordering it and she picked it up. I have done this 5 times in the past 6 months. I also bought her daughter all her school clothes in August.  I told her that I would continue to help, but that she needed to listen to me so something like this would not happen again.\n\nJump to January of this year - she posts on FB that she and Megan are moving into an apartment as she has sold the house. She wouldn't answer the phone, but in text messages, said that she didn't want to live there because of the memories and that she was getting $160,000 for the house. I asked why so little, but she did not respond. I told her in a text that she needed to carefully think about this as the apartment was $2500 a month whereas her mortgage was only $450, but there was no reasoning or talking to her.\n\nI just found out that she is about to be evicted and the $160,000? No idea where it went as she will not tell me. My guess is she got scammed again, or there never was a sale and the house was foreclosed. She sent me a text yesterday asking me to pay her rent and get her groceries. I bought her groceries, but will not pay her rent.  I have health issues myself and am a single woman who has no one to rely on by myself. That said, I feel like IATA for not helping her more given her poor life skills, as there is no one else for her to turn to - everyone has passed away in her family and mine.  I've suggested so many things to help, but she does none of them. Now, an almost 17-year old girl, my niece, is about to be homeless.

You\u2019ve tried to help her several times and she refuses your advice and guidance. She clearly only considers \u201cgive me money and buy me food\u201d to be the only thing she\u2019s expecting from you, which is not acceptable.\n\nI believe you can intervene and contact an agency (perhaps CPS can help guide you in the right direction). It\u2019s clear that your SIL is suffering from a mental disability and can no longer care for herself or her daughter without some intervention. Try contacting the department of health and human services in her city govt or whatever is comparable to that.", "NTA - First lesson of being a lifeguard is \"Don't Drown.\"   You have a person who is drowning and grasping onto your help to save them.  Unfortunately, she can pull you under.  You can't help those who won't accept it.  In retrospect, it is sad that you brother did not form some sort of trust to protect her and his daughter.", "NTA - you can lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink.  You did everything you possibly could to help your SIL, and she took your handouts but not your advice.  At this point, there really isn't anything more you reasonably can do.  \n\nBe gentle to yourself, you've done the best you could to help someone who won't help themself.", "I have nothing for you on this.  You cannot save people from themselves.  You will be throwing money down into a black hole if you subsidize her and her daughter.\n\nThe only option that I can think of to help your niece is to have her live with you until she becomes an adult and live on her own.  I don't think having your SIL stay with you as a good thing.  However I would really hesitate to do this option.", "NTA, it sounds like she needs help though, that she\u2019s just capable, very sad", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncut her off. she is just causing stress as she is not even trying to do well.", "NTA  Not by a long shot.\n\nYou've done more than most ever would.  Your SIL, whether stubborn or just low functioning, has made too many poor decisions for you to continue throwing money at.", "NTA- this sucks on a lot of levels. But you are not obligated to care for someone who placed themselves into a bad situation. Plus- you have to get the oxygen mask on yourself you know. Not that I don't feel sad and empathy for your family... stinks", "NTA\n\nYou tried all that you could to help. You can\u2019t drown yourself to save her.", "NTA, but social services should've been called a loooooooong time ago. That poor kid. You've enabled this to go on way too long.", "NTA. Sadly, this is the only way Tina will learn. She hasn't had to be responsible with her money because you were always there to make the problems go away. The only thing you can do now is let her bear the weight of her own bad decisions.", "NTA, if you want help them, you may try to set up your SIL with some organizations that helps disabled people. You say your niece is autistic, it is very possible that your SIL is autistic too, autism is highly hereditary disability. She needs some serious help, but it is not your lace to be their only means of providing.", "NTA. SIL is too dumb to help. I would take in the niece but leave the SIL to fend for herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for your perspective.", "That is excellent advice. Thank you.", "Thank you for your thoughts. I am furious with him for not doing that. He told me he had and it was a lie. Just terrible.", "That is very kind of you - thank you.", "Yes, it is something I am carefully considering. Thank you.", "Indeed. It is tragic.", "Yes that seems to be the concensus. I am grateful for the help from wonderful strangers. Thank you.", "Thank you for taking the time to comment. I appreciate it, and your point of view, very much.", "Thank you - I know that but I am fighting myself on it - judging myself. That a family member of mine, and a minor one at that is going to be homeless, is tearing me into 1 million small pieces. I appreciate you taking the time to help me.", "Yes I suppose that\u2019s so obvious - not sure why I need to be told that but I do.

I am older and have family in different situations... I wish I could do more. But you have to set a limit and boundaries. It feels wrong though.... the worst. I just remind myself that I am not obligated to help nor responsible for someone else. I'll help if I can and there is always someone else out there they can ask for help. Or some organization. It's not only me that can help", "Sometimes we just need permission to do what we know is right for ourselves. We feel selfish thinking \"just one more thing\", but that one more thing is really burying the other person AND you.\n\nTime to separate yourself from it all before you can't dig yourself out. Right now you are looking at the edge with a shovel in your hand. Time to toss the shovel.\n\nIf you are worried about your niece, I would contact services in her state for those who are high functioning autistic. There are organizations that can help her and get her setup for work training and group homes. Even if she has to be in the foster system for a little bit (hopefully not long) these things can be waiting for her to give her a leg up on the other side.", "Oh your words are so wise and I hear them!! Loud and clear! I sooo needed to hear this and am grateful you took the time. Thank you!", "Oh my heavens what a wonderful, thoughtful suggestion! I am going to research exactly that immediately. I am grateful to you!!", "Happy to help!"]}
