I told her he has a car and if he was cold this winter I'd set it on fire to help keep him warm. \n\nTo understand the situation a bit of back sorry it's needed. My older brother and I have rarely gotten along. We lived together when I came home from the AF until he tried to get rid of my cats after a fight. He locked his animals in his room, opened every door to the house in winter and let my cats just wonder out and they are indoor cats. Luckily i found them and after a fist fight a moved out.\n\nTime goes on and I get a job at the complex he lives at. Because I work where he lives, he thinks he can call me at any time if the day or night to fix what ever issue he has because I'm his brother and the maintenance supervisors. His buildings hot water went out at 11 pm one Friday night. I had my maintenance crew working on it they had to wait to get parts in the morning. He goes on to wake me up at 3am on a Saturday to complain. I explained the problem and it would be fixed asap Saturday after 8am. That wasn't good enough so he sent emails to corporate trying to get me fired, then threatened to call CPS to get my children taken away if I didn't fix his issue right now.\n\nThat was my final straw. I let him know in no uncertain terms he was no longer my family and would be a stranger to me and my children for the rest of his life.\n\nWhich brings us to the past 6 months. He shows up to his job at an old folks home drunk and gets fired. Refuses to get a new job and stays home drinking.\n\nHe hasn't paid his bills in 5 months and is set to be evicted. So he started reaching out to family for help and when help is offered with conditions like get sober, get a job and pay the money back he started screaming and texting horrible things to everyone. He is 45 and throws tantrums like a child. Because of his actions the entire family has gone no contact and blocked him everywhere.\n\nHe finally turned to me and asked if he could stay with me and my kids. After everything he's done to me and threatened those same children to get them taken away, he expects me to let him in. I told him if I ever saw him again I would give him the find out portion of his f-around actions, but also said if he was cold on the streets he can call me and if set his car on fire to help him stay warm.

Some people might find your last message to him a tad hard, but I get it. You have had enough and there is not a shadow of a chance that he could stay with you. He is in a hot mess. He needs to understand that unless he takes serious steps to get his sh*t together, nobody at all is going to lift a finger to help him.", "NTA - I think getting sober and a job is the condition to move in with someone in the family, and even then if he misbehaves, he has to go.

It's a death by paper cuts.  It's about burned bridges.  It's about mental illness mixed with substance abuse mixed with a tornado of other problems.\n\nYou have to protect your mental health and your children.  This means your brother is on his own.
