I told her he has a car and if he was cold this winter I'd set it on fire to help keep him warm. \n\nTo understand the situation a bit of back sorry it's needed. My older brother and I have rarely gotten along. We lived together when I came home from the AF until he tried to get rid of my cats after a fight. He locked his animals in his room, opened every door to the house in winter and let my cats just wonder out and they are indoor cats. Luckily i found them and after a fist fight a moved out.\n\nTime goes on and I get a job at the complex he lives at. Because I work where he lives, he thinks he can call me at any time if the day or night to fix what ever issue he has because I'm his brother and the maintenance supervisors. His buildings hot water went out at 11 pm one Friday night. I had my maintenance crew working on it they had to wait to get parts in the morning. He goes on to wake me up at 3am on a Saturday to complain. I explained the problem and it would be fixed asap Saturday after 8am. That wasn't good enough so he sent emails to corporate trying to get me fired, then threatened to call CPS to get my children taken away if I didn't fix his issue right now.\n\nThat was my final straw. I let him know in no uncertain terms he was no longer my family and would be a stranger to me and my children for the rest of his life.\n\nWhich brings us to the past 6 months. He shows up to his job at an old folks home drunk and gets fired. Refuses to get a new job and stays home drinking.\n\nHe hasn't paid his bills in 5 months and is set to be evicted. So he started reaching out to family for help and when help is offered with conditions like get sober, get a job and pay the money back he started screaming and texting horrible things to everyone. He is 45 and throws tantrums like a child. Because of his actions the entire family has gone no contact and blocked him everywhere.\n\nHe finally turned to me and asked if he could stay with me and my kids. After everything he's done to me and threatened those same children to get them taken away, he expects me to let him in. I told him if I ever saw him again I would give him the find out portion of his f-around actions, but also said if he was cold on the streets he can call me and if set his car on fire to help him stay warm.

Love your suggestion", "NTA Even if you did like him he probably needs to hit rock bottom.", "Thank you", "Logically, I know. Honestly. But there is always that part that questions. Ya know?", "NTA. He's burned bridges with you and refuses to accept fixing himself as a condition for having somewhere to live. Once he's dealing with lack of options he may be close enough to rock bottom to realise he needs to compromise to have security.", "NTA. It is alway okay to excise abusive and volatile people from your life, doubly so when there are children involved.", "Thank you for all your comments. This is also to address a few that have wondered why I've posted even though I know the answer. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. \n\nIn my head I know you're right that I've made the right decision. That said, I spent my life as the middle son who was always forced to accept any crap my older brother decided to give and they my younger brother would never suffer a punishment. I was forced to mine out at 16 or stay in an abusive house. My parents them let my them 21 year old brother move in and take my bedroom because he got his 2nd DUI and needed help getting around so while I lived in my car and surfing couches. My 16th-18th birthdays were forgotten but they would drop everything to save the first son.\n\nAfter going to the air force and coming home after my time, I thought things may have changed and he moved in with me to finally get it off or parents house. He was 27. We lived together for 2 years and in that time he slept with 3 of my GFS, stole from me and tried to get rid of my cats after the last fight she every time I was forced to forgive him by my parents. Now after 35 years of that BS I'm finally free as a 41 years old single dad of 3 and while my mom isn't trying to force me, the memories remain. So, yeah, intellectually I know I'm right but 3 decades of being forced to suffer his abuse and say thank you is kind of hard to turn off. There is obviously more than what I've listed, but I hope this sheds a bit of light on my motives seeking judgement.", "ESH. You certainly don't have to let him move in, but don't mock his situation to his face. Just say no, or don't accept the call.", "NTA hes 45bqnd responsible for his situation.", "NTA....", "NTA. However, it is generally accepted that it's not a recommended course of action to set the cars on fire to warm up the inhabitants...", "NTA. Do his kids have a place to live though? Their mom or other relatives? Kids are going to suffer because of his horrible behavior. And no, I absolutely would not let him back into your house.", "NTA -- Sounds like someone who needs to hit rock bottom before they'll clean up their own act.", "NTA. He should get an assessment for residential treatment.", "You're my hero! \n\nNTA", "Fuck that guy.  NTA.", "NTA but since he has previously tried to ruin your life, don\u2019t hand him any ammo by threatening to light his car on fire. IDK the legalities of verbal threats, but better safe than sorry. That said, I bet it felt good to tell him that, and imo you are justified.", "Nope, NTA.\n\nIf ever there was a case of someone \"making his own bed,\" this is it.", "I needed that chuckle. Thanks", "You have the soul of an angel and I wish you luck. You might try therapy to smooth things out, but you are under no obligation to contact him or your parents ever again.", "Nah fuck him", "Only because the fire might spread to things that are useful.", "Also, IF he had children, I would take them in and raise them with the same love and guidance I give my own. But I still wouldn't let him near my front door.", "He doesn't have kids. I do.", "I just hope that a bunch of internet strangers telling you that you're right is reassuring. Family is more than blood and marriage, it's the people who care about and consider you. That man isn't family. NTA.", "Please see general response below"]}
