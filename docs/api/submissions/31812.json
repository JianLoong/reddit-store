I had a really shitty day and there were some moments where I just wanted to quit. What kept me going is I knew I was going to see my girlfriend in a few hours.

However, I came home from work and my girlfriend knew I had a shitty day and put my favourite TV show on. We sat down and cuddled whilst I told her why work was shit. She started putting dinner on and told me to have a shower to help me relax. I had my shower and I was relaxed. I stood in the kitchen seeing her cook and I was thinking how lucky I am so I blurted out \"marry me\".\n\nShe shrieked and jumped up and down in excitement and asked if I was being serious.

Your fiance is 33 and you don't need to ask permission to marry her -- what century do they think this is? And the proposal had been spur of the moment, something you knew you wanted to do, and it slipped out of your mouth when you were feeling loved. She asked if you were serious, and you were, because you'd been thinking of doing it but it just happened. But you didn't want to take it back. And you two could have in theory decided to wait and do an actual official proposal with a ring, but it sounds like she was too excited to not spread the news. Thats great! She cares more about marrying you than about getting a ring -- that's how it should be. Now you can go shopping together and get rings.", "My fiance insisted that she felt no need for an engagement ring. We were poor as church mice, I was still an undergraduate.\nI scraped money together, saved and gave her a diamond ring on our tenth anniversary.\nWe have celebrated more than thirty since.

Take a break from her parents until you have the ring and have celebrated more 'formally'.", "NTA, Asking for parents blessing is so outdated, and rings also only matter as much as they matter to you.

I feel like most people, or at least most people I know, pick out the ring either together, or with some guidance from their partner.

But they are asshole-ish for making such a big deal out of it.", "You\u2019re not as much as an asshole as much as you are an idiot.", "You are indeed a bit of an asshole but if your fianc\u00e9 is fine with it then so be it.

It's not like you not gonna buy it at all. I'm surprised your fiance don't get that as you wrote she's a little upset too and only her parents. Also asking parents for permission to marry is ridiculous and outdated. They should get over themselfs.", "NTA\n\nCongrats to both of you.", "NTA - plan a special afternoon to choose a ring together. Make is fun and sentimental. \n\nThe proposal and the ring and the wedding are just window dressing. The goal is a happy marriage.", "Tell her you wanted to pick one out with her, but you realized at that moment how .uch she meant and you couldn't wait anymore to ask.

It is a matter of personal choice and circumstance.\r  \n\r  \nConsider this: in your case, you had an incredibly tough day at work, and your emotions got the best of you. You were overwhelmed by a surge of love and appreciation for your girlfriend, leading you to make an impromptu proposal. The absence of a ring in that moment does not diminish the sincerity and depth of your feelings, nor the significance of the commitment you were expressing.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, the idea that seeking parental blessing and having a ring are prerequisites for a valid proposal is a cultural norm, but not an objective requirement. Society has evolved, and there are countless examples of successful and loving marriages that did not adhere strictly to these conventions.\r  \n\r  \nNow, let's consider the reactions of your girlfriend and her parents. Despite her initial disappointment, your fianc\u00e9e expressed her happiness about the engagement. This indicates that she values the emotional connection and commitment you shared in that moment, rather than placing sole importance on material symbols.\r  \n\r  \nAs for her parents, it's understandable that they may hold traditional views on proposals. However, it is crucial to recognize that their reaction is based on their personal expectations, which may not necessarily align with your own values or circumstances. It's important to communicate openly with them, expressing your genuine intentions and the depth of your love for their daughter.\r  \n\r  \nSo, my dear interlocutor, it seems that you are not the \"asshole\" in this situation. Instead, you are a person who acted spontaneously out of love and appreciation, and while the absence of a ring may have disappointed some, it does not invalidate the significance of your proposal.", "I hate drama. Hate watching dramas. People crying around me makes me physically uncomfortable. \n\nBut you describing yourself, that was art and was beautiful. \n\nHer honesty with love, and your acceptance and not skipping a beat, I hope is something you\u2019ll always remember. SS this post.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband asked me to marry him, unplanned, ringless, on his knee in our apartment bathroom, after coming home from accomplishing a huge life goal. Easiest yes of my life. He was worried my dad would be bummed he didn\u2019t talk to him first (I knew he wouldn\u2019t be) and my dad was thrilled his daughter had a man that loved her the way he does and followed his heart. Got a bodacious ring 9 months later and still happy as a clam 14 years later. \n\nGood on you for following your heart. \n\nYour future in-laws suck so be weary of that as you move forward. Your girl sounds chill enough; sounds like she just wants a ring for the symbolism of being engaged to you.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. It\u2019s normal for a couple to choose a ring together and you certainly don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to be asking to marry someone, if you are both happy then great and don\u2019t let anyone ruin that for you!

Your GF (fianc\u00e9!) isn't her dad's property to give away.\n\nI'd still work towards a cordial way of cooling things down with the in-laws, only to make sure nothing is awkward (AKA don't go messaging \"she's not your property to give blessings for\" etc even if it's true) but that's only if your partner wants to keep a relationship with them. They're gonna be in your life for a long time, so even if they are in the wrong, try to be civil (but no need to go out of your way apologizing and stuff.

And, to be honest, this is the way all proposals should be done.", "NTA. The best proposals come straight from the heart when the time is right. Once she accepts, you can go ring shopping together (in my opinion, the best way to do it anyway.

Her parents were not happy for us, LDR stuff was partly the reason, but it was still sad for both of us.", "I did the same thing. When you\u2019re in love, it\u2019s natural to do impulsive acts. In my case, I remembered Mercedes had sent me a mood ring so I could see if I were in the \u201cmood\u201d to get a new one. I gave it to her, and we went out looking for an engagement ring the next weekend. Twenty five years later it\u2019s still in her jewelry box.
