If she didn't know who was guilty she slapped both of us.", "NTA. Solved the issue right? What happens if they pull that shit in high school? (We had kids do that in high school with friends)", "Exactly this.\nPretty neat way to call them out on their little game without accusing them of anything but even teaching them a lesson with an age appropriate punishment.", "Agreed.\n\nThis seems impossible that the parents are unable to tell their own 10 year old twin children apart, identical or not. I\u2019ve never met anyone with identical twins that can\u2019t easily tell them apart. Yes, they are incredibly similar looking and can fool those that don\u2019t know them well, but close family and especially parents know them by heart. There are more than 1 set of identical twins in my family and parents always can tell them apart?", "Absolutely. They need to keep on top of academics so they don't struggle when they go back to school. They have they time and it's not cheap.", "Actually most parents can by subtle differences or personalities. My boys dress, act, talk and look the same. I guess I could tell them a part because one boy has a mole on his butt cheek and the other doesn't. \n\nI'm sure that will change when they hit puberty. Plus 10yo boys are really good liars.", "YTA. I agree with your wife. Also, by the way, you've had twin boys for 10 years now: You need to figure out a way to be able to tell them apart.", "NTA abs boss level parenting. It's a gentle FAFO that's only going to get worse if you don't check them now", "NTA and thank you for teaching your kids this lesson!", "Genius\u2026my husband is a twin and he and his brother used to do it all the time and they would get caught. They both got punished and back in the day the punishments were harder(he\u2019s 65 and he says all twins do this until they get caught) us normal folk have to live without this advantag.", "NTA - but I'd call it self defense!!! LOL", "This is actually hilarious.. I think they\u2019ll look back fondly and laugh", "\u201cEntrapment\u201d is prompting someone to take a bad action they would not have taken otherwise, and then punishing them for it. \n\nYou are catching your kids in the act and punishing them for it. It\u2019s not entrapment. They\u2019re just learning about the \u201cfind out\u201d that comes after \u201cfuck around.\u201d", "Entrapment is a legal term, not a parenting one. It was an important lesson, one worth learning now! NTA", "NTA and your wife doesn't understand the term entrapment. That is when you lure someone into doing something. You just chose the time to act on their behavior. More like lying in wait. Why shouldn't you choose when to discipline your kids or not?", "How else could you be sure though? I\u2019d calmly discuss with the boys what happened and why it was fair. Then I\u2019d ask them how to ensure they act with integrity and don\u2019t abuse their twinness. You know, within reason.", "That's not entrapment, entrapment is when a person in a position go authority convinces someone to commit a crime they weren't already planning to commit, all you did was use their own bullshit against them and they realised and stopped, it was a valuable lesson for them. Arguably one your wove weeds to learn too by the sounds of things of she thinks letting them walk all over both of you is going to go down well", "In this specific scenario NTA.", "NTA", "YTA. Didn't you lie by pretending to don't know that they were pretending to be each other? Are you grounded?\n\nThis was a childish and harmless prank. Why the strong reaction? And who uses grounding as a punishment anymore?", "Fred and George Weasley did it all the time, and Arthur&Molly were freakin' MAGICAL! What chance do us mere muggles have?!", "Best comment!!", "NTA. Well done, this is a BRILLIANT teaching method. There should be more parents like you that actually teach their children that actions have consequences.", "It\u2019s funny. Maybe wait a couple of days and take them out for ice cream.", "NTA\n\nTell your wife that cops don't have to tell you if they are a cop. \nIt's your job to teach them how life lessons in a safe/low stakes environment now, so that they are capable of making better choices when they are older and the stakes are higher.", "Well, I think it's GENIUS! NTA", "yeah its not entrapment either. Entrapment would be going up to the kid and selling them weed in a disguise and then grounding them for it and taking their weed later and grounding them like that one mom did", "You would be surprised, my mom and dad often had no fucking clue which was which until a few minutes in when we were kids. Their own fault really given they bought us the exact same clothes, exact same shoes, exact same haircuts. Did start to become more easier for them as we aged to puberty and started differentiating ourselves more.", "YTA simply by no being able to tell apart your twins when they are TEN years old. Are you blind and deaf?\n\nI know identical twins, and they say most people can tell them apart after just a few interactions. Their family can tell them apart by their footsteps or breathing. There is absolutely zero excuse for you to consistently mix them up when they are ten years old.", "NTA what you did was funny as fuck", "NTA. Identity theft is not a joke!!", "NTA\n\nBut I have never encountered identical twins where the immediate family couldn't tell them apart. At least not once they're past the baby stage. Generally, to immediate family, the twins look quite different.\n\nIs your wife also unable to tell the twins apart? Because if she can tell the twins apart and you cannot after 10 years, there's something really wrong.", "NTA. Kids are all unique situations that need unique solutions. Good on you for finding a way.", "Your wife needs to get a grip. \"Entrapment\". By that logic, her pwecious wickle babies were committing fraud. You nipped this in the bud before it got to something either serious or dangerous.\n\nNTA and if I ever end up with twins, I'm remembering this.", "I think it\u2019s genius. NTA", "N t a also give them different haircuts......", "NTA\n\n\"Therefore I can't punish both for one kid's wrongdoing\"  and yes you can.  they are both deceiving you", "This person is absolutely the AH. What parent can't tell apart their children at ten years old? The kids are probably annoyed and playing a harmless prank in response.", "\"I can't instantly tell twins apart, so obviously parents can't tell their children apart either\" - the non-twin down voters.", "Do you have twins ?   \n\nThey are sometimes impossible to tell apart.", "1. Face Blindness is a thing, and it comes in different difficulty levels.\n2. Twins is hard mode.\n3. Teons that actively try to deceive you are ultra hard mode.", "I'm sorry what", "And the only Chinese character in the books was named Cho Chang.
