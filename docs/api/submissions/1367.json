{"id": 1367, "submission_id": "ymcd4a", "title": "AITA for refusing to ask my grandparents to change the menu?", "selftext": "My grandparents have been hosting Thanksgiving for a long time. They are very particular about every detail. Each dish is the same as every year prior, and they never change their recipes. All guests are allowed to bring is wine.\n\nI invited my girlfriend to Thanksgiving, and she said yes. Later, she asked me about the menu. I told her everything that would be served. She asked if a few dishes could be added or changed for her preference. She doesn't like turkey and would prefer ham, so she wants us to bring a honey baked ham to be served alongside the turkey. She also doesn't like green beans and would prefer another vegetable like broccoli or asparagus be served instead or alongside the green beans. She also hates cranberries and wants us to bring an additional side dish to make up for that.\n\nI asked if she was joking, and she asked why I would ask that. First of all, my grandparents wouldn't serve ham at their table, because pigs are filthy animals, so that's not going to happen. Second, it's a little rude to ask that someone replace a dish they are planning on making or make two separate dishes. Third, I could ask about bringing our own side, but my grandparents would probably be offended.\n\nMy girlfriend said they don't have to eat the ham, but other people might like it. If they have green beans every year a little variety might be exciting, and bringing and extra dish is a nice gesture of appreciation. I told her it wouldn't work and suggested maybe we go to her family's this year and mine next year. She said it was rude for me to invite myself to her family's thanksgiving and that it was ridiculous I wouldn't even ask for her accomodations.\n\nI said we should just do separate Thanksgivings and try a get together for Christmas. She still thinks I was an ass about the whole thing.

If they are a no pork family, then don't bring ham.
