Apparently one of his stims is spraying bottles. Like the cleaning kind. I didn\u2019t know this until this incident.\n\nOur setup for the garden area till is kind of a U- or C- shape. We have a cart with the till so it can be taken inside overnight, and two tables bolted together. One table has a shelf underneath where we keep various paper towels and cleaning stuff (including a bottle of diluted bleach), as well as bags for customers buying non-plant items, pots that customers have brought back for recycling, garden gloves for the employees, etc. Around the whole thing is a table skirt that\u2019s attached to the table. I really have no say in the set-up beyond moving things around on the shelf.\n\nAnyway, one day this mom brought her kid in. I saw him trying to reach AROUND the table legs to the cleaning supplies, so I moved them down the shelf closer to me and told him those bottles are for cleaning, not for touching and asked him to please leave them alone. Then I got started scanning his mom\u2019s stuff.\n\nOut of nowhere, a bunch of droplets hit my sunglasses and cheeks. I looked up and the kid had pulled the table skirt - which was zip-tied tightly to the table - away, stuck his arm through, grabbed the bottle of bleach, and started spraying it around.\n\nI quickly grabbed it from him as his mom laughed and reminded me he\u2019s autistic and said he has a spray bottle of water at home that he likes to spray people with.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I told her that first off, she shouldn\u2019t be encouraging him to spray people with ANYTHING without their consent, and second, that wasn\u2019t water, it was bleach, and they were both lucky I was wearing sunglasses because I could\u2019ve gone blind. She was really offended and again tried to tell me he was autistic. I said that may be an excuse for him to not realize, but she needs to be paying closer attention to her kid in public places if he\u2019s going to do stuff like that.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t brought her kid in since.

By her attitude it appears she is not even attempting to modify behavior", "NTA. You tried to correct him once w/o overstepping and at that point she should have been more mindful of him. He could have gotten hurt or hurt you.", "NTA you can judge harmful stims. They can be controlled or redirected in a lot of autistic people, and if they can't they have no business being in public potentially hurting people. Autism is not an excuse for being an asshole.

I would get playing with a spray bottle on his own as a stim, but not spraying other people with it.", "NTA. At home, that's fine. Do whatever you want, it's your problem what your child does. In public though, people are allowed to get upset that your kid is spraying them regardless of the reason that they're doing it.", "NTA. Mother needs to control her kid. Not make excuses.", "NTA.

The fact she laughed when he sprayed you really shows that she doesn't recognize that her son's actions are actually disruptive, and in this case dangerous. Not cute or funny. Even if it was just water, it's still not okay to spray someone. His mom obviously knows about this behavioral tendency, yet does nothing to try and prevent it. You did nothing wrong. Don't feel bad at all.

No idea about my kiddo yet!): Him having autism doesn\u2019t give him a pass for doing whatever he wants.

If that means he can carry his special bottle wherever, fine\u2014but he still has to learn that the spray can only be directed toward the ground, or whatever.\n\nAlso, the mom needs to learn how to help her son not reach a point where he *needs* to stim to calm down. \u201cHuh, he seems to get really overstimulated in environments where X, Y, and Z are present. I know all of those things will be at the garden department. Maybe I should talk with him about it beforehand, tell him what I know so he won\u2019t be surprised, and ask him what he thinks will help him deal with the situation, so he can bring that thing with him, or we\u2019ll know that he\u2019ll stay in this one particular area to wait, or whatever?\u201d\n\nThis is all to say, it\u2019s 100% on her.
