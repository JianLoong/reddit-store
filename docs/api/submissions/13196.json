Apparently one of his stims is spraying bottles. Like the cleaning kind. I didn\u2019t know this until this incident.\n\nOur setup for the garden area till is kind of a U- or C- shape. We have a cart with the till so it can be taken inside overnight, and two tables bolted together. One table has a shelf underneath where we keep various paper towels and cleaning stuff (including a bottle of diluted bleach), as well as bags for customers buying non-plant items, pots that customers have brought back for recycling, garden gloves for the employees, etc. Around the whole thing is a table skirt that\u2019s attached to the table. I really have no say in the set-up beyond moving things around on the shelf.\n\nAnyway, one day this mom brought her kid in. I saw him trying to reach AROUND the table legs to the cleaning supplies, so I moved them down the shelf closer to me and told him those bottles are for cleaning, not for touching and asked him to please leave them alone. Then I got started scanning his mom\u2019s stuff.\n\nOut of nowhere, a bunch of droplets hit my sunglasses and cheeks. I looked up and the kid had pulled the table skirt - which was zip-tied tightly to the table - away, stuck his arm through, grabbed the bottle of bleach, and started spraying it around.\n\nI quickly grabbed it from him as his mom laughed and reminded me he\u2019s autistic and said he has a spray bottle of water at home that he likes to spray people with.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I told her that first off, she shouldn\u2019t be encouraging him to spray people with ANYTHING without their consent, and second, that wasn\u2019t water, it was bleach, and they were both lucky I was wearing sunglasses because I could\u2019ve gone blind. She was really offended and again tried to tell me he was autistic. I said that may be an excuse for him to not realize, but she needs to be paying closer attention to her kid in public places if he\u2019s going to do stuff like that.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t brought her kid in since.

By her attitude it appears she is not even attempting to modify behavior", "NTA. You tried to correct him once w/o overstepping and at that point she should have been more mindful of him. He could have gotten hurt or hurt you.", "NTA you can judge harmful stims. They can be controlled or redirected in a lot of autistic people, and if they can't they have no business being in public potentially hurting people. Autism is not an excuse for being an asshole.

I would get playing with a spray bottle on his own as a stim, but not spraying other people with it.", "NTA. At home, that's fine. Do whatever you want, it's your problem what your child does. In public though, people are allowed to get upset that your kid is spraying them regardless of the reason that they're doing it.", "NTA. Mother needs to control her kid. Not make excuses.", "NTA.

The fact she laughed when he sprayed you really shows that she doesn't recognize that her son's actions are actually disruptive, and in this case dangerous. Not cute or funny. Even if it was just water, it's still not okay to spray someone. His mom obviously knows about this behavioral tendency, yet does nothing to try and prevent it. You did nothing wrong. Don't feel bad at all.

They start screaming and he runs off no one knows why kid is screaming.  \n\nAutism is a disability but it's not an excuse, it's not a get out of jail free card.

No idea about my kiddo yet!): Him having autism doesn\u2019t give him a pass for doing whatever he wants.

If that means he can carry his special bottle wherever, fine\u2014but he still has to learn that the spray can only be directed toward the ground, or whatever.\n\nAlso, the mom needs to learn how to help her son not reach a point where he *needs* to stim to calm down. \u201cHuh, he seems to get really overstimulated in environments where X, Y, and Z are present. I know all of those things will be at the garden department. Maybe I should talk with him about it beforehand, tell him what I know so he won\u2019t be surprised, and ask him what he thinks will help him deal with the situation, so he can bring that thing with him, or we\u2019ll know that he\u2019ll stay in this one particular area to wait, or whatever?\u201d\n\nThis is all to say, it\u2019s 100% on her.

Spraying bottles doesn\u2019t sound like a stim, TBH-it sounds like a compulsion, which is not the same thing.", "In a garden center, there're many spray bottles with worse chemicals than dilute bleach.", "You'd think for his own safety she'd discourage him from doing that. He could also have been hurt. What is she thinking??", "Especially in a grocery store which I'm sure is full of cameras. OP could easily request the footage and press charges or file a police report. Which I would legit recommend if she had been harmed and had medical bills or had to miss work.\n\nMy mom taught special ed and felt it was a huge disservice to kids when they would use their disabilities as an excuse with behavior that harmed others. Often learned from and made worse by parents. She taught at the highschool level and would try to explain the police or a jury are not going to care about your diagnosis or 504 plan after you assault someone. Yet the kids that needed to listen most, didn't.", "No, while I understand the impulse, OP did not overreact and saying that to the mother will likely cause her to think that she doesn't need to change her behavior.", "NTA, if I were sprayed with bleach on a store and my clothes got ruined, I would be going after the store.", "i was wondering if it was more of a compulsion as well, because wouldnt he bring his water bottle with?", "One thing you may want to check is to see if your workplace has an emergency eye wash station (and that it works). Not all places have them, but since grocery stores usually require some rather caustic cleaning supplies, they *should* have one for the safety of their employees, even if it isn't required by your local jurisdiction, kinda falls under that whole \"better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it\"...\n\nBut yea, you're NTA. Being autistic isn't an excuse, the mother (and social worker/counselor the boy *should* have if he's been properly diagnosed) need to ween him off of spray bottles, because the wrong bottle can cause great harm to himself or others if they are misused...", "I like how you think the stimming is the problem and not, you know, spraying people with dangerous chemicals (without warning or consent).", "Stimming isn't the issue, the fact that the mother is using it as an excuse to allow her child to assault people with cleaning bottles of chemicals and then blaming it on autism is.", "\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the issue isn't their stim but THE TYPE of stimming. Ffs they sprayed bleach at her. Though I've never had violent stims growing up, mine was basically the generic rocking, snapping, etc., if your child has a stim that could cause harm to others, you DO NOT enable it. You teach them other ways to stim or seek help from someone who can help inhibit the harmful stims.", "Likely uneducated on autism and doesn't want to hurt her kid's feelings or trigger anything. The best thing she could do is find a replacement stim or something that could emulate the feeling of pulling the trigger of the spray. Maybe an empty toy gun to carry around", "Auntie to an autistic nephew here\u2026.you are NTA. My nephew (a teenager now) used to have stims that could be disruptive in crowded/public places (singing in a weird voice, no words just a kind of loud noise in different tones), grabbing things from people that caught his eye, etc. we (his parents, grandparents and me) took the time to teach him when and where it was ok to do certain things.\n\n It took a while but he\u2019s capable of determining that himself and also letting us know that he\u2019s uncomfortable, and we remove him from the situation as soon as possible. (Very VERY proud of him, he\u2019s verbal, but it\u2019s hard to understand him unless you\u2019re used to him, but he\u2019s made incredible strides and continues to do so!!! ) \n\nIt\u2019s up to the parents/family to control what their child does. You were absolutely correct in what you said. If mum doesn\u2019t start teaching him he\u2019s gonna end up hurting someone else or himself. Mum should be ashamed of herself!!!  Everyone knows (or should know) that what happens at home is not what should happen in public.", "Stim behaviors are typically something repetitive done to address an overstimulation (hence \u201cstim\u201d). The desire to spray every spray bottle you see is compulsive.\n\nEdit to add: The action of squeezing the trigger on the bottle might be soothing and could be a stim, but given that you can\u2019t walk around spraying a bottle everywhere, mom should be offering him things that provide a similar motion-even an empty spray bottle. The fact that she hasn\u2019t explored that, and that she hasn\u2019t considered what situations might be overstimulating him, still means that NTA. If anything, knowing this is a behavior of his should have meant that she was on the watch for it and ready to redirect him. You weren\u2019t at a birthday party at her house - you were at your place of employment. She should be thankful you didn\u2019t mention it to management, because they could (and would be correct) consider it a liability. What if he had sprayed down another customer instead, or created a slip and fall scenario?", "It could have also burned your skin", "It did burn a little bit but not enough to do more than make the area a little red, thank god. I used my water bottle (as in the one I brought to drink from) to wet paper towel and wipe everything down as best as I could. It was nearing the end of my shift though so I was able to avoid touching a whole bunch of stuff until I could go inside and wash my hands and face really well with soap."]}
