Apparently one of his stims is spraying bottles. Like the cleaning kind. I didn\u2019t know this until this incident.\n\nOur setup for the garden area till is kind of a U- or C- shape. We have a cart with the till so it can be taken inside overnight, and two tables bolted together. One table has a shelf underneath where we keep various paper towels and cleaning stuff (including a bottle of diluted bleach), as well as bags for customers buying non-plant items, pots that customers have brought back for recycling, garden gloves for the employees, etc. Around the whole thing is a table skirt that\u2019s attached to the table. I really have no say in the set-up beyond moving things around on the shelf.\n\nAnyway, one day this mom brought her kid in. I saw him trying to reach AROUND the table legs to the cleaning supplies, so I moved them down the shelf closer to me and told him those bottles are for cleaning, not for touching and asked him to please leave them alone. Then I got started scanning his mom\u2019s stuff.\n\nOut of nowhere, a bunch of droplets hit my sunglasses and cheeks. I looked up and the kid had pulled the table skirt - which was zip-tied tightly to the table - away, stuck his arm through, grabbed the bottle of bleach, and started spraying it around.\n\nI quickly grabbed it from him as his mom laughed and reminded me he\u2019s autistic and said he has a spray bottle of water at home that he likes to spray people with.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I told her that first off, she shouldn\u2019t be encouraging him to spray people with ANYTHING without their consent, and second, that wasn\u2019t water, it was bleach, and they were both lucky I was wearing sunglasses because I could\u2019ve gone blind. She was really offended and again tried to tell me he was autistic. I said that may be an excuse for him to not realize, but she needs to be paying closer attention to her kid in public places if he\u2019s going to do stuff like that.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t brought her kid in since.

You are NTA. Stims serve an important purpose in our lives but there are limits and this is so far beyond what is acceptable and understandable. \n\nThat mom is also not doing her child any favours by not educating him on when and where it\u2019s okay to spray bottles - i.e. only at home and/or where you know for a fact that what\u2019s in it is safe, or one day it\u2019ll be his own eyes he sprays with bleach.", "NTA. \n\nIf the stim was annoying you would be TA, but bleach in the face can cause blindness, skin burns, and at the very least destroy clothing. It can also ruin hair.\n\nIf she can't control dangerous stimming, then she either needs CPS or an assistant. This isn't shaking a hand or bobbing their head stimming-this is assault with a chemical agent.\n\nIf you do see them again, suggest she get the assistance she needs. It's not easy raising spectrum kids, but that doesn't excuse what he did.", "NTA.  You put the blame squarely on her, which is where it should be.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn't an annoying stim - I thought stems were a form of self soothing and not a free pass to do anything including using stuff that doesn't belong to the person.\n\nYou could have been blinded or seriously injured if the spray had hit your face.\n\nThis was dangerous intrusive behavior and the parent needs to control it. By her attitude it appears she is not even attempting to modify behavior", "NTA. You tried to correct him once w/o overstepping and at that point she should have been more mindful of him. He could have gotten hurt or hurt you.", "NTA you can judge harmful stims. They can be controlled or redirected in a lot of autistic people, and if they can't they have no business being in public potentially hurting people. Autism is not an excuse for being an asshole. Honestly, I don't know if that's even a stim. Kid might just be a little shit because his mother never corrects him. I would get playing with a spray bottle on his own as a stim, but not spraying other people with it.", "NTA. At home, that's fine. Do whatever you want, it's your problem what your child does. In public though, people are allowed to get upset that your kid is spraying them regardless of the reason that they're doing it.", "NTA. Mother needs to control her kid. Not make excuses.", "NTA.   The kid is autistic; *she* isn't. She needs to learn how to parent her kid.", "Her son is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  She should thank you for the reality check.", "NTA She is responsible for monitoring her son and his actions. Autism is not an excuse for her failures as a parent,", "NTA. The kid is one bottle spray away from spritzing the wrong person.", "NTA- the mom is using her son being autistic as an excuse for not parenting. When he first tried to grab the bottles she should've made him stand out of reach of the shelves or been watching him like a hawk to intercept any attempted bottle sprays. The fact she laughed when he sprayed you really shows that she doesn't recognize that her son's actions are actually disruptive, and in this case dangerous. Not cute or funny. Even if it was just water, it's still not okay to spray someone. His mom obviously knows about this behavioral tendency, yet does nothing to try and prevent it. You did nothing wrong. Don't feel bad at all. It really was lucky you were wearing sunglasses, even very dilute bleach can really mess you up if it gets in your eyes.", "NTA as you said the kid could have seriously done some damage if the bleach got in your eyes. People need to really learn to control their kids or leave them at home", "NTA\n\nShe may not have been able to prevent his impulse, but laughing it off afterwards was totally inappropriate. That's a \"oh shit, sorry! Honey, we've talked about this\" scenario.", "NTA\n\nBeing autistic is not free license to do whatever, especially when it may endanger others.  That said, move the bottle somewhere kids (autistic or otherwise) can't get to it.", "NTA As with any child, responsibility for his actions falls on the parent or caretaker, especially since his autism further reduces his ability to identify acceptable behavior. You were correct to call her out on it, she needs to be proactive in ensuring he doesn't get ahold of chemical spray bottles, not dismiss a nearly serious incident just because \"that's how he is\"", "NTA.", "It'd be one thing if he was stimming by spraying water at inanimate objects. However, autism isn't an excuse to spray someone with \u22482% BLEACH into someone's face!\n\nIf I was the mother, I wouldn't discourage the stim. However, I'd be teaching him when/where it's not appropriate to spray bleach.\n\nNTA", "NTA it\u2019s BLEACH you absolutely could have gone blind.  It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault unless the child has the cognitive capacity to understand the word no and the concept of not doing something they are told not to do.  But the mother should be watching her kid.  \n\nWhat might make you feel better than a bunch of strangers saying you aren\u2019t an asshole is to say to the mother \u2018hey, remember when this happened?  I feel bad for maybe overreacting, I hope you don\u2019t think I was rude, I was reacting to being sprayed in the eye with bleach & didn\u2019t mean to offend you\u2019.", "You focused on what the mom was failing to do, not the son's stim, NTA", "Nta\n\nThis reminds me when I was working in retail. A kid slapped by butt.   The mom was just like it's okay he has autism. I was like it's not okay it's sexual harassment.  I ended up getting talked to because I made a customer upset.  When I told my manager what happened she told me I was in the wrong and need to learn to deal.", "Nope NTA\n\nThank God your eyes were okay.", "NTA", "NTA but you might want to find a better place to keep the chemicals in order to proactively make it more difficult for unmonitored youngsters to get the chemicals. Maybe a cabinet that can be locked or at least have a childproofing mechanism on the handles. IMO, your workplace would not be at fault if a kid got into the chemicals, sprayed others, or even drank the stuff BUT I also wouldn\u2019t leave it past some people today to try suing an outfit that this occurred at. The childproof container would probably still get opened if the child was determined enough, but the fact the chemicals were secured in such a manner would hold up a lot better in court and prove your company took steps to keep the area safe.\n\nI had a boss that decided to keep the store\u2019s cleaning supplies in an unlocked cabinet under the changing tables in our public bathrooms. I argued with him that this was begging for an incident of some sort that we would be liable for. He stood his ground until our district manager saw this and made him store them appropriately. You just gotta protect your butt in these litigation-happy days we live in.", "NTA, my son is 3 almost 4 ASD nonverbal and let me tell you. That is a dangerous stim that should have been corrected out with ABA therapy NOT encouraged. Just on the sole reason of what happened to you. What if he did that with bleach or Windex to a toddler or baby. They start screaming and he runs off no one knows why kid is screaming.  \n\nAutism is a disability but it's not an excuse, it's not a get out of jail free card. My son would be considered 'high functioning' or will need less care to help him as he learns more. It's very important to teach right or wrong because like with a neurotypical it's hard to unteach. With neural divergence it's even harder to unteach bad behaviors.", "NTA. She needs to realize that she's liable for her son hurting people, even though he has autism.", "NTA.

This could have caused serious consequences to you. If she's not returning to the store, well, there must be others where she won't feel ashamed for not having paid attention to her child.

At the very least she should have been teaching him to seek permission to spray someone with the bottle, or wait until she sought permission herself.

I don\u2019t even want to think about what could have happened if I wasn\u2019t wearing them.

Unless your plan is to put the kid in foster care and have them be abused every time they stim.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! If it had been my kid I would\u2019ve taught him to either wait for permission (whether he asked or I did) or stick to spraying inanimate objects or open air.

No really, are you sure?!\u201d", "Honestly I feel like that\u2019s not really true with a situation like this.

But I also feel like while autism may be an excuse for him to not know better, it\u2019s not an excuse for her to just let him basically assault people with unknown solutions in a bottle (it does have a clear MSDS label that\u2019s even colour-coded for employees to recognize against other bottles, but those are kind of intended for people looking at the bottles to make sure they have the right one, not for parents unfamiliar with the labels to make sure it\u2019s water and not a chemical).", "He was sitting in the cart which she left against the table.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m glad I was wearing them.
