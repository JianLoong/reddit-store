Apparently one of his stims is spraying bottles. Like the cleaning kind. I didn\u2019t know this until this incident.\n\nOur setup for the garden area till is kind of a U- or C- shape. We have a cart with the till so it can be taken inside overnight, and two tables bolted together. One table has a shelf underneath where we keep various paper towels and cleaning stuff (including a bottle of diluted bleach), as well as bags for customers buying non-plant items, pots that customers have brought back for recycling, garden gloves for the employees, etc. Around the whole thing is a table skirt that\u2019s attached to the table. I really have no say in the set-up beyond moving things around on the shelf.\n\nAnyway, one day this mom brought her kid in. I saw him trying to reach AROUND the table legs to the cleaning supplies, so I moved them down the shelf closer to me and told him those bottles are for cleaning, not for touching and asked him to please leave them alone. Then I got started scanning his mom\u2019s stuff.\n\nOut of nowhere, a bunch of droplets hit my sunglasses and cheeks. I looked up and the kid had pulled the table skirt - which was zip-tied tightly to the table - away, stuck his arm through, grabbed the bottle of bleach, and started spraying it around.\n\nI quickly grabbed it from him as his mom laughed and reminded me he\u2019s autistic and said he has a spray bottle of water at home that he likes to spray people with.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I told her that first off, she shouldn\u2019t be encouraging him to spray people with ANYTHING without their consent, and second, that wasn\u2019t water, it was bleach, and they were both lucky I was wearing sunglasses because I could\u2019ve gone blind. She was really offended and again tried to tell me he was autistic. I said that may be an excuse for him to not realize, but she needs to be paying closer attention to her kid in public places if he\u2019s going to do stuff like that.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t brought her kid in since.

By her attitude it appears she is not even attempting to modify behavior", "NTA. You tried to correct him once w/o overstepping and at that point she should have been more mindful of him. He could have gotten hurt or hurt you.", "NTA you can judge harmful stims. They can be controlled or redirected in a lot of autistic people, and if they can't they have no business being in public potentially hurting people. Autism is not an excuse for being an asshole.

I would get playing with a spray bottle on his own as a stim, but not spraying other people with it.", "NTA. At home, that's fine. Do whatever you want, it's your problem what your child does. In public though, people are allowed to get upset that your kid is spraying them regardless of the reason that they're doing it.", "NTA. Mother needs to control her kid. Not make excuses.", "NTA.

The fact she laughed when he sprayed you really shows that she doesn't recognize that her son's actions are actually disruptive, and in this case dangerous. Not cute or funny. Even if it was just water, it's still not okay to spray someone. His mom obviously knows about this behavioral tendency, yet does nothing to try and prevent it. You did nothing wrong. Don't feel bad at all.

No idea about my kiddo yet!): Him having autism doesn\u2019t give him a pass for doing whatever he wants.

If that means he can carry his special bottle wherever, fine\u2014but he still has to learn that the spray can only be directed toward the ground, or whatever.\n\nAlso, the mom needs to learn how to help her son not reach a point where he *needs* to stim to calm down. \u201cHuh, he seems to get really overstimulated in environments where X, Y, and Z are present. I know all of those things will be at the garden department. Maybe I should talk with him about it beforehand, tell him what I know so he won\u2019t be surprised, and ask him what he thinks will help him deal with the situation, so he can bring that thing with him, or we\u2019ll know that he\u2019ll stay in this one particular area to wait, or whatever?\u201d\n\nThis is all to say, it\u2019s 100% on her.

Being autistic doesn't give him permission to injure people, and he needs to learn that. She needs to make sure he has a spray bottle of water with him at all times if this is an issue, because otherwise one day he'll grab a bottle with bleach or ammonia or insect poison or some other toxic substance and really hurt someone.", "nta", "NTA. You didn\u2019t try to discipline the child,  you  addressed the source of the problem - the mother.", "Nta at all! I'm autistic and that mom was completely in the wrong", "NTA", "NTA - bleach is dangerous and you did explain that these are cleaning chemicals and attempted to move them! The mother shouldn\u2019t be laughing \n\nI think you should do an incident report with your work and ensure management is aware that firstly you got sprayed with bleach which is unsafe and could have seriously hurt you which is an occupational health and safety issue and that also keeping the cleaning fluids so easily accessible is extremely dangerous also if children are in the store and manage to get hold of these products. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like good practise for the workplace to have bleach and chemicals in spray bottles so easily accessible! The mother behaved poorly in this situation but now I think the main thing is how your employer/workplace handles this and what changes they make to ensure this doesn\u2019t ever happen again", "NTA. I\u2019m probably ignorant here but aren\u2019t stims movements or sounds people make not going out of their way to grab something and spray it?", "Of course you are NTA. Kids that age get their hands on everything as it is so they need to be watched and even more so in this case. Does she let him run wild in the supermarket cleaning jake doing this? I doubt it since she knows that what is in those bottles can be harmful. She is using his condition to excuse her total lack of attention and care and was angry that it was highlighted by the whole situation. Why doesn\u2019t she have a water bottle that she can give him to spray with when he needs one?! I would have no issue with a kid spraying me with water quite frankly (yes it would be annoying but it\u2019s not deadly) but of course it\u2019s a very serious issue when it is anything other than that.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI get the kid is young and has a stim, but that doesn\u2019t mean mom can just let him go around spraying strangers in the face with bottles he\u2019s clearly been told not to touch. She should have backed you up and kept an eye on him to make sure he didn\u2019t go back for the bottle.\n\nHer son sprayed bleach in your face and she told you to laugh it off/get over it. There are very few things you could\u2019ve said or done that I would hit you with an AH judgment for lmao.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you had a go at the kid, but we\u2019re trying to get the parent to understand how dangerous the behaviour could be. Seriously valuable lesson in my book.\n\nAs an aside, this might be something that should lead to more secure storage of dangerous chemicals at your workplace. People need to be protected from this.", "NTA - honestly I was ready to vote asshole but after reading the whole thing NO! The mothers reaction of laughing makes her a huge asshole though - as a parent if you know your child has difficulties you should make sure to keep a closer eye. Having an autistic child doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to be a careless parent!", "NTA. Her lack of parenting doesn't make you an asshole. In absolutely no situation would you have been the AH with this unless you actually shouted at the kid. Having autism doesn't entitle one to not be a parent/ be parented. It's the parent's job to stop the child from endangering others.", "NTA.\n\nSome stims don\u2019t affect other people but if a stun does, and could cause harm to someone else then she needs to help him to control it or divert his attention to something else.", "All she had to do was grab her kid. I know she heard you tell him that it\u2019s cleaning solution. Her crazy tailed self had a lot of nerve being offended. Nta", "NTA. Irresponsible Parenting isn't on you, if you sprayed bleach on customers, you'd get sued and fired.", "As someone who has had bleach in their eyes. Nta", "NTA. I have an autistic child and it\u2019s my job to keep him and others safe when we\u2019re out in public. When he develops unsafe stims, we work with him to divert the stim into a safer direction. \n\nThis is parenting an autistic 101. You keep the kid safe and you make sure other people are safe around them. Your customer is doing her son a huge disservice.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re right. Her job as the parent is to prevent her kid from doing things like that in public. And you\u2019re also correct that she shouldn\u2019t be encouraging that shitty behavior.", "NTA. You need to do an accident form and put in writing that this happened. What if another child manages to get the bottle and injures themselves? Management will deny knowing of any problems if you only tell them verbally. Make a paper trail.", "NTA.\n\nObviously the mom needs to find a better stim toy than random bottles.", "NTA", "NTA. Parenting a kid on the spectrum is tough, but you still can't let them spray bleach around. You just can't.", "NTA- I\u2019m a teacher and have had several students with autism. It\u2019s not a \u201cyou get to do anything you want\u201d syndrome the mother is acting like it is. There are boundaries and she should be setting them with him and reminding him of them, not making excuses. She wasn\u2019t monitoring him and he could have seriously injured you. You yelled at the mom, not the kid so it\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s perfectly okay for a consequence to happen for a child with autism. You almost blinded the check out lady, so you don\u2019t get to go into the store now is a perfectly acceptable consequence for an action.", "Actually shes NTA either way. Unless you work in a field directly correlating to working with special needs children/adults, it is NOT YOUR JOB to put up with or deal with someones behaviors. It doesnt matter what the persons case is. The mother needs to control her son and not act so careless about this.", "I don't care how harmless it is, you're NTA for not wanting a kid with autism to interfere with you. Does bodily autonomy just take a break for special needs children?", "he should thank you for the reality check.", "yes this \\^ she's just a bad parent and is using his diagnosis as an excuse to not have to set or enforce boundaries or show her son how to navigate life. Sad for the kid, she's really failing him. I'm sure OP isn't the first or last person this kind of thing will happen to with the two of them. I hope your eyes are okay, OP!", "Including himself. Spray bottles leak or spray in the wrong direction all the time. The mother\u2019s a corrosive flaming A.", "OP blamed the mother, not the kid, for using his autism as en excuse to allow the kid to do whatever he wants without any consequence which they are very much in the right doing. You can\u2019t keep track of your kid 100% of the time, but if you can\u2019t keep track of your child at all at the check out, don\u2019t bring your kid to the store. \n\nAlso, OP has 0 say in how the till is set up. That is not their fault.", "Her son is a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "I don\u2019t disagree with any of this, but I don\u2019t think your employer should be allowing cleaning products to be kept within customer\u2019s reach like this. These products are always marked \u201ckeep out of sight and reach of children\u201d and that shouldn\u2019t just apply in the home. None of this is your fault at all and of course in this case the mother is responsible. However, I do think your employer could be doing more to protect their staff (edit: and customers) from this kind of incident by making different arrangements for these products, since they have the potential to cause so much harm.", "I agree. We\u2019ve worked hard to help our son understand what his body needs and why it needs that", "Can you imagine the damage to their eyes? Throat?", "I have had to modify a couple of my son\u2019s stims for his safety and the safety of others, or to stop him from destroying other people\u2019s property. For this particular stim, I would have tried a hand crank fan because it\u2019d allow him to squeeze something and get a fun sound out of it, too. Spraying liquid on people and furniture constantly isn\u2019t a sustainable stim. Edit to Add: A hand cranked flashlights was a big hit for a while.\n\nI also have adhd and have had to modify my own stims to make them appropriate for whatever situation I\u2019m in. I think calling CPS is extreme, but she could use some resources to teach her how to identify safer and more acceptable ways to meet his sensory and comfort needs.", ">Spraying bottles doesn\u2019t sound like a stim, TBH-it sounds like a compulsion, which is not the same thing.\n\nLiterally my thought. OCD and autism can be comorbid, but misidentifying a compulsion as a stim kind of lends a view into mom's knowledge of autism...", "He could also have a spray bottle without dangerous chemicals in it. You have every right to keep yourself safe and the mother is a huge AH for not setting any boundaries for the kid. Stims are not a free pass to do anything they want and not Be scolded.", ">it takes a village to raise a child.\n\nBut the village, you in this case, told the child that it's not ok to go around spraying the rest of the village with unknown liquids. It's not your fault that mom didn't want to listen. \n\nA village isn't just a bunch of non-sentient humans who just sit back and let kids do whatever they want. A village is there to help parents in raising proper members of society, and that includes teaching kids how to behave in public. Most parents fail to understand that a village is also supposed to be able to discipline the kids and just expect them to rollover and tolerate all bad behaviours.", "It does not take a village to raise a child. Too many people use that as an excuse to dump their responsibilities on other people.", "Yeah that\u2019s not okay I hope there\u2019s a higher up that becomes aware of it", "Beyond that also check for a first aid kit. They are required to have a first kits that meet code: eye wash, ice packs, pain killers, tourniquet kit, bandages etc.", "Excellent points. What if he\u2019d swallowed it? NAL but I\u2019d bet the store would be facing a lawsuit.", "Like, I get that the kid has a process and it's something that seems to work for them all at home, but I'm literally disgusted and appalled at how blase the mom is acting about having bleach sprayed on their face. Ask her how she'd feel if she took that bottle and sprayed her son in the face. Or herself. She wouldn't be happy. So why should a customer service person have to be subjected to something that can scar and/or kill them if taken the wrong way. If she'd inhaled when it was being sprayed. She'd have every right to sue her.", "Gonna second this as an autistic person as well. It sounds more like an excuse the mom made up to justify her bad choice of sensory toy for her son.stims and sensory toys are different. The toys are used to direct stim behavior to, and not the actual stim itself. Like, I carry shiny rocks around with me to rub as a sensory toy. Some people use the popper things, others have other things. Some just let their finger wiggling/ankle shaking/hand flapping/ bunny hopping true stims take over instead. This mom gave him a squirt bottle to make him redirect his stims. Him reaorting to compulsively using a squirt bottle just shows she hasnt let him stim if necessary or provided proper sensory toys in situations he needs.", "Comment stealing bot.\nEvery other comment this user has made is stolen from lower in thread and reused.", "Or, if it\u2019s the sound of the spray he likes, a hand crank fan will make a nice whir and the spinning of the (soft) blades might tick another sensory box.", "well shit... im sorry to hear that. We still have cameras facing all outdoor areas of our store, it's worth it to ask if you haven't already. As much I hate the cameras (I swear they know if I yawn at any time) I know that if anything like this or worse happens to me there is a record.  \n\n\nIf you don't have outdoor facing cameras and your management isn't into the idea of it, if you're a Union store, you can go to the Union with your concerns.", "Raising an autistic child can be hard. But I would tell them he could have seriously injured himself as well by spraying himself with bleach. Is that compassionate? Would you be doing the mother a favor by letting her son potentially cause permanent harm to himself? No, you would not be."]}
