Her parents and her three siblings (Ricardo, Ana and Bruno) live here in the US too with their respective families, everyone but Bruno who's the youngest is married. As they're from a different culture that do some stuff that we would consider weird in America, one of which is giving a kiss on the cheek as a hi, I've grown used to do it so I didn't mind it until now.\n\nAround like two months ago (maybe a bit more) Bruno called the whole family to tell us he's gay. I don't hate gay people and I never thought myself to be an homophobe, I congratulated Bruno as did everyone else.\n\nWe were having a good time in family after that and this is when my problem came. Bruno said, in front of everyone, that if I wasn't married to his sister he would \"jump on me\". Everyone laughed, but it was certainly uncomfortable to me. Later he double it down by saying I have a \"cute ass\". Might I add that ana's husband was there too, and Bruno said nothing to him, only me. \n\nWhen Sandra and I came back home I tried speaking about how uncomfortable his \"joke\" has made me feel, but she just brushed me off by saying that Bruno always jokes like that. She doesn't see why now is different. \n\nNext time we saw each other (which was soon after that because her family is very close) was at our home. Bruno had come pick up my eldest two kids off to take them to a baseball game. When I opened the door Bruno said hi and then he leaned in to kiss me. I realized now that he kissed me too close to my lips rather than my cheek. After that wherever we saw each other I kinda just pretended to be sick or to be busy so I can just shake his hand as a hi. \n\nApparently Bruno had noticed this because yesterday my wife came up to me and asked me if Bruno had done something to make me angry at him. She told me Bruno has seen me \"off\" everytime he's near and wants to know if he should apologize for something.\nI told her the same thing I had told her before plus the kiss thing. She told me I'm exaggerating, Bruno was jus joking and such. I've tried telling her that it feels very weird that your BIL (key word: brother) would tell me he likes me and would pursue a relationship with me if I wasn't already family. I've tried saying that I can't talk to Bruno about this, but she told me not to do it. She told me that if my reasons to not give him a kiss are because I'm homophobic then she'll made up a lie for Bruno. She also told me she's very disappointed.

It sounds like he's flirting with you despite you saying you're not interested.

It\u2019s not homophobic to be uncomfortable at advances from someone, especially a family member.", "NTA, It's still unacceptable behavior by your BIL . Announcing he's gay, doesn't give him a pass to be a creep.", "NTA- You need to tell him the unwarranted flirting is making you uncomfortable because you don't have experience with enough gay men that this is making you uncomfortable. Eventually, I hope you can lighten up a bit because he is, as you said, around frequently and a big part of your kids' lives. Be upfront about everything, set a firm boundary that cheek kisses are to remain neutral and respectful, and that it's fine to joke when it's in taste. If he tried that crap with your wife if he was your brother, he'd get chewed out for disrespecting your wife and your relationship, would he not? So this is no different from any other situation where a stranger or someone close is flirting with your spouse, but it does read homophobic as well.

You can treat them with the disrespect of training them like toddlers.  \n\n\nOr, set a boundary with Bruno: \"If you kiss me too close to the lips or you hit on me again, I will leave,\" in view of everyone else.

I'd ignore your wife and talk to Bruno about this and how it has made you uncomfortable as that is the only way to solve this on your behalf at this point. Also another thing to keep in mind is that Europeans have a different way of looking at things than Americans and sometimes that can get lost in translation.

If he was  your SIL and behaved this way, you would have every right to be offended--just because he is a man does not excuse the behavior.  You should call him out on his BEHAVIOR, not your feelings.  Tell him that saying \"I would jump on you\" is not acceptable behavior with his sisters spouse.  Your wife should absolutely back you on this.\n\nSecond, it sounds like you have a bit of homophobia.  Otherwise, how can you explain \"he kissed me too close to my lips..\"--do you measure anybody else's cheek kisses?  Take it from someone who grew up with kissing cheeks, both men and women, to us there is literally no difference between kissing on the cheeks and shaking hands.  \n\nAlso, tell your wife to stop minimizing her brother's bad behavior and maximizing yours.", "I recognize the point many have made here about objectification, and I agree with it in principle.  However, I wonder if there is a bit more nuance to this.  If OP was a single man, and Bruno was an attractive woman who said the exact same things, would OP be upset?  I doubt it.  Maybe Bruno was inappropriate, I can certainly see that.  But I don't think the OP is concerned with being catcalled.  I think he's concerned with being catcalled by a gay man.  \n\n(And, I'm not judging OP for that, it's a stupid bias that's unfortunately been baked into many of us since we were kids.

Reading your story makes me uncomfortable for you. \n\nMain point, I love the LGBTQ+ community and I love my friends and family (including the in-laws that hit on me) so this is not a bash on that community, just Bruno's actions.  \n\nFirst the jokes. They are objectifications about you and they made you uncomfortable. The next time it happens, you have to quickly and clearly shut it down. Talk with Bruno 1-1 and then reinforce the boundaries. \n\nSecond, kisses are fine until you KNOW when they are not, and continue to not be OK. If it happens once or even twice... no worries. If it continues to happen then it is a common theme and intentional on his side for pushing the envelope. The same way it would be wrong for you to do that to a woman again and again.\n\nOne of my male in-laws is one of the ones that kiss on the cheeks which I have no issues with, until on the day of his mothers funeral, he kissed my cheek then decided to pull back, hold my face in his hands and force a kiss on my lips in front of everyone. I made no scene because.. you know... funeral. But that was not OK, despite telling my wife about it. She thought that he was just playing around and was not being serious. He tried again to kiss closer to my lips on later family events, but I put a stop to that by being firm and stopping the kisses altogether and going just for the hug.\n\n\\- For further information, these in-laws were individually trying to engage me in conversations that were clearly inappropriate, sexual in nature and flirtatious. I am sure they did not know the other member of their family was doing the same thing, but either way it is wrong on all levels. My wife thought that they were simply being friendly and seeking another male perspective on things. It was not until I told her my what my therapist said, did she realize that she was blinded by family love. She is now backing my boundaries with them. \n\nBack to your case - It is possible that Bruno may not be objectifying you, but from what you stated, I think your intuitions are correct. Set the boundary with him and let him know that you do not appreciate the jokes, that you love and care about him, but they make you uncomfortable. I think that once you deal with the jokes, that will resolve the kissing issue. If he tries to push past your boundaries, then go LC and tell your wife how you feel and that she is not listening to you as she is blinded by her love of Bruno - the same way my wife was blinded about my in-laws. \n\nLastly, and this is important - tell Bruno that despite all of this, you still love him **as family**, and love him just as he is through and through. As long as he respect your boundaries, he should be OK. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA - I don't think it's homophobic behavior to want your wife's brother to NOT hit on you.

Since everyone laughed at one of them, it seems like at least the first remark was intended as a joke. You didn't verbally communicate to Bruno that you were uncomfortable, but maybe your body language was clearer. He hasn't said anything like that to you again. He did the regular face kissing one time after he made the remarks, and then he's accepted your excuses to not do it every time he's greeted you since. Now that he's seen you enough times for it to be clear that you no longer want him to greet you with the regular face kiss, he has asked if he did something wrong AND if he should apologize. This is the behavior of someone who tried meeting you with the behaviors that are acceptable in his social circle (your wife's family) and who is pulling back appropriately at your signals that you don't want to be subject to those behaviors. While Bruno's two remarks the night he came out might qualify as a single act of sexual harassment, you have not described Bruno as continuing to flirt with, harass, or make sexual jokes at you. \n\n2) Because Bruno made sexual remarks to you, you no longer feel comfortable with him greeting you with a kiss. Your feelings are your feelings, your face is your face, and your new boundaries around kissing are 100% valid.\n\nI honestly think you'd be better off telling Bruno the things he actually said that led to you drawing this new boundary, because otherwise, he's trying to imagine what changed, and, for him, the most significant thing he said right before your new boundary around kissing was, \"I'm gay.\"\n\nEven if you don't want to (or can't because of your wife) tell Bruno about the remarks, IF he tries to greet you with a kiss again, you should, privately and plainly, tell him you don't want to be greeted that way anymore. However, I give it a 50/50 chance that Bruno doesn't actually try to greet you with a kiss ever again. Because he actually seems to be responding to your social signals, from the way you tell this story.\n\nYour wife is the asshole for not taking it seriously that somebody's sexual remarks to you made you uncomfortable.

You're literally blaming the victim for the perpetrator's actions. Lile I said, I'm all for encouraging OP to advocate for himself and defend his right to be comfortable, but he is in no way at fault for BIL's continuing actions. A grown ass adult absolutely knows better than to make sexual comments about his sister's husband, and he doesn't need to be told to stop to know that he's being inappropriate. BIL never asked for OP's consent to openly sexualize him in front of others. \n\nAlso, are you not aware that distancing yourself from the peraon you're uncomfortable with and not letting them touch you in certain ways *is* a way of communicating that you don't want them to touch you? Like, if a guy asked a woman to give him a hug, she backed away, and he moved into her space and forcefully gave her a hug, would you be saying that she physically needed to say \"no\" to get him to atop and that it's her fault for allowimg it to happen? No, bc nonverbal methods of communication are acceptable and he never got a \"yes\" to show consent. \n\nI also hope you realize how much situations like this can mess with someone's head. OP did attempt to address this with his wife, who totally shot him down and criticized him for making a big deal out of a \"joke.\" That can absolutely mess with someone's confidence about dealing with things like this and cause them to second-guess themselves, or convince them to settle things quietly (like simply mot letting BIL kiss him) instead of bringing it up when you know no one will support you. You realize if he did say anything, the person who *should* be on his side would be mad at him, right? That's *devastating* for ppl dealing with sexual harrassment. Not to mention how men are unfortunately taught not to make a big deal of things and if they do, they're weak. \n\nConfronting someone who is sexually harrassing you is stressful-you never have any idea how they'll react, if ppl will believe you, if you'll be viewed as less than for admitting you were a victim, etc. It's not always as simple as \"just say stop.\" I'm genuinely happy that you are able to tell strangers to leave you alone, but not everyone has the courage to stand up to a sexual harrasser, especially when the situation is that it's your BIL and your wife's family might share her views and be upset with you and you'll have no one on your side and suddenly it's not juat you vs your BIL but you vs your wife's family.", "NTA.

My best friend is from Spain, and as we are both girls and comfortable, we actually don't touch each others faces but rather peck the air near the cheek on both sides. We don't actually make contact. There's no reason for Bruno to be getting so close especially after COVID. So he has no reason to be doing that to you period. Plus, your in America and you are culturally American, we don't do those other greetings outside of very specific and consenting circumstances. Just tell him your not comfortable with it period.  You can even refuse the rest of the families greetings of similar action so he doesn't feel single out.", "Are we forgetting that the alleged \"sexual harassment\" happened at the time Bruno came out? Maybe Bruno felt the air was a little tense and made a joke about hitting on OP, because by his own admission, he congratulated Bruno? Bruno thought OP was an ally and was open to joke and get him through a super stressful day.\n\nAs for the kiss on the cheek that was \"too close\" the very next time OP saw Bruno. How close is too close for a straight OP to be kissed by a gay man. I'm guessing even the forehead might be too close. And it was that time, that OP pondered every other kiss on the cheek? That if Bruno was trying to make a move, he would've planted one on him to test the waters before he came out??\n\nTo recap, most of you are calling Bruno a sexual harasser for making jokes on the day he came out (and only that day) and for kissing OP on the cheek likely just as he had done for years prior.\n\nI am going to say maybe even subconsciously, OP is a little homophobic. The \"I like gays as long as they don't give me a European kiss on the cheek\" type.

Can you keep the jokes targeted toward him pg?\" is \"pitting his wife against her brother\" and causing trouble in the family? Like, if the BIL can't handle being told to stop making those kinds of jokes without it rocking the boat and affecting his relationship with his sister, there are serious issues.

It's not okay.\n\nRegardless of orientation, no means no, and should be accepted, and being married to his sister just makes you an automatic ultra-no.", "I'm gay. It is absolutely not okay to flirt with someone who you know is straight, married, or in a relationship of any type, and clearly uncomfortable with the advances. It is not cute to try and \"convert\" someone. It comes off as rapey in my opinion and fucked up to hide behind your sexuality as a response. \nNTA.", "Hey, trans mlm here. You are NTA at all, Bruno needs to control himself and keep it in his pants.\n\nWhat he's doing isn't a joke, it's sexual harassment. I'm sorry your wife isn't taking this seriously. I'd recommend avoiding BIL until situation is sorted. Hope you're okay", "NTA. Bruno is sexually harassing you and it\u2019s not ok. This has nothing to do with his sexuality or yours. It would be the same if this was your SIL making these comments/gestures. \n\nAlso not sure how Bruno \u2018always jokes like that\u2019 given that he has only just come out as gay. Maybe he was sexually harassing girls for laughs previously? Either way, he shouldn\u2019t be asking Sandra whether he should apologise - that\u2019s just gossiping. He should just be stopping his inappropriate behaviour.\n\nThe biggest problem is that your wife is being wilfully blind on this and using her brother\u2019s sexuality as an excuse not to see the problem. You deserve her support in setting boundaries here.", "NTA. I'm Argentinian, so personal space is inexistent. We kiss and we hug literally everyone(family, friends, complete strangers, you name it), but if my sibling's partner made inapropriate comments about me I would do the same as you", "NTA. Americans infantilize gays so much they don't expect civil behavior from them. Unless you're able to comment on your sister-in-law's ass, or your brother-in-law is able to talk about your wife's ass, none of yall should.", "NTA\n\nIf Bruno was not attracted to you, but you would be distant, purely because he is gay? That would be homophobic. However, that is not the case.\n\nHe literally said: \"I would jump on you if you weren't married to my sister.\" And then, he said that you have a 'cute ass' and tried to kiss you on the lips. He behaves ina Which means that he is attracted to you. Of course it makes sense to be more distant when the guy is attracted to you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend used to be friends with a lesbian woman who kept hitting on her in a very creepy way. My girlfriend tried to address her behaviour, but this woman wouldn't listen. So eventually, my girlfriend started to act more distant and I told this creep that her behaviour was creepy.\n\nWas this lesbophobic? No. If this former friend was a straight man instead of a lesbian woman, my girlfriend and I would have responded to her behaviour in exactly the same way.\n\nBeing gay is not a 'get out of jail' card for creepy behaviour. Calling out harassment is not homophobic.\n\nWhen a man instantly assumes that a gay guy wants to sleep with all men, or when a woman instantly assumes that a lesbian wants to sleep with every woman, that is homophobic. Distancing yourself from someone because you assume that they must be into you because they are gay? That is homophobic. But distancing yourself from someone or calling them out because of obvious harassment? That is not homophobic.", "Nta. \n\nHe made aggressively optional comments that sexualized you.   It's not homophobic to feel uncomfortable by that.\n\nBruno should apologize.   Your wife should stfu and mind her own business.", "NTA. Why is it so fucking hard to let a man have their boundaries and personal space?   \n\n\nYour wife is a MAJOR asshole for brushing off the way you feel and how uncomfortable you are with the comments that hes making about you. If my brother made those comments to my girlfriend/wife/whatever I would get right in his face and tell him off and then probably cut contact. Its disrespectful and downright gross.\n\nBrother in law is an asshole for making those comments to you, period. You don't get a \"Bruno always jokes like that\" bullshit as an excuse for poor behavior. Imagine if I went and groped my brothers wife and hes like, \"Oh Konocti always jokes like that.\"  in response to her complaining about my behavior.", "I mean, you're not avoiding him because he's gay, you're avoiding him because he's being inappropriate and it's making you uncomfortable.", "NTA OP! \n\nYou're not being homophobic. Maybe work on communicating it better with your wife. \n\nu/AfternoonGullible983 question.... how do gays (particularly gay guys in this scenario) feel when females say \"Such a waste that you're gay. If you were straight, I'd jump you immediately/I'd make you mine/ etc\". My gay guy friends laugh it off but my gay girl friends react differently (when straight guys say that to them)", "One of my lesbian ex friends had a crush on our straight friend and she would make it so obvious make jokes about how 'she can change her'", "NTA\n\nCame here to say this exact thing. That's some classic sexual harassment and would be gross to do to anyone regardless of the genders involved.", "I am so glad it wasn\u2019t just me.", "Op likes to flirt with women. He doesn't want to flirt with a man. That doesn't make him homophobic, it makes him straight.", "If your brother was hitting on her, saying that she has a nice ass and trying to \"accidentally\" kiss her on the lips, would she think that was ok? NTA", "NTA\n\nI totally get what you're saying, I'd feel weird as well\n\nAnd your wife is totally dismissing your feelings, IMO you totally need to tell your wife that she is belittling you and your feelings\n\nAnd YES you totally need to to speak to Bruno, Tell him you respect him and is choices, that you still love him as a brother but that you are totally uncomfortable with his attentions towards you.", "NTA\n\nSexual harassment isn't okay, regardless of who the aggressor and victim is. No one would take you seriously when you said his comments made you uncomfortable (when someone in a workplace could get fired over that sort of thing). It's not homophobic to not be sexually attracted to another man or to reject flirtatious advances.", "If your brother was making comments to your wife about how hot she was and how he wanted to jump on her ass, would she be ok with this? Would you? You and his family members should have put a stop to this immediately and told him those comments were unacceptable. This is not a joke.\n\nI do have to ask, why do you think it's ok to \"congratulate\" someone on being gay? That's weird.", "NTA but you need to frame it differently. It's not that he's gay that you have a problem with, it's the fact that he's constantly making advances on you. If he were straight and you were a woman he'd have likely been called out as a disgusting pervert because that's how he's acting.", "NTA. You didn't become distant because he's gay, you became distant because he was sexually harassing you.", "NTA. Just because hes gay dosent mean he cant make you feel uncomfortable.  He did and that's valid. Not homophobic. \n\nPeople misuse that word so much I barely register it anymore. I'm bisexual..apparently because I'm not into trans I'm transphobic and I'm homophobic for not wanting to sleep with every woman I meet. It's insane to me. Just because I am attracted to both genders dosent mean I'm attracted to every person I see. And I have a right to say no. Just like you have a right to your personal space.", "Nta. Leave your wife", "NTA\n\nIf your wife has a sister, loudly exclaim in front of everyone how much you like her ass, and would totally bang her if you weren't married. See if she brushes THAT off as just a funny joke.", "You are definitely NTA. I'm gay, and what he did was highly inappropriate! He doesn't get to say these things, and then wonder why you don't want to be around him. And if the family considers you homophobic after that, then they are delusional as well. Setting boundaries for someone who has already demonstrated that he will cross them is not homophobic, it's taking care of yourself.", "Definitely NTA and I thought you were going to be the asshole when I started reading it lol\u2026 I thought you were going to say you stopped the kiss on the cheek the next time you saw him after he came out which could possibly make you TA. After I read it all, this isn\u2019t even a debate. It\u2019s just sexual harassment and extra off putting since it\u2019s your BIL.", "NTA. Keep your kids away from Bruno.", "NTA. If you were a woman he was attracted to and said those things it would be sexual harassment. No difference.", "NTA though do recommend pulling Bruno to the side one day and communicating that the jokes he made resulted in you feeling uncomfortable maybe throw in you'd feel the same way if a girl made the comments to him. Don't do it in front of anybody just communicate your discomfort. If he's not intending to be a creep hopefully he'll apologize and hold back on the jokes.", "\"You're overreacting\"; \"it's just a joke!\"; \"that's just who I am\"; and so on, are really the usual response of abusers: they know they are wrong, but could never admit it, so the only escape is gaslighting.\n\nNext time you see a beautiful woman, tell your wife \"If I was not married to you, I would jump on her\" and then \"It's just a joke\", I'm sure she'll laugh! /s\n\nNTA big time\n\nAlso, I'm in Europe, know many Spaniard, and if it's true that the kiss on the cheek is a cultural thing, the sexual harassments is NOT (and as someone else said the sexual orientation is irrelevant)", "NTA.  This is sexual harassment.", "Women aren't taken seriously at all what world do you live in?\n\nSexual assault in general regardless of gender is brushed under the rug.", "so, did Bruno always joke like that before? Do you remember?  \n\n\nBecause, it does seem weird that if Bruno cracked those kinds of jokes before you knew he was gay, it made it okay.  \nBut now that he's out and those jokes got directed at you, now, only now, it makes you uncomfortable.  \nSo, yeah, you are kinda homophobic.  \n\n\nIt doesn't excuse Bruno's apparently widespread general sexual harassment.  \nI mean, if it makes you uncomfortable now, Have you thought about how the women around you felt when everyone assumed he was straight?  \n\n\nAnd your wife doesn't look great not supporting you in this issue, but now I have to wonder, did you tell Bruno to stop if he made sexual comments about her, before he came out?  \n\n\nYou're NTA for feeling uncomfortable with Bruno's sexual comments, but if you were ignoring them before and now they only matter to you because he's openly gay, it does really make you look homophobic.", "NTA. You're not being distant because he is gay, you're being distant because he is making comments that could be considered sexual harassment. I'd be uncomfortable too.", "NTA\nTell your wife you're disappointed in HER. She accepts her brother's shitty behaviour as normal, brushes off her partner and tries to gaslight you and on top of that, insinuating you're being homophobic. That's a way to twist a narrative, I'm honestly floored.", "Dude, they're messing with you. Generally men don't kiss each other on the cheek in Spain, they shake hands unless they're both gay. Since you're straight you're fine just shaking hands with him. As for two women or a man and a woman yeah it is very common to give each other a kiss on the cheek.\n\nSource: I'm from Spain.", "NTA. It could be that Bruno is not deliberately trying to harass you, but if these things make you uncomfortable, it's your right to set boundaries. Maybe you should talk with your wife again and explain to her that it's not about gender. What if this was your brother making these comments towards her, wouldn't it feel at least a bit uncomfortable?", "NTA. That\u2019s classic sexual harassment and you\u2019ve done nothing wrong by feeling uncomfortable by it.", "Or would his wife have the same reaction if he said and did the same stuff to her sister?", "Probably because when women are sexually harassed by straight men they brush it off too lol.", "if bruno has always been making \"sexually inappropriate jokes\" around family, then it's not just OP's wife, but also his MIL, and any SIL's as well, but also ALL THE MEN who didn't see a problem with it when Bruno was closeted.  \n\n\nNot just wife and Bruno, but the whole family culture, which is, TBH kinda normal. Families say things around each other that they may not say in front of people who aren't in the family. Families will often disregard behavior that in certain spaces would be considered wildly inappropriate.   \n\n\nBut if Bruno was making those \"Jokes\" before and OP didn't have a problem with it then, it is homophobic if he has a problem with it now. It doesn't excuse Bruno's inappropriate behavior, but it also doesn't make OP not homophobic.", "Beautiful said.\n\nThere\u2019s only one fact and it doesn\u2019t change regardless of sexuality or gender; intentional unwanted physical/verbal affection is harassment.
