Her parents and her three siblings (Ricardo, Ana and Bruno) live here in the US too with their respective families, everyone but Bruno who's the youngest is married. As they're from a different culture that do some stuff that we would consider weird in America, one of which is giving a kiss on the cheek as a hi, I've grown used to do it so I didn't mind it until now.\n\nAround like two months ago (maybe a bit more) Bruno called the whole family to tell us he's gay. I don't hate gay people and I never thought myself to be an homophobe, I congratulated Bruno as did everyone else.\n\nWe were having a good time in family after that and this is when my problem came. Bruno said, in front of everyone, that if I wasn't married to his sister he would \"jump on me\". Everyone laughed, but it was certainly uncomfortable to me. Later he double it down by saying I have a \"cute ass\". Might I add that ana's husband was there too, and Bruno said nothing to him, only me. \n\nWhen Sandra and I came back home I tried speaking about how uncomfortable his \"joke\" has made me feel, but she just brushed me off by saying that Bruno always jokes like that. She doesn't see why now is different. \n\nNext time we saw each other (which was soon after that because her family is very close) was at our home. Bruno had come pick up my eldest two kids off to take them to a baseball game. When I opened the door Bruno said hi and then he leaned in to kiss me. I realized now that he kissed me too close to my lips rather than my cheek. After that wherever we saw each other I kinda just pretended to be sick or to be busy so I can just shake his hand as a hi. \n\nApparently Bruno had noticed this because yesterday my wife came up to me and asked me if Bruno had done something to make me angry at him. She told me Bruno has seen me \"off\" everytime he's near and wants to know if he should apologize for something.\nI told her the same thing I had told her before plus the kiss thing. She told me I'm exaggerating, Bruno was jus joking and such. I've tried telling her that it feels very weird that your BIL (key word: brother) would tell me he likes me and would pursue a relationship with me if I wasn't already family. I've tried saying that I can't talk to Bruno about this, but she told me not to do it. She told me that if my reasons to not give him a kiss are because I'm homophobic then she'll made up a lie for Bruno. She also told me she's very disappointed.

It sounds like he's flirting with you despite you saying you're not interested.

It\u2019s not homophobic to be uncomfortable at advances from someone, especially a family member.", "NTA, It's still unacceptable behavior by your BIL . Announcing he's gay, doesn't give him a pass to be a creep.", "NTA- You need to tell him the unwarranted flirting is making you uncomfortable because you don't have experience with enough gay men that this is making you uncomfortable. Eventually, I hope you can lighten up a bit because he is, as you said, around frequently and a big part of your kids' lives. Be upfront about everything, set a firm boundary that cheek kisses are to remain neutral and respectful, and that it's fine to joke when it's in taste. If he tried that crap with your wife if he was your brother, he'd get chewed out for disrespecting your wife and your relationship, would he not? So this is no different from any other situation where a stranger or someone close is flirting with your spouse, but it does read homophobic as well.

You can treat them with the disrespect of training them like toddlers.  \n\n\nOr, set a boundary with Bruno: \"If you kiss me too close to the lips or you hit on me again, I will leave,\" in view of everyone else.

I'd ignore your wife and talk to Bruno about this and how it has made you uncomfortable as that is the only way to solve this on your behalf at this point. Also another thing to keep in mind is that Europeans have a different way of looking at things than Americans and sometimes that can get lost in translation.

If he was  your SIL and behaved this way, you would have every right to be offended--just because he is a man does not excuse the behavior.  You should call him out on his BEHAVIOR, not your feelings.  Tell him that saying \"I would jump on you\" is not acceptable behavior with his sisters spouse.  Your wife should absolutely back you on this.\n\nSecond, it sounds like you have a bit of homophobia.  Otherwise, how can you explain \"he kissed me too close to my lips..\"--do you measure anybody else's cheek kisses?  Take it from someone who grew up with kissing cheeks, both men and women, to us there is literally no difference between kissing on the cheeks and shaking hands.  \n\nAlso, tell your wife to stop minimizing her brother's bad behavior and maximizing yours.", "I recognize the point many have made here about objectification, and I agree with it in principle.  However, I wonder if there is a bit more nuance to this.  If OP was a single man, and Bruno was an attractive woman who said the exact same things, would OP be upset?  I doubt it.  Maybe Bruno was inappropriate, I can certainly see that.  But I don't think the OP is concerned with being catcalled.  I think he's concerned with being catcalled by a gay man.  \n\n(And, I'm not judging OP for that, it's a stupid bias that's unfortunately been baked into many of us since we were kids.

Reading your story makes me uncomfortable for you. \n\nMain point, I love the LGBTQ+ community and I love my friends and family (including the in-laws that hit on me) so this is not a bash on that community, just Bruno's actions.  \n\nFirst the jokes. They are objectifications about you and they made you uncomfortable. The next time it happens, you have to quickly and clearly shut it down. Talk with Bruno 1-1 and then reinforce the boundaries. \n\nSecond, kisses are fine until you KNOW when they are not, and continue to not be OK. If it happens once or even twice... no worries. If it continues to happen then it is a common theme and intentional on his side for pushing the envelope. The same way it would be wrong for you to do that to a woman again and again.\n\nOne of my male in-laws is one of the ones that kiss on the cheeks which I have no issues with, until on the day of his mothers funeral, he kissed my cheek then decided to pull back, hold my face in his hands and force a kiss on my lips in front of everyone. I made no scene because.. you know... funeral. But that was not OK, despite telling my wife about it. She thought that he was just playing around and was not being serious. He tried again to kiss closer to my lips on later family events, but I put a stop to that by being firm and stopping the kisses altogether and going just for the hug.\n\n\\- For further information, these in-laws were individually trying to engage me in conversations that were clearly inappropriate, sexual in nature and flirtatious. I am sure they did not know the other member of their family was doing the same thing, but either way it is wrong on all levels. My wife thought that they were simply being friendly and seeking another male perspective on things. It was not until I told her my what my therapist said, did she realize that she was blinded by family love. She is now backing my boundaries with them. \n\nBack to your case - It is possible that Bruno may not be objectifying you, but from what you stated, I think your intuitions are correct. Set the boundary with him and let him know that you do not appreciate the jokes, that you love and care about him, but they make you uncomfortable. I think that once you deal with the jokes, that will resolve the kissing issue. If he tries to push past your boundaries, then go LC and tell your wife how you feel and that she is not listening to you as she is blinded by her love of Bruno - the same way my wife was blinded about my in-laws. \n\nLastly, and this is important - tell Bruno that despite all of this, you still love him **as family**, and love him just as he is through and through. As long as he respect your boundaries, he should be OK. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA - I don't think it's homophobic behavior to want your wife's brother to NOT hit on you.
