Her parents and her three siblings (Ricardo, Ana and Bruno) live here in the US too with their respective families, everyone but Bruno who's the youngest is married. As they're from a different culture that do some stuff that we would consider weird in America, one of which is giving a kiss on the cheek as a hi, I've grown used to do it so I didn't mind it until now.\n\nAround like two months ago (maybe a bit more) Bruno called the whole family to tell us he's gay. I don't hate gay people and I never thought myself to be an homophobe, I congratulated Bruno as did everyone else.\n\nWe were having a good time in family after that and this is when my problem came. Bruno said, in front of everyone, that if I wasn't married to his sister he would \"jump on me\". Everyone laughed, but it was certainly uncomfortable to me. Later he double it down by saying I have a \"cute ass\". Might I add that ana's husband was there too, and Bruno said nothing to him, only me. \n\nWhen Sandra and I came back home I tried speaking about how uncomfortable his \"joke\" has made me feel, but she just brushed me off by saying that Bruno always jokes like that. She doesn't see why now is different. \n\nNext time we saw each other (which was soon after that because her family is very close) was at our home. Bruno had come pick up my eldest two kids off to take them to a baseball game. When I opened the door Bruno said hi and then he leaned in to kiss me. I realized now that he kissed me too close to my lips rather than my cheek. After that wherever we saw each other I kinda just pretended to be sick or to be busy so I can just shake his hand as a hi. \n\nApparently Bruno had noticed this because yesterday my wife came up to me and asked me if Bruno had done something to make me angry at him. She told me Bruno has seen me \"off\" everytime he's near and wants to know if he should apologize for something.\nI told her the same thing I had told her before plus the kiss thing. She told me I'm exaggerating, Bruno was jus joking and such. I've tried telling her that it feels very weird that your BIL (key word: brother) would tell me he likes me and would pursue a relationship with me if I wasn't already family. I've tried saying that I can't talk to Bruno about this, but she told me not to do it. She told me that if my reasons to not give him a kiss are because I'm homophobic then she'll made up a lie for Bruno. She also told me she's very disappointed.

It sounds like he's flirting with you despite you saying you're not interested.

It\u2019s not homophobic to be uncomfortable at advances from someone, especially a family member.", "NTA, It's still unacceptable behavior by your BIL . Announcing he's gay, doesn't give him a pass to be a creep.", "NTA- You need to tell him the unwarranted flirting is making you uncomfortable because you don't have experience with enough gay men that this is making you uncomfortable. Eventually, I hope you can lighten up a bit because he is, as you said, around frequently and a big part of your kids' lives. Be upfront about everything, set a firm boundary that cheek kisses are to remain neutral and respectful, and that it's fine to joke when it's in taste. If he tried that crap with your wife if he was your brother, he'd get chewed out for disrespecting your wife and your relationship, would he not? So this is no different from any other situation where a stranger or someone close is flirting with your spouse, but it does read homophobic as well.

You can treat them with the disrespect of training them like toddlers.  \n\n\nOr, set a boundary with Bruno: \"If you kiss me too close to the lips or you hit on me again, I will leave,\" in view of everyone else.

I'd ignore your wife and talk to Bruno about this and how it has made you uncomfortable as that is the only way to solve this on your behalf at this point. Also another thing to keep in mind is that Europeans have a different way of looking at things than Americans and sometimes that can get lost in translation.

If he was  your SIL and behaved this way, you would have every right to be offended--just because he is a man does not excuse the behavior.  You should call him out on his BEHAVIOR, not your feelings.  Tell him that saying \"I would jump on you\" is not acceptable behavior with his sisters spouse.  Your wife should absolutely back you on this.\n\nSecond, it sounds like you have a bit of homophobia.  Otherwise, how can you explain \"he kissed me too close to my lips..\"--do you measure anybody else's cheek kisses?  Take it from someone who grew up with kissing cheeks, both men and women, to us there is literally no difference between kissing on the cheeks and shaking hands.  \n\nAlso, tell your wife to stop minimizing her brother's bad behavior and maximizing yours.", "I recognize the point many have made here about objectification, and I agree with it in principle.  However, I wonder if there is a bit more nuance to this.  If OP was a single man, and Bruno was an attractive woman who said the exact same things, would OP be upset?  I doubt it.  Maybe Bruno was inappropriate, I can certainly see that.  But I don't think the OP is concerned with being catcalled.  I think he's concerned with being catcalled by a gay man.  \n\n(And, I'm not judging OP for that, it's a stupid bias that's unfortunately been baked into many of us since we were kids.

Reading your story makes me uncomfortable for you. \n\nMain point, I love the LGBTQ+ community and I love my friends and family (including the in-laws that hit on me) so this is not a bash on that community, just Bruno's actions.  \n\nFirst the jokes. They are objectifications about you and they made you uncomfortable. The next time it happens, you have to quickly and clearly shut it down. Talk with Bruno 1-1 and then reinforce the boundaries. \n\nSecond, kisses are fine until you KNOW when they are not, and continue to not be OK. If it happens once or even twice... no worries. If it continues to happen then it is a common theme and intentional on his side for pushing the envelope. The same way it would be wrong for you to do that to a woman again and again.\n\nOne of my male in-laws is one of the ones that kiss on the cheeks which I have no issues with, until on the day of his mothers funeral, he kissed my cheek then decided to pull back, hold my face in his hands and force a kiss on my lips in front of everyone. I made no scene because.. you know... funeral. But that was not OK, despite telling my wife about it. She thought that he was just playing around and was not being serious. He tried again to kiss closer to my lips on later family events, but I put a stop to that by being firm and stopping the kisses altogether and going just for the hug.\n\n\\- For further information, these in-laws were individually trying to engage me in conversations that were clearly inappropriate, sexual in nature and flirtatious. I am sure they did not know the other member of their family was doing the same thing, but either way it is wrong on all levels. My wife thought that they were simply being friendly and seeking another male perspective on things. It was not until I told her my what my therapist said, did she realize that she was blinded by family love. She is now backing my boundaries with them. \n\nBack to your case - It is possible that Bruno may not be objectifying you, but from what you stated, I think your intuitions are correct. Set the boundary with him and let him know that you do not appreciate the jokes, that you love and care about him, but they make you uncomfortable. I think that once you deal with the jokes, that will resolve the kissing issue. If he tries to push past your boundaries, then go LC and tell your wife how you feel and that she is not listening to you as she is blinded by her love of Bruno - the same way my wife was blinded about my in-laws. \n\nLastly, and this is important - tell Bruno that despite all of this, you still love him **as family**, and love him just as he is through and through. As long as he respect your boundaries, he should be OK. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA - I don't think it's homophobic behavior to want your wife's brother to NOT hit on you.

It\u2019s super weird that someone would ever feel comfortable proclaiming that as a \u201cfetish\u201d.", "It\u2019s funny you say that, there\u2019s an (un)popular reality show here in the UK where recently two gay guys were talking about their ideal man. One said the usual (as I guess we all would) \u2018cute, great butt and ideally totally into me!\u2019 That\u2019s a good call! \n\nThe other guy said pretty much the same but also added \u2018totally straight\u2019 to his list of ideal factors.\n\nI mean, I know that so many \u2018straight\u2019 men have lived thru \u2018straight\u2019 lives before being able to summon the strength and courage to come out as gay, and finally live the way they want, and to finally feel the relief of being their true selves. \n\nBut why would a gay man list in his qualities as a partner \u2018must be straight\u2019. Can anyone shed light in this? Because I\u2019d truly love to learn why that is?\n\nNTA. This wouldn\u2019t be acceptable if her sister/any other female in the fandom was slapping it on you.", "Similar experience here. I am friends with quite a few gay people. 2 of them would walk up to straight men and grab their junk at house parties looking for a reaction - definitely predatory. Most folks seemed amused until one of them did this to a gay man who (rightfully) punched him in the face. Never happened again.\n\nAlso, per my gay friends, it\u2019s a common fantasy for gay men to want to sleep with \u201cstraight\u201d men, but more in a *if you\u2019re curious, let me know* way - not in a predatory way at all.", "u/Adrock_4the_Win is all about consensual sexual encounters!!!

People do make jokes like that, I have an all guy friend group and I'm the only girl. Yeah, remarks can definat.ely be made and I join in just as bad. Thats our humour. And if anyone takes it too far, we talk.\n\nOP has already stated he has always made jokes like that, but not to him or men before he came out as gay.  From the BIL point of view most likely logical while he was not comfortable coming out yet. It has only been jokes. Referred to by OP and the family as jokes. Being uncomfortable is however not okay and something the BIL needs to be made aware of. BIL will probably feel bad for making OP feel that way. \n\nNo way of knowing without talking. Something he needs to deal with, not his wife. She, most likely being dismissive only because the idea of her brother meaning it is absurd. And a bit soon to call it sexual harassment, thats only escalating situations quickly. Judging and ruling first, assessing the situation later.", "Because they\u2019re just predators. The fact that they are gay is irrelevant.", "The same reason a lot of straight men can't see it when they or their friends act that way toward women", "i would presume,\n\nthey live in an echo chamber, where repeated unwanted sexual pursuits are far more permissible acceptable than in normal society,\n\nand because of that they think that everybody is as accepting to receiving sexual advances, as the people in their echo chamber.\n\nor, to put it in other words, they are living in a culture that is equivalent to one in which slapping the waitresses' bum as she passes, is acceptable and in good sport.", "What? That would mean they're not really straight and probably bi-sexual.\n\nStraight men do not want to hook up with gay men, that's not a thing.", "So you\u2019re basing your judgment on an assumption that you have no way of proving or disproving?", "So when I as a woman, get cat Called on the street or leered at in public am I being harassed or at I being weirded out because some men made some stupid jokes?", "I expect it's actually largely for the same reason straight dudes engage in the exact same behavior towards women who aren't interested in them: arrogant entitlement.", "Same logic as a trans shooter being the victim of the hate crime they committed", "2 things. How are black people getting brought up in this? And black people CANT be racist. They don\u2019t have the power to do so. They can be prejudiced however.", "I'm assuming that by \"they\", you mean gay people. If that is the case, I would like to correct you, \"they\" do not live in a reality where *repeated unwanted sexual pursuits are far more permissible.* Also, \"they\" also don't think that *everybody is accepting to receiving sexual advances.* Lastly, \"they\" also don't *live in a culture that is equivalent to one in which slapping the waitresses bum is acceptable.*\n\nAll of those statements are off-base and actually homophobic. You're sitting here trying to tell everyone that most people, who are gay, have loose moral values and are predators. That's making a lot of assumptions. Do you know many gay people?", "It absolutely is a thing. Wanting to try/experience  something different doesn\u2019t change your identity.", "It absolutely is a thing. Now you can probably make arguments that a lot of these guys are in the closet even from themselves, or that they have some issues to unpack with their therapist, or that they're hetero-romantic but bi-sexual and haven't figured out that there are words for that - but no matter which way you cut it, the fact remains that there are a surprisingly large number of men who identify as \"straight\" but who still seek out same-sex hookups.", "You make a fair point.  I didn't think I was \"Judging,\" but I concede I have drawn a conclusion with no way to substantiate it.", "I'm sorry those things have happened to you, but the OP's situation is not the same thing.  Those strangers who harassed you are potential threats of which you are rightly wary.  The OP's BIL made admittedly stupid comments around the entire family.  They were jokes.  Tasteless and inappropriate, but jokes nonetheless.  The OP is distancing himself from Bruno because he was uncomfortable that a dude made them; that's not the same as some lecherous lurker scheming to harm you on the street.", "Yes but you won't get people en mass running cover for the straight men.\n\nYou are mostly correct though.\n\nIn many ways the same behavior just in one instance you get the protection of your group more than another.\n\nI tend to think of it as randoms bad behavior is caught and the first things said is do you know who my dad is?\n\nSame energy on a societal scale", "True enough \n\nLogical consistency has gone out the window in our society for some reason", "Black people can absolutely be racist.
