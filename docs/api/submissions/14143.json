Her parents and her three siblings (Ricardo, Ana and Bruno) live here in the US too with their respective families, everyone but Bruno who's the youngest is married. As they're from a different culture that do some stuff that we would consider weird in America, one of which is giving a kiss on the cheek as a hi, I've grown used to do it so I didn't mind it until now.\n\nAround like two months ago (maybe a bit more) Bruno called the whole family to tell us he's gay. I don't hate gay people and I never thought myself to be an homophobe, I congratulated Bruno as did everyone else.\n\nWe were having a good time in family after that and this is when my problem came. Bruno said, in front of everyone, that if I wasn't married to his sister he would \"jump on me\". Everyone laughed, but it was certainly uncomfortable to me. Later he double it down by saying I have a \"cute ass\". Might I add that ana's husband was there too, and Bruno said nothing to him, only me. \n\nWhen Sandra and I came back home I tried speaking about how uncomfortable his \"joke\" has made me feel, but she just brushed me off by saying that Bruno always jokes like that. She doesn't see why now is different. \n\nNext time we saw each other (which was soon after that because her family is very close) was at our home. Bruno had come pick up my eldest two kids off to take them to a baseball game. When I opened the door Bruno said hi and then he leaned in to kiss me. I realized now that he kissed me too close to my lips rather than my cheek. After that wherever we saw each other I kinda just pretended to be sick or to be busy so I can just shake his hand as a hi. \n\nApparently Bruno had noticed this because yesterday my wife came up to me and asked me if Bruno had done something to make me angry at him. She told me Bruno has seen me \"off\" everytime he's near and wants to know if he should apologize for something.\nI told her the same thing I had told her before plus the kiss thing. She told me I'm exaggerating, Bruno was jus joking and such. I've tried telling her that it feels very weird that your BIL (key word: brother) would tell me he likes me and would pursue a relationship with me if I wasn't already family. I've tried saying that I can't talk to Bruno about this, but she told me not to do it. She told me that if my reasons to not give him a kiss are because I'm homophobic then she'll made up a lie for Bruno. She also told me she's very disappointed.

It sounds like he's flirting with you despite you saying you're not interested.

It\u2019s not homophobic to be uncomfortable at advances from someone, especially a family member.", "NTA, It's still unacceptable behavior by your BIL . Announcing he's gay, doesn't give him a pass to be a creep.", "NTA- You need to tell him the unwarranted flirting is making you uncomfortable because you don't have experience with enough gay men that this is making you uncomfortable. Eventually, I hope you can lighten up a bit because he is, as you said, around frequently and a big part of your kids' lives. Be upfront about everything, set a firm boundary that cheek kisses are to remain neutral and respectful, and that it's fine to joke when it's in taste. If he tried that crap with your wife if he was your brother, he'd get chewed out for disrespecting your wife and your relationship, would he not? So this is no different from any other situation where a stranger or someone close is flirting with your spouse, but it does read homophobic as well.

You can treat them with the disrespect of training them like toddlers.  \n\n\nOr, set a boundary with Bruno: \"If you kiss me too close to the lips or you hit on me again, I will leave,\" in view of everyone else.

I'd ignore your wife and talk to Bruno about this and how it has made you uncomfortable as that is the only way to solve this on your behalf at this point. Also another thing to keep in mind is that Europeans have a different way of looking at things than Americans and sometimes that can get lost in translation.

If he was  your SIL and behaved this way, you would have every right to be offended--just because he is a man does not excuse the behavior.  You should call him out on his BEHAVIOR, not your feelings.  Tell him that saying \"I would jump on you\" is not acceptable behavior with his sisters spouse.  Your wife should absolutely back you on this.\n\nSecond, it sounds like you have a bit of homophobia.  Otherwise, how can you explain \"he kissed me too close to my lips..\"--do you measure anybody else's cheek kisses?  Take it from someone who grew up with kissing cheeks, both men and women, to us there is literally no difference between kissing on the cheeks and shaking hands.  \n\nAlso, tell your wife to stop minimizing her brother's bad behavior and maximizing yours.", "I recognize the point many have made here about objectification, and I agree with it in principle.  However, I wonder if there is a bit more nuance to this.  If OP was a single man, and Bruno was an attractive woman who said the exact same things, would OP be upset?  I doubt it.  Maybe Bruno was inappropriate, I can certainly see that.  But I don't think the OP is concerned with being catcalled.  I think he's concerned with being catcalled by a gay man.  \n\n(And, I'm not judging OP for that, it's a stupid bias that's unfortunately been baked into many of us since we were kids.

Your issue and distancing isn't because he is gay, it's because of his comments and actions.", "NTA\n\nWas a little worried in the first half, NGL. But the good news is you\u2019re not a homophobe! You\u2019re just being sexually harassed.\n\nIf Bruno were a straight dude hitting on his sibling\u2019s wife this wouldn\u2019t even be a fucking question.", "NTA. It\u2019s not homophobic it\u2019s inappropriate sexual advances.", "It\u2019s funny, I was JUST having this conversation with someone yesterday. \n\nI have a LOT of gay friends and will stand up for homophobia any day, any time. That being said, I have noticed a few (not a lot) but a few of my gay male friends have seemed to make it their mission in life to sleep with a straight man. \n\nThis goes from saying crude things in front of straight men to even getting them so wasted that I doubt the straight guys in this scenario even could protest. When I called them out on it, they tried to claim I was homophobic. Boy, no. I\u2019m predatorphobic and its assholes like them that give the gay community a terrible name. I find their actions no different than a guy being aggressive/inappropriate to a woman.\n\nNeedless to say, I have stopped being friends with them.", "Another gay man here in complete agreement. Making sexual comments about family members is gross.", "Or if it was her sister saying that about her husband and kissing her husband on the mouth, she'd probably shit bricks.", "Facts", "Never mind the married part.  Even if OP were single, it\u2019s still unwanted sexual overtures.", "And if he asked if the roles were reversed and it was him to Ana they will say \"That's different\"", "Also you're absolutely NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBruno needs to sort his behaviour out", "Your siblings spouse saying they\u2019d \u201cjump on you\u201d isn\u2019t a compliment anyone should be comfortable taking no matter how comfortable they are with their sexuality.", "I'm European and I don't find Bruno's behaviour appropriate at all. \n\n>someone who is comfortable with their sexuality will take a compliment as it is meant.\n\nIf OP was a lesbian woman and Bruno an hetero man you would still find it a compliment? He didn't just say that OP is attractive, he said that he'd jump on him, it is not the same.\n\nNTA.", "He's always been someone to make a lot of jokes but he had never insinuated he was into me before", "See\u2026 to me the kissing business sounds like something OP was never really comfortable with and then became more uncomfortable with after his sisters brother \u201cjoked\u201d multiple times about being attracted him.", "Why is OP homophobic? Because he doesn\u2019t want to be hit on by his BIL, because he doesn\u2019t want to be harassed by him?", "OP isn't being homophobic, he's being sexually harassed. Shame on you for victim blaming.", "So because Bruno is gay he can harass whoever he wants?", "Bruno is sexually harassing OP.\n\nYOU need to be better; stop victim blaming. There is no more nuance to this - OP is not comfortable with Bruno's comments or advances.\n\nBruno needs to stop; end of story.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Your hypothetical doesn't make sense. A straight guy needs to work on himself because he's comfortable flirting with an attractive woman instead of a gay man? I don't understand your point.", "It's catcalling, plain and simple. If he were a straight dude telling a woman she had a great ass, and that if she wasn't married he'd be all over her, it'd be harassment. Even if she thought of herself in terms of sexual attraction with men.\n\nIt would be even more disgusting if he tried it on a lesbian woman.\n\nBut actually it's super disgusting now matter the sex and sexual orientation of his victim. The only person here who needs to get over themselves is you.", "Complete BS, what Bruno said was highly inappropriate. What would the reaction be if OP told his SIL that he would \"jump on her\" if he wasn't married.", "What the fuck? If \"Bruno\" ever did that to me, he's getting clocked.", "His exact words were that he would \u201cjump on him\u201d if he wasn\u2019t married to his sister tho. \nIf a man or a woman said that to me(romantically attracted to both) I absolutely wouldn\u2019t feel flattered.\n\nIdk, maybe some people would feel okay with it but for those who feel differently, their feelings should be valid.", "He's sexually harassing OP.\n\nHe doesn't get a pass for that just because he's gay.\n\nHell, he tried to kiss OP without his consent - who are you to say he wouldn't try and escalate?\n\nOP is NTA.", "Bruno is essentially catcalling OP. Those \"jokes\" are sexual harassment and they wouldn't be acceptable from a man toward a woman, and they aren't acceptable from Bruno toward OP.\n\nNow, maybe Bruno's a nice guy who didn't mean it like that and deserves a chance to make things right and stop doing things like that (and be more careful with his kisses, because if OP was fine with the cheek kisses before, then he should be fine with them now absent all the rest), but OP isn't the asshole for trying to avoid being harassed.", "I\u2019m sorry but no this was not a joke and as others have pointed out if OP made this joke about his wife\u2019s sister he would be the AH but he\u2019s just got to sit back and take it\u2026 absolutely not \nBeing gay doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to harass people", "This is a strange take. As a straight female I would never comment on my BIL\u2019s butt or tell him that if he wasn\u2019t married I\u2019d jump him. That\u2019s completely inappropriate.", "That's just disgusting. How do they not see themselves how predatory this is?! :(", "As a straight guy who is an ally and has had lots of queer friends and hung out in queer spaces, I've also noticed a toxic behaviour over the years that will often be directed at 'new' or unknown straight guys who show up, by a certain type of gay man\n\nBasically they will be overly flirty or full-on touching and coming on to a guy and being super over the top, as if they are trying to elicit a homophobic reaction.\n\nI see it as a 'test' to assess new people, and I sort of understand where it's coming from...but I find it really distasteful and immature when it's directed at me. In some cases I've felt like they're almost disappointed not to be able to turn it into an argument/big drama.", "There are literally straight people that want to hook up with gay person, they just need to look in the right places instead of harrassing random people", "It's definitely OK to ask him to cut it out then.  That's a perfectly reasonable boundary.", "\"he kissed me too close to my lips..\" C'mon really??  Did he measure?  I am in no way excusing the BIL's behavior, nor the wife's--yikes.", "That's not at all what I said.  Bruno made stupid comments for sure.  What I'm saying is that if Bruno weren't gay, OP wouldn't care.", "Why is he uncomfortable?  Is he worried Bruno going to seduce him and convince him to have sex with him?  I doubt it.  Again, Bruno shouldn't be making the comments.  But OP wasn't concerned about being objectified.  OP is weirded out because a gay dude made some stupid jokes.", "[deleted]", "Cause by default they are the victims in their own minds at all times.\n\nSame logic in black people cannot be racist.", "That\u2019s just a stupid take. Bruno made MULTIPLE sexually charged comments, Bruno kissed OP in an uncomfortable way and you\u2019re right if Bruno wasn\u2019t gay there wouldn\u2019t be an issue because there would be no sexual context there. \nFor example as a woman if my gay best friend complimented my boobs \u201cyour boobs look great in that shirt\u201d it\u2019s fine because there\u2019s no sexual undertone it\u2019s a genuine compliment of my straight guy friend said it, it would be completely different. If you don\u2019t get that then you are part of the problem not the solution", "You see tho, OP caring about what people say or do to their body is, you know. The fucking point.", "How AI of you.", "Okay"]}
