The thing is, when I say that no, I'm fully Chinese it is usually the end of it. People just accept it and move on.\n\nExcept one person in my university friend group is a lot more curious than what I'm used to. For example he'd ask questions like; \"How are you muslim if you're Chinese?\", \"Why do you have a Chinese name instead of a \"muslim\" name?\" or \"Why don't you cover your hair if you're practicing?\".\n\nA week ago, someone asked me whether I'm going home for Ramadan. I told them I'm probably not because I went home for CNY so I've already seen my family pretty recently and flights are expensive. Immediately he goes \"You celebrate Chinese New Year? I thought you said you're muslim\". These are just some of the things he's asked me. \n\nI'm not entirely sure how to deal with this. I've answered all of his questions but some of them are a lot more personal than I'm comfortable with. Asking him to stop, which I've done privately wasn't effective because he said he just wanted to \"learn\" more about me. \n\nThe thing is I don't feel like he's asking because he's curious I feel like he's doing it because he's trying to catch me in a lie or something. The way he phrases the questions and the tone that he uses is very off putting to me. I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt or even brush it off as a cultural difference but my gut is telling me otherwise.\n\nSo now I try not to interact with him as much, but since our friend group is fairly small it's noticeable that I'm kind of ignoring him. I don't really want this to spill over and affect my relationship with my other friends. I hate conflict.
