First post, on mobile, yada yada yada I might suck.\n\nI (late 30sF) have been under pressure lately (ever since I turned 30) to find a husband and have children, as I have the best luck of my siblings to have healthy-ish children. My older sister S (40sF) is happily childfree aside from an amazing 12-year-old step-daughter from her fianc\u00e9e that she doesn't have to help raise. She does not want any kids, even if she was not 40. My brother A (30sM) is now a high-functioning young man with autism. He was non-verbal until middle school. He is scared of passing on his Autism and having to raise a child \"like him\" since mental health disorders such as Schizophrenia and Autism do run in my family. There has yet to be a man born on my dad's side without being on the Autism Spectrum.\n\nOnto me. I have a lot of psychological and physical traumas with which to contend. I am convinced I will never find a partner but have become comfortable with physical intimacy again after years. The man, T, had previously wasted my time romantically, so we simply agreed to have a healthy sexual relationship. We do not know many details about each other. I know he has kids and no wife, but I couldn't tell you his living situation. He knows my brother still lives with me. \n\nOne of my best friends, J, one of 5 men I trust to be safe in a car with AND with my life, started panicking as he just turned 50 and realized that he has no heir to his considerable assets. He suddenly regretted the one abortion his ex had (mutual decision) 30 years ago. While mutually confiding over our gripes, J approached me with a proposal: what if we got married? I could have my successful husband and partnership and he could get a kid. He even brought up that he knew we could make an amazing couple as we already have an excellent friendship, we are both financially stable, and we both value family and open communication. Plus our mothers are good friends. We agreed to date for a month to make sure we are truly compatible. The month went well and we agreed on mutual exclusivity from here on out and are now trying to handle the logistics.\n\nT has started bugging me about how long this latest thing is going to last. I finally revealed that I had found my marriage of convenience and the guy was adamant about exclusivity, so never. T blew up at being cut completely off forever with no warning. Our mutual friends have gotten involved and are, aside from being annoyed that we kept it quiet for so long, saying that I am an asshole for \"leading him on\" for so long. But I have openly told everybody that I'm looking for a marriage of convenience (though I'm apprehensive about the kid part, but that's another story). Am I the asshole for cutting off my situationship to marry my best friend?\n\nEDIT: I was told to add this information so thank you for the feedback. I am 4th generation American. seriously, many of my relatives and ancestors helped build the roads you drive on, dams you use to collect water, and railroad tracks you receive goods on.

Otherwise you are entering into the marriage on false pretenses.", "Damn, that\u2019s a doozy! But NTA. The agreement you have with J is gonna benefit both of you. That situationship doesn\u2019t really benefit you. You have to think about what\u2019s best for YOU. T can move tf on.", "NTA, although this situation is very foreign and strange to me, it almost seems like an arranged marriage. Based on practicality instead of feelings, I mean. \n\nI wish you good luck!", " NTA. Your impending marriage and plans for parenthood may not stem from the usual happily-ever-after trope that we are sold, but because you and J have planned and thought out the potential pitfalls and legacy planning for your future kid(s), you will be the best parents possible because they are planned for and wanted. Your friendship with J also tips the scales to a healthy marriage.\n\nT can take a long walk off a short pier. He\u2019s only considering himself.", "NTA. Bang buddies are an open relationship usually, and are a cancel-any-time thing. T is just upset that he won\u2019t be getting commitment-free sex anymore and now has to try and actually be in a relationship with a woman.", "NTA. Super interesting post and responses, though. The way you write makes me wonder if you are autistic as well.", "NTA, you are the main character. Pop off", "NTA I\u2019m going to assume based on the acceptance of this being normal that arranged marriages are a thing in your culture.  For Americans we look at marriage differently.  But if you are content and happy with this decision and you truly want it, go for it!! Good luck!! And T is outta luck, your life, your choice!", "NTA\n\nFeel like a few people may vote YTA because of the romanticism idea of what marriage is. The only way you would be ta is if you continue to stay in contact with T. Kids aside, it seems like t is only bugging you because his sexual relationship with you is going to stop and he knows that. He doesn't seem like he cares about what you want but what you can provide for him.", "NTA - T lost the right to get pissy about OP's \"loyalty\" (in a way) when he wasted their time in an unsuccessful romantic relationship. If OP has been very open to T (and everyone in their life) that they wanted something serious, then it was not \"no warning\". Also, it's definitely not \"leading him on\" if both OP and T had agreed to a purely sexual relationship after the romantic relationship failed. I hope you enjoy your life with J, OP. Good luck with any future pregnancy!", "NTA - Absolutely this sounds like a win win in your complicated situation. T was just a fwb, nothing more. No need to spend any more time or worry about that situation. Be happy and best wishes for a successful marriage and children!", "Have you been to therapy to work on the traumas you've been through? You mention how you had to become comfortable with physical intimacy again after years, and that implies some very painful possibilities as to what you've endured. I'm wondering how much this has affected how you view relationships in general. \n\nAfter reading your comments, I think the way you talk can seem detached to many western ears, but it seems more pragmatic to me. When defining your future with J, and the expectations you have from a marriage of convenience, it sounds like you're being very analytical. \n\nWhen you actually talk about J though, your tone noticeably shifts. Suddenly warmth, respect, admiration, and a general sense of happiness, comes out. I know we can hype up how important it is to fall in love and feel butterflies, but the chemistry that causes that effect doesn't last for years and years. You sound like you skipped past that step. \n\nMy own relationship started as friendship. We became closer over time, and after knowing him for about a year and a half, I asked why we weren't dating (I could only drop so many hints lol). I fell head over heels for him, butterflies and all. We've been together for 10 years now, and it's not about butterflies anymore, it's just moved to the next phase. \n\nMy husband is the one person I can share every facet of myself. We confide, lift each other up, and laugh about nothing. The uncertainty of a new relationship is long gone, replaced by a solid foundation I know I can trust. It may sound cheesy to some, but I really did marry my best friend.\n\nI feel like you could end up in the same place with J, and that you're not far off. Things like the desire to have a child can change when you find the right person. I never wanted anything close to being a 'housewife,' especially cooking and baking. Now, I've happily spent hours making dinner for him. Love can be odd sometimes.\n\nI know I've rambled here, but I'm hoping you'll take a moment to analyze the possibility that you already *are* in love, but maybe trauma makes it hard to view it that way right now. Even if I'm completely off base, and my optimistic outlook clouded my view, I hope you find your best path forward.", "ESH - You and J for having kids for all of the wrong reasons and I feel sorry for any that come of this \"relationship\".   T can gtfo though since he was just a FWB.\n\nLOL at the \"we value family comment\" when my J is 50 and only wants an heir and you don't seem to care about having kids but will have one so you can have a successful husband??", "NTA and I don't get people who think you're going into this with poor reasons. Your situationship is just upset his easy benefits are ending. \n\nI think a kid could do a lot worse than two parents who respect and care for each other, and who have similar values.", "EHS. Do you even want to be a mom? Bringing a human life into a marriage of convenience feels really wrong to me.", "You are NTA for wanting to live your life as you see fit, do want is right for you, not what everyone thinks you should do.", "NTA -  T is obviously angry that hes losing his easy sex hope you find everything that you've always wanted in this marriage of convenience.", "NTA- good luck!!!!!", "NTA\n\nT will get over it and it ain't your job to help him do it.", "NTA. It sounds to me like you were not in an exclusive situationship. There were no romantic feelings and it doesn't even sound like you were friends beyond an agreeable sexual compatability. \n\nI'm honestly confused he wanted notice of an end to the situationship. Like he had hired you for a job and needed you to continue in your role until he found a replacement. You are under no obligation to continue a sexual relationship if you do not want to. I have no idea how you were considered to be \"leading him on.\"", "NTA\n\nYou are making a decision about your own life. The fwb dude has no vote since it's just sex. If this makes you happy, then do it.", "NTA. T is just upset you are no longer an option for easy sex. You can change your mind at any time about having sex. You don't have to give notice or reasons or any of that BS. T sounds like a creep who thinks women owe him sex.\n\nI actually disagree with Reddit regarding your marriage. I think a relationship built on mutual respect, friendly affection, honest communication and mutual interests is as good a starting point as any other for a relationship.", "NTA. You are going into this having planned and talked through everything. Best of luck to you both.", "NTA. Do what you want. There\u2019s no single path to a successful marriage. Marrying for love doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness.

Blood is irrelevant in this day and age.", "NTA. Your FWB needs to get over himself. If you truly believe this is what's best for you, then do it. Many people have excellent marriages and say \"I married my best friend.\" Good for you and I wish you all the best. \n\nI'd like to ask a question that you may feel free not to answer. From what I've read in your comments, the idea of bloodline is rather important to you, so I'm assuming adoption is not an option. Is there some reason surrogacy isn't an option? You mention you and your fiance have decent monetary means. I'm only curious because of your comments about risking yourself in pregnancy/childbirth. It seemed like you were speaking of yourself as high risk.", "I think you should be commended instead of hated upon.

We know how to raise kids far better than many fools who go out there, fall in love, and then turn into bitter old harpies/grumpy old fools\n\nI bless those and pray for our world.", "And I agree completely about financial readiness. My dad had my sister take a financial readiness course before she moved her boyfriend and stepdaughter into her house. \n\nAnd I agree completely about financial readiness. My dad had my sister take a financial readiness course before she moved her boyfriend and step-daughter into her house.", "My mom used to think women were only carriers, however, my daughter actually got ill. So apparently she inherited it.\nI did a research when I was considering having a second child before my daughter's condition fully developed, talked to geneticists.", "i think they mean that you\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s what J wants and he can also provide you the marriage you want too, but you personally might not gaf abt having kids which might lead to problems", "They are making value judgments based on their own cultural experiences of marriage. It sounds like you have thought this through from all angles, so I wouldn't worry about randoms on Reddit assuming your approach is inherently wrong. NTA", "Also whole post about how other bother her to marry and have kids. Not one word about wanting any of it herself\n\nAlso that guy wanting an heir... best reason to have children. Not. This will end in disaster", "Oh! Thank you for the clarification. Anybody but him I would be terrified. But since I know we would do right by each other, and do share a deep Philia, I am willing to enter into this journey with him. So I gamf lol. Luckily over the years, we have had this discussion about kids. Even in the last few months, he was talking about the lack of kids and I blurted out \"I would have a kid for you.\" We have the right support system to alleviate the most important of my concerns. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it is an excellent point because, honestly, he is the best way to get the marriage I want. If that includes the full kid and dog thing too? Only with him would I do it. \n\nThere was one other candidate I was consiering to have kids with, but with religious differences regarding baptisms, it would have been quite a struggle. So J, in addition to being one of my best friends and favorite people, is simply the best. \n\nThere was one other candidate I was considering having kids with, but with religious differences regarding baptisms, it would have been quite a struggle.

I have yet to see any (and I know many) that fall apart outside of reality television when done for the right reason. Sometimes life is more than about yourself. Sometimes life is about both yourself and what is best for the whole. The downside of an individualized society.", "Have your considered that you might actually love this man? It sounds like it to me. You keep calling it a marriage of convenience but you trust him. You would only have a kid with him. You only would take this journey with him. He's your best friend...... that's love. \n\nJust tell T you love the man you're going to marry. Tell everyone. You don't have be IN love to tell everyone you love him. They'll be happy for you and stop being so judgemental.", "So if something happens to him, you\u2019re ok raising the child by yourself?", "Okay,  but do you actually *want* a kid? Like really and truly, with all your heart,  regardless of any man or husband?\n\nToo many people have kids because they're supposed to, or because their spouse wants a kid,  or because they don't have a choice.  But a child that isn't wanted 100% for *themselves*, is going up end up hurt.", "I understand your point but there are plenty of people who marry for convenience or in an arrangement.

Sometimes life is about both yourself and what is best for the whole. The downside of an individualized society. \n\nNo way in hell would there be an open relationship. Our culture takes honor, loyalty, and monogamous faithfulness extremely seriously. We share that. If we are married, we are married. But we will be discussing it throughout the engagement. It is not going to be quick lol. Like a year.", "The marriage is kind of besides the point honestly, this whole thing is about bringing a human being into the world and you don't seem to actually want kids.", "What are you even talking about. Of course it can work. But do you actually *WANT* It for yourself? What is the right reason? Wanting an heir (his reason) and wanting to conform to what people say(yours)? Best for the whole wtf...\n\nLike I obviously don't care what you do, just saying this sounds dumb af. You only have one life and its sad to throw it away cause people or society or whatever wants you to do something", "Marriage for convenience is fine. Having children in such a marriage isn\u2019t fair to the children.", "I do have love for him. The Philia love of friends and equals. And that's what we will be in this partnership: equals. I don't trust Eros love, but I do trust Philia love. I, sadly, would self-sabotage if I felt full Eros love. That's what led me to consider a marriage of convenience in the first place. \n\nThat's a good point! They wouldn't doubt it either. We don't like to be at the same event without giving each other a huge hug, seek each other out at events to sit near, and have all sorts of side conversations. Bystanders would believe it. Ok thanks!", "Yes. And vice versa. I'm likely to die before him though. We have discussed the possibilities and plans for plans lol. We would prefer neither of us to die lol, but are prepared for either. Or both.", "With just any man? My answer is complicated because again, life is not clear cut and paste. I find people weird who want kids for themseelves because, due to my profession, I see what happens to many of those kids. They turn out to be poorly raised because those parets are often the ones who don't want to provide any consequences for the actions of the child, creating a cesspool of entitlement and learned helpness all because they are Mommy or Daddy's little angel.\n\nPlus, as I have mentioned above, I could possibly die during childbirth or pregnancy for numerous reasons. I am not going to take that risk for a fluke or because I'm \"in love.\" I'm only going through that for the right partner. I want to live and be able to see a family I make grow. He is the best of 2 options for that. And again, frankly, I trust my best friend to go through that with me."]}
