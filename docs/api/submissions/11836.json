{"id": 11836, "submission_id": "11mi7av", "title": "AITA for not wanting to apologize over and over again for my daughter's upbringing?", "selftext": "I (45F) had my daughter, CJ (now 28F) when I was 17 years old. Her father did not stick around and we really struggled for a bit. Even when I graduated college, I had a bunch of student loan debt as well as juggling rent, food and other expenses. CJ never lacked necessities, but I admit she didn't get a lot of material possesions. I would try to save up as much as possible to make Christmas and birthdays as fun as possible, but she didn't get much else throughout the year and we only went on 2 vacations total in her childhood. We definitely ate a lot of struggle meals and had to move often. We honestly teetered on the poverty line.\n\nWhen CJ was 17, I was finally debt free, got a promotion at work and was doing much better. I did start to give her things throughout the year. I used my bonus to take her to Disney World-somewhere she always wanted to go but couldn't. It was nice that after years of struggling, I could spoil her a little.\n\nShe went off to college and in this time, I met my husband \"Matthew\". We got married and now have 2 kids together, \"Jack\" (5M) and \"Melissa\" (6F). With our combined incomes, we live quite comfortably. I admit, Jack and Melissa have gotten a lot more than CJ did at that age. I've certainly never left her out. She's always invited on our trips (we pay), I get her random gifts throughout the year, birthdays and Christmases are bigger. I'm trying to make it as even as I can, but I know it realistically never will be.\n\nCJ first pointed out the discrepancy a couple of years ago we took the kids to Disney (CJ went with us). I sat CJ down and apologized for her childhood. I said I wish I had been in a better place when she was their age, I know I can never truly make up for it, etc. I said I know it'll take time for her to heal from that.\n\nI thought that was it, but since then, CJ has constantly complained whenever her siblings get anything. I'm always super sensitive to her feelings, validate them etc. But things came to a head recently, on Jack's birthday. Instead of a party, he opted to see the off-broadway production of Frozen. We as always, invited CJ to come along, as well as her fiance. The whole night, she was pouting and seemed upset. I tried talking to her but she brushed it off. We went to dinner after the show. Jack and Melissa were excitedly talking about it. CJ then butted in \"You know what I got for my 5th birthday, Jack? A Barbie from the dollar store.\"\n\nThe kids didn't really see the big deal, but the adults at the table understood. I was civil the rest of the meal but later called CJ and told her what she did was unacceptable. I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so. I said I was disappointed and hung up. Later, CJ sent me a very long text, telling me I was a horrible mother.

I can\u2019t think OF one one present I ever received from my parents (not to discredit them because they paid for literally everything in my life). But I always knew they did their best and I have always been grateful. CJ really needs to speak with a therapist and work on her insecurities. I don\u2019t get the hint from your post that you neglected her while giving her siblings more. NTA", " NTA from info given. She\u2019s almost 30 years old and acting like a petulant child. From what you said, you truly did your best to raise her in a healthy and happy home and make sure she felt loved and had fun things from time to time. \n\nIt sounds like she resents your \u201cnew family\u201d with husband and younger children but life goes on and you include her in all these vacations etc and you did the best you could as a young single mother and built a better financial life over time and with the help of a stable partner. \n\nIt sounds like CJ needs therapy to work through these issues. She doesn\u2019t seem to have any perspective or maturity. \n\nUnless there\u2019s more to the story\u2026", "NTA - as a child who grew up well below the poverty line, I could resent my mother. But instead, I salute her for grinding. By the time I was graduating college so was my mother and she lived a wonderful life after that point. Mama is gone now (RIP) but I NEVER ONCE MADE feel bad about struggling and affording my brother more than me.", "Not only are you NTA, but major kudos to you for your accomplishments.\n\nYou had a kid at 17, as a single mother. Yet, you still managed to not only graduate from high school, but college as well. You also kept a leveled head and prioritized what little money you did have. Would she have been happy to have more toys and less food? \n\nYou know what is more important than materialistic things? Love and attention, which you gave her. I\u2019m sorry that she doesn\u2019t see it like that, and I feel bad for you that she doesn\u2019t appreciate you trying to spoil her more as an adult. I can understand children being more materialistic, but she is 28. She knows the cost of living and the difficulty it must have been to do that single. If she never says it, I will: Good job, mom. You took a shitty hand and made a beautiful life with it. You did nothing wrong, 100% NTA.", "NTA.  I think your daughter needs to talk to a professional, honestly.  She has a lot of built up resentment, and thinks it's acceptable to lash out to make you feel bad for being more successful now than when she was little.\n\nAnd you have guilt, that probably makes you put up with a lot more than you should.   Best of luck to both of you.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is plenty old enough to understand you did the best you could under the circumstances you were handed. She was fed, clothed, cared for and educated. Above all, she was loved. By you. \n\nStop apologizing to her. It\u2019s sad that all she remembers of her childhood is going without material things growing up, not your sacrifices or the fun times you had, even on a shoe string budget. At 28 years old, one would think she would have more perspective- there are children out there who have far less than she ever had growing up, that being jealous over her younger siblings is ridiculous. At this point in your lives, she should be happy that she gets to share your success now that you\u2019re thriving and in a position to enjoy life more.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NAH. \n\nIn another comment, you say that CJ is in therapy, which is good for her. I think it would be worth it for you to do family therapy as well. \n\nCJ's feelings about her upbringing are clearly different than yours. She's having a hard time dealing with them. On one hand, she's \"old enough to know better\", but on the other hand, it's probably very difficult for her to have those feelings when she's constantly reminded that her siblings have more than she did, in so many ways. They have a father and a mother who are both loving, capable, giving parents. I don't think it's fair to call her an AH when she's dealing with unresolved trauma.", "NAH\u2026 But, at that dinner when she said that\u2026 man, I would\u2019ve gone and given her a big hug and really acknowledged how much of a struggle it was just to get by. Yes, in front of everyone. Yes, even though she was inappropriate. \n\nShe grew up in that. If you didn\u2019t experience that poverty until later in your life, that\u2019s a totally different thing. And you\u2019re older. So, even though you\u2019re moving on with life- she may only be starting to grasp how those experiences shaped her. She\u2019s perhaps only beginning to understand what she missed out on and how different her life may have been with more opportunities. That\u2019s a challenge no matter what. But, watching that kind of life unfold for her siblings, is going to hit different. \n\nShe\u2019s going to need time to process and mature. I don\u2019t think you need to endlessly apologize so much as you need to make sure you stay connected to her experience and your unique relationship. \n\nDefinitely let her know that it\u2019s not okay for her to use your history as a weapon to hurt you, but that you\u2019re always okay with listening and working through it together. And just keep showing up! Therapy together might be really beneficial. It\u2019s a lot to unpack!", "NTA. As a 28 year old woman, I could not imagine A. Harping on my poor mom, who literally did everything she could to make sure I was sheltered, fed, etc. And B. Being jealous of a child to the point that I'm willing to try and ruin their birthday. \n\nI could understand her sitting you down, explaining that it hurts, allowing you both an opportunity to discuss it and for her to get some healing. But her attitude of \"I can bring it up whenever I want.\" is unacceptable. She can be petty and nasty all she wants, but that doesn't mean that people have to tolerate it. She is a fully grown adult and she needs to act like it before she alienates herself from everyone.", "NAH\n\nBut maybe don\u2019t include her on those flashy kid events, but rather celebrate with a meal at home, together.\n\nAnd therapy. Keep in mind that growing up in poverty constitutes an entire childhood of trauma.", "NAH and dont listen to advice from reddit concerning this, growing up poor myself, never having anything and also coming from a broken home.\n\nYou have to understand, if you dont already that it's not neccesarily about her not understanding it all, but depending on how you're treated by your peers just for being poor it can be rough.\n\nI think the hard part for your daugther right now is seeing you giving your children everything she ever longed for in her childhood and couldn't have, you were probably stretched out thin during that time as well.\n\nthe only thing that can fix this is long conversations about the past, which also includes you acknowledging the same complaint she always had, because that seems to be something that she has been carrying around for a long time, she seeing your children grow up and have a happy childhood must hurt her a lot because she is constantly comparing it to her childhood which causes a lot of trauma to resurface.", "It\u2019s hard to not to resent your situation, if you were in CJ\u2019s position. Imagine comparing against your peers but you can\u2019t help but be born to your parents and hence socioeconomic background. And there is some solace in that. \n\nBut now, you have these siblings who have all that you wanted - a nice, nuclear family with both parents who hold steady jobs and want for nothing. You understand your mother was put in a hard position but so were you\u2014 and this wasn\u2019t out of anything you could have controlled. Your mother made some hard choices but she had those choices. You were ultimately a child subjected to them. \n\nYes, her siblings would never need to know struggle and that\u2019s a good thing but also, it will always be a stark reminder of what she lacked. Because this is what she could have had, in an alternate reality where things were kinder to you, and therefore, kinder to her. \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s a very, very sympathetic ESH here because growing up poor is traumatising. You learn to minimise your wants and needs because you know how hard it is for your parent(s) to earn money. You spend as little as possible to not be a burden and you also try to not cause too much trouble and take up your parent(s)\u2019 attention because their time could be better spent working/relaxing. And even when the situation gets better financially, it takes time and effort to unlearn that. \n\nSo she\u2019s older and she needs to reconcile the fact life is unfair but she\u2019s not able to and she\u2019s taking it out on the family. But also? I\u2019m not seeing any real work you\u2019ve tried to put in to help her. All you talk about is trying to make things \u201ceven\u201d (they can never be!) but nothing about helping her. She may be an adult but you will always be her parent and parenthood takes a lot more than just throwing money at your problems. \n\nAlso put yourself in her shoes for a bit. She goes to college and you meet your husband and start this do-over family without her. I\u2019m not saying you did by the way, I\u2019m just saying this might be what it looks like. That you have this perfect family while she was away. I\u2019m not saying your daughter feels this way, I\u2019m just sharing what I know a friend personally felt in a similar situation: that this only really reinforced her belief that she was dragging her mother down, because look! Her mother\u2019s life is suddenly picture perfect without her around!\n\nThere are problems here that I think you both need to work on together. And yes, some feelings are ugly but please, you need to allow room for them. I personally think telling her that essentially needs to shut up about her childhood because that spoils the mood was in bad taste. Think about your word choice. That she \u201cthrew\u201d her lived experience \u201cin your face\u201d. Is she supposed to shut up entirely then? To appease you? Because you don\u2019t want to have to \u201ckeep apologising\u201d? Because from what you\u2019ve said\u2014 you aren\u2019t framing it that you\u2019re mad that she\u2019s taking it out on the family. You are mad that she reminded you that you failed her and are continuing to fail her. \n\nYou are much kinder to yourself than you are kind to her. And you both need all the kindness that you can get. It\u2019s clear you both love one another and keep trying to make your relationship work, so please. Keep working at it. I really hope the best for you both, as individuals and as mother and daughter.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou have to put yourself in your daughter\u2019s shoes growing up. While you did all you could, I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t know the extent of the struggles she had growing up, emotionally and psychologically, caused by financial instability. The helplessness she felt. On top of that, you were probably stressed all the time. And it would have impacted how you related to each other as mother and daughter. And now, she sees you with your new family all being happy celebrating and taking trips, especially since you invite her to them. Has she said no? Did you insist she come? \n\nThe huge differences in her and her siblings childhood are being rubbed in her face over and over again. I mean, her building resentment is understandable. \n\nShe needs therapy for this. She has all that baggage she had to work on. And you dismissing her feelings on it, didn\u2019t help. It probably even added to her idea of you started all over w/ a new family with a clean slate that she\u2019s no longer part of.\n\nWork with her or you\u2019ll lose her to resentment. And to the people saying she\u2019s 28, she should get over it by now. You don\u2019t know how financial instability shapes a child\u2019s mind. I\u2019ve had that growing up and it gave me general anxieties that I only put a name on when I\u2019m in my 30s. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It\u2019s understandable why she feels jealousy over the fact that her younger siblings are getting to grow up wealthier than she did, but it sounds like you\u2019ve been understanding and validating these feelings. It sounds like you did your best in a tough situation and have made a better life now for all three of your children. If she hasn\u2019t already, CJ should consider trying to work through these feelings of resentment in therapy before they get in the way of her relationship with her mother and younger siblings.", "NAH \n\n  Is she bullying your kids or calling them spoiled? Is she demanding you apologise? If not, I think it's ok both for her to bring up the disparaties sometimes and for you not to apologise. Do you talk about childhood moments with her with your other kids? Even positive ones? There's likely going to be significant social and cultural differences between her and your younger children for the rest of their lives. Make sure you're not giving her the impression that your life together is something you're trying to forget and move on from.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I see why she feels the way she does, as I\u2019m sure you do. I\u2019ve been in her shoes and my god does it suck. But there comes a point when you just have to accept that your childhood is what it is and you move on from it. CJ isn\u2019t that much younger than me, and I definitely had made peace with my feelings towards my parents and younger siblings and their comparatively better upbringing by the time I was 28. I don\u2019t know what she expects from you, and it doesn\u2019t seem like she does either. All I can say with certainty is that it seems like you did the best you could at all times and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad for the fact that the best you can do now is better than the best you could do when she was younger.", "Probably an unpopular take but soft YTA. You say CJ is always invited to things with your husband and younger kids. What do you do that\u2019s just for you and CJ? She probably feels like an afterthought because those are things she missed out on as a kid that she\u2019s now \u201ctagging along with\u201d now. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to give better experiences to your youngests, you should be able to do something special for her. If you can do all that for a birthday for your younger kid, you can do a special something for CJ for her birthday that maybe doesn\u2019t turn into a whole family trip, so that she feels special and gets a unique experience with you.\n\nAlso you can start making it up to her to even it out. You said she has a fianc\u00e9? Contribute to her wedding or honeymoon so she gets a better experience than she might have expected. There are things you can do and saying that you can\u2019t ever even it out is a complete cop out. Your 5 and 6 year old don\u2019t need a special vacation every year. You can find ways to help balance this out but it seems like at this point, you\u2019ve written off your adult daughter for your new family.", "I think NAH.\n\nI just think you have an eldest child whose dealing with childhood trauma, which could be from growing up poor, to you possibly being spread to thin as a parent to offer the support her siblings are able to get during important moments she maybe hasn't had the ability to express yet, to the lack of having her father in her life, etc. I can't say without knowing her side. \nI know as a kid who grew up poor, knew the fears of no food or housing, and had a mom who worked all the time that it impacted me, and It comes up in weird ways. I once got mad when my partner drove me by his family home because it was nice and beautiful and I never got that. I once saw my 35 year old sister break down crying cause my younger brother and I got to go on a trip, and it wasn't because she couldn't go then but because she never got that from our dad as a child.\n\nAlso, though of course it's not your fault, she may realize that your other children will always have a better running start in life than she had and that's a painful pill to swallow, especially when you see it unfolding in front of you.\n\nEven though she's an adult, we all have an inner child that needs soothing and healing and she's obviously still working on that. Again, I don't know all sides but family therapy, doing more to incorporate her into your new family, and even letting her vent more about this could help even if it feels like a hard thing to do. I also think it's important that your younger children know that their older sister may struggle to see them get so many nice things because she didn't, and it can teach them to learn about how the world works and why kindness and humility are so important, plus it's a part of being a family. Other than that, I hope you two find a healthy conclusion so that you're whole family can come together and find happiness with each other.", "NTA. I had a very similar upbringing, except both my dad and my mom went on to either have more kids they could spoil, or became very stable/wealthy after I was an independent adult.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I did resent my mom (my primary caretaker) for constantly moving us around and failing to provide a comfortable life for us. I also resented my dad for moving out of state and basically starting a new family. \n\nBut as I got older and realized how hard/unfair life is, I came to the conclusion that they were both just doing their best. I also realize how absolutely selfish it is to think that my father wasn\u2019t allowed to have a life without me. \n\nIt is 0% their fault for finally climbing themselves out of poverty after it could benefit me, or for continuing their lives after me\n\nNow, Im glad they\u2019re able to spoil their current kids, and I\u2019m glad  they can feel a little better about themselves by giving my siblings a better future. I\u2019m also happy they are just struggling less in general; no one should have to fight tooth and nail to live a relatively stable life. \n\nSpending any kind of time being jealous that they\u2019re better off now is just a toxic drain on my own life. \n\nI hope your daughter is able to make the same conclusion soon. You seem like you genuinely care about your daughter, and it would be a shame for her to miss out on the love you very clearly have for her \n\nI think just give it some time. She may still have a little growing to do", "NTA....BUT \nHer feelings are valid. I grew up with young/ incredibly emotionally underdeveloped parents.\nMy dad also basically got to start living life when I was 17 as I was out of the house and his job was better. \nWatching my little brothers get the dad I never had, schooling, luxuries, etc. is very bittersweet. It definitely feels like they are his 'real' family most days. \n\nHowever, it is completely inappropriate for her to lash out in front of her siblings. I have never once spoken to my siblings about my upbringing. They haven't got a single clue things are different. They would feel guilt and I don't ever want to cause them hurt. She needs to think about their feelings instead of her unresolved emotions.\n\nShe needs therapy, and if you would be willing to attend with her it would probably help a lot more. Her feelings likely go deeper than vacations and material objects. She might also hold resentment for things she was exposed to or how you handled certain parenting situations as a young/single mom. Ultimately it is up to her to accept it and move forward. She has it better than a lot, as it seems you do go out of your way to include her in the more comfortable lifestyle you have worked hard for. \n\nIn my family if you make things uncomfortable you don't participate. Maybe discuss (during therapy) that her behavior is effecting the family as a whole and if she can't control her emotions she doesn't need to participate.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, OP. You seem to be trying your best, and there's no handbook for life.", "NTA. You did a great job managing to keep a roof over CJ's head and food in her mouth while she was growing up. You need to stop feeling bad about her upbringing and stop telling her how sorry you are for that. You have nothing to feel sorry about. \n\nThe next time she brings this up suggest she talks to a therapist to work through her childhood issues. Remind her that you are not a therapist and she needs to figure out how to be at peace with her childhood and grow up. Say it every single time she starts talking crap.", "NTA. At 28 years old, your daughter needs to grow TF up. Time for a serious sit-down with her about the realities of your life, what you did to keep her fed, housed and clothed. Tell her you understand that if she were a child her jealousy would be understandable, but as an adult herself, she needs to accept that you did what you could and that now you are in a position to provide more for everyone, including her. I would honestly tell her that if she cannot get over this and be supportive and accepting, you can\u2019t invite her when she is so negative. You both should be celebrating your success!", "NTA. CJ is jealous, and it's not a good look. You did your best. I for one am very proud of you xxxx", "NTA. Her feelings are understandable, because it was not her fault her upbringing sucked but it was not yours either. She needs to understand how you broke your back trying to give her the best life you could, its not like you denied her luxuries on purpose. To guilt trip you and try and make your younger kids feel bad about it is very immature.  \n\nShe is clearly still hurt from the struggles of the past. Your daughter needs therapy to help her move on from her difficult childhood so she can enjoy her current life.", "No you're NTA\n\nAs you've pointed out, its unfortunate that that CJ and yourself lived near poverty - but it sounds like you did everything possible to be a good mother.  I think the way you've approached it since you've become financially better off and re-married etc has been good.\n\nCJ doesn't have to get over it but she should try to be understanding and shouldn't be throwing it in your face every chance she gets.  CJ is definitely old enough now to know how the world works and that you did the best you can.  Is she in therapy? If not maybe she should be.", "NTA, you did the best you could in the circumstances and technically CJ got a Barbie and got to see Frozen with her fiance.", "NTA.  You did the best you could with the money you had.  It's not like you had lots of extra money and spent it all on yourself while making your daughter go without.  What exactly does she expect, that you can rewrite the past and not be poor during her childhood?  I'm sorry, but she seems immature and bitter, and I think family therapy is needed to get past this.\n\nI come from a background with lots of material goods and privileges, but a very mentally ill and abusive mother (divorced).   I would gladly have traded a loving, supportive, emotionally stable mother who was poor for my life of wealth, abuse and neglect.  Your daughter did NOT get the short end of the stick.  You do NOT need to keep apologizing.", "NTA.  Let CJ know you love her but she needs to get some therapy for her feelings because you cannot change history and she cannot keep seething on the past.  Let her know if she doesn't then you will have to limit contact because you want to move forward with her in a good way, but you will move forward without her if she doesn't work with you for a better relationship.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t like you were living the sweet life as she starved, you struggled together, you loved your daughter and did the best you could. This SHOULD be a special bond that you two share, instead she is being resentful and nasty. \n\nHer behavior is unacceptable and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it for a second, and neither should you.", "NTA.  You should not have apologized for CJ's childhood.  You had a very challenging situation, yet you were successful in the end.  That's an incredible accomplishment and you should be proud of it.  Even though it was hard, CJ should be proud of it too.\n\nSo what to do now?  CJ's grudge isn't healthy for her.  Really she should get counseling to help understand her anger.  But I don't know how successful you're going to be if you suggest that.  Perhaps the best approach is to tell her that you love her, you did the best you could with what you had, and while it was hard, it is not acceptable for her to keep attacking you in this way (because she is attacking you).  It may take some time, but ultimately she'll realize she's not doing anyone a favor with her behavior.  Good luck.", "NTA. You seem to be doing the best you can for all of your children. Your best might have looked different and involved limited resources during CJ\u2019s childhood, but it was your best. \n\nIt might be something worth being to family counseling, though. There seems to be a lot of underlying hurt. Poverty can be a complex trauma in itself and it may be something CJ needs to keep processing as an adult. Or maybe this is something else that CJ is projecting onto the material items. None of this is your fault - like I said, you did the best you could and I can tell you love your daughter. Maybe doing your best for each other now involves some professional intervention and organized processing.", "NTA. I'm 28 years old, and the oldest of two siblings. I was afforded absolutely nothing growing up, barring one school year that I was permitted to go to the after school program hosted by my middle school. My younger brother (now 19) got everything. Time with our dad (his father, my stepfather) at the gun range, going out to play DnD with the adults, privileges and extracurriculars I could never dream of. I wasn't a bad kid, just not the favorite. My mother and I have had a lot of discussions about it in the past year, and I'm finally at peace- as much as I can be. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter may be holding onto a lot of bitterness. I recognize the financial burden you had- and entirely understand why lived the way you did. Money doesn't grow on trees. However it's possible that she doesn't fully understand why there's a difference between how the kids are being raised vs how she was. You may want to try and talk with her about it, see if you can find the root of it and go from there.  However, her telling your son what she did was unkind and unacceptable.", "NTA.

I also realize how absolutely selfish it is to think that my father wasn\u2019t allowed to have a life without me. \n\nIt is 0% their fault for finally climbing themselves out of poverty after it could benefit me, or for continuing their lives after me\n\nNow, Im glad they\u2019re able to spoil their current kids, and I\u2019m glad  they can feel a little better about themselves by giving my siblings a better future. I\u2019m also happy they are just struggling less in general; no one should have to fight tooth and nail to live a relatively stable life. \n\nSpending any kind of time being jealous that they\u2019re better off now is just a toxic drain on my own life. \n\nI hope your daughter is able to make the same conclusion soon. You seem like you genuinely care about your daughter, and it would be a shame for her to miss out on the love you very clearly have for her \n\nI think just give it some time. She may still have a little growing to do\n\nEdit: and to your point about constantly apologizing, no. It isnt fair of her to expect you to be frozen in time, perpetually feeling awful that her life was a little hard. You acknowledged that you didnt give her the life she deserved, but you also were doing your best. She knows this. Continuing to say sorry isn\u2019t going to reverse time and undo it", "NTA. You did your best as a young, struggling single parent. You pushed through and slowly but surely improved your life. I'm proud of you for that, and your daughter needs to come to terms with this all as well. You. Did. Your. Best.  And you still are under new circumstances! I commend you for always including her, but stop apologizing for something you worked hard on. Be proud of where you are, and it's time to let any guilt go.", "ESH I get both sides. Your daughter definitely has jealous feelings which is valid. You were a single mom and did what you could. Just keep talking healthy about it.

As in, we didn\u2019t even have a bathroom and shower in my home poor. Slowly my parents started gaining wealth and thank god by the time I was a teen they were actually quite wealthy. \nMy brothers got a lot more as kids than me (I\u2019m the oldest by quite a lot). I would never blame my parents or throw shade that they managed to grow out of extreme poverty and make a good living. \n\nYour daughter sounds like a complete ungrateful asshole.

Your daughter's feelings are very understandable but at her age she 100 percent should know that siblings with age gaps don't always get the same material conditions growing up.

Sounds like she has some therapy or internal work to do to come to terms with her upbringing (which doesn\u2019t sound all that awful to be honest). You\u2019re approaching it just as you should: being empathetic and understanding, but realizing that you can\u2019t change the past.

It sounds like you're just inviting your daughter along when you're already doing these activities with your new family which she has never truly been a part of (living together). I think to show your daughter you really care about her you need to do something with her, just for her. Not with your other kids. Maybe go on a vacation where you only bring her.

You're doing what parents are supposed to do - the best you can with what you've got. You just happen to have more now than you did then,  as is true for most people. It's it fair? No, but life rarely is.\n\nYour daughter is nearly 30 years old and I can't quite justify her being upset that you were broke then but aren't now. If you'd abused her or neglected her,  then I could understand but all of her complaints are materialistic and childish. \n\nI would encourage you to try and talk through this on a deeper level though. At 17 it's difficult to be an engaged parent. It's even harder when you're single,  and more so when you're working AND trying to get an education to improve your circumstances. It's possible this isn't really about material things so much as how different you are as a parent and it's just easier to put a name to the obvious material items.", "NTA.

There are ways to express being hurt and upset that don\u2019t seek to hurt others.", "Absolutely NTA.  CJ needs to mature and learn how to move forward.

You did the best you could, be proud of what you did provide and how far you have come.  Stipulations would be made if it were me.  Only invites if she agrees to be mature.  Not fair to you or her siblings to being that energy in.  And honestly it is very toxic and unhealthy for her.", "NTA.  You did the best that you could with what you had at the time.  Your daughter had food, a home, a mother who loves and cares for her. Sounds like a decent upbrining to me even without the materialistic things and holidays.  A lot of children don't get any of that, the love and care, the home, the food. Sounds like your daughter needs to get some help because she doesn't realise how lucky she is.  No you don't have to keep apologising.

You can't always choose your circumstances, but what you do within them and how you respond to them.\n\nI am sorry to say this, but your daughter seems to have a superficial worldview. That the true value of things is measured by their cost. The worst thing is that you can't explain it to her - it will look as if you are trying to defend yourself. Hopefully she will understand as she matures.\n\nIn our society there is so much focus on money and what they can buy. But children really wants their parents presence over their presents - probably both if they can.

Her father did not stick around and we really struggled for a bit. Even when I graduated college, I had a bunch of student loan debt as well as juggling rent, food and other expenses. CJ never lacked necessities, but I admit she didn't get a lot of material possesions. I would try to save up as much as possible to make Christmas and birthdays as fun as possible, but she didn't get much else throughout the year and we only went on 2 vacations. We definitely ate a lot of struggle meals and had to move often. We honestly teetered on the poverty line.\n\nWhen CJ was 17, I was finally debt free, got a promotion at work and was doing much better. I did start to give her things throughout the year. I used my bonus to take her to Disney World-somewhere she always wanted to go but couldn't. It was nice that after years of struggling, I could spoil her a little.\n\nShe went off to college and in this time, I met my husband \"Matthew\". We got married and now have 2 kids together, \"Jack\" (5M) and \"Melissa\" (6F). With our combined incomes, we live quite comfortably. I admit, Jack and Melissa have gotten a lot more than CJ did at that age. I've certainly never left her out. She's always invited on our trips (we pay), I get her random gifts throughout the year, birthdays and Christmases are bigger. I'm trying to make it as even as I can, but I know it realistically never will be. \n\nCJ first pointed out the discrepancy a couple of years ago we took the kids to Disney (CJ went with us). I sat CJ down and apologized for her childhood. I said I wish I had been in a better place when she was their age, I know I can never truly make up for it, etc. I said I know it'll take time for her to heal from that. \n\nI thought that was it, but since then, CJ has constantly complained whenever her siblings get anything. I'm always super sensitive to her feelings, validate them etc. But things came to a head recently, on Jack's birthday. Instead of a party, he opted to see the off-broadway production of Frozen. We as always, invited CJ to come along, as well as her fiance. The whole night, she was pouting and seemed upset. I tried talking to her but she brushed it off. We went to dinner after the show. Jack and Melissa were excitedly talking about it. CJ then butted in \"You know what I got for my 5th birthday, Jack? A Barbie from the dollar store.\"\n\nThe kids didn't really see the big deal, but the adults at the table understood. I was civil the rest of the meal but later called CJ and told her what she did was unacceptable. I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so. I said I was disappointed and hung up. Later, CJ sent me a very long text, telling me I was a horrible mother. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I couldn't participate in after school activities because I had to take care of my brother. When we were older and I was able to play a sport my mother never came to games because she was working all the time.\n\nI lived in 21 different states before I was 16, and that's not including all the times we moved locally. As an adult, I have trouble forming attachments and if I don't move once a year I get incredibly anxious.\n\nMy mom and stepdad adopted four kids (siblings) when me, my brother, and stepsister were grown and were, for the most part, able to provide better for them than they did for us and while I might have rolled my eyes when they got away with things I would have been yelled at for, I never resented them or my parents because our experiences were different. \n\nYour daughter definitely has issues but she sounds like one of those ppl who thinks because she suffered everyone else should have to suffer as well, to be \"fair\".\n\n I'd stop apologizing and tell her life isn't fair, you did the best you could and she needs to work on her issues in therapy and leave your kids out of it. I'd also stop inviting her to things. She's not appreciative, and it sounds like she just goes so she can complain and bring everyone down.", "NTA and suggest therapy. Infact I\u2019d suggest some therapy for you to just help give you some ideas on how best to deal with CJ\u2019s resentment.", "NTA.\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I have no personal way of understanding what CJ went through. Money was never an issue for my family growing up (at least as far as I know), and I can't think of any significant difference in how my parents treated me v. how they treated my younger siblings. \n\nI initially thought about voting NAH. However:\n\n1) OP mentions that she was able to start taking steps to improve her and CJ's overall quality of life when CJ was 17, and CJ is 28 at the time of this post. I know that overcoming trauma isn't really something that you can put a deadline on, but after 11 years, shouldn't CJ at least be able to understand that her mother did the best she could given the circumstances?\n\n2) \"I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so.\"\n\nHow much more is OP supposed to do to atone? As others have pointed out, there is certainly more that OP can and should do to help CJ overcome her trauma, and it looks like OP is definitely willing to put in the effort to do that. But at the risk of sounding insensitive, is CJ going to be bitter about her trauma and OP's shortcomings for the rest of both their lives?\n\n3) CJ's barb toward Jack at the birthday dinner and her complete lack of remorse when OP called her out (plus the fact that she doubled down further afterward) was what pushed my vote past NAH and into NTA. As I said in my first point, it's not right to place a deadline on when CJ should be over her trauma. But using said trauma as an excuse to hurt other people is what makes her TA.", "I don\u2019t think she should take out her resentment on her siblings but it\u2019s like a slap in the face to cj. Yes she\u2019s grown but people take all kinds of things from their childhood. Their good or bad experiences will mold them for better or worse. Obviously growing up while struggling isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world but it can have some lasting effects. For me I grew up struggling so I\u2019m not going to have kids until I\u2019m financially secure so my child won\u2019t have to struggle the same way I did. I feel since none of us ask to be here, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to make sure all our needs and wants are met because again we are born out of our parents selfish desire to have unprotected sex and procreate. So maybe for cj she feels it\u2019s not fair to have her while you struggled. She probably feels it wasn\u2019t fair that you didn\u2019t wait until you were secure like with the other kids. Seeing you do things for them she wished you could of did for her just reminds her of how much she wanted but couldn\u2019t have. To see  a 6 year old who, can\u2019t even appreciate the value of the things he getting while she had to settle for dollar store Barbie at his age is wild to her. And that\u2019s valid. However her anger is misplaced. She shouldn\u2019t be mad at her siblings. Just her parents if she wants to be mad at anything cause they put her in the situation she grew up in. You aren\u2019t an A but she just needs to get all her anger and resentment out on you one day and just let it go after that.

Which are MUCH appreciated. But I wonder if you have 1:1 time now?  She\u2019s seeing you at an expensive birthday she never got, which stings, but more than that, I think the one thing she valued above material items was your bond and that\u2019s not as strong anymore. I think she\u2019s jealous, but the monetary items are easier to grab onto. \n\nHonestly, you both sort of grew up together. You were kids at the same time for a while. I think you have a cool opportunity to be adults together now. I wish my mom and I could have transitioned to adult friends instead of just a mom and daughter who loved each other. I wish I could have gotten her tipsy more and talked to her about shit like a peer and been unguarded in  the way you are with your bff. I really think what she wants is the closeness and the intimacy you shared when you were a family of 2. Invite her to brunch or a girls weekend or have a regular nail appointment.

It does seem like she is resentful of ur new family. Possibly (if u don't already) don't just include her in ur new family activities. Do some activities with just her as well.

It sounds like CJ had a loving parent and access to all the basics. That alone is more than a vast number of people get. \n\nHer anger is not only damaging her relationships (including with her sibs) but is damaging *her.* OP is right to pull her up short finally, but I second the idea that some counseling (solo certainly, maybe also joint) would be helpful.", "Talk with her and explain you\u2019ll do nice things for the kids, but they might be triggering for her and give her the option. \n\nOr maybe have a few do-over birthdays for her.", "Interesting you call your middle child your eldest, it makes it feel like even you consider her 'outside' your 'actual' family. She probably can feel that (and on top of the disparity in childhood experiences) it is causing her to lash out. Are there ways she can be more included in family events and activities with the children, or one on one with you and your husband so she feels more part of the family? Remember it was once only you and her against the world - and now you have a husband and two small ones and she feels understandably replaced and jealous of the difference in childhood experiences.\n\nDefinitely needs therapy", "Fair enough. I do say things like this to my kids sometimes (similar ages to your younger ones) and I'm not resentful at all. I just don't want them growing up entitled. I'm also glad not to be a materialistic or status-seeking person myself and I'd like that for them too as adults. But if it will feel like resentment to the kids themselves (and not coloured by any of your imo misplaced guilt) that's not ok.", "For me it's the fact that her daughter was around 26? When she sat her down about her childhood being different compared to her other kids. I get she shouldn't be bending over backwards but she waited a long time into adulthood to talk one on one about it. Yes adult daughter should be able to talk about it in a healthier way. The mom mentioned \"giving it time\" well she spent 17 years not getting what her siblings receive now, how can you expect a few years to go by compared to the 17 and be fully \"healed\"", "I mean it\u2019s gotta hurt to see mom spoil her new kids with extravagant birthday parties when she got a dollar store Barbie. Im not saying she\u2019s right in continuously throwing it in her moms face, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a magic solution but I would probably feel hurt too if a five year old got a trip to an off Broadway show compared to what I got.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a magic solution but your daughter is clearly hurt. Talk to her and figure out a way to help make it right. I genuinely think it sucks for both of you.", "Don\u2019t listen to this person, they\u2019re very clearly bitter about their own circumstances. \n\nIt sounds like you did the best you could, and anyone with half a brain knows that having a kid at a bad time is very rarely an easy decision, or even a real decision at all. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to apologize that life finally swung your way. If you still love your daughter, still try to be in her life, and still treat her with kindness and respect, you are doing everything right. She just needs to grow up", "Don't listen to this asshole. You did the best you possibly could with what little you had. Your daughter is obviously very envious of her siblings, but that doesn't give her the right to treat you like crap just because you're finally not living on the edge of poverty anymore. You already apologized and have continued to include her on your success ladder by sharing when you've had something TO share. You can't tell me that she never saw your struggle and sacrifice to make sure that she was taken care of as she grew up, but she wants to act like you didn't do enough?....over things.  It sucks that she grew up in a poor household, but life's not fair, and she's not entitled to things that you literally couldn't afford to give. What exactly is she expecting to happen? That every time you give somebody a gift, she gets a gift too? Does she want you to hold a party wherein you give her a gift for every birthday and Christmas that she didn't get what she wanted? We don't get reparations for a crappy childhood. She needs to stop acting like a toddler and accept the cards that she was dealt, but that's easier said than done. I really think she needs to discuss this with a therapist because she's starting to take her anger out on you, and to a lesser extent, her siblings. She's the only one who can manage her emotions about the situation.", "I agree with you and I'm not suggesting the level of resentment that seems present from CJ is healthy in any way. There seems to be a lot of resentment that should have been dealt with years ago. \n\nI would imagine you know kids often lash out at the \"safe\" parent, but that usually happens at a younger age; I'm just suggesting that perhaps rather than her directing that at her father when she was younger, it's coming out and getting dumped on mom now. For anyone who deals with childhood trauma, it can come in waves. If she didn't have access to counselling as a child or as a teen, it's not shocking that she's still holding on to some of this. None of that makes her dumping on her mom ok and mom is absolutely NTA. \n\nWhile the anger and resentment is not appropriate and is misplaced, I would personally say it's valid, though the way she's handling it is not. It's unresolved trauma and it's certainly her responsibility as an adult to try and access the tools to help resolve and come to terms with it so she can be her best self. It's not at all appropriate or healthy based on what's here for her to be *blaming* her parents or expecting continued apologies from a mother who did all she could to provide for her daughter.", "She's gotten quite a few do-over birthdays in the 11 years since I started doing better financially.\n\nAnd she always has the option to come or not. It's not like I say she has to come.", "I think OP meant she didn't consider stopping making events for her eldest, CJ, for fear that it'd trigger her. I don't read it as her saying her middle is the eldest.", "That still doesn't explain how the mom is throwing it in CJs face. Is she supposed to not do anything for her younger kids to equalize it? I understand it hurts, but mom isn't doing anything wrong by living a life that she worked her ass of for. Especially when she includes CJ in seemingly everything and takes time to treat her to special outings and gifts specifically geared to her.", "Having a kid at a bad time isn't an easy decision but it is a decision you make compared to other options like abortion and adoption. And the reason its a hard decision is because of your bad actions and decisions. \n\nYou owe it to your kids to start them off in a good direction.", "Did the best you could isn't good enough when she purposely had a child she couldn't give a good life to. Life's not fair because OP chose to put her daughter in a bad upbringing. She clearly chose differently for her replacement kids.", "Great point about dumping on mom because mom is safe (and there)! You are absolutely right. And I suppose it\u2019s a good reminder that I shouldn\u2019t judge others\u2019 level of trauma - it\u2019s fair to judge actions but not feelings.", "I think right here is why she might still be bringing it up to you. Those first 17 years of her life impacted her long term. She might feel like this forever. It's not your fault you were a single mom struggling but it's also not her fault that she grew up that way.", "> Especially when she includes CJ in seemingly everything and takes time to treat her to special outings and gifts specifically geared to her.\n\nDefinitely this!", "And she did by providing a wonderful example of what a responsible parent does for their kid: prioritizing their basic need, providing love, providing a first hand example of self development and accountability. That is SO much more than what the vast majority of people can say. Sure growing up with not that much stuff can make some people feel less than. But let's be real. Being materialistic isn't a good quality, and OP gave her daughter a great hand to thrive in life. It's people like you that make her feel that she got less than she deserves, and that's what sucks.", "Have you ever had an abortion?", "It's not me. CJ clearly did not enjoy having an impoverished childhood. We're talking poverty here and vast differences in childhood wealth due to her mother's decisions. That's not being materialistic.\n\nA responsible parent has their kids when they're in a good place to do so, which OP did not.", "No\nAnd I'm not saying that it's an easy choice just like adoption either. But you don't get to give a kid a shitty life and then shrug your shoulders and say \"oh well i tried\"\n\nOP made a bunch of bad choices that have lasting affects for CJ. OP has to deal with the consequences of her choices.", "CJ didn't seem to have an issue with it until she saw what her half siblings are getting now which is pretty typical of siblings until a certain age. It's a lesson to learn that things can never be truly equal. Your definition of a good spot to be a parent is just much higher than what most people would consider, and it reeks of classism. You are effectively saying that if you can only provide a dollar store doll for your kids' birthday and have to provide struggle meals at times, you shouldn't have a kid. Fortunately the government doesn't think like you, because a lot of people like me would have been deprived of a happy although frugal childhood, and loving parents that made us thriving individuals.", "So your options are to have an abortion, carry a baby to term and then put them up for adoption (very likely guaranteeing them a crappy life anyway), or having a kid at a not ideal time, and you think picking any one of them is a good or better decision? \n\nAnd she isn\u2019t shrugging anything off, she very clearly is making an effort to help her kid feel loved, included, and supported. She isn\u2019t just saying sorry, she is apologizing with words AND actions. What else would you like her to do, slit her wrists open and die apologizing with her last breath?\n\nThere\u2019s a point in life where you either forgive someone or you don\u2019t. And if you can\u2019t, even after they try with their whole being to make it up to you, that\u2019s a you problem. And it\u2019s valid. Generally speaking, I\u2019d say remove that person from your life. Go your separate ways\n\nBut when it\u2019s your mother, that\u2019s easier said than done. So you either need to self reflect and find some forgiveness in your heart, or you need to understand that this resentment you\u2019re carrying will ruin both of your lives \n\nHer daughter needs to make THAT hard decision.", "Yea, if your kid will be impoverished, then you shouldn't have them.\n\nOf course CJ is mad. Her mother was capable of making better reproductive choices all along, but she chose not to for her life.", "The options are really to make better decisions in the first place.\nOnce that ship has sailed, yea you're gonna have a hard decision to make. Because you made bad decisions to get there. You either have an abortion, pick new parents to give the baby to, or parent. All come with their baggage.\n\nThere's nothing left for OP to do but keep making it up to her daughter. Because she's the one who screwed her daughter over by giving her a crappy life when OP knew good and well it would be a struggle. That's why OP is TA. And CJ is fully entitled to her anger over the situation.", "Your argument is so out of touch with reality. Are you CJ? In concrete terms, CJ will have to either accept the fact that OP's choice was indeed either not to have her, or to wish her good luck with foster/adoptive parents in the horrendous system we all know, or to raise her without luxury. Because let's be real, CJ is pouting about birthday gifts, she's not pouting about real life consequences that she could have been suffering from, such as developmental problems linked to malnutrition or what not, had she truly grown up in dire poverty. You are judging OP for poor reproductive decision making as if she had raised CJ in a situation of child abuse, which she absolutely did not. CJ is acting entitled, and that is truly the mark of someone who did not lack from that much growing up.", "What is the better decision? You clearly think there is one so please explain. All of humanity would like to know, because this has been an issue since meiosis.", "Don't fuck as an irresponsible teenager? \nDon't keep kid you can't raise with a good quality of life? \n\nThese are very achievable choices."]}
