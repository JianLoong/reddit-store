{"id": 11836, "submission_id": "11mi7av", "title": "AITA for not wanting to apologize over and over again for my daughter's upbringing?", "selftext": "I (45F) had my daughter, CJ (now 28F) when I was 17 years old. Her father did not stick around and we really struggled for a bit. Even when I graduated college, I had a bunch of student loan debt as well as juggling rent, food and other expenses. CJ never lacked necessities, but I admit she didn't get a lot of material possesions. I would try to save up as much as possible to make Christmas and birthdays as fun as possible, but she didn't get much else throughout the year and we only went on 2 vacations total in her childhood. We definitely ate a lot of struggle meals and had to move often. We honestly teetered on the poverty line.\n\nWhen CJ was 17, I was finally debt free, got a promotion at work and was doing much better. I did start to give her things throughout the year. I used my bonus to take her to Disney World-somewhere she always wanted to go but couldn't. It was nice that after years of struggling, I could spoil her a little.\n\nShe went off to college and in this time, I met my husband \"Matthew\". We got married and now have 2 kids together, \"Jack\" (5M) and \"Melissa\" (6F). With our combined incomes, we live quite comfortably. I admit, Jack and Melissa have gotten a lot more than CJ did at that age. I've certainly never left her out. She's always invited on our trips (we pay), I get her random gifts throughout the year, birthdays and Christmases are bigger. I'm trying to make it as even as I can, but I know it realistically never will be.\n\nCJ first pointed out the discrepancy a couple of years ago we took the kids to Disney (CJ went with us). I sat CJ down and apologized for her childhood. I said I wish I had been in a better place when she was their age, I know I can never truly make up for it, etc. I said I know it'll take time for her to heal from that.\n\nI thought that was it, but since then, CJ has constantly complained whenever her siblings get anything. I'm always super sensitive to her feelings, validate them etc. But things came to a head recently, on Jack's birthday. Instead of a party, he opted to see the off-broadway production of Frozen. We as always, invited CJ to come along, as well as her fiance. The whole night, she was pouting and seemed upset. I tried talking to her but she brushed it off. We went to dinner after the show. Jack and Melissa were excitedly talking about it. CJ then butted in \"You know what I got for my 5th birthday, Jack? A Barbie from the dollar store.\"\n\nThe kids didn't really see the big deal, but the adults at the table understood. I was civil the rest of the meal but later called CJ and told her what she did was unacceptable. I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so. I said I was disappointed and hung up. Later, CJ sent me a very long text, telling me I was a horrible mother.

I can\u2019t think OF one one present I ever received from my parents (not to discredit them because they paid for literally everything in my life). But I always knew they did their best and I have always been grateful. CJ really needs to speak with a therapist and work on her insecurities. I don\u2019t get the hint from your post that you neglected her while giving her siblings more. NTA", " NTA from info given. She\u2019s almost 30 years old and acting like a petulant child. From what you said, you truly did your best to raise her in a healthy and happy home and make sure she felt loved and had fun things from time to time. \n\nIt sounds like she resents your \u201cnew family\u201d with husband and younger children but life goes on and you include her in all these vacations etc and you did the best you could as a young single mother and built a better financial life over time and with the help of a stable partner. \n\nIt sounds like CJ needs therapy to work through these issues. She doesn\u2019t seem to have any perspective or maturity. \n\nUnless there\u2019s more to the story\u2026", "NTA - as a child who grew up well below the poverty line, I could resent my mother. But instead, I salute her for grinding. By the time I was graduating college so was my mother and she lived a wonderful life after that point. Mama is gone now (RIP) but I NEVER ONCE MADE feel bad about struggling and affording my brother more than me.", "Not only are you NTA, but major kudos to you for your accomplishments.\n\nYou had a kid at 17, as a single mother. Yet, you still managed to not only graduate from high school, but college as well. You also kept a leveled head and prioritized what little money you did have. Would she have been happy to have more toys and less food? \n\nYou know what is more important than materialistic things? Love and attention, which you gave her. I\u2019m sorry that she doesn\u2019t see it like that, and I feel bad for you that she doesn\u2019t appreciate you trying to spoil her more as an adult. I can understand children being more materialistic, but she is 28. She knows the cost of living and the difficulty it must have been to do that single. If she never says it, I will: Good job, mom. You took a shitty hand and made a beautiful life with it. You did nothing wrong, 100% NTA.", "NTA.  I think your daughter needs to talk to a professional, honestly.  She has a lot of built up resentment, and thinks it's acceptable to lash out to make you feel bad for being more successful now than when she was little.\n\nAnd you have guilt, that probably makes you put up with a lot more than you should.   Best of luck to both of you.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is plenty old enough to understand you did the best you could under the circumstances you were handed. She was fed, clothed, cared for and educated. Above all, she was loved. By you. \n\nStop apologizing to her. It\u2019s sad that all she remembers of her childhood is going without material things growing up, not your sacrifices or the fun times you had, even on a shoe string budget. At 28 years old, one would think she would have more perspective- there are children out there who have far less than she ever had growing up, that being jealous over her younger siblings is ridiculous. At this point in your lives, she should be happy that she gets to share your success now that you\u2019re thriving and in a position to enjoy life more.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NAH.\n\nIn another comment, you say that CJ is in therapy, which is good for her. I think it would be worth it for you to do family therapy as well.\n\nCJ's feelings about her upbringing are clearly different than yours. She's having a hard time dealing with them. On one hand, she's \"old enough to know better\", but on the other hand, it's probably very difficult for her to have those feelings when she's constantly reminded that her siblings have more than she did, in so many ways. They have a father and a mother who are both loving, capable, giving parents. I don't think it's fair to call her an AH when she's dealing with unresolved trauma.\n\nETA: A lot of people are replying with \"she didn't experience trauma\" or \"she should be grateful because other people have it worse.\" First, we don't know CJ's story. We don't know what she went through. We have only OP's word for it, and it's very likely that her version of CJ's childhood is much better than CJ's version. Second, there will always be someone who has it worse. My father was physically abusive, but I've been told that I should be grateful that he didn't molest me. Really? No. Just because someone has it worse doesn't invalidate a person's lived experience.", "NAH\u2026 But, at that dinner when she said that\u2026 man, I would\u2019ve gone and given her a big hug and really acknowledged how much of a struggle it was just to get by. Yes, in front of everyone. Yes, even though she was inappropriate. \n\nShe grew up in that. If you didn\u2019t experience that poverty until later in your life, that\u2019s a totally different thing. And you\u2019re older. So, even though you\u2019re moving on with life- she may only be starting to grasp how those experiences shaped her. She\u2019s perhaps only beginning to understand what she missed out on and how different her life may have been with more opportunities. That\u2019s a challenge no matter what. But, watching that kind of life unfold for her siblings, is going to hit different. \n\nShe\u2019s going to need time to process and mature. I don\u2019t think you need to endlessly apologize so much as you need to make sure you stay connected to her experience and your unique relationship. \n\nDefinitely let her know that it\u2019s not okay for her to use your history as a weapon to hurt you, but that you\u2019re always okay with listening and working through it together. And just keep showing up! Therapy together might be really beneficial. It\u2019s a lot to unpack!", "NTA. As a 28 year old woman, I could not imagine A. Harping on my poor mom, who literally did everything she could to make sure I was sheltered, fed, etc. And B. Being jealous of a child to the point that I'm willing to try and ruin their birthday. \n\nI could understand her sitting you down, explaining that it hurts, allowing you both an opportunity to discuss it and for her to get some healing. But her attitude of \"I can bring it up whenever I want.\" is unacceptable. She can be petty and nasty all she wants, but that doesn't mean that people have to tolerate it. She is a fully grown adult and she needs to act like it before she alienates herself from everyone.", "NAH\n\nBut maybe don\u2019t include her on those flashy kid events, but rather celebrate with a meal at home, together.\n\nAnd therapy. Keep in mind that growing up in poverty constitutes an entire childhood of trauma.", "NAH and dont listen to advice from reddit concerning this, growing up poor myself, never having anything and also coming from a broken home.\n\nYou have to understand, if you dont already that it's not neccesarily about her not understanding it all, but depending on how you're treated by your peers just for being poor it can be rough.\n\nI think the hard part for your daugther right now is seeing you giving your children everything she ever longed for in her childhood and couldn't have, you were probably stretched out thin during that time as well.\n\nthe only thing that can fix this is long conversations about the past, which also includes you acknowledging the same complaint she always had, because that seems to be something that she has been carrying around for a long time, she seeing your children grow up and have a happy childhood must hurt her a lot because she is constantly comparing it to her childhood which causes a lot of trauma to resurface.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone participating in this thread, especially the people coming forward here and sharing their unfiltered childhood experience and in my oppinion rightfully so, your different views on certain aspects of what happened to you back then, helped me a lot to better understand the process of processing my childhood trauma over the past few years.\n\nIt helped me a lot, Thanks so much", "It\u2019s hard to not to resent your situation, if you were in CJ\u2019s position. Imagine comparing against your peers but you can\u2019t help but be born to your parents and hence socioeconomic background. At least there is some solace in that. \n\nBut now, you have these siblings who have all that you wanted - a nice, nuclear family with both parents who hold steady jobs and want for nothing. You understand your mother was put in a hard position but so were you\u2014 and this wasn\u2019t out of anything you could have controlled. Your mother made some hard choices but she had those choices. You were ultimately a child subjected to them. \n\nYes, her siblings would never need to know struggle and that\u2019s a good thing but also, it will always be a stark reminder of what she lacked. Because this is what she could have had, in an alternate reality where things were kinder to you, and therefore, kinder to her. \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s a very, very sympathetic ESH because growing up poor is traumatising. You learn to minimise your wants and needs because you know how hard it is for your parent(s) to earn money. You spend as little as possible to not be a burden and you also try to not cause too much trouble and take up your parent(s)\u2019 attention because their time could be better spent working/relaxing. And even when the situation gets better financially, it takes time and effort to unlearn that. \n\nShe\u2019s older now and she needs to reconcile the fact life is unfair but she\u2019s not able to and she\u2019s taking it out on the family. She\u2019s an AH for that. But also? I\u2019m not seeing any real work you\u2019ve tried to put in to help her. All you talk about is trying to make things \u201ceven\u201d (they can never be!) but nothing about *helping* her. She may be an adult but you will always be her parent and parenthood takes a lot more than just throwing money at your problems. \n\nAlso put yourself in her shoes for a bit. She goes to college and you meet your husband and start this do-over family without her. I\u2019m not saying you did by the way, I\u2019m just saying this might be what it looks like. That you have this perfect family while she was away. I\u2019m not saying your daughter feels this way, I\u2019m just sharing what I know a friend personally felt in a similar situation: that this only really reinforced her belief that she was dragging her mother down, because look! Her mother\u2019s life is suddenly picture perfect without her around! \n\n(they now basically have no relationship and my heart hurts because I know they love each other.) \n\nThere are problems here that I think you both need to work on together. And yes, some feelings are ugly but please, you need to allow room for them. I personally think telling her that she essentially needs to shut up about her childhood because that spoils the mood was in bad taste. Think about your word choice. That she \u201cthrew\u201d her lived experience \u201cin your face\u201d. Is she supposed to shut up entirely then? To appease you? Because you don\u2019t want to have to \u201ckeep apologising\u201d? Because from what you\u2019ve said\u2014 you aren\u2019t framing it that you\u2019re mad that she\u2019s taking it out on the family. You are mad that she reminded you that you failed her and are continuing to fail her. \n\nYou are much kinder to yourself than you are kind to her. And you both need all the kindness that you can get. It\u2019s clear you both love one another and keep trying to make your relationship work, so please. Keep working at it. I really hope the best for you both, as individuals and as mother and daughter.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou have to put yourself in your daughter\u2019s shoes growing up. While you did all you could, I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t know the extent of the struggles she had growing up, emotionally and psychologically, caused by financial instability. The helplessness she felt. On top of that, you were probably stressed all the time. And it would have impacted how you related to each other as mother and daughter. And now, she sees you with your new family all being happy celebrating and taking trips, especially since you invite her to them. Has she said no? Did you insist she come? \n\nThe huge differences in her and her siblings childhood are being rubbed in her face over and over again. I mean, her building resentment is understandable. \n\nShe needs therapy for this. She has all that baggage she had to work on. And you dismissing her feelings on it, didn\u2019t help. It probably even added to her idea of you started all over w/ a new family with a clean slate that she\u2019s no longer part of.\n\nWork with her or you\u2019ll lose her to resentment. And to the people saying she\u2019s 28, she should get over it by now. You don\u2019t know how financial instability shapes a child\u2019s mind. I\u2019ve had that growing up and it gave me general anxieties that I only put a name on when I\u2019m in my 30s. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It\u2019s understandable why she feels jealousy over the fact that her younger siblings are getting to grow up wealthier than she did, but it sounds like you\u2019ve been understanding and validating these feelings. It sounds like you did your best in a tough situation and have made a better life now for all three of your children. If she hasn\u2019t already, CJ should consider trying to work through these feelings of resentment in therapy before they get in the way of her relationship with her mother and younger siblings.", "NAH \n\n  Is she bullying your kids or calling them spoiled? Is she demanding you apologise? If not, I think it's ok both for her to bring up the disparaties sometimes and for you not to apologise. Do you talk about childhood moments with her with your other kids? Even positive ones? There's likely going to be significant social and cultural differences between her and your younger children for the rest of their lives. Make sure you're not giving her the impression that your life together is something you're trying to forget and move on from.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I see why she feels the way she does, as I\u2019m sure you do. I\u2019ve been in her shoes and my god does it suck. But there comes a point when you just have to accept that your childhood is what it is and you move on from it. CJ isn\u2019t that much younger than me, and I definitely had made peace with my feelings towards my parents and younger siblings and their comparatively better upbringing by the time I was 28. I don\u2019t know what she expects from you, and it doesn\u2019t seem like she does either. All I can say with certainty is that it seems like you did the best you could at all times and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad for the fact that the best you can do now is better than the best you could do when she was younger.", "Probably an unpopular take but soft YTA. You say CJ is always invited to things with your husband and younger kids. What do you do that\u2019s just for you and CJ? She probably feels like an afterthought because those are things she missed out on as a kid that she\u2019s now \u201ctagging along with\u201d now. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to give better experiences to your youngests, you should be able to do something special for her. If you can do all that for a birthday for your younger kid, you can do a special something for CJ for her birthday that maybe doesn\u2019t turn into a whole family trip, so that she feels special and gets a unique experience with you.\n\nAlso you can start making it up to her to even it out. You said she has a fianc\u00e9? Contribute to her wedding or honeymoon so she gets a better experience than she might have expected. There are things you can do and saying that you can\u2019t ever even it out is a complete cop out. Your 5 and 6 year old don\u2019t need a special vacation every year. You can find ways to help balance this out but it seems like at this point, you\u2019ve written off your adult daughter for your new family.", "I think NAH.\n\nI just think you have an eldest child whose dealing with childhood trauma, which could be from growing up poor, to you possibly being spread to thin as a parent to offer the support her siblings are able to get during important moments she maybe hasn't had the ability to express yet, to the lack of having her father in her life, etc. I can't say without knowing her side. \nI know as a kid who grew up poor, knew the fears of no food or housing, and had a mom who worked all the time that it impacted me, and It comes up in weird ways. I once got mad when my partner drove me by his family home because it was nice and beautiful and I never got that. I once saw my 35 year old sister break down crying cause my younger brother and I got to go on a trip, and it wasn't because she couldn't go then but because she never got that from our dad as a child.\n\nAlso, though of course it's not your fault, she may realize that your other children will always have a better running start in life than she had and that's a painful pill to swallow, especially when you see it unfolding in front of you.\n\nEven though she's an adult, we all have an inner child that needs soothing and healing and she's obviously still working on that. Again, I don't know all sides but family therapy, doing more to incorporate her into your new family, and even letting her vent more about this could help even if it feels like a hard thing to do. I also think it's important that your younger children know that their older sister may struggle to see them get so many nice things because she didn't, and it can teach them to learn about how the world works and why kindness and humility are so important, plus it's a part of being a family. Other than that, I hope you two find a healthy conclusion so that you're whole family can come together and find happiness with each other.", "NTA. I had a very similar upbringing, except both my dad and my mom went on to either have more kids they could spoil, or became very stable/wealthy after I was an independent adult.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I did resent my mom (my primary caretaker) for constantly moving us around and failing to provide a comfortable life for us. I also resented my dad for moving out of state and basically starting a new family. \n\nBut as I got older and realized how hard/unfair life is, I came to the conclusion that they were both just doing their best. I also realize how absolutely selfish it is to think that my father wasn\u2019t allowed to have a life without me. \n\nIt is 0% their fault for finally climbing themselves out of poverty after it could benefit me, or for continuing their lives after me\n\nNow, Im glad they\u2019re able to spoil their current kids, and I\u2019m glad  they can feel a little better about themselves by giving my siblings a better future. I\u2019m also happy they are just struggling less in general; no one should have to fight tooth and nail to live a relatively stable life. \n\nSpending any kind of time being jealous that they\u2019re better off now is just a toxic drain on my own life. \n\nI hope your daughter is able to make the same conclusion soon. You seem like you genuinely care about your daughter, and it would be a shame for her to miss out on the love you very clearly have for her \n\nI think just give it some time. She may still have a little growing to do", "NTA....BUT \nHer feelings are valid. I grew up with young/ incredibly emotionally underdeveloped parents.\nMy dad also basically got to start living life when I was 17 as I was out of the house and his job was better. \nWatching my little brothers get the dad I never had, schooling, luxuries, etc. is very bittersweet. It definitely feels like they are his 'real' family most days. \n\nHowever, it is completely inappropriate for her to lash out in front of her siblings. I have never once spoken to my siblings about my upbringing. They haven't got a single clue things are different. They would feel guilt and I don't ever want to cause them hurt. She needs to think about their feelings instead of her unresolved emotions.\n\nShe needs therapy, and if you would be willing to attend with her it would probably help a lot more. Her feelings likely go deeper than vacations and material objects. She might also hold resentment for things she was exposed to or how you handled certain parenting situations as a young/single mom. Ultimately it is up to her to accept it and move forward. She has it better than a lot, as it seems you do go out of your way to include her in the more comfortable lifestyle you have worked hard for. \n\nIn my family if you make things uncomfortable you don't participate. Maybe discuss (during therapy) that her behavior is effecting the family as a whole and if she can't control her emotions she doesn't need to participate.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, OP. You seem to be trying your best, and there's no handbook for life.", "NTA. You did a great job managing to keep a roof over CJ's head and food in her mouth while she was growing up. You need to stop feeling bad about her upbringing and stop telling her how sorry you are for that. You have nothing to feel sorry about. \n\nThe next time she brings this up suggest she talks to a therapist to work through her childhood issues. Remind her that you are not a therapist and she needs to figure out how to be at peace with her childhood and grow up. Say it every single time she starts talking crap.", "NTA. At 28 years old, your daughter needs to grow TF up. Time for a serious sit-down with her about the realities of your life, what you did to keep her fed, housed and clothed. Tell her you understand that if she were a child her jealousy would be understandable, but as an adult herself, she needs to accept that you did what you could and that now you are in a position to provide more for everyone, including her. I would honestly tell her that if she cannot get over this and be supportive and accepting, you can\u2019t invite her when she is so negative. You both should be celebrating your success!", "NTA. CJ is jealous, and it's not a good look. You did your best. I for one am very proud of you xxxx", "NTA. Her feelings are understandable, because it was not her fault her upbringing sucked but it was not yours either. She needs to understand how you broke your back trying to give her the best life you could, its not like you denied her luxuries on purpose. To guilt trip you and try and make your younger kids feel bad about it is very immature.  \n\nShe is clearly still hurt from the struggles of the past. Your daughter needs therapy to help her move on from her difficult childhood so she can enjoy her current life.", "No you're NTA\n\nAs you've pointed out, its unfortunate that that CJ and yourself lived near poverty - but it sounds like you did everything possible to be a good mother.  I think the way you've approached it since you've become financially better off and re-married etc has been good.\n\nCJ doesn't have to get over it but she should try to be understanding and shouldn't be throwing it in your face every chance she gets.  CJ is definitely old enough now to know how the world works and that you did the best you can.  Is she in therapy? If not maybe she should be.", "NTA, you did the best you could in the circumstances and technically CJ got a Barbie and got to see Frozen with her fiance.", "NTA.  You did the best you could with the money you had.  It's not like you had lots of extra money and spent it all on yourself while making your daughter go without.  What exactly does she expect, that you can rewrite the past and not be poor during her childhood?  I'm sorry, but she seems immature and bitter, and I think family therapy is needed to get past this.\n\nI come from a background with lots of material goods and privileges, but a very mentally ill and abusive mother (divorced).   I would gladly have traded a loving, supportive, emotionally stable mother who was poor for my life of wealth, abuse and neglect.  Your daughter did NOT get the short end of the stick.  You do NOT need to keep apologizing.", "NTA.  Let CJ know you love her but she needs to get some therapy for her feelings because you cannot change history and she cannot keep seething on the past.  Let her know if she doesn't then you will have to limit contact because you want to move forward with her in a good way, but you will move forward without her if she doesn't work with you for a better relationship.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  You should not have apologized for CJ's childhood.  You had a very challenging situation, yet you were successful in the end.  That's an incredible accomplishment and you should be proud of it.  Even though it was hard, CJ should be proud of it too.\n\nSo what to do now?  CJ's grudge isn't healthy for her.  Really she should get counseling to help understand her anger.  But I don't know how successful you're going to be if you suggest that.  Perhaps the best approach is to tell her that you love her, you did the best you could with what you had, and while it was hard, it is not acceptable for her to keep attacking you in this way (because she is attacking you).  It may take some time, but ultimately she'll realize she's not doing anyone a favor with her behavior.  Good luck.", "NTA. You seem to be doing the best you can for all of your children. Your best might have looked different and involved limited resources during CJ\u2019s childhood, but it was your best. \n\nIt might be something worth being to family counseling, though. There seems to be a lot of underlying hurt. Poverty can be a complex trauma in itself and it may be something CJ needs to keep processing as an adult. Or maybe this is something else that CJ is projecting onto the material items. None of this is your fault - like I said, you did the best you could and I can tell you love your daughter. Maybe doing your best for each other now involves some professional intervention and organized processing.", "NTA. I'm 28 years old, and the oldest of two siblings. I was afforded absolutely nothing growing up, barring one school year that I was permitted to go to the after school program hosted by my middle school. My younger brother (now 19) got everything. Time with our dad (his father, my stepfather) at the gun range, going out to play DnD with the adults, privileges and extracurriculars I could never dream of. I wasn't a bad kid, just not the favorite. My mother and I have had a lot of discussions about it in the past year, and I'm finally at peace- as much as I can be. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter may be holding onto a lot of bitterness. I recognize the financial burden you had- and entirely understand why lived the way you did. Money doesn't grow on trees. However it's possible that she doesn't fully understand why there's a difference between how the kids are being raised vs how she was. You may want to try and talk with her about it, see if you can find the root of it and go from there.  However, her telling your son what she did was unkind and unacceptable.", "NTA. I had a very similar upbringing, except both my dad and my mom went on to either have more kids they could spoil, or became very stable/wealthy after I was an independent adult.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I did resent my mom (my primary caretaker) for constantly moving us around and failing to provide a comfortable life for us. I also resented my dad for moving out of state and basically starting a new family. \n\nBut as I got older and realized how hard/unfair life is, I came to the conclusion that they were both just doing their best. I also realize how absolutely selfish it is to think that my father wasn\u2019t allowed to have a life without me. \n\nIt is 0% their fault for finally climbing themselves out of poverty after it could benefit me, or for continuing their lives after me\n\nNow, Im glad they\u2019re able to spoil their current kids, and I\u2019m glad  they can feel a little better about themselves by giving my siblings a better future. I\u2019m also happy they are just struggling less in general; no one should have to fight tooth and nail to live a relatively stable life. \n\nSpending any kind of time being jealous that they\u2019re better off now is just a toxic drain on my own life. \n\nI hope your daughter is able to make the same conclusion soon. You seem like you genuinely care about your daughter, and it would be a shame for her to miss out on the love you very clearly have for her \n\nI think just give it some time. She may still have a little growing to do\n\nEdit: and to your point about constantly apologizing, no. It isnt fair of her to expect you to be frozen in time, perpetually feeling awful that her life was a little hard. You acknowledged that you didnt give her the life she deserved, but you also were doing your best. She knows this. Continuing to say sorry isn\u2019t going to reverse time and undo it", "NTA. You did your best as a young, struggling single parent. You pushed through and slowly but surely improved your life. I'm proud of you for that, and your daughter needs to come to terms with this all as well. You. Did. Your. Best.  And you still are under new circumstances! I commend you for always including her, but stop apologizing for something you worked hard on. Be proud of where you are, and it's time to let any guilt go.", "ESH I get both sides. Your daughter definitely has jealous feelings which is valid. You were a single mom and did what you could. Just keep talking healthy about it. Maybe she wants to vent to you about what that experience was like and you could explain as well being a single mom but as adults now.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI grew up really poor. As in, we didn\u2019t even have a bathroom and shower in my home poor. Slowly my parents started gaining wealth and thank god by the time I was a teen they were actually quite wealthy. \nMy brothers got a lot more as kids than me (I\u2019m the oldest by quite a lot). I would never blame my parents or throw shade that they managed to grow out of extreme poverty and make a good living. \n\nYour daughter sounds like a complete ungrateful asshole. You did everything you could to make her childhood as good as you could. I am sure that includes a lot of sacrifices on your end. It isn\u2019t on you at all.", "NTA.  Your daughter's feelings are very understandable but at her age she 100 percent should know that siblings with age gaps don't always get the same material conditions growing up.

Sounds like she has some therapy or internal work to do to come to terms with her upbringing (which doesn\u2019t sound all that awful to be honest). You\u2019re approaching it just as you should: being empathetic and understanding, but realizing that you can\u2019t change the past. She needs to accept and move on, especially at 28, if only for herself.", "This is a tough one.. you're looking at things the right way but I don't think you're executing it as you had hoped. It sounds like you're just inviting your daughter along when you're already doing these activities with your new family which she has never truly been a part of (living together). I think to show your daughter you really care about her you need to do something with her, just for her. Not with your other kids. Maybe go on a vacation where you only bring her.

You're doing what parents are supposed to do - the best you can with what you've got. You just happen to have more now than you did then,  as is true for most people. It's it fair? No, but life rarely is.\n\nYour daughter is nearly 30 years old and I can't quite justify her being upset that you were broke then but aren't now. If you'd abused her or neglected her,  then I could understand but all of her complaints are materialistic and childish. \n\nI would encourage you to try and talk through this on a deeper level though. At 17 it's difficult to be an engaged parent. It's even harder when you're single,  and more so when you're working AND trying to get an education to improve your circumstances. It's possible this isn't really about material things so much as how different you are as a parent and it's just easier to put a name to the obvious material items.", "NTA. I was the CJ growing up: the older sibling who didn\u2019t get much, compared to my younger sibling who does.

There are ways to express being hurt and upset that don\u2019t seek to hurt others.", "Absolutely NTA.  CJ needs to mature and learn how to move forward.  Especially if she is getting married-she should be old enough to see how this is not ok.  Therapy might help.  She can\u2019t take it out on you or her siblings.  You did the best you could, be proud of what you did provide and how far you have come.  Stipulations would be made if it were me.  Only invites if she agrees to be mature.  Not fair to you or her siblings to being that energy in.  And honestly it is very toxic and unhealthy for her.", "NTA.  You did the best that you could with what you had at the time.  Your daughter had food, a home, a mother who loves and cares for her. Sounds like a decent upbrining to me even without the materialistic things and holidays.  A lot of children don't get any of that, the love and care, the home, the food. Sounds like your daughter needs to get some help because she doesn't realise how lucky she is.  No you don't have to keep apologising.   My parents did foster care, and one of my foster brothers by the time he was 3 when he came to live with us had cigatette burns all over his body from his drug addict prostitute Mum and her clients, and he had already been sexually abused, she was letting her clients abuse him.", "NTA\nYou did your best with what you had. You can't always choose your circumstances, but what you do within them and how you respond to them.\n\nI am sorry to say this, but your daughter seems to have a superficial worldview. That the true value of things is measured by their cost. The worst thing is that you can't explain it to her - it will look as if you are trying to defend yourself. Hopefully she will understand as she matures.\n\nIn our society there is so much focus on money and what they can buy. But children really wants their parents presence over their presents - probably both if they can.

Her father did not stick around and we really struggled for a bit. Even when I graduated college, I had a bunch of student loan debt as well as juggling rent, food and other expenses. CJ never lacked necessities, but I admit she didn't get a lot of material possesions. I would try to save up as much as possible to make Christmas and birthdays as fun as possible, but she didn't get much else throughout the year and we only went on 2 vacations. We definitely ate a lot of struggle meals and had to move often. We honestly teetered on the poverty line.\n\nWhen CJ was 17, I was finally debt free, got a promotion at work and was doing much better. I did start to give her things throughout the year. I used my bonus to take her to Disney World-somewhere she always wanted to go but couldn't. It was nice that after years of struggling, I could spoil her a little.\n\nShe went off to college and in this time, I met my husband \"Matthew\". We got married and now have 2 kids together, \"Jack\" (5M) and \"Melissa\" (6F). With our combined incomes, we live quite comfortably. I admit, Jack and Melissa have gotten a lot more than CJ did at that age. I've certainly never left her out. She's always invited on our trips (we pay), I get her random gifts throughout the year, birthdays and Christmases are bigger. I'm trying to make it as even as I can, but I know it realistically never will be. \n\nCJ first pointed out the discrepancy a couple of years ago we took the kids to Disney (CJ went with us). I sat CJ down and apologized for her childhood. I said I wish I had been in a better place when she was their age, I know I can never truly make up for it, etc. I said I know it'll take time for her to heal from that. \n\nI thought that was it, but since then, CJ has constantly complained whenever her siblings get anything. I'm always super sensitive to her feelings, validate them etc. But things came to a head recently, on Jack's birthday. Instead of a party, he opted to see the off-broadway production of Frozen. We as always, invited CJ to come along, as well as her fiance. The whole night, she was pouting and seemed upset. I tried talking to her but she brushed it off. We went to dinner after the show. Jack and Melissa were excitedly talking about it. CJ then butted in \"You know what I got for my 5th birthday, Jack? A Barbie from the dollar store.\"\n\nThe kids didn't really see the big deal, but the adults at the table understood. I was civil the rest of the meal but later called CJ and told her what she did was unacceptable. I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so. I said I was disappointed and hung up. Later, CJ sent me a very long text, telling me I was a horrible mother. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA \n\nMy mother was a single mom to two kids when she was 17, we lived in the car at one point, I had adult responsibilities when I was 8. I couldn't participate in after school activities because I had to take care of my brother. When we were older and I was able to play a sport my mother never came to games because she was working all the time.\n\nI lived in 21 different states before I was 16, and that's not including all the times we moved locally. As an adult, I have trouble forming attachments and if I don't move once a year I get incredibly anxious.\n\nMy mom and stepdad adopted four kids (siblings) when me, my brother, and stepsister were grown and were, for the most part, able to provide better for them than they did for us and while I might have rolled my eyes when they got away with things I would have been yelled at for, I never resented them or my parents because our experiences were different. \n\nYour daughter definitely has issues but she sounds like one of those ppl who thinks because she suffered everyone else should have to suffer as well, to be \"fair\".\n\n I'd stop apologizing and tell her life isn't fair, you did the best you could and she needs to work on her issues in therapy and leave your kids out of it. I'd also stop inviting her to things. She's not appreciative, and it sounds like she just goes so she can complain and bring everyone down.", "NTA and suggest therapy. Infact I\u2019d suggest some therapy for you to just help give you some ideas on how best to deal with CJ\u2019s resentment.", "NTA.\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I have no personal way of understanding what CJ went through. Money was never an issue for my family growing up (at least as far as I know), and I can't think of any significant difference in how my parents treated me v. how they treated my younger siblings. \n\nI initially thought about voting NAH. However:\n\n1) OP mentions that she was able to start taking steps to improve her and CJ's overall quality of life when CJ was 17, and CJ is 28 at the time of this post. I know that overcoming trauma isn't really something that you can put a deadline on, but after 11 years, shouldn't CJ at least be able to understand that her mother did the best she could given the circumstances?\n\n2) \"I cannot continuously apologize for her upbringing and she can't throw it in my face. I asked if she wanted me to give her siblings less, simply because she did. She said no, but that she can bring it up whenever she wants and she'll continue to do so.\"\n\nHow much more is OP supposed to do to atone? As others have pointed out, there is certainly more that OP can and should do to help CJ overcome her trauma, and it looks like OP is definitely willing to put in the effort to do that. But at the risk of sounding insensitive, is CJ going to be bitter about her trauma and OP's shortcomings for the rest of both their lives?\n\n3) CJ's barb toward Jack at the birthday dinner and her complete lack of remorse when OP called her out (plus the fact that she doubled down further afterward) was what pushed my vote past NAH and into NTA. As I said in my first point, it's not right to place a deadline on when CJ should be over her trauma. But using said trauma as an excuse to hurt other people is what makes her TA.", "I don\u2019t think she should take out her resentment on her siblings but it\u2019s like a slap in the face to cj. Yes she\u2019s grown but people take all kinds of things from their childhood. Their good or bad experiences will mold them for better or worse. Obviously growing up while struggling isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world but it can have some lasting effects. For me I grew up struggling so I\u2019m not going to have kids until I\u2019m financially secure so my child won\u2019t have to struggle the same way I did. I feel since none of us ask to be here, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to make sure all our needs and wants are met because again we are born out of our parents selfish desire to have unprotected sex and procreate. So maybe for cj she feels it\u2019s not fair to have her while you struggled. She probably feels it wasn\u2019t fair that you didn\u2019t wait until you were secure like with the other kids. Seeing you do things for them she wished you could of did for her just reminds her of how much she wanted but couldn\u2019t have. To see  a 6 year old who, can\u2019t even appreciate the value of the things he getting while she had to settle for dollar store Barbie at his age is wild to her. And that\u2019s valid. However her anger is misplaced. She shouldn\u2019t be mad at her siblings. Just her parents if she wants to be mad at anything cause they put her in the situation she grew up in. You aren\u2019t an A but she just needs to get all her anger and resentment out on you one day and just let it go after that.

You were a team and each other\u2019s #1. Totally understandable that that changes and that she is no longer your priority, but USUALLY you don\u2019t see a new set of siblings getting the attention and the material items. \n\nA lot of what you now do for/with her sounds like random gifts and family trips. Which are MUCH appreciated. But I wonder if you have 1:1 time now?  She\u2019s seeing you at an expensive birthday she never got, which stings, but more than that, I think the one thing she valued above material items was your bond and that\u2019s not as strong anymore. I think she\u2019s jealous, but the monetary items are easier to grab onto. \n\nHonestly, you both sort of grew up together. You were kids at the same time for a while. I think you have a cool opportunity to be adults together now. I wish my mom and I could have transitioned to adult friends instead of just a mom and daughter who loved each other. I wish I could have gotten her tipsy more and talked to her about shit like a peer and been unguarded in  the way you are with your bff. I really think what she wants is the closeness and the intimacy you shared when you were a family of 2. Invite her to brunch or a girls weekend or have a regular nail appointment. Something with just you two showing love the way you used to, quality time and closeness.", "she had a rough childhood and seeing these kids not have to grow up poor is just making her feel like shit all the time, on top of the fact that they are your priority now. i get it. maybe try to do some special things just for her", "You sound like u are really trying ur best. It does seem like she is resentful of ur new family. Possibly (if u don't already) don't just include her in ur new family activities. Do some activities with just her as well.

It sounds like CJ had a loving parent and access to all the basics. That alone is more than a vast number of people get. \n\nHer anger is not only damaging her relationships (including with her sibs) but is damaging *her.* OP is right to pull her up short finally, but I second the idea that some counseling (solo certainly, maybe also joint) would be helpful.", "Talk with her and explain you\u2019ll do nice things for the kids, but they might be triggering for her and give her the option. \n\nOr maybe have a few do-over birthdays for her.", "Interesting you call your middle child your eldest, it makes it feel like even you consider her 'outside' your 'actual' family. She probably can feel that (and on top of the disparity in childhood experiences) it is causing her to lash out. Are there ways she can be more included in family events and activities with the children, or one on one with you and your husband so she feels more part of the family? Remember it was once only you and her against the world - and now you have a husband and two small ones and she feels understandably replaced and jealous of the difference in childhood experiences.\n\nDefinitely needs therapy", "Fair enough. I do say things like this to my kids sometimes (similar ages to your younger ones) and I'm not resentful at all. I just don't want them growing up entitled. I'm also glad not to be a materialistic or status-seeking person myself and I'd like that for them too as adults.

When she sat her down about her childhood being different compared to her other kids. I get she shouldn't be bending over backwards but she waited a long time into adulthood to talk one on one about it. Yes adult daughter should be able to talk about it in a healthier way.

If you still love your daughter, still try to be in her life, and still treat her with kindness and respect, you are doing everything right. She just needs to grow up", "Don't listen to this asshole. You did the best you possibly could with what little you had. Your daughter is obviously very envious of her siblings, but that doesn't give her the right to treat you like crap just because you're finally not living on the edge of poverty anymore. You already apologized and have continued to include her on your success ladder by sharing when you've had something TO share. You can't tell me that she never saw your struggle and sacrifice to make sure that she was taken care of as she grew up, but she wants to act like you didn't do enough?....over things.  It sucks that she grew up in a poor household, but life's not fair, and she's not entitled to things that you literally couldn't afford to give. What exactly is she expecting to happen? That every time you give somebody a gift, she gets a gift too? Does she want you to hold a party wherein you give her a gift for every birthday and Christmas that she didn't get what she wanted? We don't get reparations for a crappy childhood. She needs to stop acting like a toddler and accept the cards that she was dealt, but that's easier said than done. I really think she needs to discuss this with a therapist because she's starting to take her anger out on you, and to a lesser extent, her siblings. She's the only one who can manage her emotions about the situation.", "I agree with you and I'm not suggesting the level of resentment that seems present from CJ is healthy in any way. There seems to be a lot of resentment that should have been dealt with years ago. \n\nI would imagine you know kids often lash out at the \"safe\" parent, but that usually happens at a younger age; I'm just suggesting that perhaps rather than her directing that at her father when she was younger, it's coming out and getting dumped on mom now. For anyone who deals with childhood trauma, it can come in waves. If she didn't have access to counselling as a child or as a teen, it's not shocking that she's still holding on to some of this. None of that makes her dumping on her mom ok and mom is absolutely NTA. \n\nWhile the anger and resentment is not appropriate and is misplaced, I would personally say it's valid, though the way she's handling it is not. It's unresolved trauma and it's certainly her responsibility as an adult to try and access the tools to help resolve and come to terms with it so she can be her best self. It's not at all appropriate or healthy based on what's here for her to be *blaming* her parents or expecting continued apologies from a mother who did all she could to provide for her daughter.", "She's gotten quite a few do-over birthdays in the 11 years since I started doing better financially.\n\nAnd she always has the option to come or not.

That is SO much more than what the vast majority of people can say. Sure growing up with not that much stuff can make some people feel less than. But let's be real. Being materialistic isn't a good quality, and OP gave her daughter a great hand to thrive in life. It's people like you that make her feel that she got less than she deserves, and that's what sucks.", "Have you ever had an abortion?", "It's not me.

OP has to deal with the consequences of her choices.", "CJ didn't seem to have an issue with it until she saw what her half siblings are getting now which is pretty typical of siblings until a certain age. It's a lesson to learn that things can never be truly equal. Your definition of a good spot to be a parent is just much higher than what most people would consider, and it reeks of classism. You are effectively saying that if you can only provide a dollar store doll for your kids' birthday and have to provide struggle meals at times, you shouldn't have a kid. Fortunately the government doesn't think like you, because a lot of people like me would have been deprived of a happy although frugal childhood, and loving parents that made us thriving individuals.", "So your options are to have an abortion, carry a baby to term and then put them up for adoption (very likely guaranteeing them a crappy life anyway), or having a kid at a not ideal time, and you think picking any one of them is a good or better decision? \n\nAnd she isn\u2019t shrugging anything off, she very clearly is making an effort to help her kid feel loved, included, and supported. She isn\u2019t just saying sorry, she is apologizing with words AND actions. What else would you like her to do, slit her wrists open and die apologizing with her last breath?\n\nThere\u2019s a point in life where you either forgive someone or you don\u2019t.

Her mother was capable of making better reproductive choices all along, but she chose not to for her life.", "The options are really to make better decisions in the first place.\nOnce that ship has sailed, yea you're gonna have a hard decision to make. Because you made bad decisions to get there. You either have an abortion, pick new parents to give the baby to, or parent.

In concrete terms, CJ will have to either accept the fact that OP's choice was indeed either not to have her, or to wish her good luck with foster/adoptive parents in the horrendous system we all know, or to raise her without luxury. Because let's be real, CJ is pouting about birthday gifts, she's not pouting about real life consequences that she could have been suffering from, such as developmental problems linked to malnutrition or what not, had she truly grown up in dire poverty. You are judging OP for poor reproductive decision making as if she had raised CJ in a situation of child abuse, which she absolutely did not.

This isn\u2019t to excuse the behavior on the daughter\u2019s part. It is to say she may be having some difficulties with life. (I was in an addiction in my 20s\u2014also not an excuse for bad behavior, but it didn\u2019t help me to learn and grow, that addiction) and I often blamed my lack of life skills on bad parenting (which was absolutely NOT true, but in my selfishness, I could not see it was me who was the problem). \n\nI am NOT saying OPs daughter has an addiction. Let me just get that out there. I\u2019m only saying it\u2019s not uncommon for life to be very difficult, disappointing, and much more emotionally exhausting than we are prepared for, as humans, regardless of parenting. It doesn\u2019t necessarily take addiction. Could be 23. Could be frustration that the economy is preventing success, could be a lot of things. And when one is in their early 20s, that is when they\u2019re figuring all this out. Blaming things on one\u2019s parents is fairly common, IMO, for those in their early 20s. Think back. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely correct and important for OP to set boundaries, and to even limit contact if these comments continue! Detachment doesn\u2019t mean lack of love. It was very helpful for me to know that my parents would be there for me always, no matter how bad I was, or how mad they were at me. And I always did\u2014it was my mom who gave me a resource, and told me she loved me (for the gadzillionth time) when I finally asked for help. \n\nI think in time the daughter might begin to see things as they actually are in regard to OP.

And let me say this, if it helps: lack of money isn\u2019t a thing I remember as a negative now (although in my 20s I had some resentment about it). We were poor, as in food stamps and thrift shops, but what I remember now is how much I got to do, in spite of the money, and how much I was loved\u2014and what a pain-in-the-ass I was. \n\nMoney is definitely not a measure of love, but she may be perceiving it so at this moment in her life, as the differences she\u2019s witnessing may be making her wonder if her life would be different \u201cif\u201d.

I really hate your attitude as if children can just spend their childhoods working through the trauma while they are experiencing it. First people usually work to get out of the situation and then have to process what that situation was. No one magically turns 18 and everything that has happened before just dissipates into thin air. And tbh is very unhealthy to try to force yourself to do so. Whatever unresolved trauma you have will be passed on to others if you dont have the space and time to address it.

Do you spend any 1:1 time with CJ after you've married Mathew and started a new family?  Do you cut CJ's time with you to run off after Jack or Melissa or Mathew?  \n\nWhy not take a simple vacation trip for a week with just yourself and CJ.  Maybe a road trip?  Absolutely no interruption from your new family.  Because if they do disturb  CJs time with you, you'd lose your daughter.  It will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  She'll go LC or NC.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

It is one thing if you HAD the money and chose to not do things for her but  a whole different one that you had NO money to spend. You did the best you could. I suggest asking her if she would prefer if you had given her up to the system for the risky chance that she would have been better off or the fact that you love her enough to keep her struggle through the challenges doing your VERY best and now that you have come out on top you SPEND equally on her.  Having nothing does not make you a bad mom and the fact that you were a single parent with 1 income stream but now it is a 2 parent stream is not an option you had back then. I think you should tell her she needs to get into therapy to get through her hang ups and maybe it should be family therapy for the 2 of you. I think that may help with her issues.

But you're older, with a husband, and a lot more stable. Maybe CJ needs to realize that everything you do isn't a personal attack directed at her.", "Okay so, this is pretty familiar for me. My mom had me when she was in her early 20s, and raised me on her own my whole life. We also struggled with money. She was a teacher and also studying, and we had to move around a lot because of landlords constantly raising rent prices. When I was growing up, I was aware that the majority of my friends had a lot more than we did in that way kids are kind of aware of wealth differences (they went on numerous holidays, got lots of toys, and lived in one house their whole lives). That being said, my mom made sure I was never lacking for necessities, and I always felt like birthdays and Christmases were special, no matter how 'poor' they might've seemed to others. \n\nShe met her partner several years ago, and they have to kids under ten. Because of his job, they're a lot more well off than we were, live in a house they own, and the kids get a lot more things than I did. \n\nGiven all this context, it's pretty safe to say I have an idea of how your daughter might feel. So with all that said, NTA. And honestly, your daughter kind of is. Not only did you do your best for her, but you've been trying to 'make up' for her missing out throughout her adulthood. I'm 25f, and I'd be thrilled if I got to go on trips like that. She's old enough to know that you don't have to be doing that, and that people's circumstances change as life goes on. You're better off now, and you're treating her because you want to. \n\nI get that seeing her young siblings getting expensive presents might be a bit weird for her. I've been there. Sometimes it's bizarre seeing my sisters with an ipad, because that's something that was so out of the realm of possibility when I was growing up. But even if it makes me feel a bit 'odd', I don't get upset or mad because there's no reason to. As someone who grew up poor as a child, Im just happy they get those things now. \n\nAnd while I get why your daughter might feel differently, the way she's behaving towards you and your other kids is where she crosses over into asshole territory. She might be entitled to her feelings, but constantly getting mad at you or calling you a bad mother over something in the past that you couldn't control, that you've tried to make up for, isn't okay. And taking that our on her 5yrold step sibling at their birthday party is so out of line. That's putting her feelings onto a child in an attempt to what? Make you feel guilty? Because you have nothing to feel guilty for. \n\nSo to sum up, from the POV of someone who's been in your daughters shoes, NTA. And I hope that you hear that you did a good job with her more than you hear her complaining, because based on what you've said, you really did. Well done. You deserve to enjoy the security and benefits that being well off provides, and I hope you're daughters able to understand that one day.", "NTA I can see where CJ is coming from but you did the best you could being a single mother!

Personally I would stop trying to include her, she's a drag, she's doing it deliberately to be hurtful, and she's quite clearly got some way to go before she learns humility and respect.

It doesn't sound like there's really much more for OP to do. I'm not saying the daughter isn't entitled to have negative feelings. But I think part of being an adult is exercising self control - there are appropriate outlets for the daughter's valid resentments (therapy, friends, partners) and inappropriate outlets (her apparently hard-working mother that did frankly much better than many with the cards she was dealt, the young step-siblings).

As much as I loved cheering for my brother at those (he's REALLY good, will get his black belt next year) it was annoying not to be able to at least spend a few hours on the beach, visit the aquarium or go on a trail once he was done competing... Nowadays they DO realize it's shitty to do that, though \n\nBut I'm absolutely happy that he gets to enjoy more stuff than I did, that he lives in a safer house and I buy him toys and games he wants every now and then (I also have a savings account for him to leave some money I'll give him when he's a bit older)\n\nI can understand your daughter feeling bitter cause she couldn't get the same, but she's an adult who's still getting amazing stuff from her mom and who should be happy her siblings aren't struggling like she did... \n\nI often tell my mom that the perks of being a working adult with my own (rented) house is that I can buy all the stuff I couldn't have growing up! I have so many fancy dinosaur toys, always makes me happy to get one!! And games, all the games I want", "NTA and for the record you\u2019re a great mom \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA CJ needs therapy to process her feelings about all of this. She's not wrong for feeling hurt or resentful but she is wrong for taking it out on you like this. You did the best you could in a tough situation and have done everything you can to make up for it since your circumstances have improved. Plus you gave her a sincere apology, now she needs to work through all this on her side.", "NTA.

I grew up with parents that spent a lot more money on my younger brother, certain memories I have, I wanted a computer so I got a second hand one, my brother wanted a computer and he got a brand new one. When I asked for a swag mega drive one Christmas again I got a second hand one, my brother asked for a Nintendo and got a brand new one! My mum is also very manipulative and would often try to play us both off against each other, as punishment she would also wreck our toys, clothes etc if we were naughty or didn\u2019t what she wanted us too, my brother was very clever though and basically managed to suck up to her and get what he wanted. Even now I have a rocky relationship with my mum. \nYou are a good mum and you are absolutely trying your best. Unfortunately she might not realise how much you struggled until she has children of her own.", "NTA. How were you supposed to give her more when there simply wasn't any/ enough? If she has a problem with her upbringing, therapy is the adult solution.", "NTA. My oldest brother always complained like this growing up because my parents were broke when he was little. My dad's response was always \"we always provided the maximum we could at the time. why do you want us to punish your siblings?\". He got over it.", "Soooo she basically told you she doesn\u2019t want her siblings to not have nice things but she\u2019s going to make you feel like shit every time you give them something because she\u2019s pissed you couldn\u2019t afford it for her growing up. Honestly I would limit your interactions with her until she has come to terms with her resentment somehow. You are trying to give her the best now that you can afford it, and instead of just accepting that life was hard back then and being grateful she is trying to make you miserable because she\u2019s jealous. NTA", "Yeah NTA, CJ clearly has  her reasons to be upset and she can voice them with you, she can work them through in individual or family therapy! But she has no right to involve her siblings in her bitterness. They did literally nothing to deserve having every one their special occasions constantly hijacked by their sisters trauma! 5 and 6 is definitly old enough to feel the resentment in her statement but not old enough to understand it's not about them - no trauma can be big enough to justify traumatising children over it.", "NTA. At 28yrs old she needs to take responsibility for her own mental well-being. You tried your best and whilst she had a difficult childhood she can\u2019t hold on to that anger forever. Could you have joint therapy?", "NTA, as far as I can tell. CJ has a LOT of issues dealing with her childhood and there not being enough. But I wonder what you are leaving out, OP.", "I don't understand CJ at all. NTA\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was 4 and I was raised by a single mom who was struggling and very similar to what you described. Do I wish it had been different? Sure, but I saw my mom was trying and doing her best and I don't need to punish her for being in a better place now after years of hard work.", "NTA.  daughter needs to grow the f\\*\\*\\* up.", "NTA. At the end of the day you have nothing to apologise for.  Possibly by feeling overly guilty you have played into her need for drama over the whole deal. She has simmering feelings of resentment that she wants to hang on those feelings, because she doesn't want to feel like her childhood was somehow because she was undeserving. Of course those aren't the only two options but trauma can make things seem black and white like that. Also when you have trauma you want to run the scenario over and over again in your mind, and she is drawing you into that rather than working on getting beyond that ceaseless over thinking. When you apologise it confirms her feelings of resentment.\n\nNot being able to buy fancy stuff or go on fancy holidays with your daughter does not make you a horrible mother. My family were poor. My best friend since high school was poor as a single parent bringing up a daughter and that daughter is strong, confident, happy and well adjusted. Both that daughter, and myself, have incredible respect for what our parents were able to achieve, for the stable upbringing we were provided when our parents had so little. We appreciated everything we got all the more and felt no resentment because our friends had 'better' toys or better holidays. We grew up knowing the value of things; both material, and in the way of treating people. My parents never apologised to me and I'd tell them to shut up (lovingly) if they did. \n\nSome kids end up feeling resentful. I have no idea whether this is because of something the parents did or not, that's where you perhaps need to see a therapist as well, and maybe with your daughter. But if it was something you did that made her feel resentful it wasn't the material situation of her childhood. There may be an emotional interpersonal reason that you both have a part in, or she may just be the personality that loves drama. Either way therapy should be able to help. But you should lay aside any hint of the idea that you failed to give her a full childhood, because material things are not what make a childhood full.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to see a therapist. You've apologized enough. She is an adult now, hasn't she learned that sometimes life just isn't fair? It sucks that she didn't have the childhood that her siblings now have but there is LITERALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT.", "I'm the CJ of my family. My sister and I (16 years apart) have had completely different upbringings despite being raised by the same person. I don't feel jealous or anything, mum is better off now and isn't a single parent anymore. NTA", "NTA. I've already started to understand about my mum's financial situation at the age of 10. I would never resent her for that. Maybe you did spoil her even when you were not good financially. What kind of 28 yo would be jealous of her own siblings for growing up in a better conditions? I'd be grateful that my siblings don't have to go through what I went through.", "Sounds like an ungrateful brat. Mother works hard to keep a roof over her head and food in her stomach while still putting her trough school. These other things are not necessities. She never needed a trip to Disney or a broadway showing of frozen. She needed food, clothes, a warm bed and an education. What a selfish, ungrateful brat.", "NTA. You couldn't do this when cj was a child, but you still invite and pay for her as an adult! So, yes, her brother got this for his 5th bday, but she as a 28 year old also got the same experience. She's getting to go now, you aren't leaving her behind and only taking the Littles. She needs to realize that she's almost 30 and with a 20+ year age gap with her siblings. They're being raised in a completely different generation with 2 parents instead of 1, so they were always going to have a much different childhood than she did. \n\nI'd stop inviting her to not ruin the mood for the Littles if she doesn't get therapy and stop bringing this up at their events. How petulant. Especially because it doesn't sound like she had a bad childhood, just not a rich one. Like, had you not had more children and just continued to spoil cj as an adult I bet she wouldn't have had a problem with her childhood. She'd just enjoy experiencing now vs never.", "NTA. \n\nCJ is not an AH for her feelings, but her behaviour certainly puts her in that territory.\n\nIt sounds like she needs some therapy around this, maybe some family therapy with you?", "NTA. \nCj seems to be lacking a certain level of maturity a 28 year old should have to not be able to move past this in a healthy way. \n\nIt's okay for her to have some sadness or regret that things weren't the same for her during her childhood, but her guilt trippy comments at her kid brothers birthday and calling you a horrible mother were so far out of line, it seems like she needs some therapy to deal with her feelings. \n\nShe should be happy her siblings are provided for and that she is being included in extra fun stuff.", "NTA you did the best you could at the time with what you were given. That's what I tell myself nowadays. Don't beat yourself up move on and if she doesn't like it then screw her and everyone else who doesn't like it.", "NTA While it's understandable that CJ feels frustrated that her younger siblings live a more material rich life than she did at their age it is completely unacceptable to be taking those feelings out on a child. CJ needs someone to talk to openly if she is willing. You did your best OP, I'm sure that while CJ's childhood wasn't rich in material things, it was rich in love. Older siblings tend to get jealous, the large age difference and financial circumstances certainly heighten that jealousy. Best of luck OP, you sound like a good mom trying their best.", "NTA - see if she\u2019ll get some counseling for the two of you. Tell her you understand her feelings but if she\u2019s not willing to be polite at these events she won\u2019t be asked to join you.", "NTA. You were struggling and did your best with whatever resources you had. You are making up to her now. She was definitely treated differently and with less privilege but  she is old enough to understand why it happened. You have already apologized and are including her in everything she missed out on. She can be upset all she wants but to ruin the mood at her siblings party out of jealous is 100% wrong. She is 28 not 8 or 18. A grown ass adult shouldn't be competing with kids.", "NTA. It's not like you maliciously deprived her of anything.  I don't see that you have anything to apologize for in the first place, ti's not like you went \"man, know what'd be a super fun time? Being a single mother on the edge of poverty!  What a blast.\"", "NTA\n\nI understand that CJ had a difficult childhood, but she is almost 30 years old. Her behavior and bitterness is very immature. Instead of being proud of her mom for doing her best even through some trying times, she has opted to be bitter and rude to her siblings. You can\u2019t change the past, I\u2019m sure if you could go back and give your daughter more you would have. It\u2019s time for her to grow up and get over her jealousy. It\u2019s time that she appreciates all you\u2019ve done for her", "NTA. She needs either friends or a therapist who listen to her rant.

Ask her if she wants to go see a therapist. Maybe talking to someone will help her. NTA!", "Hey OP, I'm writing this judgement from a kid with CJ's POV. My parents were new immigrant grad students with no family support who only figured out financial aid like 2 years after they immigrated. My first bed was a mattress on the floor that smelled like a dumpster. I was so happy about it anyways because it was a big kid bed. My younger sib is 10 years younger and born after my parents had two incomes and a house. She got this whole pretty pretty princess set for her first big kid bed. The kind that I dreamed about as a kid, but knew better to ask for, because we could barely afford groceries, nevermind luxuries like furniture.\n\nYou're 100% NTA. You did the best for your daughter that you could at the time, just like my parents did. My parents do try to keep things even between my sister and I financially, so they've always been generous with me monetarily when I've had a use for it and they were able, like buying a house or getting married, but they'd also do that for my sibling. Otherwise we get the same level of gifts, same invites on vacations etcetc. It's not about the money, it's about my parents care and attention, and I know I've always had the best of that, just like I'm sure your daughter has. If that bothers her, she needs to go see a therapist, but she absolutely shouldn't be taking it out on you or her half siblings. She cannot be an energy vampire at every social situation and she should be seeing a therapist, otherwise this will warp her and only stunt her future growth. Maybe offer to chip in for therapy beyond whatever her workplace might cover.", "Some things from childhood take forever to heal and the thing is she did not ask to be born, she was a trooper in her childhood and probably didn't throw too many tantrums and was forced to group up.

She once confided to me that her relationship with her eldest daughter became extremely tense and hostile after the youngest was born. She attributed this to the fact that the oldest was comparing not just their childhoods, but also how she (the co-worker) was as mother. In her own words, she was stressed, strict and \"un-fun\" as a teenaged single mom, whereas with the youngest she was in a secure relationship, and had way more financial resources to both give to the child, and also just smooth out some of the daily stresses from her life, which obviously just makes her a lot more chill mom this time around.\n\nPerhaps OP should do some introspection on whether she's treating the younger children the same as CJ, monetary things notwithstanding.  There is more to being a good parent than just being able to buy things. If, like with the case of my co-worker, CJ sees that the new kids are getting a gentler, kinder, more loving mother (because OP not all stressed out about money, debt and working as much as possible this time around), she is entitled to feeling negative emotions about this.

Has she still dept?", "INFO:Was she angry about the material difference, or about the time?  Because you gave your son a magical time--a show and a dinner with a family that loves him.

Or did you make some special time, like her favorite Mac and cheese and a cupcake with a candle and extra hugs?", "Idk\u2026 it sounds like from the tone of your first few paragraphs that you are just glossing over how horrible the life you provided for her was. Because it was. It was horrible. Not having any possessions, always being on the poverty line? You lived in poverty. You didn\u2019t live near the poverty line. I feel awful, too. Because that was her life. That was the life that you gave her. And it sucked.", "I can understand her resentment.\n\nShe\u2019s probably feeling bitter over being deprived of what she felt entitled to as her mothers child.

Sure, she has a long way to go in terms of accepting this reality - but it\u2019s obviously very hard for her.\n\nShe could be feeling inadequate over both her parents not be able to provide her the life she\u2019s witnessing her siblings living.

She got the short end of the stick and it seems like you are maybe going overboard with your second chance kids. Honestly, a Broadway outing for a 5 year old birthday is an awful lot, you may want to talk to a therapist. Might just end up with two super entitled kids and one angry one. 5 year olds go to the trampoline park for their birthday. NAH", "It sounds to me like CJ may be suffering trauma from growing up with such limited means. One comment that stands out is \"We definitely ate a lot of struggle meals and had to move often. We honestly teetered on the poverty line.\" Facing that struggle when you are a child can cause long lasting damage. Without discounting how difficult it may have been for you as well, you were at least a young adult so had more coping skills to survive that period.\n\nMy guess is when she sees you spending money on your children it triggers her feeling about being a child and having to go through that.\n\nShe's complaining about your current spending but it's common for trauma victims to focus on the trigger and not the underlying event because that's what is most present for them. What have you done to hear her story? Do you truly try to understand how she was affected by the struggles you went through? Do you dismiss them by saying \"it was the best I can do but it's behind us so let's move on?\"\n\nOn the financial side it's definitely N-T-A.

As you have had to before you must continue to live in this one and let her get it out, or accept she needs to get it out without you around", "Honestly, this is why most oldest children do not get along with their youngest siblings; their parental experience is just too different. \n\nI\u2019m an oldest. I grew up poor. I\u2019m talking played with a bag of buttons poor. What I got instead of material things was creativity and character. My Mom mixed flour with water, gave us safety scissors and an old Sears catalog, then laid butcher block paper (leftover from my Dad\u2019s job) onto the kitchen table, wrote letters on it, and had us cut and paste things under each letter. \n\nCJ needs someone to remind her of what she did receive and help her not focus on what she missed out on; that person isn\u2019t you, Mom. \n\nNTA", "NTA. CJ should, by this age, understand why you both struggled financially. She selfishly interrupted her 5 year old half brother\u2019s birthday to trauma dump. Also a Barbie doll as a gift from a cheap store is still a pretty nice birthday gift. CJ is a grown woman, she needs to talk to a professional rather than continually expressing her anger in an unhealthy way", "Honestly I'm going to say NAH. \n\nFor OP, she's obviously did all she could as a 17 year old mom with no support from CJ's dad or seemingly OP's own parents. She had to juggle student loans along with other debt (and props to OP for finishing *college* with a child!) However that brings the point to CJ. \n\nWith there being four years of college (and truthfully we don't know how long it took OP to finish college), CJ's formative years would have been spent with a mom who was stressing over how to make ends meet, projects for class, studying for exams and making sure her daughter had enough to survive. So a dollar store Barbie and presumably no birthday party with family like her friends were getting if she was in Kindergarten at 5 would have stung for a five year old ( I say 'if' for kindergarten because back when my parents were enrolling me, there was a cut off point, if your 5th birthday was after the cut off point, you had to wait until the next year). \n\nI'm also reminded of something my English teacher said in my senior year--that everyone in my class was born on a metaphorical third base with the ability to run into home. CJ was not born on third base and there's more of a disparity than just a five year old getting an off Broadway play for their birthday compared to a dollar store Barbie. \n\nDo Jack and Melissa get you to help with their homework? Presumably so unless you had to work late one day or something. CJ wouldn't have had that because of the fact you were (understandably so) working to get out of debt. Do Jack and Melissa have college funds? Did CJ *go* to college? If so, how much debt is she in right now because she had no financial assistance? But on top of all of that, Jack and Melissa get to grow up with a mom who's going to be 100% present whereas CJ never had that and she *knew* her mom was presumably stressed. \n\nWhen I was five, both my parents worked and my mom was pretty much a single mother 5 days out of the week because my dad was always traveling for his work. One day, I was playing Barbies and my mom was wondering why I was making the mom barbie say 'hurry up, hurry up, we're going to be late' and then she paused because she realized *that's what she was always saying to me*. After talking it over with my dad, she agreed to quit her job and be a SAHM. Yeah we had a financial hit but I was able to have a more relaxed childhood like what Jack and Melissa are getting with OP. And yes I know OP can't invent a time machine and go back to make CJ's childhood more stress free but it needs to be acknowledged. And it needs to be done more than once imo. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying it's anyone's fault (with the exception of CJ's father and OP's parents for not helping out--and honestly OP, if you know CJ's father's name, maybe use some of your discretionary funds to track deadbeat down for the child support he does owe CJ and use that as a down payment on a house or help pay for CJ's wedding or help pay off her student loans if she has them.) And CJ shouldn't be taking it out on her five year old siblings. At the same time, I think we can't pretend like it was *only* material items CJ missed out on (and will continue to miss out on as Jack and Melissa grow up) and it is natural to almost have a mourning period of what she missed because she didn't *know* that was an option to miss when she was growing up.", "NTA\n\nShe should not be dumping her resentment on the young ones. Or you for that matter. You did what you could at the time. While she may be bitter about it, what does she expect you to do? Since she mentioned that she would keep bringing it up and guilting you about it, it's high time she took matters into her own hands and sought therapy to deal with her issues. You should mention that to her and maybe start therapy for yourself. It can't be easy knowing your child resents you so much for something you could not have done differently. \n\n\nPersonally, having had a less than stellar childhood myself, I can't imagine being ungrateful like this to my parents. But trauma is different for different people, and all you can do is try and accept it or grow from it as best as you can.", "No, you're definitely not the asshole. You did what you could. I am in a similar position, and I don't hold it against my parents.

She doesn\u2019t pay for food or bills (just her own). She helps with her brothers but won\u2019t take the money unless we say\u2026 paid her to babysit while we went away for the evening. She won\u2019t just take money if I have an appointment or run to the store.\n\nShe works part time. \n\nShe understands that we\u2019re older, more secure, smarter, and have more life experience now.

No she didn't. She dragged me into poverty with her and poverty is traumatic. \n\nI'm so sick of being expected to hero worship my mom & have no hard feelings towards her now she has her \"do over\" babies that she actually *is* giving a beautiful life to. \n\nWe don't talk nearly enough about how the the siblings born much later in life after the teen parent has \"gotten their shit together\" are often viewed as the \"redemption\"/\"second chance\"/\"do over\" kids, and as if the kid who was born to the teen parents was just rough draft or crash test dummy to practice with until they were actually ready and willing to be a parent as opposed to getting \"stuck\" being a parent earlier than they wanted because the condom broke or an unplanned pregnancy happened.\n\nKids of teen moms are expected to view their moms as \"superheroes\" and say things like \"yeah it was so hard but I wouldn't change a thing, love was all I needed, I never felt like I missed out on anything\". If we dare say anything else, we are ungrateful assholes. It's quite unfair, because put simply, we did not ask to be born. I'm sure someone will call me an edgelord, but I did not ask to be born to a broke 18 year old, and as a literal child, I had no power or capacity to change or better my situation. My upbringing was out of my control. I quite frankly wish I was aborted rather than being raised in poverty like I was but \"consequences of your actions\" according to my conservative grandparents who were also teen parents (however they were mid 20s by the time she was born).\n\nI'm the first born in a similar story. I'm now 30/F, born to then 18/F (who didn't know who my father was because multiple guys that month) who now has IVF 5 year old twins with her 40-something year old partner with a good job.\n\nI grew up in poverty. Not middle class saying I'm poor because I don't live like the Kardashians. I mean poverty poverty.\n\nI wore clothes with holes in them that were too small because my mother couldn't afford to buy new ones yet, or second hand clothes I hated and didn't like because they were free. I often went to bed hungry because groceries had to be stretched thin to last the whole week because she couldn't afford more. I didn't get to do a single extra extracurricular growing up. I shivered in winter because we couldn't afford heating, and I grew up somewhere where it regularly dropped below freezing. As young as 7 or 8 I was often left home alone until 11pm while she worked another shift and that was fucking terrifying at that age. I only got to go to prom because I wore a friend's sister's dress from 2 years prior that happened to fit, and only started eating enough as a teen because a friend's mom would pack way more than my friend could eat so she could give it to me under the guise of \"I can't eat all this and don't feel like taking it home\". I knew it was charity, but was hungry enough to take it.\n\nThe thing that really lifted me out of poverty was getting a good job after college - and that was only because my home-state funds a generous program that gives tuition waivers at in state schools for economically disadvantaged students with a good high school gpa & and I got some scholarships for living costs, so I didn't need to take out many student loans. I had no college fund and if not for that program, my choices would have been a pile of debt or continuing the cycle of low paid work.\n\nMy mother met her husband when I was 19 and has openly said she's \"doing it right this time\" and I'm expected to just smile and say how great it is she's good mom this time, as if she basically didn't just say I was the one she messed up.\n\nOne of the hardest things I've heard her say was when she described my half siblings as the children she actually wanted.......she didn't say I was the one she was \"forced\" to have, but she didn't have to. I know she was forced to have me. I knew even before it came out when I was a teenager. As the kid of a teen mom, you always know you were an unplanned \"mistake\", but to hear it like that hurts.\n\nShe wanted my siblings. She didn't want me. I'm her punishment for her teenage rebellion.\n\nAs someone who grew up like that, it's actually really hard to watch your mother have other children and give them the childhood you deserved too but never got. And it's hard to be shamed when you express that.\n\nI would never say it to the children. I don't have any ill will towards them. Like me, they never asked to be here, and they can't help the circumstances into which they were born.\n\nBut I'm sick of having to pretend it's super awesome and I don't resent anything.\n\nAnd it's not even about presents and parties - it's just about little things like fact that their clothes are what they picked for themselves and fit them properly rather than having to wear clothes they hate because that is what was on clearance at Walmart at the end of last season or those were the hand-me-downs your mom's co-worker with a daughter a couple of years older than you but with a very different sense of style donated you. That they get enough to eat with every meal, and don't live in fear that they'll end up living in their car. There will always be an adult at home with them at night! Yeah I'm kinda jealous knowing they'll have college funds and have a lot more choice where they go while I had to settle for a \"anyone who can read can get in there\" state school, but that's not the real issue.

Living the way I did as a kid takes a huge emotional toll and was traumatic. I was entitled to food and housing security as a kid and I didn't get it.

I would never say it to the children, but I'm sick of having to pretend it's super awesome and I don't resent anything. And it's not even about presents and parties - it's just about little things like fact that their clothes fit and they don't have to wear clothes they hate because those were the colours and clothes on clearance, that they get enough to eat with every meal, and don't live in fear that they'll end up living in their car, and that an adult will always be home at night. Yeah it sucks to know they'll have college funds while I had to settle for a \"anyone who can read can get in here\" school, but it just sucks to have my feelings about growing up poor minimised.

It's also probably not only about material things, but being raised by a single mother when very poor is hard and a \"me-and-my-mom\" thing.  The only thing she really gets to bring away from that experience is the teamwork and tightness she had with her mom.  Everything else was crappy.... but NOW her mom is with her step-dad, with lots of money and TWO kids in a nice nuclear family.  Everything is so much better and it steals any of the good memories she has of her childhood.  These two kids have it so much better than she did and it hurts.\n\nThat being said, she's misplacing her unhappiness and does need therapy.  It will only continue to eat at her from the inside until she explodes from the unfairness of it all.

She likely didn't have the emotional support she needed to develop proportionate to her peers making her feel held back. Obviously her mom did everything she could, but unfortunately it wasn't enough, or at least the daughter doesn't view it as enough. It's now her responsibility to overcome the shortcomings of her childhood, and although the mom can't be blamed, she is in large part responsible for these feelings. Sure, she could and should just grow up, but I have to imagine watching the same person who just barely met your needs provide the best possible head start to someone else is infuriating. I can almost guarantee you this is the real heart of the issue, not the loss in quality of life, but the loss of her relationship with her mom, and the loss of the development she now sees others getting. There's simply no way to make that up, aside from maybe quality one on one time, something her mom still can't give because she now has another family to provide for.\n\nI understand both positions, and I'd say it's more NAH.", "If she was like 17 or something maybe I could see where this was coming from but like lady youre almost 30 let it fucking go and realize your mom tried.

Mom didn't have a great life back then either. NTA", "Honestly, NTA. It sounds like you gave CJ love, and you sound kind and caring and you validate her feelings. I also grew up poor, single mother, five kids, and though my basic physical needs were provided for, I did not get love from my mom, I got emotional abuse, manipulation, and two eating disorder. We\u2019re very low contact now, and I am happy with that decision. Boy would I be ecstactic to be in CJ\u2019s position. All I ever wanted from my mom was love and affection. I barely cared about anything else. I think you\u2019re right, CJ has no right to bring up her financial lack, especially at a birthday party for a five year old. I think I offer to pay for CJ to get therapy to see if she can work past her upset feelings, or maybe theres something else that is bothering her.

If we dare say anything else, we are ungrateful assholes. It's quite unfair, because put simply, we did not ask to be born. I'm sure someone will call me an edgelord, but I did not ask to be born to a broke 18 year old, and as a literal child, I had no power or capacity to change or better my situation. My upbringing was out of my control. I quite frankly wish I was aborted rather than being raised in poverty like I was but \"consequences of your actions\" according to my conservative grandparents who were also teen parents (however they were mid 20s by the time she was born).\n\nI'm the first born in a similar story.

Not middle class saying I'm poor because I don't live like the Kardashians. I mean *poverty poverty*.\n\nI wore clothes with holes in them that were too small because my mother couldn't afford to buy new ones yet, or second hand clothes I hated and didn't like because they were free. I often went to bed hungry because groceries had to be stretched thin to last the whole week because she couldn't afford more. I didn't get to do a single extra extracurricular growing up. I shivered in winter because we couldn't afford heating, and I grew up somewhere where it regularly dropped below freezing. As young as 7 or 8 I was often left home alone until 11pm while she worked another shift and that was fucking terrifying at that age. I only got to go to prom because I wore a friend's sister's dress from 2 years prior that happened to fit, and only started eating enough as a teen because a friend's mom would pack way more than my friend could eat so she could give it to me under the guise of \"I can't eat all this and don't feel like taking it home\". I knew it was charity, but was hungry enough to take it. \n\nThe thing that really lifted me out of poverty was getting a good job after college - and that was only because my home-state funds a generous program that gives tuition waivers at in state schools for economically disadvantaged students with a good high school gpa & and I got some scholarships for living costs, so I didn't need to take out many student loans. I had no college fund and if not for that program, my choices would have been a pile of debt or continuing the cycle of low paid work. \n\nMy mother met her husband when I was 19 and has openly said she's \"doing it right this time\" and I'm expected to just smile and say how great it is she's good mom this time, as if she basically didn't just say I was the one she messed up.\n\nOne of the hardest things I've heard her say was when she described my half siblings as the children she *actually* wanted.......she didn't say I was the one she was \"forced\" to have, but she didn't have to. I know she was forced to have me. I knew even before it came out when I was a teenager. As the kid of a teen mom, you always know you were an unplanned \"mistake\", but to hear it like that hurts.\n\nShe wanted my siblings. She didn't want me. I'm her punishment for her teenage rebellion. \n\nAs someone who grew up like that, it's actually really hard to watch your mother have other children and give them the childhood you deserved too but never got.

Yeah I'm kinda jealous knowing they'll have college funds and have a lot more choice where they go while I had to settle for a \"anyone who can read can get in there\" state school, but that's not the real issue.

My anger is the expectation I have no hard feelings about my childhood and be totally fine with growing up poor and feeling treated like a painting that my mother screwed up because it didn't turn out how she wanted with 6 colours so she tossed me aside and went out and bought 2 new canvases and a 72 color pack of paints so she could try again.\n\nAnd no, the answer is not to punish the new kids.\n\nJust validate how CJ feels and understand that jealousy and resentment are fair emotions for her to feel.\n\nI don't hate my mother, but I refuse to romanticise my childhood and pretend it was not traumatic so she can feel better about herself.", "This this this!  As a former educator, I can tell you that struggling single parents are often emotionally neglectful. Not because they're a-holes, but because they work so hard, there's literally nothing left to give to the child at the end of the day. This causes a lack of emotional development in the child and could be the cause of CJ still behaving like a jealous little girl. Her ego is not fully developed and her emotional intelligence isn't either. She's a little girl in an adult body. Having said that, she is an adult now and needs to participate in a healing program of some sort so she can learn how to process her emotions in an appropriate manner. \n\nOP is NTA. OP is also in a position to hire a family therapist and invite her daughter to attend. I hope she does so.", "These are great points and I\u2019m quite sure that it\u2019s not about the toys, but about the overall situation - the income disparity, OP\u2019s overall state of mind being a single struggling mother, having to move often, probably living in a not so great neighborhood, not having a dad around etc. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem like OP is completely oblivious to all this either. She\u2019s making an effort to include her daughter in the family\u2019s activities, she\u2019s throwing do-over bday parties, she\u2019s spending one on one time with her - thus giving her attention and acknowledging her feelings. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s blatantly telling her daughter to deal with her trauma on her own and going off to play family with her replacement kids.

OP said she became financially stable when CJ was 17 and immediately started making up for lost time and took her to Disney World before college. CJ's step sibling is only 5 which means there were a few years where it was just the two of them having those special times.

Inviting CJ to activities is not the same as being the subject if those activities. \n\nOP is not seeing that this is having a profoundly negative effect on her daughter and is pushing her away even more. CJ only has her mum, but her siblings have both parents. Maybe she is feeling insecure that she is losing her relationship with her mother? \n\nThere are many unknowns, but it sounds like OP needs to have a more thoughtful conversation with her daughter to understand what is going through her mind rather than insisting her previous apologies were adequate.\n\nAlso, it seems a bit unfair to dismiss the obvious emotional damage CJ has sustained from being deprived of an additional parent and a better childhood. Her siblings will be fine - as alluded to in OPs post. Both parents are present and they are well looked after.", "She does say that she took her to Disney World when she was 17.

I want to offer my 2 cents, from personal experience, on what you might be missing here.\n\nSome context: I have a younger brother who was sick for most of my childhood. Because of that, my mother wasn't really present in my life. She did her best, I know that, and I love her, but I was still neglected and this left wounds that are still not healed today. I'm going to a therapist because of this. Things are better now, I have a good relationship with her.\n\nOne thing the therapist asked me to do is to speak to her about how her not being there has hurt me and how it affects me still today. I haven't had this conversation with her yet, and don't know if I ever will. Partly because I know this will hurt her and I don't want to do that. But I'm also afraid of how she'll react. Will she spent her time giving excuses, defending herself, instead of listening to me? Will I be able to say my piece and be heard? Or will she be too busy talking to convince herself and me of how she did her best, how she's not a bad mom, etc (something she doesn't need to do, I already know that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I said I know it'll take time for her to heal from that.\r  \nI thought that was it\n\nYou thought one conversation would be enough to resolve this? Yes she needs to work on this on her own, probably see a counselor or something, but have you given her the space to be upset with you, with her childhood? When you guys talked, was it just you explaining to her you're sorry and what's done is done? Or did you hear her out? Did you ask her what she needs from you to be able to heal (instead of now, two years later, and you only asked if you should give less to others, making it seem like anything she might ask for seems unreasonable)? \n\nYour reaction when she came to you, and how you've treated this issue since, is why I haven't talked to my mom yet about this. The only difference is, I guess I'm better at bottling up negative emotions when I'm with her and things happen that upset me, which is why she never had to ask me about it. I wish I wasn't.", "NAH I think there is 3 side to the story. Reddit is quick to call CJ immature and jealous but my mom had me at that age and it\u2019s more then material things.

Like CJ, I didn\u2019t get extravagant gifts or vacations as a kid.

She\u2019s cut off her deadbeat husband and is finally achieving her dream of a successful midwifery practice; she\u2019s making good money now.

Mind we are at a thrift store and these boots are like 15$, in good shape and very cute(he was at the time wearing beat up hand-me-down shoes that were 2 sizes too big and literally falling apart) and he had GASPED UPON SEEING THEM.

I have so much trauma from my childhood and when I bring it up to my mom she completely disregards it and plays it down because it was hard and she tried her best. She absolutely did not. I am very happy that my younger siblings have a different childhood than I did. My mom seems to think she did her best and that I should be grateful. Now that I am pregnant with my first child, instead of being grateful and understanding where my mom was coming from, I am actually a lot angrier and more frustrated with how I was raised. The way my mom interacts with my half brothers is completely different than the dynamic we had. At the end of the day, it really isn\u2019t about the monetary aspect and the things the daughter physically lacked growing up.

I guarantee hearing her daughter\u2019s side of the story would change the public sentiment on this one.", "I think one duty of adult children is to recognize that their parents were human and give them a little grace sometimes. I had a parent who had anger issues and was verbally abusive at times. And yeah, I\u2019ve got some baggage from that. But my grandparents were verbally AND physically abusive AND neglectful. My parent didn\u2019t completely break the cycle of abuse, but they broke about 90% of it. That\u2019s a huge feat to undo that much of your programming and in many areas do a complete 180\u00b0 from how you were raised. I can forgive the rest. \n\nNow I\u2019m trying really hard to not pass that verbal abuse/anger stuff onto my kids. Which is a lot harder than I expected because kids are incredibly good at pushing all a parent\u2019s buttons. I still yell sometimes, but I work really hard at it, and it\u2019s less often than it used to be. I also can look back and see places where I made huge mistakes as a parent, but I was doing the best I could AND operating under doctor\u2019s advice!

No matter how much OP showers CJ with gifts now, she will likely never get to navigate the world with the kind of ease and confidence that the younger two children do - if she\u2019s anything like me, she\u2019ll be constantly haunted by those years of deprivation and feel like she\u2019s always one step away from being back in poverty. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have made that comment to Jack, and she shouldn\u2019t have told OP that she has the right to bring up her resentment whenever she wants.

I\u2019m one of 9, homemade clothes, no bathroom, no heat in my sleeping area, not enough blankets until I was 12 and we got a house. Hand me down clothes and shoes were the norm. The kids I went  to school with had so much more and while they had real Barbies I has some cheap knockoff. \n\nI don\u2019t think people realize how childhood poverty traumatizes and warps some kids. I was one of those. Took me years to feel like I was worth anything.\n\nMy youngest sister grew up differently. Some of the kids were out of the house, my dad retired and she got social security so she had braces, better clothes, etc. She has a much more positive sense of self than I ever will.  \n\nI as you, do  not hold this against my sister; she didn\u2019t ask to be born butI can\u2019t pretend it was all peachy either. It was actually pretty awful and one reason I didn\u2019t adopt a kid (I\u2019m single) was because I knew that while material things aren\u2019t everything they ARE important. I like yougot an education and a job to break that cycle.\n\nPeace.\n\nEdited for spelling errors.", "I totally respect your position and I'm sure it wasn't, and isn't, easy to be the child in this situation. But I'd like to point out that what your mother probably has mind racking guilt and heartache about the way you were raised. She has probably cried herself sick more times than you can count about what she put you through and I'm willing to bet that every time she gives her littles a party, or new clothes or a large gift it breaks her heart that she couldn't give it to you. I'm not telling you to \"get over it\" or not have hard feelings because that's just unfair. I'm just trying to give a bit of perspective of a person who was probably doing the best she could. I wish you the best and I'm glad to hear that you and your family were able to get out of poverty.", "Thanks for that last bit.

And the ones they do all together are probably more appropriate for kids then adults. Considering the huge age gap, I\u2019m not sure how something would be equally fitting for a 5yo and a 28yo. But I guess that\u2019s what happens when there are small kids in the family. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t want to assume that OP is the ultimate villain who abandoned her daughter by having her young and then meeting a man and having more children. Being an afterthought and feeling like one is not the same thing imo. I completely understand how CJ is resentful from seeing her younger siblings raised by a different version of their mother. But no parent-child relationship is ever perfect. At some point it comes to either sulking in your resentment and expecting mom to magically make everything bad go away based on the assumption that it\u2019s mom\u2019s fault and it\u2019s on her to fix things or coming to terms with the life she\u2019s had and has now and reconciling. It\u2019s a choice, not a preset condition. An adult relationship is always a two-way street. Judging from the info given, OP is not rejecting her daughter and isn\u2019t discounting her feelings which seems like a great start to reconciling their relationship. The reality is that it\u2019s not possible to go back in time and make things right, so it only makes sense to make the most of what they have today imo. We have only so much time to be kids to our parents unfortunately.", "Exactly. She can\u2019t go back. But she *can* do better now. It\u2019s not to say her oldest was a throw away but it\u2019s reality. What would adult children who feel this way rather happen? The mom not have more kids at all later? Not give things to the younger ones? She *cant* keep apologizing for being poor.", "I\u2019m thinking of not so much as an apology for doing something wrong but something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to provide you with all the things you wanted and deserved as a child, I acknowledge your feelings\u201d as a form of getting on the same page. OP was a child raising a child alone and she did a pretty good job by the sound of it. She didn\u2019t aimlessly bounce around with a kid in tow, she lead a pretty meaningful life while finishing college, paying off her debt and growing professionally. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t perfect by any means but you\u2019re right, everyone is dealt a different hand - you either come to terms with it and focus on the things you did have or you spend all of eternity simmering in the resentment.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nYou decided to raise a kid in poverty and yes that is a lifetime thing.

She was the child of a single teen mom. You were probably not great at all the parenting stuff all the time. Who watched her when you were at school? How was your discipline? When did you leave her  alone for the first time? Now you have a happy 2 parent do-over family where the kids lack for nothing. Are you different with them? Did they get the benefit of your mistakes with CJ? Think critically about her childhood and theirs in terms of what actually matters. Not gifts and vacations but time, care, discipline, etc.", "YTA. I was going to say that you're not the asshole, but thinking on it a little more I realised that you didn't once mention anything you do that involves just you and CJ, things that belong to just the two of you, and ways in which you devote time, attention, and money to just CJ. I'm sure everything's perfect for you now that you're building a family the normal way, and I'm happy for you, but I wonder how much resentment would still be building within CJ if she wasn't always treated like a hanger-on who just happened to be invited to your new family's fun adventures. Because currently she's just an outsider who happens to be invited on your new family's fun outings - as though she's being done a favour. Do you ever go on vacation with just her? Do you ever do fun activities with just CJ and no one else? Do you devote any time and resources to just her and no one else, so that you can actually make up for lost time with each other? How much do you do to make sure she feels special and taken care of in the same way you do for your current family? Is she always just a third wheel that joins your family on their fun day's out? Are all her invitations couched within the context of her being done a favour for missed time? How much of any of the new experiences in your new family life are geared towards CJ's happiness? Will she always be an outsider from the \"bad times\" within this family?\n\nCJ needs therapy, a lot of it, she needs to figure out a way heal and accept things the way they are now. Unfortunately her life growing up sucked, and the lives of her siblings are several times better and happier than hers was and that's the way it'll always be. They get to have better childhoods and better memories than she had, that's just the way it is.\n\nI'd recommend one final, written, document - a long and detailed letter (preferably both electronic and printed) to CJ that goes into an extensive admission of all the mistakes you made as a young parent, explain how little you were able to give her, and accept all the blame for not being able to be the parent to her then that are you are to your children today. Apologise that she didn't receive the things her siblings are getting, and freely admit that there is nothing you can do to take any of it back, don't justify anything, don't try to defend yourself, just explain as fully and as completely as possible that her feelings and experiences are valid and being seen and that you will always be sorry.\n\nYou should plan an annual trip with CJ, something that's just for you two and no one else, and you should invest more time into your relationship with her outside the new family, as I suspect they get a lot more of your attention and time than CJ does, and she's beginning to feel even more left out than she has been over the years.", "INFO: how many one on one vacations have you gone on with CJ since your other children were born?", "She has every right to be angry about being raised in poverty, with every disadvantage associated with it, along with you being an entirely different mother, than the one you are with your younger kids.

Now, I\u2019m not asking you to continually prostrate yourself for not being able to provide better in her childhood or for doing right by your younger children now, because that would be unfair and inappropriate.  But I am saying you clearly need to talk more with your daughter about what she missed out on.  What she\u2019s still struggling with.

Your younger kids deserve everything you can give them, don't feel the need to keep them wanting just because CJ had to want. I would also recommend that you pay for therapy for CJ for her personally, and group therapy for the two of you. My personal reading is that CJ feels like you want to move on (which you do, understandably) but these affects are going to stay with her forever and she's acting unreasonably because it's unfair. That's all true, but her actions won't increase the fairness. This cannot be solved here, but a great therapist will help. Last thing of note, you will have to realize and accept that you can't give CJ the closure she needs on this, and so will she.

My step- dad was low ranking in the military. Getting married didn\u2019t suddenly boost our lives. My mom bought my \u201cnew\u201d school clothes at the good will and in her defense, my sisters got plenty of used clothes during that time as well. When I was a teenager money for better for us, but it seemed like my mom still wanted to raise me like we were poor while splurging on herself. I\u2019m in high school and she takes me to Abercrombie and Fitch to buy herself new stuff while she buys my clothes at Walmart. I graduated and left home and my sisters get older. Now my sisters are getting holister and going to every school dance, they get new dresses, etc (things I had to work for or call my dad for). let me add that during this time my mom divorced my step dad and money got tight again, but her spending habits kept up. My step dad didn\u2019t send extra money for things because he paid child support. This all felt very hurtful to me that she raise me so poor, which was understandable, but go deeper in debt to raise my sisters with higher standards. I\u2019m not mad I raised poor. We were poor! I\u2019m hurt that she raised me poor when we weren\u2019t poor and showered herself with nice stuff.

How much of yourself you had left to share with her when she was a child after all the working and studying? How old was she when she stopped asking you for things because she knew she wouldn't get it? Did you have the same quality time with her as a child that you now do with your youngest children?

Have you ever really sat down and talked about it, or are you just stretching this conversation with little tidbits of hurt over the years?\n\nAnd maybe she would have never thought that her childhood was bad at all if now she did not have a comparison, because she and her siblings, while having the same biological mother, do not experience the same parent at all. Maybe she looks at you with them and sees what she could (should?) have had and didn't, and maybe comparing you as a mother now and you as a mother then, your past self is considered extremely lacking.

But it made me so much happier that their childhood was just as wonderful, but in a different way. My parents made sure they poured as much love into my childhood and I grew up to be the creative one in the family. My siblings are much more saavy than me financially, ironically. Even now, we have drastic views on what is considered a luxury, but I would NEVER hold my parent's circumstances against them. Your child is being a child.

Go somewhere that allows you two to focus on just you. The beach? The mountains? Somewhere that's condusive to PRODUCTIVE conversation.\n\nYes CJ is being resentful of a literal child, and may just be crying out ultimately for the attention she feels she never got. She's hurting too. She just may not know how to properly express it. Deep down, you likely still carry that guilt as well. . I can only assume that I may have been a little sour to any step siblings I could have had (my mother did not have any other children). but I see where she's coming from. It may be beneficial for her to talk to a therapist, just to help her communicate with you. Maybe you could even have some joint sessions.\n\nIf that's not your thing, then that's totally understandable. You've already apologized. You have admitted your mistakes, short comings, failures, etc. Its now up to her to try and understand your point of view. You can't fix the past, but you can try to recover and move forward.", "ESH\n\nI know you are trying to do right by your daughter, and I agree she is behaving like a petulant child, but you also need to understand what she is feeling, and I can empathize with that quite a bit because I am her. \n\nI was the \"crash test kid\" to my parents who split up not 9 months after I was born. \n\nMy mom went on to marry an engineer, pop out two more kids, and treated them better than she ever even attempted to treat me, despite having 50% custody of me until I was 13. She wasn't really present in my life and frequently would just leave me with my dad, citing that she couldn't handle 3 kids. I frequently was referred to as her \"daughter from her first marriage\" and even overheard her saying that she regretted having me with my dad because I was a \"constant reminder\" of my father, and she heavily implied I was the reason for the divorce. I was treated as the mistake from her first marriage.. This went on until I was 13 when she dumped me on my Dad for the 4th and final time. After I was gone, she took my brother and sister on trips to Universal Studios, Mexico, Disneyland, Washington DC, the whole 9. They always had the newest electronics, phones, clothes, cars, everything. The only thing my mom's new family and life was missing was the white picket fence. \n\nMy dad and I struggled financially until I was 17. Even though we were struggling, my dad always made sure my basic needs were met and taught me as many skills as possible so I would always have a job if something happened to me when I became an adult. Many of my fondest memories are of us spending time fixing cars together or learning how to garden, and some of the fun free leisure activities like weekends at the lake with my grandparents. My dad, despite remarrying when I was 16, never made me feel less than or burdensome the way my mother made a point to. \n\nTo this day, I resent my mother and siblings. I resent the fact that my mother chose to really love them and give them everything they ever could have possibly wanted. She made sure every little whim of theirs was met while I was given the cold shoulder, told everything I ever did was wrong, and dumped off with my father when she didn't feel like dealing with me. \n\nDo I need to be in therapy? OOOOH yeah. And I am. But I also have no contact with my mother because my therapist and I mutually decided that it would be best for me mentally. You did the best you could for your daughter, but now she feels like the \"trial kid.\" She probably feels like a mistake and feels slighted because it seems as though now that she's out of the way, you can love the kids you \"wanted\" properly.", "NTA and maybe see if you two can get some therapy separately and together because this kind of anger is not good for either of you.", "YTA because she was your first daughter and you and her suffered together, Now she sees this two kids(who are not at fault) getting that easy life she dreamed as a kid their age and it\u2019s hard for her to get passed it. It\u2019s hard because she can\u2019t hide her sadness from her childhood and she prob wants to forget but you keep rubbing it in with your gifts to your other children. I think you need to talk to her and ask her to go to therapy for herself and after that if she decides to step away from you or wants to fix your relationship for the better you have to accept her choice just like she had to accept her situation growing up.

I was lucky enough to have positioned myself to be able to do that, but I left everything I knew.
