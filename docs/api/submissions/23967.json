I\u2019m not due for a few more months, but I\u2019m a planner and like to have everything decided ahead of time. I was talking to my husband about how I want to do things differently this go around.\nWhen we had our first kid, my doctor told me that if it was at all possible I needed to stay off my feet for the first couple weeks. I\u2019m not sure if this is the standard or if it was because there were some issues with my placenta and I lost more blood than is considered to be the normal. \n\nEveryone who came to meet the baby told me they would be more than willing to hold the baby so that I could get some housework done. I remember feeling so alone and trying to juggle keeping myself fed and bathed while my husband wasn\u2019t home. There was a single visitor who showed up with groceries, washed my dishes, and made dinner. All before so much as glancing at the baby. I was so touched I cried. \n\nThis time we will have a toddler running around that I will also be having to care for. I want to request that visitors make themselves useful in at least a small way, rather than sitting on my couch for hours making harsh comments on the state of my house. \n\nDH says that I\u2019m being selfish and that while he doesn\u2019t see that I need to play hostess, they will be coming to see the new baby, not to check up on me. I told him if these people genuinely don\u2019t care about how I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m not sure I want them around first thing postpartum anyway. He told that was an AH outlook. Is he right? Am I just being selfish?\n\nEDIT: As I\u2019m getting many comments telling me to simply not invite people or not let them in I AM NOT THE ONE WHO INVITED THEM. My husband invited who he wanted without talking to me about it first. He is the one that called these people and let them into our home.

It sounds like you have a husband problem.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you would be the ass or not. I have never been in this position. Any one that visited me after I had kids never had to be ask to pitch in. My mil and fil included.\n\nThe people that come in and tell you one week your house needs to be cleaned are not going to help. But they will still come over. Your beating your head against a brick wall. It will never happen.\n\nWhat will happen is the following:\n\n\nThey are going to go to family and friends and tell them that you with held visits with the baby because they would not clean and cook for you.\n\nThey are going to tell everyone they where invited and you treated them like servants.\n\nThey are going to say your trying to come in between their son and grandkids because they would not cater to your requirements to see the baby.\n\nYour husbands friends will talk about you. After all they are going to see you as rude and lazy demanding free maid serves from guest that where invited.\n\nYour husband will freak out and make a scene. He will be little you. He is not going to stand this boundary. This will cause you issues.\n\nIs all of this stuff right and fair? NO but entitled people will not care if they are being fair.\n\n\nSo my suggestion is because you will be caring for a toddler when the time comes for you to deliver. Make sure your parents/siblings will be watching your toddler.  Start slowly sending things to your parents house that will be needed for recovery for your self, toddle and new baby. \n\n\nWhen the time comes to be released go to your parents home. Let your husband know the day off. You will be recovering at their house so you can help with the toddler.\n\nIf he resists ask him if he plans on spending the next 6 weeks on paternity leave. My guess is no. Then let him know while he is at work you do not feel like it\u2019s a safe option to be along with 2 kids under 3. Bonus points if you can arrange for your parents or sibling to bring you home.\n\nBecause either way there will be a fight. Either your husband will demand you keep up hosting his family and expecting you to do everything. Or you will set up this request and he will blow a fuse. Or you can simply go home with your parents a few weeks to recover. If he gets mad he gets mad. Tell him you offered him three solutions that work for you. He wanted none of them.

Your part of the problem is not getting him off his ass previously.", "Not selfish at all.\n\nPeople are very fond of the phrase \"*If I can do anything to help...*\", but when push comes to shove, you often discover they don't really mean it.\n\nI read a memoir once, a famous case of a woman who had been wrongfully convicted of murder, imprisoned, and then exonerated when new evidence came to light. She wrote of being released from prison after a few years, and returning to a house that was an absolute pigsty. Her husband, a pastor, had either been overwhelmed by the demands of running a house and caring for the children, or oblivious to them because he was so caught up in his work.\n\nShe had lots of visits from parishioners in the first few days, and they all said \"*If I can do anything to help...*\" She decided to see whether they meant it. She'd reply \"There is, actually. Can you please put on a couple of loads of laundry?\" or \"Can you please go through the fridge and chuck out the rotting food?\" or \"Can you please clean the toilet?\" And then she watched as the visitor suddenly remembered an urgent appointment, and left.\n\nYour needs during the postpartum period are what they are.

In return we simply stopped visiting because we are not welcomed, but our money and work is, and we're not okay with this. So obviously I'd never tell someone \"do that to others\". \n\nOn the other hand: if you feel the need to ask *guests* for stuff your husband should help you with - there is a major problem going on that you both should talk about or seek help for.", "NTA but your husband is a MASSIVE AH.", "This is not a AITA Post.\n\nThis a ShouldIGetDivorced post.\n\nYour husband is an abusive deadbeat. Get the hell out.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I feel like ESH. You shouldn\u2019t impose duties and chores on guest\u2019s because you decided to have another child. But also, the husband shouldn\u2019t be inviting folks over to visit when you\u2019re not capable to host or have an unclean house. I truly feel like husband should be taking care of a good chunk of the work or at least paying for a part time nanny or maid. With that said, I work a kinda physical job packing up peoples cars. I\u2019ve had multiple heavily pregnant women help me unload the huge carts of their groceries and necessities into their cars. Every time I tell them no please no I\u2019m on the clock I\u2019m getting paid for this, you need to relax. And they graciously just keep helping me. I want to tell them we\u2019re not allowed stops regardless so don\u2019t be doing this to make yourself feel better about not tipping. It\u2019s no biggie either way. You may have more dire health circumstances but I\u2019m just saying that basic chores can generally be done with multiple breaks on the kitchen chair or couch in general. You still have another child to take care of. They and their mess don\u2019t just go away because you got pregnant again. BUT!!! I think your husband should be handling anything you cannot do yourself unless you don\u2019t work at all. I do not think it\u2019s ok to impose chores on visitors unless you talk to them about it BEFOREHAND so they know what to expect. I also truly believe your husband shouldn\u2019t be inviting people over when he\u2019s not there to help out and oversee things. You\u2019re NTA. I feel like you should have some stronger boundaries in place. But also, you need to be keeping  an eye on the \u201ctoddler running around\u201d and stay safe in general. Keep this time to yourself if you can. I\u2019m a child free adult with no desire to have children, but if I did, best believe I wouldn\u2019t impose chores on them. I would simply say they cannot come visit at the moment or month. Goodluck OP! And congratulations", "I have never heard of this kind of situation.  Tell your husband to tun the guest list thru you.  If he invites visitors over, he should make sure the home is suitable for the visitors .  do not take out you husband's failing on your family and friends.

My mother would murder me if I showed up empty handed to a new parents\u2019 house.

Or does he think he's only good for a certain thing?", "I never get people who think when you visit a new baby that the mom is there to host you.\n\nYou are there to HELP.

With zero judgment or comments about the state of disarray.\n\nThe only time offering to hold baby is a good idea is if it's so mom can take time out for a nice shower.

No, please don't even speak, it hurts my head.  No, I need to hold baby.  My doctor says I might have recurring headaches for several weeks so I'm just going to stay quietly in bed with baby.  No, please go, as hubby is so busy cooking dinner and doing the dishes that sadly, he can't entertain you.\"\n\nAfter you've repeated this 6 or 7 or 40 times, perhaps your husband will get the picture.\n\nAnd, of course, do not allow any of the visitors to hold the baby.  Not for one second.  \n\nNTA, but don't ask others to do chores your husband should be doing or hiring someone to do for you.  He's the gigantic A in this scenario.

I mean you no disrespect. If I\u2019m coming to see someone\u2019s baby it is in order to congratulate my friend or family member on having a child and starting/continuing a family. No one is out here excited to meet up with random babies. You are supposed to be grateful for their visit and well wishes. No expectations except usually a small thing for the baby traditionally especially right after birth.

In my country we get eight days maternity care, where someone comes and cleans and teaches you how to care for baby (bathing, breastfeeding, etc) and partners now also get about six weeks of leave in total.

I can instruct them on where the snacks are and that's about it.
