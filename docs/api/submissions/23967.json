I\u2019m not due for a few more months, but I\u2019m a planner and like to have everything decided ahead of time. I was talking to my husband about how I want to do things differently this go around.\nWhen we had our first kid, my doctor told me that if it was at all possible I needed to stay off my feet for the first couple weeks. I\u2019m not sure if this is the standard or if it was because there were some issues with my placenta and I lost more blood than is considered to be the normal. \n\nEveryone who came to meet the baby told me they would be more than willing to hold the baby so that I could get some housework done. I remember feeling so alone and trying to juggle keeping myself fed and bathed while my husband wasn\u2019t home. There was a single visitor who showed up with groceries, washed my dishes, and made dinner. All before so much as glancing at the baby. I was so touched I cried. \n\nThis time we will have a toddler running around that I will also be having to care for. I want to request that visitors make themselves useful in at least a small way, rather than sitting on my couch for hours making harsh comments on the state of my house. \n\nDH says that I\u2019m being selfish and that while he doesn\u2019t see that I need to play hostess, they will be coming to see the new baby, not to check up on me. I told him if these people genuinely don\u2019t care about how I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m not sure I want them around first thing postpartum anyway. He told that was an AH outlook. Is he right? Am I just being selfish?\n\nEDIT: As I\u2019m getting many comments telling me to simply not invite people or not let them in I AM NOT THE ONE WHO INVITED THEM. My husband invited who he wanted without talking to me about it first. He is the one that called these people and let them into our home.

It sounds like you have a husband problem.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you would be the ass or not. I have never been in this position. Any one that visited me after I had kids never had to be ask to pitch in. My mil and fil included.\n\nThe people that come in and tell you one week your house needs to be cleaned are not going to help. But they will still come over. Your beating your head against a brick wall. It will never happen.\n\nWhat will happen is the following:\n\n\nThey are going to go to family and friends and tell them that you with held visits with the baby because they would not clean and cook for you.\n\nThey are going to tell everyone they where invited and you treated them like servants.\n\nThey are going to say your trying to come in between their son and grandkids because they would not cater to your requirements to see the baby.\n\nYour husbands friends will talk about you. After all they are going to see you as rude and lazy demanding free maid serves from guest that where invited.\n\nYour husband will freak out and make a scene. He will be little you. He is not going to stand this boundary. This will cause you issues.\n\nIs all of this stuff right and fair? NO but entitled people will not care if they are being fair.\n\n\nSo my suggestion is because you will be caring for a toddler when the time comes for you to deliver. Make sure your parents/siblings will be watching your toddler.  Start slowly sending things to your parents house that will be needed for recovery for your self, toddle and new baby. \n\n\nWhen the time comes to be released go to your parents home. Let your husband know the day off. You will be recovering at their house so you can help with the toddler.\n\nIf he resists ask him if he plans on spending the next 6 weeks on paternity leave. My guess is no. Then let him know while he is at work you do not feel like it\u2019s a safe option to be along with 2 kids under 3. Bonus points if you can arrange for your parents or sibling to bring you home.\n\nBecause either way there will be a fight. Either your husband will demand you keep up hosting his family and expecting you to do everything. Or you will set up this request and he will blow a fuse. Or you can simply go home with your parents a few weeks to recover. If he gets mad he gets mad. Tell him you offered him three solutions that work for you. He wanted none of them.

Your part of the problem is not getting him off his ass previously.", "Not selfish at all.\n\nPeople are very fond of the phrase \"*If I can do anything to help...*\", but when push comes to shove, you often discover they don't really mean it.\n\nI read a memoir once, a famous case of a woman who had been wrongfully convicted of murder, imprisoned, and then exonerated when new evidence came to light. She wrote of being released from prison after a few years, and returning to a house that was an absolute pigsty. Her husband, a pastor, had either been overwhelmed by the demands of running a house and caring for the children, or oblivious to them because he was so caught up in his work.\n\nShe had lots of visits from parishioners in the first few days, and they all said \"*If I can do anything to help...*\" She decided to see whether they meant it. She'd reply \"There is, actually. Can you please put on a couple of loads of laundry?\" or \"Can you please go through the fridge and chuck out the rotting food?\" or \"Can you please clean the toilet?\" And then she watched as the visitor suddenly remembered an urgent appointment, and left.\n\nYour needs during the postpartum period are what they are.

No culture in the world expects that.", "No, it\u2019s that you should put your foot down and tell you husband, \u201cif you want to keep seeing your children, knock it off. If you dont, I\u2019ll file for divorce\u201d.\n\nAlternatively, when people show up, turn them away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not having visitors right now. Oh? Husband told you to come over? Well I\u2019m sorry but he is well aware I told him I am not entertaining any guests for at least X weeks.

You want to hold the squishy newborn.\n\nBuuuutttt, you aren\u2019t going to win this beyond close family (if even then) because people are there to meet/greet the baby.\n\nI think it\u2019s an ESH. \n\nSuper rude of everyone to NOT help and bitch about your house state.\n\nBut it is also really tacky to make visitors do something for you.\n\nI\u2019d just say no guests until X date.", "When these visitors arrive and your husband lets them in, excuse yourself and have a shower or take a nap. Or just rest in your room. Let your husband entertain them while caring for your baby and your toddler.

Show a little extra love and attention to Toddler _____. He/she loves the play ______ or watch _______. We want to make sure he/she also feels special. \n\n5. Blah blah blah you get the idea. \n\nRules outside the front door set the tone for YOUR HOME and limit the amount of conversation you need to have about it. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like it can return another time.", "So,  instead of addressing the issue of your husband inviting too many people too freely, you're going to create a set of rules that makes it clear to your guests they aren't welcome?\n\n\nWhat?", "INFO\n\n> I told him if these people genuinely don\u2019t care about how I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m not sure I want them around first thing postpartum anyway.\n\nWhat about what the baby wants?", "NTA at all. For the first month postpartum anyone coming to visit home should be cleared through you first you are in a very vulnerable state at that point. I think you are well within your rights to say if you want to just meet and hold the baby please wait until I am in better condition to have company. If you would like to come to offer help that is always welcome anytime.", "You are NOT being selfish in the least. \n\nIMO the only people who should be coming to visit and stay longer than 30 minutes for the first several weeks are those who are actually willing to help and not park their ass on the couch hogging the baby and expecting to be waited on  \n\nNope. \n\nThe people who come should  in your case be willing to amuse your toddler, run the vacuum, do a load of wash, yes hold the baby while your husband focuses on you getting an actual shower, etc. And blessed be those who are willing to bring or cook a meal for your family. \n\nOf course you can help yourself before you deliver.  If you have a freezer with room and assuming you eat meat cook big batches of it then break it down to store in freezer bags with say 4 servings in each bag.  Then you can use that meat served with rice and vegetables made fresh.", "I\u2019m a Labor and Delivery nurse of many years, and I cannot recommend more to NOT HAVE VISITORS for the first few weeks. This is important bonding and breastfeeding time, and getting your older child acclimated. DEMAND that your husband follow this instruction. If he balks, remind him that HE DIDN\u2019T HAVE THE BABY, YOU DID! And if he doesn\u2019t listen, and invites people over, go in the bedroom with the baby and close the door and DON\u2019T COME OUT. PERIOD.", "Ywnbta. When I was freshly released from the hospital after having my son, almost every single neighbor even if I didn't know them brought us food for the first 2 weeks until we were situated.

I don't know how you could word this request. \n\n>I\u2019m a planner and like to have everything decided ahead of time.\n\nSince you are the planner talk to some close friends and family and ask for help with chores the first couple of weeks instead of a gift for the baby.", "Try to get your husband to understand you will need time to heal. That it will be a few weeks until you will be up to cooking and probably a few months before you start to be able to tackle your usual jobs. This is normal!!  \n\nTrying to heal while dealing with lack of sleep is grueling!  If your husband won\u2019t help while you\u2019re recovering then you may have to hire somebody. Do your best to find someone before the baby comes. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t or won\u2019t comprehend that having guests makes everything harder for you and compensate for that than you have no choice but to decline guests. You should also prepare by making sure they know the acceptable length of the visit before they come.  Put a start and end time to the invitation. If they linger and won\u2019t take a hint tell them thanks for coming but you need to relax alone with the baby now. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for a lot of people to drop off prepared meals for family with a newborn but his family might not do that type of thing.", ">And I am sure it will be the same this time also.\n\nIf you like to be so proactive, tell him not to do this instead of just being sure it will be the same this time. Insist on no visitors. Do not let them in.\n\nIt would be nice if they wanted to help you with chores or meals but you really have no right to insist they do. I guess you can request it, but then what happens when they say no?\n\nIt seems like it would be better for you if they just were not there", "If he insists on doing this and the guest show up say you aren't feeling well and need your rest and so does baby then go in your room and relax with the baby. If he's not going to consider your feels as a new mom then he can entertain them alone.", "Sounds like your husband is more of a problem than your visitors", "Lol HE invited them? Hahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha\n\nNTA", "My friend, this is not about the chores. Your husband is being overtly cruel to you. HE should be helping with chores and to invite people into your space while you recover from CREATING A PERSON is so needlessly punitive...especially when he's shaming you for needing help! You deserve support and love and he is giving you neither.", "Dude nobody cares about your baby.. they're coming to see it to be nice to you and supportive. Why are you trying to punish them for it? Lol YTA. I cant imagine. Going to see someone's baby is already a chore.. if I have to do more chores on top of that I'm definitely just not going.", "NTA, and honestly I\u2019m debating doing this now when I have kids. That\u2019s a good idea, I hope more expecting mothers start incorporating this into their post birth plans.\n\nHowever your husband sucks though and I suggest finding a new one. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries and is more than ready to put you under pressure to show off his prized new baby, regardless of your thoughts, feelings and health. Red flags are ALL over the place here.", "YTA. NGL, if you\u2019re expecting me to punch in when I come visit\u2026I\u2019m just not gonna visit. You want me to watch the kids for a couple hours on Saturday? Can do! You want to make my visit conditional on which and how many chores I\u2019m going to do while I\u2019m there? Nah, I\u2019ll just see ya at Christmas. I\u2019m not going to tell you to your face either, you just probably won\u2019t see or hear from me for a while. If your goal is to push family and friends away, this will 100% do the trick.", "No, if they don\u2019t offer, you can\u2019t ask. YWBTA. \n\nBut you can say \u201cno\u201d to visitors if you don\u2019t feel like it.  If you feel like you can\u2019t, you have a husband issue.", "You are NOT, NTA.  I am devastated for you:  a break from your baby so you can do housework???  That is absolutely ludicrous; you are not a factory.  \n\nYour husband needs to get checked.  He can clean the house for his guests.  If anyone wants to comment on the state of your house, redirect them to Your Husband.  \n\n(You can also say, no new guests until later, due to the potential of passing on harmful viruses.  Yes, that is a legit excuse and I bet your pediatrician would back that up.  Science often trumps these scenarios.)", "Sometimes my husband being a private person comes in handy. I couldn't imagine having a partner who invited everybody over to the house after going through such a vulnerable and hard time. It's very selfish. You need to speak up or he'll keep thinking this is ok.", "Your husband does not respect you. He should be cleaning the house.", "NTA. If you are having a baby shower or sprinkle maybe ask for commitments for help instead of material things.", "NTA", "Sounds like l the real problem is your husband and his lack of respect for you in your  postpartum time. Your solution of asking visitors for a chore or a meal is not the right solution, sorry. The solution is for your husband to allow you time to rest without visitors.  YWBTA.", "Nta. Seems reasonable to me.", "They seriously offered to hold the baby, so you could tend to your house?  Are you bloody kidding me?  What kind of a-holes do you people call, \"friend,\" in your neck of the woods? \n\nMake sure it's in boldfaced font in the invites! Hell, I'd make a list of things that need done, that you're not physically capable of doing just yet.\n\nPeople do all that and more when someone's loved one leaves the world...I see ZERO reason why it shouldn't apply when a new life comes IN to it!\n\n\nCreative and brilliant idea...NTA, and your husband can go hiking on Hushify Mountain!", "Absolutely this. Also make sure you throw in that it's really overwhelming to have visitors when you have no help with housework, cooking or giving the toddler needed attention because your husband expects you to do it all regardless of doctor's orders.\n\nYour husband, BTW, is a first class AH.", "Don\u2019t forget to let them know what the doctor said about strict bed rest.

Shout out to my ex-sil who cleaned my house while I was in the hospital, but my ex husband was less than useless, and he and my dad got into a drunk pissing contest when my son was a week old, in my living room. Luckily my younger brother saw what was up and stayed the night to help out. All I actually needed him to do was sit and talk to me when I was up for night feedings, which was amazing, but I also woke up to his amazing chicken katsu, and my kitchen being cleaner than it had ever been.", "Im my family, we don't have to do anything because every time you get a baby, someone comes to your house for ten days.
