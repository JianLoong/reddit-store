I\u2019m not due for a few more months, but I\u2019m a planner and like to have everything decided ahead of time. I was talking to my husband about how I want to do things differently this go around.\nWhen we had our first kid, my doctor told me that if it was at all possible I needed to stay off my feet for the first couple weeks. I\u2019m not sure if this is the standard or if it was because there were some issues with my placenta and I lost more blood than is considered to be the normal. \n\nEveryone who came to meet the baby told me they would be more than willing to hold the baby so that I could get some housework done. I remember feeling so alone and trying to juggle keeping myself fed and bathed while my husband wasn\u2019t home. There was a single visitor who showed up with groceries, washed my dishes, and made dinner. All before so much as glancing at the baby. I was so touched I cried. \n\nThis time we will have a toddler running around that I will also be having to care for. I want to request that visitors make themselves useful in at least a small way, rather than sitting on my couch for hours making harsh comments on the state of my house. \n\nDH says that I\u2019m being selfish and that while he doesn\u2019t see that I need to play hostess, they will be coming to see the new baby, not to check up on me. I told him if these people genuinely don\u2019t care about how I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m not sure I want them around first thing postpartum anyway. He told that was an AH outlook. Is he right? Am I just being selfish?\n\nEDIT: As I\u2019m getting many comments telling me to simply not invite people or not let them in I AM NOT THE ONE WHO INVITED THEM. My husband invited who he wanted without talking to me about it first. He is the one that called these people and let them into our home.

It sounds like you have a husband problem.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you would be the ass or not. I have never been in this position. Any one that visited me after I had kids never had to be ask to pitch in. My mil and fil included.\n\nThe people that come in and tell you one week your house needs to be cleaned are not going to help. But they will still come over. Your beating your head against a brick wall. It will never happen.\n\nWhat will happen is the following:\n\n\nThey are going to go to family and friends and tell them that you with held visits with the baby because they would not clean and cook for you.\n\nThey are going to tell everyone they where invited and you treated them like servants.\n\nThey are going to say your trying to come in between their son and grandkids because they would not cater to your requirements to see the baby.\n\nYour husbands friends will talk about you. After all they are going to see you as rude and lazy demanding free maid serves from guest that where invited.\n\nYour husband will freak out and make a scene. He will be little you. He is not going to stand this boundary. This will cause you issues.\n\nIs all of this stuff right and fair? NO but entitled people will not care if they are being fair.\n\n\nSo my suggestion is because you will be caring for a toddler when the time comes for you to deliver. Make sure your parents/siblings will be watching your toddler.  Start slowly sending things to your parents house that will be needed for recovery for your self, toddle and new baby. \n\n\nWhen the time comes to be released go to your parents home. Let your husband know the day off. You will be recovering at their house so you can help with the toddler.\n\nIf he resists ask him if he plans on spending the next 6 weeks on paternity leave. My guess is no. Then let him know while he is at work you do not feel like it\u2019s a safe option to be along with 2 kids under 3. Bonus points if you can arrange for your parents or sibling to bring you home.\n\nBecause either way there will be a fight. Either your husband will demand you keep up hosting his family and expecting you to do everything. Or you will set up this request and he will blow a fuse. Or you can simply go home with your parents a few weeks to recover. If he gets mad he gets mad. Tell him you offered him three solutions that work for you. He wanted none of them.

Your part of the problem is not getting him off his ass previously.", "Not selfish at all.\n\nPeople are very fond of the phrase \"*If I can do anything to help...*\", but when push comes to shove, you often discover they don't really mean it.\n\nI read a memoir once, a famous case of a woman who had been wrongfully convicted of murder, imprisoned, and then exonerated when new evidence came to light. She wrote of being released from prison after a few years, and returning to a house that was an absolute pigsty. Her husband, a pastor, had either been overwhelmed by the demands of running a house and caring for the children, or oblivious to them because he was so caught up in his work.\n\nShe had lots of visits from parishioners in the first few days, and they all said \"*If I can do anything to help...*\" She decided to see whether they meant it. She'd reply \"There is, actually. Can you please put on a couple of loads of laundry?\" or \"Can you please go through the fridge and chuck out the rotting food?\" or \"Can you please clean the toilet?\" And then she watched as the visitor suddenly remembered an urgent appointment, and left.\n\nYour needs during the postpartum period are what they are.

But typically there won\u2019t be any leftovers so I\u2019ll be having snacks only while he\u2019s not home.", "I don\u2019t claim that I wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for asking them to help, but I\u2019m not the one that lets them in. I am not given an option. My husband invites who he wants and lets them in without any say so from me.", "I am not in control of who my husband lets into my house without my consent", "This makes no sense. Maybe she\u2019d be just fine without all the people in her house not giving a f*ck about her?", "Taking care of kid is not the same as fresh post partum dealing with household and childcare.", "You think the decision about whether to have a second child should be based entirely off whether or not postpartum was easy?", "Anyone who visits a new mom and isnt willing.to help is trash.", "I'm not sure you have a visitor problem. I think you have a husband problem.\n\nHe should not be inviting anyone over during this time without checking with you first, and he should be making it clear to his parents that they cannot show up unannounced.\n\nI'd be making this my hill to die on. The postpartum period is hard enough to get through, even with heaps of support. Your husband is not only doing very little to make it easier for you, he's actively doing things that make it harder.", "Why do you put up with that?", "HAHAHAHA not only did he invite people without asking you after your body just went though a major trauma but then he expected you to change for them?!?! Oh FUCK that, that is completely unacceptable behavior.", "You should get your doctor to put some fear into him about those germs to see if he leaves you alone at least for the first week. If that doesn't work lock yourself and the baby in your room until the visitors are gone and cite those concerns as the reason, bc then if they complain they'll 100% be the AH.", "Wow. You\u2019ve said that so many times.", "This is a communication problem with your husband. Tell him having a lot of guests makes you feel overwhelmed. Compromise on who is coming over and when before you have the baby. You can then ask those people tactfully if they will bring a dish when they come.", ":-)  That was probably my bias entering in. I like good food and tend to think that I will enjoy a better meal if I cooked it (at least in my home, that is the case). Plus, I automatically try to prepare enough for leftovers.", "So it\u2019s ok if YOUR friends/family come see the baby, but DH\u2019s friends / family have to be your servant if they come over? You are the/an asshole.", "You're married. They ARE your relatives. That's what marriage is.", "And during those three hours you could have eaten and showered.  You sound super ungrateful", "Ah, okay. The edit is important.", "Making yourself useful when in the house with a new baby is manners 101. I learned it when I was 9. Babies are exhausting and don't sleep well and parents have to care for them at all hours, they're done.\n\nI don't know where OP lives/is from, but the norm in the states is to bring something to help or do something to help. A meal (anywhere from a full pan of lasagna to a couple pizzas). Wash the dishes. Clean toilets. My job was to play with the older kid (under 5, kept us both out from underfoot) and my mother sat on the couch folding laundry and talking to the new mom.\n\nOP is ABSOLUTELY in the right if she kicks every guest out for making her life harder.", ">My husband invites who he wants and lets them in without any say so from me.\n\nYou need to set boundaries with your husband.", "why cant they hold the baby while he does the chores then?", "You have a husband problem.", "You are 100% in control of whether or not you stay with a husband that completely disrespects you and your needs when you are in a vulnerable state after giving birth.", "Then it sounds like an issue with you and your husband, not with the people who are visiting.", "You can't go to your room with baby when unwanted people come over?", "No but I think it\u2019s something that should be given considerable consideration", "Because evidently no one wants to read the edit. I just keep getting told I should stop inviting people.", "To be honest, I\u2019m the same but if I was having kids I\u2019d probably have stocked the freezer with meals. And I\u2019d have a no guests policy until I was ready to entertain.", "My friend came over and helped me voluntarily before holding the baby. My parents brought food on multiple occasions without being asked.  I didn\u2019t invite my extended relatives over until I felt capable of being a hostess. I don\u2019t mind if anyone comes to see the baby if they treat me like a human. But anyone who has the guts to tell a one week postpartum mom that she isn\u2019t doing a good enough job as a housekeeper isn\u2019t considered welcome in my book.", "Please point to where OP said it's only DH's family/friends who will have to do chores for her, while any of her own family/friends that she invites will get a free pass to sit and do nothing.", "I did eat and I did shower. But you know what I wasn\u2019t capable of doing? An entire load of laundry, a sink of dishes, or making a meal. I was only able to stand for about 5 minutes at a time.", "I don\u2019t disagree at all. But the problem\nIs the husband not backing her up.\n\nI just mean that the husband os the problem here. Anyone that doesn\u2019t feel like they should contribute with out being asked. They are not going to feel shame when she mentions it. \n\nThey are going to play her off as the controlling, lazy, crazy lady that was being rude to them when they where invited by their son to spend time with his new growing family. \n\nThese people are not going to do what she want. They are going to create a narrative and spread it around like op is the problem.\n\nHusband is not going to enforce this boundary and play up the part she can\u2019t care for the kids and is crazy. \n\nJust saying if she is not careful it will backfire.", "It becomes the visitors\u2019 issue.", "It\u2019s no help at all. You could try barricading yourself and the baby in your bedroom until you get a report that each guest has done a chore.", "Who commented on your housekeeping skills?  If they did, they\u2019re just rude. But that doesn\u2019t mean they should become your servant. They should just keep their mouths shut. DH gets to be excited about the new baby and have his friends/family over. Perhaps he is the one that needs to clean.", "Then your husband should have stepped up and help.", "In your post you make it sound like you were struggling to eat and bathe, I\u2019m just pointing out that you had opportunities to do this", "Here's a possible script:\n\nYOU (wearing a pretty negligee if possible):  Oh, how lovely of you to visit!  Would you rather load the dishwasher or vacuum {STATE WHAT YOU NEED\\* while I shower?\n\nYOU (looking like the dog's dinner with eyes brimming with tears):  Oh, how lovely of you to visit (BIG SNIFF).  Would you please \\[fill in the blank\\] for the next two hours while I nap?", "No. She places it onto the visitors, making it their issue. What she really needs is to create boundaries with her spouse: the root of this whole problem.", "His mother, his father, his sister, and all of his friends. Literally everyone he invited.", "'HUSBAND said you could come in when I said no, so you're going to have to entertain yourself because DOCTOR said I need to rest' or 'HUSBAND invited you after I said no, so I need you to leave' will still get backlash. Odds are huge the visitors will get involved at some point, but she won't be TA for holding her boundaries when her husband ignores them, even if everyone thinks she is.", "So tell him to clean the house before they come over.", "All I\u2019d say here is to not over extend yourself for anyone. If in-laws don\u2019t have the common sense and humanity to understand that a new mother can\u2019t keep an immaculate house & be an amazing hostess- you are not obligated to extend any courtesy to them. Stay silent and let your husband deal with the hosting duties for people he invites.\n\nAlso applicable to your nap time and baby\u2019s"]}
