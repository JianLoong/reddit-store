I\u2019m a pretty good looking guy who tries to be as social and open to everybody that I get to deal with, from the start it was quite obvious my colleague wanted something from me that she couldn\u2019t find at home. When I knew her for just 2 weeks she already told me that she doesn\u2019t want to be with her husband no more but she stays with him for the kids and other personal stuff. I always tried to not read into it to much but it was getting so personal I told her it made me uncomfortable and she stopped for a few weeks.\n\nNow at our company we have a lot of parties and there is generally a lot of drinking going on. My girlfriend already had the same feeling when she went along on one of the parties and told me I should avoid her as much as possible whenever there\u2019s alcohol involved. I already turned my colleague down a lot of times but this time it was different. \n\nShe literally threw herself on me and told me she wanted to fuck me on the spot, just like any other times I turned her down but this made her even more frustrated, I told her to leave me alone and I went home early from the party. I didn\u2019t tell my girlfriend yet because I don\u2019t want her to worry even more.\n\nI really like my job and my other colleagues but given the position my colleague is in it is hard to not talk with her as she is one of the managers here. I tried to tell my boss but he told me to not think to much of it and if it was a big problem I should tell her.\n\nSo to the point of this story as it already takes to long, today I told her that she should stay away from me at parties and that she should only talk to me if it is work related. Maybe I was an asshole for telling her to go to an sexworker if she really needed someone to het her off.\n\nObviously she got really mad and told my boss the things I said, so now I have a meeting with my boss and my manager about this whole situatio. She already works more than 15 years for this company so I got a feeling that this is not going to and well.\n\nSo my question is actually should I not have said anything and am I the asshole for telling her to find a sexworker?", "created_utc": 1694081431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cbzg5/aita_for_telling_my_colleague_to_go_find_a/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's been sexually harassing you from the beginning, and make sure you tell HR how many times you rejected her and that you even took your girlfriend to an office party once to demonstrate you were unavailable. And to no avail. \n\nAbout her looking for a sex worker, it's no different than her telling you to fuck her then and there. Actually, much worse what she did.

Then demand a good severance pay. .", "From a former Director of HR: \u201cBoss and Other Boss, I realize what I said was inappropriate and I should have approached this conversation differently. However, over the last year, coworker has been sexually harassing me. I did not report this behavior as I believed I could deal with it myself. I see now that I should have reported this. I have written down what she has said to me, both at the workplace and at company events outside of regular business hours. Most concerning, at the most recent event she physically threw herself at me and told me she wanted to eff me where I stood.  I take full responsibility for my single comment, and I am happy to because her reporting my one comment has allowed me to come forward with the multiple comments she has made.\u201d \n\nNTA. \n\nThis is a he said she said situation. If you have any written proof (texts, dms, emails, etc), print them and bring them with you. If you can show she contacts you outside of business hours (phone records), print and bring. Also write down who else has witnessed her behavior or heard her comments. Frankly, if she\u2019s done this to you she\u2019s likely done this to others. You will need to professionally insist that her behavior be investigated and that she be cautioned to cease her inappropriate behaviors.", "NTA. She\u2019s repeatedly taken it too far. This is sexual harassment. Sure your  comment was insensitive, but you don\u2019t owe politeness to a person refusing to take the hint.\n\n1 Document everything! Even if you just write a note and date it. Documentation is the only thing that can really help you.\n\n2 tell your gf. If she finds out you were hiding it, even if your intentions were good, she could think you\u2019re hiding this from her for nefarious reasons.", "NTA - but the sex worker comment wasn't great.\n\nShe's sexually harassing you.\n\nYour boss is aware and did nothing.\n\nDo you have a union rep?", "What type of business is this? She\u2019s 31 but been there for 15 years.. so it\u2019s not a company where you need a degree or to be 18. NTA. Lay it out and if you have proof provide it.

Remember HR is there to protect the company\u2019s interests.", "NTA, but an impolitic statement. She has repeatedly sexually harassed you. Do you have witnesses? I doubt she told her bosses what you said. She probably accused you of harassment.

Your comment about find a sex worker was out of line but not wholly unjustified. If you have any witnesses to the constant harassment,  have them write a statement, if your girlfriend saw anything, get a statement.

If you are union, have your rep present, do not just take this lying down.", "NTA - This is sexual harassment, and your boss and company need to take it seriously.

Your experiencing sexual harassment.  You did right letting your boss know.. if you're fired see a lawyer.  If not keep a notebook.  Log every time she does something that makes you uncomfortable", "NTA You should have reported her to HR the first time she made such a suggestion.  And telling her she should only talk to you if it is work related is correct.  That should be your rule with everyone else at your place of work.  She is going to tell one version of all this, and you are going to tell yours.  Who do you think they are going to be more inclined to believe?", "NTA. Should the meeting not be going well, do ask them how they would be reacting if the genders were reversed though. And remind them that you had brought this to their attention earlier but had received no support.", "NTA. You really fail to read into the situation though. You are not too harsh, you are too soft. This should've been reported to HR and documented so you can have a case when they try to make your life hell because you're the new guy.", "NTA. \n\nOP, is it possible for you to retain an attorney who specializes in sexual-harassment cases and bring him or her to this meeting?\n\nIf the firm sees you mean business, it might go much better for you. They don't want to be sued. Perhaps they'll arrange for you to leave with a good recommendation and a hefty piece of severance.\n\nOr they might fire the co-worker who is harassing you.\n\nI believe you have a crucial point in you favor in that you already complained to a supervisor who did nothing.", "NTA your manager has been sexually harassing you. You reported it to your boss, who ignored it and failed to act.

I understand you were frustrated, but you know that it was an inappropriate thing to say in a workplace. \nThat is why I'd mildly go ESH on this. She is definitely a far far bigger asshole than you. No means no. Period. Your boss seems like AH too, telling you that you shouldn' t think too much about it. That was highly inappropriate.

What I have said before is, Hey blanka or whatever her name is, I respect that you are married and I do not want to cause problems in your marriage or at work. Please, if you respect me as an individual you will stop. This usually gets them to stop but they will then talk shit. Like OP couldn't handle a real woman. and as long as you can ignore that, you should be fine.", "NTA. But you may have screwed yourself with the language you chose. On the plus side, you did tell your manger who handled this extremely inappropriately. Before your meeting, make a timeline as best you can recall of all the incidents and that you had already set boundaries that your senior coworker walked right over.

Bigger problem is that if you WERE to do anything with her and then things ended, she could very easily go to HR and claim you sexually harassed or assaulted her (basically that it was YOU who was the aggressor, not her). There are plenty of women who will play that manipulation game to get back at a guy by throwing some kind of sexual offense out there, in a way to say 'you rejected me, I'll show you'. Saw it happen a few times at the company I worked at for 20+ years. I made sure to never get involved with a female coworker, etc, as I had seen other females in the company who I knew were interested in a guy who got rejected and in turn went to HR about that guy they had the hots for, only to tell HR that she was subjected to sexual harassment.
