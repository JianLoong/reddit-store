My best friend and I were talking normally one day with me telling her I am finally moving out into my own place and that I can finally come get my cat which she had been taking care of for me for three years because it really didn\u2019t get along with my mom\u2019s cat and we couldn\u2019t keep both, so she offered to take care of it until I got my own place. Well, the day I called and told her \u00abI am moving out next week\u00bb everything was normal and she was really exited and happy for me, until we hung up. Then it was radio silence. She ignored every message and every call. This was 9 months ago and I still can\u2019t reach her. Her mom refused to tell me anything other than that she is okay. \n\nIf she wants me out of her life I can respect that, IF she give me her reason as to why. If it really is all about the cat and she didn\u2019t want to give it back of course she could keep him if she only asked me! She has probably bonded with him for years, while I have only paid for him and his bills while he was living with her, and only seen him while at her place. \n\nBut then again, it might not even have anything to do with the cat at all. I just need closure. I need to know why because I keep having dreams about her, I miss her SO much and don\u2019t know what happened. I am also so mad at her for abandoning me for no reason. In July I had lung surgery which could have killed me. Everything went fine and my lungs are finally healing and I am back to normal after a month in the hospital and alot of rest. I was terrified and so alone, and I needed her, but she never came, never even asked how I was doing. Her mom did tho, which is how I know my best friend knew, she just didn\u2019t care enough to even text me. \n\nSo, to the question. WIBTA if I showed up at her work as a customer to confront her? She works retail and she couldn\u2019t run away or ignore me that way. But I also feel like it is a huge violation of her privacy, I am just desperate and out of ideas. I do not want to make a scene or make it awkward, I just want to see her, and discreetly talk with her in private\n\nEDIT: I did text both her and her mom and told them that I am not looking to get the cat back if she grew attached and wants to keep him. It would be cruel of me to rip him away from her as he probably loves her too. I love him, and taking him from her would do him more harm than good. But I never got a reply from either of them. I only want the reason as to why she out of nowhere decided to cut contact.

Your feelings are understandable, and going to her home, just once, to knock on the door, during the afternoon or evening or whatever hours she's normally there and awake, would make perfect sense. Do not not not go to her job. Don't air your grievances in front of her coworkers. Don't make her job awkward for her. If you do that, it's just about revenge and making a scene. You might even get her fired. Be better than that.", "Woah nelly, yes YWBTA. \n\nShe has made it very clear she does not want contact. \n\nIt's hurtful and sad and she should have told you and all of that but you need to understand that you are not entitled to that if she chose not to. \n\nYou don't get to go stalking and confronting people in their workplace because they didn't give you an explanation about leaving your life. \n\nYou never have any right to *force* someone to give you closure.

The best I think you can do is talk to a therapist to figure out how to move on.", "YWBTA.\n\nBeing ghosted isn't fun, but it doesn't mean that we're owed an explanation or give us any right to harass people.

And regardless if she grew close to the cat it's your cat and you've been paying for it. So imo she agreed to do something for you with the terms that the cat would go back to you. Makes her just shutting you off wrong if that is really the reason. If she wants the cat to be hers she should be paying for all it's stuff. \n\nHave you asked her mom if she knows why and told u just need to understand? Maybe her mom can persuade her.", "ESH\n\nYWBTA for showing up at her work as a \"fake\" customer to confront her.\nShe is TA for cutting communications. Her mom btw is also TA for not telling what is up. If she does not want to be your friend anymore she should just tell you herself or tell you via her mom. \nYou also MIGHT be a small AH if you implied to take away the cat without telling her she could keep it. This might have triggered this whole story,  even though its still mostly her fault for just ghosting you.\n\nThe whole Situation sucks but two wrongs dont make a right if you understand what i mean. She could lose her job if you confront her at work and the Situation escalates", "If I tried going directly to her house she would just continue to ignore me and not even let me in.

(at that age? i'd potentially have a panic attack if a friend i'd deliberately gone NC with showed up at my job to demand a confrontation that i very clearly did not want to have).\n\nyour friend has chosen to go no contact with you. you are not entitled barge into her life or disrespect her boundaries to demand closure for your own satisfaction. you are not entitled to closure, period. it sucks but that is how it is, and further attempts to demand contact for the sake of closure will likely only end up hurting you both.", "YWBTA - Sometimes you need to just let it go.", "YWBTA\n\nConfronting her at work would put her in a terrible position. If she doesn't wanna talk, that's your closure.\n\nAnd let's be real. Three years. You abandoned the cat.", "YWBTA.\nTurning up at someone\u2019s work is stalker territory - please don\u2019t do this! It would also only make things much worse as she\u2019d feel humiliated and angry. \n\nGhosting is about someone wanting to avoid confrontation so forcing a confrontation is a very bad strategy.\n\nHave you considered writing her a letter? You could put down how much you miss her and say you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done wrong but you\u2019re sorry if you\u2019ve done anything that upset her - plus if it\u2019s about the cat then you\u2019re fine for her to keep it?", "YWBTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t show up to her work. Closure isn\u2019t something you always get from other people. Yeah, sometimes it would be nice to know why relationships end and what happened but you can\u2019t always know. And sometimes you have to make peace with not knowing. Focus on your life, developing new friend groups and new hobbies.", "YWBTA if you show up at her place of work. That would be harassing behaviour. \n\nN T A otherwise- I'm glad you recognise that the cat staying with her is likely better for the cat. Three years is a long time. Why not write her a letter? Presumably you know her address.", "This is clearly about the cat.\n\nThere are a lot of people who choose avoidance rather than having a hard conversation, because in their mind it *may* turn into a conflict. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, it just is.\n\nImagine this\u2014 she ghosted you over the cat to avoid a potential conflict. Now you\u2019ve texted saying it\u2019s find if she keeps the cat. Everything should be cool, right? Nope. Because now she would need to admit it was about the cat and explain why she ghosted rather than just tell you = potential conflict, again. OP, this friendship is over. It\u2019s sad that your friend feels so conflict adverse even over such a small issue.\n\nYTA if you confront her at work, but you are N T A in the situation in the general situation.", "ESH\n\nShe decided to ghost you immediately after you mentioned that you were moving house, despite STILL HAVING YOUR FUCKING CAT. As per your agreement, that cat is no longer hers. She straight-up ghosted you, and made it impossible for you to get your cat back. That's incredibly fucked up. I don't know or care why she ghosted you, but that's not ok. She should at least have made arrangements for the cat, and cleared that shit up with you first.\n\nNow, let's ignore the cat for a moment. Right now, you're considering showing up and publicly embarrassing her at work by asking her why she ghosted you. You're not asking about the cat anymore. It's not ABOUT the cat. This is about you getting a response from someone who does not want to contact you. That's technically harrassment.\n\nPersonally, I think it's perfectly fair, and I support it. But it would indeed make you an asshole.", "I think there is a little bit of ESH regarding the cat. One the one hand, when you have 'your cat' stay at someone else's house for 3 years, it definitely becomes their cat. On the other hand, while keeping the cat is reasonable, you shouldn't keep letting the original owner keep paying its bills when you have no intention of giving it back. OP shouldn't have approached the topic of taking the cat back so casually- if she had just said something along the lines of\n 'I am in a position to take the cat back now, but understand that you have probably bonded with it so am happy for you to keep it. However this would be on the understanding that it is now formally yours  and no longer my financial respnsibility'", "I am not going to take back the cat if she want to keep him, that would be cruel as he probably loves her too, I just want to know why she ghosted me", "Stop right now. It's probably about the cat. Don't go to her work. Cornering and confronting her at work is the worst idea ever. Take the hint and leave her alone. If she wanted to talk to you, she would. \n\nIt's really all about you. Your apartment, your surgery, your cat that you basically abandoned for 3 years, your need for an explanation. You sound exhausting", "Maybe in reality she owes you money if she knew she was never going to give back the cat... Vet bills aren't cheap. So it's really like she used you this whole time and cut you off when the end of the agreement came.", "But OP said if the friend asked to keep the cat, OP would just agreed. So the first thing you said is not true. \nYeah, I agree that showing at friend's work would make her TA, but at the moment the only A'hole is the friend.", "Her mom lives 6 hours away, but she suggested to \u00abarrange a meeting\u00bb with the three of us while she was visiting once in september, but I never heard anymore about it, so I guess my friend declined", "Have you told her you\u2019re ok with it if she wants to keep the cat?", "So it's ok this friend was taking her money to take care of the cat this whole time but then just ghosts her when she's about to move? They had an agreement and friend was happy to accept ops money this whole time because that was part their agreement for the friend to take care of the cat. I don't see how she can just go back on that when it suits her. \n\nJust because the post didn't include things the friend has been through with op doesn't mean doesn't mean op wasn't there for her friends problems. But I feel like there's missing info.", "I have been thinking the same thing, I have paid a huge amount of money for his vet bills, but I don\u2019t expect her to pay me back as in my mind he was still my cat. I still don\u2019t want the money back", "Op asked would I be the asshole so I said yes, so you're wrong op didn't ask if she's an asshole and then in my next bit said her friend is an asshole for not talking to her", "How about a phone call with her to explain how you're feeling? \n\nBtw: this is definitely about the cat.", "I texted both her and her mom saying if it is about the cat, I would absolutely let her keep him as he is really happy with her, but I never got a reply from either of them", "The friend had the cat for 3 YEARS. It's safe to say that this arrangement was the status quo and the friend likely didn't give much thought about OP ever taking it back. \n\nThe friend is wrong to ghost OP and she is an AH. It was probably out of shock and fear that she would lose the cat. But the question was WIBTA if she goes to the friends work. And I say yes, YWBTAH. I am not address the friend because that wasn't the question.", "Don't get me wrong, I'm talking about the cat part...", "Phonecalls are difficult with only one party participating...", "When I was younger, like your age-ish, I used to ghost people. It really didn\u2019t have much to do with them. It would be something small I was scared to talk about, but to me it would seem huge (like if I had someone\u2019s cat and didn\u2019t want to return it, that would feel huge to me) and then once it went on too long, I\u2019d be too embarrassed about having not responded to ever respond. I lost some very good friendships that way. Now that I\u2019m older I\u2019m not as terrified of confrontation or speaking my mind. But it might just be that she wanted the cat, was scared to tell you, and even after you addressed that part, she\u2019s scared you\u2019re mad about not having been there for you when you were sick, about going radio silent, about keeping your cat. She might just be scared. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s right at all. I wish I\u2019d had the guts in my youth to just tell my friends what I was thinking. Actually my dad does it too. Once he loses touch with someone he\u2019s so embarrassed, and thinks they probably would be mad if he reached out so belatedly, so he just punishes himself by ending the relationship.", "Obviously they don\u2019t believe you. To be honest from your title and then your comments, you seem to do a lot of insincere double talking. \n\nThey probably think you are going to try yo talk your way into taking the cat, or guilt them into giving it back.\n\nLeave them alone, and wait for your ex-friend to reach out to you.", "I didn't see you put any ah tbh. And I'm responding to the part after you saying it's about the cat. You called this person exhausting. I'll be honest, I would be at their door wanting my money back or my cat. Just for the mere fact she ghosted me. And to me, it's not abnormal to want your friend around during hard or scary moments.", "If the friend thought she'd keep the cat, then she should have started paying it for herself instead of keeping OPs money.", "I think you are absolutely right, she is scared and embarassed which is why I need her to know I am okay with it, of course she could keep the cat. I was mad at her for ghosting me, but now I am only hurt. I miss her more than anything and I need her to know that", "When was the last time you saw the cat?  Do you know it\u2019s still alive?", "Have proof that it is your cat, then have the cat taken, if you think it is worth it.\n\nBut do not show up at her work", "Ywbta\n\nYou want closure. She doesn\u2019t owe you closure. Don\u2019t show up at her work. That is a huge ah move", "YWBTA. \n\nSend a letter/email stating: you miss her and your friendship is the only thing you care about. You are fully okay with her keeping the cat and don\u2019t expect any money for the vet bills or anything like that. \n\nThen the ball\u2019s in her court. Don\u2019t approach, etc.", "YWBTA - only time I would deem it acceptable to confront someone at work is if you need to present them with legal papers and you've exhausted all options to do it elsewhere. Even then, I'd say catch them as they leave if possible. \n\nClosest I would go with this is to write a letter and post it through her door/letterbox. She may read it, she may not. People aren't obliged to interact with you socially (even if it hurts), and if she chooses not to, them's the breaks. \n\nYour closure is to assume it's the cat imo. Sometimes we just have to end-cap things ourselves. If you're having trouble feel free to talk to a therapist to work your way through your feelings. It's understandable to be upset and grieving for a lost friend, but at the end of the day trying to stalk your friend will just make things worse for the both of you.", "Also make clear that you aren't looking to move in with the friend. Maybe she thought you were looking for someone to house you after moving out of your place.  Wait, this is a real in-person friend, not an internet friend, right? And your positive she still has the cat?", "YWBTA  - grow up- you don\u2019t show up at peoples jobs to create drama", "She owes you either the vet bill money or your cat back. Can't be both.", "Showing up at her house would be better than the workplace.", "I agree with this, sadly it doesn't look like OP will get closure here, which is a shame as from what they've written they haven't, other than insinuating that they'll likely want their cat back soon done anything really wrong, and I am reckoning Best Friend freaked out and has gone to ground in fear of the cat being retrieved from them unwillingly (even if OP didn't say they would)", "She didn't abandon.  She kept paying.  This is proof enough that its hers legally.", "I think the line in the middle \"I need to know why I can't stop dreaming about friend\" might be a hint that there is way more context here.\n\nI agree about the bills in general, but would ask \"when was the last bill paid?\"", "Oof. I agree with the others that YWBTA if you confronted her at work, but otherwise I think you've got a good mindset about this, and I feel bad for you that she let you keep paying for the cat's bills this whole time. Oh well. I'm sorry this happened, but in any case if you're letting her keep the cat, at least the bills are her responsibility now..."]}
