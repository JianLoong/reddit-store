My best friend and I were talking normally one day with me telling her I am finally moving out into my own place and that I can finally come get my cat which she had been taking care of for me for three years because it really didn\u2019t get along with my mom\u2019s cat and we couldn\u2019t keep both, so she offered to take care of it until I got my own place. Well, the day I called and told her \u00abI am moving out next week\u00bb everything was normal and she was really exited and happy for me, until we hung up. Then it was radio silence. She ignored every message and every call. This was 9 months ago and I still can\u2019t reach her. Her mom refused to tell me anything other than that she is okay. \n\nIf she wants me out of her life I can respect that, IF she give me her reason as to why. If it really is all about the cat and she didn\u2019t want to give it back of course she could keep him if she only asked me! She has probably bonded with him for years, while I have only paid for him and his bills while he was living with her, and only seen him while at her place. \n\nBut then again, it might not even have anything to do with the cat at all. I just need closure. I need to know why because I keep having dreams about her, I miss her SO much and don\u2019t know what happened. I am also so mad at her for abandoning me for no reason. In July I had lung surgery which could have killed me. Everything went fine and my lungs are finally healing and I am back to normal after a month in the hospital and alot of rest. I was terrified and so alone, and I needed her, but she never came, never even asked how I was doing. Her mom did tho, which is how I know my best friend knew, she just didn\u2019t care enough to even text me. \n\nSo, to the question. WIBTA if I showed up at her work as a customer to confront her? She works retail and she couldn\u2019t run away or ignore me that way. But I also feel like it is a huge violation of her privacy, I am just desperate and out of ideas. I do not want to make a scene or make it awkward, I just want to see her, and discreetly talk with her in private\n\nEDIT: I did text both her and her mom and told them that I am not looking to get the cat back if she grew attached and wants to keep him. It would be cruel of me to rip him away from her as he probably loves her too. I love him, and taking him from her would do him more harm than good. But I never got a reply from either of them. I only want the reason as to why she out of nowhere decided to cut contact.

(at that age? i'd potentially have a panic attack if a friend i'd deliberately gone NC with showed up at my job to demand a confrontation that i very clearly did not want to have).\n\nyour friend has chosen to go no contact with you. you are not entitled barge into her life or disrespect her boundaries to demand closure for your own satisfaction. you are not entitled to closure, period. it sucks but that is how it is, and further attempts to demand contact for the sake of closure will likely only end up hurting you both.", "YWBTA - Sometimes you need to just let it go.", "YWBTA\n\nConfronting her at work would put her in a terrible position.

You abandoned the cat.", "YWBTA.\nTurning up at someone\u2019s work is stalker territory - please don\u2019t do this!

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, it just is.\n\nImagine this\u2014 she ghosted you over the cat to avoid a potential conflict. Now you\u2019ve texted saying it\u2019s find if she keeps the cat. Everything should be cool, right? Nope. Because now she would need to admit it was about the cat and explain why she ghosted rather than just tell you = potential conflict, again. OP, this friendship is over. It\u2019s sad that your friend feels so conflict adverse even over such a small issue.\n\nYTA if you confront her at work, but you are N T A in the situation in the general situation.", "ESH\n\nShe decided to ghost you immediately after you mentioned that you were moving house, despite STILL HAVING YOUR FUCKING CAT. As per your agreement, that cat is no longer hers. She straight-up ghosted you, and made it impossible for you to get your cat back. That's incredibly fucked up. I don't know or care why she ghosted you, but that's not ok. She should at least have made arrangements for the cat, and cleared that shit up with you first.\n\nNow, let's ignore the cat for a moment. Right now, you're considering showing up and publicly embarrassing her at work by asking her why she ghosted you. You're not asking about the cat anymore. It's not ABOUT the cat. This is about you getting a response from someone who does not want to contact you. That's technically harrassment.\n\nPersonally, I think it's perfectly fair, and I support it. But it would indeed make you an asshole.", "I think there is a little bit of ESH regarding the cat. One the one hand, when you have 'your cat' stay at someone else's house for 3 years, it definitely becomes their cat. On the other hand, while keeping the cat is reasonable, you shouldn't keep letting the original owner keep paying its bills when you have no intention of giving it back. OP shouldn't have approached the topic of taking the cat back so casually- if she had just said something along the lines of\n 'I am in a position to take the cat back now, but understand that you have probably bonded with it so am happy for you to keep it. However this would be on the understanding that it is now formally yours  and no longer my financial respnsibility'", "I am not going to take back the cat if she want to keep him, that would be cruel as he probably loves her too, I just want to know why she ghosted me", "Stop right now. It's probably about the cat. Don't go to her work. Cornering and confronting her at work is the worst idea ever. Take the hint and leave her alone. If she wanted to talk to you, she would. \n\nIt's really all about you. Your apartment, your surgery, your cat that you basically abandoned for 3 years, your need for an explanation. You sound exhausting", "Maybe in reality she owes you money if she knew she was never going to give back the cat... Vet bills aren't cheap. So it's really like she used you this whole time and cut you off when the end of the agreement came.", "But OP said if the friend asked to keep the cat, OP would just agreed. So the first thing you said is not true. \nYeah, I agree that showing at friend's work would make her TA, but at the moment the only A'hole is the friend.", "Her mom lives 6 hours away, but she suggested to \u00abarrange a meeting\u00bb with the three of us while she was visiting once in september, but I never heard anymore about it, so I guess my friend declined", "Have you told her you\u2019re ok with it if she wants to keep the cat?", "So it's ok this friend was taking her money to take care of the cat this whole time but then just ghosts her when she's about to move? They had an agreement and friend was happy to accept ops money this whole time because that was part their agreement for the friend to take care of the cat. I don't see how she can just go back on that when it suits her. \n\nJust because the post didn't include things the friend has been through with op doesn't mean doesn't mean op wasn't there for her friends problems. But I feel like there's missing info.", "I have been thinking the same thing, I have paid a huge amount of money for his vet bills, but I don\u2019t expect her to pay me back as in my mind he was still my cat. I still don\u2019t want the money back", "Op asked would I be the asshole so I said yes, so you're wrong op didn't ask if she's an asshole and then in my next bit said her friend is an asshole for not talking to her", "How about a phone call with her to explain how you're feeling? \n\nBtw: this is definitely about the cat.", "I texted both her and her mom saying if it is about the cat, I would absolutely let her keep him as he is really happy with her, but I never got a reply from either of them", "The friend had the cat for 3 YEARS. It's safe to say that this arrangement was the status quo and the friend likely didn't give much thought about OP ever taking it back. \n\nThe friend is wrong to ghost OP and she is an AH. It was probably out of shock and fear that she would lose the cat. But the question was WIBTA if she goes to the friends work. And I say yes, YWBTAH. I am not address the friend because that wasn't the question.", "Don't get me wrong, I'm talking about the cat part...", "Phonecalls are difficult with only one party participating...", "When I was younger, like your age-ish, I used to ghost people. It really didn\u2019t have much to do with them. It would be something small I was scared to talk about, but to me it would seem huge (like if I had someone\u2019s cat and didn\u2019t want to return it, that would feel huge to me) and then once it went on too long, I\u2019d be too embarrassed about having not responded to ever respond. I lost some very good friendships that way. Now that I\u2019m older I\u2019m not as terrified of confrontation or speaking my mind. But it might just be that she wanted the cat, was scared to tell you, and even after you addressed that part, she\u2019s scared you\u2019re mad about not having been there for you when you were sick, about going radio silent, about keeping your cat. She might just be scared. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s right at all. I wish I\u2019d had the guts in my youth to just tell my friends what I was thinking. Actually my dad does it too. Once he loses touch with someone he\u2019s so embarrassed, and thinks they probably would be mad if he reached out so belatedly, so he just punishes himself by ending the relationship.", "Obviously they don\u2019t believe you. To be honest from your title and then your comments, you seem to do a lot of insincere double talking. \n\nThey probably think you are going to try yo talk your way into taking the cat, or guilt them into giving it back.\n\nLeave them alone, and wait for your ex-friend to reach out to you.", "I didn't see you put any ah tbh. And I'm responding to the part after you saying it's about the cat. You called this person exhausting. I'll be honest, I would be at their door wanting my money back or my cat. Just for the mere fact she ghosted me. And to me, it's not abnormal to want your friend around during hard or scary moments.", "If the friend thought she'd keep the cat, then she should have started paying it for herself instead of keeping OPs money.", "I think you are absolutely right, she is scared and embarassed which is why I need her to know I am okay with it, of course she could keep the cat. I was mad at her for ghosting me, but now I am only hurt. I miss her more than anything and I need her to know that", "When was the last time you saw the cat?  Do you know it\u2019s still alive?", "Have proof that it is your cat, then have the cat taken, if you think it is worth it.\n\nBut do not show up at her work", "Ywbta\n\nYou want closure. She doesn\u2019t owe you closure. Don\u2019t show up at her work. That is a huge ah move", "YWBTA. \n\nSend a letter/email stating: you miss her and your friendship is the only thing you care about. You are fully okay with her keeping the cat and don\u2019t expect any money for the vet bills or anything like that. \n\nThen the ball\u2019s in her court. Don\u2019t approach, etc.", "YWBTA - only time I would deem it acceptable to confront someone at work is if you need to present them with legal papers and you've exhausted all options to do it elsewhere. Even then, I'd say catch them as they leave if possible. \n\nClosest I would go with this is to write a letter and post it through her door/letterbox. She may read it, she may not. People aren't obliged to interact with you socially (even if it hurts), and if she chooses not to, them's the breaks. \n\nYour closure is to assume it's the cat imo. Sometimes we just have to end-cap things ourselves. If you're having trouble feel free to talk to a therapist to work your way through your feelings. It's understandable to be upset and grieving for a lost friend, but at the end of the day trying to stalk your friend will just make things worse for the both of you.", "Also make clear that you aren't looking to move in with the friend. Maybe she thought you were looking for someone to house you after moving out of your place.  Wait, this is a real in-person friend, not an internet friend, right? And your positive she still has the cat?", "YWBTA  - grow up- you don\u2019t show up at peoples jobs to create drama", "She owes you either the vet bill money or your cat back. Can't be both.", "Showing up at her house would be better than the workplace.", "I agree with this, sadly it doesn't look like OP will get closure here, which is a shame as from what they've written they haven't, other than insinuating that they'll likely want their cat back soon done anything really wrong, and I am reckoning Best Friend freaked out and has gone to ground in fear of the cat being retrieved from them unwillingly (even if OP didn't say they would)", "She didn't abandon.  She kept paying.  This is proof enough that its hers legally.", "I think the line in the middle \"I need to know why I can't stop dreaming about friend\" might be a hint that there is way more context here.\n\nI agree about the bills in general, but would ask \"when was the last bill paid?\"", "Oof. I agree with the others that YWBTA if you confronted her at work, but otherwise I think you've got a good mindset about this, and I feel bad for you that she let you keep paying for the cat's bills this whole time. Oh well. I'm sorry this happened, but in any case if you're letting her keep the cat, at least the bills are her responsibility now...", "As someone who was very unceremoniously dropped by my best friend of 10 years, I am just here to tell you that you may never get the closure you need. I was the first of my friends to have a kid (I was also not young, 30 when I had him). My best friend wanted to be there for me, and she definitely was off and on (which I understand, because it is hard to be with a newborn/toddler when you don't have kids). When she got pregnant, I was SO EXCITED! She had her first kid way too early at 25 weeks, and I sat in the hospital with her and her husband for days, got her a full wardrobe of premie clothes, and stocked their fridge with all kinds of ready made meals cooked by me. We were so close. Then she got pregnant again and everything went to hell. I was again so excited for her, but she just started to shut me out. The last time I saw her was at her oldest kid's 4th birthday (5ish years ago). We all had fun, spent the day letting the kids play and talking about all of the amazing things we have done together. And then I didn't hear from her for 2 years. She reached out then to see if I could make something for her, since I am a pretty well known crafter in our area, and when I said yes, she totally ghosted. I did everything short of stalking her to see what I did wrong. She wouldn't respond to text, FB, phone calls.... Nothing. I thought she may have died. It was so traumatic. I finally called her husband one day and just asked him if she was alive, and he was SHOCKED that she had been avoiding me. I guess she just kept telling him a was busy every time he would ask why I wasn't around more. She completely cut out our entire friend group from college slowly and without any kind of warning. And the thing with all of us is that we are supportive, successful people that literally never did anything but be there for her through everything. I have never found out why she did what she did, but 5 years later, we are at a point that I'm not sure she would say hi if she saw me in public. You YWBTA if you go to her work to get closure. Unfortunately, we don't always get that in life. I suggest you mourne the loss of your friend and try to move on with your life. As my parents told me during all of this, you should never have to convince someone to be your friend and your relationship will never be the same again.", "NTA as long as you don't make a scene. You've been paying for their care-if you are in the US, you have not legally abandoned the cat. She's ghosting you and being a sh\\*\\* friend for not even discussing this with you. Nothing happened to the cat, right? You think they are still alive and happy? I would personally get my cat back because I don't trust people who apparently cannot handle being adult enough to have this conversation especially if they claimed to be/have been my friend.\n\nI've been the  person watching the pet and the person ghosted, didn't pay, etc, and showed up 12mo+ later. Legally, they became mine after 3mo of abandonment and I had already paid for extensive vet bills. I did get legal consult involved because the other person was unstable and it was likely the neglect would have resulted in the pet's death.  That is not what happened here though. You paid, you trusted them, they ghosted you and are keeping your animal. Would you tolerate this out of any other pet sitter? I wouldn't expect any updates or visits going forward if you allow this situation to stand.", "YWBTA just accept the friendship is over and you may never know why. Don't turn up and make a scene at her place of work", "YWBTA if you did this. As far as needing closure, you do that for yourself. Nobody can do it for you. It may be easier if you found out why. Then again, it may make it harder. In the end, it's you who has the power to accept that it is what it is and move on.", "YTA.\n\n> If she wants me out of her life I can respect that, IF she give me her reason as to why. \n\nNo.  If she wants you out of her life, she doesn't need your permission.\n\n>  I just need closure.\n\nHere's your closure: \"I'm the sort of person that can't take a hint.

I'm the sort of person who thinks that my wants far and away trump other people's needs.  I am toxic, and I drive people away with my clingy attitude, my lack of concern for them, and my main character syndrome, expressed as 'I need closure, and it's your responsibility to give it to me, and unless I am completely satisfied, you do not have the right to not be in a relationship with me, a relationship that I alone get to set the terms of.'\n\nYou need to talk to a professional to sort out some of your toxic attitudes.", "Yta\n\nYou gave a cat away for 3 years, now want it back?\n\nTough shit luv. Not only would I think you were brazen, I'd also think you were cruel for uprooting the cat for the 4th time.\n\nEither that or the cat died and she didn't tell you", "YWBTA - confronting them at work is not cool and no matter what they've done they deserve a personal/professional boundary. It's a super tricky situation, but if you've tried visiting them at home or trying to run into them in public when they aren't at work with no luck then you might just need to draw a line under it. Or maybe try talking to mutual friends to see what's up?", "Ywbta.  And younhave closure. She ghostd you. Learn, live and move on.", "Agreed if OP confronts friend while working. YTA for confronting friend in workplace.\n\nI would find out what time the friend finishes work and then confront her.\n\nGhosting people is passive-aggressive and down right rude.\n\nIf this friend wants to keep the cat fine. \nHowever OP has been paying for all the bills for the cat this whole time. At this point the friend has been dishonest and not discussing the financial arrangement for the cat.\n\nGhosting people as a way to avoid conflict or communication seems to be acceptable for some people. It is not acceptable or okay. It's a control tactic.\n\nI think this friend has taken advantage of OP for money and they know it.\nI would not confront friend at all. Instead\nI would sue the friend in small claims court for the money she paid for the cat to be taken care of amd move on. \n\nThis \"friend\" can't be trusted and if they consider \"Ghosting\" an okay form of behavior they can't be trusted not to do it again.\n \nIn OP case they paid for all the cat needs and bills while the cat was in friends care. That is not an owner who abandoned their pet.", "Ok, then she can reimburse her for the cat care.  Op paid the bills for the cat.  I understand it's 3 years, but if gf accepted the money for the care, then she was watching the cat for her.", "My experience with people wanting closure.( In close long term relationships not talking about texting somebody for a few weeks and then getting ghosted)\n\n1  the ghoster is an asshole who has convincingly hid their feelings , often lied and just doesn't want to be an adult an have any amount of uncomfortable conversation.  Plus there may be the added , they don't want to actually end the friendship because they might want something some day.\n\n2 the person ghosted did not listen for a very long time.  Things like \" this is too much for me\" , it's really hard for me when you do x\"  , \"if you do x I never want to speak to you again \"are ignored.  \n\n3 ghoster pulls back a little bit, sometimes giving a reason sometimes not.  Then ghosted losses it and quadruples  the amount of times they reach out to ghoster, the contact becomes demanding and hysteric. Eg I need to study for finals I'm not going to be as available for a few weeks.   Texts 59 times, then starts \"why don't you like me anymore?!??\" Then just keeps escalating.\n\n4 they really were not as close as ghosted thought.  \n\n5 there was frequent conflict.  \n\n6 ghostee was a shitty friend and ghoster just got sick of it.  Eg asks for dozens of favors and never offers help back, always late/cancels at the last second, doesn't return kindness or appreciation etc. Or my gf left idk why, I mean sure I drink daily , puke on the carpet, piss on the couch, can't hold a job but she never said this was an issue what gives. Or ghoster thinks ghosted was a shitty friend eg ghosted didn't call for a few weeks when they had COVID.", "Agreed. Like having someone else watch your cat for 3 years is a bit wack but Idk what the friend expected...like did she think OP would just keep paying its bills indefinitely? I guess an important distinction to make is whether OP has been paying for food and litter the whole time. Paying vets bills for a cat you both care about is one thing but if OP has been paying for food and litter the whole time her friend is completely in the wrong.", "It sounds like her mom is open to helping you guys reconcile. Maybe you could send her a to-the-point text or email where you explicitly say that:\n\n1. If the ghosting is about the cat, you categorically do not want it back and do not expect any money for it. Make clear how you don't want to lose the friendship over an accidental miscommunication.\n2. If it's not about the cat then it would be nice to have an explanation but if that's not possible, you'll respect it and not bother her anymore. \n\nI know option 2 would be hard but I guess at least you'll know it's not about something as simple as crossed wires about a pet. \n\nHonestly if they don't respond to that I think it would be really poor form. I do get slightly weird vibes from the fact that your friend's mum is mediating this conflict, and ghosting you to begin with is such a shit thing to do that I wouldn't expect much from them.", "OP lost her best friend without warning or reason- if that happened to me I would find it traumatic enough to dream about it. Some friend break ups can be worse than relationship break ups! Especially at 22 when friends are way more constant than romantic partners and can seem more important than family. I really don't think it's weird to be dreaming about an important person you've lost.\n\nAs for the bills, OP describes paying for the cat and his bills as if it's current. And she describes his vets bills as huge. So it does sound like she's at least owed an explanation.", "To be fair I often find if I am dreaming and or thinking about someone a lot it pretty much 99 times out of 100 that there is something going on with them. Maybe OP has that ability? Or maybe there's something else going on? Who knows!", "I don't think the dream is the weird part...I do think \"they haven't spoken to me in 9 months, I NEED to find out why I'm ....\" Is the , and what does that mean?  Trigger.  Op is asking \"can I go to their job so they have to talk to me\" .  Are we at I tried to contact them 10 times in a week or 10,000 times in 9 months?  Because op will accept friend who is ignored them fairly pointedly for 9 months once I'm out of their life but only if the friend tells them why first .  The friends mom won't answer questions besides \"friend is fine\"", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this but overall NTA. it would be an AH move to confront someone at their place of work but what do all the Y T A voters expect you to do? Yeah, she had been watching the cat for three years and probably grew attached but that\u2019s your cat that she knew she was watching for a limited amount of time. It doesn\u2019t seem like you ever told her she could keep him either. She stole your cat and is getting away with it. She\u2019s TA. It\u2019s very nice of you to be willing to let her keep the cat because he has bonded with her but I would be doing a hell of a lot more than just show up at her work if someone stole my pet and ghosted me.", "At this point she's not your best friend, she's a craven asshole and her mother should be ashamed. Please move on. YWBTA\n\nP.S. stop giving them money for the cat. Something sounds off there.", "YWBTA. I know it's hard not having closure, but showing up at her work to harass her isn't going to fix anything. It's more likely to get her in trouble at work, get you banned from there, and destroy any possibility of repairing the relationship or actually getting closure.", "YWBTA.  Nobody owes anyone an explanation for cutting them out of their lives.  For the one getting cut out, it'd would be nice to get some closure or a greater understanding.  But for the one doing the cutting, it is sometimes the best option for them. \n\nI don't know why she's gone NC, and although they say it's not, it could very well be the cat.  You already indicated that you were interested in getting the cat back, so she may now believe that you'll lie about your intentions to get access to the cat, and then steal it.  Has she experienced anything like that in her past that might make her less trusting of others?  Have you gone back on your word on other things, maybe even seemingly meaningless things, in the past?  The reason may lie in the answers to those questions.  Or it might not.  But, at the end of the day, she appears to have made her decision regarding your role in her life and absolutely doesn't owe you an explanation.  \n\nFWIW, I am sorry you're going through this.", "Maybe call up the closeby vets and ask if they can confirm if the cat is still alive. Go in person maybe to seem less sketch... that's all I got as far as possible insight into her sudden disinterest in getting back to you. It would be awkward to find out you weren't really paying for vet visits.", "Yes you would be the AH.  It's one thing to show up at her place to confront her, but not at her work.  The conversation you need to have should not take place at someones place of business.  Very uncool.  You run the risk of getting her in trouble.", "NTA and I am sorry this happened to you however no communication is communication. Your friend the AH has refused to speak to you for 9 months.\n\nThats an answer. Let it go and try to make new friends", "YWBTA to go to her work. The cat is gone. It's the only thing that makes sense. The friendship is obviously over. I'd get a lawyer and a police escort to at least validate the kitty is OK.", "Stop telling people this is okay. I had someone who was very much freaking me out and I removed them from everything and their thought was to hang around for over an hour outside my house to try and apologize. It\u2019s not normal! She hasn\u2019t spoke to you in 9 months. Don\u2019t show up to her house. She doesn\u2019t want to see you!", "It would certainly explain things if this were the issue. If the cat unexpectedly died and the friend didn\u2019t know how to tell OP, and then more and more time passed and it became worse and worse that she hadn\u2019t already told her\u2026 I can imagine someone panicking and ghosting over that. Seriously messed up, but would explain it.", "The last time I saw him was when I visited them about a year ago, he was happy and healthy. He was also alive when we last talked on the phone 9 months ago, but alot could have happened in that time. I don\u2019t think she would keep it from me, she knows how much I love that cat, and that I would rather know if something had happened", "You don\u2019t get to accept money to take care of someone\u2019s pet and then go nc when they get it back friends an asshole and if she looses her job maybe she should have just talked to op instead of ghosting"]}
