I told her to calm down or leave, to which she responded, \u201cYou\u2019re an f-ing asshole and have no idea what it\u2019s like to take care of another person.\u201d She stormed out before I could say anything.\n\nI just wonder if I owe her an apology here or not.", "created_utc": 1691842586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p344z/aita_for_telling_a_woman_off_for_bringing_her/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had options, you could have told your boss you wanted additional pay for cleaning up the mess, refused to clean the mess, requested a different shift. What you can't do - if you wish to remain employed - is expose your boss to legal liability. \n\nThe person you owe an apology to is the owner of the business at risk of legal action because you deliberately and publicly undertook an action you had been specifically instructed not to because of the legal consequences.", "NTA why not let old grandpa pee in the shower then hose it down.", "NTA.

Shocking how you talked to a stranger and an elder like that. It would have been proper to approach her gently when her grandad is in the loo. You could explain the mess he leaves and suggest that she ask him to sit down. Then when he comes out you'd go into the bathroom together and show her the mess.

And then she was shameless enough to come back again after she had already been yelled at? Seems reasonable? She and her Mississippi pissing grandpappy shoulda got banned at best", "Absolutely NTA. Being a retail worker shouldn't mean cleaning up piss daily. Daughter being the carer would know her father leaves a mess as her do it at home, if she cleaned up after no worries, but she knowingly brings him there where he leaves a mess for someone else to clean up", "But that\u2019s not true. A lot businesses have policies the bathrooms are for paying customers that is what owner should do.

That woman is *intentionally* making a disgusting mess there for to OP to clean up, day after day, she brings him there specifically to make it, and not even buying anything.  No, just no, she 100% deserved to be called out for deliberately, knowingly making OP clean human waste on a daily basis when she's not even a customer.

She could at least buy something!!", "Then as the owner you can clean up the bathroom after them multiple times a day.", "Yeah, she doesn\u2019t want to clean up when he pissed on the floor.", "They don't buy anything so OP is basically cleaning up piss for free because the owner doesn't want to take a stand and say the bathroom is for customers only. If I were your employee I would quit.", "Do you doubt that Gramps is going to piss all over the floor?", "Even if he has some medical issue, the fact that they come in multiple times every day and leave a huge mess just indicates the woman is aware of the mess and doesn\u2019t want to clean it in her own bathroom. That\u2019s exceptionally inconsiderate to those who work there.", "Yep, I don't know why that is not her solution, male urinal or have him sit to pee at home.

Just because someone works in a public store doesn\u2019t mean they should be subjected to regular unhygienic conditions cleaning someone excrements just because the caretaker doesn\u2019t want to deal with the mess. That\u2019s work place abuse. Also, to piss all over a bathroom and leave is a DISGUSTING move. Not that it\u2019s the old man\u2019s fault.

So they swing in. \n\nYou seem to think she's going out of her way to drag her dying father to a damn Bodega to use a public bathroom *just* to avoid a piss mess. You don't think she's dealing with the piss and shit at home? \n\nYou do not know their struggle, and assuming you do know, assuming they are coming in just to be disrespectful is main character syndrome. \n\nBuddy works at a glammed up Circle K.

They are using this bathroom for the SOLE purpose so that grandpa can piss where he wants and his caretaker relative doesn't have to clean it up.\n\nTHAT is a problem. NO ONE wants to go into a bathroom where the previous person has pissed or shat on the floor. \n\nEw man, making people make contact with your bodily fluids (or those of the person under your care) is GROSS!", "What did the granddaughter think would happen to the piss after they left?

I don't know if you're just refusing to believe it because it contradicts some belief of yours, but this is clearly the reason why they use that toilet.\n\nIf you still don't believe it, then you're welcome to explain why only the grandpa uses the toilet and why they go there multiple times a day without buying anything.", "Damn you\u2019d think you had to clean up that piss too! No she\u2019s the AH for how she handled it, that\u2019s my opinion!", "So when it comes to public bathrooms, it is the duty of the customer to clean them? Wild sentiment.

You're not wiping the sink. Or cleaning the mirrors. You're coming in, leaving a mess (size is absolutely irrelevant because you're not cleaning it anyway) and then leaving. \n\nThere's a bigger picture here, and you don't wanna recognize the other side to this story. You don't even seem to want to entertain the idea that daughter and father are humans living through their own shit show. You just wanna fuss and cry about some pee that wont survive the day on the floor. That's fine, some people don't know how to weigh both sides of a situation.

If it was done on a public bathroom with a janitor that's a different story, but it's done where OP is responsible and they have every right to be pissed about it.\n\nThe intentions aren't the problem. The end result of creating a disgusting job for OP daily is. Cleaning up a strangers piss isn't a non issue for the person having to do it either."]}
