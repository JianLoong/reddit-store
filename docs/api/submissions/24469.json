I got this job through a family friend and enjoy working here a lot.\n\nAs my hours went up in summer, I started to notice that a middle-aged woman would visit the shop with her grandfather multiple times a day.

When I asked what we should do instead, he shrugged and said there\u2019s nothing we could do about it.\n\nWell yesterday the woman came in when I was working, of course dragging her grandfather along. At a busy hour in front of a bunch of customers, I loudly said something along the lines of \u201cCan you stop using our bathroom because you don\u2019t want to clean up Grandpa\u2019s mess?

I figured I had handled the situation.\n\nLater she came back, though, and shrieked at me about how she\u2019s the only person her grandfather has and how she had to quit her job to take care of him. I told her to calm down or leave, to which she responded, \u201cYou\u2019re an f-ing asshole and have no idea what it\u2019s like to take care of another person.\u201d She stormed out before I could say anything.\n\nI just wonder if I owe her an apology here or not.", "created_utc": 1691842586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p344z/aita_for_telling_a_woman_off_for_bringing_her/", "score": 1675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had options, you could have told your boss you wanted additional pay for cleaning up the mess, refused to clean the mess, requested a different shift.

Shocking how you talked to a stranger and an elder like that. It would have been proper to approach her gently when her grandad is in the loo. You could explain the mess he leaves and suggest that she ask him to sit down. Then when he comes out you'd go into the bathroom together and show her the mess.

The fact that he paints the walls & floor with urine means that she is not providing him with proper \u201ctoileting assistance\u201d.  She\u2019s either standing outside the door while he does his business OR she\u2019s going in the bathroom with him so it looks like she\u2019s providing him with the proper \u201ctoileting assistance\u201d but then just abandons him to spray the walls & floor by himself.  Either results in him creating an unsafe & unhygienic environment for others & himself due to her action/inaction.  \n\nAdditionally, since he has to turn away from the urinal to walk away, the urine on the floor poses a significant danger to him in particular since he is elderly.  Falls can be deadly for the elderly.  And falls usually happen when an elderly person is turning or begins to walk.  So his own piss running rivers on the floor (combined with the fact that he has to turn & walk in it) literally creates a life-threatening danger to him.  \n\nThat\u2019s neglect & physical abuse - whether he was legitimately just walking  by or brought there from his home.
