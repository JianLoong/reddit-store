When people said it didn\u2019t look good I tried explaining to her that she needed to find something that would suit her face and not mine. \n\nI also have a big fear of insects ever since I was a child, (she always loved them) saturday night she came out of her room screaming because of a cicada and it was so unusual that even my mother told her \u201csince when are you afraid of insects?\u201d. \n\nWe both go to the gym, I lift more than her since I\u2019ve been going for longer and she tore a muscle because she just wanted to lift the same as me.\n\nI cut my hair really short a week ago, she\u2019s now talking about cutting her hair too (mind you, she would never let anyone cut it before because she wanted them really long before).\n\nI talked to my parents about dying my hair red, she said she wanted it red as well.\nI dress a certain way, she wants to dress the same way. \nI lose weight, she wants to lose weight. I eat something, she eats it as well.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to a point where everybody just notices it, the other day when we were out with friends she said that the Arctic Monkeys were her favorite band, my friends looked at her and asked \u201cWasn\u2019t it your sister\u2019s favorite band?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tried speaking to her calmly multiple times about how it bothers me that she acts the same exact way, but she always chooses to ignore me or give me some shitty excuse.\n\nToday I just snapped; I was talking to my friend about a series I really love and she butted in saying how it was her favorite show and she really loves that one specific character that is my favorite.

My parents are on her side, saying how it was rude and she\u2019s doing it because she looks up to me, but it\u2019s very invasive and as I said, I tried talking it over calmly multiple times.

I love her with all my heart and want her to be herself. She\u2019s a great person (apart from the copying) and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want a mini-me walking around.

She\u2019s old enough to know exactly what she is doing. \n\nIf you can\u2019t get anyone to take the issue seriously and talk some sense into her or get her therapy then you might just have to bide your time until you can move out and go low contact with her (and probably your parents too while she lives with them.) \n\nYou need to look into the grey rock method. Google it. It should help you defect her if she asks you questions and it should help you stop sharing information with her. \n\nShe is not going to stop so you need to stop the flow of information she gets. Meet friends at their houses, or outside, away from her. Block her from your social media and get your friends on board blocking her too. Basically don\u2019t give her anything to copy.\n\n\nYou share a home with her do she will still be able to copy what you look like but stop sharing anything else with her. \n\nIf your parents get on you for excluding her, Blame them. Say that you\u2019re really sad that you can\u2019t have a real sisterly relationship because she\u2019s not your sister she\u2019s your shadow. Or if that will cause problems then perhaps say that you are hoping that some distance will help her develop her own taste. Honestly you are probably going to have to grey rock your parents too if they keep on about it! \n\nBut you are not the asshole and it\u2019s not flattering it is disturbing. It\u2019s disappointing that your parents think so little if your sister that they are not concerned that she\u2019s a shadow of a person. Shame on them.", "NTA \n\nTypical teens, they'd probably grow out of it\nBut yeah, distance yourself from her a little bit\n\nI understand that she might be looking up to you, but that's too much.

Call their bluff and ask for family therapy.

Good luck, and at worst you can move out in a year and not talk to them", "Nta talk to your parents again, this seems unhealthy like she has very low self esteem.

Also, again, I could understand if it were a few things, but she\u2019s over doing it. I am 100% she tore a muscle because she wanted to copy me because she kept asking over and over how much I was lifting just to try and do the same.

You need to exercise and progressively increase the weight, you can\u2019t just go from lifting 30kg to 60kg all at once. There\u2019s no way I could help her, she just needs to take it slowly.

Only ask. Sounds like you have some main character syndrome going on.", "I'm a little sister too. NTA.\n\nI did this to my sister growing up especially when I was in middle school and she was going into high school. When I was younger it was genuinely because I did look up to her and wanted to be just like her, but by the time I was around 12 or 13, I started to develop my own sense of self that correlated more to my friends and interests. \n\nA while back, I had a friend start doing this to me and it DROVE ME NUTS, things like wanting to wear all the same clothes, changing her room to be like mine, and changing her hair to be like mine (this one really got to me because I have naturally curly hair and she has wavy hair and would get upset that hers wouldn't curl like mine and every time I wore it curly she would express her frustration) my sister and I actually had a good rant/laugh about it because suddenly I knew exactly how she felt.\n\nSorry, I am rambling, so I'll add something constructive: to stop getting so annoyed with my friend, I started looking for little individualities. If she showed interest in something uniquely hers, I would start strongly encouraging it, asking her all about it. That seemed to help a lot more with getting her to pursue her own interests. She may not stop but it's okay and normal to be annoyed by this. \n\nEdit: typos and condensing", "I have the right to tell her if what she is doing is clearly making me uncomfortable. She\u2019s overstepping my boundaries by doing some crazy stuff. As I said, I\u2019d be fine if it was basic stuff. There\u2019s no helping her to copy me correctly, she needs to live her own life not anybody else\u2019s. You don\u2019t see people walking around screaming that they\u2019re heartless only because they look up to the Weeknd, do you?", "Why does OP have main character syndrome? \n\nThere's a difference between your siblings hearing you listening to a band and then starts listening to similar music. Or asks to watch your favourite movie together. \nTo copying everything you do, the way you talk, the way you eat. Everything. \n\nIt's not different than if it was an aquentice or someone at the workplace who started copying you.\nJust because it's OP's sister, it doesn't make it less uncomfortable. \nThe sister frankly needs therapy to find herself or guidance at minimum from the parents. If she has done this from, they were small. She hasn't developed any sense of self. It can backfire hard later in life because the older she gets, the harder it will become to just stop copying OP and actually find herself and what she likes, on her own. \n\nAnd frankly, there are people who deal with this in their 30's or older with siblings stealing boyfriends because they can't find a copy of that guy to have their own. Or gets a job where their sibling works. \n\nWhat happens if she doesn't stop copying when OP goes to college. Will the sister quickly apply to the same college? If OP gets a boyfriend? Wedding, job? \nLetting the sister continue this copying and calling it \"she looks up to you\" is not doing the sister any favour. Far from it.", "I appreciate so much your understanding. People are accusing me of having the main character syndrome not realizing she actually hurt herself in the process of trying to be like me. I\u2019m not great, I am aware of that and I do not own styles and shows and all of that either. But people need to realize that it shows when somebody is truly interested in something and when they simply want to copy you. She\u2019s my sister and I absolutely adore her, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want a mini-me walking around. I want her to be happy and confident in who she is, because apart from the copying thing she is an amazing person. I\u2019d never want her to be sad, I want her to be herself.", "I also did this to my sister, to a point. She's three years older. Our elementary school let kids start playing instruments in 3rd grade. When I got the chance, I chose the same instrument as her. Then, one day when she was going out with her friends, she said she didn't want me coming with because I was her \"*little* sister\" and I was immediately embarrassed. I was maybe 10? By 16, sisters usually stop doing the exact same thing as each other.", "Seems like you already have all the answers, not sure why you\u2019re here asking strangers.", "Because clearly OP already knows in their own head that they are NTA. Nowhere in the rant posed as a question does it offer any insight in to why sister copies everything OP does. Except that she has since they were \u201cjust babies\u201d. Theres mention of \u201cshitty excuses\u201d that are dismissed but to me it sounds like there\u2019s been a family fall out and we have a 17 yo seeking validation from the internet. I bet OPs parents tell a very different story.", "I would definitely try encouraging individual interests she might have or even try finding something you guys can share and bond over. \n\nI am definitely the more emotional and needy sister and part of the copying was wanting close a connection with her. If you have something you both can share and enjoy together that might help.", "Or it was just so cute having two kids with only one year apart and \"look how cute it is they do everything together\" dressing them alike. \nMaking them build in besties from small.\nOlder sister wants to be their own person, sister didn't get the memo.\n\nThat is also a possibility. A lot of people do that with twins, or sisters/brothers born with almost no gap between them. \nParents who don't treat them as individual persons.\nAnd lots of twins/siblings have this problem that one sibling doesn't want to stop \"being the same person.\" Becouse it's scary. \n\nAnd there is no way to remember if it was the parents who started all this, other than the memory \"as far as I can remember she's always done this\" and parents just thought its cute now that younger sister wants to be like older sister. \n\"Mom asked her since when have you been scared of insects.\" \nis also mentioned."]}
