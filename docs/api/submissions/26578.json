Your friend is being really shady here. When she made the initial offer, she didn't tell you about the fee. Then, she lied about the cancellation policy. On top of that, her dad is skirting Airbnb's policies to take advantage of his daughters' friends. When you confronted her, she tried to turn it around on you. Her dad wasn't doing you a favor at all, and neither was she.", "NTA her dad didn\u2019t do you a favor at all\u2026 you just rented his available Airbnb. A favor would\u2019ve been letting you stay there or at the LEAST give you a friends or family discount. The fact that she lied when the policy was right there online is shady af and not what a real friend would do", "I have a feeling she pocketed the money and the dad has no idea", "I have news for you. That is not your friend", "NTA.  If a friend treated me like that, they\u2019d be an ex friend shortly after.", "NTA Put a review on your \"friend's\" bnb about the false cancellation policy.  Mention that you would never stay there again.  You were a guest, and have the right to post a review to warn her other\"friends.\". \n\nAll businesses deserve the review they have earned.", "Surely you mean ex friend? This would be it for me. NTA", "I bet she pocketed the money or at least some of it and said you wouldn\u2019t get any money back because she already spent it. \nAre you able to talk to her dad and ask about the rate?\nNTA and I wouldn\u2019t keep her as a friend.", "Technically since you stayed there I would go on there and write a review about your stay and how you were lied to about the policy because they didn't want to give up the money but they also booked it privately and not through the site so they didn't have to pay the fees to the company. Which could also give them bad marks with Airbnb.\nEdit judgment: NTA but your friend and her dad are. If she was willing to lie to you so she could keep the money and then when you find out and get mad SHE then gets mad about that, can you actually consider her a friend? 'With friends like these, who needs enemies' seems to fit this person", "NTA. Your friend is. First she tricked you into staying at their airbnb by making it seem like it was free. And then continued to act like she was doing you a favor after you paid for your stay. At that point it wasn't a favor it was a business transaction. And she is even more of an AH for lying to you about the cancellation policy. Not to mention her sick attitude about being mad at you for calling out her lie. She is manipulative as hell.", "Friend? Shit. Social media acquaintance, maybe. There was no cancelation policy because, it was straight cash to her. Life is full of people that pretend to like you to get business. Fake ass insurance agents & realtors especially.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWildfires are force majeure, so you are not entitled to a refund.\n\nAnd: You did not book via Airbnb, so THEIR cancelation policies do not apply.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
