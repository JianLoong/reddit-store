As an exmormon, I recommend finding a therapist who specializes in religious trauma (they exist) if you feel it could be helpful.\n\nMaintain your boundary - it's your wedding.", "NTA. She can say her prayer silently in her head. She doesn't need to perform her faith at your wedding and make your guests UNcomfortable.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom could make a silent prayer at your wedding, between her and the god she believes in. She did not have to insist on being allowed to say a something and and make you uncomfortable. \n\nI do wonder at the phrasing, that she is insisting you to let her say \"**at least** a prayer\", whether this might mean she might try to get  more than just a short, simple prayer if you give her the opportunity to address your guests.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules.

Don't apologize.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA - nothing is stopping her from silently saying a prayer for you, which is how it should be done. She wants to impose her faith on you and your other guests.", "NTA. To me this sounds more like a power move on her part and not so much about the prayer itself. Like, she could say a silent prayer if she wanted, but refusing to come at all unless she can do a performance prayer is manipulative/controlling.", "NTA.\n\nShe is welcome to pray as much as she wants. Silently and in a closet, the way Jesus said to.\n\nSeriously, if you wanted to extend an olive branch AND you're sure she wouldn't stand up and start praying aloud, you could incorporate a moment of silence and invite people to \"reflect\" on love, marriage, commitment, whatever.", "NTA. This isn't her wedding, it's your wedding. She thinks your guests should be \"comfortable\"? Tell her just how uncomfortable you've been for most of your life because of how she raised you. If she wants to say a prayer so bad she can do it in the privacy of her room or have her own wedding. It's extremely sad that she's willing to miss her daughter's wedding over this but it sounds like her religious views were always more important than you. If this is the hill she wants to die on, so be it. I hope you have a wonderful wedding.", "NTA. She can say a prayer in her head and she knows it. There is no need for it to be out loud.", "NTA.\nMaking sure your guests are comfortable is about telling them the terrain requirement so they can pick the right shoes, serving food everyone can eat and enjoys and so on. Religious elements (or lack thereof) are about the energy you and your partner want to take into this marriage. If your mother wants to pray for you, she can do so at home.", "NTA.

In private.", "NTA\n\nYour mom leading a prayer that no one asked for is likely to make all the other guests extremely uncomfortable.

If she really needs to pray, I\u2019m sure your venue can arrange a nice quiet side room for her to use for a couple minutes.", "NTA. This day is about you and your partner and nobody else. If she really wants to bless you with a prayer maybe she could write and frame one as part of your wedding gift. I\u2019m sure it would make a lovely addition to the downstairs toilet.", "NTA.\n\nHer religious beliefs are hers. She does not get to impose and forced them upon your wedding.", "NTA, it's your day, you can do whatever you like. You need to decide how important your mom's presence is for you.", "NTA. Its your wedding and you're allowed to have boundaries. This idea that anyone besides the couple have a right to make wedding decisions is absurd (unless the couple wants input, of course).  If it's that important to her, she can always silently say a prayer for you/the marriage/whatever.", "NTA. Your wedding is about you and what you want as a reflection of your relationship. She is absolutely welcome to say a prayer for you, but it doesn\u2019t need to be up at a podium or mic\u2019d, or shared with other people. Prayers are for God and not other people anyway, right?", "NTA.  If your mom wants to pray for you, she can do it on her own time and in her own place.

Time to set some hard boundaries, I think.", "Info: would your mother ever attend a non-Christian wedding? And if so, would she then demand to include herself in the program for the sake of her discomfort? I doubt she\u2019d give an ultimatum to any other person than you, so I\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s less about her hurt feelings and more so about the lack of control she has over you. You\u2019re not ridiculous in creating boundaries and more so, for sticking to your guns. She knows you love her and want her there, but here she is with her lovely ultimatum. Let her know you\u2019d appreciate her there but cannot force her to to be in an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d situation so therefor will miss her at the wedding NTA", "Oh geez, NTA.

It's your wedding and it should be how you and your fianc\u00e9 want it to be, not how your mother wants it to be.", "I\u2019m probably going to go through the same thing one day and your NTA. Fair warning, if you want zero religion at your wedding be aware that they could try to sneak it in during the speeches at the reception. I only say that because my mom is the type to try and be sneaky to get what she wants and she would 100% pull that during a toast speech", "NTA. My mom wanted to sing a worship song at mine and do a dance. Neither of those are... things she is good at.", "NTA.\n\nGive her a platform to embarrass you by asking God to lead you and your husband back to the fold? I think not.\n\nAnd that's one of the better-case scenarios. I wouldn't trust her farther than I could throw her.\n\nThe threat to not attend is simply to make it a win/win situation for herself. Either you knuckle under and she gets what she wants, or she gets to boycott your heathen wedding and cry like she's the victim.", "NTA.\n\n> She wasn\u2019t happy with that and now refuses to come to my wedding unless I apologise and let her say a prayer for my husband and I.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, but I respect your decision.

Ask her what Jesus would want her to do:  attend and be quiet or not attend and hurt her child's feelings.", "NTA.\n\nFeel free to revoke her invitation.", "Stand yr ground. Some mothers are control freaks and best kept out.", "NTA. I love Jesus but because you don\u2019t I would respect your belief. If a complete stranger can understand the differences in faith, then your mother can understand too. Stand your ground, as your marriage is built on the foundation between you and your partner. Sending you nothing but unconditional love on your very special day.", "NTA. The wedding is about you. You're a grown-up and you get to decide what your wedding ceremony looks like. I don't think there is much you could do about your mom praying quietly  on her own, but a demand to redesign your ceremony to include her praying is out of line, IMO.", "NTA. So she\u2019s given you an ultimatum, they usually do not end well for the person. Do not agree to this, it is your wedding not hers.", "NTA. You're not religious anymore. The wedding is about you and your partner and a prayer is not in line with your values anymore, sorry mom! You can accept a prayer or blessing before the ceremony in the privacy of your changing area or hotel or whatever. Beyond that, unless it's a Christian wedding with heavy Christian influence, it might feel out of place and maybe some guests might not be comfortable. You don't want it and it's all that matters.", "NTA - your wedding, your choices.  Tell her you've decided how your wedding and life to start with your partner.  She's welcome if she wants to play by your rules.    If she cannot live with that, let her stay away.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your wedding without yoru abusive mom,she is an AH.

It's ingrained in her. Guilt is how they control you. If you relent this time, more will be coming. I'm honestly surprised and impressed that you got out.\n\nMy husband was raised like that. It took him a long time to be ok in the regular world. His older brother is still very damaged and horrible at making friends. They were raised so strictly. They don't even visit their folks, just phone calls from time to time.", "NTA. \n\nTell her she will be missed. Do not apologize or you will be doing this until she dies. Just wait for the battle of the baptism.", "NAH \nShe'll probably pray out loud that you find Jesus and confess your life of sin which would absolutely ruin my day if a loved one said that for me. \nBut also the threat of Hell is very real to her and I can't blame her for that. \nYou could maybe work together on the words of the prayer, see if it's something you're comfortable with?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
