Well, okay, that child is an adult and can decide what to believe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe new child-in-law (CIL) was raised in a devoutly religious home but also decided on atheism.  CIL's family are still regular churchgoers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wedding was performed by a justice of the peace.  There was no mention of God or religion.  Both sets of parents accepted this, although I'm sure CIL's parents would have preferred otherwise.  We aren't really that concerned about it, being nonpracticing as I mentioned above.  We're just happy they finally tied the knot because we love CIL and think they make a good couple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mother is out of line to dictate what you should have in YOUR ceremony.  Even if she's paying for it (is she?), and there is a certain amount of say that she should have if she is (\"he who pays the piper calls the tune\"), there is a limit to how much power she should have.  And if she's NOT paying for it, well, then, she gets no say whatsoever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She is just trying to manipulate you. It\u2019s not about other people being comfortable, it\u2019s about your/future spouse\u2019s comfort. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She made religion more important than you for your entire childhood. If she chooses to let it keep her from your wedding, it's her loss.", "NTA, your wedding, not hers. You \"respected\" her beliefs when you lived in her house. This is your house, your wedding, she needs to respect your beliefs. You would never demand that she not pray in her house or at one of the ceremonies that you attended, she can do the same for you. \n\nGlad you broke free.", "NTA and wow, I am so glad I have been married a while and don't have to plan a wedding. \n\nIt seems either one or both of the bridal couple go bonkers with desires and demands for a perfect day, or someone is demanding the couple do everything for the guests. WTF? \n\nThis is your wedding, and you should plan the ceremony -- or lack thereof -- to be what you want. If you don't want anything religious, then don't have it. Your invited guests will either not come -- which tells you something about them -- or survive, perhaps being surprised at the lack of smiting.\n\nBut more importantly, hold your ground. Establishing boundaries is hard, and harder if you have to do it after giving way on anything.\n\nCongratulations and best of luck!", "NTA it\u2019s ok that she has her fandom but it\u2019s not ok to impose it on others.", "NTA given what she put you through and the fact that she has no plans of making amends, and is still trying to force religion down everyone else's throats, what would be the point of having her at your wedding anyway? She doesn't want to be a part of your life. \n\nHave people who love and support you and want to celebrate your marriage at your wedding. Leave your mother behind since she is choosing control over having a relationship with you", "Correction--she's refusing to come unless you let her say a prayer *out loud, in front of everyone*.  It's about optics, performance, image. No one is stopping her from saying a prayer.  Just stopping her from performing one.", "NTA.\n\nAnd let her stay home, and maybe try therapy for why you still cherish her and seek her approval?", ">\u201cis it not important to you that your guests are comfortable?\u201d\n\nThe answer should have been,  yes that's why I'm not letting you say a prayer.  There are many people that have a lot of trauma and discomfort regarding religion. She's being ridiculous and you are NTA", "NTA", "No hate quite like christian love... or is it no love quite like christian hate?\n\nanywho, nta and honestly it sounds like your wedding would be better off without your mom there (sorry to say)", "NTA. Your mom has serious control issues. If she can not accept you for you she doesn't need to be there.  \ud83d\udc9c", "That prayer will likely be asking god to save your soul before you burn in hell?  Be interesting if she would agree to have you read and approve, or not, whatever prayer she has in mind.  \n\nYou are not religious.  It is your wedding.  You get to decide.  If there are guests who would  be uncomfortable, they are free to stay at home.\n\nYour mom really believes and that your alienation is just a phase you will grow out of if she asks god to help you see the light.", "NTA. \n\nBe assured if you allow her to come to the wedding there will be a scene. Revoke her invitation.", "NTA. You have a right to have religion not included in your marriage ceremony. You made it clear your wedding would be secular. You could try to reason with your mother that as the almighty is omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent, it doesn't matter where she prays her blessing for your union. She can do it in the privacy of her hotel room, her kitchen, etc. She has no right to try to hijack your wedding or emotionally blackmail you into doing what you've made it clear that you have a distaste for. You're not ridiculous. It's YOUR wedding. If your mother chooses to sit it out, she may be missed.", "Yeah if this was about her face, she would be a good Christian and pray in silence. This comes down to she still wants control and power over you.", "But then she won't be able to draw attention to herself and show everyone what a fantastic Christian she is!", ">one prayer is relatively harmless\n\n\nIt's obviously bringing up a lot of childhood trauma for OP, so I disagree, but, even if it were harmless, so what? Tuna salad is relatively harmless, but no one would force anyone to serve it at their wedding. Mom is way, way overstepping here.", "Shush, you", "Bonus for using God Is A DJ"]}
