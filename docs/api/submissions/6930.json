So she had him read it at her wedding and it was beautiful. It does mention faith, but not a specific faith, but it's mostly about the nature and importance of love. In fact, it stresses that faith and devotion without love are nothing. Here, since I can't link it:\n\n---\n\n*If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.*\n\n*Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.*\n\n*Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.*\n\n*And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.*", "\"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men.

Lingering childhood issues from religious extremism are no joke. \nFrom my experience I would offer the following general bits of advice:\n- you are unlikely to convince your parents/mom to see this rationally from your point of view, and the more you try to more likely she is to dig in \n- this will probably be a recurring theme especially if you don\u2019t set a firm boundary early. For instance, my father in law for many years would insistent on standing and making a dramatic display of praying before eating at restaurants. Not only did the majority of the family at the table not appreciate it, I don\u2019t think the other diners or restaurant staff did either. This extended to basically any group event and it was much more about the display and being the center of attention than the purely religious side of it (which, frankly, would be more in line with a more reserved, humble prayer that was respectful of the other people around). \n- again just my experience, but the type of person who does this tends to view themselves as synonymous with the religious aspect of the event and view it as a personal attack if you are removing traditionally religious components from the event, which is of course your right to do- it is your wedding \n\nFor yourself I would suggest trying as much as possible to take the religious part out of this and shelve the ties to your childhood - again, I realize this is very hard to do- and think about the position you would take of a family member or friend wanted to make a speech and you either didn\u2019t want extensive speeches or didn\u2019t want that person to make one for whatever reason. You don\u2019t have to justify it extensively- having the answer be respectfully, simply \u201cthank you, but no. Your presence at the wedding is all we need\u201d is more than enough.
