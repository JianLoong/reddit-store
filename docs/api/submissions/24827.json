I work a (9-5) for most days of the week and do most of the house work at home as well as manage the kids. \n\nOne night I came home from work and I decided to check up on my children. I first checked up on my daughter and then my son, however when I walked into his room is noticed that he switched tabs on his school laptop. I first was suspicious of his behavior as he is a kid who would rather play his \"War Thunder\" than finish his due work. I obviously questioned him asking if he was playing video games, at first he denied it but I didn't believe him as his behavior indicated to me that he was lying. \n\nI then asked his permission (in a calm tone) to check over his computer, in which he begrudgingly obliged to. I first checked through his desktops, where I didn't find him playing any games, so i then checked through his search history where I found some very disturbing material. I saw that he was watching and playing Video games during school. This agitated me at first however i decided to let him off with a warning, this was until I saw a row of searches \"methamphetamine\" and \"how to make methamphetamine step by step\" (METH). This was the last straw for me as over the years I have had my fair share of stupidity with his behavior. The fact that he searched up METH during his lessons made me **very** concerned.\n\nNaturally, I was worried that my 16 year old son was trying to make METH with his friends at school. So I had to contact the appropriate authorities in order to discuss with them what I should do. \n\nI then calmly walked upstairs to notify my son that i had contacted authorities to smooth over this crazy situation. The authorities suggested that I let them speak to my son, and they had a discussion where my son eventually apologized (after arguing with them for an extensive period of time about how it was \"all good and a joke\").\n\nI am now unsure as to how to punish my son as he has caused a large amount of disturbance within the household. I have let him off the hook to many times with instances where he has lied about not doing homework, or he slammed the car door (ultimately damaging parts of the door), and has stayed up past midnight to finish off a mathematics investigation assignment that he irresponsibly did not complete during the large amount of in-class time that he was given.\n\nHe then shouted at me stating that calling authorities was unjustified and how \"you are such a Karen mum!\". What should I do now??? \n\nHe says that it was just a joke and that he wasn\u2019t really going to make meth. I don\u2019t know if I should believe him or not. I feel like I\u2019ve been too lenient with him in the past and that he needs some discipline. But maybe I did the wrong thing and invaded his privacy, I was only just concerned for him. \n\nAm i the Asshole?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692241554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tayx3/aita_for_contacting_authorities_on_my_child_16m/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good relationships are built on trust that runs both ways. \n\nSecondly, he searched up how to make meth, that doesn't mean he wanted to actually do it. I search things all the time out of curiosity. It also has a connection to a huge TV show, Breaking Bad, this sort of shit will come up in conversation and people will look it up.\n\nCalling the police to a search like that is a complete overreaction.

A school laptop is expected to be used for schoolwork, with the ability to use it recreationally with regulation. What were these other disturbing searches that you found so appalling? Violent video games? Porn?\n\n>I then calmly walked upstairs to notify my son that i had contacted authorities to smooth over this crazy situation.\n\nSo you left the room, called the police and then told your son they were coming over?

He plays video games during school, doesn't do homework, is a sassy teen who slams doors, and therefore is a future druggie who needs the cops to straighten him out? No. You were punishing him for all of these very very minor things all at once. You wanted him to be afraid, not to learn to manage his time better.\n\nYou need to sit down, apologize and learn how to communicate with your son. Open communication is extremely important in any relationship, especially parental. You have failed to do this and in the process probably traumatized your son. Do you understand how scary it would be to be 'reported' to the police, and then have them come to your home to scold you? Be honest, your goal was to scare and humiliate him.\n\nI cannot see how your son will ever trust you again. You are the only parent in his life, and you treated him terribly.
