Perhaps if the jokes go too far you should talk to him about it, the jokes don\u2019t seem to be coming from a place of hate but perhaps ignorance. A lot of friends make jokes like this and frankly if no one in the group is offended it ain\u2019t that big a deal.", "NTA.  You can decide who you hang with.  It's too bad you didn't let him know in a kind way that he was offensive, you could have saved him some heartache.  I would hope that my friends would do the same for me.", "NTA It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s truly racist. If you guys enjoy each other\u2019s company and he\u2019s not offensive, I give you all the respect in the world for staying loyal when no one else will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially depending on what these jokes specifically were.\n\nThe group chat thing was somewhat immature but given their \u2018\u2019cancelling\u2019\u2019 was showing the person \u2018here\u2019s evidence of you doing something shitty we don\u2019t want to be friends anymore\u2019 it doesn\u2019t appear to vary substantially from what might have been done in a regular conversation where the friendship is ended.", "NTA. If you're not offended, there's no need for your other friends to be offended on your behalf.", "NTA you choose your friends not people around you", "INFO\n\nI mean\u2026what was the joke? That detail seems very important.", "Yta and I can't wait til you turn 30 and wonder why your support system is so broken. You aren't helping yourself or anyone else who finds themselves in uncomfortable situations as a Poc. You deserve to be dropped by the black community tbh. Ewwww", "You chose your own friends, in this climate you should run away from any friends who are part of the \u201ccancel culture\u201d . If your white friend was racist he wouldn\u2019t be your friend. Also jokes are free for all, none of those friends would get offended if any of you guys made a \u201cracist\u201d white joke. Do what ever you want to do. Your friends are the assholes.", "YTA. Not the AH for keeping your friend, you can hang out with whoever you want, and your friends can do the same. \n\nYTA for excusing racism. Like 'Yes, he's made a lot of racist comments, but remember all the good things he's done for you?\"\n\nJust because even if you aren't \"offended by racism\", doesn't mean other people have to be cool with it. If your friend is making racist \"jokes\" about you, then he is making racist \"jokes\" about black people. Even though he's saying the comments *to* you, he's saying it *about* the whole race.\n\nAlso, you said he makes these \"jokes\" to cope. He's not chill, he lashes out to make himself feel better.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nFirst off, your friends are your choice. The joke was directed at you and If it doesn\u2019t matter to you then it shouldn\u2019t matter to them. Making a separate group chat to provide \u201cevidence\u201d of what your friend did rather than just straight up telling him that they didn\u2019t approve are the joke isn\u2019t very mature of them. Also where did they get this evidence? Is your friend sending racist memes to your other friends? \n\nRather than canceling him they should\u2019ve tried educating him or even given him ideas for a different genre of jokes that are less offensive.", "YTA, and you will be judged by the company you keep. Racist language isn't 'just words' or 'free speech hurr durr.' Why you'd want to be friends with someone from another race who uses slurs against your race is a mystery to me, especially if the only way he's learned\u2014by age 20\u2014to cope with stress is to use a slur against your race is not a mystery for me to solve. But expect to have others lose interest in remaining friends with you as you hang on to your racist friend.", "No, your other friends are for sure though.  If they don't want to be his friends great for them,  but pressuring you as well is where I draw the line.  Feel free to be offended, but don't expect everyone to feel the same for you.  I assume his jokes have no malice behind them, you don't like them? Speak up and move on.", "NAH, you\u2019re welcome to retain your friend but your other friends have every right to drop him and look at you poorly for associating with someone they know to be a racist.", "I accidentally snuck up on him and he said \"Dam dude you must be batman because you sure are my dark knight\"", "The joke was unacceptable enough to get people mad. \n\nAsking for it on reddit is bating a ban.", "I don't know how me turning 30 has anything to do with this or what you mean by support system but I was raised to not be offended by jokes", "Not all his jokes are racist he jokes around when he is nervous or stressed simple as that my friend want to cancel him because they sometimes heard him tell me one of the racist jokes", "More or less he retweets every meme he finds on his Twitter hoping to make someone laugh sometimes he isn't aware of the context.", "I think I specified he dosent use slurs but I won't mind if he did and he jokes about everything sensitive or not \n\nOverall the dude is chill and kind had my back for as long as I can remeber", "Ok, that\u2019s really not bad at all. Yeah NTA.", "That sounds more like a pick-up line than a joke. Odd joke, but it doesn't seem offensive. NTA"]}
