And some of the family asked you to tone it down because their kids are envious.\n\nYou've said in your replies the kids are on the social media list, so they see the images.\n\nThere's a simple solution. Some social media allows you to tailor who the images are posted to. You can tailor it by choosing the audience as Family except...\n\nYour older children spoil her. She brags. You flaunt it directly to the other kids on social media. As a result, other children in the family are envious.

Letting your youngest brag about getting whatever she wants whenever she wants is socially tactless and not a good habit for her to develop especially as she starts getting into the tween years.

YTA.", "You know, you may be unique in your family but you\u2019re far from the only parent with successful kids. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s surprising to you since most people aren\u2019t obnoxious about it.\n\nYour 10 year old isn\u2019t \u201cspreading joy\u201d. She\u2019s bragging and emulating her mother. Trying to make herself feel superior by making others feel inferior.\n\nYTA", "That's fine. Bragging is tacky. That's all anyone is trying to say. You posting that is opening yourself to criticism. If you don't care, continue. If you do care, learn how to be tactful about it", "Don't worry, there are a lot of jealous, bitter people on reddit.", "This is perfectly reasonable. Enjoy it. The downvotes are BS. I\u2019m", "As you should be\n You've done nothing wrong. At all.", "Them being raised they impacted them in a way that made them work hard. Your youngest is being spoiled and will probably lack that work ethic because of it.", "It's gone straight to your head and you've become obnoxious, arrogant and attention seeking on social media, the latter of which should really be beneath someone old enough to have kids of your oldest kids' ages. Your youngest will develop an entitled attitude, bully people who she feels are beneath her, and alienate her cousins etc even more if you don't rein it in now. \n\nYTA", "Exactly she's YOUR baby, you should be embarrassed that it's your older kids that are spoiling your daughter and not you, that she has to go to them if she wants or needs something because she can't get it from you, it's not up to them to provide for YOUR child.", "Have YOU fixed your financial situation? Doesn\u2019t sound like it. Your youngest has a different life because of her sisters, and you think that\u2019s something to brag about. Awkward.", "And instead of actually improving her financial prospects (like starting a college fund or paying for tutoring or an extracurricular) they just shower her with useless gifts\u2026.\n\nBut they still have college loans. And one day they\u2019ll have their own kids. The gravy train will run out, and your daughter will blame you for leaving her with absolutely nothing.", "You seem to be taking a lot of pride in the fact that the others and their children are not as well of as your older two, which seems a little odd given that you admit that your own financial situation is bad. That doesn\u2019t make you a bad or lesser person but it also doesn\u2019t make them or their kids bad is lesser people either.  It would be nice if you could instead of showing off the material gifts, focus on the feelings behind those gifts.  Showing a little bit of grace and empathy (and teaching your daughter that too) would go a long way\u2014I don\u2019t agree with that \u201cof course\u201d she is going to brag. That is a natural impulse but that doesn\u2019t make it an appropriate action.", "You\u2019re the relative everyone whispers about behind your back. I guarantee they dont like you.", "The gift giving isn't what is tacky. You and your daughter bragging about it (both of yall bragging is on YOU) is incredibly tacky. Also, if the gift-giving happens around the other kids and they get nil that's tacky. \n\nBefore I officially gained stepkids, they didn't get gifts from my extended family. So gift-giving was done separately. No child deserves to feel less than because of the circumstances of adults. Circumstances you presumably share per your own version.", "Now that's an 8yo who would teach some adults a thing or two!", "My children said the same thing.", "Okay bragging \"My son got a promotion to VP.\" Not okay bragging, \"Look how many things we have! So much more than you!\"", "There\u2019s no need to attack the kid, all young kids brag about stuff. She\u2019ll grow up\n\nThat being said, OP\u2019s social media post does sound cringe af, so yta", "How would OP feel we\u2019re the roles reversed and she wasn\u2019t spoiled and there was no way for her to be and her having to watch cousins get all this materialistic stuff! Like I commented OP doesn\u2019t have to show the gifts and professions just show a pic of the kids together with something like \u201c Sisters for life\u201d \u201c can count on them no matter what\u201d. Stop showing off the money. There\u2019s more ways to show love", "Their own parents could probably filter and not show it to their kids.", "I mean, even SHE is struggling and can\u2019t afford to provide those things for her own daughter because they are financially \u201cbad off,\u201d and she still doesn\u2019t have the sense to not brag about how the older daughters were able to help fill that gap. How odd.", "That is such flawed logic because where is the line? Are folks with poor family not allowed to post pictures of a vacations they take because they can\u2019t afford it? Not allowed to post a new outfit online  because a cousin hasn\u2019t been able to afford new clothes?  Not post about buying a home because someone else will likely be renting forever?\n\nSomeone is ALWAYS going to have more than you unless you\u2019re a billionaire. Folks should concentrate on their own lives and be grateful for what the DO have. If you can\u2019t handle seeing posts about others success GET OFF THE INTERNET.", "The way the older two were raised has had such an impact had shaped them so much emotionally they are clearly over compensating so that never happens to the younger one too like they felt so shitty at Xmas and birthdays when they grew up they never want the little one to go through that and are wildly overcompensating in this way and op thinks this is fucking fine and great omg it\u2019s so far from that. \n\nThis is the Xmas equivalent of me who panic buys food because it was sometimes not there as a kid and now my house is rammed with food at all times.", "Yes.  At least the kid has the excuse of being 10 and having OP as a role model.", "It's not relevant whatsoever. You just enjoy bragging and flaunting all of the things your daughter gets. It's fine to be proud of your oldest two, but you're taking it way too far to the point where you and your daughter are rubbing  it in other people's faces. \n\nIt's honestly not at all surprising that your youngest daughter brags about everything so much considering that you do the exact same thing. It's very obviously learned behavior and it is going to cause massive issues for your daughter in the future if you don't put a stop to it. No one likes a braggart.", "Their jobs are **only** relevant because you chose to make the quantity of gifts the explicit focus of the post. YTA.", "Exactly how much money do you think your doctor daughter has? She\u2019s 29, which means she just finished or is in her last year of residency. Residency does not pay well, then she also has to pay back medical school debt.\n\nMy husband is also a doctor and just now making the \u201cbig bucks\u201d and he finished his residency 5 years ago \n\nDoctors don\u2019t make good salaries the minute they graduate", "If they had those jobs but didn't love her they wouldn't get her the gifts. Wouldn't you say the love part is more important than the material things part?", "There is more to life than material things.   They could still take care of her if they were say \u201cjust\u201d a teacher.", "So then it\u2019s not about their love for her, it\u2019s about their money. That\u2019s bragging. And you\u2019re the one who is instilling in your daughter the idea that love and gifts are connected and that the number of gifts she gets determines how joyful she is. That\u2019s bad parenting.", "Their jobs are absolutely irrelevant.", ">Your sentence gives the impression that anyone who loves their sister will give them many gifts otherwise it means they don't love her. This will not be a nice thing to say imo\n\nLOL, you just confirmed for me that this entire post is BS. You are obviously trolling for outrage and argument.", "oh so you\u2019re just elitist. you don\u2019t care about the relationship between your daughters, you just like that they have money now and can spend that money on your youngest (which inadvertently takes financial pressure off of you). you don\u2019t want to brag about them caring for youngest, you want to brag about money.

They become adults and no longer receive money for college when that\u2019s completed. I don\u2019t care about a gift forgotten in a day and want them to make their own life. \n\nYTA", "It almost feels like op is taking credit for her daughters success in life which, given her tone and their own financial situation they probably managed in spite of her rather than because of her. There\u2019s something that comes off as selfish and gloating from op which doesn\u2019t seem like a supportive and hard working place for these girls to grow from, they youngest certainly won\u2019t be the same imo. Probably chronically spoiled monster.", "Just tone it down, how are you not getting this?", "You don't HAVE to, but they've asked you to stop so you have a choice: a.) Listen to your family members who are telling you that bragging about your child's excessive gifts is frustrating and upsets their children, or b.) Don't pay attention to them and continue to post what you want.\n\nThe considerate, non-asshole thing to do is tone it down because it upsets some of your family and doesn't cost you anything. You have every *right* to keep posting, but ignoring your family and doing whatever you want regardless of their feelings is like the definition of inconsiderate. Being inconsiderate of other people's feelings makes you an asshole.", "You know exactly why sharing these posts showing your successful daughters \u2018generosity\u2019 is upsetting to the members of your family who have less, you said so in the original post. They\u2019ve told you before. And you\u2019re still doing it. And the amount of arguing you\u2019re doing in the comments is incredible.  \n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that your older daughters have overcome a difficult start in life and can spoil their sister. Your sharing it online is literally just you bragging about it to your family and friends. \n\nYou are being a massive asshole, and every time you argue on here the doubling down just affirm that more. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being proud of your daughter\u2019s achievements and their support for you and your youngest. Shoving it down your families throats on socials for clout is classless and I\u2019m sure a massive turn-off for everyone that sees the posts. Grow up.", "They are your family. If you love and care about them, why not do something that would keep them from feeling hurt?", "It\u2019s not even your life you\u2019re bragging about, you\u2019re not the wealthy one.

But posting in the group chat knowing the audience you\u2019re sending these pictures to might not share the same happiness or energy you have is setting yourself up for failure and arguments. No one is saying don\u2019t post in the group chat just be more mindful of what you\u2019re posting. Don\u2019t forget the older two are grown they don\u2019t have to entertain this, but you got the youngest who\u2019ll be exposed to cousins her age who\u2019ll probably let her know what\u2019s being thought of her, parents talk kids listen and kids also talk\u2026 don\u2019t forget you were a kid too. Be proud, be happy, just be wary of how you publicize it bc if it was just you posting about you then sure but she\u2019s a kid so you\u2019re setting her up for life \u2026"]}
