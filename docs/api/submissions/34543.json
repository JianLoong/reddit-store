But if you know that her cousins have less, you should tell her not to brag and show off, knowing it'll make them feel bad. It's your right to post the pictures with that caption, but it does feel a little obnoxious.\n\nYTA", "So you posted that photo with that caption to family, and the families, including cousins saw it. And some of the family asked you to tone it down because their kids are envious.\n\nYou've said in your replies the kids are on the social media list, so they see the images.\n\nThere's a simple solution. Some social media allows you to tailor who the images are posted to. You can tailor it by choosing the audience as Family except...\n\nYour older children spoil her. She brags. You flaunt it directly to the other kids on social media. As a result, other children in the family are envious. That will turn into resentment.\n\nYTA\n\nSuggesting you tone it down is a reasonable ask. They didn't ask you to teach your child not to brag, but we all know that's not nice.", "NTA but your response of \u2018it\u2019s hardly my problem\u2019 made me think twice", "I'm going against the grain here: YTA. \n\nYour older kids aren't under any obligation *whatsoever* to buy gifts for cousins if they don't feel like it, and they should never feel pressured or guilted into doing so. \n\nHowever. Letting your youngest brag about getting whatever she wants whenever she wants is socially tactless and not a good habit for her to develop especially as she starts getting into the tween years. It's also tactless continuing to flex online about how inundated with good luck she is for having two wealthier older siblings if you know a) the situation is not the same for the rest of your family who will be seeing the posts and b) without the generosity of your older daughters you wouldn't be in this position.\n\nIt's admirable that your older daughters want to pay your youngest's way in life so she doesn't have to struggle how they struggled, but flexing online about it is not a good way to repay their generosity. That doesn't mean that you have to be hush-hush about your older daughters helping the younger one, or that she can't be excited about a gift she loves, but if she 'likes to brag to everyone' and you're condoning that behaviour while also flexing in the family GC yourself, that's asshole behaviour.", "NTA but kind of tacky to brag about your kids\u2019 professions and the amount of gifts your other kid got all in one fell swoop", "I can understand seeing other kids get things you can\u2019t. I lived with it my whole life because I was raised by my grandma. However, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s fault that I\u2019m broke.", "Nta. Life is unfair. I don\u2019t see how her cousins have anything to do with this.", "Nta", "Yta but not for your daughters buying their sister gifts. Are they saying tone it down maybe because you\u2019re bragging or because of the gifts?", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s the parents that are jealous. And it\u2019s not your older children\u2019s responsibility to buy everyone gifts. They can spend their time and money how they like, especially on their sister.", "Info: How old are the jealous kids and how are they viewing your picture?", "NTA. Other people shouldn\u2019t dictate how your children spends their money and what they enjoy doing. Others are projecting their insecurities onto you.", "NTA. Your older kids are choosing to spoil their younger sister out of love and generosity, and it's not your responsibility to manage others' jealousy. You're simply sharing your joy as a parent.", "NTA but tone down the publicizing if it's causing conflicts in your family.  It's never necessary to flex online, really.  Just be happy that your daughter is so loved by her sisters!", "[deleted]", "She is not trying to show off she is just trying to share her joy with others. Talking about her sisters makes her happy", "The kids can still see the pictures from their parents social media accounts. Am I supposed to hide everyone? Other people's jealousy is not really my problem", "I'm not trying to brag I just like to post about something that makes me happy like everyone else does. Seeing my older kids be so successful that they can afford to spoil my baby makes me happy and I want to share it", "I'm just proud of my kids and happy for the younger one lol", "My older kids had to be raised this way because of our financial situation I'm just so glad that my baby doesn't have to go through that", "They think my older kids should at least give one gift to their cousins as well and it's unfair that my daughter gets everything", "Ranging from 8 to 15\n\nBuying phones for young kids is very normal in my family. They have access to social media(with parent's supervision of course)", "Yes I believe they are just jealous. Some of them also have older kids about the same age as mine who are not as successful", "I agree. My family just thinks that it's tacky that they are adults abd well off but won't buy gifts for the other kids but I don't think they are obligated to buy anything for them", "True, but it might still come off that way to others. She can still talk about her sisters, but she might not want to go on and on about all the things her sisters are giving her. She can, if she wants to, but it might just be a good idea to let her know that it might give the wrong impression.", "it does make you an asshole though, if you make no effort to protect these children's feelings", "You literally said in your post she likes to brag. Tbh, your kid sounds like a brat.", "Could you be proud of them for their generosity, their love for their sibling, their hearts? \n\n\u201cWhen your older sisters love you more than anything. Lucky girl!\u201d", "Ofcourse they would want that, but if the roles were reversed probably not. \nI grew up less fortunate than my cousins, and my parents always explained to me that we just weren\u2019t in a position to do or get as many things as my cousins did. It\u2019s not your, or your children\u2019s job, to educate the cousins. I understand where they might be coming from, but unless your family is SUPER close, I don\u2019t see how it is your problem.", "And you have them added?", "Okay that explains a lot. Let them say whatever they want and let you children be however they are as long as they are happy", "OP is also a brat. That\u2019s such an obnoxious thing to post.", "Well their jobs are relevant here. If they loved her more than anything but didn't have those jobs they wouldn't be able to spoil her as much. \n\nYour sentence gives the impression that anyone who loves their sister will give them many gifts otherwise it means they don't love her. This will not be a nice thing to say imo", "Yes why not? I have a family only page with all the family added", ">Well their jobs are relevant here. If they loved her more than anything but didn't have those jobs they wouldn't be able to spoil her as much.\n\nWhy is it important that the rest of the world knows that they have jobs that allow them to buy lots of gifts, though? Isn't it enough that you know and are happy?", "Then I'm gonna say NTA but that if you continue to make outward gloating posts that you run the risk of being.\n\nThey aren't entitled to more or fancy gifts, but you know you didn't have to phrase it that way.", "They all post about their lives I don't understand why I have to stop posting about this part of my life for their sake", "Because you've been aware that phrasing things certain ways hurts others and you're an adult who can work under the premise of compassion.\n\nIf not, you become an AH.\n\nI never said you couldn't post things, you just don't have to be all like \"look how lucky my daughter is for having something I know you don't!\" You're aware of the issue and know how to be kind... I assume.", "Yeah, very much agree. I think it's all in the phrasing and in knowing one's audience. And trying to be a little kind if you know something is hurting someone. One has the right to post what they want...but sometimes it feels better to be kind."]}
