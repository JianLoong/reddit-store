However I know Japan, just like most countries, aren\u2019t the most favorable to black people (I hear they are like that with most tourists anyway). But I\u2019ve been at this for a while and already made a friend over there that could show me and my other friend (fatima) around. \n\nOriginally all 3 of us were supposed to go, but Fatima and I agreed that jade doesn\u2019t know how to read a room and could make this trip less fun for us.

Jade is absolutely pissed.\n\nI know without us the trip is financially unattainable for her. But I just want to want to have a good time without everything having to be about oppression. \n\nJade isn\u2019t talking to either one of us and my mom called me saying how I was an ass for doing that to her. Fatima says she feels bad and thinks we should reconsider if she makes a promise. I feel like jade is incapable of making such a promise because she loves the attention. But I also don\u2019t want to lose my friend over this. But I just want to have fun.\n\nEdit: thanks for validating my feelings about the situation. Someone said I might be dealing with a missing stair type of person, and they\u2019re are absolutely correct. Getting this out brought up past memories of this person that still aggravate me to this day. I can afford the trip by myself if I get a cheaper hotel room, I\u2019m going to tell fatima that if she wants to go with jade then I\u2019ll just go by myself. I don\u2019t want to be bullied around by jade anymore.\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nIt\u2019s official jade and I aren\u2019t going on any trips together much less be friends.", "created_utc": 1673438440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10930si/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_traveling_with_my/", "score": 633, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One thing I do know about Japan is that they have very definite social mores and overstepping, being rude/impolite will cause trouble.

One of the good things about visiting with other cultures is learning about them, being discreet and observing until you are able to navigate the social circles in the expected way. Frankly, it doesn't seem as if Jane would be able to or even interested in doing this. I take it that you and Fatima would not feel comfortable being looked at as the rude foreigners. As for racism, I have heard this too. There is supposed to be some people in Japan that originally came from Korea 400 years ago. They are still being referred to as \"the strangers\". I don't know if there is any particular racism against black people, though. Still, it is will undoubtedly be a great experience for you. Happy trails!", "NTA.

Granted, you COULD end up going with her and have the friendship completely break down because of some potential drama and resentment from a ruined vacation. \n\nYou and your other friend voiced your concerns and instead she was obstinate about going her way if necessary.

Her aggressive attitude will make your trip very very unpleasant, because she will perceive any innocent ignorance as an insult and a dig.

Now I\u2019m mid thirties? I choose my battles. No one is asking Jade to shut up entirely about what they believe in, but it\u2019s not a bad thing to not freak out entirely at EVERY thing that happens. You assess the environment, you assess the other person and what they could potentially do to you if you say something. I\u2019m AFAB, and I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d.

It would be a pain, and there\u2019s a few welcoming onsens that allow tattooed folks, but most do not allow you in. That\u2019s not exactly fair, but I would have to do it anyway. I wouldn\u2019t be strolling around with a sign advertising my sexuality, not that I do anyway haha but you see what I mean. There are certain cultures we do not get automatically accepted in, because of their conservative nature. I do not think it\u2019s a good shout to take Jade with you to Japan.

In fact my most lively encounters have been with other foreigners.  It\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t racist A H in Japan there are.  And there is alot of strange justification by Japanese people as to why some of these racist behaviors are justified.  Such as a restaurant in Ueno in Tokyo banning foreigners.

All my friend had said was height hair color etc but asked to determine a race, because it couldn\u2019t be a Japanese person pickpocketing another Japanese person.  \n\nBut compared to some other countries violence is low in Japan.  I will say however bringing a highly confrontational person to a culture that is out side of their knowledge is not a good idea.

She may be able to get away with her behavior here in the US, but that type of behavior may not fly in Japan, or any other foreign country, for that matter. Sounds like she needs to start exerting emotional self-control. Side note: She's incredibly stupid for carrying on an argument with two rednecks in an open carry, stand-your-ground state.", "NTA\nI get why they would be hurt but if it\u2019s the best in not only keeping you comfortable but safe, then it\u2019s the right choice. If they\u2019re going to pick a fight and not back down every time there\u2019s any size of an issue, it\u2019ll just escalate and become severely unsafe in a foreign country. It will also make you miserable, and then you might as well have stayed home \n\nMy best friend is black and has been told many horror stories about black folx going to South Korea and Japan which is what we\u2019ve been saving up for, one of our main concerns is making the trip as safe as possible.", "NTA.  Considering the recent events where travelers have gotten in trouble overseas, she\u2019s a liability because she thinks she is always right and won\u2019t back down from a fight.", "Dotn even gotta read the whole thing. NTA. Even if someone IS your friend, and you like them most if the time, its super important to be 100% confident about the people you're travelling with.", "Why would you go an a trip with annoying people? Just in general, it's not a useful practice. Doesn't make any sense. NTA", "NTA, I'm glad you have made the decision to no longer be friends with someone who is willing to put other people in dangerous situations so she can feel like a hero. Someone else placing their own self-importance and adrenaline rush over the safety of others is someone you shouldn't be friends with", "Jade sounds exhausting to be honest. Not everything has to be treated at defcon 1 or 2. NTA and enjoy your trip.", "NTA. People like Jade think that they have to voice every thought or opinion in their head. Not everybody gives a flying fuck what you think or feel.  They sound utterly exhausting to be around.", "As someone who knows a shitload of rednecks, it's probably a 93/7% mix I'd say. Depends on what you're talking about, but if you're yelling, it's just... don't. Just don't lol.", "Family friend", "Bro what \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "If this is true I\u2019ll take her then. Only then she will learn a lesson", "Google says it\u2019s true but I want to hear some first hand accounts of this in action. I mean not from you! Don\u2019t go with anyone who you think might end up in a burrito", "My dad is one of the loudest people I know and he\u2019s managed not to get arrested in Japan on the many trips he\u2019s taken if that helps. He\u2019s also Texan. Traveling with him can get embarrassing and cringy."]}
