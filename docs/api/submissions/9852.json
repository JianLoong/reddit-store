He was abandoned, and he's hurt. Yes, she went through cancer, but that doesn't invalidate his pain. He was 7. That is so young. You lack compassion. That poor kid has nothing to apologize for, but you do.", "YTA.\n\nHe was 7 years old when he was sent there.\n\nToday he is only 14 years old... barely a teenager. You are now an adult.\n\nYou still feel he needs to shut up.\n\nCome on ma'am.  It seems only you need to grow up here.\n\nDefinitely YTA.", "YTA. who the hell gives you the right to tell him how he feels. He was abandoned. Parents 100 billion percent abandoned him. Only saw him once in 3 years... ARE YOU JOKING.\n\nlets turn it around. why did you never go visit him when you were 14 and 15? Unaccompanied children travel across country all the time. How many times did you call. What effort did you make", "YTA. This isn't the pain olympic. Sure, your sister had it worst, but your brother had to be SENT AWAY. He was rejected from your family for YEARS.  Yes, you parents had a good reason to do it and were backed to the wall.. But NO, it doesn't make it ok ! That doesn't mean your brother doesn't still have a trauma from it. If anything, you need to be apologizing for invalidating your brother's feelings.", "YTA\n\nYes he was abandoned. The fact that you belittled him and invalidated his feelings, which are completely valid cause they are true since your parents did abandon him, and the fact that you think you are owed an apology from him proves that you are as much of an AH as your parents, maybe worse.", "YTA - imagine how traumatic it would be for a 7 year old kid to be shipped off to the other side of the country and never see your family for YEARS. Also how many times did he see those grandparents before? Cause if they couldn\u2019t make visits happen for YEARS, I\u2019d assume none of you have spent significant amounts of time with them to know how living with them is. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide how someone feels about these types of events and your parents should seriously consider some family counselling. Also your brother got shipped off and has no idea what the family did or did not go through.\n\nHe is still pretty young so he probably does not know how to even begin to process this type of resentment and abandonment.", "YTA, your baby brother WAS abandoned, it doesn\u2019t matter that your sister had cancer all he saw was ALL HIS FAMILY TOGETHER EXCEPT HIM.\nHe had no parents for 3 years. They saw him ONCE and you expect him to be thankful. \nSeriously?!", "YTA. \n\nThis sounds oddly similar to a post that is currently on the front page, just written from a different POV. \n\nBut, in the small case this isn't just a writing excercise, you are still an asshole.  He deserves to have his feelings as well.  Your brother was sent away for 3 years when you only saw him one time.  That is going to fuck with a child, and he deserves to discuss his feelings of abandonment.  Even if you don't see it that way, you didn't experience what he did, so its not your place to tell him he is wrong.  Also, the fact that YOU think you deserve an apology is absurd.", "YTA, your parents did abandon him, both of your siblings had it bad. YOU should apologise.", "YTA\n\nThere was literally another story exactly like this but from the mother's POV where she sent her daughter to the Grandmother\n\n\nDon't know if it is a troll, but if not, don't invalidate your brother's feelings. Listen, your sister went through hell, but your brother was forced away when he was a child. You literally only saw him once...  Once.\n\nThink about how a little boy was without his parents for Three years, wondering if they loved him. Just think about the pain he went through.\n\nTwo things can be correct at once", "YTA. He *was* abandoned for 3 years.", "YTA. Have you ever heard the quote, \u201cjust because someone has it worse than you, doesn\u2019t change what _you_ have\u201d.

That is extremely traumatic and he needs therapy to help him through it. You never got sent away. There is a huge difference between having it tough and being 'rehomed.' You do not deserve an apology from him. His feelings are his own and perfectly valid.", "YTA - Your brother lost his family for THREE YEARS. He is justified in feeling abandoned.", "YTA. That sounds like an insanely difficult situation for your parents, and they were between a rock and a hard place. But this post reads like you really have no empathy for the trauma caused to your bro that he was relocated, without his family, across the country, for a long period of time during a formative year. That situation for your bro likely caused him to have some issues relating to abandonment, rejection, etc. and those feelings are reasonable for what he experienced! You just seem hung up on the comparison - that if what he experienced wasn't as bad as or worse than your sister's cancer, he has no right to complain, and that's not ever a fair argument. \n\nYou can have compassion for both your parents and your brother. You can opt not to pass judgment on them for what they had to do, while respecting that it still caused him harm.", ">I want an apology first\n\noh boy, that poor kid was abandoned. Yes your parents did it for good reasons but doesn't make it any better for your brother. He had to live with that and without his family for all that time and you don't get to tell him how he feels.

Holy...I can not imagine how it must have felt to be sent away for 3 years. He has the right to feel abandoned, I would be WAY more upset than he is. Stop invalidating your brother's feelings.

You don't get to minimize the feelings of a child because you don't agree with them.", "YTA. Your brother\u2019s trauma and response to that situation is completely separate from what your sister went through. And he was a seven year old child.

Both our parents had to work around the clock to afford her treatment, we had to move into a two bedroom apartment, and overall things were terrible for 3 years.\n\nOur mom had to spend all her spare time at the hospital with our sister, and our dad was always working, so they couldn't really watch us. I was old enough to stay home alone when I needed to, but our brother was only 7 so he had to be sent to our grandparents house. They live across the country so we only saw my brother once in those 3 years\n\nLong story short our sister lived and is cancer free, our brother moved back 4 years ago and things are mostly good. The only issue is our brother. I get that what he went through must have been rough, but he acts like he had it worse than our sister. He likes to tell his friends that we \"abandoned him\" when he was little, which really pisses me off since I saw how heartbroken our parents were at sending him away.\n\nWhen our sister was talking about a christmas she spent on chemo, he said \"well at least you had christmas with the whole family\" like he was trying to one up her, I wasn't having that. I told him our parents didn't abandon him, and he needs to understand that they were doing their best, and he's selfish for thinking he should have gotten more attention. Our parents want us to make up but I want an apology first.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was a child when you all send hima way to live with family.", "YTA.\n\nIn 3 years your family only saw him **once.** Sit down and really think about that, 3 years and only once. Your sister having cancer doesn't negate the fact that your brother was abandoned by your parents.\n\nHe was a 7 year old child. Your family shipped him off. It doesn't matter how hard it was for your parents. It was harder for him. He's traumatized. It was your parents' responsibility to care for ALL their children, not only the sick one. They abandoned him and only saw him *once* in 3 years. That's just cruel and cold-hearted.\n\nYou need to apologize to your brother for invalidating his feelings. I really hope your parents are paying for therapy bc your whole family needs it.", "YTA. \n\nYour family saw him *once* in three years? Three of his most formative years at that. That\u2019s truly pretty awful and yeah I would categorize that as abandonment. I\u2019m sorry your family went through that with your sister, but there is no way the solution should have been to ship your *seven year old* brother across the country and only see him once in three years. Awful. \n\nI hope that poor kid is in therapy. The least you can do is lend him some sympathy.", "Shameful behavior on your part in this regards. His parents Only seeing him once in those three years, he was abandoned, he is justified in the hurt he feels. It\u2019s a terrible situation all around but you need far more empathy for what your brother went though", "Yta\n\nSo he gets uprooted, loses contact with his friends, his family ships him off and then you belittle that? \nYou ,land your parents are assholes for doing that to him. Ofc he has abandonment issues, when that is exactly what happened. His parents and siblings cared so much about him, that they did not see him for years.... \n\nWhat do you think happens to a 7-year-old, who gets told by his mother and father: you are not worth my time\"? And they literally leave him at somebody else's doorstep. That is just garbagrle behavior from his family. \n\n\nWhat is your major malfunction, you unempathic toddler?", "YTA. He was abandoned for 3 years for all intents and purposes. If your sister\u2019s treatment lasted longer I\u2019m sure his stay would have too. And in that time you all only saw him once, but he should get over that?\n\nBy the way, he\u2019s still a child, unlike the rest of you. Family therapy should\u2019ve been a priority 4 years ago when he came home.", "YTA- what is it today with children being sent away due to illness in the family, and then when they come back their entire experience is dismissed as \"not that bad\" and \"get over it\" with a side of \"you really need to be more mature\".  Your brother was 7!  Do you remember being 7?  You are a child, and likely you wanted your parents.  Imagine for 3 years you saw your parents once.  No birthdays, no Christmas,  no Easter, nothing.  I am thinking you would be extremely upset and feel like you don't matter at all to your family.  Ever hear the phrase about being kind because everyone is fighting a battle?  Well here you go.  Your brother fought a battle every day to get up and feel like he mattered.  Like he was loved by his parents.  Then, magically he is again ripped away from his home and dropped in the middle of a family unit that has been together throughout this whole ordeal, getting closer I am sure, while he was across the country and nobody will even acknowledge that he had struggles and had it \"bad\" too.  Get the FUCK over yourself and apologize to your brother, you are an ASSHOLE", "YTA. Your parents did abandon him for 3 years. If you or your parents don\u2019t like the truth y\u2019all shouldn\u2019t of abandoned him.", "YTA, he was abandoned. Yes, your sister had it rough, but she had support, and it sounds like she still has support. What does he have? A family that dumped him and expects him to be grateful they let him live at home again? He needs therapy and support for y'all to admit it ducked for him. He didn't have a family Christmas, and yet you dump on him for being bitter for feeling as if he'd been thrown away. Sounds like he knows who counts, and it's not him.", "I hate to tell you, but your brother is never getting past this. It's only going to get worse. His feelings of abandonment are valid and should be taken that way. Hatred for a sick sibling is also very real. Without a ton of therapy, there will be no relationship with him for any of your family.", "YTA, he was, literally, abandoned for 3 years. I understand it was a horrible situation for everyone but thats just what happened.\nAlso he would absolutely not be the asshole for thinking he should have gotten more attention, one visit in 3 years is ridiculous even given the circumstances.", "Have you ever validated his feelings? It sounds to me like you're just told your brother to 'get over it' that 'it was rough on the entire family' but for a kid getting sent away from your parents for 3 years and only see them once must be super hard. Very easy to assume that he was not being prioritized which leads to anger and resentment. You're NTA for moving on now, but if you've never truly validated his abandonment concerns then you are TA.", "Yta, if it pisses you off then be a good sister,  show him you truly care about him, else he will forever know you as the b sister that abandoned him too", ">I told him our parents didn't abandon him\n\nI mean, the family saw him once in 3 years. He kind of was abandoned. Yes it was a horrible situation all round, but I get where he is coming from. Why couldn't he have stayed home and you help out with him? Was sending him across the country really the only solution? Your sister had treatable cancer and a support system. Your brother had no one besides your grandparents.\n\nAnswering your question, YTA for saying he wasn't abandoned and being selfish.", "YTA!! He was abandon.. that\u2019s a fact! U get your parents where going thru it but one of them should have stay at home and switch weekly.. that\u2019s what my parents did when my sister was diagnosed!! I understand your views won\u2019t be the same because you still got to see them unlike him.. he had no choice but to be away because at the time your parents though that was the best.. you need to back off him and actually listen and sympathize.", "YTA he was abandoned and suffered just like your sister", "YTA. You did abandon him, when he was 7. The rest of your family stayed together and sent him away and saw him ONCE in that 3 year period. Of course YTA", "YTA, your dismissing his feelings. He was abandoned in favor for your sister. For goodness sake, you did only see him once in the three years he was gone. You are selfish for not seeing his POV. You\u2019re an adult now, need to act like one.", "YTA- your parents did abandon him. As parents it is their responsability to take care of ALL the kids. Not ship one off because its easier for them. Im shocked your brother even talks to them at all.", "When my daughter had cancer at the age of 3 we were made aware of the detrimental affects it would have on our other child and our family for the rest of our lives. We were cautioned about the lifelong struggle the whole family would endure. Many resources were offered for all of us. There are support groups, summer camps, and college scholarships offered to siblings of children who have been treated for cancer. This happened to all of you, I encourage you to extend each other some grace, compassion, and support as you all heal.", "YTA. Your brother's feelings are 100% valid. He was dumped. His parents saw him ONCE in three years. That's absolutely despicable. I don't care how heartbroken your parents were frankly, they made that choice and they can deal with that as adults. Your brother, the child in the situation, deserved and continues to deserve better.\n\nNoone owes you an apology, get over yourself.", "Gently, YTA. You saw what was happening with your sister and your parents, you lived that terrible situation and you were sort of 'abandoned ' too. Things like this don't just affect the person who is sick, it messes up the whole family. If there's a villain here, it's the health care system that forces these situations. \n\nYour family is back together, but you're not whole. Your brother has every right to feel abandoned, and you have the right to feel it, too. My mom's family was dirt poor, and when my grandparents had yet another child they couldn't feed, they decided when he was a toddler to send him to family states away that could care for him. He never starved like his sisters, didn't watch as a brother died of fever in their living room, didn't wear rags to school. That generation is in their late 70's to 80's now.

You and your brother are going through the same thing. \n\nYou should try to get therapy for this. You went through a lot, and while the outcome was positive, this is leaving scars emotionally.

Your brother was abandoned.", "YTA. Two things can be true at the same time. Though it may have been for a good reason, he was abandoned and he is valid in his feelings.

There are lots LOTS of kids who end up jumping from group home to group home for years because for whatever reasoning their parents couldn't care for them for that time, your brother was in a VERY similar situation and he feels justified in saying abandoned. He may not 100% understand the reasoning or maybe he does but that isn't enough to justify the treatment he went through either way if he doesn't want this to effect every relationship he ever has he needs to go to therapy and come to terms with his abandonment issues, because brining them up and throwing then in the face of others isn't healthy and he's too young to see that and self correct. \n\nYour sister was incredibly sick and your parents did everything in their power to do what was best for her because she was the priority.

Just because parents were sad about sending him away doesn\u2019t mean that that wasn\u2019t still abandoning him and his feelings are still valid. Sure they were making sure his physical needs would be met but there\u2019s no way his emotional needs were being met when he didn\u2019t even see his parents really for 3 years. That still qualifies as abandonment, so technically he\u2019s right. Your sister suffered and that\u2019s horrible but it doesn\u2019t lessen the suffering your brother went through as a result. No he shouldn\u2019t be trying to \u201cone-up\u201d her with his suffering but I think it\u2019s more important to validate and address his suffering than to make sure hes being corrected and reprimanded for comparing the two. \nAlso people can suffer at the hands of others without there needing to be blame placed. He suffered at the hands of your parents sending him away but they were also doing the best they knew to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be neglected and unsafe at home.

I say this because it seems like you hold some defensiveness for your parents but I\u2019m just pointing out that him being upset with the unfairness of what happened doesn\u2019t mean your parents are at fault or anyone needs to be defensive for them. Being defensive for them can easily lead to invalidating his feelings since it\u2019s not needed. His feelings don\u2019t equate to saying your parents were wrong.", "YTA in this situation.

The choice was brutal but... A dead children is a children you can't even made peace with. It's better to have an alive children and make peace eventually. If it really comes down to these choices which were: putting the son in huge danger or sending him away.\n\nMy opinion would be different if it was a more bland parentification but... The eldest being basically the sole responsible (both parents always away) was recipe for a disaster. Sometimes disasters don't happen but it isn't stupid fearing them.

His feelings are valid and he was abandoned.\n\nI still think the parents, if the context is correct for it, sound like they did everything they could.", "Leaving your child and not involving them in their own family and seeing them once in 3 years is definitely abandonment and I put it in caplocks since you clearly don\u2019t get it.\nThey sacrificed that boys needs in favour of their other child.\nI\u2019m sorry but they are a 2 parent household they could of switched on and off who\u2019s at hospital and who\u2019s at home but they CHOSE not too.", "You repeating the same sentence ten times doesn't change the fact that his parents did abandon him.", "It is exactly abandonment. It might not be \"legal\" abandonment as recognized by laws, but it is 10000% emotional abandonment. The context might justify the narrative but it does not negate that he was abandoned. It may or may not be justified, that context doesn't change the indisputable fact that the parents were not providing emotional support for one of their children, let alone seeing them. That's abandonment.", "It isn't.", "In no way is her brother a massive asshole. They did abandon him for three years and literally only saw him once in that time. For a ten year old, that\u2019s a lot. He\u2019s not an asshole for being upset about it at all. It\u2019s actually pretty reasonable for him to be upset. \n\nThe only assholes here are OP and her parents for not putting them in therapy.", "Google \"glass children\".", "Yes. A child", "You\u2019re just a better and more empathic person than I am. The world needs more folks with your mind set.", "He was not abandoned.", "Yeah. But this is way above just AITA. They\u2019re all wounded and need help. I guess that was my main point. That they\u2019re all trying their best and bc they don\u2019t seem to have the tools they need to work through it, they\u2019re lashing out at each other. It\u2019s not something I think is fair to judge. That\u2019s mainly the reason I went with NAH.", "Except these parents aren't deadbeats, they couldn't afford it, according to the story.\n\nIt's objectively not abandonment, he went to life with grandparents, he wasn't taken out to the woods and left to fend for his own.\n\nAgain, his feelings of anger are valid, but he wasn't abandoned. He needs therapy.", "TIL redditors don't consider grandparents family.", "Okay.", "[removed]", "I swear it\u2019s like talking to a wall", "He wasn't abandoned...", "But the question isn\u2019t about OP\u2019s parents at all, it\u2019s about the OP saying that her brother wasn\u2019t abandoned and being upset with him for expressing his feelings about that. The whole family went through hell so it\u2019s an absolute AH move for the OP to tell her brother that he isn\u2019t allowed to feel negatively about the hellish time they all experienced.", "Disagreeing with you doesn't mean I don't understand something. That's a huge issue in this sub.\n\nHe wasn't abandoned. His frustration is valid. \"They could have switched off\" ironically you don't understand, OP cites money as an issue. \n\nOP says she understands this was rough for him. What you are failing to consider is the massive amounts of other context in this story. Both parents had to work longer hours. They had to downsize their space. It totally sucks that the brother had to move in with other family (read:not abandoned), but that was because he was so young and for no other reason.", "If one parent is in the hospital and the other one at home looking after the kids, who is working to get money to pay for the treatment ? OP stated that  the parents weren't rich.\n\nIt was never a matter of choosing for the parents other then to both work long and hard and raise money to save one child and abandon the other or looking after the youngest and let the oldest one die due to untreated cancer.\n\nAnd how tough the decision must have been  for them, I don't think they actually had a choice at all.", "Factually, it's still not abandonment.", "No, that isn't abandonment either. They may not had seen him more than once, and I'm not saying this wasn't hard on him, but we don't know if they called, video chatted, wrote letters etc. \n\nThe context here does justify the narrative, which is why I don't think OP is an AH, and the brother and family need therapy.", "He\u2019s an asshole for saying it when her sister is saying her health is better, implying she was better off even when she had fucking cancer the kid is lashing out at exactly the wrong person he\u2019s an asshole for doing that.", "Like I said the kid needs therapy and again my point is when someone says their health is improving not to be resentful of the person who was sick it\u2019s not their fault. As someone who was chronically sick you realize how it effects the whole family it makes you feel like shit, she doesn\u2019t need to be reminded that her cancer caused her siblings problems.", "He was thrown to his grandparents for 3 years, they visited him once in those 3 years, and than expect him to not be upset about it after they just threw him across the country to people he didnt even know at 7 years old", "In the traditional sense? No. But he was emotionally abandoned at a young age.", "He saw his parents once in three years. How is that not being abandoned? Especially through the eyes of a 7 year old child.", "Oh, I understand and are completely right that this is beyond a this subs pay grade. They all need help and I hope they can get it. I\u2019m not saying a giant Y T A, it\u2019s more like a N A H but slightly leaning on Y T A territory.", "They could have sent both of them away so at least he could have comfort, or have OP watch over the brother when needed to and let him stay. He was abandoned.", "Nowhere does it say that they sent him to live there because they couldn't afford to keep him. And just because he wasn't living alone doesn't mean he wasn't abandoned *by his parents*. He was absolutely abandoned *by his parents.*", "If he was 7 and they lived across the country? I bet that's the first time he ever met them", "I love my parents very much but they are NOT the same thing as me and my partner for our children. There is no replacement for a parent in the development of a child especially if they are being sent away from them at the age of 7 for 3 bloody years. It absolutely astounds me this even needs to be said. I hope most people in the bottom of the comments here don't have, and never have, any kids.", "And yet somehow I have never wanted to physically strike a family member. Look into anger management courses.", "Maybe not but it doesn\u2019t make the fact that they chose to abandon there son to save there daughter", "Care to explain how it isn\u2019t abandonment? Definition of abandon- cease to support or look after. Yes he had his grandparents but his parents didn\u2019t support him for three years. They had their reasoning but that\u2019s still abandonment", "Why do you think this child is not justified in feeling abandoned and what experience do you have with complex family situations and abandonment? Do children who are removed from their families for neglect get to feel abandoned, or are their feelings unjustified too because the state stepped in? \"Abandoned\" is a feeling that this child is experiencing because his parents sent him away and did not adequately check in on him. That's a valid experience, regardless of the context. OP is absolutely an asshole for prioritizing the feelings of his parents, adults who have obligations towards their children, over the actual child in this situation. He doesn't need to defend his parents, and that he is tells me that his parents feel the need to be defended because they aren't sure they did the right thing either. This was a lose-lose situation. No one came out better for it. They can acknowledge that their actions sucked, even if there wasn't a valid alternative, and validate the feelings of OP. My husband survived childhood cancer, his younger brother is the one who bears those scars long term. Context does not change the feelings that children experience and your insistence that people focus on the logistics instead of the emotions is the opposite of healing.", "No, he\u2019s not an asshole for that either. He was a seven year old who was dropped off with his grandparents for three years and they saw him ONCE. You cannot expect him to act rationally when his parents essentially dropped him off and abandoned him.", "It was not the sister's fault, but the brother is entitled to his feelings, and to express them and have them validated.   Sounds like the whole family needs therapy.   But getting therapy is not going mean the brother needs to suppress the bad thing that happened to him to spare other's feelings.  It sounds like that is what they have been trying to get him to do for 4 years.", "No one here, not even OP, is saying the brother shouldn't be hurt or upset. OP literally says she understands that what he went through was rough.", "No, he still wasn't. The post doesn't say they only communicated one time. He was also with grandparents, not abandoned in the woods and raised by wolves. \n\nAlso, you're leaving out all the context here.", "Because this post doesn't say they didn't communicate elsewhere. He also lived with other family, he wasn't in the woods howling at the moon with wolves. \n\nNot only that, context? I'm not sure what to think would have happened if he had stayed. He still wouldn't have seen them, as they had to work extra jobs to afford the treatment, and instead OP would have had to raise him when she was 13-14? How is that a better situation?", "Fair enough. Seems like we\u2019re both concerned for them and splitting hairs about the vote. Lol :)", "This is factually not abandonment. \n\nWho is to say that would have even comforted him? And can you listen to yourself please, if the brother was supposedly abandoned, you think the parents doing that to two children would be a better solution? They should \"abandon\" two kids?\n\nI don't know why the OP didn't watch him, but I think it was partially due to money, and partially due to her being 14. That would be parentification.\n\nWhat you all aren't really considering is that this is basically a no win situation for everyone involved, which is why I said NAH, and why they all need therapy.", "TIL Redditor's don't travel.", "Thanks Martha I will be sure to look into anger management classes. Please clutch your pearls more.", "Oh, i totally agree with you that the son was abandoned and that he has every right to feel that way. \n\nI was just responding to your \"CHOSE \" remark, like they did it out of convenience or such.", "Because you literally said it, he had his grandparents. He wasn't abandoned. He temporarily lived with grandparents (family) due to a really messed up situation.\n\nWe don't know if his parents called, texted etc. OP only mentioned they only flew to visit him once, OP did not say they were no contact.", "This post does not say he wasn't communicated with. The post says they only saw him in person once. That doesn't mean they didn't call, video call, write etc. \n\nI'm saying he wasn't literally abandoned, which he wasn't, but you're also putting words in my mouth. I didn't say he isn't allowed to feel upset, and I also did say he needs therapy. \n\nThis situation was clearly hard on the whole family, and that is what OP addressed. It wasn't like they randomly decided they didn't like him. If he was older, he possibly would have been allowed to stay. Money was clearly an issue, as both parents had to work multiple jobs. OP was only 14. \n\nThis was a no win scenario for the parents, and I think it was probably the most humane thing to do, sending him to live with other family. Instead of seeing his parents crying, if he would get to see them at all.", "Did they only see him because they didn\u2019t like him or was it because the financially couldn\u2019t, which seems to be the case it\u2019s fine for him to have these feelings about the parents and talking to them about it but going what about me when someone chronically sick says anything positive about their illness is just being spiteful. There\u2019s a time and a place for everything and it wasn\u2019t the time for him to it up. He\u2019s doing oppression Olympics with a cancer survivor it\u2019s a shitty thing to do. Both siblings have made their sisters illness about them they both suck.", "SHE WANTS HIM TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS FEELINGS ARE U SERIOUS RN??!!?!", "SHE WANTS HIM TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIM BEING UPSET HE WAS CAST ASIDE LIKE A USED TOY AND THAN ACT ALL HAPPY AND GIDDY THAT HE WAS ABANDONED, AND SHE HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE MAD AT HIM.", "Yes, I\u2019m aware that he was not left out in the woods. I literally said he wasn\u2019t abandoned in the \u201ctraditional\u201d sense. But he had to move across the country away from his home, friends and his close family. He saw them one time in 3 years, and considering how busy everyone was, communication was likely minimum. \n\nThe parents were stuck in a bad situation and had to make a hard call that I don\u2019t fault them for, but it doesn\u2019t change that the brother was emotionally abandoned. Op trying to tell the brother that he wasn\u2019t is somewhat AH territory.", "Yup. Pretty much.", "Op os invalidating his trauma. That's enough to make her the AH", "[deleted]", "But they did choose. I\u2019m not saying there other options were good or even feasible but at the end of the day they still made the choice to send one child away and only bother to visit him once.", "Let\u2019s say you put a baby in a basket and leave it at the fire department. Someone may eventually adopt it and raise it. But at the end of the day YOU abandoned that baby. He had his grandparents but his PARENTS abandoned him. Doesn\u2019t matter if they called. Not seeing the people who are supposed to raise you for three years because essentially you weren\u2019t high enough on their priority list is abandonment. The situation sucks and I don\u2019t think the parents were malicious but that does not completely absolve them either.", "Not for his feelings, she didn't say that? She wants an apology for what he said? She literally says she understands that what happened to him apologize because as she said \"he was trying to one up\" everyone else on their trauma.", "She said this situation sucked for him, so she isn't invalidating his feelings or acting like nothing bad happened to him. Telling him that this sucked for everyone isn't doing that. \n\nAs far as emotional abandonment, if you think they were too busy to call or text, how would that have been different for him if he stayed? It wouldn't have. Instead he stayed with two grandparents, who can provide emotional support, so I still think it's unfair to even remotely say he was abandoned. Yes, it sucked, but he wasn't alone in a room like he would have been if he had stayed. Or raised by his 14 year old sister.", "She absolutely did not do that, say says she knows it must have been rough. It's right there in the post. That isn't invalidating his feelings.", "Thanks boo boo! I don\u2019t know how I would have gotten through life if you hadn\u2019t told me! I can tell you are so much fun at parties. I\u2019m sure you pass your judgement onto people based on fleeting comments and then hold it over there head. As I said before you seem like a very insufferable human being. I could see why your family/\u201cfriends\u201d wouldn\u2019t invite you out", "Living with other family members temporarily isn't the same as leaving a kid at a fire station, or giving a kid up for adoption because you don't want it anymore.", "Ofc she understands, she was shipped off across the country to people she didnt know and wasnt called, texted, visited expect for once in those 3 years as a 7 year old child, and he should understand his parents not being able to help one kid and focus all their attention on his sister because obviously shes more important. He should understand that and suck it up because what his parents went through and his sister should overrule his feelings, very understandable.", "Not one of them had the gull to even visit him, stfu with that bullshit. They are all AH and u defending that bs makes me so mad, \u201cshe understands what he went through\u201d clearly since his sister is more important and her feelings matter more to the point he needs to apologize for his feelings, such a stuck up AH.", "He was. You can try and argue he wasn\u2019t, but he was. All because it doesn\u2019t fit the traditional perception of abandonment, doesn\u2019t make his experience of abandonment any less valid. He was separated from his core family unit at age 7, he likely was not close to the grand parents due to distance and age. It\u2019s not just the family but it\u2019s the living situation and social aspect. He had to leave everything that was familiar to him. \n\nIt would have sucked either way but being emotionally abandoned was worse. Op saying he wasn\u2019t abandoned and saying \u201cyeah, it sucked.\u201d Is minimizing at best, invalidating at worst.", "Man, I hit a sore spot."]}
