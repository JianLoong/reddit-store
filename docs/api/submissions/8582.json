However, she is currently on government benefits (as she is unemployed) and barely gets enough to fund her current lifestyle while living with my parents (occassionally having to ask them for additional money) - so why would I expect she would be able to afford anything when she moves out, on top of having to pay for rent.\n\nWhen I explained this to her, she got very upset at me, acting as if I have no choice in the matter and yells saying that I'm only doing this to her because she is disabled; she has a history of depression and other neurological issues which is why she isn't working right now.\n\nEven with government rent assistance, she would only be receiving at most an additional $75 a week which is barely anything.

You can't carry the needs of your sister at this time. That doesn't make you selfish in the least. It was up to your parents to prepare your sister for her time to leave home. With the disabilities she suffers from it almost sounds like she'd be better in an assisted living program where she can be somewhat supervised.", "NTA. Lifelong disabled woman here retired after a long career. I know of someone whose disabled sister refused to get a job and lived with her for over 10 years, not helping around the house or with rent/bills/groceries. She finally had to kick her out and force her to go back home and live with their mother again. It irks me to hear when someone uses their disability as an excuse to get out of finding a job. There is a ton of resources for disabled people to use in finding jobs, housing, accommodations, schooling, etc. so there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for your sister. Perhaps you can compile a list of these resources in your area and give that list to your sister. Stand your ground. Build that beautiful home and enjoy your freedom, guilt-free, footloose, and fancy-free. The very best of luck to you!", "NTA hope you stick to it,", "NTA. It sounds like she had planned to just go with you when you left, and now her plan won\u2019t work.  You have no duty to do this. She is perfectly safe and cared for where she is, and could have job opportunities if she worked in them.", "NTA. People have already said it but if you let her move in she\u2019ll never leave, it sounds like she\u2019ll never have the means to. It\u2019s an uncomfortable conversation to have now, but it\u2019s still 10x better than letting her move in and then needing to kick her out once she\u2019s over stayed her welcome. \n\nDo you plan on renting out any of the rooms or were you planning to live there alone? Either way this can form a basis of your reasoning with her. If you were going to rent out rooms though you could explain to her that you actually need that rental income to help the mortgage?", "NTA\n\nDo not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "NTA, even with mental health and neurological issues, she can still find a job that suits her. Stick to your guns or this will be your entire life.", "NTA, people with disabilities and mental health issues should be given extra help and consideration, in my opinion, but only if they are putting the effort in to be productive and get healthy.", "NTA - You shouldn't have to live with anyone you don't want including your sister. But your attitude to her is unkind.   \n\n\n> barely looks after her own health - I often have to remind her at times about scheduling medical appointments.\n\nYes, depression makes it almost impossible to look after your own health, she's struggling so much that she can't motivate herself to make the appointments she needs. Do not misinterpret this as me saying you should live with her. But your understanding of mental health sucks.", ">it's just an energy I don't want around me anymore.\n\nThen you need to tell her she can't move in with you.

That doesn't happen when the family moves with you. That is just moving house, not moving out. Where one family member comes, others then follow.", "NTA. Since you are moving out, maybe your sister could move to your room, or have two rooms available to her.\n\nHer moving in with you, is bringing the past and all of the problems with you. Until sister decides to look for work, she is stuck at home. There is no reason for you to subsidize her lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nGet out of there!\nSave yourself!", "NTA - Don't let her move in with you. When you eventually have to evict her, you will have permanently ruined your relationship.", "NTA, she isn't entitled to your property, you even offered a low rent, all she has to do is not being lazy, one thing is being disabled and another whole thing is not putting any effort, Nick Vujicic is a good example of that.", "NTA and stand firm. You don't want her to move in so don't let her. If she wanted to change she would have already and you know it.

Your sister won't change if she moves in with you. She'll do as she pleases because you can't tell her what to do while expecting you to subsidize her lifestyle. When her life doesn't magically change, she'll blame you because you didn't wave your magic wand to make everything better. Leave her at your parents house but do let them know that youre nit a housing option for sister fir when she can't live with them anymore.

Personally, I would retract that offer because even if she git a job, it would likely be short term before she quit.  Sounds like your sister has a lot of issues she needs to resolve herself. \n\nYou needs to concentrate on your change of environment, your life and your future and not take on the burden of someone who is not open to looking after her own health and welfare.  At some point you might have a partner and children, who you will need to put first. \n\nHoming your sister sounds like a bad decision that you would soon regret.", "NTA.\n\nI get the feeling that even if she did agree to pay rent that it would stop in a matter of weeks. The excuses would roll and you would have a heck of a time getting her out.\n\nDon't feel bad for doing what you need to do for you. Don't let her guilt you. Yes, it's a shame she suffers from mental health issues, but nothing will change unless she makes it.\n\nETA: Don't for any reason give her a key.", "Stand your ground. She clearly has no intentions of working to better herself and will end up making your life hell. People like her just want something for nothing. If she wants out that bad, she should get her life in a better place first.", "NTA. She can't work, but I guarantee you once she moves in, she'll become an expert in legal residency/eviction laws and will know how difficult it will be to kick her out.", "Exactly", "This is a really gross thing to say.

My wife suffers from fibromyalgia and has depression.

Of course it is up to OPs sister how she lives her life but OP does not have to accommodate it.", "No matter how you look at it, no one is coming to fix or help us in life. Either we get up and do it, or we don\u2019t.

While that merits me some flexibility, it doesn't absolve me of all responsibility for life \n\n  It sounds like ops sistsr is not doing ANYTHING to help herself.
