There is an ocean of difference between the two. While OP would be NTA for not letting her live with him for free either way, asking someone who is on disability to get a job isn't so simple because it is so hard to get benefits and they can cut them or take them away as soon as you get a job.

Little to none. Living with someone is a huge commitment and she should be more understanding as to why you wouldn't want to make that. Also wanted to say also the most likely reason she keeps saying she cannot get a job if she's on disability is because they take away any and all benefits, including insurance, which some jobs don't have or lack a lot of benefits for, and it's incredibly difficult to get back on it once you lose it if it turns out you really cannot work. Even attempting to apply is something they take as evidence that you Don't Need It. They look for Any excuse to take it away from you, even if it's a /physical/ disability. Much more so if it isn't.

Mental illness is a disability and it absolutely impacts your ability to gain and maintain work. I've struggled with it myself (was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 12 years ago and still struggle every day) and can absolutely see your sister's POV. When you're struggling with chronic depression, it may not look like you're struggling but some days just getting out of bed is a win. It comes with major fatigue, unexplained body pain, and problems with your executive functioning skills, and it is really debilitating. It's why I end up working and having to leave my jobs at my doctor's advice - it's too much sometimes and can cause relapses or for your condition to worsen. The attitude towards her disability is unfair, given the information you've provided.  \n\n\nThat being said, you don't owe her a space in your home. It's yours. Living with your parents may be difficult but it's not a good enough reason to feel she's entitled to a space in your house, and you're her sibling, not her carer.

It's too much.", "NTA If she is disabled does your country have disability benefits? She should apply if so.\n\nI can tell you that it isn't a good idea to become financially responsible for your sister. It is an extremely hard decision to reverse.

If at some point in the future you wanted her to move out, you would be the bad guy then.\n\nYou don't know if in future you will get married and have a family. Your future partner may not want to live with your sister, and your sister may never be independent and able to live on her own. It is up to her and her parents to help her become as independent as possible.\n\nLive your life, don't let her move in just because she wants to. Enjoy being young and single.

There are many options out there, right now you are the most convenient. Don't saddle yourself with responsibilities when you are just starting out.", "You are 100% not obligated to let your sister live with you, but, I say this gently, you are talking about her in a way that is a bit unkind. From the way you describe her situation, it sounds like she is right that moving out from her current living arrangement would be helpful to her. I can understand why she is putting pressure on you if she sees going with you as her only option. I can also understand why you wouldn't want to \\*be\\* her only option. That's a lot when you haven't voluntarily signed up for it!\n\nSo after wavering a bit I'm going with NAH even though I think you are light y - t - a in the way you're talking about your sister. Remember that struggling to deal with real medical problems is not a moral failing and doesn't make you a bad person.\n\nIf you live in the US, has she looked into vocational rehabilitation services? They help disabled people find employment. It sounds like she finds things overwhelming, and it can be with depression + other medical diagnoses. In my state, voc rehab doesn't require you to be approved for SSI/SSDI to be accepted for services. Those are very, very hard to get and many disabled people don't have them. But you can apply for vocational rehab services and submit evidence of disability just based on your medical diagnoses and have that be sufficient.\n\nMy suggestion would be to google \"vocational rehabilitation (where you live)\" and see if there is something available in your area for your sister to apply for. I'm afraid don't know what kinds of things are available outside the US at all if you don't live here, but maybe there is something!\n\nVocational rehab was a literal lifesaver for me when I became disabled and could no longer do my former career. I was really depressed, and being unemployed and so broke I couldn't pay rent made it a million times worse. Like your sister, I struggled to manage my multiple medical problems and had all but given up on applying for jobs because I just couldn't see a way to make it work. But they helped me sort myself out, figure out what kind of jobs I \\*could\\* still be successful at, and walked me through setting myself up to be successful in applying, etc. -- and now I have a full time job. I probably would have given up on a lot more than working if I hadn't gotten that help, if you know what I mean.\n\nI hope your sister can find something (whether it's voc rehab or something else) that helps her in a similar way. The weight doesn't have to be and shouldn't have to be all on you. You are right to protect your boundaries, but you don't have to be angry at your sister for needing help, because you really \\*aren't\\* the only source for it. There are other options out there.

And they're not arguing that anyone has to help anyone else. They've explicitly said that they think OP shouldn't help.\r\n\nThe issue is with the idea that disabled people should only be helped if they're putting in the effort to get better, when not all disabled people can do that. Some disabled people are permanently disabled. They will never get better because they can't. They are still deserving of help. And that does not mean that you are obligated to help them. If you can't or don't want to that is 100% fine. But when you make the blanket statement of\r\n\n>people with disabilities and mental health issues should be given extra help and consideration, in my opinion, but only if they are putting the effort in to be productive and get healthy.\n\nyou're saying that an entire group of disabled people *should not* be given help due to something out of their control. And that's very different from saying \"only help them if you can and want to,\" or some other more reasonable condition that doesn't basically come down to \"if they're never going to get better, don't bother.\"", "Yes, I said that she seems to have no motivation to help herself and build the life she wants OP to fund. In what way am I saying people with depression just need to try harder? What she needs to do is work on herself. While depression makes this harder, it doesn\u2019t make it impossible and not doing anything about it is no one\u2019s responsibility but hers. At some point it stops being an excuse. \n\nAgain, I literally never said all disabled people should, I said very clearly that you giving her a pass just because she has a disability is offensive. Maybe her disability means she can\u2019t work (though if it\u2019s depression and she is not actively seeking help then only she can take responsibility for that) or maybe it doesn\u2019t. You giving a free pass to do nothing with her life because she had a disability you know nothing about very much makes it seem like you think having a disability means people cant, and shouldn\u2019t be expected to work. Again, it\u2019s infantalising and patronising. \n\nAnd fuck off with your ableist bullshit. I have a disability that would 100% qualify me for government funding so I wouldn\u2019t have to work. You know what I did today? I worked 14 hours. Just like I did yesterday. I\u2019m fully capable. Having a disability and qualifying for government funding does not mean you cannot contribute to society, be that by having a job or one of many ways to be part of the world.
