Really really hard. And in a climate where thousands get denied, your sister managed to be disabled enough to get (minimal) assistance. Struggling with everyday function is a part of many disabilities, and if she doesn\u2019t want to lose her safety net, she cannot get a job (which she, by the sound of it, could not keep).\n\nThis really sucks for her. She doesn\u2019t need a brother to trash talk her to the Internet on top of that.", ">However, she is currently on government benefits (as she is unemployed) and barely gets enough to fund her current lifestyle\n\nExactly. I'm also wondering what type of benefits she gets. Is it unemployment (because she's unemployed and self-proclaimed 'disabled') or is it disability (because her trained team of medical professionals have determined that she is disabled and therefore unable to work)? There is an ocean of difference between the two. While OP would be NTA for not letting her live with him for free either way, asking someone who is on disability to get a job isn't so simple because it is so hard to get benefits and they can cut them or take them away as soon as you get a job. Which is especially dangerous if it turns out that they can't sustain the job because of their disabilities.", "NTA\n\nYou're not leaving her homeless. She's jealous, but if she really wants to move on, she needs to look at what would be a sustainable lifestyle for her.  \n\nEven if she were to find a job, you have no guarantee that she would maintain it.  Once she's living in your house, depending on where you live, it may turn into a legal situation and get really ugly.  \n\nThis is a case where you should be taking care of yourself.   You've worked to earn your independence, and so you should enjoy it.", "Exactly this OP.", "Don\u2019t let her move in even if she dies find a job. She can want what she wants. But so can you.", "Yes. This is much more nicely phrased than mine, which was:  you\u2019re moving out to get away from this situation; why would you want to bring it with you?\n\n\nAnd in general, it is better to just say no and don\u2019t give reasons that can then be nitpicked.", "Do you plan on renting out any of the rooms or were you planning to live there alone?", "Yes, if she's  on disability,  she is very limited in how much extra income she can earn before losing her benefits.", "Disabilities and mental health issues are not people\u2019s fault, but they are that individual\u2019s personal responsibility to do what they can to help themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if the person struggling is working with health professionals and/or taking medication and they\u2019re still struggling- they\u2019re doing their best and they can\u2019t be faulted for that. What\u2019s not ok to just shrug your shoulders and say \u201cI have depression, so I can\u2019t do anything\u201d, refuse any sort of treatment, and expect other people to give you whatever you demand. \n\nNobody is looking for them to magically get better, just that they are making an effort in the treatment and management of their condition instead of expecting others around them to do that *for* them.", "You're 100% right and you don't deserve these downvotes. Getting better is a ridiculous amount of work, especially when you have no energy to begin with, and for some people it takes more energy than they have.", "No, you explained yourself just fine. Your wife's situation is not relevant to everyone. And shaming the people who are severely unwell, and can't manage basic tasks is cruel, they feel enough shame.\n\nNo one said OP has to accommodate, I literally don't think she should. But you don't have to shit on people who can't make the effort that you deem makes them worthy of special consideration.", "That's nice for you that you can. So how about you don't shit on others who can't?", "People always had adhd, it just wasn't often diagnosed before.. but sure, use this as a springboard for your narrow-minded boomer views.", "If she can't legitlly do anything for herself, she needs intensive medical assistance, which it seems she has access to.\n  \nI did nothing for a year when my depression was unmanaged.   That was a wasted year and changed the course of my life. I wish I got assistance sooner"]}
