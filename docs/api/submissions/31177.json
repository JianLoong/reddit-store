During these times, our family must stop what we\u2019re doing for the 15-20 minutes (though it\u2019s probably been more sometimes, I haven\u2019t actually timed it) to take photos of her, encourage her, tell her she looks good, etc. This would probably be find occasionally. I\u2019ve also had times on vacation where I\u2019ve asked her take pictures of me but I try to be considerate of time, snap a few photos, and then move on. But for her to be asking this multiple times a day on vacation honestly interferes with my relaxation and enjoyment. \n\nBefore, I would just go with it, take the pics and then ask her to do the same for me, thinking I\u2019d probably be happy to have the memories later on. However, I noticed she gets sour if I take more than a few minutes on my pics and will often ask to re do hers in the poses I was using or even get upset that I didn\u2019t suggest those same poses for her. Other times she hates the pictures I have taken of her and accuses me of purposely taking bad pictures because I\u2019m jealous. It honestly really brings my mood down and is stressful. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve started just saying that I don\u2019t want to take pictures and my mom will take them for her instead. This makes her upset because she says my mom is not as good at taking pictures and she would prefer that I do it. When I continue to refuse, she will say that I\u2019m jealous and being uppity about her social media usage. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m refusing because I\u2019m jealous or uppity, I just honestly don\u2019t get very much enjoyment out of the process with her.

Or adjust her expectations to be more realistic and be nicer to everyone involved. Either way. Basically, I said I\u2019ve done this for long enough and I won\u2019t continue to and now I\u2019m getting called the ahole for making our family vacations awkward because she throws up a fuss and gets in a mood when I refuse.

If taking pictures of your sister stresses you out and don't enjoy it, then don't do it.", "NTA. Your sister's behavior is totally unreasonable and it's not fair for her to expect you to act as her personal photographer on vacation. It's your vacation too and you have the right to enjoy it without feeling pressured to constantly take photos. She should be more considerate of your time and feelings.", "NTA. \n \nYour sister is a Brat and you\u2019re parents are enabling her. \nStick to your guns, you are not her slave/unpaid photographer", "NTA. Buy her a selfie stick for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nShe's using you as free labor.", "NTA, she's the one being selfish and kicking up a fuss.

NTA.\n\nYour sister is a want-to-be influencer. This type of narcassistic need for attention is exhausting. \n\nTell her your limit is one single 10 minute photo shoot per day. That is it. It dosn't come with encouragement and if that is what she needs she needs to hire a photographer.\n\nWhy are you being called an AH for refusing to take more photos when she is not being called out for her antagonistic temper tantrums. When she tantrums tell her that she looks incredibly ugly when she makes that face and the attitude just makes her uglier. Make her tantrums about her looks. Make her attitude about her looks.
