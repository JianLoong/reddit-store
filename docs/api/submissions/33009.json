We had a very toxic relationship, she had cheated multiple times, the occasion that did it for me was when she slept with my sister. Now she is in a straight relationship and is now 5 months pregnant, she has asked me on several occasions to help her buy things for the baby, to which I have given her $25 and $30 here and there for the last 3 months, I have told her before that I can\u2019t give her too much as I still need to buy food and other essentials for myself. A couple days ago she asked me if I could give her $150 to pay for a stroller, car seat & more clothes for the baby, to which I told her \u201cNo I can\u2019t afford it, I need to buy myself food and essentials\u201d she told me that she would pay me back in a few months, after she has given birth. I told her that was unacceptable and that \u201cit is not my responsibility to pay for YOUR child\u201d. She called later that day screaming at me, calling me an asshole, my phone hasn\u2019t stopped going off, her friends and family have been calling and texting me non-stop, saying that it\u2019s \u201conly money\u201d and that I HAVE to help her.
