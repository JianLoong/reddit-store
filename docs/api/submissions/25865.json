Sounds like parentification to me. Your only option with egoistic parents is to move out as soon as you can and go low contact. \n\nYou should not be a parent to your siblings, and you should not be an unpaid babysitter for your parents either.

Your parents are using the classic long distance tools of emotional manipulation- FOG. Fear, obligation and guilt are used to pressure you into doing what you don't want.

Your priorities should be gaining the skills you need to be an independent fully functional adult. \n\nYOU do not have children. If you did, your duty to provide care and supervision would be a priority. As it is, your parents have abdicated a share of their responsibilities for your siblings onto you to the degree that they don't recognize they're usurping your time and energy. They only notice the demand on THEIR time and energy when you aren't there to carry their load for them. Their failure to plan for childcare despite months of notice shows a disturbing lack of interest and attention to you as their child as well as to their responsibilities they've abdicated to you. It sounds as if they pay little attention to you as a person, seeing only your role in making their lives easier.", "Oh, gee, the teenager wasn't being responsible so that the adults didn't have to be!\n\nBoo-hoo-hoo!\n\nNTA OP.\n\nI hope you had a great time.

Felt pretty good to not to have to parent a bunch of kids for a whole week, didn\u2019t it?  As it should, since you\u2019re only 19 years old and these aren\u2019t your kids.  So I highly suggest you work towards making that a more long-term thing for yourself, and find a job and roommate situation that\u2019ll enable you to move out.\n\nAnd yeah, your parents are probably going to be pretty upset when you leave.

Never was.\n\nAnd they might cry about how much they *depend* on you and how much the kids *need* you.   Well, again, that\u2019s not your problem either.  That they\u2019ve allowed themselves to grow dependent on you doing their parenting for them is *their* failing to overcome, not something you have to compensate for.  And it would actually be really good for the kids to see you as their sibling and their parents as their parents for a change.  That that dynamic has been unhealthy and screwed up for a long time doesn\u2019t justify keeping it that way.  \n\nSo start thinking through move out plans.  And watch the old movie \u201cthree men and a baby.\u201d  There\u2019s a scene where one of them calls their mom and basically begs her to just take over the parenting and do it all for them, and she says something like \u201cthe best thing I can do for you is nothing.

I understand there may be a difference in cultures but your parents decided to have children. They need to be adults and care for them. It sounds like there is a strong possibility of parentification happening here. With both you and your brother. The fact that you felt the need to be assured of the younger siblings knowledge and comfort of your absence is a parental emotion. My mother did the same thing a similar thing. I'd say no and she'd still drop my youngest sister off. I kept her because I felt responsible to care for her. My relationship with her has always been closer to the one I have with my children than the one I should have with a sibling. Your brother being responsible for getting the younger siblings ready for summer camp and other events is also concerning. Helping is fine.
