You told them when you would be unavailable and they didn't do anything about it.", "NTA. Your siblings are your parents' responsibility, not yours. What's more you gave them ample notice that they acknowledged.\n\nThem forgetting an agreement they made does not make you irresponsible.

Sounds like parentification to me. Your only option with egoistic parents is to move out as soon as you can and go low contact. \n\nYou should not be a parent to your siblings, and you should not be an unpaid babysitter for your parents either. You should have been a child yourself, with lots of me-time, not raising your parents other kids.", "NTA. You asked them initially but did you remind them?

They have the responsibility for taking care of them and forgetting you wouldn't be there and not figuring anything else out was a massive failure.

It'll be ok\" Then walk away.", "She's not a child, she's 19, legally adult and ready to move out and live her own life. That she even asked permission is more a courtesy than a requirement. A notification that she'd be away during that time would have been plenty. It's great that she's still around to help her parents, but she won't be forever, and her parents should plan for that.\n\nInstead they're taking her for granted and piling the responsibility for their kids on her. That's is incredibly wrong.", "And why do BOTH parents have to do the shopping? Why can't one shop and the other stay with the kids? Oh right, shopping and childcare are women's work so the father is exempt from both, but has to go along with mom or he might have to pay attention to a kid. \n\nDear OP, please move out ASAP!", "NTA\n\nGood on you for taking your trip as planned. Your parents are using the classic long distance tools of emotional manipulation- FOG. Fear, obligation and guilt are used to pressure you into doing what you don't want. In this case, being their live in babysitter and house manager. Now is the time for you to focus on establishing your adult identity and lifestyle. Your priorities should be gaining the skills you need to be an independent fully functional adult. \n\nYOU do not have children. If you did, your duty to provide care and supervision would be a priority. As it is, your parents have abdicated a share of their responsibilities for your siblings onto you to the degree that they don't recognize they're usurping your time and energy. They only notice the demand on THEIR time and energy when you aren't there to carry their load for them. Their failure to plan for childcare despite months of notice shows a disturbing lack of interest and attention to you as their child as well as to their responsibilities they've abdicated to you. It sounds as if they pay little attention to you as a person, seeing only your role in making their lives easier.", "Oh, gee, the teenager wasn't being responsible so that the adults didn't have to be!\n\nBoo-hoo-hoo!\n\nNTA OP.\n\nI hope you had a great time.  You should do it more often.", "Nta you are not those kids parents.

No idea, do they have any history of trying to break your plan?", "NTA. \n\nYou gave them two months notice and received their permission to go on the trip even though you don't need it at 19.
