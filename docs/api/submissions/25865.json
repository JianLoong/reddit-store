Never blame yourself or let your parents blame you for siblings not having childcare (or anything else). It is not your responsibility to help raise your siblings.", "NTA, and that's some grade A entitlement right there on your parent's part. You have been TOO good at helping out and they have become complacent with the status quo. They forgot that once you became an adult, you were going to make an adult life for yourself because that's what kids are supposed to do.

They are the ones who forgot about caring for their own (multiple) children! Live your own life and let your parents deal with their reproductive choices.

End of story. Older children are NOT free childcare. When you can, I would be moving out of there if you ever want to have a life that doesn\u2019t involve being a free, live-in nanny.", "NTA! You did your due diligence. They spaced. It was thoughtful of you to NOT wake them at 4:00am.", "NTA their kids are their responsibility, not yours. You told them when you would be unavailable and they didn't do anything about it.", "NTA. Your siblings are your parents' responsibility, not yours. What's more you gave them ample notice that they acknowledged.\n\nThem forgetting an agreement they made does not make you irresponsible. They are irresponsible and they sound like pretty terrible parents and people in general for deflecting that on to you.", "NTA - Your parents are fucking terrible people.", "NTA. Sounds like parentification to me. Your only option with egoistic parents is to move out as soon as you can and go low contact. \n\nYou should not be a parent to your siblings, and you should not be an unpaid babysitter for your parents either. You should have been a child yourself, with lots of me-time, not raising your parents other kids.", "NTA. You asked them initially but did you remind them? Oh, wait...was the calendar on the outside of your door? Also, the children are their responsibility. I'd leave as soon as you can. Prepare your next oldest sibling and let him know his rights.", "NTA. Those are their kids. They have the responsibility for taking care of them and forgetting you wouldn't be there and not figuring anything else out was a massive failure. Normal parents don't forget things like that.", "NTA. They are unhinged. Just pat their had and say \"yes Dearie, i understand. It'll be ok\" Then walk away.", "She's not a child, she's 19, legally adult and ready to move out and live her own life. That she even asked permission is more a courtesy than a requirement. A notification that she'd be away during that time would have been plenty. It's great that she's still around to help her parents, but she won't be forever, and her parents should plan for that.\n\nInstead they're taking her for granted and piling the responsibility for their kids on her. That's is incredibly wrong.", "And why do BOTH parents have to do the shopping? Why can't one shop and the other stay with the kids? Oh right, shopping and childcare are women's work so the father is exempt from both, but has to go along with mom or he might have to pay attention to a kid. \n\nDear OP, please move out ASAP!", "NTA\n\nGood on you for taking your trip as planned. Your parents are using the classic long distance tools of emotional manipulation- FOG. Fear, obligation and guilt are used to pressure you into doing what you don't want. In this case, being their live in babysitter and house manager. Now is the time for you to focus on establishing your adult identity and lifestyle. Your priorities should be gaining the skills you need to be an independent fully functional adult. \n\nYOU do not have children. If you did, your duty to provide care and supervision would be a priority. As it is, your parents have abdicated a share of their responsibilities for your siblings onto you to the degree that they don't recognize they're usurping your time and energy. They only notice the demand on THEIR time and energy when you aren't there to carry their load for them. Their failure to plan for childcare despite months of notice shows a disturbing lack of interest and attention to you as their child as well as to their responsibilities they've abdicated to you. It sounds as if they pay little attention to you as a person, seeing only your role in making their lives easier.", "Oh, gee, the teenager wasn't being responsible so that the adults didn't have to be!\n\nBoo-hoo-hoo!\n\nNTA OP.\n\nI hope you had a great time.  You should do it more often.", "Nta you are not those kids parents. Your parents need to step up and be responsible for their own children.\n\nIt's not your fault that they \"forgot\" to get a sitter. They had more than enough notice to get it together.\n\nWhat do you mean your 13 year old isn't ready to be left alone to watch the kids? But weren't you made to watch the kids when you were much younger?  \n\nYou need to realize non of your siblings or you should be taking care of any siblings. This is your parents job. They should be the ones dropping them off at summer camp or dropping them off at school helping with homework ect. \n\nWill your parents still expect you to parent all their kids even when your married and have kids of your own? Your nta here you deserve to go out and enjoy yourself.", "INFO \u201coldest brother is almost 13 but he isn\u2019t ready to leave alone\u201d how old where you when you started stepping in to care for your siblings? I\u2019d wager it was younger than 13 right", "You asked them permission? You\u2019re an adult and are not responsible for their kids.

Now make it permanent", "Nta you didn't leave them in a lurch.  You aren't your siblings parent.  Move out as soon as you can.", "NTA, what's really sad is you had the calendar on your door for months and have been talking about it for two weeks beforehand. They are so far removed from their child they didn't really hear you for weeks? \n\nYou're just starting out, they need to take responsibility for their children and let you grow up and become your own person. \n\nTake more trips and focus on making yourself happy now, you've done more than enough!", "NTA none of this is your problem, and as an adult, you don't need their permission. They are the parents, they chose to have kids, and those kids are their responsibility. You don't exist as free childcare.", "NTA. A lack of planning on their part doesn't constitute an emergency for you.", "NTA, tell your parents to raise and patent their own children. Move, it will not get better until you do. Do it while they can't force the job on the next oldest. Your parents need to figure it out.", "NTA and why the hell would you need PERMISSION AT 19 to leave the house?\n\nThey made the kids, they can watch them", "NTA, you shouldn't be doing the childcare anyway, but you told them (you shouldn't be asking, you let them know when you will be gone), after that, it is their responsibility, not yours.", "NTA but you wrote that wrong. Your PARENTS were IRRESPONSIBLE with THEIR children and didn't arrange proper child care.\nParentification is a form of child abuse, seems that's not the only form of questionable parenting practices your parents engage in.", "NTA. They were the irresponsible ones, not you", "NTA. You didn't leave them in the lurch. They left themselves. You should have told them bye though.", "NTA. You had a freaking countdown on your door. This phrase is useful in many areas of life: \"your lack of planning is not my emergency\". You shouldn't feel even the tiniest bit bad.\n\nI hope you had a great trip. (And that, if it's what you wanted, you got some).", "You (the 19 year old) are irresponsible?\n\nThen what does that make them, the parents ?\nPathetic that\u2019s what", "NTA- childcare is NOT your responsibility it\u2019s theirs.", "NTA and they are the parents. Period. They need to be acting like it.", "NTA. I totally get the position you\u2019re in, and it\u2019s a really difficult one.
