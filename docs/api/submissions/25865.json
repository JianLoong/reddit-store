Never blame yourself or let your parents blame you for siblings not having childcare (or anything else). It is not your responsibility to help raise your siblings.", "NTA, and that's some grade A entitlement right there on your parent's part. You have been TOO good at helping out and they have become complacent with the status quo. They forgot that once you became an adult, you were going to make an adult life for yourself because that's what kids are supposed to do. I hope you have plans to leave their house soon- you might want to start being less available to get them ready for when you do.", "NTA.

Not yours.", "NTA. The only irresponsible people in your story are your dumbass parents who are so accustomed to using you as a third parent they now feel you owe them your valuable time and labour. They are the ones who forgot about caring for their own (multiple) children! Live your own life and let your parents deal with their reproductive choices. You have already \"contributed to the family\" throughout your entire childhood.

End of story. Older children are NOT free childcare. When you can, I would be moving out of there if you ever want to have a life that doesn\u2019t involve being a free, live-in nanny.", "NTA! You did your due diligence. They spaced. It was thoughtful of you to NOT wake them at 4:00am.", "NTA their kids are their responsibility, not yours. You told them when you would be unavailable and they didn't do anything about it.", "NTA. Your siblings are your parents' responsibility, not yours.

They are irresponsible and they sound like pretty terrible parents and people in general for deflecting that on to you.", "NTA - Your parents are fucking terrible people.", "NTA. Sounds like parentification to me. Your only option with egoistic parents is to move out as soon as you can and go low contact. \n\nYou should not be a parent to your siblings, and you should not be an unpaid babysitter for your parents either. You should have been a child yourself, with lots of me-time, not raising your parents other kids.", "NTA. You asked them initially but did you remind them? Oh, wait...was the calendar on the outside of your door? Also, the children are their responsibility. I'd leave as soon as you can. Prepare your next oldest sibling and let him know his rights.", "NTA. Those are their kids. They have the responsibility for taking care of them and forgetting you wouldn't be there and not figuring anything else out was a massive failure.

It'll be ok\" Then walk away.", "She's not a child, she's 19, legally adult and ready to move out and live her own life. That she even asked permission is more a courtesy than a requirement. A notification that she'd be away during that time would have been plenty. It's great that she's still around to help her parents, but she won't be forever, and her parents should plan for that.\n\nInstead they're taking her for granted and piling the responsibility for their kids on her. That's is incredibly wrong.", "And why do BOTH parents have to do the shopping? Why can't one shop and the other stay with the kids? Oh right, shopping and childcare are women's work so the father is exempt from both, but has to go along with mom or he might have to pay attention to a kid. \n\nDear OP, please move out ASAP!"]}
