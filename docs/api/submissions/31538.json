About the mouth open thing in plenty of cultures it is rude to do even slightly. You probably should not have bought up his military position. But depending from your perspective there may be culture differences and I do think he was maybe a bit harsh towards you. Best thing is to have a discussion with your girlfriend and maybe you both apologize, you for starting the arguement and him for being rude to you. But he needs to apologise too.
