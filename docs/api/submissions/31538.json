Best thing is to have a discussion with your girlfriend and maybe you both apologize, you for starting the arguement and him for being rude to you. But he needs to apologise too.

Lol", "But some people cannot and don\u2019t deserve to be treated as if they are committing an atrocity by eating.", "You can't guess from looking at me that I have issues, just as much as the girlfriends dad couldn't have seen whether OP had any issues or not before passing judgement. \n\nPeople shouldn't have to declare their (invisible) medical issues for the world to see just to be accepted... the world should be more kind and accepting.", "It does allow you to explain yourself and politely ask for accommodation though.  It doesn't give permission for the father's behavior.", "Good for you.", "Excuses, I wouldn't call a guest out for being late, chewing with mouth open and being lazy. Certainly would make a bad first impression though. Chewing with your mouth closed is very basic etiquette.", "I need to know why they consider apricot trees to be bad luck!", "To carry it around to recycle the air he's wasting when he talks or something like that is my guess", "Did this to my neighbor who is *so* nice to me now. He went from not speaking to me for *seven years* to smiling and waving and saying hi every time we pass. \n\nI have zero respect for people like that, they're so easy to manipulate and their anger is so predictable. It makes me instantly dislike them. \n\nAnd now I have the upper hand, because I was able to manipulate him into giving me deference, so it's a lose/lose for him. Lol", "Now that\u2019s a boot thing to say. Ogden don\u2019t give a shit what branch or MOS you were/are.", "Old school nurses are military like. Modern nursing was born out of war after all", "Calling people out for things like this is far worse etiquette than being 10 minutes late or chewing with your mouth open.", "When you\u2019re dealing with an AH like the GFs dad, yea there is such a thing. Dude was probably chewing just fine, but the guy was on a power trip and needed something to nitpick OP over. Good job feeding into that. NTA", "Yeah he obviously didn\u2019t master the skill of teleporting food from the fork into his closed mouth like Captain Cock learned while in boot camp.", "So. I actually have to open my mouth to fit food into it so that's bullshit right there.", "Unless you are literally seeing your lips together while you're eating, your mouth is going to open.\n\nNeed a sip of your drink to help swallow? Gotta open it.", "Thanks for your service and I hope you have a happy turkey day \ud83e\udd83", "Yeah, that cultural difference is being the US Army lmfao", "The point of meeting the parents is to introduce 2 groups of people that add value to your life. OP's girlfriend obviously likes and cares for OP or she wouldn't be introducing him to the parents. Of course parents are going to ask about you at these meet ups and that is entirely reasonable, but there is a big difference between asking questions and interrogating and judging.\n\nI mean it started instantly. Yes, OP was late, but everyone reasonable understands that happens sometimes and doesn't make a big deal out of it if it isn't a habit. Dad went straight to \"I have raised my daughters to be strict with timings, and you apparently are not\". He started the interaction on a combative footing.\n\nThe dad then went on to explicitly judge every aspect of OP's life. I don't invite people into my home to question their life decisions and imply that they aren't good enough. If that is how you normally treat your guests, I don't know what to say to you.\n\nLong story short, the dad is allowed to think OP isn't good enough for his daughter, but as soon as he expresses that publicly he is an asshole. He is basically saying that he knows better than his daughter who will be a benefit to her life. He isn't just insulting the OP, he is insulting and infantilizing his own daughter.\n\nSmall edit: \n\n>If you have shitty behavior, expect people to call you out on it.\n\nThis is a hilariously ironic statement when you are defending the father and saying that OP acted poorly. What do you think OP was doing when he confronted the father for being judgmental and rude?", "I'm sure he's *super* kind about your catboy status \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "No the worst part is if they're eating something chewy that makes a lot of squishing noise like soft candies", "That was the most disgusting eating I had ever seen.", "Right", "Open mouth chewing is gross, but the dad sounds like an abusive control freak.  I won\u2019t put all army vets in this category, but some of them use it as an excuse to be a jerk.  Sounds like the dad has some possessiveness over his daughter, so no matter what the OP does, he will not win.  I mean this is the first time meeting the op and he is already behaving this way.", "OP admitted chewing with his mouth open.", "Shit happens but you can still plan ahead and give yourself extra time for it potentially happening. Being late for a normal parent fist meeting isn\u2019t great, why set yourself up for absolute failure of you already know the parent is a strict veteran?", "Yes. Being avoidably late is rude. Is it dressing down rude, no. But it is obnoxious.", "An ESH situation. Dad was definitely an AH but who is 10 minutes late when meeting their SO's parents and doesn't call/text to let them know?", "It does affect me.\n\nIt's why I avoid being around anyone while eating. I can't be looked at or look at.", "It could just be that the dad is an AH and OP was chewing just fine but maybe slightly opened his mouth enough for the dad to nitpick at.", "You can ask the person if they are able to do it and explain why you\u2019d need this, but many people are not able to eat with their mouths closed and shouldn\u2019t be shamed for it.", "Exactly. In my case a bit of masking noise like music can solve the problem. Assuming someone is incapable of eating or drinking quietly for some reason. \n\nBut the father is just finding excuses to be critical for the sake of it. I suspect he's one of those men who will never approve of a daughter's partner, whoever they are. Or he's just a general grouch.", "What is a Chevron?", "So you're telling me you've never once chewed with your mouth open even just a little? And op said it wasn't even enough to be a big deal. Like I said, they could have been eating something that's hard to eat and not everyone has a great jaw in order to chew it correctly. I'm just trying to see it from different angles. I know ppl who have jaw/teeth problems that makes it hard for them to eat certain foods. Obviously if he was sitting there smacking his food with his mouth wide open then ya that would be gross, but he said that wasn't what happened.", "Thank you for explaining because I never in a million years would have guessed that lmao", "Would your husband have let his father speak to you like that?", "No they aren\u2019t. lol I\u2019m an old nurse.", "Lol, no, it's not. \n\nSo you're saying if someone farts/burps loudly at the table, bringing up how rude that was is worse than actually doing it?", "Eh... OP even admitted to chewing with his mouth open. I don't think the father is the AH for calling him out on that particular thing. Also calling him out for being late, too, since OP admitted to being late.", "Thats 100% true and open mouth chewing is reprehensibly disgusting. Maybe I have misphonia or something but its literally one of the worst things listen to.", "[removed]", "you don't put more food in your mouth when you're chewing. If such basic manner is so hard to adhere i suggest you go live with the animals instead.", "Swallow what\u2019s in there first and that\u2019s gonna solve the chewing with your mouth open part. Then you\u2019re mouth is only open when you\u2019re taking a new bite.", "You don't fit food when chewing. You finish chewing then you take a bite. Can't believe i need to teach someone how to chew on the internet ffs", "you can chew while your lips are together. And its generaly also considred a bad mannered when to drink while still had a food inside your mouth. Unless your food is stuck in your throat then you shouldn't drink while chewing.", "Appreciated, my friend. Same to you and yours!", "Misophonia sucks. I feel extreme anger at the sound of people eating. I can\u2019t eat chips because I can\u2019t stand the sound of my own chewing.", "If you absolutely must open your mouth because the bite you took was too big or the food too hot, you cover your mouth with your hand.", "What is the sound of one jaw chewing?", "In my experience, the more insecure they are about their service, the speed of which they tell you they are a vet increases. \n(I'm a vet that works part time in the service industry.)", "Being intentionally late is rude, sure. If your late due to traffic or something out of your power it is not. Its weird to shame someone for that. Especially for a dinner. I highly doubt if its a dinner that isn\u2019t a reservation at a restaurant. I highly doubt the family was sitting around the table awaiting OP to step through the door to dig in.", "10 minutes late is not rude.", "Probably but OP was never going to be good enough for daddy's little girl.", "Miserable fucks arre going to miserable fuck regardless of what anyone around them does.", "It\u2019s the name of the little up arrows that signify rank. Each one is a chevron. More chevrons means more rank. Sometimes people call them bars.", "Well of course OP said it wasn\u2019t enough to be a big deal. He was the one doing it.", "I'm especially careful to follow basic etiquette when meeting someone important for the first time. Also when I'm a guest in someone's home. If you need to take small bites. I don't make the societal rules, but I follow them", "Yes. It is good etiquette to be gracious when someone else makes a mistake, it is rude to chastise them in public for it. You\u2019ve never heard anyone say \u201cmind *your own* manners\u201d?", "If it helps, no one gives a shit about whelming you.", "Yours lips are not going to form air airtight seal the entire time you chew \ud83d\udc80\n\nLook out everyone we have the manners minister over here", "my nose is stuffy, I can't breathe!!!!! arghhgh", "I have dentures so I can\u2019t take as big of a bite anymore. Well sometimes I do by accident and then I can\u2019t chew with my mouth closed. I hate it. So I use a napkin to cover my mouth. I always have a good sized napkin so my mouth isn\u2019t showing at all because I can\u2019t stand eating with my mouth open. Even when I am alone (sounds foolish I know) but I can\u2019t just chew open mouthed!", "Yeah, this happens to the best of us, not gonna judge. But that is how you handle it with grace.", "It probably sounds very similar to choking", "\"Don't know how to stop\" is passive-aggressive for having absolutely no respect for boundaries. It's pretty easy to stop, when it's important.", "That makes total sense.  I used to work with a lot of vets, all branches, some of them were great people.  The ones who had a lot of issues, would use bring it up more, and use it as a justification for their bad behavior.", "And being early *is*.", "It's people that try to provoke you on first acquaintance without knowing anything about you that irk me. I always have to watch my temper around folk like that. \n\nThe sort of people that realise something annoys you, so insist on doing it. Not because they have to, but because they get off on annoying someone.", "Ah, Thanks. I\u2019m not sure I understand the context it was mentioned in.", "You're missing my point. I'm saying some people can't help it.", "Telling someone to \"mind their manners\" is you telling them to speak or behave properly and politely.  You can only tell someone this if they already know and have been taught their manners.\n\nAnother thing, they aren't in public, and OP continuously chewing with his mouth open isn't considered a mistake. If they don't know better than you should tell them and inform them. They can't improve if they don't know. \n\nAlso, if someone farts/burps loudly at the dinner table, that's just rude. There's trying to do it quietly, subtly, and just being loud. Being loud deserves correction, especially if they don't at least say excuse me.", "Literally never heard someone say that. It\u2019s \u201cmind your manners\u201d. They\u2019re also not in public.", "Tried eating cereal like this and almost drowned myself", "Jesus Christ have people on Reddit never had friends?", "He\u2019s saying that he is no longer that rank as he\u2019s no longer in the military, and it\u2019s not like his rank will magically appear if he scratches his arm.\n\nHe\u2019s saying the old vet giving OP shit is acting like he\u2019s still in the military even though he\u2019s just a regular guy now and should act like it.", "OP doesn't make it seem like they cant rather they don't see it as a big deal, so maybe keep things relevant to the conversation. He was also late. Let me guess some people can't help but failing to leave early enough to account for traffic.", ">\"Candidate\"\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "It's wild that you are getting downvoted so hard. It's not like military people are the only ones who need to be on time for something. Or are the only ones who chew with their mouth completely close. Like this is just about basic etiquette.", "Do the people they read about in other reddit posts count as friends?", "Sorry I didn't realize you were perfect and on time for everything. Traffic is unpredictable, even when u leave early. Shit happens.", "Reddit being Reddit, I guess. I say something is not military-excusive, someone moves the goalposts to call my dead grandma a dick, I get downvoted for defending her because actually being on time has made me a lot of good in my life.", "A whiter shade.", "Woah woah there buddy. I said your grandma is a dick if she talks to strangers that way. So did she?"]}
