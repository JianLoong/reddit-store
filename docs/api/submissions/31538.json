I told him that I was stuck in traffic but he did not appear to care.\n\nLater, when they served me delicacies, I was not \"closing my mouth\" while chewing, or that's what he said. I was NOT chewing with it open in a rude manner, but he said I should not open it even a bit while eating as that's what's \"respectful\" or something. I should have it with my mouth fully closed, which is really hard to do. I was frustrated but I did not say anything else.\n\nHe also asked me whether I exercise daily, and I said no. He asked at what time I wake up, and when I answered he said \"That's not ideal at all, it's going to harm you and Lisa if she marries you.\"\n\nAnd then he asked me what I do for a living.

I presume this was the evening (since it's dinner) and it's rush hour during the evening. Traffic is a contingency you need to plan for. The \"traffic\" excuse would not work for a job interview, and a job is less important than potential future family.\n\nChewing without closing your mouth _is_ weird and it's not \"really hard\" to chew with your mouth closed.\n\nNot exercising regularly is also, in the man's words, \"not ideal\", to say the least.

Man wtf is that close you mouth when you chew that\u2019s just basic manners. Don\u2019t act offended on being called out on a his, stop being defensive and just listen. For every one time some calls you out on something like that there was probably 10 other times no one said a thing but judged you on your bad manners.

You were in the army, but that doesn't mean you can act rudely like that to me\" included the part about the army independent of anything he said?

It sounds to me like he's a plain, garden variety asshole and it's not specifically veteran related. That said, fuck anyone that thinks being a veteran is a license to be an asshole.

Him being in the military isn't really the issue as much as he was scrutinizing you because he's an over protective father.  Yes. He was over the top and you deserved to be given a chance to get to know you instead of judged negatively from the start. \nParents often believe that \"no one is good enough for the daughter/ son\" and this guy is probably one of them. \nI get why you wanted to speak up when he talked down to you. He was being a jerk. But you calling him out like pretty much guarranties that you will never win him over and your Gf will be stuck in the middle trying to keep everybody happy. I would consider breaking up because the frustration isn't worth it. \nGood luck.", "I think this situation is more complicated than being an asshole or not. The traffick thing was genuine. So he is in the wrong for judging you based on that. But personally I come from a culture where it is common to ask those question. About the mouth open thing in plenty of cultures it is rude to do even slightly. You probably should not have bought up his military position. But depending from your perspective there may be culture differences and I do think he was maybe a bit harsh towards you. Best thing is to have a discussion with your girlfriend and maybe you both apologize, you for starting the arguement and him for being rude to you. But he needs to apologise too. Have a discussion with him friendly one. But generally it is a good thing to respect your elders. so yeah. But mainly i dont think you are an asshole. But I think have a open communication to establish a positive relationship", "NTA crazy army guy let him get lost.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
