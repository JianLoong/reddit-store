My brother (M 19) was living with us and simply paying us board that we allocated to household expenses, like food, part of the rent, utilities etc). He is working as an apprentice for a car dealership (In Australia that also means f#$k-all in terms of pay)\n\nThe trouble is that my brother has shown that he doesnt care at all about the cleanliness of his space or himself - He had left large greasestains on all of the walls in the house, he had never once willingly done his own laundry or dirty dishes, and we discovered month old rotting food in his room. He was also frequently late on the board with really crappy excuses like \"I had something come out of my account to the amount of $800\" - even though we later verified that was a complete lie. \n\nWe tried our hardest to motivate him to clean up but to no avail. So me and my mother decided that we would offer him an ultimatum - Sign a contract that entails his responsibilities in the house, or get out.\n\nThe contract was no more harsh than a standard rental agreement. It essentially said 3 things:\n\n- Clean your room to a reasonable degree (No stains on walls etc) and keep it that way\n- Pay your board on time unless otherwise communicated to us that he couldnt in a timely manner)\n- We would \"Inspect\" his room once a week at a set time for damage, general cleanliness etc. We also agreed not to touch any of his personal belongings or the contract was void.\n\nAny breach of those rules would need to be rectified within 24hrs or we would ask him to leave the premises. \n\nIf he refused to sign the contract after a week of negotiations, we would also ask him to leave. \n\nYou can probably guess by the title - he refused to sign the contract, even after we altered some of the content to better suit him. \n\nMy fear is that he is now out in the world, and he quite frankly has no clue about how things work as an adult, but his behaviour was so taxing on the rest of the household, we needed to do something.\n\nTLDR; Brother was a very unclean person, and refused to sign a contract that asked him to fix it, so we evicted him.", "created_utc": 1689327585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zbv5f/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_out_for_not_signing_a/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was even one of the things we changed - He wanted it at a set time so that he knew when we would be in his room. Its also not that different from a normal lease agreement here (You basically agree that a real estate agent can inspect the premises at any time with little notice. They even have their own keys!)"]}
