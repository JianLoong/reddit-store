Lol. Oh you think bro is just going to magically follow the rules? Rofl", "Can't be rolling on his floor tho cos it's probably dirty! Lol", "Exactly the point. That was even one of the things we changed - He wanted it at a set time so that he knew when we would be in his room. Its also not that different from a normal lease agreement here (You basically agree that a real estate agent can inspect the premises at any time with little notice. They even have their own keys!)", "NTA he\u2019s an adult now. If you\u2019re so worried bring him back and suffer. Otherwise, let him sink or swim.", "NTA\n\nHe is out in the world, and he put himself there. \n\nHe is a grown adult and he can make his own choices, even when they\u2019re very bad choices.", "NTA OP.  This is the very definition of a FAAFO situation: your brother f***ed around and found out.", "NTA. This is how he learns to be an adult.", "NTA, your contract was very fair, now he gets to learn the hard way how to be an adult.", "NTA. A twelve year old can meet those requirements, yet a 19 yr old can\u2019t? I shudder to think what will happen if he has a wife/kids.", "NTA. Time he grows up.", "NTA. He'll be back within a fortnight.", "NTA.  \nOne of 3 things are going to happen.  \n1, he'll realize that he was an ass, learn some hard lessons and eventually apologize for his past actions.   \n2, same as one, but exchange apology for resentment for being too harsh.  \n3, no change and he will resent anyone that tries to \"change him\" and generally be miserable for the rest of his life.", "NTA!!! Your brother wants to play at being an adult well he can now find out what it's like", "NTA Time for him to grow up. He's an adult so he needs to learn how to live like one.", "NTA as a Wiseman once told me, fuck around and find out.", "NTA - he's 19 and about to find out what it's like in the real world. He'll be back before the wnd of next week.", "NTA, you were fair to him. \nOnly thing I suggest, since you're worried about him, is telling him that if he changes his mind and is willing to sign the agreement (and actually behave better), it would be possible for him to come back.", "NTA. He will learn. And it sounds like learning out there without the safety net of you guys is important. I\u2019m also certain that if he came back, contrite and willing to sign, that y\u2019all would take him back, so he does still technically have a safety net. He\u2019ll learn, it\u2019ll be hard, and some people need the hard lesson. Stay strong.", "NTA. Not your problem. Mom should ask herself is she did something wrong or she just got an unlucky draw on a kid. You're 21 - just two years older - yet you've figured it out.\n\nGrease on the walls? How?", "\"Greasestains on the walls\"? Is this brother over 6? The way he is acting will mess up your security deposit on the apartment, and maybe get all of you evicted.", "Right, I don\u2019t think OP needs to worry about little brother wondering the big bad world alone. He\u2019s either going to step up or come home (hopefully with an apology)", "Can't speak for everywhere but, in the UK, real landlords absolutely do regular house inspections to make sure you haven't trashed the place. They have to let you know when they're coming but it's part of your rental agreement that they can do it.", "It hasn't been standard at the rentals I've stayed in here (Texas, US), however my current property manager (still Texas, US) does do 6 month inspections. Wasn't part of the contract and wasn't disclosed before lease signing, which left a bad taste in my mouth, but IMO it's still reasonable. So long as the expectation is there and notice is given, it's a reasonable policy.\n\nOnce a week is a bit much... However this roommate has proven to be exceedingly slovenly and a danger to OP's security deposit. I think it was warranted.", "Wait what? If you rent your apartment, the only person who should have keys is the person renting.\n\nIs this a usual thing in the US? Just letting my landlord or real estate agent enter my apartment would be a big no-no to me.", "Whoever owns the location has a copy of the keys for emergency purposes- including if you lock yourself out. And they are required by law to give you 24 hours notice. It also allows them to do things like get things fixed even if you can\u2019t be home. I get why it might seem unsettling, but it isn\u2019t nearly as sinister as it might seem.", "It is variable not only by state but by county within that state. My county in my state on the east coast has the following stipulation: \"A landlord is required to give a tenant 24 hours notice before entering the premises except in cases of emergency. The landlord must enter during normal business hours or at a mutually agreed upon time.\"", "The landlord will always have keys and you will be charged if you change the locks. The landlord has the right to entry with sufficient notice. Usually 24 or 48 hours is customary. In the case of a pluming leak or gas leak, there may be an emergency entrance.\n\nRemember who owns the property.", "Nta, hes gonna have to learn", "NTA\n\nHe will have to learn probably though the teach named consequences.\n\nContinuing to enable his behavior would not teach him responsibility.\n\nHe had choices.  This was HIS choice.  \n\nHe will fail or learn.  He will have setbacks than successes.  But only if he's allowed to grow.  Staying at home was stunting his being an adult.", "NTA.\n\n> My fear is that he is now out in the world, and he quite frankly has no clue about how things work as an adult\n\nThis is true of every 19 year old.  They all learn somehow.\n\nNow, that said, you might want to double-check with a tenancy lawyer that you had the right to simply kick him out.  Laws vary by jurisdiction; I think, for example, were I am, he wouldn't be considered a tenant as he didn't have a private bathroom and kitchen.\n\nBut yeah, if you're at the point where you need to try to jump through these hoops, it's time to let him figure things out on his own.", "Nta", "NTA. He\u2019s about to find out no one outside of you and your mom really cares about what happens to him. It\u2019s a lesson everyone has to learn sooner or later.", "No, the answer here is, if you need to be doing military/prison style bunk inspections, you shouldn't be bothering with a contract in the first place.", "What country do you live in, where estate agents can show up for \"inspections\" whenever they want? In the UK, the landlord/estate agent has to give 24 hrs notice and they cannot let themselves in. You have to be present and let them in yourself.", "While renting it, *I do*. That's the point. They cannot let themselves into the property without my permission, except in the case of major emergencies. That's at least how it works in the UK.", "Huh, fascinating how view points differ around the world. This wouldn't fly in Germany.\n\nIf the landlord isn't by chance a plumber, they wouldn't be allowed to fix stuff, a professional would do that. In case of eg a gas leak the landlord wouldn't be allowed into the property anyway, because only the fire department and/or gas company are fixing stuff like that. Simply because it is dangerous. And every other reason to enter the apartment is basically invalid.\n\nFor example: \nThe only people I have to let into my apartment are people who have to repair something, like the mentioned plumber, or those who read my water meter. And in the last case they have to give forward notice of two or three weeks. \n\nIn my case, with those water meters that are being used now, they can download data remotely outside my apartment, so one less reason to enter the property. \n\nOther than that police and fire department can enter your flat in case of danger or if they have a warrant signed by a judge. \n\nWho owns the property doesn't matter. If you rent, you are the only person allowed to enter. (and every other person you invite, of course). I think the only case in which something like an emergency key exists, might be in skyscrapers, so the fire department can enter quickly. But it could be that I am confusing that one with something I saw in a US Show like Chicago Fire or something. Too lazy to look it up. ^^", "If I think about it, I'm not sure anymore if a landlord couldn't repair stuff himself. At least I've never experienced that, stuff was always done by specialiced companies. And I've rented from big companies and private landlords alike.\n\nAt least the information I can find is not that clear about that.", "NTA - Sometimes, in order to get a baby bird to fly, it needs to be tossed out of the nest.  Either it flies, or it doesn't.", "*he had never once willingly done his own laundry or dirty dishes, and we discovered month old rotting food in his room.*\n\nNot an Aussie, but that would be it for me.  What little I know besides kangaroos, koalas and Steve Irwin, is pretty much everything will kill you.\n\nHave rotting food in your room?  Good chance something from the Jurassic period might show up.\n\nNTA.  Save yourselves!", "NTA.\n\nAs hard as it is, sometimes people need to sink before they learn to swim, or at least reach rock bottom before they are willing to learn.\n\nYou can't force someone to learn, but you can stop carrying their weight and let them suffer from their own inability.", "NTA", "When you have month old food rotting in your room, you lose the right to that kind of privacy. Especially in apartments where the cockroaches you attract not only end up being your family's problem, but that of the neighbors' as well.\n\nHe'll probably hobosexual it up. I pity whoever he tricks into sheltering him next, but you and your mother are definitely NTA.", "Doesn't work that way in the US.", "When they say landlord coming into fix things they mean landlord letting in the proper people to fix, not literally the owner of the property coming and fixing your sink.", "Most things don't work in the US tbf", "Ah ok, that makes sense to me"]}
