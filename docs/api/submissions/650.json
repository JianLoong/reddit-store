{"id": 650, "submission_id": "yhamdv", "title": "AITA for confronting my friends?", "selftext": "My first time writing my thoughts on Reddit on this subject, so here we go.\n\nSince i was 5 years old, my mother passed away. She contracted ALS shortly after giving birth to me. My aunt is my mother's older sister who has taken good care of me and my family since my mother died. My aunt sacrificed everything to take care of my family. I consider her as my own mother. I have a sense of responsibility to make my aunt happy. At least it's something I can do everyday.\n\nI have friends named \"Alex\" and \"Ben\". We've been friends since high school. We have become close friends so we always entrust everything to each other. I myself am also happy to know them. But that all changed back in November 2021.\n\nI was visiting Ben's house and saw that Alex & Ben and some of my other friends were having a group chat without me in it. I had a bad feeling and Ben was away. I read the conversation they had. And I was surprised because they mentioned me with all kinds of negative things. I am angry. I was blinded by my anger and I logged into Ben's account on my phone without him knowing to see how far the group conversation went. At that time I could only be silent and take a deep breath as to whether my attitude and behavior in the past made them say negative things about me. When Ben came back I couldn't help but smile painfully knowing that my friend was talking behind my back.\n\nDecember 2021. My aunt was rushed to the hospital, I panicked and stressed because she is one of the people I care about. I spent all my savings for a month and now she is doing well. I told Ben my aunt's condition after she was released from the hospital.\n\nAfter that, the new year 2022 comes. It hasn't even been a day until January 2, 2022. I saw Ben's group chat. I saw Ben saying the stuff i told Ben. I didn't tell anyone about it except Ben. Alex replied to the chat with one sentence that i still remembered to this day. \"My aunt is in the hospital, I want to tell Ben a dramatic story. That bastard can't be an adult or what? Hahaha.\" said Alex.\n\nI snapped. I know that Alex and Ben were hanging out in the park at the time. I went straight to them and vented all sorts of anger on them. I took out my cellphone and showed the contents of their conversation so far. Alex and Ben were shocked and angry at that. They said they were disappointed with my behavior that I should respect people's privacy. I haven't seen them again since then. My social media account is blocked by Alex. I cut ties with the people in the conversation, including Ben.\n\n302 days and counting. I still can't get those those memory out of my head. I introspect myself and behavior during that time. Part of me still hate myself for violating Ben's privacy but there's also a part of me wishing I could go back in time and not read their group chats at all. Until now, I did the right thing or not. And i still don't know if what i did made me an asshole. What do you think?  \n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for some of the answers that have been given to me. I apologize that I justified my behavior at that time in anger. Now I'm relieved to tell this story and I know and admit my fatal mistake for invading my friend's privacy, although the way to get information about my friends against myself can be done in other more ethical ways. Now, I will introspect myself again and try to go to a psychologist, and be ready to look for new friendships in the future.", "created_utc": 1667124256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhamdv/aita_for_confronting_my_friends/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sympathetic to your circumstances, and I'm really sorry that you had to go through losing so many trusted friends during such a difficult time. While your friends are the biggest assholes, it was still wrong to invade Ben's privacy. If you were a worse person, you might have gone through his account looking for other things you could use to hurt him (and I hope and believe you didn't), so you understand why that would be upsetting to Ben even if he was talking shit behind your back.\n\nI wouldn't regret this though, if I were you. Yeah, you got your feelings hurt by doing something you shouldn't have, but ultimately this ended with you leaving a friend group that wasn't really friendly to you. I hope you've had the opportunity to start building new friendships since then.", "YTA and a creep.", "YTA for snooping and hacking. They are AHs for the content of the chat.
