I'm guessing you ignored the red flags in favor of $$$$ and are now regretting that.", "Yta - and he's right. If you don't want a co-parent, then you shouldn't be having a kid with him. You DO have a problem with his daughter. I also don't understand why you would wash dishes when you literally pay someone to do that.", "YTA. Why are you with someone that you don't want raising your child? Asking him to be an absent parent instead of just discussing expectations is absolutely wild. You may not like how he parents, but you have absolutely no right to limit his involvement in his child's life.", "So......

You're the AH for what you said AND because you've failed to see the holes in your 'logic'. \n\n1) Everyone's parenting styles are different. Discuss what is important to you for your child's development and behavior. Agree on a plan, don't just be a dictator.\n2) He actually has parenting experience.\n3) You are not his daughter's mother. It is not up to you to give her new chores just because you've moved in. You need to discuss changes with your BF first. \n4) idk about you but I was a complete B**** at 14. My mom and I joke about it now but I wasn't great to her attitude wise. Sure, this girl may be entitled and rude but consider Her POV. You are just her dad's GF, not fiance, not her Stepmom, etc. You've moved into Her house and you're trying to change things. You're passing judgement on her and how she was raised. She is a privileged girl. That doesn't mean her upbringing was wrong or your BF's parenting sucks. Hopefully, she grows out of the entitlement and is nicer but for now, I'm chalking this up to she's 14. \n5) I don't think you're getting the big picture. Despite your judgements, his daughter is a healthy girl. She has food, shelter, and it doesn't sound like she's getting into trouble. These are important core factors for Your child that you've overlooked in your judgement.\n\nI'd sit down with your BF and APOLOGIZE. Explain your POV but try to be less judgemental towards him and his daughter. Explain what you want for your child.

He won't magically change and he's told you that.

You can\u2019t live with the father of your child and just expect him to not parent? Also your kid is not some toy you program, they\u2019re gonna act however tf they want despite how you raise them. So either you sit down and hash out your expectations from each other as parents or you\u2019re gonna have an even tougher time raising your kid.\n\nMy bf had a kid from a previous relationship. I also did not like how he was raising him and he also had sole custody. I would share what I thought and make comments or recommendations but I didn\u2019t overstep. When we had our kid together, he was aware of where I stood and how I felt. I\u2019m not saying we never disagree, but he carried a different attitude with raising our daughter and I let him have his separate relationship with her and I have my own as well.

You're not wrong for wanting a better upbringing for your child, but how you're going about it is completely unreasonable, selfish, and arrogant.\n\nYou have got yourself in this situation now, it's too late to go back. So, the only options I see going forward is if you stay living with him and let him be an equal parent (which he has the right to be, regardless of your feelings), or you leave him, move somewhere else, and get him to pay child support.

I'm sorry but how do feel like he is going to feel knowing that his gf doesn't want him to parent his child? The child that he helped create? He may feel some resentment towards you in the future and the only outcome I can see out of this is you being miserable because your left with all of the work because you wouldn't allow him to do anything. Maybe he wont spoil this child but the least you could do is give him a chance, especially if you do love him.\n\nThink of how this is going to affect the baby. They are going to grow up thinking that their dad doesn't love them because they wont play, teach, feed or do anything parenting related with them. They will just see him as some sort of wallet and possibly resent him in the future because he never truly was her father. Just some guy that lives with them seemingly doesn't have any interest in partaking in their life. This is going to affect him as well if you actually go through with this because he will see his kid yet remember that you basically don't want him in their life.\n\nSorry but YTA, I hope you don't actually go through with this because he IS the kids father.", "Yta.   \n\nYou knowingly got pregnant with a man that you don't like his parenting style.\n\nRaising kids is hard.\n\nRaising kids on your own is even harder.\n\nI suspect in about a year, if he stays and doesn't go to court so that he can have his rights as a father, you'll be on here complaining your man isn't getting up 4 times a night to feed the kid and change its diapers.

( get it, but that's the answer) Look, let's assume you have valid concerns with his parenting style. (No mention of the mom of the 14-year-old.) He sounds like he loves the kid, but yeah, might spoil her. \n\nThis wasn't the way to approach it, and it's not feasible. You can't have it so he's just there but can't be a father and has to run every little thing by you. That's controlling, and it won't have the desired effect. You might just trade one set of problems for another as your baby will grow up feeling as if daddy doesn't love them like his other daughter. Or he'll still spoil her, and you'll just be seen as the bad guy. \n\nSaying, I have certain values I want to instill in her, and I'd like to talk about it.

My advice: leave now or terminate. Or both.

The aforementioned prevalent issue that is his kid. How do you see this blended family working out? How do you see his daughter treating your daughter? Does he let you take part in certain parental aspects with his daughter since you\u2019re likely going to be her step mom? If not, how\u2019s it gonna go if the older girl doesn\u2019t get along with her half sister down the road?

Any interaction with a child from a parent can be considered parenting. Do you not want him to buy the child anything, even necessities like food, clothing, etc? Do you not want the child to live in his house? At that point, you just want to be a single parent.
