To clarify, After he does all that is needed of him, he sits on my couch and plays video games all day. I know that he is meeting his part of the agreement, but it doesn't sit well with me that he is spending 8+ hours a day using my Xbox, internet, and streaming service in my bedroom; when he could be getting out there and finding a new hobby or something that could better himself with.\n\nSo this leads me to ask, Would I be the asshole if I made him go out and do something productive? like hitting the gym or going to a library or something along those lines?   \n\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks for the feedback. I generally agree with the stance of whats being said. Im not going to tell him what to do by any means, but instead, I'm going to suggest a few hobbies or things like that to encourage him to do other things.

I mean you can suggest hobbies to him, or if you have time do something with him. If he's doing exactly what you asked of him he's not doing anything wrong.", "INFO: does he contribute to any bills? Does his playing get on your routine? As in do you have trouble sleeping due to his playing, is it stopping you from having an environment so that you can study in your room etc?", "INFO: How long has he been staying with you guys?

How are you guys confirming that he\u2019s actually applying?", "I think you just need to talk to him and explain that you need a little more personal time, which is difficult if he's in your space all the time. NTA if you go about it the right way.", "NAH. I would talk to him and express your concerns, but also keep in mind that your interpretation of the situation might not be the most accurate, and listen to what he has to say. \n\nFirst off, video games can BE a hobby. They\u2019re no more or less productive than stamp collecting or bird watching. \n\nAnd also, keep in mind that what is often interpreted as laziness in the neurotypical world is a symptom of undiagnosed ADHD, ASD, or other similar issue. Not having graduated high school is also pretty typical in this kind of situation. Go into the conversation honestly, but with humility since you may not know the whole story.", "NTA-it\u2019s your Xbox! I\u2019m shocked he\u2019s allowed on it at all!You don\u2019t need to confront him,say you\u2019re lending it to a nephew ect and just pack it away.my kid has consoles and I\u2019m not allowed near them despite me being the one paying!it\u2019s costing you in electric for him to sit there", "YTA - if he's continuously applying for jobs and working on his GED, as well as cleaning up, he isn't just sitting on his ass playing games all day. He \\*is\\* doing work and being productive. You just aren't seeing it because he's not doing it in 8 hour bursts like the working world does.", "YTA - You said he's doing his part of the agreement. If you want to add on to that agreement, like, submit 20 applications a day or something like that, that's one thing. You are trying to dictate how he keeps himself entertained. That's overstepping your boundaries.", "YTA, you already gave him a list of ways you want to control his life, so you really need to give him more?  He already has a move out date.  You are being judgmental when you really don\u2019t need to be.  I suggest going to the gym or finding a hobby.", "YTA.  If he's meeting the requirements that were put in place, then it's a dick move to demand other things.  You're going to \"make him go and do something productive\" ---how?", "YTA. He\u2019s meeting the requirements that were set before him. It\u2019s not your business what his hobbies are. You\u2019re also not his parent, and what you\u2019re describing is basically parenting him/treating him as a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You actually thought he would do more than the bare minimum to be able to live in your decent apartment? Sorry, but I\u2019m actually surprised he is doing that. If you want him to not use your game system or watch tv all day, you need to not have that stuff there or available. I know he\u2019s an adult, but he needs a parent to tell him \u201cNo. Go study. Go out and ride your bike. No TV on weekdays.\u201d Get a couple of books for your room. Might have to explain to him what it is. He will be motivated to get the heck out, and make his own money.", "How long will it take him to complete the GED course?\n\nConsider upping the school requirement to 4 hrs a day.    That would be half a work day.", " We all pay into the apartment so it was a collective agreement, and there really wasn't any other spot in the place where  he could sleep.", "Im probably going to take that approach. I'm obviously not going to force him to do anything he doesn't want to, but at the minimum, I am going to suggest a few things he can do beyond just laying in my room all day.", "His GED program occupies only two hours of the day. My apartment is small and the only part that he really needs to clean is my room (along myself as well) and the kitchen occasionally. My family cleans the house as well. So the cleaning that he is doing isnt necessarily akin to cleaning a whole house.\n\nThe guy plays video games up until 3 am, wakes up at 10, spends about 4 hours doing whats needed of him and then just gets back to playing video games. It's kind of a groundhog cycle that's getting to me because he doesn't leave my room unless he is getting door dashed food or using the bathroom.", "I get he didn\u2019t have any other place to go but.. why you? How close is this friend? Close enough for you to pay for a course and your family to let him stay rent free? So they know that this arrangement is not convenient to you?", "How is he affording DoorDash?", "This sounds like it\u2019s your parents\u2019 apartment and you may (or may not) contribute to the bills. My question is, are you working or going to school? If you are, is his game playing disrupting your sleep? If so, you have a right to put a limit on how late he can play in your room. This needs to be discussed with your parents first so you are on the same page.", "He is my best friend. He's been there for me since high school and we've been through a lot together. The course isn't that expensive as it's only 20$ a month. and to clarify, while he isn't paying rent his mother is paying my family rent in lieu of that.   \n\n\nTo also clarify, he cant stay with any one else because his mother is in a women's shelter. She has money and isn't necessarily broke, its just that the landlord (in a very illegal manner) broke the law by evicting the family out of the blue without a 2 week warning.  I was his only choice save for another shelter.", "He often uses his girlfriends money.", "I pay a 3rd of the rent, some of the utilities, the internet, and the streaming services in my house. I work part-time and I go to school part-time, alongside being in the ARNG.  Additionally, I am probably gonna take the rout of discussing this with my family about this.", "Then you need to talk to him. Being friends and living together every day, even sleeping in the same room is not the same. He\u2019s still doing what is expected of him but I can understand this change in your environment is getting to you", "Why can\u2019t he live with his girlfriend?", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't about the requirements. This is about you have no personal space because he is always in your room. That would drive me bonkers. On top of that, it must be hard to sleep when  someone is playing Xbox mere feet from you until 3 AM.\n\nI think it would be reasonable to establish a lights out time. I also think it would be reasonable to create some alone time for both of you. You sound like you are out of the room a lot and he isn't ever. That means he gets alone time and you don't. Tell him he needs to get a hobby that he can do outside of the apartment for a couple hours a week or whatever seems reasonable. It won't kill him, it will be healthier for both of you.", "I resonate the most with this.", "so your roomates are family?", "Just so you know the story they are telling you is not true, people don\u2019t just stay in shelters for fun", "because his gf is also homeless and finding a living situation of her own. Her money comes from her father."]}
