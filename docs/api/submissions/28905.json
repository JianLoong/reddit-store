N T A if this is becoming a Super Big Deal.\n\nYour sister's concern is well-intended. She doesn't want her stepdaughter to be treated like an unwanted interloper.\n\nHowever, she's not taking into account both the fact that you barely know this girl and also the fact that she's much younger than your nephew.

You do not have to justify your decisions.\n\nSecondly, it makes logical sense to base your rationale on ages. You're right- adults are more likely than children to be more careful with property, and also you've known your nephew significantly longer and know how he will treat your books. Your step-niece... you need a \"trial run\" so to speak, in order to trust her for future reference.", "NTA.  Of course you prefer the person you've his whole life over a newcomer of 6 months.

You have known you nephew all his life, he is 18 & you no doubt know you can trust him with your books. \nNot to be harsh,but of course you prefer your nephew, you have known him for 18 years, compared to your step neice of 6 months.", " There are many things you\u2019d trust most 18 year olds with that you wouldn\u2019t an 11 year old.

Sometimes a particular book cover is discontinued or a book isn't printed anymore. Or you treat your books with care and don't want them to be damaged. There are multiple reasons why you wouldn't just want anyone to borrow your books.\n\nAlso OP has known their nephew for all of his life and knows he treats their books with care wheras they've only known the step-niece for a couple of months and therefore cannot yet know how she treats books.", "Step niece is not OP\u2019s kin.  Step niece is the daughter of her sisters wife.  For 18 years, OP has known her nephew.  Respect is EARNED.

She's just not giving them all of them at once.", "And yet the kid isn't entitled to ANY of the OPs books, even if it is sisters step kid.

I wouldn't trust some 11yo with my books either, they tend to loose and damage things rather easily", ">This should be worth more to OP than things.\n\nYeah, no. Her sister's husband's kid wanting a book is not more important to someone than their books. I'm so tired of people who marry people with kids and expect everyone in their family to sacrifice for those kids. As long as they're not treated bad, then it's okay. \n\n>different treatment doesn't help with that\n\nOp knows nephew for 18yo. She met step daughter 6 months ago. Of fucking course different treatment is gonna happen.", "There's absolutely no way I would allow someone that I don't know well, borrow any of my books, even family.\n\nIn fact, some of my own family members are banned from borrowing any of my books and I'm talking about blood family, not married in.\n\nI've had an expensive first edition Fellowship of the ring, have its spine destroyed by someone who didn't know how to look after a book properly. After that, people need to earn my trust", "Nope. Not true. They did not agree to accept her into the family. The Nephew's parent did. I'm tired of people trying to force relationships onto people.", "It has nothing to do with being integrated/wanted though.\nIt\u2019s a a age and known responsibility issue. Doesn\u2019t matter step-sister or not. Could it have been phrased better than some kid at the end, yea. But OP\u2019s concern and reasoning is a very valid point and no one is entitled to them niece, nephew or otherwise. \nIn fact OP is being welcoming by still allowing them to borrow one also instead of flat out saying now despite not knowing them well and age don\u2019t you think? That\u2019s courteous. They could have said no not at all. \n\nThere are sometimes reasons that are valid to receive different treatment. My sister has daughters of varying ages from like 3 to 13.  All nieces, none of them step or not. And I love them all equally. But I\u2019m certainly not going to let a 6 year old handle or borrow the same stuff as a 13 year old because they do indeed treat things differently. Even if they were the same age and one took better care of things I\u2019d be the same way. \nDid the same thing with friends. I wouldn\u2019t loan a book to a close friend that I knew was page creased and would rip them easily. Drove me nuts. But other who didn\u2019t and treated them as prestigious as I did sure. And if I wanted to give them a chance and be nice I\u2019d do just what OP did. Let them borrow one at a time, or one at the start to see how it goes. I explain my expectations and boundaries and if those can\u2019t be respected then you might get more next time. Such as please do your best to not spill anything on it or lose it, don\u2019t fold the pages to mark a spot. Do not highlight or annotate inside my book. And do not fold back the spine of the book please. It is not in the court to be respectful of my property or not. If they don\u2019t, no more books for them. \nIt\u2019s not just about the money it\u2019s about respect, appreciation, and sentimental value. 11 yo vs 18 yo Is a huge difference. Hell if it was the other way and the 18 y/o wasn\u2019t as known and potentially trashy but the 11 y/o was super careful then same thing! Doesn\u2019t have to do with being family or not. AND more importantly being family still does not make you entitled to someone else\u2019s property. Doesn\u2019t have to mean that property is worth more than the person either. People are allowed to have boundaries and standards. No is an acceptable answer. No one is entitled. OP is NTA. Sister should be smart enough to explain to the kid the diffences between the two in this scenario and can ask OP hey, if she takes really good care of it this time, do you think maybe next time she could borrow 2? \nOP didn\u2019t imply they\u2019d never agree to that. Encourage the. just wants their property respected and taken care of. Infact it\u2019s better to teach the kid to respect other peoples property and appreciate it and the person. \nDon\u2019t need to teach the kid that she\u2019s entitled to something just because brother got that treatment. What happens if it\u2019s brothers friend loaning him a book? Same thing? Why does he get one and not me?", "Op doesn\u2019t said step niece can\u2019t have books it\u2019s only one at the time that\u2019s totally reasonable. Like never be bored said it\u2019s a great opportunity to bond and get to know each other better. The age is a great factor in it. And by the way you treat every child differently based on age, interests, character etc. They don\u2019t know each other very well and I wouldn\u2019t borrow someone I don\u2019t know especially that young and expensive book set.", "My daughter is very particular  about her books.  She would  never  fold down the corner or set rhe book down face down to save her spot.\nAnd these aren't old books\n\nNTA", "OP didn't write anything about the books being special. I get why OP feels that way but two new step-siblings should not be treated differently for no good reason, it's just not worth it in my eyes.", "The kids are now step-siblings aren't they? Also there is no word of the books being special, so it's just things one can buy with money, but the situation for the kids must be hard as it is and I see no good reason to treat them differently because that agravates it.", "I would burn down my rather big library if I knew it makes that girl feel wanted and part of the family - we are different.", "Oh no, my heart goes out to you. Agree 100%", "This. When I was little I lost my ever loving shit on a friend a because they bent the spine of a back and folded down pages. I was fuming. After I cooled off I explained what upset me. \nDid not let them borrow any books again for a long time. After some time they realized to respect my property and went through the effort of showing me that they can do that to earn borrowing books back. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nI was so aggressive about it and thought they were completely ruined and if those pages got folded! How dare.", "So what?  One is nearly an adult, and was is not yet a teenager. Why should they be treated equally with respect to borrowing property?", "Lol, this is weird. She just didn't let her borrow tons of books, she didn't threw her out in the snow. People really exagerate when it comes to step situations on aita", "Send her your books then.", "The mother of the girl is claiming that it *might* make her upset. Up until this point there's zero indication of any hurt feelings or the child even knowing or caring that she gets only one book at a time. And frankly, just don't mention that the 18 year old can borrow the set at once and there should be no root for any upset. She's being lend a book, that is kind.", "I worked in the kids section of a public library for 9 years (until 2022), and I was the 11-year-old who could take out 20 books and return them in good condition (and read!) next week. I would not trust 90% of my peers with my own books at that age, and as a librarian, at least half (and often more!) of the age 9-13 crowd would lose books (found a month later or when a parent helped).\n\nAlso at 11, I'd had teachers assign book report books based on perceived reading level (I got All Creatures Great And Small, one seat-neighbor got Nancy Drew, the other seat-neighbor got Frog And Toad), I was in advanced classes and others that weren't advanced, I learned the middle school band director wouldn't give solos to any kids who weren't there 6 months because he didn't know who of us would be responsible enough to practice, and I knew that my sister in HS got treated differently because she was older.\n\nIf that 11-year-old has any sense, observation skills, or life experience that isn't being spoiled, then a simple explanation of 'I don't know how fast you read or how you treat books yet' will be everything needed for her to understand and feel okay with it.", "The only reason she feels unwanted is because the sister told her she should feel that way. If she explained that older kids get more liberties, she would be upset, but in a different more manageable way.", "We certainly are.", "Because the old one is almost out of the house I guess and the little one is new to the family and will stay for some years now, so one needs to incorporate her. That doesn't work if you don't treat her like family, obviously.", "You guys are way too fond of things/money and not enough of people, especially kids.", "If we talk around anecdotal evidence: Where I'm from, most kids go to school alone starting first grade, by foot/bike, even if they need to take trains, they are left alone at home if needed and so on. If you borrow something and don't give it back in imaculate condition, there goes your pocket money down the drain, even if it's a year's worth, you need to pay it back or work it off. We don't make members of the family earn love nor their place, they are trusted and are equals from the start and only face consequences if they fail. Also it doesn't matter if they are blood related, married in is \"worth\" the same, especially if they aren't adults. That makes sense to me.", "agreed. this one's on the sister and how she spins it. \n\nETA: INFO, though. i am wondering about the history involving step niece. is sister insecure about how she herself is/not integrating step niece? and what sort of history has there been between OP and step niece?", "If she'll stay for years she can wait till she's proven she can look after them, there's no rush.", "Why should someone else's kids mean more to me than my own possessions?", "Your right, I am. I despise kids what's your point", "I love kids. That does not mean I have to give them everything they demand. You're the one mixing up love and materialism.\n\nOP's sister was the one to create drama out of a non-issue. Step-sister or not, OP barely knows the kid and isn't wrong to \"test\" the kid first. Op's sister could've  dealt with this situation in so many ways without causing drama, but chose to go the irrationally overprotective drama route.", "NTA:\n\n1. It\u2019s obvious that an eighteen year old can be trusted and granted more privileges than an eleven year old, for example, driving a car\n\n2. It\u2019s normal to trust people you know well over new additions to the family", "NTA - Would you let the 11 year old borrow your car because you lend it to the 18 year old? No. Older kids get more privileges and responsibilities. That's life. \n\nMaybe, if she proves herself responsible and able to take care of things well, you'll lend more, but she's a kid who's still learning and it's smart to set reasonable expectations.", "NTA borrowing things isn't a right, it's a privilege.", "NTA, that's what your sister is there for. To help teach her step daughter that it's not about liking him more, it's about earning your trust with your important things.", "Nta he's an adult he get different treatment than an 11 year old and if your sister say anything else tell her she need to shut up grow up your property your rules", "Ask your SIL if she'll be letting her daughter drive home, too", "I have a book that is worth more than my TV.
