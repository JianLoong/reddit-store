After my parents (48 F and 37 M) had an argument, I took up the role of being my younger siblings part-time care taker to help my parents to figure out their problems. \n\nNow I have been in a relationship for just over six months with my boyfriend (17) and another thing to mention, I am currently 10 weeks pregnant without anyone in my family or my boyfriend knowing.\nMy older sister (18) is have difficult to deal with since I started year 11, and our parents aren't making things easier. She hasn't approved of my relationship since the beginning since my boyfriend rejected her long before we started dating. A few days ago I finally snapped after I was forced to make dinner just after hanging clothes on the line and giving my younger sister and a few of my nieces a bath, I was tired and cranky because I hadn't eaten the entire day and I hadn't slept well well the night before.\n\nSo I snapped and told my sister (18) \"Get off her lazy, spiteful and self-centred a*s to come up me to make dinner or at least get the younger children dressed after their baths\". She was not very happy and told me to quote \"Stop acting like I was the mother of everyone in the house and that I needed to stop acting as if I was pregnant\" now after she said that i was dumbfounded and shocked about it because as mentioned earlier, no one in my family knows I'm pregnant and I don't show it either. My mother has a tendency to take my sister's side whenever we get into arguments over anything, so after my sister said that to me, my mother agreed with her and told me that I needed to apologise to my sister because I stepped out of line and I have been for a while.\n\nMy father on the other hand agrees with me because my sister had been doing this to me since I was little around 4 or 5, now this might be where I might be the a*shole. I have told my mother and sister that if they continue to treat me like I'm a slave and the carer of my siblings, then I would pack up everything I owned and go live with my older sister (25) so I was away from them and closer to my boyfriend another reason I want to live with my sister is because she and my brother-in-law have always been so nice and caring towards me and my boyfriend, they helped us through a tough time in our relationship that had been the result of my sister (18) trying to break us up. \n\nI'm at a loss right now because I have no idea what I should do, I don't want to leave my younger siblings at home with my older sister but I also can't stay at this house anymore. \n\nSo AITA for wanting to live with my older sister to get away from my other older sister?", "created_utc": 1686534153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/147bo1n/aita_for_wanting_to_live_with_my_older_sister_to/", "score": 389, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your obligation, even though it might be the \"nice\" thing to do.\n\nBTW, can you give a little bit of background on your family? Your mom had her sixth? seventh? child at 21 years old?

You need to tell your family get that sorted out with your bf and family which ever way you want to handle it keep or not before you consider moving out. Secondly do not move into a siblings home without even letting them know your pregnant it just makes you a bigger A for putting that burden on someone else who had no say in the matter.", "NTA, though you better tell older sister (25) before you move in.
