Have your husband talk to him to make sure the message gets through.\n\nAnd 5.4 is not short.", "NTA. That kind of \u2018joke\u2019 is a dominance gesture that you turned over by throwing him out of your space. Hold the line, firmly educate your husband about what kind of joking is acceptable, and make him responsible for keeping his twit brother to respectful behavior. \n\nIf brother can\u2019t behave himself and be respectful to you, he shouldn\u2019t be in your home. It\u2019s also your husband\u2019s home, but this is a two yeses situation. If any of your friends tried to bully-tease your husband, I\u2019d say the same.", "Info: it sounds like this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s brought this up? Have you told either your husband or his brother how you feel about the comments before this? What was their reaction?", "Nta, it's bullying disguised as jokes", "Nta.  \n\nYou don't get to make fun of people who don't want it and still stay in their house.  \n\nHe can sit on the steps until your husband comes out to meet him.", "NTA. He knows you don't like it and while we can all brush off the odd joke, this wasn't that. He likes getting a reaction which is just being a bully. Hopefully he learned something here. You don't have to put up with harassment in your own home, and since you say he knows you don't like it, good for you! It matters not one bit whether you're sensitive about your height. This is deliberate antagonistic behaviour. He doesn't care even what his brother says. Sounds like an obnoxious jerk", "NTA But your BIL and your husband are, as is anyone who thinks you're wrong. \n\nHeightism is rampant in our culture. Replace your height with skin color,  weight,  or any other personal characteristics, and this list would be flooded with outrage.  \n\nI'm a male in the US approaching 70 years of age. I'm 5 foot six. As a child, I was always the smallest boy in my class. This introduced a lot of challenges, but that's childhood.\n\nAs an adult, I've heard all the Napoleon Complex, short or small man complex, made to me, targeted at others. Only once have I seen any kind of realization that maybe that comment was inappropriate.\n\nIt's not something I've obsessed about, but it was always a consideration, especially in the business world.  \n\nThat's my blurb on heightism.  It doesn't matter to me now. But maybe when everyone is so focused on being sensitive and woke, we could include height .\n\nBut for you, OP, your BIL is attacking you with whatever he can find. It's not your height he has an issue with, it's you. And your husband knows this and is supporting his brother over you.\n\nI'd find something the BIL is, or could be made to, feel sensitive about and target that every time he makes a short comment. And I would simply stop interacting with BIL until your husband grows a pair and defends you against his idiot brother.", "INFO: Did you ask him to stop first or did you just jump to kicking him out?\n\nIf you asked him to stop and he didn\u2019t, NTA.

But I guess those who think you threw him out the second he made a joke are the people who think: \"It's just a joke!\" is a excuse for everything and will go ballistic the moment someone disagrees with them :D", "NTA. You're average height! Besides, size is not a reliable indicator of personality - as they found out.", "NTA\nYour husband is an AH", "NTA. If you had done it without first warning him that he was being offensive or pissing you off then it would be different. However, because he knew it was unacceptable yet he persisted time and time again; you were fine to throw him out. A better way would have been to chew him out the entire time he was trapped there waiting for your hubby, and detail  exactly how he was wrong and being verbally offensive  - so that (hopefully) he would understand and realize that behavior is unacceptable with anyone - and change! Instead he still thinks that you are the meanie and he's doing nothing actually wrong.  I've been dealing with my husband with similar behavior and it's taken a few angry conversations to get him to see how his version 'teasing/joking around' is harmful, which someday will save him from being in trouble with HR at work!", "I\u2019m curious why you didn\u2019t just walk away but your house, your rules ... NTA", "ESH \"I\u2019m not insecure about my height\"? Obviously, you are a bit. He probably thought he was funny although he was not. I think you should have just told him he wasn't and it was making you uncomfortable and to stop. In the end, hopefully, he got the message.  Throwing him out was a bit of an over reaction though", "YTA\n\nHave you considered...asking him to stop? You went 0 to 100 over something that is very minor. He may not have realized it was bothering you so much.\n\nI feel like you skipped a few steps in regards to escalation.", "Bruh why so harsh", "YTA\n\nthat\u2019s literally he true definition of sensitive. i\u2019m 5\u20194 and i\u2019d rather be pestered for being short than being tall and being called a giraffe or something. there\u2019s girls who would kill to be shorter. being short for a woman is common, 5\u20192-5\u20196 is considered average lol. i think you\u2019re definitely TA and very sensitive. i\u2019m assuming your pregnant with the two babies comment so it makes sense, i wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy.", "Nta You may have social consequences for your short temper but that will only be a small problem that communication can sort out.", "YTA. You don't just throw someone out of the house because of a joke. First you explain it is upsetting and ask them to stop. Then if they continue you inform them you meant it and warn them you will be forced to ask them to leave if they continue. Then, if they continue, you can ask them to leave. You went nuclear without warning", "A very very soft YTA, because it seems seriously harsh of you\n\nINFO : did you forewarn him at all, like to say something along the lines of \"if you don't shut up, you're gonna have to leave\"?  \n\nIs this something he does to you often? Were you just having a shit day? \n\nIf he had a warning and a chance to knock it off, but persisted, THEN got thrown out then I would say not the AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What good does kicking him out right before he and your husband are about to leave anyway? Pretty rude to blow up your husbands day over a joke while he\u2019s in the shower. I\u2019d bet your BIL is just trying to make playful sibling banter, did you grow up an only child? An honest and open conversation would fix this. I know you say you arent insecure about your height, but this wouldn\u2019t bother you if you weren\u2019t.
