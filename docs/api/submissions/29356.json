I am not looking to defend his behavior, but I do want to offer a potential explanation, based on my experience.  He is likely very afraid for you and may not be able to express that.  His solution here, is sort of like denial/bargaining, which is trying to find a way for you to not have this disease.

Or has he not come home and not reached out at all? \n\nYou are having a medical crisis and you need support. He can be upset and grieving over you diagnosis but that doesn\u2019t give him the ok to be a jerk to you. You didn\u2019t ask to be sick or do anything to become sick. \n\nI\u2019d be very worried about his behavior. Illness and injury are part of life.

There's nothing worse than having a partner be diagnosed with something that can be life changing but you feel like you can't do anything. Sometimes just being there for some people isn't enough.\n\nYou probably didn't need to respond in the manner you did but it's a tough day for you hearing that news, so it'll be understandable.

I think that is said to be controlled by diet and exercise (sometimes) so that may have been what he was seeing online.", "NTA - You've just been handed a potentially life changing, and even life threatening diagnosis. Your boyfriend has now made it all about himself, accusing you of asshole behavior when all you really needed from him was some support and solidarity in dealing with it.\n\nThere may have been an argument for him having good intentions if he'd stopped while he was ahead, but even that's a stretch. He stopped trying to be helpful the moment the questions turned into an interrogation and an undercurrent of what I am interpreting as blame. He could have reined it in when he saw that you were upset, but he instead chose to call you an asshole and left you there with another reason to be upset.\n\nThis is not the behavior of someone you want by your side after such a diagnosis, or any really. What a real partner would do is research the condition, ask how he can be of help to you, and reassure you that you're in this together. He has done none of those things.\n\nHe has shown you what he is. I would act accordingly. If you were adrift in the ocean and had a heavy chain around twisted around your leg,  you would discard it, right?
