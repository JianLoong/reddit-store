His diet consists of mac and cheese, pogos, chicken fingers etc. while I\u2019m a vegetarian. Our daughter takes after both of us but we find she gravitates more toward the fruits and veggies which is great, but I feel like she should be able to try fun things now and then and that\u2019s where my husband disagrees. It\u2019s not that she can\u2019t have fun treats, but it\u2019s only okay if HE brings it into the house. Whenever I do, he gets angry. \n\nI do the groceries every weekend and sometimes I like to get her something new to try. I remember loving toaster strudel as a kid because it was something special I didn\u2019t get very often and even though it\u2019s been 30 years since I\u2019ve had it, I saw it on sale and thought it would be fun for her to try too. \n\nWell, my daughter ended up not liking them but my husband was very angry that I bought them in the first place. He said some hurtful things and that left me wondering \u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1668387425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yukdxr/aita_for_buying_our_5_year_old_daughter_toaster/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?  Do you want to subject your daughter to this?\n\nSomething needs to change before your daughter is seriously affected.  Either his behavior or your living arrangements.", "unless there's something missing here like, your daughter is a diabetic, letting kids explore and eat different things wont kill them. why do you need your hubby's \"permission\" to do anything? op, is this an abusive relationship? do you need help?", "NTA. But--without getting hyperbolic as can be the tendency of this sub--I'm a little concerned about the way your husband is treating you both. Is he controlling in other aspects of your lives as well? \n\nHe has no right to unilaterally decide what she eats. That's very strange behavior.", "uhhh NTA, but like... why are you allowing your husband to limit your child's diet like this? mac and cheese and chicken fingers are an OK sometimes treat, but they aren't a great day-to-day diet for a child. why do you need *permission* to do anything from him?\n\ni feel like we can all relate to having stuff like pop tarts or toaster strudel because we liked it as kids but grew out of it. ever few years i buy one of those disgusting little debbie christmas tree cakes...", "NTA, it\u2019s not up to him to solely dictate what your child eats, you\u2019re both parents. Also that food had sentimental value to you and was a nice generational thing to try and share.\n\nLimited info but it sounds like your husband wants to paint himself as \u2018the fun one\u2019 in your daughters eyes.", "NTA. You have a major problem with the over controlling husband that consumes a diet worthy of a toddler. Why have you conceded control of food and grocery shopping to this person. I feel sorry for your daughter who could be and probably wants to eat healthy food and is restricted because a grown man eats a toddler diet.", "NTA. Unless there\u2019s a huge missing piece of information (a disease, a food allergy, etc.) your husband is unsettlingly controlling, and wants to have everything his way. He\u2019s the AH in this scenario; he doesn\u2019t get to dictate single-handedly what your kid eats.", "NTA first of all... The fact that you're even on here asking the question though seriously hints at the fact you are in an abusive relationship. You may want to seek professional help, and if you're not \"allowed\" to do that, you should leave.", "NTA except for making me want a Toaster Strudel. I haven't had one since I was a kid. Your husband's behavior is weird and makes me wonder what's going on with him -- it sounds like it might be deeper than just a pastry.\n\nIncidentally for anyone else who was confused, it looks like \"pogos\" are frozen corn dogs.", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t need your husband\u2019s permission to buy a treat for your child.\n\nHe eats garbage food, but complains when you bring one treat home?\n\nHe was probably upset because HE doesn\u2019t like strudel.", "NTA,  but wow - your controlling husband sure is. \n\nYou aren't a hired nanny disobeying what your employer told you to feed their kid - this is *your* child, too.", "NTA\nYou are also her parent, you also get to decide and make choices. Why does he think he can control everything she eats??? Sounds like a red flag, is he controlling in other aspects of her/your life??\nScary", "NTA your husband though sounds like a controlling jerk. That's not a normal reaction and treats only coming from him is trying to create a better bond with him and daughter vs you and daughter I would think. Sounds like counseling is in order really.", "This is beyond AITA. You are NTA but your husband sounds like he has genuine psychological issues. What he is doing is very far from normal.", "\ud83d\udea9What could his reasoning possibly be that only he gets to bring home fun foods? And toaster strudels are delicious.", "NTA husband is abusive poor kid", "NTA. Your husband sounds super weird. His preferred meals aren\u2019t healthy - I can see why someone very concerned with a healthy diet might have strong feelings about toaster strudels, but he eats Mac and cheese and nuggets.", "It is your daughter too.  He isn't the sole parent here.  Having your daughter try new things is the fun part of parenting.  The faces they make can be hilarious. NTA", "NTA, but the way he treats you about this is scary and not normal. I hope you\u2019re viewing your marriage through eyes that are wide open.", "Nta. Could be his need for control means he's afraid to be seen as a bad parent for giving her something unhealthy. Or he's worried she'll gain weight. His diet might not matter but he could be thinking \"I don't want her to be stuck eating what I eat\". I analyse his behaviour to find the root cause, because only then will people change. You need to communicate that one treat now and then is not a big deal and he doesn't need to worry. She's old enough.", "NTA and I\u2019m confused.\n\nWhat\u2019s his reasoning for being the only one who\u2019s able to decide what she eats and why does he feed her so much crap food?", "NTA\n\nI suffer from ptsd. Quite a few bad things happened in my childhood but one thing kind of stands out. My first stepfather was abusive with food. He made me eat things no one else did like fats and gristle. He gave me too much. He didn\u2019t let me eat any snack ever. I remember being in a house across the street.  Was wearing a dress and the neighbors there let me have some nuts. They were on my dress with me in the chair. I heard me stepfather calling me loudly. I jumped up, spilling the nuts all over the floor because I was terrified and ran away.  My mom too, me to a doctor at some point and I remember him diagnosing me with a nervous stomach. I did put two and two together at the time, but now it\u2019s obvious. Luckily it didn\u2019t create any problems with food but any sudden noise makes me jump just like I did that day.", "Why does your husband have the same diet as an unchaperoned middle schooler?", "NTA. Anybody whose diet is mac and cheese, pogos and chicken fingers has no right to control what anyone else eats. He is a control freak and you really need to think if you want to expose yourself and your daughter to this BS.", "Your husband is abusive\u2014and I think he is abusing you in more way than just controlling what you buy. You need to leave.", "NTA but your husband is a control freak to the point it\u2019s detrimental to not only you but your daughter as well. Trying new things is a part of life. \nIt might be time for you to try new things, if you know what I mean. You deserve better, a LOT better.", "NTA hopefully you were wondering why you're with a man who woul say hurtful things over...toaster strudel", "Thank you for the reply. Honestly, no, I don\u2019t want to do this for the rest of my life but he has a good side to him too so it\u2019s not an easy call.", "This made me laugh because those Christmas tree cakes are pretty gross \ud83d\ude06 but I\u2019m also guilty of eating them every few years because I forget how bad they really are. My daughter eats a lot of vegetarian stuff so thankfully she has a good balance of mine and his diets.", "Oh wow, I\u2019ve never looked at it like that! You could be right because any time I buy her a toy or a new treat, it\u2019s a useless waste of money but it\u2019s okay if he does it.", "I\u2019m the one who buys all of the groceries so she does eat mostly healthy stuff, that\u2019s why the toaster strudel was such a problem I guess. But I think she should also get to be a kid. And I agree about his diet being fit for a toddler.", "Oh! I didn\u2019t realize that people wouldn\u2019t know what a pogo is! I\u2019m sorry! I guess it\u2019s a Canadian thing haha", "I said this exact thing to him. I said \u201cI\u2019m her parent too.\u201d And he said \u201cyeah, I know you are.\u201d But he said it with disdain like he hates that I\u2019m her mom and it really cut deep.", "Do you value your own life and freedom as much as you do his? You should. You are worthy of happiness. No one deserves to live like they're walking on eggshells, just for the occasional ray of light that peeks through. There are people who exist who don't make their partners miserable. You're allowed to have that.", "\"Good side\" implies a \"bad side\" to him too. I know people aren't perfect but at some point you have to trust your gut about the people you want influencing and raising your daughter.", "You can make the best sandwich in the world with the finest ingredients, if that sandwich has a bit of dog shit it, it's a shit sandwich. \n\n\n\nYou are just as much of a parent as he is and he's not treating you like an equal at all. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells because of a controlling partner.", "I\u2019m not a fan of processed food (nb I was a very unhealthy vegetarian for 15 years eating lots of unprocessed veggies), but this is ridiculous. You and your husband need to have a serious conversation about control and compromise.  You need to make it clear that you will compromise (so long as he does) but will not be controlled. And let him know that y\u2019all can make these decisions together or you can get divorced and make them separately.", ">he has a good side to him \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make him a good person, a good father, or a good husband. This man is abusive. And lots of abusers get away with abuse because \u201cthey have a good side.\u201d", "Most abusers have good sides, that's one of the ways that they get their victims to stay with them. If you allow your husband to continue to treat your daughter this way at all out of some misguided desire to \"keep the good parts\", you will also be responsible for what happens to her.", "Good for you and your daughter.\n\nWe have a family member that took control of everything that was fed to his son from infancy. His son won't touch a fruit or vegetable and McD nuggets are his favorite meal with a Capri Sun juice box.\n\nToddlers and young children are often times adventurous eaters if they see family members enjoying a wide variety of foods. My grandsons were eating spicy food by 18 months because their father loved it.", "This is abusive. And your daughter will grow up watching it. Be aware.", "what a hurtful reply. I hope you are ok.
