I know one other guy in the chat and there are two I\u2019ve never met before. Now, keep in mind that I have a profile pic of me in armor because I mostly talk to people in my sport and friends who know me already and my name isn\u2019t clearly feminine.

It wasnt right for you all to gang up on Jake. I would've felt very betrayed if I were him. You should've said something right away and just kept it light, and he probably wouldn't have had a problem with it. You might be female, but you can be 'one of the guys' as much as any of them, but you didn't give Jake the chance to realize that. So you and the other guys were all being AHs for setting him up. But Jake also shares AH status. Not for wanting a guy's night (there's nothing wrong with that) or for assuming your gender (we all make assumptions about others out of necessity to fill in information we don't know.

I'm gay but not 'obviously' gay, and most people who don't know just assume I'm straight. On top of that, I'm a Christian and grew up in a traditional, religious family, so I meet a fair amount of church ladies who usually then want to ask about my wife or introduce me to their granddaughters (I do have a husband). It's usually not a big deal, but occasionally, it can be awkward. I've learned that it's always easier and better to be straightforward and upfront about it.
