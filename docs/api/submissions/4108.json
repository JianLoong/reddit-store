It wasnt right for you all to gang up on Jake. I would've felt very betrayed if I were him.

You might be female, but you can be 'one of the guys' as much as any of them, but you didn't give Jake the chance to realize that. So you and the other guys were all being AHs for setting him up. But Jake also shares AH status.

I'm gay but not 'obviously' gay, and most people who don't know just assume I'm straight. On top of that, I'm a Christian and grew up in a traditional, religious family, so I meet a fair amount of church ladies who usually then want to ask about my wife or introduce me to their granddaughters (I do have a husband). It's usually not a big deal, but occasionally, it can be awkward. I've learned that it's always easier and better to be straightforward and upfront about it.
