It makes things fun sometimes because people assume I\u2019m a dude until they meet me in person a lot.  I\u2019m also in a hobby that involves wearing armor and I\u2019m tall, so it\u2019s really hard for  people to tell my gender when my helm is on and it results in some funny reactions sometimes. That\u2019s the background.\n\nSo my friend is planning a D&D game and he added me to a group chat to talk about character creation. I know one other guy in the chat and there are two I\u2019ve never met before. Now, keep in mind that I have a profile pic of me in armor because I mostly talk to people in my sport and friends who know me already and my name isn\u2019t clearly feminine. It becomes apparent that at least one guy \u201cJake\u201d doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019m a girl when someone asks about inviting their girlfriend to play and Jake says \u201ccan we just have a guy\u2019s night? Girls always ruin the vibe of a game.\u201d\n\nOh. Boy.\n\nI see my DM friend typing so I message him and tell him not to tell the guy off because I want to see what happens. DM friend let\u2019s the other two in on it so they won\u2019t spoil the reveal and everyone is getting their popcorn ready.\n\nWe spend another week talking during which time Jake keeps digging the hole deeper and game day comes around. Jake is the last one to show up so I\u2019m sitting there with the other guys and he gives me a slightly annoyed look.\n\n\u201cI thought your gf wasn\u2019t playing,\u201d he says to the guy who asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OP, nice to meet you,\u201d I tell him grinning. \u201cSorry if I ruin the vibe of the game.\u201d\n\nEveryone else laughs, but Jake goes mental and storms out.

It wasnt right for you all to gang up on Jake. I would've felt very betrayed if I were him. You should've said something right away and just kept it light, and he probably wouldn't have had a problem with it. You might be female, but you can be 'one of the guys' as much as any of them, but you didn't give Jake the chance to realize that. So you and the other guys were all being AHs for setting him up. But Jake also shares AH status. Not for wanting a guy's night (there's nothing wrong with that) or for assuming your gender (we all make assumptions about others out of necessity to fill in information we don't know. They're just guesses) but for overreacting and storming out. I hope he calmed down and got over it and you all are able to enjoy your hobby together, but it was you who put that in jeopardy, not Jake. ESH. \n\nI want to add that I understand how awkward it can be to have to change someone's assumption about you when they've made that assumption clear, and especially if they've expressed an opinion over it. I'm gay but not 'obviously' gay, and most people who don't know just assume I'm straight. On top of that, I'm a Christian and grew up in a traditional, religious family, so I meet a fair amount of church ladies who usually then want to ask about my wife or introduce me to their granddaughters (I do have a husband). It's usually not a big deal, but occasionally, it can be awkward. I've learned that it's always easier and better to be straightforward and upfront about it. If they ask, I tell the truth simply and matter-of-factly. No games, no apologies, no BS. It just is what it is, take it or leave it.
