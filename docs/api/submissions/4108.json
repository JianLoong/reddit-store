It wasnt right for you all to gang up on Jake. I would've felt very betrayed if I were him.

You might be female, but you can be 'one of the guys' as much as any of them, but you didn't give Jake the chance to realize that. So you and the other guys were all being AHs for setting him up. But Jake also shares AH status.

I'm gay but not 'obviously' gay, and most people who don't know just assume I'm straight. On top of that, I'm a Christian and grew up in a traditional, religious family, so I meet a fair amount of church ladies who usually then want to ask about my wife or introduce me to their granddaughters (I do have a husband). It's usually not a big deal, but occasionally, it can be awkward. I've learned that it's always easier and better to be straightforward and upfront about it.

He just wasn\u2019t told there was already a girl at the table and threw a fit because his assumption was wrong.  Jake isn\u2019t even friends with any of these people, the only one he had ever met was the DM, it\u2019s not his table and he\u2019s not running the game.  He\u2019s not necessarily wrong to ask, but we decided to troll him because he was being a presumptive bellend.  The girlfriend was also invited whether he liked it or not and will join us next session.\n\nAlso, I exist with a name I was given at birth and in normal protective equipment for my sport and sometimes that results in funny misunderstandings because people make assumptions without me doing anything at all.  Sometimes it\u2019s misogynistic twits who bellyache when they lose against me after the fact but were fine before the armor came off, most of the time it\u2019s stuff like the girl who tied a favor on me in a champions tourney and offered me a kiss if I won, then facepalmed when she heard a female voice come out of my helm and said she had been trying to flirt with me all morning and just realized I was a woman.  It\u2019s not a power trip, it\u2019s just interesting to get to see how people flip behavior when they have to go from \u201cassumed man\u201d to \u201cwoman\u201d.", "She didn\u2019t crash a guys night though. It was a D&D game she was already invited to.", "Are men allowed to be mad when an event not planned to be for men only and which they were told would not be for men only turns out to have a woman there who was in fact invited to the event before he was?

Bc the only reason it was made a prank was bc he made an assumption that he didn't bother to clarify himself. I don't think it should be on other ppl to correct an assumption you made-it should be on you to be aware of that and make steps to avoid it, or be graceful and acknowledge that your own assumptions created a situation that could have been avoided. \n\n>no one likes being the only person in a group who doesn't know something, when everyone else in the group is actively trying to keep that something from you.\n\nI mean, there's a really easy way to avoid that.
