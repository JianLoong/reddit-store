Baby wasn't even crying or anything. The baby went right to sleep and I never took the baby out of the room. So there really wasn't a problem to be had. \n\nMy husband is still on paternity leave and has no early morning obligations to be upset in that regards. \n\nDuring the waking hours my husband is great about taking care of the baby with me. \n\nI feel terrible that he expected me to remove the baby out of our bedroom that we share with the baby, but at the same time feel like I shouldn't.

Even if he were working, even if you were exclusively breastfeeding, I don't see why he should be above waking up and changing some of the nappies over the night so you don't have to don't every single time.

Unbelievable.", "NTA. Maybe you should let him know that he is the dad. He better start acting like one. Paternity leave is not there so that people can sleep more, it is there so parents can spend time with their kids. \n\nI dont know your feeding habits.

As you say, he's on paternity leave and that's not a holiday.

Also babies being backwards in their schedule and up at 2am is totally normal at this age.  Sleep training isn't recommended until 4 months or baby is of a certain weight.  Also, OP knows her baby and what his needs are, some babies just don't sleep and that is no one's fault.  \n\nHusband needs to stop playing \"Paternity means Vacation for new Dads\" and step up and help.  Be it just making sure you have water throughout the night or checking in or heck, I dunno, offering a bottle so maybe you can sleep more than 2 hours at a time.  I get that he's tired of sleeping on the couch but he chose to sleep over helping his wife while recovering from a major medical event and helping his new baby.  The first several months with a new baby are about the family adjusting to a new norm, mom healing, and keeping baby alive.  Dad needs to get on board.  \n\nOp, stay where YOU are comfortable.  Breastfeeding and sleeping in intervals in a place less than comfortable will do a number on your body that it doesn't need right now.", "Just wow! You NTA but your husband is certainly acting like one. This is not how fathers behave, it is not acceptable. \n\nMy husband and I co-slept with our youngest for years because baby just needed more reassurance and love. At one point, when littley was a toddler, we even bought a triple sleeper bunk bed thinking that littley could sleep on the top bunk and still be with us and have that extra comfort. Guess who ended up sleeping in the top bunk?! \ud83d\ude01 Husband didn't mind and we managed to sleep, more or less. Husband slept through most disturbances and I was ok with that because he had to get up for work and I didn't and I breastfed. He pulled his weight when he got home from work and weekends.\n\nLittley had his own bedroom all set up just waiting for him, but he wouldn't, and I didn't push the issue because I knew my child and I knew what he needed. Glad I did it this way because he was diagnosed autistic at 4yrs old. \n\nAnyway, when littley was 5 years old he decided himself that he wanted to sleep in his own room, in his own bed and has done so ever since, no looking back. You can imagine we got rid of that 3 sleeper so darned quick \ud83d\ude01\n\nI wanted to tell you this because parents make sacrifices for their children, not just mothers. It is supposed to be a pertnership. Your husband needs to step up and not be selfish. Enjoy your baby and all the stages that come along.

Can I have tomorrow then? I am pooped! Godspeed.", "YtA for letting your baby stay up til 2am.

He's not supposed to help you in parenting, he's supposed to parent his child.\n\nThe very premise that he helps shows that the parenting equation in your house that you are the parent and he helps when he can, which may have been excusable if he was at work.\n\nHe's supposed to take over the majority of parenting while you're recovering from childbirth since you did the big job of being pregnant and birthing the baby. He isn't entitled to uninterrupted sleep.\n\nWhen I was born, paternity leave wasn't even a th9ng and my dad worked nearly 7 days a week. Yet he managed to wake up at night to give my mom rest.\n\nRaise your standards. My dad isn't even a boomer. He's Gen alpha", "I don't think it means he dosen't care for the baby equally. \nI do think there is some truth that the behavior is a consequence of other actions possibly \ud83e\udd14", "In a few years she's going to say how much it helps when he babysits the kid so she can get other things done. \ud83d\ude44", "Poor baby that sounds like it was rough. \n\nWith our 2nd baby we had which was 8 years ago my husband did primarily everything during the age of 4 weeks old to one year old due to me having to start my full time college program and working between school. \n\nI don't think it is entitled type of mentality. I'm hoping it was just a lapse in judgement when he got upset with me.", "No I didn't ask him, he really didn't give me the chance to. He went back to bed after locking me out of the room.  So here I am on the couch trying reddit out for the first time giving it the go. Waiting for baby to wake for feeding and for him to unlock the door. \n\nI'm definitely going to ask when my husband wakes up for the day.", "NTA. Even if you feel the division of duties is fair currently and it is not a point in this issue at all, a parent is still subject to being woken up by their child, especially an infant. A baby is going to cut into EVERYONE\u2019S sleep, hell even the neighbors might have a rough couple months. It is a very frustrating time and I understand him trying to get some extra sleep in (I\u2019m also kind of an AH though) but unfortunately, that\u2019s not a possibility right now. Have him keep sleeping near the baby, he\u2019ll adjust.", "It is recommended for a baby to sleep in same room as parents for a year to prevent sids.", "Excuse me, but HE LOCKED YOU OUT of the room with nowhere to put the baby down to sleep? This is not ok!!\n\nI am about a week off giving birth myself. If my husband did this to me he had better have a damn good explanation otherwise I'd be locking him out of the house. That is way beyond what being a little cranky or tired can excuse.", "Damn. I hope you guys can talk it out! Wish you all the best stranger:)", "I had already put the baby down in bed in the bedroom when he got up and was upset wanting me to take him out. I never took the baby out because baby went to sleep no issues. He just locked me out of the room when he returned back to the bedroom. \nSo I am locked out of the room while my husband and baby are sleeping in the bedroom. \n\nI agree, there isn't any excuse. I plan to ask him about it when he wakes up and unlocks the door.", "Me too, thank you!", "I see, but not sure separating you and your baby with a locked door when baby is solely reliant on you for feeds is any better to be honest. Locking a partner out of a shared sleeping space should only ever be a last resort (i.e. if you were trying to hurt him or the baby). Besides which if he's only worried about uninterrupted sleep, what is he trying to achieve by locking you out and not the baby? \n\nIf this is truly unusual behaviour for him I would not let it go until you get to the bottom of why he thought it was appropriate to do that to you. Wishing you the best OP!", "I'm sorry but that is outrageous behaviour on his part - he doesn't want the baby sleeping there but has locked you out so you cannot attend to it? Utterly spiteful behaviour.", "I'm hoping he just accidentally locked it."]}
