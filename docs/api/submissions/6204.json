I have personally been around several family members who have quit smoking, and while I am proud of their success with this healthy decision, it was difficult to be around them some days. Smoking becomes an emotional crutch for people when daily stress arises. Take away that crutch, and they have to develop new coping mechanisms which may or may not be pleasant for those around them. OP, I am proud of your decision to quit smoking, this will be healthier for you. Just try to find a healthy coping mechanism for your stress, like exercise or a creative hobby.

That is an understandable worry... But what isn't understandable is broaching it with you in the way that she did, which obviously puts a ton of pressure on you on top of the pressure I'm sure you already face trying to quit, and it is especially not understandable that she'd be dismissive once you said you wanted to discuss what she said more. It is absolutely something that needs to be discussed more, both to keep on top of it since it is such a present worry for her, but also to broach why she would throw that at you so nonchalantly and then to top it off, to be so dismissive when you ask to discuss it more. You are not being sensitive at all wanted to discuss it and it is a red flag that she wants to dismiss it so quickly. She said it, she needs to own it and discuss it, not just call you sensitive and easily offended.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like she's expressing an anxiety so much as issuing a warning. That would be very upsetting to hear.", "Nta.....what she probably meant was that when people quit smoking they get snappy or grumpy miserable because they aren't getting their fix.", "NTA for taking offense but it's a valid concern.\nDid she mean it in a \"you'll be withdrawing and I won't like you\" way or like the people that tell the recovering addict they were more fun during addiction? That's important too, and you need to know what she means. Chances are you'll be a total asshole for at least a couple days, or at least you'll be in an asshole mood. Have you quit smoking before? If you're a daily smoker and you just stop it isn't a great time for a couple days and you'll have to be on top of your moods. You'll have to be aware of the fact that your heightened anxiety is due to your body's lack of marijuana, and acknowledge it'll go away soon. You'll have to find a way to occupy your mind when all you want is to toke. I know it's *only* weed, but if you're a daily smoker for long enough,you basically need to treat this like coming off of any other drug. You gotta detox your body, and then your mind, and you have to try not to be a prick during all of this. You'll need to have lots of discussions with her moving forward or it's gonna be a bad time", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nDoes your wife also smoke weed, and is concerned she won't be able to?\n\nOtherwise, she's being an insulting AH when you're literally looking to improve your own health.", "NTA - that is a HORRIBLE thing for her to say and frankly you deserve a medal for being so mature about it in your approach. For her to now act like what she said was nbd is also just shitty behavior. You're fucking quitting weed and your WIFE is mad about that? That's a sentence I thought could never be true.", "NTA. Your wife doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart and worries about how less of a fun person you will be simply for looking after yourself. She sounds incredibly selfish.", "NTA\n\nShe has basically told you she will no longer like you if you stop \"being fun to be around\" if you quit smoking.\n\nNothing about your health. No praise for the financial thinking.\n\nIt honestly comes across as if she's only with you because you also smoke.\n\n>because it's not a big deal and I'm being too sensitive and I get offended at everything she says.\n\nand that quote there supports it. Ask her to name five things she loves about you that don't involve your smoking or your looks.

I have quit many times but never with the intent to never do it again. I went more than a year without it. But I do have a prescription for it now but barely use it at all. \n\nMaybe if you tell her you\u2019re taking a break she will understand. If you take a break or switch brands it works better again. So maybe you can convince her to do that with you. When the time is up, if you still don\u2019t want to use it, you can say, you know I kind of like the way i few without it. So I\u2019m going to keep doings it.", "NTA \n\nYou're not wrong for feeling hurt about what she said or for how she brushed you off, but quitting a habit DOES take it's toll on a person. I'm not sure if she meant you'd be more dull if you're not smoking or if she meant she's not looking forward to the way you're going to act while you adjust to life without weed. \n\nWhich is why talking about it later is a good idea, and she may not feel like it's a big deal but clarification and communication can only help.", "NTA that was a pretty mean thing to say, as a daily smoker who is married to someone who has quit after many years of smoking, I believe her worries are completely unfounded anyway, smoking cannabis is NOT your personality just something you do.", "NTA because of how she responded.  She didn't want to communicate; she just wanted you to shut up.  Look at the string of nonsense she flung at you:  It's not a big deal (but she said it was earlier); you're too sensitive (but she flat-out said that she might not want to be around HER WIFE anymore); you get offended at everything she says (which in *my* experience is what somebody says when they don't want to communicate, they just want to discharge negative emotions at a target).\n\nDoes she do this often?  It's not a deal-breaker, but it may be a matter for marriage counseling.  \n\nThat said, it's worth unpacking your relationship with weed for your own purposes.  Have you ever used it as a band-aid?  That is, as a way to smooth out your mood when what you really needed was to examine why the mood was happening, and address the issue--but money, but time, but psychological tender spots?  On a less fraught note, is it part of a ritual that you use to tell yourself it's time to relax and kick back, and if so, do you already have a replacement in mind?", "NTA\n\nThat is a horrible thing she told you AND THEN doubled down on that statement by gaslighting you?!\nI do not throw that term around so loosely either. \nYou are not her entertainment, you're her partner. \nYou two NEED to have that talk regardless of how insignificant she thinks it is because to YOU it's not insignificant and that should mean something to her or at least strike a cord to her heart. She is setting her opinions as above yours and of more importance. That will slowly make you smaller and smaller to your own Self.\nAnd what's worse she apparently sees that dynamic as normal and ok now. It's NOT ok. \nTalk, because whatever the outcome is it needs to happen now.\nI've gone through this and the more you back down the harder it will be to heard and change anything. \nShe's in love with the thought of you, not you.

He\u2019s taking it seriously and wanting to talk it over, but she\u2019s being flippant and dismissive.\n\nTo take a similar example, I stopped taking my anti-depressant a while back, and I asked my husband to pay attention to his perception of me and let me know if he noticed anything off. His observations have helped me notice things I wouldn\u2019t have noticed on my own, which has helped me make the right decisions about my medication. What OP is doing right now is very similar to a change in medication, and as his partner, she should be more invested in making sure the change goes smoothly for both of them.

Hopefully they talk more tonight. \n\nI think your story & experiences are really important. Making big changes in life are not easy. Having a partner to lean on & share their perspective is truly important to the outcome. IMO", "Well, this marriage is doomed already. OP wants to drop an unhealthy habit and instead of receiving support, praise and encouragement, he gets \"I am not sure if I'll like you if you do this\"... shm...", "Hey, there\u2019s the middle ground! :-) I agree with everything you just said. I can see that today may not be the right day for it - It makes sense that she would want to focus on other things right now and have the conversation later. It was likely just a thoughtless comment that (hopefully) doesn\u2019t reflect her true feelings about the situation. I do hope that, seeing how her comment affected him, she\u2019ll reassure him that they\u2019ll talk about it later so that he doesn\u2019t go through the entire day stressing about it.", "I agree that the final outcome will probably be the same\u2026But they need to go talk, and now.\n\nSome people don\u2019t like it when others get clean because the power balance changes in the relationship. I have YET to meet a woman who did not want her (edited: partner) to shape up and dedicate more money or resources to the household. This is a very interesting scenario, indeed."]}
