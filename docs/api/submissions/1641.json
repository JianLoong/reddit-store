{"id": 1641, "submission_id": "yo1bk7", "title": "AITA for discouraging my sister from repeating her weird cruel baby shower game?", "selftext": "A few years ago when I (27F) was pregnant my SIL offered to throw my shower. She said my sister \u201cKate\u201d (31F) was organizing the games. Kate doesn\u2019t have or want kids but she loves babies and loves doing party stuff so I trusted her entirely.\n\nShortly into the shower, Kate gave everyone a slip of paper and a pen and broke out a tape measure. She said the game was going to be guessing how big around I was. Which seems like a weird game to begin with, but as Kate knows I\u2019ve struggled with an eating disorder my whole life. In a year my weight can swing 50 pounds, plus I\u2019d gained 45 during pregnancy. Yet for some bizarre reason Kate thought making my 8-months pregnant waistline the center of attention would be \u201cfun\u201d. I was mortified and fighting back tears for the sake of not ruining the party for everyone. I was mortified. If my bestie hadn\u2019t understood what was happening and run right to my side, I\u2019m sure I would have lost it. I was so hurt. I feel like even for a mother-to-be with perfect body image, this would be a disturbing \u201cgame\u201d. I was choking back tears but skate seemed oblivious to that.\n\nI decided not to say anything to her about it after the shower or afterwards. I was saving my energy for my son and it was over so why bother.\n\nYesterday Kate told me she\u2019s organizing a shower for a family friend, so I (nicely, I thought) suggested she skip that \u201cgame\u201d. She was dumbfounded so I explained (again, rather nicely) how I hurt I had been by it, and maybe to skip that game in the future. You never know how an expectant mother is feeling about the changes in their body. She blew up that I was wrong to \u201charbor this rage\u201d at her for all these years, that I was \u201cprojecting my insecurities\u201d onto our friend, and she even suggested I was ungrateful for her helping at my shower. Then she hung up on me.\n\nAm I really TA here? I was just trying to spare our friend the hurt that I felt. I really feel like the whole game is a weird and uncomfortable for everyone there, eating disorder aside. Was I wrong to discourage her from doing it again?", "created_utc": 1667765738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo1bk7/aita_for_discouraging_my_sister_from_repeating/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I'm going to say NTA. It's awful that you went through that... But I would've brought up the incident immediately.\n\nYour sister didn't handle hearing the news that her sister harbored hard feelings for so long very well at all.\n\nDoesn't make her a saint she shouldn't have blown up on your like that, especially since I think that the game is pretty rude too.

She's wrong for being mad at you when she's the one who hurt you.", "NAH - this is actually a relatively normal baby shower game.  It may be regional, but you can even find pre-made measuring tape/string on Amazon.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that it triggered your body issues and I wish your sister took your feelings I to consideration over THIS particular game for YOU. \n\nBut not all mothers would be triggered.", "NTA. It was dumb for your sister to do that game knowing your weight issues. I think you should have told your sister to ask her opinion of the game.

It\u2019s a fairly common game so I don\u2019t think Kate was trying to be mean, but she should have heard you out when you brought up some excellent points about this game.", "NTA.

The guest with the closet length is the winner. No invasion of mommy and its still fun. Anyways your sister is wrong and needs to rethink her party games.", "NTA but she sure is.

Next woman may not be so nice about it at the party.", "NTA, but your sister is.", "NTA. I\u2019m currently pregnant and my mom and sister are planning my baby shower.

I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. \n\nMy sister discussed games with me first before the party. I had to veto some of them.

But I also wish you had said something to her about it sooner. \n\nIt is a fairly common shower game, and while you meant well, your advice about her party planning seems to have been unsolicited, and not necessarily timely,  so I can't fault her for having her feelings hurt, either, especially if you pushed the point.", "NTA\n\nThat is an awful game. I honestly haven\u2019t seen anything like that since the 80\u2019s. Then, it was give all the guests a roll of TP and they had to take off the number of squares they thought would fit the belly. It wasn\u2019t cool then and it is less cool now.", "Well, then I expect there are regional or cultural differences in frequency of baby shower games.", "I'm not sure how much of a reliable narrator you are, because the telling of the sister's reaction feels like there are details missing for her to have that sort of response but I'm going to say NTA. If what you say is all actually true, then it is only a small request not to include that game and an angry response like that from the sis was not justified.", "NTA\n\nYes, you are projecting your feelings on to this other friend of hers, as this is a normal party game at baby showers. \n\nBut it is not an AH thing to tell her that the game could make the mom feel uncomfortable. There are variations on the game, some could be considered more dramatizing than others, depending on the history of the mom. I also know women who are completely different while pregnant. Women who are big huggers are suddenly touch-me-nots, and vise versa. \n\nI've played that game at many baby showers and thought nothing of it, but now I kinda feel like an AH because I never thought to think if the mother would be ok with it or not. But I hate party games in general.", "NTA-  36 years ago they played this game for me.  I hated it but went along with it.  But they used a roll of toilet paper to measure my waist.

Sister should have taken the advice at face value. It is a common game but You're not the only person with the body issues in the world so your points are valid. Sister should have apologized for issues the game caused you even if it was unintentionally.  She could have said that she would take your counsel under advisement.\n\nMy ex SILs did a similar thing at a baby shower they did for me.  It was very stressful and I never said anything. It was over 20 years ago.\nI didn't want to seem ungrateful and didn't know how to stand up for my self.  \nI hope you can work through this with Sister.", "I HATED this game before I had kids and made sure that it wasn\u2019t played at any of my baby showers! NTA- you are absolutely right in terms of feeling self conscious about weight during pregnancy!", "I hate this game. Yes. Let\u2019s guess how big you are!!! No just no. NTA.", "NaH\n\nThis game is played because its how midwives measure the size of the baby for women in mid to late pregnancy. It's not about measuring the woman's 'fatness'. It's more about bump measuring for baby size, for fun.", "NAH, it\u2019s a normal game to play, and it bothered you but doesn\u2019t bother every woman. That being said baby showers are tacky and annoying anyway, so it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re constantly full of drama", "NTA. What pushes it from N-A-H to NTA is Kate's reaction to your feelings and the fact this game was not cleared by you for your own shower ahead of time. From what I've seen in the comments, this is not a game Kate made up, but there are certainly plenty of people that wouldn't feel comfortable playing. This seems like a game that shouldn't be sprung on a pregnant person.", "NTA and her reaction is too over the top to not have some truth in your observation that the game seemed mean.", "NTA, I personally think this is a horrible game. Shall we have a game of guess what odors will cause a morning sickness response and then subject the mother to the smells until she puked?", "ESH.", "I know it as a game, but it's a good lesson that maybe we need to modernize or at least check in with the guest of honor to make sure they approve. She handled you telling her really poorly; I'd have been mortified that I'd hurt you that badly and appreciative of the heads up. NTA.", "Unfortunately this is a very common game in the Midwest United States. Sometimes it's done with string sometimes it's done with pieces of toilet paper to see how far you can get around the belly.\n\n Personally I hate the game and if I ever come down pregnant and someone does that game in my shower I'm stopping it right then and there...\n\nSince you had an eating issue beforehand that made you even more uncomfortable with your body I can see why you would discourage this.\n\n I would talk to the friend that's the shower is now for and find out if they want to have this game. And tell them to tell the person that's putting this party on for them  that they do not want this...\n\nIf the person that's pregnant understands why it makes you uncomfortable they may be willing to admit this game as well\n\nNTA  for discouraging her. Your sister is coming off as one though. And she was one at your baby shower cuz  she knew about your eating disorder...", "NTA why do people think this is an okay game to play. Like pregnant women aren\u2019t hormonal enough let\u2019s point out their weight gain. Of course it\u2019s natural to gain weight during a pregnancy but if they know you have a history of body issues it seems like playing that game is a cruel thing to do to you.", "NAH - I get why this game would be traumatic to people who have had ED and she should\u2019ve kept it in mind when planning yours however, a lot of expecting mothers love it my best friend had this game at her baby shower and we laughed (first time I laughed since I lost my son 2 weeks before this) because my string was exact size because I know her that well. It depends on the person, maybe you should\u2019ve just gently suggested that she make sure the mother to be was okay with it", "NTA - if a game is making you uncomfortable then it\u2019s not a good game to play for your shower, and you were coming from a good place. I will say this is an incredibly common game though. They sell tape measures specifically for it in the baby shower section of the party stores near me.", "The game she played is a very common baby shower game, but definitely inappropriate for someone she knew struggled with an eating disorder. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to mention how it can harm expecting parents even unintentionally though so NTA.", "NTA. My mother in-law did this at the Zoom baby shower she hosted for me. She was so surprised by how big I was. Cool, cool. Thanks so much.", "NTA. What swung this from NAH was the fact that she knew you have struggled with an eating disorder. She really should\u2019ve been more sensitive.", "NAH. This is a normal baby shower game.", "ESH", "NAH I understand why you were upset. It\u2019s LEGITIMATE. It\u2019s an old fashioned decades old baby shower game. I\u2019ve been to showers that did that too. But I think it\u2019s one of those games that should be run by the the mother to be first. For this very reason and because it\u2019s kind of boring IMO. There are better games.", "Never been played at a shower I went to. Don't assume your experience is universal.", "Never played at any I have been to and I have been to far to many", "I\u2019ve been to dozens of baby showers and never seen any variation of this game so maybe it\u2019s a regional thing. But still, she knew my history.", "Wait, what?? I'm European, so babyshowers are not a thing where I'm from. But it's actually a game to guess how fat a pregnant woman has gotten?? Excuse my ignorance, but I don't see the fun of it.\n\nPoor OP. With such a sister, who needs enemies??", "I would have agreed with N A H if it wasn't for the sister blowing up at OP.\nYou are right not everyone might be triggered, but it's good to keep in mind that it might. And it's easy not to see that if it wouldn't bother you personally until someone points it out.", "Maybe that's why I have not patience for baby showers.  I don't care how common that game is, it is NOT normal.", "I was going to comment and say this this is a common game in the Midwest (cut off the amount of ribbon you think would equal the baby belly waistline), and maybe OP just hadn't heard of it if she was from a different region.  \n\nI do see how the game could bother someone with an eating disorder, though.", "My SIL chose to do this silly game--twice--at her baby showers.  Given OP's history, Kate was horribly insensitive, though.", "Yeah I'm in England and I think baby showers are the height of tacky nonsense. The only one I've ever been to has this game so I guess it's somewhat normal", "Never heard of this game or played it when I have attended showers. It\u2019s disgusting to try and guess how big around a pregnant woman is.", "Never heard of his game.  I'd be mortified too.", "Her sister blowing up at her like that for expressing her discomfort at the game makes her an A.", "My one baby shower was put on by a Chinese friend, so it was a full-moon party after the baby was born. No games (thank goodness), just great food, lovely presents and kind friends of all genders. Plus by then we knew what else we actually needed, so the gifts were spot on.", "That\u2019s where she went wrong, it should have been nutella haha.", "Lol do you not have a sister? Sounds right up my sister's alley!", "I can verify this dumb game was around at least 15 years before that. I wonder how old it really is.", "Whoa, there. \"Toxic narcissist\" is more than can be inferred from OP's story.", "How so?", "It\u2019s been played more often than not at baby showers I\u2019ve been to.", "Good for you and your more decent shower experiences. I've never been to a shower that doesn't play some sort of variation of it.\n\nCheapest one is with a roll of toilet paper, each participant cuts the length they think will go around the pregnant person, then take turns testing it, most accurate one wins.", "That's why I'm standing by NTA, I do think people need to check-in about games so no one's made uncomfortable, not everyone's gonna have the same triggers and boundaries.", "Right? \nThe thought of that measuring thing around my body in front of a party, and everyone looking at my body during the whole game...\ni'm from Europe too, i thought i was beautiful during my pregnancies but no thanks. \nNo fun at all.", "We used to do it with toilet paper squares, you would guess how many squares, so there wasn't really a hard measurement involved (which I do think could be kind of triggering). No one really remembers from one shower to the next how many squares someone was cause it's not a real measurement, it was much more playful than malicious.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not an unusual game.   I mean, there are people who take monthly belly pictures or even plaster models.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s not done to point out how fat the woman has become but how big the baby has grown.", "Very common game (I\u2019m AUS). Each guest guesses how round the tummy is and cuts the string. At the end you take each string and wrap it around the pregnant woman and see who got closest. \n\nI found it hilarious, everyone (except a few) went overboard and you could loop the string around me twice. All in good fun. I never had an eating disorder though.", "I'm from England and I can happily say that the premise isn't to guess \"how fat\" the woman has become, she probably didn't get ANY \"fatter\" at all, having to eat for two, its to celebrate the state of \"change \" pregnancy represents and has been *relatively* common all over the world in different forms for decades at least.", "It's not how fat.its baby bump measuring. In fact for pregnant women further on its done by the midwife to assess baby size. That's what the game is about", "It sounds appaling. I was feeling sensitive about my body at that stage too and I feel fairly positive about myself usually!", "A lot of shower \"games\" are basically hazing.  They can actually be fun if your guests are people you trust enough to joke/tease and not pile on too hard, but a lot of them sound a little mean if you describe them.  My BFF didn't do any like this to me (I'm overweight and she is petite and smart enough to no got there) but we did have to sample baby food while blindfolded and some of the flavors were NOT good", "Yep, we always did it with toilet paper!", "Yeah, even though this was a common game, we really need to learn to check in with people before putting them on the spot,  especially about their bodies smh. \n\n\nSounds like sis was mortified to hear that OP was hurt by her actions and is trying to distance herself by saying the responsibly was on OP to say she was hurt. Not the most adaptive strategy on her part but not openly malicious,  just kinda immature.", "Even without an eating disorder (which makes it awful), not every woman feels the same about all the body changes. At around 8 months,  I couldn't see my bellybutton, it traumatised me. A friend's bellybutton popped, made her cry. A cousin hates that she needs help even getting plates because of the belly. \n\nIt might be fun IF expectant mum is on the joke. As a surprise? Sounds like a cruel prank", "Yeah, except different people do put on variable amounts of fat while pregnant, and it's one of the many measures by which women can be judged when they're pregnant, so it being common doesn't stop it being super unpleasant for a number of pregnant people.", "It's not how fat.its baby bump measuring. In fact for pregnant women further on its done by the midwife to assess baby size. That's what the game is about", "Yeah I would've loved this game personally, but only cuz I've aways been crazy thin my whole life, so when I started showing I was really excited and proud, I loved every pound I gained", "Then it's on Kate for not asking, but thats a mistake, not an AH move, and OP or the friend she claimed noticed Could have just refused.", "Cool. For a variety of reasons, the expectant mother may not be comfortable with that. Her discomfort should not be necessary for a party game. There are other, more fun, games.", "Kate is not my midwife.", "I'm not saying any different. I'm just replying that this is a party game grounded in legitimate roots not just a mean joke/prank to shame OP and her weight. It's a well known way of measuring baby that was adapted into a baby shower game.", "Obviously but the point is it's not about kate being mean and wanting to measure how fat you are or not. It's a common party game with roots grounded in measuring the baby. That's what i was trying to express. It's not just some random thought out game/prank to try to shame you"]}
