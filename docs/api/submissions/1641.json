{"id": 1641, "submission_id": "yo1bk7", "title": "AITA for discouraging my sister from repeating her weird cruel baby shower game?", "selftext": "A few years ago when I (27F) was pregnant my SIL offered to throw my shower. She said my sister \u201cKate\u201d (31F) was organizing the games. Kate doesn\u2019t have or want kids but she loves babies and loves doing party stuff so I trusted her entirely.\n\nShortly into the shower, Kate gave everyone a slip of paper and a pen and broke out a tape measure. She said the game was going to be guessing how big around I was. Which seems like a weird game to begin with, but as Kate knows I\u2019ve struggled with an eating disorder my whole life. In a year my weight can swing 50 pounds, plus I\u2019d gained 45 during pregnancy. Yet for some bizarre reason Kate thought making my 8-months pregnant waistline the center of attention would be \u201cfun\u201d. I was mortified and fighting back tears for the sake of not ruining the party for everyone. I was mortified. If my bestie hadn\u2019t understood what was happening and run right to my side, I\u2019m sure I would have lost it. I was so hurt. I feel like even for a mother-to-be with perfect body image, this would be a disturbing \u201cgame\u201d. I was choking back tears but skate seemed oblivious to that.\n\nI decided not to say anything to her about it after the shower or afterwards. I was saving my energy for my son and it was over so why bother.\n\nYesterday Kate told me she\u2019s organizing a shower for a family friend, so I (nicely, I thought) suggested she skip that \u201cgame\u201d. She was dumbfounded so I explained (again, rather nicely) how I hurt I had been by it, and maybe to skip that game in the future. You never know how an expectant mother is feeling about the changes in their body. She blew up that I was wrong to \u201charbor this rage\u201d at her for all these years, that I was \u201cprojecting my insecurities\u201d onto our friend, and she even suggested I was ungrateful for her helping at my shower. Then she hung up on me.\n\nAm I really TA here? I was just trying to spare our friend the hurt that I felt. I really feel like the whole game is a weird and uncomfortable for everyone there, eating disorder aside. Was I wrong to discourage her from doing it again?\n\nETA: to clarify, there was nothing medical about this \u201cgame.\u201d That\u2019s not even how doctors/midwives measure you. And I couldn\u2019t have said anything beforehand, I was literally on stage in front of our entire family and all our friends when Kate dropped it on me. I\u2019ve never even heard of this before or after, so it\u2019s not a local custom. And not that it matters but I didn\u2019t feel \u201cfat,\u201d I had fought hard for every single pound on me. I spent my whole life trying to make my rather severe malnutrition NOT be the topic of conversation. It shouldn\u2019t matter if I felt I was too fat or too skinny: there was a emotionally intense medical reason and Kate knows that.", "created_utc": 1667765738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo1bk7/aita_for_discouraging_my_sister_from_repeating/", "score": 2381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The guest with the closet length is the winner. No invasion of mommy and its still fun. Anyways your sister is wrong and needs to rethink her party games.", "NTA but she sure is.

There are variations on the game, some could be considered more dramatizing than others, depending on the history of the mom. I also know women who are completely different while pregnant. Women who are big huggers are suddenly touch-me-nots, and vise versa. \n\nI've played that game at many baby showers and thought nothing of it, but now I kinda feel like an AH because I never thought to think if the mother would be ok with it or not.

NTA.", "NaH\n\nThis game is played because its how midwives measure the size of the baby for women in mid to late pregnancy. It's not about measuring the woman's 'fatness'. It's more about bump measuring for baby size, for fun.", "NAH, it\u2019s a normal game to play, and it bothered you but doesn\u2019t bother every woman. That being said baby showers are tacky and annoying anyway, so it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re constantly full of drama", "NTA. What pushes it from N-A-H to NTA is Kate's reaction to your feelings and the fact this game was not cleared by you for your own shower ahead of time. From what I've seen in the comments, this is not a game Kate made up, but there are certainly plenty of people that wouldn't feel comfortable playing. This seems like a game that shouldn't be sprung on a pregnant person.", "NTA and her reaction is too over the top to not have some truth in your observation that the game seemed mean.", "NTA, I personally think this is a horrible game.

And tell them to tell the person that's putting this party on for them  that they do not want this...\n\nIf the person that's pregnant understands why it makes you uncomfortable they may be willing to admit this game as well\n\nNTA  for discouraging her. Your sister is coming off as one though. And she was one at your baby shower cuz  she knew about your eating disorder...", "NTA why do people think this is an okay game to play. Like pregnant women aren\u2019t hormonal enough let\u2019s point out their weight gain. Of course it\u2019s natural to gain weight during a pregnancy but if they know you have a history of body issues it seems like playing that game is a cruel thing to do to you.", "NAH - I get why this game would be traumatic to people who have had ED and she should\u2019ve kept it in mind when planning yours however, a lot of expecting mothers love it my best friend had this game at her baby shower and we laughed (first time I laughed since I lost my son 2 weeks before this) because my string was exact size because I know her that well. It depends on the person, maybe you should\u2019ve just gently suggested that she make sure the mother to be was okay with it", "NTA - if a game is making you uncomfortable then it\u2019s not a good game to play for your shower, and you were coming from a good place. I will say this is an incredibly common game though. They sell tape measures specifically for it in the baby shower section of the party stores near me.", "The game she played is a very common baby shower game, but definitely inappropriate for someone she knew struggled with an eating disorder.

I don't care how common that game is, it is NOT normal.", "I was going to comment and say this this is a common game in the Midwest (cut off the amount of ribbon you think would equal the baby belly waistline), and maybe OP just hadn't heard of it if she was from a different region.  \n\nI do see how the game could bother someone with an eating disorder, though.", "My SIL chose to do this silly game--twice--at her baby showers.  Given OP's history, Kate was horribly insensitive, though.", "Yeah I'm in England and I think baby showers are the height of tacky nonsense.

I'd be mortified too.", "Her sister blowing up at her like that for expressing her discomfort at the game makes her an A.", "My one baby shower was put on by a Chinese friend, so it was a full-moon party after the baby was born.

I've never been to a shower that doesn't play some sort of variation of it.\n\nCheapest one is with a roll of toilet paper, each participant cuts the length they think will go around the pregnant person, then take turns testing it, most accurate one wins.", "That's why I'm standing by NTA, I do think people need to check-in about games so no one's made uncomfortable, not everyone's gonna have the same triggers and boundaries.", "Right? \nThe thought of that measuring thing around my body in front of a party, and everyone looking at my body during the whole game...\ni'm from Europe too, i thought i was beautiful during my pregnancies but no thanks. \nNo fun at all.", "We used to do it with toilet paper squares, you would guess how many squares, so there wasn't really a hard measurement involved (which I do think could be kind of triggering). No one really remembers from one shower to the next how many squares someone was cause it's not a real measurement, it was much more playful than malicious.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not an unusual game.   I mean, there are people who take monthly belly pictures or even plaster models.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s not done to point out how fat the woman has become but how big the baby has grown.", "Very common game (I\u2019m AUS). Each guest guesses how round the tummy is and cuts the string. At the end you take each string and wrap it around the pregnant woman and see who got closest. \n\nI found it hilarious, everyone (except a few) went overboard and you could loop the string around me twice. All in good fun. I never had an eating disorder though.", "I'm from England and I can happily say that the premise isn't to guess \"how fat\" the woman has become, she probably didn't get ANY \"fatter\" at all, having to eat for two, its to celebrate the state of \"change \" pregnancy represents and has been *relatively* common all over the world in different forms for decades at least.", "It's not how fat.its baby bump measuring.

I was feeling sensitive about my body at that stage too and I feel fairly positive about myself usually!", "A lot of shower \"games\" are basically hazing.  They can actually be fun if your guests are people you trust enough to joke/tease and not pile on too hard, but a lot of them sound a little mean if you describe them.

Not the most adaptive strategy on her part but not openly malicious,  just kinda immature.", "Even without an eating disorder (which makes it awful), not every woman feels the same about all the body changes. At around 8 months,  I couldn't see my bellybutton, it traumatised me. A friend's bellybutton popped, made her cry. A cousin hates that she needs help even getting plates because of the belly. \n\nIt might be fun IF expectant mum is on the joke. As a surprise? Sounds like a cruel prank", "Yeah, except different people do put on variable amounts of fat while pregnant, and it's one of the many measures by which women can be judged when they're pregnant, so it being common doesn't stop it being super unpleasant for a number of pregnant people.", "It's not how fat.its baby bump measuring. In fact for pregnant women further on its done by the midwife to assess baby size.

For a variety of reasons, the expectant mother may not be comfortable with that. Her discomfort should not be necessary for a party game. There are other, more fun, games.", "Kate is not my midwife.", "I'm not saying any different. I'm just replying that this is a party game grounded in legitimate roots not just a mean joke/prank to shame OP and her weight. It's a well known way of measuring baby that was adapted into a baby shower game.", "Obviously but the point is it's not about kate being mean and wanting to measure how fat you are or not. It's a common party game with roots grounded in measuring the baby. That's what i was trying to express. It's not just some random thought out game/prank to try to shame you", "NTA\u2026for your feelings, but those are your feelings.  This is actually one of the most popular games people play at showers.  It\u2019s a fact, that when pregnant, the belly will grow, because their is a tiny human inside.  Really has nothing to do with anyone\u2019s weight.  And yes, in America, it is a common game played at baby showers.", "NAH. I've played this game at every baby shower I've been to, or a variation on it. Having suffered from eating disorders myself I can definitely see why it affected you, but I'm also acutely aware that those around us, even those closest to us who know our pasts, often won't realise things that might affect us, thinking of it as a past issue whereas it is something that stays with us forever even if under control. Your sister didn't mean to be cruel, she just didn't think of a pregnancy belly as anything related to an eating disorder.", "It's so interesting to hear from people around the world (presumably) on issues like this. I can honestly say that I have played this game at no fewer than a dozen different showers - including my own - and it **never** once occurred to me that it would be taken as anything other than fun...and I gained 80 lbs. with my first child so if anyone had a reason to feel body conscious, it would have been me\ud83d\ude02 I actually just played the toilet paper version at my niece's shower three weekends ago. This post has given me so much to think about, and especially to consider if I'm ever again tasked with helping plan a shower...\n\nNAH, but Reddit is out here expanding my worldview!\n\nETA, since I'm seeing questions about where this is a popular game: I'm in Southern California, but I've played it at a shower on the East Coast of the US as well.", "NTA!!!! Horrible game, and you're right to try and prevent others from going through a hurtful experience.", "NAH I did this at my own baby shower, but we never used a measuring tape. People just cut some yarn to make a guess. Then the closest piece of yarn won. I can understand how bringing a measuring tape into it would be upsetting, but without the numbers, I thought it was a fun & silly game.", "TIL this is apparently a normal game that hasn't been played at any baby showers I've been to or heard of", "I don't think I've been to a baby shower in the last 10 years that didn't play that game! NAH", "Maybe it's not common wherever you are, but where I grew up (Southern CA) it is a very common game. People use all kinds of funny items to indicate the width of the mom's baby belly. Also, in several cultures, having a large baby belly is an indication of a healthy baby and is very celebrated. Is there any reason why you think she would hurt you on purpose? It sounds like you need to have a talk and hopefully work this out. Best of luck.", "NTA, I think your sister\u2019s defensiveness is because, like many people mentioned, this is a common place game in the US. It doesn\u2019t feel good to be told that what you\u2019re doing is hurtful, when I\u2019m your eyes it\u2019s standard practice.\n\nThat being said, there are many invasive practices that pregnant people have had to put up with in the name of tradition that can be harmful for a number of reasons. Touching their stomach without permission, learning the sex of the baby, having family in the room during the birth, etc. as a society we need to do a lot better about viewing pregnant people as autonomous beings with boundaries and preferences. \n\nHopefully once your sister has a chance to process she\u2019ll realize that. You\u2019re completely justified in bringing up your concerns and if she really cares about her friends comfort she\u2019ll take it seriously", "NTA I am not familiar with this game or ever heard of this game. Then again, I am Caribbean, so maybe this is not played amongst our group of people. But from your explanation, games like this can be a bit weird, and a touchy subject for some. But to each their own if you\u2019re comfortable. \n\nYou mentioned your sister is aware of previous struggles you\u2019ve experienced so her picking this game was a bit insensitive on her part. You tried to be a good sport about it. You were right to bring it up with her, situations like this it\u2019s best to be more mindful of others, and what they are experiencing during pregnancy. Everyone is different that\u2019s true, but she could\u2019ve taken the criticism and not blow up on you, IMO that makes her the AH. This would\u2019ve been a good opportunity for her to realize that she hurt you and apologize for not realizing this game was not the best choice for you and move on.", "HARD NTA.\n\nYes this is a common game but the fact that your sister KNOWS that you struggle with ED should have been a clue to opt for something much less body image centered.

It's a stupid game, and you very gently told her how it might be hurtful.\n\nThe fact that she completely blew up means that she *knows* it is a bad idea. People who get really offended, rather than listen and consider, already have a feeling that what they are doing is wrong, and that's why they get defensive.", "NTA. I'd go N A H were it not the fact that Kate knows about your struggle. I've gone to baby showers where you're given a streamer or toilet paper to guess how big around the pregnant belly is. But the games should be chosen to not hurt the mother.", "Super common game at baby showers in NZ. But NTA, I definitely wouldn't organise it if I knew the mum had an Ed or was self conscious about her bump.

It will blow up in her face eventually", "Nta. Maybe check with mom first before doing.  Some people are more sensitive about their changing bodies than others.  I get this a common game but but the mom feelings are important too. Besides there are other games like the clothespin game.

I blew thinking someone else had blown it and they got my clothespin.", "No your not, after what she put you though you actually tried to help her an someone else, she's got mad because she finally got told the truth of what she did an did not like hearing it", " NTA and for all those saying this is a normal baby shower game, it\u2019s time it stopped. \n\nWake up to your internalised misogyny, respect yourselves and your friends and just kick this shitty game into the bin where it belongs.", "NTA.

I threatened a full on pregnancy rage fit if someone even tried to play it at my shower though. Pregnancy is hard and effects everyone differently. I had trouble gaining weight at the beginning of mine because of an eating disorder too and almost miscarried. I stopped having my weight said aloud at my appointments and ate when I was hungry for the babies health so if someone had even tried that game I\u2019d have lost it.

I think, however, that you should have talked about this with her sooner.", "NAH you are projecting. You had an ED so you\u2019re insecure. The measure the bump is a standard shower game.

That sounds like a terrible game.  What was she thinking?  Hopefully the two of you can get over it.", "NTA.  You were upset at the game.

Give me snacks and cake and open your gifts so we can go home.", "NTA.\n\nI agree. This game is horrible. I had my shower a month ago and specifically told the host to not have this game.

I could see the game not being for everyone. When we did a version of it at my baby shower I never felt like anyone was guessing how fat I was but how big my baby was.", "NTA. This seemingly common game is a novum for me. I can understand traditions and people keeping them - It\u2019s fun. But what a weird game! How stupid, there are funnier games to celebrate new life, where everyone has a good time.

Why do people forget pregnant women are PEOPLE TOO???", "You are so NTA. Whoever planned my cousin's shower made us play this game and I thought it was the most bizarre thing.

Chugging beer through a baby bottle however is another story.", "NAH\n\nCommenting from Australia. \n\nIt's definitely a common baby shower game here too. Was played at my baby shower. I've always had body image issues but it honestly didn't bother me. I didn't really relate the size of my pregnant belly to weight gain. Just a growing bub\n\nHowever I can see how it could be problematic and the sister should definitely have gotten game approval from OP first given her history", "I\u2019m going with NAH. I\u2019m from the Uk and this is a pretty common game to play at the baby showers I\u2019ve been to. All the showers I\u2019ve been to (and organised) though have always specified that we\u2019re measuring \u201cthe bump\u201d not the mum. We\u2019re not passing comment on her weight as my group of friends have enough mothers in our group by now to know that the size of the mum doesn\u2019t always have any bearing on weight gain during the pregnancy, I have known mothers that are bigger pre-pregnancy that have relatively small bumps compared to petite women that have quite big babies/bumps.\n\nSounds like the main issue here is that your weight and weight gain was a sensitive issue for you, not sure if your sister was aware of this before your shower but definitely is a breakdown of communication there. I would never have done this game if none of the mothers to be weren\u2019t on board with it beforehand. It sounds like communication between the both of you in general isn\u2019t the best if she can\u2019t blow up at you so easily. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t intentionally mean to upset you by doing this game, I remember when I organised my sisters baby shower and was stuck for game ideas it was literally the first one that came up on Google! I hope you can have an adult discussion with her soon about how it hurt you when cooler heads have prevailed but also know that just because you had a problem with it, doesn\u2019t mean that other expectant mothers will. Good luck!", "Thought I was going crazy this is literally my family\u2019s favorite game and usually the best gift to win come with it. Lol we\u2019ve used tape measures.

Your sister really should have considered this knowing you and the fact that when you talked to about it she doubled down instead of apologising for unintentionally hurting you is telling.", "NTA. You're asking her to think before she acts because many women would feel the same as you did (me included). It's certainly the least she can do, to be respectful and conscious of the expectant mother. If the mother is fine with it, cool. But at least she should be checking/asking if it's okay by that mom first.", "Tell the family friend. Ask her if she will want to play it.", "I played this once when I was about 17. It was my best friend's older sister's shower. We were instructed to cut a piece of string that would go around her waist; mine went almost twice around her and she burst into tears. I've never played this game again. I've hosted several showers since then and I will not even prepare for this cruel game. NTA", "NTA. Maybe if the units were funny. How many stupid ideas of mine does it take to reach around her tummy?  \n\nDo not take this serious in any way, PLEASE!", "NTA. I don\u2019t think Kate was originally an AH for doing this game. As others have pointed out it\u2019s common for baby showers. I\u2019ve typically seen it with guessing how many pieces of toilet paper it would take to wrap around the pregnant woman. I believe the original idea  was to make the women have fun with their growing bellies and celebrate the health of the unborn child.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s probably a tradition to retire in general because I know a lot of women who hate it. And Kate could probably have predicted that OP would be uncomfortable given her history.\n\nI also think Kate is definitely an AH for her reaction to OP\u2019s suggestion to drop the game.\n\nBtw, we should probably also drop the game where things are put in diapers and people have to guess what they are. I did that at a shower I hosted and everyone was grossed out", "NTA - This is an extremely common baby shower game.  I wouldn't say it's been at every baby shower I've been to, but I know I've played it a number of times. I've even seen it on lists of baby shower games to play online.  It's not usually done with a tape measure in my experience, but more often with everyone cutting a length of string, yarn or ribbon and whomever is the closest is the winner.  I've never found anyone to be bothered by it, but then to my knowledge, none of the mothers to be that I've had the opportunity to go their showers have had serious body image issues or eating disorders. \n\nYour sister should have known better than to do that knowing your history of disordered eating, but it's possible it just didn't occur to her, especially if she's played it at other showers.  Now that you've pointed out that it's a problem, she's probably feeling guilty, but she handled it badly and lashed out at the person who made her feel bad.  That was not right of her to do, definitely an AH move, but she was likely caught off guard by the criticism.  You didn't do anything wrong by bringing it up, especially since you were trying to keep someone else from being hurt in the same way you were. Give her some space for a bit, and then talk to her again.  I'm sure this can be mended.  \n\nAs far as the friend is concerned, run the proposed games by her and see what she says.  All of them, not just the measurement game.  One never knows what another person is going to be put off by.  That way, if there's a game that makes mom uncomfortable, you excise it from the party before it's a problem.", "They played this at my baby shower too. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about it, but I guess it\u2019s a fairly common game", "NTA.  If that had been at a baby shower for me, I would have left.", "Nta but it\u2019s a normal baby shower game I was at one yesterday that did it no issues", "NTA.  I\u2019ve always thought it was a weird tradition and I think I\u2019ve been to maybe one or two baby showers ever where it wasn\u2019t done.  If I ever have kids myself I\u2019ll definitely be skipping this one at mine.", "NTA. Just because this game is common doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok. I have 4 kids. I only had one big shower (before baby 1), and I would have been a mess if they\u2019d tried to play this game. I had hyperemesis and lost SO much weight during my first pregnancy, and I was really sensitive about my size, even though it was because I was so little. \n\nBottom line: unless the non-preggo people are also prepared for their waistlines to be measured and scrutinized, this game is stupid and outdated and should just not be a thing anymore.", "NTA.  Your sister is.", "NTA, I'm 26 weeks pregnant right now and I would dread this game. Thank God my MIL and sister totally understand where I'm coming from and also find it tacky.\n\nI have never felt so insecure about my body before and to have to do this in front of all my friends and family would be down right horrifying. I would maybe let said friend know of the game and see their thoughts about it?", "NAH. I refused to do that game at my shower, but I made it very clear beforehand. I don't think your sister was trying to be malicious. You should have politely declined to play. Maybe mention the game to the friend to see if she's on board..?", "NTA\n\nWhy not make a game called how long will her childfree status last until she changes her mind and see how she likes it?

I've never heard of this game at a baby shower. What a horrible game. I would also recommend not playing this game. My daughter is going to have a baby shower in the spring. If my co-planner suggests such a game we're going to have the same talk, except I would be telling her she's the ah. You did fine to not rock the boat at the time and then attempt to help another mom to be at a later date not feel the same way. I mean, at least ask the new mom if it's ok before making her size a focal point of a game. I know my daughter would not be ok with this game.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t like it and that\u2019s very understandable.

Im actually shocked at the number of people who havent heard of this game, or think it is somehow disrespectful. Truly shocked.", "NTA.

They may be right about how common the game is, but that doesn't make it any more right or justified. \n\nThat game is HURTFUL and I don't know one pregnant woman who has had it played at her shower who hasn't been at least somewhat bothered by it. \n\nI've planned more baby showers than I can even begin to count, and I always ask the mom-to-be her opinion about games at the shower - not to ask her to pick them, but mostly if there are any she'd prefer me to avoid. Without fail, every last one of them have said the size/tape measure game is a hard pass, to the point that in recent years, I start out by assuring mom-to-be that this game is already off the table and that has been met by nothing but relief. \n\nIt would be considered beyond rude to go up to a non-pregnant woman and start measuring her waist/guessing her measurements, so why is it okay to do this to a pregnant woman? \n\nIt isn't.

It's totally understandable! You didn't feel the emotional awareness/confidence during your own baby shower to express your discomfort with the game. I imagine you are well practiced in enduring your own discomfort for the sake of other's comfort (or what you *think* is their comfort). The thing is that when you do that you deny those who love you most an opportunity to comfort and help you when you could really use it. Instead of expressing your very understandable preference to not be measured like a steer before slaughter -- you *endured* it and even avoided trying to repair that relationship after rather than confront her. She got defensive and that's a lousy way to react but in her world your hurt over the game probably is coming out of nowhere. Give her a beat and sit with how it made you feel for a bit. It really helps to check back in on triggers once you're in a safe headspace. What would you have wanted at your baby shower? How does your bff support you in ways others can't?

VA USA.", "I'm from the US (the South), and I've never heard of this game. I'd hate to think we have a better lock on manners.", "I don't have body insecurities and I absolutely refused to play is at my baby shower. I told everyone I'd be willing to play the game if everyone else was willing to have play as well and have their waists measured. Surprisingly no one else wanted to play. /S", "I had an eating disorder, I used the string for my baby shower game. BUT I was the one who suggested it and we did it as a joke because I was almost as wide as I am tall. Everyone was very polite about it and either cheated with my mom and husband behind my back, or went way bigger than I really was.\nIf anyone pulled that game with me unaware I would have not been as polite as you were. I would have left and had the person closest to me say what happened and then drive me home.", "that\u2019s not really true, even at the doctor they measure your stomach to see how big the baby is so the game most likely came about bc of that", "This is how it should be. Obviously pushing a thin body image for women has now interfered with the idea of a  healthy body for the baby and many women here seem ashamed of their baby growing body shape, even calling it \" being fat\". I find that sad and disturbing.", "hopefully that means you've been playing games that are more fun. my favorite game at the last baby shower i went to was finding hidden baby socks throughout the party. sadly, i lost in a tie breaker.", "People are the worst and need to STFU regarding other people's bodies. I'm sorry you went through that.", "I refused any and all games at my baby shower,  I just wanted everyone to eat cake, drink punch, and socialize! I abhor those games!!", "Why would the sister deserve an opportunity to make amends? OP has suffered from an eating disorder her whole life. Sister has to be either willfully cruel or a half-roasted chestnut to think it\u2019s appropriate to force OP to be measured in front of an audience, common game (that I\u2019ve never heard of) or not.  I have a long history of anorexia and there is not a snowball\u2019s chance hell my sister would ever consider doing this to me.", "Just because she never mentioned it doesn\u2019t mean she carried it around for years. She didn\u2019t say for sure in the post but it sounds like she just forgave her without asking for an apology. At least she moved past it. She only brought it up now to spare someone else because her sister is planning a baby shower. Just because you remember something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re holding a grudge. \n\nHer sister is the asshole for blowing up at her like that since she just nicely suggested not doing it. I\u2019d also be willing to bet her sister would have blown up at her as opposed to apologizing if she\u2019d mentioned it at the time.", "From US of A and it is very common where I am from. Just did it at my friend's shower with string. She got laughs at how big the kids were, but unless you know it is a joke most don't like it.", "Yeah neither I nor my partner would have allowed it to happen at our baby shower, probably a \"what the f*?\" followed by \"no f*cking way\"", "That's a great comeback! When I was pregnant, I decided if anyone touched my belly without permission, I was going to touch theirs. \n\nAlso, I hate that game and don't participate at other people's showers, and would not let it be done at mine.", "We just did this game at my daughters shower, at her request. Most people measured their own waist to make their guess and wound up being way too big. It was hilarious.", "I would've been so upset! Lol of course when I was upset I threw up uncontrollably whole pregnant so the sister would have been wearing some justice juice for putting me through something so humiliating!", "I loved this game! And then comparing how much bigger I got with my daughter than my son was interesting, considering she actually weighed less than my son.\n\nI almost reached 200lb with my daughter\u2019s pregnancy and with my son I was 163lb at the time of birth so it was a huge difference in weight and belly size, but daughter was 5oz  and 1in smaller", "Some bellybuttons \u201cpop out\u201d like a turkey timer. Mine did & I covered it with bandaids.", "They measure the height of your uterus. Not how big your stomach is going around.", "One, it isn't your stomach. You think you swallow instead of spit and the baby grows in your stomach?\n\nTwo, they do not measure you like that, they do not measure AROUND. That's ridiculous. Don't talk like you have any idea what is going on -- they measure from the public bone to the top of the uterus. So the game did NOT come out from that. Just stop it already.", "So you're saying the pregnant woman keeps up with that, gives it to the person running the shower, then they compare?\n\nHonestly,  that just sounds dumb and unnecessarily irrelevant.  \n\nThe point of the \"game\" is to see how large the mother is.", "We play this game where I live on Ontario, Canada.", "I didn\u2019t have games at mine either.  I though we\u2019d collectively outgrown baby shower games.", "I didn\u2019t have games at my baby shower either. It was a scrapbooking party with delicious food to eat and a squishy baby to pass around. It was perfect!", "That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. You just have to be so wholly out of the picture, so socially inept to think \u201cyeah the women with the eating disorder wants to have her body measured and the measurement told to a bunch of people, in front of a bunch of people\u201d. Either the sister is painfully dim or malicious", "I bet you're super fun to hang out with.", "I live in New England and it\u2019s common baby shower game here. At the ones I\u2019ve been to, the Mother to be had fun with it and stuff. However, I can totally see how it could be invasive for some people!", "Also California and I've never even *heard* of this game, let alone played it", "California here and I have seen that game many times. Thankfully games seem to be losing favor at a lot of showers.", "Let me guess, it's common in the South.", "Yeah I'm in Aust and I've played this multiple times at baby showers but it's always string where you try to match the length. Actual measurement never comes into it. I've never known anyone to be upset about that because it's not about the size it's about matching the string.", "Right, it\u2019s done with string/yarn. No tape measure!  The guest cuts yarn to how big around the belly is. Closest wins.", "The tape is a new thing. Places like Amazon and party stores sell measuring tape crepe paper in baby shower colors for the specific purpose of this game. \n\nI don't remember the tape being size accurate though. Like there's not numbers on it, at least not on the kind I've seen used recently.", "Justice juice has me ROLLING but that sounds awful I\u2019m sorry that happened to you", "idk maybe everyone has different views on it, personally i took a picture every couple weeks to see how big my stomach got bc i knew that my stomach got bigger because my baby was getting bigger i feel like that was just the natural connection my brain made but everyone experiences different things during pregnancy", "i\u2019m from the US and i have never once heard of this game. i am genuinely shocked it\u2019s a thing", "I live in the south and have seen it at every baby shower I've been to, including my own.", "Southern east coast, and I\u2019ve seen it done at showers. I thought it was common (though I\u2019ve always had an issue with it).", "I like to hang out with people with empathy", "My Michigan grandma thew me a baby shower and we played this game (25 years ago) so maybe it is regional.  I didn\u2019t think anything about it at the time, but in retrospect can see how it would be upsetting to people.", "Definitely not a Midwestern thing, thank God.", "Idk. I'm from the south and I've never heard of it..", "Southerner here, and I\u2019ve never heard of this terrible game until this post.", ">Let me guess, it's common in the South.\n\nI've lived in the south all my life, and I've never heard of it.  It sounds awful.", "See comment above, it\u2019s a Northeastern game. But bless your heart for trying", "Southerner here, have seen this game 5 or 6 times.", "I live in the south and we played it at my baby shower, the guests tore off toilet paper at the length they were guessing. I didn't have a problem with it, but as mentioned above every expecting mother should have the right to decide whether or not they're comfortable with the game.", "I\u2019ve lived in the south my whole life and I\u2019ve never heard of this game.", "I'm from Canada, and I have never heard of this game either. It would never fly where I live. Granted where I am, it's significantly more common to have a baby shower after the baby is born than it is before the birth. It's considered bad luck to do it earlier than that. I think that's a local thing though, and not indicative of wider Canadian practices.", "It's a celebration of the growth of the baby and acknowledge the change having a baby is, whats shocking? That there's no wildfires involved like a gender reveal party?", "I'm another vote for never having heard of this as someone from East Coast US.", "I live on the east coast and have probably seen it at almost every shower I have been to", "It\u2019s really not? I think it depends on the mom to be. I loved my bump and never equated it with being fat, so a game like this wouldn\u2019t have bothered me at all.", "Yeah also NE US native checking in and this sounds ghastly. I would never presume someone was okay with it.", "I\u2019ve seen it in the Mid-Atlantic region, also in the south. But I\u2019ve spent most of my life in the Mid-Atlantic so mostly there.", "I live in New England and it has been played at every baby shower I\u2019ve gone to!", "Midwest and its always been a thing at baby showers I've gone to. We even did it in California for my cousins shower out there. The California shower was the only one where they actually used a tape measure though. All the other ones used a piece of string the guest had cut and mom would try them over her belly to see who was closest to guessing the bump size. I like that version better because no one is touching mom or actually using numbers to measure. But I can still see how that might even be triggering to some people.", "Never played it in the South -- at least the parts of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee where I've gone to baby showers!", "I've seen it in the PNW", "I\u2019m from New England, been to many, many baby showers and never seen this. This is wild. I would have been horrified", "most parties i go to don\u2019t have games at all unless the majority of people there are children, that\u2019s just the culture of my family and my region, so \u201clet\u2019s all guess how big someone\u2019s belly is!!\u201d is a bit strange to me haha.", "So strange. I\u2019ve also been mostly mid-Atlantic.", "That\u2019s funny. I\u2019m from Georgia, and it\u2019s been played at every single baby shower I\u2019ve ever been to. Must be really specific", "Same. Most of them haven\u2019t included games like that at all, thankfully.", "Ahh I see, in that case  all I'll suggest is consider trying to be whimsical or playful every now and again, there's no reason playing should just be for children, try a trampoline centre or a theme park,  they are great for letting go of adult problems for a while."]}
