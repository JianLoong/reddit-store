{"id": 33313, "submission_id": "18lo0kj", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter I want to remarry?", "selftext": "My (38M) wife died 2 years ago in a car accident. The grieving process, along with having to take care of my daughter who was 11 at the time, was extremely painful and difficult for me. I was diagnosed with depression and had to take medication. As for my daughter, she didn\u2019t go to school for weeks and even now still is grieving her mother\u2019s death. \n\nDuring dinner, she abruptly asked me if I ever thought of dating again, or remarrying. And while the grief of my wife\u2019s death affects me everyday and I miss her all the time, I do have to move on with my life. There have been times where I have considered asking a woman for her phone number and going on dates. \n\nI told her that yes, that I would like to date again and probably one day remarry. This made her very upset, she began crying and saying I was replacing her mother and that I was horrible person. We fought for a few minutes before she stormed upstairs and locked her door. It\u2019s been a few hours and she hasn\u2019t come out of her room since and has been telling me to fuck off every time I try to talk to her. \n\nWhile I understand that to her perspective, I\u2019m replacing her mother  as she is still grieving her mother\u2019s death and doesn\u2019t want to see someone take her place. At the same time, this is my life and while I would do anything to bring my wife back to me, I do have to move on and my daughter shouldn\u2019t be the decision maker in my love life. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been reading through a lot of the comments and thought I should address somethings in an edit instead of individual comments. Firstly is that my daughter is in therapy and has been in therapy for the past two years. I also am in therapy too. We\u2019ve never have had family therapy because my daughter and I have always had a very close and good relationship. We don\u2019t fight ever. \n\nMy daughter is my first priority, not any hypothetical girlfriend or wife, so I do consider her feelings in this. I do understand that my poor wording is probably what made her so upset. But, in my opinion, if I want to date someone, that IS my choice, not hers. She can\u2019t have dictatorship over my love life. If I were to have a girlfriend, I would take it very slowly, and want my daughter to adjust to this new change in her life. Her happiness is the most important thing in my life. But I think this would also be beneficial for her, to possibly help her move on from the past. \n\nAlso, just for clarification, my daughter isn\u2019t 11, she\u2019s 13. She was 11 when my wife passed away.", "created_utc": 1702944941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lo0kj/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_want_to_remarry/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s a grieving child in the thick of puberty\u2014show me one adolescent who has never once flipped out or overreacted to something while hopped up on hormones and growing up. Now add losing a parent on top of that. Her reactions are probably not going to be super predictable or rational, and that\u2019s something the two of you will have to work through. I can\u2019t call her an asshole for that. \n\nDid you handle this well? No, you didn\u2019t\u2026but show me a parent who has all the answers at all times, then show me a grieving widow/er who knows exactly how to respond their their grieving children at all times. I can\u2019t call you an asshole for that. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t have known she would flip out, just like she couldn\u2019t have known she was asking a question she didn\u2019t really want the answer to. I\u2019m betting, in fact, that she asked in good faith and didnt expect to flip out. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have argued with her, but again: you\u2019re learning lessons as you go. You can\u2019t talk an emotional person, particularly an emotional teenager, out of their reactions. \n\nThe only thing I can really fault you for it is you calling it your life. Until your daughter is an adult it IS both of your lives. You have a right to happiness, but you need to factor her in. That might mean you don\u2019t get serious with anyone until she\u2019s older. To an extent I agree that kids shouldn\u2019t control their parents love lives, but neither should parents pretend new relationships shouldn\u2019t matter to their kids, and that\u2019s a mistake you\u2019re in danger of making. \n\nIf neither of you are in therapy then please seek it now. Both individual and family. This isn\u2019t insurmountable, but professional help is probably best. The only way out is through; no sense in going through it alone.", "Has your daughter had grief counseling? Have you? You all really need it.\n\nShe asked you a fraught question, but you're the adult and you should have been more curious about why she was asking rather than telling her yes. You may feel lonely and ready to date someday but it's a completely different situation for your daughter who can never replace her mother or recreate that type of relationship again. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss but there is a ton of content online, lots of self-help books, therapy, and other resources at your disposal. Please use them to better help your grieving daughter. You are the only parent she has.\n\nI'm voting YTA because you argued with her about this and hurt her further rather than trying to be open to understand her feelings and fears. She's a kid, it's not on her to be the more mature one.\n\nEdit: grammar mishap", "NTA - you deserve to be happy with a new relationship. You aren\u2019t replacing her mother, hopefully she will come to understand this. She sees you as a dad not a man with hopes, desires and someone who wants adult companionship. Talk to the school counselor or a therapist about the best way to move forward.", "NTA. \n\n\u201cDo you want to date and marry again?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe one day\u2026 but not today.\u201d Then focus your all of your energy on your child until she turns eighteen or tells you that you should start dating, whichever comes first.", "YTA no it\u2019s not just your life - it stopped being solely your life when you decided to be a parent. What\u2019s her therapists take on this? You got help for your depression; what\u2019s her help for her grief been like?", "NAH \nI would say ESH but she\u2019s a child.  \nYou need to understand it\u2019s not just your life, it is hers too.  \n\nI suggest you get her into therapy immediately.  Not only individual therapy but therapy with you as well.  There you can broach the topic of your hopes to eventually date and remarry.  I would also get individual therapy so you can learn how to make the transition in an emotionally safe way without further harming her.   You don\u2019t get to just be a single man - you need to be a single man with a child who should always come first.  \n\nI truly hope you don\u2019t become one of those parents that do effectively replace their ex/late spouse with another and then replace your child with a spouses existing children and/or any new children you may have.  Your child needs to be #1 always - no matter if you end up with step kids or not.  You need to use a therapist to help properly blend any potential future partner and step-kids.  You also need to use effective birth control before you just come home and tell your child you\u2019re expecting another child.  Too many parents do that and the existing child (the one who has been through an incredibly traumatic time) literally ends up pushed aside and pushed out.  \nAlso *never* refer to any new wife as her \u201cnew mom.\u201d  Ever. Do not force parental relationship.   If you meet someone you plan on marrying I suggest you take them to therapy with the both of you so your partner understands boundaries and her place in your daughter\u2019s life.  \n\nIf you want to move on *do it right!*\nOne more thing.  If a future partner *ever* tries to exclude your daughter dump her ass immediately.  Immediately.   No \u201clet\u2019s talk about this.\u201d Don\u2019t fall into that trap all because you want to move on and get your willy wet.  Don\u2019t be one of those parents and don\u2019t be one of those fathers.", "NTA. She asked a question and you honestly answered. There is no way you could have known she was going to act that way.", "I think a healthy message for your daughter would be that you could never replace her mom, that if you do date she can decide how much she wants another woman in her life, and most importantly that mom would want you both to find happiness again.", "NTA for wanting to move on but this could be handled better. She\u2019s young and she sees things differently because she misses her mom as much as you do. You said she didn\u2019t go to school for weeks! she\u2019s not as emotionally mature to handle this. Instead of arguing with her, you need to have a series of conversations and understand that she\u2019s a child", "NAH - your daughter's position is not necessarily the rational one, but I don't have it in me to call a 13 year old who is grieving her mother's unexpected death an asshole.", "YTA.\n\nDid you seriously just describe fatherhood as, \"having to take care of my daughter?\"\n\nShe is a CHILD. Give her the love and support she needs, because you are secondary.", "NTA.  Please try to see it from her perspective.  She lost her only mother and at such a young age.  You lost your first wife.  She doesn\u2019t yet understand the difference between her loss and yours.", "NTA (depending on how you phrased things and the great context of how that conversation came to be). She\u2019s 13. It\u2019s a tough age. She\u2019ll understand when she\u2019s older.", "I don't think you're an AH for wanting to remarry one day. \n\n>We fought for a few minutes \n\nThis might make you an AH though. Why were you fighting with your heartbroken child?", "NAH. You're both still grieving. Please get some family counseling. Also determine your boundaries with you daughter about remembering and paying respect to her mom: how many pictures must be kept even if you marry, whether you ever expect her to call another partner \"step-mom\" etc. And whatever boundaries the two of you decide, your future partners have to also honor as well. Soo many stories of widowed parents running rough shod over their kids grief", "> this is my life \n\nNo. At the moment you can say it's \"our life\" because you have a 13yo and any decisions you make about marriage or long terms relationships immediately affects your child's entire world. \n\n> my daughter shouldn\u2019t be the decision maker in my love life.\n\nWhen she is a young teen her wellbeing should absolutely take precedence over your love life. If she can't cope with you introducing a date, then you need to not be dating until you guys have worked something things out in therapy, or she has gotten past this stage.\n\nYTA", "NTA. I strongly recommend family therapy for you together as you try to work through this.", "INFO: Has your daughter been in any kind of therapy? Also, are you sure you want to move on? Have you given thought to why you might be but she isn't?", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s very clear you\u2019re both still grieving and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with the fallout from a seemingly innocent question. You will have to pick your words carefully. It\u2019s going to be tough with an emotionally charged teenager.\n\nShe needs to hear something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cYou lost a mother and that\u2019s put a big hole in your heart and life.\n\nBut I lost someone too. Your mother and I were soulmates and best of friends. I never imagined my life without anyone else, and still wish every day we could have your mother back in our lives. \n\nAnd while I can\u2019t imagine myself married to anyone else right now, I would like to think someday I\u2019ll find someone to love again. But even if I find someone, they will never replace your mother. \n\nI hope you can understand that\u201d\n\nIf she keeps up with this, you may want to consider writing something like this on on a note and slipping it under her door.\n\nI hope you guys patch things up soon. Posts like this are just so heart wrenching.", "NTA for wanting to move on but this is one of those things where you have to explain properly that you're not replacing her mom, you just want to be able to have a partner once you're ready. Please whatever you do, if you start dating someone never try to push them on your daughter as a 2nd mom or whatever, be open with your daughter and be willing to talk and reminice about your late wife do not avoid it like a plague. If you love your daughter you need to still do what's best for her and listening to her and making her feel loved. Please tell me you and your daughter both go to therapy.", "Have you gotten your daughter into grief therapy? There are camps for kids who have lost a parent so they can be around other kids who are grieving as well. There are resources you need to look into to better support your daughter because it is going to be difficult for her when you begin dating again and it would be best for her to have a support network and people to remind her that you are not replacing her mother but you are moving on.\n\nNTA. You need to live your  life. You can not live your life clinging to the past however, you do need to be conscious of your daughter's feelings and get her the BEST support you can. And, whoever you date, take it slow enough so your daughter can adjust and get used to the new woman. No matter what, your daughter needs to be your first priority from here out. Not your girlfriend. Not your wife in the future. Your daughter. So if the woman you are dating is not good to your daughter, that relationship needs to end.", "NAH. She will never get over losing her mom, especially when she wasn\u2019t old when your wife passed. My mother committed a weird sort of suicide at 66 and I\u2019m still not over it or come to terms with it. Because of the circumstances no amount of counseling will help me but it very well could help your daughter. It will help her once you do start dating to understand that you\u2019re not trying to replace her mother, nothing can replace your loved ones, but that you don\u2019t want to live your life alone either. One thing that might help your daughter understand this is if you two sit down and make a collage of all of you. This will be a constant reminder that not only do you love your late wife but that nothing can replace those parts of your life. It won\u2019t be a complete fix but it might help your daughter until you can get her going into counseling.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to move on with your life. She's gonna find that difficult to accept.", "YTA \n\n1. Shes eleven!! Can you not wait a few more years until she is old enough to deal with the complexity of the situation? \n\n2. Two years is a very short mourning period in my opinion. Of course you can  date and remarry one day, but two years is such a short time period. Of course dating someone after two years (or the idea of it) would freak your kid out. \n\nJust to clarify you are not an asshole for wanting to date again. You are an asshole for considering it after only two years and them admitting you are ready to move on to your 11 year old child who is still in mourning. In my opinion, parents should always put the needs and emotional state of their child above their own.\n\nApologize and wait until she is an adult (or at-least a teenager) to start dating again.", "NAH. Not only is she a teenager with teenage emotions & hormones, she\u2019s still very much grieving and maybe not in a very healthy way. You weren\u2019t wrong for being honest with her, but she\u2019s not wrong for feeling the way she does. \n\nI highly recommend grief counseling for the both of you!!", "NTA.  Tell her her mother is irreplaceable, but that she wouldn't want people she loved to go without love for the rest of their lives. That love isn't finite, but the more you love, the more there is to give.\n\nAnd after two years, it might be time for professional help for your daughter.", "NAH. Everything feels monumental at that age, and she is dealing with some pretty big trauma - understandably. Reassure her that there will never be a replacement for her mother, and that she (your daughter) will always come first in your life. She will adjust to the idea eventually, but I would suggest giving her more time before you bring any dates/partners around her.", "NAH(I\u2019m not gonna call a grieving minor an AH) apart from some rather poor phrasing in the final paragraph. While I understand how it may feel for your daughter, you are allowed to one day date and remarry. We don\u2019t all pledge to be single forever when our spouses die. \n\nIt may be a good idea to consider family therapy if you are not already? So that when that day comes your daughter does not completely lose it.", "YTA.  Not for wanting to date some time in the future, but for being a crap parent and handling this terribly.  Go get some counselling and parenting classes.", "Mild YTA. The correct answer at that moment in time would have been \"maybe someday, a long time from now\".  \nShe will be grieving her mother's death for the rest of her life. Until she has her own, your life isn't really your 'own'--every decision has to be based on what is best for the both of you.  \nPlease get into or continue counseling, individually and together.", "NAH - The only thing I'd say is maybe you should have gone with \"I don't know\"", "NTA. If it were during my early teen years, I would be disciplined and punished for using that language on you. I understand she is still grieving. She needs to understand that someday she will move out and move on. You can't be expected to grow old alone. I suggest a frank, yet gentle discussion or several with her. Another woman would not be a replacement. I would suggest not dating seriously with this unresolved.", "NAH, but it\u2019s close to YTA for arguing with her about it. She is 13, lost her mom at 11. Are you both in therapy, both separate and together? It\u2019s naive to think that she\u2019ll be OK with the idea of a new woman in your life. But let\u2019s be clear - your daughter is 13. It\u2019s not just \u201cyour\u201d life. Where your life goes, hers goes too. Whether you like it or not, your life is also her life, and you need to grow up and deal with that.", "This is so well-said, I really hope OP reads this and takes your words and advice to heart.", "lol except that she\u2019s 13. Of course she\u2019s going to act that way. She\u2019s a child. OP should be more sensitive rather than being mad his daughter has feelings about his love life, since that absolutely impacts her.", "I don\u2019t think any sane, empathetic person would!", "I imagine he meant \"while experiencing devastating loss\"", "Your vote means the kid is an AH; was that your intent, or did you mean NAH?", "Summary: child\u2019s emotional and mental wellbeing > love life", "Thank you. I hope that OP is coming here in part because he knows he messed up and is willing to put the work in to be better.", "might I remind you we are on Reddit."]}
