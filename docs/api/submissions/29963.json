It sounds like your mother has some unresolved issues and distrust that she will have to deal with herself. You have a high fever, you take medicine to bring it down.

She's not owed respect if she's going to let her pet issues poison her relationships with everyone.\n\nIf anything being this way with her will be good experience for when you're older and doing actually meaningful things that send her into a tantrum.

As somebody who has been there before, I get it. You're a kid and still learning how to express your emotions. Adults have outbursts like that, too. It's on your mom for yelling at you instead of having a conversation. My mom constantly yelled at my siblings and I when we were kids instead of having a calm conversation.

You're also not the AH for having justified anger for your friend. YTA however for the way you express that to your mother, whom as far as I can tell from your post, hasn't tried to be intentionally malicious towards you in any way, and is just in an unfortunate spot where she is believing a lot of things that aren't true (as you say). Your mom is an AH for generalizing a group of people, but a lot of people believe in a lot of things for a lot of reasons, and as far as I can tell she hasn't been malicious towards you in any way. Try educating her in a respectful manner so you can at least have a good relationship with her, or set some boundaries where you won't be put in situations where you feel you will let your emotions get the better of you. Like you said your dad has full custody so it isn't like she can control you much anyway, why let it get to you so much. You saying what you said doesn't help anything and it doesn't make any points, so why say it.

I'm not OP and know nothing about dengue fever, do the vitamins from these solutions really help??", "She *was* being malicious though... she demanded him stop taking meds just because it was western medication while op was having dengue fever. Besides what's the point in a toxic relationship with a racist? \n\nOp could be the one to educate her but like also he's the child in this situation, he should be having a mother who actually cares for him and doesn't spew hate. Sometimes the best relationship is little to none. I also gotta say op gets a pass this time for being a bit rude since he's young, he was sick and probably also sick of his mom being awful. The rudeness didn't help anything but I can't say it did anything worse either, I doubt she'll change much from this interaction. Although if something this small does change the mom for the worse than that's just even more reason for op to feel better about his dad having full custody. (And maybe dad should use that to keep her away permanently if she gets worse)", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mother displayed pure assholery here. You voiced out your opinion in a normal way, nothing wrong with that. Your mother said racist comments as well beforehand and due to the divorce, indeed, does not have any say to what you consume or don't or who you befriend or not.", "Nta, my daughter is with me 90% of the year, her mother is very narcissistic and my daughter is catching on and not wanting to be around her. It's not your fault in any way, shape or form. Your mom needs to hear the truth, its the only way she \"may\" change. My daughter stood up to her mom and told her she's no longer staying with her in the summer for more than a month, and it helped, a very tiny amount.", "GErman here. NTA. You did right, she pushed and pushed and pushed, time to push back.\n\nI wish you a speedy and healthy recovery.

Why would she want you to suffer with pain and fever instead of taking an over the counter medication that can help?  I know you love your mom, but that doesn\u2019t imply you need to agree with everything she does.  Put the polite border up and try not to get emotionally entangled in disagreements with her.  Good luck.", "I'm impressed you didn't say worse. You are NTA. You may  live her, but she's TA. \n\nI'm not sure about American law but it MAY help to remind her that you are your own person with your own thoughts and feelings and that her attitude impacts on your wellbeing and also remind her that continued behaviour like that WILL determine how much you see her once you age out of the court agreement for her to see you.\n\nIf things get really bad you may have to ask your dad to get a new court order saying you only visit your mother when YOU want to.\n\nI hope (whatever happens) you have a wonderful life and you achieve all of your dreams", "NTA.  I dread what you'd be going through if she were your custodial parent.\n\n\"I'm still your mom. You should show some respect.\"\n\nRespect is earned not given.

What the hell", "NTA, if you want to repair your relationship some, and it shouldn't be on you to do so, you can ask her what she would suggest you do to battle the disease. If it isn't to outrageous you might wanna consider adding that to help you recover. Don't stop taking the Tylenol as needed. Your mom may just have experience using other medical treatments that might be very effective. I hope you recover quickly. I doubt it but I hope your mom learns to communicate instead of just cutting you off with the \"I should be an authority figure in your life so you should listen to me without question because otherwise it's disrespectful\" bs. There are times you need to just listen to authority but outside emergencies and dangerous situations you should be able to discuss why those decisions where made. \n\nFor instance your mom should have respected you enough to make a statement like \"I don't like that you are taking XYZ medication. It would help you a lot more if you did XYZ instead.\" Western medication has its place but it can be overused. Doesn't sound like your case though.", "NTA honey!
