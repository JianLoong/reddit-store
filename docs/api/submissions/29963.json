It sounds like your mother has some unresolved issues and distrust that she will have to deal with herself. You have a high fever, you take medicine to bring it down. Especially with other symptoms involved. \nI admit it may have been a bit harsh but it was building to it. Maybe she will take a hard look now and reevaluate her views. Or if not then you know moving forward where she stands and can have firm boundaries in place", "NTA\n\nDengue Fever is intensely painful and she wants you to go through that with no pain relief?", "NTA\n\nI'm western, so take my judgement with a grain of salt, but if a parent is acting like an absolutely terrible piece of work and has to fall back on, \"I'm your x, so you should show some respect\" as a means to order you about than they've already demonstrated why you don't. She's not owed respect if she's going to let her pet issues poison her relationships with everyone.\n\nIf anything being this way with her will be good experience for when you're older and doing actually meaningful things that send her into a tantrum. Like dating a woman she doesn't approve of, not living close enough to her, etc.", "I don't think any part of this makes you an asshole. It's how you feel. As somebody who has been there before, I get it. You're a kid and still learning how to express your emotions. Adults have outbursts like that, too. It's on your mom for yelling at you instead of having a conversation. My mom constantly yelled at my siblings and I when we were kids instead of having a calm conversation. After a while, you start to yell back in hopes she'll just shut the fuck up. Nobody's perfect, and I wouldn't beat yourself up about this.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "Your mom sounds fun.

You're also not the AH for having justified anger for your friend. YTA however for the way you express that to your mother, whom as far as I can tell from your post, hasn't tried to be intentionally malicious towards you in any way, and is just in an unfortunate spot where she is believing a lot of things that aren't true (as you say). Your mom is an AH for generalizing a group of people, but a lot of people believe in a lot of things for a lot of reasons, and as far as I can tell she hasn't been malicious towards you in any way. Try educating her in a respectful manner so you can at least have a good relationship with her, or set some boundaries where you won't be put in situations where you feel you will let your emotions get the better of you. Like you said your dad has full custody so it isn't like she can control you much anyway, why let it get to you so much. You saying what you said doesn't help anything and it doesn't make any points, so why say it. Coming from someone with a toxic mother myself.", "No. Women can be far more manipulative and psychologically abusive than men, and the world congratulates them.

Besides what's the point in a toxic relationship with a racist? \n\nOp could be the one to educate her but like also he's the child in this situation, he should be having a mother who actually cares for him and doesn't spew hate. Sometimes the best relationship is little to none. I also gotta say op gets a pass this time for being a bit rude since he's young, he was sick and probably also sick of his mom being awful. The rudeness didn't help anything but I can't say it did anything worse either, I doubt she'll change much from this interaction. Although if something this small does change the mom for the worse than that's just even more reason for op to feel better about his dad having full custody. (And maybe dad should use that to keep her away permanently if she gets worse)"]}
