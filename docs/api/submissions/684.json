{"id": 684, "submission_id": "yj7ezs", "title": "AITA if I ask my wife to stop buying \"junk\" good?", "selftext": "Hello! Here is the context:\n\nI grew up in a home where we cooked most of our meals at home and it was uncommon to have \"junk food\" in the house.  When I say junk food, i mean chips, sweets, excess breads, frozen meals, soda, processed snack /pantry foods, etc. We didn't eliminate these foods completely,  they were viewed more as \"treats\" to have on occasion. For example, family get togethers was a time to enjoy whatever foods were there, mcdonalds on the way home from karate class every other week, poptarts every so often were bought as one of my requested treats. Ultimately, our family values in the home were to take care of our body and that included being mindful of what we ate.\n\nSo, I have those values instilled in me and carried them with me through high school, college, post college. My MO was to not bring lower quality foods into my living space and cooking most of my meals. I moved in with my gf (now wife) at 25 (we are both now 30), and some of our differences in values around nutrition started to stand out. She grew up in a home that did not have the same values as mine and in her words, they often ate takeout and ate processed junk food around the clock in the house. Fast forward to now, we  frequent doordash over home cooked meals and have junk food in the house. i have put in effort to change our habits but to put it bluntly, she does not want to eat as healthy as I think we should. Maybe that's not fair to say because she does express with her words she wants to be healthy, but when I try to influence us in that direction, she reacts with tension and anxiety.\n\n I have sort of backed off on that over the years which is a silent compromise I made, which may be part of the problem. I do the cooking in the house and in her words she would only be able to cook Mac n cheese and canned ravioli for herself if I didn't cook (obviously a little hyperbole but its her words). \n\nAnyways, to get to the point, we split grocery duties and she will often have her junk foods / treats in the house. I am starting to eat them because they're there. Historically maybe this wouldn't be a problem but we have kids now and more demanding remote jobs, so stress is higher and therefore I am also stress eating more. If its in the house, I have a hard time not going to eat it. I have put on a few pounds and am getting frustrated with my habits.  So, AITA if I ask my wife to stop bringing excess junk foods into the house?\n\nI do want to say my eating habits and decisions making are solely my responsibility which is why I may be TA. I also understand relationships take communication, support, and sacrifice from one another to work through things like this. \n\nFinally, do I have an unhealthy relationship with food if I can't control my eating?", "created_utc": 1667305692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj7ezs/aita_if_i_ask_my_wife_to_stop_buying_junk_good/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She says she cant cook, well maybe a start would be you two cooking together. It does a lot for your teamwork as parents, and is really good for the children to see and learn from too. It would most likely also be too much to just eliminate junk food completely, but if you guys can get into a rhythm where cooking food yourselves is the norm, that would be amazing. But do communicate about it.", "YTA\n\nYour eating is your issue.  You need to learn self-control.  Your parents' \"no junk food in the house\" rule didn't teach you self-control.  It eliminated the need for self-control regarding junk food, so you never learned to control yourself.\n\nYour wife should not have to go without treats she can eat and enjoy in moderation because you lack self-control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like an opportunity to have a family fun meal prep and one night a week each person cooks for the family from the prepped meals (or some equivalent). If there are junk snacks in the house and you can\u2019t refrain from eating them, I don\u2019t think that makes your wife the bad guy.", "NAH.  If your SO wants to buy and eat junk food, it's on her. I don't blame you for wanting to have healthier habits, but ultimately, you can't control what she eats.", "NAH\n\nGood buying habits drive good eating habits in my experience. If you know you have a hard time holding off, then you should take care to not put yourself in that situation. \n\nI very very much understand it's a lot easier and \"comfortable\" to just eat trash food on demand than having to think about, plan and prepare meals as I very often fall in that trap myself.  So I can't really blame your wife either.\n\nSadly if you're not on the same page there's not a lot to be done about this. Since it's obviously more important to you than her, then perhaps suggest taking care of the vast majority of meals and food in general? This would probably have to include grocery duties if she can't keep herself from buying \"treats\". Ofc she'd have to pick up other chores to compensate imo. \n\nYou should have a good discussion around this.", "Thank you for your thoughts. We used to do Blue Apron alot before kids. I do most of the cooking now and it has gotten overwhelming because she does not always want to eat what I would like to cook so I compromise. Thats fine for the most part, its the snacking that I am having difficulty with.", "Fair enough. This is what my gut was telling me with the self control. I will say her eating junk food is not in moderation, but your point still stands."]}
