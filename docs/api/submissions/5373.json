There was a lot of drama. My son Matthew was born and her crazy family wanted to adopt him but my dad ended up being the one who adopted him.\n\nMy parents (who have been divorced for 20 years) told me that they rather I go back to college and establish myself so I can be the father I needed to be for Matthew. I was still a kid myself. \n\nMaybe I wasn't there every day. Now I'm about to get married and my fianc\u00e9e loves Matthew as much as I do. We both make good money and just bought a house. \n\nOver the years my dad has started to treat me like I'm just Matthew's older brother. He's 7 and I'm actually a responsible adult. Basically I want Matthew to start living with me and I take charge of him. My dad is being an ass now about it even going as far as to tell me that I need permission from HIM to spend time with MY son. He's my son regardless of what paperwork my parents made me sign.\n\nA lot of things bother me about how my dad is taking care of my son and my mom sides with him every time. I would do things very differently. \n\nI reminded that my goal is to take him back, my dad said \"that's not going to happen.\" I reminded him that he is not his dad and never will be. Then I told him him that I don't even agree with how he's running things and I can do better.\n\nEdut: Why should I ask my dad permission to take my kid out with my girlfriend (who is going be his stepmom) but my 19yo brother takes him to the beach without asking? \n\nI also should have a say in things like school and medical stuff. I'm not a teenager anymore.\n\nEdit: My dad is 56. He'll be in his 60s when Matthew is a middle schooler.\n\nEdit: Basically my dad tricked me into signing those papers. He literally stole my kid from me.\nWhat kind of dad does that? He planned it all along.\n\nEdit: I don't agree with how my dad is raising him. My dad treats him like a trophy child and is unreasonably controlling. \n\nI am also mad that the reason why Matthew calls my dad \"daddy\" is because he thinks my dad is literally his dad and he calls me \"Landon\" because I'm his brother. \n\n\nEdit: I don't know if Matthew knows I'm his dad. I don't know what my dad told him.", "created_utc": 1671716620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsmdo4/aita_for_reminding_my_dad_hes_not_my_sons_parent/", "score": 2282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry because I do think that\u2019s incredibly hard and I even think everyone made the choices they made with the best of intentions for this child, but, this is the result of getting to go to college and still do normal 18-20something-year-old things instead of be a parent- now, you\u2019re not a parent. Kids aren\u2019t dogs and can\u2019t easily just switch families after a short adjustment period. I think it would be beneficial for the kid to know the situation (at an age appropriate level\nand with input from a counselor maybe?), especially how much you love him, and maybe as he\u2019s older (think, 14+?!) and able to give more input, it can move to a joint custody like situation?! So he knows he\u2019s wanted and loved by all? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s clearly going to be very complicated, and any solutions like that should be generated with the kid\u2019s best interest and the positive support of all parties. \nBut you can\u2019t seriously expect your dad to just give up the child he\u2019s spent seven years raising. \nAnd yes, since there\u2019s a bit of contention over custody, your dad is naturally going to be a bit more deliberate/ thoughtful about when you can take him out for a fun day trip or whatever, compared to your brother who has no motivation to fail to bring the child home. And trust me, that won\u2019t get any better if you act more belligerent about it. \nHonestly I suspect this whole thing is just way too complicated for reddit so it\u2019s hard to judge.

Instead, he allowed his parents to convince him to do what a proper father would have done, which is do what was best for his child. He knew he could not take care of this child in the manner that the child deserved to be raised at that point in his life, and so he decided to agree to his parent's suggestion.\r  \n\r  \nMind you, he did so because he trusted the man and woman who raised and nurtured him, and who anyone with at least a decent relationship with their parents are taught always have your back. If they changed their mind, then that's on them and not on him.

His dad is saying no because the Dad is the Dad to the 7 year old, you don't destabilize a child's life suddenly. Op hasn't said why they are ready to parent or why it is best for the child, only his wants and needs and about his new mom for the kid. The Dad made an offer and now op has remorse.", "I use grandpa as I didn\u2019t want everyone to get confused as to which \u201cdad\u201d I was referring to.\n\nI would agree with everything you\u2019re saying except for the fact that OP\u2019s dad sounds like he encouraged him to go back to school and get established to \u201cbe the dad that Matthew needed\u201d which to me does imply that the intent was for Matthew to return back to OP at some point", "I understand that\u2019s what happened. If I were the grandpa, I just would\u2019ve pushed for guardianship, instead of formalized adoption, with the goal of reunification. Especially since it sounds like OP\u2019s dad encouraged him to go back to school and get established \u201cto be the dad that Matthew needed\u201d.\n\nThat said, I do have many other questions for OP like why did he wait until 3 years after graduation", "It literally just says his dad ended up adopting him. It also says his parents pushed him to go to school so he could be a better father later. You can assume those things if you want to but please remember they're assumptions.", "That may have been the intent, but most people also have the intent to finish college in the 2-3 years it takes depending on the program, not 7.", "You are making assumptions that op is ready to be a father and upend a child life.", "And one day he will be a better father to his children, but the bio kid isn't his child, he's his dads who adopted him. OP and his gf can have a child of their own if they want one.", "We have no idea what relationship he has with his son. Presumably if the son is in his parents house he would reasonably have a relationship with him.", "I'm not assuming OP is ready to be a dad, I'm just pointing out that he didn't up and abandon the kid. It doesn't say how or why dad ended up with custody. It just says he did. It doesn't say OP fucked off and abandoned him. It says his parents wanted him to go to school so he he could be a better father to his son, and that he might not have been there everyday so he was there for some days, and we don't know anything more about that. \n\nThat very much means to me, they led OP to believe he would be raising his son, in the future, and that they were helping in the interim.", ">My parents (who have been divorced for 20 years) told me that they rather I go back to college and establish myself so I can be the father I needed to be for Matthew. I was still a kid myself.\n\nThis, to me, means dad told him he's be getting custody of some sort, and that this was temporary. He didn't abandon this kid, he never wanted to not raise him. His parents made these decisions for him."]}
