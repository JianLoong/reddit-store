I was still a kid myself. \n\nMaybe I wasn't there every day. Now I'm about to get married and my fianc\u00e9e loves Matthew as much as I do. We both make good money and just bought a house. \n\nOver the years my dad has started to treat me like I'm just Matthew's older brother. He's 7 and I'm actually a responsible adult. Basically I want Matthew to start living with me and I take charge of him. My dad is being an ass now about it even going as far as to tell me that I need permission from HIM to spend time with MY son. He's my son regardless of what paperwork my parents made me sign.\n\nA lot of things bother me about how my dad is taking care of my son and my mom sides with him every time. I would do things very differently. \n\nI reminded that my goal is to take him back, my dad said \"that's not going to happen.\" I reminded him that he is not his dad and never will be. Then I told him him that I don't even agree with how he's running things and I can do better.\n\nEdut: Why should I ask my dad permission to take my kid out with my girlfriend (who is going be his stepmom) but my 19yo brother takes him to the beach without asking? \n\nI also should have a say in things like school and medical stuff. I'm not a teenager anymore.\n\nEdit: My dad is 56.

No matter who looks after your child for even several years, the kid, in his mind, will always be his child and no amount of other children will take that away.\n\nI do agree that there's not much sympathy here and I'm not going to be dishing any out. But if he's willing to fight for his child (in a responsible way) and will truly take the needs of his child into consideration, then I respect that.\n\nIt's not like he was totally absent from his child's life and it's hard to tell, but I figure that the kid knows that OP is his dad, even if they do have a more sibling-like relationship, so if it's done in a sensitively and planned way, that is in the best interests of the child, then why wouldn't it work out?", "Until a fiancee saw his brother and said \"i want that\".", "I'm sure his parents  didn't bring home the papers and say \"sign  here\"", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP believes that the deal was that he'd go to college, get a good job, and get his son back. His parents seemingly feel like Matthew's life is established, and its in his best interest not to change it. I understand what OP would feel wronged here but I also think its in best interest of the kid to keep things as they are.", "Why would I question my dad?", "Potentially, because of his stage in life and immaturity, he wouldn't have gotten custody over his child, it would have went in favour of his maternal family.\nGrandad stepped in and said he'd care for the child, which at the time was the best option of the 3.\nSounds like OP was told that Grandparents would care for the child while he was at college and then once he'd established himself, that he could move in with OP.", "[removed]", "That his son would be allowed back in his care if he went to college and established himself.", "OP\u2019s wording is concerning though. He says his father convinced him to go back to school to be the father his son needed him to be.

I don\u2019t necessarily agree that the ends justify the means, here.", "Yes the agreement was they'd adopt their grandson because the parents couldn't/wouldn't provide for them. If there isn't something in the agreement that they'd give up custody after a certain point then it doesn't matter what OP says. Maybe it's all in OPs head? Maybe he assumed whenever he decided he wanted to be a parent he'd get the child back. Not how life works.  Sounds like he just wants to play house now that his GF likes his kid. Why wasn't the kid good enough before that? He walked parents stayed he lost his rights.", "I'm pretty sure lawyers were involved.

You did not fight for custody of your child.  The grandparents fought for custody.  My sister had a baby at 18.  She didn\u2019t leave her child with anyone.  She didn\u2019t go to college.  She worked and raised her kid.  You chose your life over your son.  It\u2019s terribly selfish now to try and take your son from the only home he has always known.  You have no legal rights to him.  Saying nasty things to your father does not prove you are a responsible person ready to raise a child.  It shows you to be a very entitled young  man throwing a fit when he doesn\u2019t get his way.", "You don\u2019t sound ready, but this wasn\u2019t misleading on your parents\u2019 part.

That really sucks for you, but college takes four years and it has been seven now. If this was the most important thing for you, why didn't you make it happen sooner?\n\nOkay, I am sorry. That was judgemental.\n\nEither way. Your dad is his legally his father, and you probably don't have a leg to stand on in court, and doing something like that would sour the whole situation beyond repair. So that is out of the question.\n\nYou need to have some heart to hearts with your dad about how both of you feel. You need to figure out why he is going back on his promise, and you need to explain to him why you've dragged your feet on getting back your son.\n\nWhat would be best for the boy has to be the most important thing, and this kid will not suffer from having two loving parents more in his life.

Why would I feel bad for him LMAO.", "And? You're old enough to care for it then too. I have 2 good friends who had kids at 13 and one at 14. All raised their kids and are all doing great. I know people who waited til their late 20s and couldn't hack it. Age is a number. It is your responsibility to take care of your actions.

The girlfriend would be the SIL in this scenario, assuming they get married.", "If we're going by my logic, the time that he was ready to reclaim his child may have been dictated by the grandparents, rather than OP.

It is never mentioned that parents agreed with it or that OP even said that when he was younger.", "No, it's not. OP said that his parents coaxed him into going back to college so he can be better dad.
