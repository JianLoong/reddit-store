I was still a kid myself. \n\nMaybe I wasn't there every day. Now I'm about to get married and my fianc\u00e9e loves Matthew as much as I do. We both make good money and just bought a house. \n\nOver the years my dad has started to treat me like I'm just Matthew's older brother. He's 7 and I'm actually a responsible adult. Basically I want Matthew to start living with me and I take charge of him. My dad is being an ass now about it even going as far as to tell me that I need permission from HIM to spend time with MY son. He's my son regardless of what paperwork my parents made me sign.\n\nA lot of things bother me about how my dad is taking care of my son and my mom sides with him every time. I would do things very differently. \n\nI reminded that my goal is to take him back, my dad said \"that's not going to happen.\" I reminded him that he is not his dad and never will be. Then I told him him that I don't even agree with how he's running things and I can do better.\n\nEdut: Why should I ask my dad permission to take my kid out with my girlfriend (who is going be his stepmom) but my 19yo brother takes him to the beach without asking? \n\nI also should have a say in things like school and medical stuff. I'm not a teenager anymore.\n\nEdit: My dad is 56.

The idea you think you can is worrying in itself, trust me (I gunned in). You do not take breaks from this, and do not turn your son's allies and support into enemies to start off. You need them and a community. In case nobody took the time to break it down - I truly hope this helps.

Spin it however you want about age, you being a kid or whatever, but you abandoned your son and your dad stepped in to adopt him.

If you weren't ready/able to raise a child, then you did the best thing by giving the kid up so to someone who could (and has).  But the important part to remember is that letting someone adopt your child is, quite literally, giving them up.  You aren't renting out your kid, you are relinquishing custody of them.  You are a biological father--sperm donor--but your dad is the kid's parent.  He's the one who has been raising him and providing him with a stable, loving home.  Yes, you are entitled to love the kid, but you should also count yourself lucky that he was adopted by someone who is willing to let you have ANY relationship with him.  If he had ended up with his biological mom's family, or strangers, you might not have any opportunity to get to know the child.\n\nAlso, with your edit about your other brother taking the kid to the beach without asking, but there being limits to your interactions, the rest of your post makes it obvious.  You are wanting to usurp and undermine the way your father is raising his kid (yes, to reiterate, the child in question became your dad's when he adopted him), so it is natural that you would not have unfettered access to him.  Honestly, if I were your dad, I'd be concerned you'd try to take him and run, because you don't seem to fully grasp what adoption truly means, and that makes you somewhat dangerous (not necessarily in a \"I'm going to physically harm the kid\" way, but you could scar him for life and throw a well-adjusted, loving life into chaos).", "If your dad formally adopted your son, he indeed is the parent.

I am guessing reading wasn't required for you in college. YTA. Have you contributed any material support, mentally or financially in the past seven years?", "That doesn't change the fact that legally your dad IS his dad.  And aside from legal things, your dad has raised him, making him the *actual* parent in every other way that matters.\n\nYou are a birth father.  And that's not a bad thing to be.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that matters is what is best for this child.  Your wants do not matter at all.  Your father's wants do not matter at all.  Ripping a child from his father (that would not be you, since that's not what you are right now) is a very traumatic thing.  There are ways to transition slowly and kindly, if, and only if, it is the best thing for the child.  We don't know you or your dad or your child, so we can't say what would be the better home for him to live in.  But the way you come across makes it seem like you're doing this for you, and that's the absolute worst thing you can do.

Whatever you want, or wanted, it's now about what your son HAS. And if that's a secure attachment with your parents, and a stable home life, attempting to upset that could negatively impact the rest of his life.\n\nIf you want to be more involved, please consult a child psychologist about the least disruptive way to do this. And try to work WITH your parents, not against them.\n\nEdit: I'm not going to downvote you, because it's a shitty situation, and I get why you want to rush in now that you've got your life together. I just hope that you can slow down a bit, and listen to what some here are saying.", "What didn\u2019t you understand?

Combined with the fact that he\u2019s only trying to get custody 7 years later when he\u2019s got a fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s interested, I fully believe OP was quite fine with his father taking over all child rearing until it was perfectly convenient for OP to step in.

Also, he was in a very stressful, complicated, scary situation and it was his *parents* helping him, not some random stranger or lawyer. Most 18yos who have good relationships with their parents would trust them to be looking after their best interests in a situation like this  \n\nShould he be able to have his son back now? Has he been involved enough to deserve the title of \u201cparent\u201d with this kid? Was dad being sketchy? What\u2019s the better situation for Matthew? I have no idea. It\u2019s too complicated and important of an issue to be decided here.

Taking him away from the home he has always known at 7 is not in the child\u2019s best interest. Easing him into a transition is possible with increased shared custody.", "He is the father, he didn't abandon the kid. His dad adopted him to keep him from the exes family, and then his parents insisted he go to school *so he could be a better father*.

This line also stood out to me: \"A lot of things bother me about how my dad is taking care of my son and my mom sides with him every time. I would do things very differently.\"\n\nMaybe OP expands on that in the comments somewhere that I've missed, but based on that line alone, I feel like it has a lot of potential to change how the whole situation is viewed. I mean, maybe he just means minor parenting differences where there's no \"right\" answer -- should the kid be allowed X amount of screen time a week, or more/less? Do we let him eat at fast food restaurants sometimes or never? Etc. etc. Or maybe he means he thinks dad's punishments are borderline abusive. Or maybe it's a cultural difference -- one raising them hardcore conservative Christian, the other would go for lefty liberal inclusiveness.  That could be a whole bunch of things, and it could play into OP's calculation about what is best for the kid.", "I wholeheartedly agree. This comment section is disgusting, honestly. The hypocrisy of AITA doesn\u2019t cease to amaze me. How an 18 year old doesn\u2019t have a fully developed brain and can\u2019t be fully held liable for his actions and yet\u2026 we have an 18 year old new father who was clearly coerced and manipulated into signing away his child and he was supposed to know better? Foh with that logic.", "If that\u2019s the case, then the best thing happened for the child? If he can\u2019t even read legal documents how was he gonna raise a child. At the very basis of it he should\u2019ve known what legal guardianship and adoption was. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get his hopes up for a lawyer. If this is the US, very very few states even have a provision for reversal period even if there was coercion. It\u2019s a HIGH bar for courts to even consider taking that type of case. Esp since the kid has a stable life rn\n\nAlso lying is not the same thing as coercion", "His \"Maybe I wasn't around everyday\" comment sounds very much like a deadbeat parent on the defensive - someone who had little to no interest in this child's life until now he's getting married and his new wife likes the idea of having a 7yr old kid.", "I mean it sounds like OP did what his parents requested of him - he went back to school and got his shit together and he was under the impression that they would relinquish custody to him. The problem though is they lied about what the papers he was signing actually were. I\u2019m hoping OP answers my question below to expand on how present he was in his son\u2019s life.", "People are skipping this so much. It seems like they played it out that OP would later get son fully but their parents wanted them to focus on school to get a better start for themselves AND Matthew. Because that\u2019s how it was worded. \u201cTo be the father I needed to be for Matthew\u201d literally. Yet now that OP seems like he\u2019s on his feet and wants to follow through they are back peddling. Parents were divorced but decided to raise a child together? OP\u2019s mistake was signing over any rights to begin with but I truly don\u2019t think they fully understood what was happening. It seemed like this was OP\u2019s easiest way out bc I\u2019m the post it also said that the moms family of Matthew tried to adopt. Why do I feel like they told OP that would go away if they just signed over to them? OP parents just as much could have taken care of Matthew for them just the same without adopting ,but would they only do it if they agreed to signing over rights?", "Think what\u2019s best for your kid.

It is about this little boy and what is best for him.", ">because of his stage in life and immaturity, he wouldn't have gotten custody over his child, \n\nI mean, no. He would have likely gotten it if he wanted it, he was a legal adult, he's able to have a child, by law.", "He admits, somewhat sneakily, that he doesn't see the kid too often. At least that's how it reads. So why should he get to take him back? What relationship do they even have?\n\nThis isn't about OP at all. It's about the kid, who is innocent in all of this and the only home he knows is with his grandfather.", "Unfortunately, you don\u2019t always get the luxury of establishing yourself before you have a kid. Especially if you have a child at 18. If he was 22 and just finished college and expecting to get his child back, I think I might feel differently, but it seems like he\u2019s had 3 years to fight for his kid, and he only decided to do it now that he has a fianc\u00e9 who is interested in having the child with them.", "And it doesn't sound like OP is interested in a slow and cautious transition. It sounds like he wants to take the kid right now, and just hopes he adjusts.\n\nIt also sounds like the kid DOES know OP, and knows he's his biodad. What does the kid want?", "Show me where in the post he actually acts like a parent and thinks of the child's needs first? His dad legally adopted the child, op wasn't held at gunpoint. If he was old enough to knock up a person he is old enough to read a contract. He can be involved, but he isn't the parent.", "That's exactly what I was thinking. Now he can be a proud daddy and still not put any work in.\n\nThe way he phrased the \"I can do better\" bit is such a tell as well. He wants to show up his dad. This has so little to do with bettering his son's life and so much to do w/ OP's pride and sense of entitlement.", "As a 20-year-old, I wouldn\u2019t give op that. I struggle to understand, what exactly is so complicated about the paper? Tbh, if he wasn\u2019t mature enough to even understand what adoption means, the decision made by his parents was clearly right, and OP shouldn\u2019t argue with that. The question of age is irrelevant here because the comment itself seems like nothing but a reach to make OP look like the victim. This kind of statement can work when someone has been coerced into signing something that harms them in any way. In this case, nothing about the decision is about OP. It was about the best interests of the kid. I wouldn\u2019t \u201cgive OP\u201d anything because it doesn\u2019t look like this is even about maturity, it\u2019s about complete selfishness.

This means you could have....you know....read the paperwork. Oh and speaking as a lawyer, I hate to tell you this, but your dad is actually your son's dad from a legal perspective. Sure, you might have some principled objection to the idea of this, but trust me, if you overstep that boundary, you will learn very very quickly that the Court has infinitely more power than your feelings.

But expect hard questions about why it took you so long. Until then YTA for claiming your father isn't also the kid's father.

You were in college, why did it take you so long to come back for him?? Also, just saw your edit. Your dad and Matthew have the same age difference as me and my dad.

A 3yr old child isn\u2019t really going to be affected by a house move and living with someone they saw everyday as a parental figure, but it\u2019s been now 7yrs and that child has grown up without you as their parent, now it\u2019s not just a matter of packing up and moving.", "Did you have eyes and were you able to read when you signed this contract?", "INFO:  How does this kid refer to you?\n\nDoes he call you Dad, Papa, or any variation there of?

Mom and dad did the work up till now and now that he's engaged he thinks his fianc\u00e9 can do all the actual parenting and he can have his little accessory.

No one forced him to have a baby with an older woman. His own lust and lack of self control did.", "well he\u2019s old enough to understand the documents he\u2019s signed. it does just seem that his father lied about his intentions", "where was that?", "Agreed. I think that\u2019s going to be an important issue. If OP made real efforts to be part of the child\u2019s life throughout, forged a good relationship with the child, and gave up parental rights based on the promise that they would eventually regain the child, OP may have a case.\n\nIf OP barely made an effort, let his parents do everything, didn\u2019t form a strong bond with the child, and suddenly wants to swoop in 7 years later to remove the child from the only parents they know, OP has much less of a case.", "Absolutely - Katie is right. After seven years, OP hasn\u2019t got one IOTA of a position.", "Did he say that in comments? it doesnt say anything about him thinking it was temporary and that his rights would automatically come back 7 years later after he has a fiance and a house. Seems fishy to me", "But again according to his wording, he said that the kid options were be adopted by either set of grandparents.. \nIt was never op taking care of \"his\" kid \n\nwhat if the kid had been adopted by the mother's family?

I'm sorry but I'm not buying OP's side that the plan was to get the kid back when he was ready. There would have been no need for a legal adoption otherwise. He would have given his parents guardianship otherwise.

That seems a little too suspicious to ignore.", "If I was the parents I would assume telling my kid  to get themselves ready to be the father they needed to be would still mean establishing themselves as a parental figure for their child and being there for them just not financially. Plus university is 4yrs and maybe they thought a 4yr old could manage a change of households, but after OP just continued to not act as a parent and not take their child - they just assumed he wasn\u2019t going to.

They weren\u2019t ready to be an adult so their dad convinced them to let him adopt the child. Saying they \u201cwanted it both ways\u201d is mischaracterizing the story", "Also, I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt but usually, in addition to signing paperwork, a social worker, judge, or attorney is also there to spell out that terminating parental rights is legally binding and irrevocable.", "Yep, totally agree with this. And realistically he would definitely be AH if it wasn't his child's wishes to return to his care.", "Exactly. Sounds like we agree!!\n\nThe OP wants the child to live with him and truly part of his family.

If OP's father and OP's son have developed a father-son relationship, it's entirely on OP not considering his son a priority.

Sort of how an 18 year old would act.  \n\n\nHe also could've told his parents \"no\", and taken care of the kid himself, despite the sacrifices and hardships that would entail. He chose not to.", "Yes! Sorry, I thought I responded to the comment above yours \ud83d\ude48", "I think there's more to it. at 18 okay... but now 7 years later he's questioning? People have kids young all the time and don't just abandon them. Was he actively in the child's life? Was he there for all his sporting events, hard times, colds, illnesses, etc? Did he buy him back to school clothes, or make late night diaper runs? Or was he sorta in and out maybe seeing his son two or three times a month when it was convenient?   \nIt seems to me that now that he has a house and a finance that he is ready to play family. Especially that mom is also taking dad's side.   \nHas OP been fighting for 7 years for custody of his bio son?   \nToo many questions for me to think he was truly coerced and had no clue. Maybe he has remorse now for giving up his child, but he needs to consult a lawyer. He seemed to have been able to get a nice job and a house and a fiance, so maybe some of that effort should have been put into advocating to get his son back.", "tYPiNg iN aLl cApS-\n\nNo shit, I type in call caps to EMPHASIZE THE POINT. Since y\u2019all miss it so frequently \ud83d\ude12\n\nHe agreed to the adoption because he thought he could get him back once he is settled. It took 7 years but he managed to get thing together to have him back and guess what? HE WANTS HIM BACK. \n\nIf there is anything y\u2019all can take from me it\u2019s this. If someone offer you something like this, don\u2019t go with adoption. ASK FOR CUSTODY AGREEMENT. It a lot easier to challenge and you have legal binding words. \n\nThis man parents changed their minds and can just up leave with his child and he wouldn\u2019t be able to do a DAMN thing about it. \n\nThey told him that they wanted him to get himself together with the expectation that he could be a better father to Matthew. Now that he has filled in his half of the bargain, they don\u2019t want to give him back his son.\n\nI bet if OP knew this is what was going to happen, then he probably wouldn\u2019t agreed to the adoption.", "I wonder if OP is misquoting/misrepresenting what was actually stated. I have a family member that gave up a child due to crappy life choices. Her mother told her to make something of herself to \u201cshow\u201d the child she gave up that she wanted to be a better person (even though she would never be able to get her kid back or even see him ever again.) OP\u2019s dad may not have actually stated \u201cgo to college and the kid is yours\u201d, it might have been more along the lines of \u201cmake better choices and you can be in the kid\u2019s life\u201d.", "Yeah, in isolation it doesn't explain anything but pair it with the other comment in his OP,  it certainly indicates that this is something which he's thought for a while and discussed with his parents.", "I literally don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t get that the agreement was that he goes to college so he can be a better dad for his kid, that was the promise. It\u2019s right there in the freaking post. We don\u2019t know what other agreement they had, but if they told him \u201cso you can be a better dad for kid\u201d, it\u2019s implied they intended for him to play a parental role and now he\u2019s being told that\u2019s not the case.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s not good for the kid to go through these big changes in his life and OP is going all wrong about it.", "Oh, that makes more sense.", "He definitely wasn\u2019t made fully aware of what he was actually signing. Your questions are valid though and I hope OP sheds light on how involved he was. I\u2019m also not going to fault him too harshly for questioning it 7 years later - he graduated college and just bought a house. Getting your shit together takes time. Especially if he was told at the time that his father would relinquish custody once he was established.", "That's what I am telling. Because OP never clearly said that his parents have promised to give Mathew to him and OP's parents are behaving like they promised him that.\n\nI believe it is misrepresentation.", "I am more sure of my understanding of situation after reading his replies in comments...", "I don't think we are reading it in the same light. From what I see OP's parents just told him to go to college so he can be better occupied with life a kid wants and OP is now pointing it out as a reason because he wants Mathew.\n\nI would prefer if OP said himself that that was the thing he was promised.", "I admire that. If he was taking on an active role up to this point, I can understand. If he was MIA other than when it was convenient and now wants to play house, I don't think it matters what he thought he was signing. He doesn't deserve to just jump in without some sort of legal fight and proving himself. I hope he does so and ends up being a great father to his bio son! Until then though, it's just chatter to me.", "I've not seen many but will have a look.\n\nEdit: when it comes to these types of things, its always more complex than can be put in a Reddit post."]}
