She has a son, Mark. He was 4 when I started dating Maya. Mark's father, Maya's husband, unfortunately passed away when he was still a baby so he has no memory of him.\n\nMe and Maya got along quite well and our relationship proceeded steadily and without too many problems. In time, I built a good relationship with Mark too and by the time he was 7, we were a good trio. Unfortunately my relationship with Maya ended 2 years ago. It was nobody's fault. There was no cheating or abuse involved. We simply had some problems and we came to the conclusion it was better to break up.\n\nLast week I got a call in the middle of the night: it was Mark calling. When I was still dating Maya, I had given him my phone number and told him to call if he was ever in trouble and needed help. He had never called since me and Maya broke up but that night he was panicking; he called and he told me that he and Maya had a car accident. He was ok but Maya was injured and they had been taken to the hospital. I pondered on what to do but decided to go to the hospital. Maya has no living relatives and Mark told me he was alone so I went there mostly to take care of Mark.\n\nWhen I arrived, Maya was still unconscious so I stayed with Mark for several hours, until she regained consciousness. When she saw me, she asked why I was there and I told her about Mark calling me.\n\nShe said I should not have come and forced me to leave. At the time, I apologized and left because I thought I had overstepped her boundaries but now, thinking back, I don't think I did anything wrong. Mark was panicking and he called the person he wanted by his side in that moment. Was it wrong for me to come?

Mark must have felt overwhelmed and alone,  I\u2019m sure you helped his state of mind by just being there.  You left when you were no longer needed.", "NTA. He looked up to you as a father figure and thought of you. Okay, Mom is upset, but he wanted you there.", "NTA. Mark is what, 11 or 12? He needs someone to look after him. You would have been a bit of an asshole if you HADN'T gone.", "NTA. You were doing a good deed looking out for her kid.", "I think what you did was really sweet.", "NTA I think in time she may evaluate it differently.....you're a good person...who would leave a child alone in that situation? Try not to dwell on it.", "NTA. Here's the thing.. what if she *hadn't* woken up relatively quickly?   \nThe hospital would have had a social worker put him in an emergency foster situation, so he would have been (relatively) safe, but he likely would also have been unable to visit his mother or attend his regular school.  \nYes, his mom was upset, and maybe reasonably so considering her situation and the confusion. But somebody needs to let that kid know he didn't do anything wrong. God forbid something should happen in the future and he has no one he can call.", "NAH, you're her ex so understandable she didn't really want you there. You also weren't in a position to get more information on what you should do until she woke up. This is just all around a rough one", "NTA  \nwhat you did was amazing, i hope it helped Mark!  \nI understand Maya as well, she was,hurt, vulnerable you do not want an ex there.", "NAH - A young boy is afraid for his mother and all alone while she is injured.  This wasn\u2019t an attempt to revisit a relationship, it\u2019s about taking care of a kid who is scared when their primary adult is in an emergency situation.  It might have been a knee-jerk reaction at being surprised by your presence, but she might realize after some thought that it was right for you to show up when Mark called you in a panic.  How cold would it have been to say No anyway?", "NTA\n\nYou did good..  and she'll realise this soon enough...", "No. You were very kind to do so. He won\u2019t forget it.", "How terrifying for mark. You showed him you\u2019ll be there for him. He was probably scared he could end up completely and utterly alone. What you did was a very good thing.", "Nah - you're not wrong for going but I don't think it's fair to judge her reaction in the moment", "NAH. If I was in a car accident that left me u conscious for hours I probably wouldn\u2019t want to wake up to see my ex. However you weren\u2019t wrong to go to the hospital when Mark called. \n\nApologizing and leaving was the right move. Don\u2019t get hung up on the idea that you were in the right\u2014so was she.", "NTA. You were helping a kid who needed help and looked to you. \n\nHopefully she realizes with some time that you meant no harm. Until then, she\u2019s the AH.", "Nah as it stands. You were right to go, and she just woke up after a serious car accident and, I assume, drugs. In a completely non-put-down way, her brain was not working super well right then. She might even have thought you were saying mark called you to come and see her, rather than to come be with him. \n\nQuick story as example: when I was in labour, my parents arrived at the hospital to come support. I invited them, I knew they were coming, and when the nurse told me they were there, I said don\u2019t let them in\u2026because my brain\u2019s panic response was \u2018I can\u2019t make small talk right now!\u2019 No one was expecting polite chitchat, and yet.", "Nta. It was a very kind thing you did. A young boy was troubled and you stepped in to help. Her reaction gives me thought that the relationship  did not end as amicably  as you think, at least from her side.", "NTA. You sound too good for her.", "NTA and I\u2019m pretty sure once she has had some time to think about things she will realize you did the right thing.", "NTA", "no, you didn't do anything wrong. Maybe later Maya will realize that, but what you did for Mark was priceless. Sometimes doing the right thing makes other people upset. Oh well, I'm sure you can live with that better than the thought of that poor kid going through that alone", "Oh. No, you are very definitely not TA. It was lovely of you to go when he needed you.", "NTA. You did a very kind thing.  Not sure why she got so upset, especially when your breakup was mutual.", "Nta I get it she woke up and it was shocking but she really needs to think.", "NTA. He was scared, and he called you. He knows he can reach out and that's important.", "NTA. You did the right thing for the young man. There are a number of reasons she might not have wanted you to see her in that setting. Give it some time and then check in to ensure they both have recovered. You may not have a romantic relationship anymore, but that doesn't preclude you from being a good friend.", "NTA - Mark called you, you showed up, and you respected Maya\u2019s boundaries by apologizing and leaving when she told you to.  I\u2019m sure Mark appreciated you being there with him and I\u2019m sorry to hear that he may not have a very big support system.  :/", "You were damned either way. \n\nBut Id rather my ex showed than not.", "You did not do anything wrong.\n\nMark called you. He was scared and needed someone he trusted. That was you. You stepped up and went there for him. NTA", "NTA. You did what any decent person would do in the situation.", "NTA - I think it was so kind of you to go and comfort Mark.\nI hope when she is thinking clearly she apologizes and thanks you", "NTA. But she wasn't expecting to see you and you should have left without being forced.I dont think it was that you were there supporting her son it was that you were there in her room while she was unconscious. Hopefully once/if she gets over you being there while she was vulnerable without her knowledge she will thank you for being there for her son. .", "NTA.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Mark needed your support while his mother was unconscious and you were there for him.  He'll remember that.", "A 11 year old youve raised for half his life calls you crying and asks you to come see him because his only parent is hospitalised, you\u2019d have to be completely apathetic to say no to him. \n\nDo remember that you went there for him and not for your ex, that can really shift the perspective for you", "You're very much NTA.  Mark was obviously frightened and upset.  You, being a decent human being, were there to support him emotionally. But heaven forbid he developed a delayed medical issue as a result of the accident, at least you were there and could have gotten the attention of medical personnel to help him.  \n\nI'm honestly hoping that Maya's not really an AH either.  It was probably disconcerting for her to wake up in the hospital injured and seeing her ex.  You respected her wishes and left when she asked you to.  Hopefully she'll realize you were being a good guy to Mark when he really needed someone, and thank you for being there for him (and hopefully apologize too).", "NTA\n\nYou did a good and kind thing for Mark.\n\nMaya will realise this once she's on the road to recovery.  She's still traumatised. \n\nWho will look after him if she has to stay overnight in hospital?", "Definitely NTA", "NTA SO MUCH NTA. You were there for a child when he needed you.", "You were being a good human - I hope she becomes well enough to see that and simply thank you", "I wonder what is going on behind the scenes with her to lash out on you.\n\nFirst, you claim the break up was amicable. Which would suggest she doesn't hate you or amything like that. Mark at least doesn't hate you. In fact, he loves you. Why else would you be in his thoughts during such a bad situation?\n\nI guess you are single, as you would have included a partner in this, and we can only assume your ex is single, or mark may have phoned them? Or perhaps he doesn't have her currect boyfriend's contact details so you were second choice? That is my thoughts. Perhaps she didn't want you there in case her current boyfriend shows up and sees you there as well.\n\nEither way, NTA. And if she was just angry you were there in case her boyfriend shows up, that is understandable. If not, I have no reason other than shock and perhaps drugs in her system (morphine, etc) why she'd act like that.", "NTA, while Maya might not have wanted to see you, Mark *needed* you. Maya was unconscious and didn't really want any comfort, but Mark was conscious, scared, and needed someone he trusted. \n\nAlso, OP, Mayas feelings about the whole thing might be partly affected by trauma of a crash, as well as the shock of seeing you there and then also leftover feelings of the breakup.", "NTA. You supported a child when you were asked to. She was traumatized and I wouldn't take it too personally. Thank you for being a good human.", "NTA. You were there for a child.  Good on you.", "You did absolutely nothing wrong. You 100% did the right thing. A child called you for help and you answered that call.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. She owes you a serious apology. He needed you and you were there. She should be grateful.", "NTA hopefully when things get back to normal she will realize Mike needed someone there for him to lean on.", "You did a very kind thing for a frightened young man. Good on you. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.   \nMark called the person who he trusted to help him in that moment.   \nSend Mark a text saying something like \u201cI am ok with your calling me for emergencies like that \u2026 It was a tough situation. I\u2019ll talk to your mum\u201d and then do that. Talk to your ex. Say \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know why Mark called me, I don\u2019t know who else is in you life, and I don\u2019t know if I was his first or fifth option\u2026but if he wants to call me for emergencies I am ok with that. He\u2019s about to go through puberty \u2026 a time when there\u2019s naturally a lot of separation from parents and a need to be guided. If you think I\u2019m ok, I\u2019m ok with that. Happy to hang with Mark on occasion and be a \u2018safe and separate uncle\u2019 if that is what he needs\u201d.   \n\n\nObviously only offer that if you are ok with it. Take the uncle stuff out if you aren\u2019t ok but still happy to do the random middle of the night calls.   \n\n\nYour ex is probably embarrassed that you were the only person Mark was able to get ahold of in an emergency and wants to be more successful than that in your eyes. No one wants to be the pity ex!", "NTA - you\u2019re a good man.", "NTA. I was ready for you to say that you didn't go to Mark when he needed you and I was going to be so disappointed and sad for him. \n\nYou did the right thing. You helped Mark when he needed you most and when he had no other trusted adult around to be there for him while his mom was unconscious. \n\nMaya just went though a lot and might not be thinking clearly, so I would give her the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully, she will realize this.", "NAH. \n\nOn the one hand, Mark needed someone. He called you. You stepped up. I'm sure Mark really appreciated it. Who knows what might have happened if he had to go through this without anyone else there. I've been in an accident and they are TERRIFYING as an adult. I cannot imagine how it must have been like for a kid between 10-12 with his only parent. \n\nOn the other hand, Maya is your ex. After waking up from being unconscious due to an accident, it makes sense she might not be comfortable seeing you there. \n\nHere's what I suggest; write Maya a letter. Apologize again for showing up and making her uncomfortable. Reiterate that you came to help Mark at his request when he was scared and vulnerable and in need of support. Tell her if she would rather you not contact her and Mark again that you'll respect her wishes, but that if she needs any help with anything during her recovery you'd be willing to help in whatever capacity she and you would both be comfortable with, as a friend (if that's something you'd want to do). Wish her a speedy recovery and that you wish her and Mark well. \n\nAfter that, walk away knowing you did what you could, and that you did right by a scared pre-teen boy who called you in his hour of need.", "You did the right thing. The harder thing is what is the right thing now. Because if she was properly injured they probably both need help now, and it sounds like it's possible they don't have anyone else to help. And she is never going to ask you because of her probably knee jerk reaction at the hospital. I think you need to call and check in on her. But don't apologise for going to the hospital or calling her. Just say why you've done it.", "NTA and the arrogance of the mother to think only of herself after you explained to her the reason you were there for. She didn\u2019t care in that moment that her son was so scared and he called you for support shows the ending of your relationship with seemed right cos it appears so arrogant", "INFO: does Maya have a significant other, and were they there at the hospital waiting with Mark? If not, NTA. You responded to a plea for help from a 12 year old whose Mom was unconscious. Gets greyer if there's a new relationship, and you hung around till she woke up.  \nEdit to fix a weird as hell autocorrect.", "NAH.\n\nYou were a good person for going over there to help Mark.  When your ex woke up, she was probably feeling scared, confused and vulnerable so she freaked out when she saw you.  Hopefully she'll calm down in a day or two and apologize to you.", "NAH.", "NAH - you did the right thing. Mark will always remember the kindness and I\u2019m sure Maya will be appreciative in time too. As others have said, I\u2019m going to assume it was a knee jerk reaction to say you shouldn\u2019t have gone. Maybe she was embarrassed that out of everyone in their lives Mark called and inconvenienced you, an ex of 2 years past, rather than call someone who is currently still a part of their every day lives. I think the shock of seeing you, knowing you\u2019d probably say for hours with a child that\u2019s not part of your life any more made her worry and/or feel ashamed that he didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to? \n\nI\u2019m only basing that on how I would feel if I were in her position. I\u2019d hate to think my child had been sat with someone who didn\u2019t want to be there and could possibly be annoyed with them/me. Not saying you were because your tone in the post comes across as very caring. \n\nAs a mum, thank you for going. If Maya doesn\u2019t appreciate it she\u2019s daft. Mark always will though and I think that\u2019s the most important thing.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing, but if she just woke up from a coma, she very likely wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Give her some grace on account of the physical and mental trauma she suffered, it very well may have influenced her reaction.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll be able to reevaluate her reaction after she\u2019s had some time to recover and thank you for being there for her son.", "NTA.  I think you were being a really good person to be there for Mark.  Hopefully, she was just surprised to see you there and probably felt a bit vulnerable - I'd guess she's really appreciative that you could be there for her son.  If not, she should be. \n\nediting to say that NAH is probably more appropriate assuming she comes to appreciate that you came for her son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maya had to deal with it and seeing you, knowing that the two of you weren\u2019t getting back together means that Mark would have to suffer all over again. \nI suggest that when Maya feels better, the two of you should talk.

This might be why she told you to get out.\n\nBut the major concern here is the child. I\u2019d stress that while the romantic relationship maybe over, it doesn\u2019t mean you stopped caring for them.\n\nIf handled carefully, you might end up with a new type of relationship, one based on friendship.\n\nI\u2019d also let Mark know you want him to call you in an emergency.

He asked if I could come and pick him up from school (it was 11 pm). I said sit tight I will be there as quick as I can. We (hubby was driving) we\u2019re in the way. He calls me and said dad showed up, dads phone died and moms was in the car. I said that is great. Later I told him I was proud of him for calling a trusted adult and he did good. His parents were very grateful that I was there and was willing to get him. My friend and her hubby have no parents as they have passed and my hubby and I are their \u201cgrandparents\u201d.

She was just driving along with her son, then she wakes in a hospital, in pain, with monitors beeping around her, her son distraught and a man she dated 2 years ago staring down at her.\n\nPersonally, I'd probably be terrified I'd suffered some kind of brain injury and had amnesia. \"Why are you here, I thought we broke up, did we get back together and I've lost 2 years worth of memories?!\"\n\nBut Mark needed you and you showed up (literally and figuratively). You're a good person for staying with him while he waited for his mom to wake up. I do not doubt you were a rock that kept him from completely losing it; there's nothing more terrifying than seeing your parent lying in a hospital bed and being completely unable to help them.\n\nYour being there was actually a real, physical and direct thing she could focus on and, frankly, take it out on.\n\nIf I were you, if you have a contact number for Mark, perhaps send him a text to check in on him, apologise again for causing his mother to be upset, and that you understand she was likely freaked out by everything that had happened.

Hopefully, now she's had a bit of time, she'll acknowledge that you did a good and kind thing, and is grateful.", "NTA", "She was unconscious and her child was alone.

If anything happens to his mom, you may be the only one who he could turn to. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I hope that when she recovers she comes to her senses and calls you to thank you. It was a very loving thing to do for a child who is no longer in your life.", "NAH. \n\nYou were called, in distress, and you were one of the first people, perhaps the first person that he rang. \n\nHaving said that, she just came out of unconsciousness, after a car accident! Y\u2019know, one might be a little disoriented? This isn\u2019t about you doing anything _wrong_, it\u2019s about her flailing around and being in shock. Anyone considering her TA for that should reconsider their grasp on reality. \n\nIndeed, as someone who has been with his wife recovering from a traumatic brain injury this year, I have particular insight. The brain injury this year was caused by a pickup truck taking a corner and mounting the footpath and knocking her flying and then driving off at speed. She was wearing a helmet because she was walking her scooter, which was completely shattered. Do the math on that. The realisation in treating this was that she had a previous TBI because she\u2019d been in a major car accident years ago when a drunk teenage driver crossed multiple lanes and totalled the car in which she was a passenger. Because the US healthcare system is so screwed and often works as multiple contractors who don\u2019t share information, although she was treated for her broken pelvis, broken knees, broken ankles, dislocated shoulders (so much for her professional dance career!) they never assessed her head. \n\nAll of this is to say it\u2019s a NAH situation. You answered the call and you are a good human on so many levels. She was in profound distress, had been unconscious, and cannot possibly have escaped a head injury altogether \u2014 the only question will be the degree. \n\nThere\u2019s a separate issue to be confronted once the dust settles on this, which is to try to ask about why Mark reached out to you, because this seems to me to likely speak of him wanting a relationship. That is not unusual. While it\u2019s not co-parenting per se, if it\u2019s really about the wellbeing of a child, people have to consider that we can and should have more nuanced ideas of what familial connections can be, now. \n\nAnd I say this as an extra father/brother/uncle of a kid of a friend who I never dated at all.", "NAH\n\nYou were there for Mark when he needed you. Maya was presumably stressed, out of it and self-conscious after waking up and didn\u2019t want you there, which is her choice. I don\u2019t think either one of you did anything wrong.", "NTA. Mark needed someone to be there. You did the right thing.", "You did the right thing.", "NTA.   You did the right thing.   But if maya is in the hospital, who is going to watch mark?", "NTA She was probably confused, and looked like shit. Not exactly what you want your ex to see, and was completely taken off guard by your presence. Don't be offended by her initial reaction. She'll appreciate it later on. You did the right thing.", "Nta - he needed support and he wanted you there. She might have been mad in the moment but she was in an accident, injured and probably shocked to see you. Don\u2019t take it personally. You did right", "Boy needed help, you helped. About as far from asshole as you can get.", "NTA - you made a promise to Mark that he could call you if he ever needed to. He called when he needed help and you were there. \n\nHe now knows for certain you are good for your word. He will want to be the same way.", "NAH. \n\nMark was terrified and asked the only person he trusted in that moment to come to him. \n\nDespite your initial reservations, you got yourself to that hospital and let that child know he wasn\u2019t alone in this world. \n\nMaya did absolutely nothing wrong either. I\u2019ve known people that have lost consciousness, and when they wake up, they think they\u2019re still in the moment before they blacked out - my friend woke up screaming because she thought that the car coming at her was still there several hours later. Moreover, she was probably confused and could have even thought you were someone else and reacted that way without really realizing it was actually you. \n\nI think absolutely everyone in this circumstance did everything they could to do what was right. Mark called an adult he trusted, the adult proved he was worthy of that trust, the doctor and nurses helped a mother regain consciousness, and the mother did her part to fight to wake up. \n\nWere there mistakes? Absolutely. Did she handle it the best way possible? No. But in this, please extend her some grace. She went through a hell of an ordeal, and she wasn\u2019t reacting rationally. You did nothing wrong. I don\u2019t know if you guys broke up on bad terms or not, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You did the best you could in the circumstances to ease the fears of a frightened little boy. \n\nOP, thank you.

I think you're a person with a very strong moral code in a walking the walk kind of way.  Maya was ungrateful and not thinking about what was best for her son.  At all.\n\nNTA", "NAH. You absolutely did the right thing by taking care of Mark; Maya's reaction can be excused by the fact that she had just woken up from a very traumatic event and she was very surprised to see you there.", "NTA you're a good person\nBeing there for Mark which he needed", "NTA. You are such a good man that I am tearing up a little. Thank you for doing the right thing.\n\nYou might write a text to Mark explaining that he can still trust you and call you if he ever needs to again. Just in case the ending of it made him feeling stupid for calling you.\n\nIf Maya does the right thing, she will apologize and thank you when she comes to her senses. But that doesn't matter. What matters is what you did for the boy.", "NTA at all\n\nYou are a lovely person for being there for Mark.", "NAH- it's gotta be incredibly startling to wake up from a life threatening accident to find you are in the hospital having been unconscious for several hours with your son and a man you haven't seen in 2 years. But in an emergency like this, involving a young child I think you did the best you could. Hospital staff typically includes daycares and social work, but a kind, safe, human that the child knows is almost always a better option. She had no living relatives, and seemingly no emergency contact could be reached since paramedics and doctors didn't call one and they were alone when you arrived. You did a nice thing for a kid, with no expectation of anything in return. You may never get a thank you, but he will always remember that.", "NTA. You did a good thing for him. As you mentioned, he doesn't have anyone else and asked for your help in a dire situation. She might reconsider in future and suck her pride and thank you next time. This for sure is a traumatising situatiation for Mark and she might gray rock him. He will probably lose his teens to tough up as he will face the world alone.", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone in the situation was wrong. Your ex woke up from a really traumatic experience and asked you to leave. Your exes son called you in a panic. You showed up to sit with him. I don\u2019t think anyone is wrong for how they acted", "NTA . You did the right thing .", "Nta\n\nYou took care of Mark. There was no one else. And you left when she asked you to. Just move on. \n\nShe should have had an emergency plan worked out.", "NTA, Mark is 11 for God's sake! What a horrible situation for him to be alone in. You did a good thing.", "NTA that you went to the hospital and also good for you to leave when asked. The end.", "NTA\n\nYour ex may have panicked for whatever reason but what you did was amazing.\n\nThere are people who make assurances that they will be there for you but don't follow through. You not only promised and fulfilled the promise, you showed a young boy what he's allowed to expect in life and what he should do, too. Thank you for leading by example and not letting this kid feel alone while he navigated a difficult time. \n\nI am proud of you and thankful for you.", "NTA  \n\n\nI can not say why she did it but you did the right thing.", "Nta and I doubt she thinks so either. Sounds like she was literally unconscious before booting you out and was likely feeling muddled and vulnerable. You're a good person and a good father figure. I'd do it again should it come up again.", " NTA - you supported Mark. You are a good person.", "You are definitely NTA, but I would question how amicable your breakup really was. Unless you can chalk up her behavior to being injured and/or being on meds, it seems like she is harboring some major resentment towards you. Maybe with some time, you can reach out and ask her why she responded so negatively. Hopefully, you can get a chance to explain that you were just responding to her son being upset and under a ton of stress.", "You helped your target audience which was Mark.  Maya is an adult and is capable of processing her own emotions.  Mark  is not in that same boat.  He needed a familiar adult while his mother was incapacitated.  You showed up when asked to show up and left when asked to leave, you did your job.  NTA", "Definitely NTA.  Quite the opposite. OP did Mark a huge favor by coming through for him. He did Maya a big favor too even though she didn't see it that way that night.\n\nAs much as he probably doesn't want to speak to Maya, OP should call her and get this straightened out. If she doesn't want her son calling OP, Maya has to give him other people's numbers to call in an emergency. OP should tell her again he only came because he son asked. If she still is hostile and doesn't apologize for her nasty words at the hospital, then I would say that this wasn't the friendly breakup that OP described and thought had occurred. Maya sees things differently.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing, but she was just in a car accident and was probably in pain, I would just have grace and let her be mad\n\nBut know you did right by that kid, I can\u2019t imagine how terrified he was", "You\u2019re a great guy and you did a good deed.", "NTA... I had a 7 year relationship with a single mother. It ended horribly due to her cheating, but if her daughter ever called and needed me, I would drop everything and run to her.\n\nYour ex may have lashed out and not appreciated you, but I promise you did the right thing for that little boy.\n\nMaybe Mom will thank you after the shock of the accident and from seeing you wears off.\nIf she doesn't, just know how grateful the kid is, and that you are certainly not an asshole for being there for him.", "NTA. That said if I was her I'd probably act the same initially. Waking up after an accident, especially if she was given any meds, she was probably not in her right mind. Even if she was, I'm sure she was going through a number of emotions and some level of shock and confusion. \n\nAlso contact Hallmark, sounds like a good movie.", "NTA, you did the right thing.", "NTA Mark didn't know who to call, so he called the person who has made him feel safe when he was little.  There is nothing wrong with that. You didn't overstep anything, you were helping a child you helped raise for several years.", "NTA, it was a kind and compassionate thing for you to do.", "NTA you did the right thing.", "NTA it sucks that Maya leads her life that the only person who her son thought to call was the ex boyfriend.\n\nDoes she not have friends?  I\u2019m very concerned for her son that she pushed you away in this circumstance.", "It may have been painful for her to see you there, but you did the right thing. She should really acknowledge that.\n\nNTA", "Question\u2026Does Maya have another boyfriend? It could cause issues if her ex shows up when she\u2019s in another relationship. However, there is nothing wrong with being a solid support for a kid.", "*Very much NTA*.\n\nI wouldn't hold this against Maya either - she just woke up from a car accident. Her response was not *right*, but given the situation I wouldn't expect a better one. That's not her fault.", "NTA. You told a kid that he could call you in an emergency, and he did. I'm glad that you were there for him. You also did the right thing when Mom woke up.\n\nI hope that he stays in touch with you as he gets older. This situation reflects well on your character.", "When I passed out in front of my 5 year old she called her father, my ex and he came straight over and I was very appreciative now at 6 she knows how to call my boyfriend but will still call her dad in caseof emergency. This is absolutely fine with all of us. We all care for each other. Been friends along time. And we all love her very much", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. You were there to support a child when he was terrified and didn't know what to do. You also respectfully left once your ex was awake and out of the woods. \n\nYou weren't there for her. You were there for Mark. That probably means a great deal to him to know that, no matter how much time has passed, he can still count on you. That's a big deal.", "NTA - I\u2019d be there for any child.", "NTA and I hope you reach out to Mark to ensure he knows you are still reachable.", "NTA\n\nYou answered a child in need when they needed help. Hopefully Maya will come to her senses and realize that you were being a good human in that moment, nothing more, and thank you for being there for her son when she couldn't be. It's sweet that after all this time, Mark felt like he could trust you.", "NTA at all\n\nStepping up for a child in need in that situation is fine in my opinion. At the end of the day that boy will remember that you were there for him and pay it forward if the opportunity is available", "Mom was literally unconscious and the kid had nobody else to call apparently. My guess is mom is seeing some new and when she woke up she panicked that her ex was there, or something along those lines. She was probably out of it still if she had just regained consciousness. Assuming she\u2019s a reasonable person, which it sounds like she is, I highly doubt she\u2019s actually upset at you for coming OP. She probably just was taken by surprise/panicked and lashed out at you. I bet in retrospect she understands why you would come, and is probably glad at least *someone* was there with her scared child while she was unconscious.", "Yeah, OP just taught Mark an important lesson: that he can rely on people to be there for him when he\u2019s alone and scared. Maya might have good reason for not wanting him there after she came to, but OP was there for the kid when he was needed. \n\nNTA.", ">You would have been a bit of an asshole if you HADN'T gone.\n\nThat's a hot take in this sub where seemingly only legal and technical obligations are moral obligations.", "Disagree with N-A-H .  Maya is an asshole.  Her son Mark was panicked and called OP.  OP went to the hospital only because he was asked to by Mark.  OP did the right thing.  Maya should have thanked him.  NTA.", "When I was only a couple years older than this kid, I got a text that my mom broke her back. She was a single mom and I was an only child, even as a 13 year old I was worried about what would happen to us if my mom couldn\u2019t work. This kid was probably worried about what would happen to him if he lost his mother, and that\u2019s a hard place to be.", "NTA, agree. Maya is also probably under extreme stress and feeling very vulnerable, and may not be able to appreciate what you did. Sometimes the deed has to be its own reward. You did good.", "I assume you also honored her wishes for you to leave. If so, totally NTA.", "That was my thought. She has a new someone. She may have been miffed her son called OP and not the new guy. But will probably recognize OP did not everstep. In fact should be happy her son still has someone he can count on in an emergency.", "My goodness\u2026think properly and deeper. It probably has nothing to do with a new partner and has everything to do with the fact he was an ex there with her child and her momma bear kicked in and wants to protect her child from getting attached to somebody she isn\u2019t.", " She was freshly conscious after being in an accident. Her emotions are allowed to be all over the place. Let's cut her some slack. She didn't do anything wrong either.", "She for all we know is experiencing the effects of temporary or permanent brain damage having just come out of a car accident. Some form of a concussion is atleast expected and a primary effect of that is behavioral abnormality. \n\nOn top of that to be disorientation of what she\u2019s going through and the trauma. \n\nFrankly anything other than a horrifically bad response from her is completely understandable", "She wasn't just asleep, she was unconscious. If you are waking up from being unconscious, you are not thinking clearly. She was probably extremely confused about where she was, why she was there, and why her ex was with her kid while she was out of it. People say far ruder things coming off of anesthesia than what she said", " She's a major league  AH. She should be happy he was there for her kid. What if she was in the hospital for awhile?", "I would not consider her to be any kind of an AH based on this snippet when she was hospitalized and unconscious.", "Maya has literally just woken up after a car accident. She\u2019s shocked, confused and likely got a brain injury. \n\nWe can give her grace for not reacting well.", "That seems a bit harsh. Maya experienced what could be life-alterimg trauma. She is likely scared and vulnerable, and we can be tricky when we're in that state. I'd give her some grace.", "You sure expect a lot of  people with head trauma... ew.", "Right, because the first thing a women gaining consciousness after a bad crash should do is thank people\u2026 clown", "You're being a bit silly.", "She probably wasn\u2019t thinking at her very clearest at that moment. She woke up, was confused about why you were there and disinclined to think positively of you, and reacted poorly.\n\nHopefully after she\u2019s fully herself again and thought about it for a while she\u2019ll realize that you did a very kind and caring thing for her son. You\u2019re a good person, OP. Thank you for doing the right thing, even if your ex doesn\u2019t see it that way.", "Besides stress Maya may have been given drugs.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard to imagine once her head clears she really comes to the conclusion OP should\u2019ve told her panicking son who just got in an accident and who\u2019s mother was unconscious to \u201cget lost\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t coming. Unless OP is lying and the relationship ended on *really* bad terms I guess. But if anything she\u2019d be more upset at her son for calling op in the first place, which I don\u2019t think would be very fair or reasonable either, considering he just went through a traumatic event and needed someone he trusted there with him. But the last person she could rationalize blaming is OP. OP just straight up did what was right. The alternative option was telling a panicking traumatized kid to suck it up and figure it out on his own. Which is empirically the *wrong* the to do. NTA at all op, forgot to include that part initially. Assuming events went down as you describe, you quite literally did nothing wrong here. And I doubt she really think your TA once her head clears and she thinks the situation all the way through.", "Agree. I recall a letter to an advice columnist several years ago (Carolyn Hax, I think) around an incident where a late 20-something guy had a brain tumor. Had surgery to remove it...so BRAIN surgery. In recovery the guy did not recognize his mother but when his MIL came into the room, he was all excited and happy to see her. Mom bursts into tears and runs out of the room. Is comforted in the hospital cafeteria by her husband and daughter. It is months later and she is still fixated on her son not recognizing her at that moment to the point of not wanting to be around him. So she is asking the advice columnist what to do. Basically, the answer was \"get over it; your son had BRAIN SURGERY and you are fixated on what he said the moment he regained consciousness\". \n\nI see Maya as that son. Who knows how bad she was injured and what drugs she was on? OP was there for the son and that is fine.", "Not to mention any drugs she may have been given! They can be super disorienting on top of her accident t", "Also, if they put her under for emergency surgery, anesthesia is known for making people loopy when they wake up. She may not even know she was in an accident.", "She has a car accident and a concussion, she wakes up disoriented and her ex is there. The reaction isn\u2019t surprising.\n\nTop tip - ignore anything anyone says after being unconscious or coming out of anaesthesia. They are literally not in their right mind. Don\u2019t be judgmental and maybe laugh about it later.", "My dad came out of a 2 week stint in a coma FURIOUS that I was there. He was so confused and upset and disoriented that he thought I was his sister whom he despises. Prolonged unconsciousness and head injuries can do crazy things to someone's personality and they definitely deserve grace and compassion- Maya will likely either not remember the incident at all or be upset with herself once she's herself again.", "That\u2019s a reason, not an excuse.\n\nBeing labelled the AH for her behaviour is fine. There\u2019 no punishment that she needs grace and understanding for, other than perhaps apologizing to OP and Mark. The only more grace she could be given is saying that her behaviour and response were fine and it was everyone else\u2019s fault, which reverses the situation.", ">I mean if there was some animosity on her end then you may be the ahole. \n\nOP still wouldn't be an asshole. Leaving Mark alone would have made OP an asshole, regardless of any animosity.", "And a head injury if she was knocked unconcious. It can make behaviour a bit off\n\nEdited to add: thank you for showing up for a worried kid OP. NTA", "Or maybe the fights that lead to them breaking up were all driving related, with op saying how much of a dangerous driver Maya was, and then, after a car crash, the first thing she sees is him, and thinks he came to gloat.\n\nIs that too much reddit for me today?", "I mean, she's in pain, just went a traumatic event, stressed and worried about her kid, had been knocked unconscious, and was likely given heavy medication. I think it's fair to say she wasn't fully present and herself in the moment.", "Or medication", " Or she might just be an AH, which is much more likely", "Oof, I love Carolyn. She doesn't dance around telling LWs to shape up.", "Calling her an asshole implies intent that can\u2019t really be there with a person who has a head injury and was most likely sedated for a long period of time. Your false dichotomy is silly.", "If we can\u2019t give grace and understanding to someone who has just woken up hours after a bad car accident, then who do we give grace and understanding to?", "Yeah said \u2018\u2019may\u201d - who knows what their situation is, my point being two sides to every story and he should not contact her or Mark again at this point", "Occam\u2019s Razor says \u2018person who is unconscious, who wakes up suddenly, from a car accident, where the only question as to head injury is the degree to which it will have happened, and even a minor one will be impactful\u2019 is going to react with disoriented, startled, highly emotional behaviour. \n\nAnd I say this as someone with a profoundly loving relationship with my wife, in the best relationship of our lives, where when she woke up from a pickup truck mounting a footpath and sending her flying and smashing her helmet, yelled \u2018get the fuck away from me!\u2019 and tried to crawl away when she saw me. \n\nY\u2019know, not an asshole. A person in profound distress, where I had the capability to not take it as a blow to my ego because the focus was on pain.", "We can\u2019t know, and thus the reason to give her a bit of grace at the moment and let it slide.", "Plus, she's likely still in the hospital considering her injuries were severe enough to be unconscious for *several hours*. Either she suffered a major head injury or she had to be heavily sedated for medical personnel to tend to her injuries.", ">Yeah said \u2018\u2019may\u201d\n\nI'm aware, my opinion stands. \n\n>who knows what their situation is\n\nShort of OP being abusive, I don't find it particularly relevant to whether or not he is the asshole. \n\n>he should not contact her or Mark again at this point\n\nI don't necessarily think OP should contact them either. But if Mark ever calls in a similar situation, then OP should still go, regardless of what the ex wants. Sometimes, doing the right thing isn't popular."]}
