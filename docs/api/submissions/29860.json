She has a son, Mark. He was 4 when I started dating Maya. Mark's father, Maya's husband, unfortunately passed away when he was still a baby so he has no memory of him.\n\nMe and Maya got along quite well and our relationship proceeded steadily and without too many problems. In time, I built a good relationship with Mark too and by the time he was 7, we were a good trio. Unfortunately my relationship with Maya ended 2 years ago. It was nobody's fault. There was no cheating or abuse involved. We simply had some problems and we came to the conclusion it was better to break up.\n\nLast week I got a call in the middle of the night: it was Mark calling. When I was still dating Maya, I had given him my phone number and told him to call if he was ever in trouble and needed help. He had never called since me and Maya broke up but that night he was panicking; he called and he told me that he and Maya had a car accident. He was ok but Maya was injured and they had been taken to the hospital. I pondered on what to do but decided to go to the hospital. Maya has no living relatives and Mark told me he was alone so I went there mostly to take care of Mark.\n\nWhen I arrived, Maya was still unconscious so I stayed with Mark for several hours, until she regained consciousness. When she saw me, she asked why I was there and I told her about Mark calling me.\n\nShe said I should not have come and forced me to leave. At the time, I apologized and left because I thought I had overstepped her boundaries but now, thinking back, I don't think I did anything wrong. Mark was panicking and he called the person he wanted by his side in that moment. Was it wrong for me to come?

Mark must have felt overwhelmed and alone,  I\u2019m sure you helped his state of mind by just being there.  You left when you were no longer needed.", "NTA. He looked up to you as a father figure and thought of you. Okay, Mom is upset, but he wanted you there.", "NTA. Mark is what, 11 or 12? He needs someone to look after him. You would have been a bit of an asshole if you HADN'T gone.", "NTA. You were doing a good deed looking out for her kid.", "I think what you did was really sweet.", "NTA I think in time she may evaluate it differently.....you're a good person...who would leave a child alone in that situation? Try not to dwell on it.", "NTA. Here's the thing.. what if she *hadn't* woken up relatively quickly?   \nThe hospital would have had a social worker put him in an emergency foster situation, so he would have been (relatively) safe, but he likely would also have been unable to visit his mother or attend his regular school.  \nYes, his mom was upset, and maybe reasonably so considering her situation and the confusion. But somebody needs to let that kid know he didn't do anything wrong. God forbid something should happen in the future and he has no one he can call.", "NAH, you're her ex so understandable she didn't really want you there. You also weren't in a position to get more information on what you should do until she woke up. This is just all around a rough one", "NTA  \nwhat you did was amazing, i hope it helped Mark!  \nI understand Maya as well, she was,hurt, vulnerable you do not want an ex there.", "NAH - A young boy is afraid for his mother and all alone while she is injured.  This wasn\u2019t an attempt to revisit a relationship, it\u2019s about taking care of a kid who is scared when their primary adult is in an emergency situation.  It might have been a knee-jerk reaction at being surprised by your presence, but she might realize after some thought that it was right for you to show up when Mark called you in a panic.  How cold would it have been to say No anyway?", "NTA\n\nYou did good..  and she'll realise this soon enough...", "No. You were very kind to do so. He won\u2019t forget it.", "How terrifying for mark. You showed him you\u2019ll be there for him. He was probably scared he could end up completely and utterly alone. What you did was a very good thing.", "Nah - you're not wrong for going but I don't think it's fair to judge her reaction in the moment", "NAH. If I was in a car accident that left me u conscious for hours I probably wouldn\u2019t want to wake up to see my ex. However you weren\u2019t wrong to go to the hospital when Mark called. \n\nApologizing and leaving was the right move. Don\u2019t get hung up on the idea that you were in the right\u2014so was she.", "NTA. You were helping a kid who needed help and looked to you. \n\nHopefully she realizes with some time that you meant no harm. Until then, she\u2019s the AH.", "Nah as it stands. You were right to go, and she just woke up after a serious car accident and, I assume, drugs. In a completely non-put-down way, her brain was not working super well right then. She might even have thought you were saying mark called you to come and see her, rather than to come be with him. \n\nQuick story as example: when I was in labour, my parents arrived at the hospital to come support. I invited them, I knew they were coming, and when the nurse told me they were there, I said don\u2019t let them in\u2026because my brain\u2019s panic response was \u2018I can\u2019t make small talk right now!\u2019 No one was expecting polite chitchat, and yet.", "Nta. It was a very kind thing you did. A young boy was troubled and you stepped in to help. Her reaction gives me thought that the relationship  did not end as amicably  as you think, at least from her side.", "NTA. You sound too good for her.", "NTA and I\u2019m pretty sure once she has had some time to think about things she will realize you did the right thing.", "NTA", "no, you didn't do anything wrong. Maybe later Maya will realize that, but what you did for Mark was priceless. Sometimes doing the right thing makes other people upset. Oh well, I'm sure you can live with that better than the thought of that poor kid going through that alone", "Oh. No, you are very definitely not TA. It was lovely of you to go when he needed you.", "NTA. You did a very kind thing.  Not sure why she got so upset, especially when your breakup was mutual.", "Nta I get it she woke up and it was shocking but she really needs to think.", "NTA. He was scared, and he called you. He knows he can reach out and that's important.", "NTA. You did the right thing for the young man. There are a number of reasons she might not have wanted you to see her in that setting. Give it some time and then check in to ensure they both have recovered. You may not have a romantic relationship anymore, but that doesn't preclude you from being a good friend.", "NTA - Mark called you, you showed up, and you respected Maya\u2019s boundaries by apologizing and leaving when she told you to.  I\u2019m sure Mark appreciated you being there with him and I\u2019m sorry to hear that he may not have a very big support system.  :/", "You were damned either way. \n\nBut Id rather my ex showed than not.", "You did not do anything wrong.\n\nMark called you. He was scared and needed someone he trusted. That was you. You stepped up and went there for him. NTA", "NTA. You did what any decent person would do in the situation.", "NTA - I think it was so kind of you to go and comfort Mark.\nI hope when she is thinking clearly she apologizes and thanks you", "NTA. But she wasn't expecting to see you and you should have left without being forced.I dont think it was that you were there supporting her son it was that you were there in her room while she was unconscious. Hopefully once/if she gets over you being there while she was vulnerable without her knowledge she will thank you for being there for her son. .", "NTA.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Mark needed your support while his mother was unconscious and you were there for him.  He'll remember that.", "A 11 year old youve raised for half his life calls you crying and asks you to come see him because his only parent is hospitalised, you\u2019d have to be completely apathetic to say no to him. \n\nDo remember that you went there for him and not for your ex, that can really shift the perspective for you", "You're very much NTA.  Mark was obviously frightened and upset.  You, being a decent human being, were there to support him emotionally. But heaven forbid he developed a delayed medical issue as a result of the accident, at least you were there and could have gotten the attention of medical personnel to help him.  \n\nI'm honestly hoping that Maya's not really an AH either.  It was probably disconcerting for her to wake up in the hospital injured and seeing her ex.  You respected her wishes and left when she asked you to.  Hopefully she'll realize you were being a good guy to Mark when he really needed someone, and thank you for being there for him (and hopefully apologize too).", "NTA\n\nYou did a good and kind thing for Mark.\n\nMaya will realise this once she's on the road to recovery.  She's still traumatised. \n\nWho will look after him if she has to stay overnight in hospital?", "Definitely NTA", "NTA SO MUCH NTA. You were there for a child when he needed you.", "You were being a good human - I hope she becomes well enough to see that and simply thank you", "I wonder what is going on behind the scenes with her to lash out on you.\n\nFirst, you claim the break up was amicable. Which would suggest she doesn't hate you or amything like that. Mark at least doesn't hate you. In fact, he loves you. Why else would you be in his thoughts during such a bad situation?\n\nI guess you are single, as you would have included a partner in this, and we can only assume your ex is single, or mark may have phoned them? Or perhaps he doesn't have her currect boyfriend's contact details so you were second choice? That is my thoughts. Perhaps she didn't want you there in case her current boyfriend shows up and sees you there as well.\n\nEither way, NTA. And if she was just angry you were there in case her boyfriend shows up, that is understandable. If not, I have no reason other than shock and perhaps drugs in her system (morphine, etc) why she'd act like that.", "NTA, while Maya might not have wanted to see you, Mark *needed* you. Maya was unconscious and didn't really want any comfort, but Mark was conscious, scared, and needed someone he trusted. \n\nAlso, OP, Mayas feelings about the whole thing might be partly affected by trauma of a crash, as well as the shock of seeing you there and then also leftover feelings of the breakup.", "NTA. You supported a child when you were asked to. She was traumatized and I wouldn't take it too personally. Thank you for being a good human.", "NTA. You were there for a child.  Good on you.", "You did absolutely nothing wrong. You 100% did the right thing. A child called you for help and you answered that call.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. She owes you a serious apology. He needed you and you were there. She should be grateful.", "NTA hopefully when things get back to normal she will realize Mike needed someone there for him to lean on.", "You did a very kind thing for a frightened young man. Good on you. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.   \nMark called the person who he trusted to help him in that moment.   \nSend Mark a text saying something like \u201cI am ok with your calling me for emergencies like that \u2026 It was a tough situation. I\u2019ll talk to your mum\u201d and then do that. Talk to your ex. Say \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know why Mark called me, I don\u2019t know who else is in you life, and I don\u2019t know if I was his first or fifth option\u2026but if he wants to call me for emergencies I am ok with that. He\u2019s about to go through puberty \u2026 a time when there\u2019s naturally a lot of separation from parents and a need to be guided. If you think I\u2019m ok, I\u2019m ok with that. Happy to hang with Mark on occasion and be a \u2018safe and separate uncle\u2019 if that is what he needs\u201d.   \n\n\nObviously only offer that if you are ok with it. Take the uncle stuff out if you aren\u2019t ok but still happy to do the random middle of the night calls.   \n\n\nYour ex is probably embarrassed that you were the only person Mark was able to get ahold of in an emergency and wants to be more successful than that in your eyes. No one wants to be the pity ex!", "NTA - you\u2019re a good man.", "NTA. I was ready for you to say that you didn't go to Mark when he needed you and I was going to be so disappointed and sad for him. \n\nYou did the right thing. You helped Mark when he needed you most and when he had no other trusted adult around to be there for him while his mom was unconscious. \n\nMaya just went though a lot and might not be thinking clearly, so I would give her the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully, she will realize this.", "NAH. \n\nOn the one hand, Mark needed someone. He called you. You stepped up. I'm sure Mark really appreciated it. Who knows what might have happened if he had to go through this without anyone else there. I've been in an accident and they are TERRIFYING as an adult. I cannot imagine how it must have been like for a kid between 10-12 with his only parent. \n\nOn the other hand, Maya is your ex. After waking up from being unconscious due to an accident, it makes sense she might not be comfortable seeing you there. \n\nHere's what I suggest; write Maya a letter. Apologize again for showing up and making her uncomfortable. Reiterate that you came to help Mark at his request when he was scared and vulnerable and in need of support. Tell her if she would rather you not contact her and Mark again that you'll respect her wishes, but that if she needs any help with anything during her recovery you'd be willing to help in whatever capacity she and you would both be comfortable with, as a friend (if that's something you'd want to do). Wish her a speedy recovery and that you wish her and Mark well. \n\nAfter that, walk away knowing you did what you could, and that you did right by a scared pre-teen boy who called you in his hour of need.", "You did the right thing. The harder thing is what is the right thing now. Because if she was properly injured they probably both need help now, and it sounds like it's possible they don't have anyone else to help. And she is never going to ask you because of her probably knee jerk reaction at the hospital. I think you need to call and check in on her. But don't apologise for going to the hospital or calling her. Just say why you've done it.", "NTA and the arrogance of the mother to think only of herself after you explained to her the reason you were there for. She didn\u2019t care in that moment that her son was so scared and he called you for support shows the ending of your relationship with seemed right cos it appears so arrogant", "INFO: does Maya have a significant other, and were they there at the hospital waiting with Mark? If not, NTA. You responded to a plea for help from a 12 year old whose Mom was unconscious. Gets greyer if there's a new relationship, and you hung around till she woke up.  \nEdit to fix a weird as hell autocorrect.", "NAH.\n\nYou were a good person for going over there to help Mark.  When your ex woke up, she was probably feeling scared, confused and vulnerable so she freaked out when she saw you.  Hopefully she'll calm down in a day or two and apologize to you.", "NAH.", "NAH - you did the right thing. Mark will always remember the kindness and I\u2019m sure Maya will be appreciative in time too. As others have said, I\u2019m going to assume it was a knee jerk reaction to say you shouldn\u2019t have gone. Maybe she was embarrassed that out of everyone in their lives Mark called and inconvenienced you, an ex of 2 years past, rather than call someone who is currently still a part of their every day lives. I think the shock of seeing you, knowing you\u2019d probably say for hours with a child that\u2019s not part of your life any more made her worry and/or feel ashamed that he didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to? \n\nI\u2019m only basing that on how I would feel if I were in her position. I\u2019d hate to think my child had been sat with someone who didn\u2019t want to be there and could possibly be annoyed with them/me. Not saying you were because your tone in the post comes across as very caring. \n\nAs a mum, thank you for going. If Maya doesn\u2019t appreciate it she\u2019s daft. Mark always will though and I think that\u2019s the most important thing.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing, but if she just woke up from a coma, she very likely wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Give her some grace on account of the physical and mental trauma she suffered, it very well may have influenced her reaction.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll be able to reevaluate her reaction after she\u2019s had some time to recover and thank you for being there for her son.", "NTA.  I think you were being a really good person to be there for Mark.  Hopefully, she was just surprised to see you there and probably felt a bit vulnerable - I'd guess she's really appreciative that you could be there for her son.  If not, she should be. \n\nediting to say that NAH is probably more appropriate assuming she comes to appreciate that you came for her son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
