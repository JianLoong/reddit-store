Even if the car is fully repaired, it still keeps the salvage title (though it becomes what my state calls salvage rebuilt title). This affects resale value, ability to get insurance, etc.", "Well obviously. They ask you to report it to the police. If you don't report it, they won't take your claim to fix your car. I don't get what's hard to understand about that, lol", "That's more complicated than that.\n\nhttps://legalbeagle.com/6499776-laws-regarding-driving-private-property.html", "It's against the law in most places in the US as well.", "It's against the law here too, but people still do it. While all the passengers fled after the crash, the driver was busted by the police. So either way, he's on the hook for this.", "If I'm not mistaken, In most states in the US its against the law to let your insurance lapse and you absolutely cannot buy a car without it...So its likely that the kid either stole/borrowed the car or someone has a suspended license...if there is no insurance, I mean.", "Insurance can\u2019t total the car if he doesn\u2019t file a claim.", "1. You don't have to report it to the police if both parties agree who's at fault.\n\n2. a police report literally would just determine who's at fault, no one is charged with a crime for side-swiping a car?? \n3. There is a difference between filling out a police repirt and pressing charges. Insurance just doesn't care about the second, as it doesn't change theirnpayout", "Yes. But the person I was replying to said that *if the insurance totaled the car*, they had the option of applying that money to repair, and I was dating what would happen in that case.", "Would the brother admit he is at fault though?\n\nHe literally told the OP to lie.", "1. 99% of reputable insurance companies require a police report before going forward with anything. They don't care for verbal agreements of who's at fault. If no one files the report, they don't have to pay out. \n\n2. I would agree if he side swiped the car. But he was recklessly driving and drifting, causing a crash. The police may have something to say if that's what was reported, and I can see why the parents would prefer to keep it off the record. Where I live, if he just got his licence (within 2/3 years), they will just straight-up revoke it and ban you for 5 years from driving.", "That's what the police report is for. When both parties claim not to be at fault, the cops fill out their report. The insurance investigators determines who's at fault.", "1. I've done it with Geico and State Farm.\n\n2. He was drifting on private property, also no witnesses. Cops have better things to do. He might lose his license, being 16, states are touchy, but again that should be the kids choice. Loads of people live fine without one"]}
