I (f43) am super supportive and in the beginning offered advice as I minored in business. I started to feel too invested in the company and said I couldn't be involved with the marketing and social media as I have a full-time job (he does as well). I also know that he has made it clear it is not my company and I am not part of it. His partners wife has no interest in the company or any involvement. They were approached about doing a farmers market and he asked me what I thought, I said do it. I am avalible to help on days where he or his partner are out of town.\nOn the first farmers market he asked me to come learn with his one employee. She sat in a chair the whole time and I hustled to learn about the product and what the script is. When leaving he thanked her profusely and got in his car (we traveled separately). When we got home I said that it was not cool to be your wife who hustled all day and be ignored. He said it didn't even cross his mind to thank me as we still needed to unload at home. I asked him to talk to his partner and establish clear expectations for my role with the company. He said I don't have a roll with the company, I am not an employee nor am I really a volunteer cause I am his wife. Keeping in mind he is investing our money into the company and his partner is not. He finally agreed to talk to his partner about it. Weeks later after a few more markets and him starting to want to have conversations about buisness moves I brought up boundaries again. He said I was making no sense. I am his wife and I volunteered to run the market. How can we not talk about it as our lives overlap. I explained there is a reason that when couples separate and there is a business they may divide the company and with my involvement I would be intitled to that. He took this as a threat. I said from now on I will not talk with him the company outside of the market as the emotional and mental labor are not for something that is mine. He took that to mean I will no longer work the market. He got very angry and is saying he is just going to quit the business because this is ridiculous and he doesn't want to deal with it.

If this is how hubs thinks business works I\u2019d pull all my support, financial and otherwise. Then I\u2019d take him up on his offer to shut it down, so he can fill his free time going to couples therapy with you to re-evaluate things.", "NTA and tbh, him saying he will quit the business because you won't be involved for free makes him sound like a baby.", "NTA. Your husband seems confused. Or kinda dumb. Or both.", "NTA. \n\nThe answer to this is \u2018yes, quitting would probably be a good ideas as long as you get OUR money back. In future please don\u2019t start a business with OUR money and treat me like a slave, thanks\u2019.", "NTA you are paying to work for his business and you can bet that if you two separate you'll get nothing out of your financial or work investment. I'd take a good look at the business paperwork and keep a record of financial investment just in case things go south.", "My husband runs a small company with a friend, we have very clear boundaries about what I will and won\u2019t do, but any big decisions are always run by me because while I\u2019m not working within the company other than helping out every now and then, this is our money, our future, and time away from our family when he\u2019s working on it. Also, when he sold the last little company, myself and the partners wife were entitled to our share (I realise laws are probably different here) but I was ok with it going into the new venture. He\u2019s treating you like free labour, and even worse, free labour he\u2019s entitled to. Nta. Not at all.", "NTA.  How is this business formed? I'm a tax accountant. Where is the business agreement? Since he is using the collective \"our\" money and the partner isn't investing, what happens if hubs just walks away?", "stop giving him advice, stop working for him for free, and tell him if he\u2019s going to quit the business he better get your money back. what is this man. who. how. nta.", "Honestly, you should have discussed this BEFORE the business started if the money being invested belongs to the both of you. How do you have no say when your money is being used? \n\nNTA. \n\nBut you should be wary of future joint investments with him if he's going to treat you like this. \n\nAnd agree to him quitting as long as you get your money back ( or a substantial part of it). The less stress the better for both of you. And that business is causing you stress.", "YTA for the wall of text.  They teach punctuation and indentation at your school?", "I am confused.  Are you asking jd it is ok to say you won't talk about the business at all outside the market or something else", "YTA I don't understand your motives. You're married, you already own 50% of his stake in this business. This is partially your business. It doesn't obligate you to participate, but you do have ownership in it. \n\nYou already said you couldn't do X, you agreed to do Y. An understanding of boundaries seems to already be established but you didn't get thanked enough for doing what you said you'd do so you brought up divorce. It's all very bizarre, I agree with your husband, this is too stressful to possibly be worth it for a side hustle.", "YTA. You said you didn't want to be involved, volunteered your help, and then got mad at how involved you were.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just because you're his partner doesn't mean he gets to make you work for free or invalidate your involvement in his business.", "NTA Pending more info: \nWhat type of contract and business setup did they put in writing when they started this business?\n\nIf he is using YOUR/OUR money then you in fact do get a say in the business. You get to \"help\" run it by knowing where YOUR/OUR money is going and when you are getting your/our money back into your/our account and then you get to make some very clear boundaries and where he uses HIS funds in the future.\n\nDoes he do this often? Start a business with OUR money and then not allow US to have opinions? \n\nWhat happens if his friend wants out? Does get to take any of YOUR money with him? Your husband could buy you out and then really you would never have to talk about it again.", "nta", "He's not even treating her as someone who does free labour, he's acting like a magic fairy gets all this stuff done and OP has nothing to do with it", "Oh yes!!! This!!!", "This!! \nShe shouldn't beg him to stay.", "NTA.  Also, legally, you are equal owners of whatever is his share because you're married. At least in the USA that's just facts. Common property.", "NTA.  Your husband is being a dick though.", "Info: what are your class boundaries? \n\nYou're not clear on what you expect. How many markets per week are you willing to help on? How many does he expect? How many hours per week will you work on a business that you have no say over, that will decide your financial future?\n\nYou're not wrong to be concerned", "NTA not sure how to put this into words,  but your husband is treating you like an extra arm.", "NAH, sounds more like a communication problem that you both could have handled better. In general it sounds like you and your husband have invested more in the business than the other couple, so could you renegotiate with the business partner to own a greater share of the business? That way it's not a fight over what belongs to you vs your husband (since all your assets are jointly owned) but rather a discussion about what's fair for the two of you as a couple to contribute vs the business partner and his wife.", "Free labor AND free money. OP wrote that he is investing THEIR money in the business. Yet it's somehow HIS business only? Sounds like she's being taken for a ride.", "Dude I know it is kinda cliche here to be jumping divorce but this is where I would divorce. Fucking gross. He is materialistic,he wants to benefit every way possible while crushing her completely. Love won't do fr. Money is more important than a disrespectful jerk doesn't have mutual feelings.", "Well, treating someone this way isn't loving, but it sure is manipulative. \n\nIf you can't hear your partner out and can't respect them or their boundaries, especially when those boundaries should be innate, you don't really love them. You love the idea of getting something from them (fewer chores, money, free labour, a social status boost of some sort, etc).", "Absolutely NTA..\nHe's being unreasonable just coz you are his wife. Without even appreciating you? Nuh-uh. No babe.", "If it were me - He would  be running the market on his own, plus he using your money and you have no say! I think his expectations are flawed. Your NTA, but I would separate my money from his business attempts. NTA", "NTA \nHe wants to quit as soon as you said you wouldn't do a chunk of the work for him.", "NTA but your husband is.\n\n1. Your joint money is invested in this. That makes you a partner in the business so he has no right to tell you you are not part of it. If that is how he wants it then pull your money from it.\n\n2. You should pull back from the market and let him get someone else in. Right now you are working for free. Just because you\u2019re married to him doesn\u2019t give him the right to treat you as an unpayed intern. He does not value you.", "NTA, get rid of the \"business moocher\" for good. He doesn't contribute money, so he has less ownership stake than you. Half is your husband's, half is yours.", "WTF  NTA\n\nYour husband has invested your joint money into a 'business' with somebody who has invested no money? You have no say or input into this 'business' but now he wants you to invest your time and labour but calls you a 'not even volunteer'?  This isn't a business - its a money pit organised by 2 men who think they know what they are doing but expect something for nothing.\n\nVolunteer your time away now and spend your weekends on your personal projects.  Do you have separate accounts?  what else has he sunk  your hard earned money into??\n\nHis judgement is poor", "He expects all that AND she gets no pay or even a thank you.", "Exactly\n\n\nShe's not and employee or even really a volunteer because she's his wife! A perfect task fairy to just do thing and he doesn't have to think about it or be grateful at all!"]}
