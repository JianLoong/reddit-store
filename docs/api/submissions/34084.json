Their parents are doing OK financially though not comfortable. I am much better off money wise.\n\nI\u2019m one of those people who don\u2019t know what to give people during Christmas and don\u2019t have enough energy to figure out or guess. For years I gave friends and family gift cards to places I know they frequent like favorite coffee shops or bookstores. For nieces and nephews, I gave cash. I always thought their parents let them buy things they wanted but my bio nieces and nephews recently complained to me how their parents took my cash gifts and put the amount in each kid\u2019s saving account. They said they wanted to be able to buy stuff like their oldest sister. My step niece also received cash gift from me but her mom let her spend the money.\n\nSo for this year I gave each a box of chocolate at the Christmas gathering and told them I would also take them to the mall as part of my Christmas presents. I took all five out yesterday and gave them $50 each with the oldest getting $70 and told them to buy what they like. I asked the oldest to take the youngest to look around while I asked the middle three where in the mall they would like to go and took them. At the end of the day everyone got candies and toys and books and clothes. I fed everyone at the food court and dropped them off at my parents because their parents were meeting some friends.\n\nLater that night my sister called to yell at me. She said it was completely inappropriate of me to let her kids spend money freely like that. She said she put the money in the bank for them to teach them to be frugal while I just encouraged them to spend outside of their means. She said once her kids reach their teens like her stepdaughter she would allow them to use the money, too, but right now they\u2019re too young and I am spoiling them.\n\nI think spending money on what you like is part of the Christmas experience. It\u2019s just sad to have to be frugal even during the holidays.

She\u2019s teaching them to be miserable.", "NTA. I could maybe understand the parents wanting to save some of that money for their kids, but taking the entire cash gift to put in their savings accounts is ridiculous. Sounds like you had a great day with them that they'll remember for a long time and be able to enjoy their gifts from. Maybe next time you could plan a fun outing with them where it's more just the experience that's the gift? That could be a good compromise.", "NTA\n\nThis is no different than you taking that 50 dollars and buying something with it to give to them. You just took them in person to buy their gifts.", "What?\nIt\u2019s your money and if you want to buy an astronaut suit because your niece wants one it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s $50. It\u2019s not like you gave them a thousand dollars. Spending well outside their means is an extreme exaggeration. I personally would have loved to have a mall trip like that as a kid. You know those kids will use what they bought and gave them a nice day out with you. I think you did an awesome job!", "NTA. Every other year has been like them getting nothing because mom takes their money. This year they had the joy of picking what they wanted. Good job Auntie. I would do this every year", "Freely spend money? It was fifty dollars. Maybe you could have accompanied the younger ones and talked about their purchases. But my dad was a bit like you. He would hand each of us a credit card and let us go. He would only get involved to sign the charge (he would post up by the register). NTA.", "NTA - your gift to them wasn't money this year, it was a day trip with their aunt. You are free to gift them what you think they'd like.

To skip the complaints take them out before Christmas next year let them know you these are going to be your gifts just take them to your place in the bags that they bought them in.

I grew up with parents who wouldn\u2019t let me spend my gift money or the money I earned at work (if I spent it I got yelled at and sometimes grounded), you\u2019re doing the right thing. They get time with you and get to pick out what they want.", "Nta", "NTA. I had an aunt-like family friend who did this with me every year, and it\u2019s such a sweet tradition. We\u2019d go to one of the bigger malls, have lunch, look around at the stores that were different from my usual mall, and I\u2019d get a stuffed animal or something.

Been there \u2014seen that .The children will likely grow up to use shopping as a reward because it\u2019s being so restricted with harshness now .Saving money is good \u2014-but not a Christmas gift !!!", "I can verify this as my mom was like that. They sold their car in the 70s for $60 and wouldn't let me buy it as **I needed that money for college.** I still can't forget the tightness she held over my money.
