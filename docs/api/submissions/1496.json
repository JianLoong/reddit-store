WITH HER FRIENDS. i send her a text straight up, telling her that i saw her snapchat story, and not only am i mad (her doing this cuts into my studying/homework time and i\u2019m in school to get my bachelors in chemistry, so my study time is important to me) but that i won\u2019t be helping her out anymore. i told her that she shouldn\u2019t even bother asking me to take her shifts, because my answer would be no. i showed the video to my manager, and he thanked me for showing him.

You weren't really rude so don't beat yourself up about that. You were honest and direct instead of beating around the bush so now she knows exactly where she stands.

Your coworker is flaking off, and your manager is the one who gets paid a lot of money to deal with it. Since you're just a low level low pay worker, you should do what's best for you.
