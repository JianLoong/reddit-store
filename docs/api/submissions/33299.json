We stay at their house for a few days. Everyone opens gifts together. It\u2019s hectic but a lot of fun. The kids enjoy having one big sleepover with their cousins, my mom likes having everyone home again. We all pitch in. It\u2019s a win win.\n\nLast year, my brother married \u201cSally\u201d. She has a 7 year old daughter, \u201cMindy\u201d. This was their first Christmas with us. It seemed like they were having a fun time. Christmas Eve, all the kids went to the finished basement to sleep. We told the kids to not open up gifts without us and to wake us up when they did. This was repeated several times. Once the kids were asleep, we put all the gifts under the tree and eventually went to bed ourselves.\n\nThe next morning, around 6 AM, I wake up early and head downstairs. I find the living room a mess. Half of the gifts were unwrapped. Several of them had been ripped from their boxes. There was Mindy, playing with some of the toys. Most of the ones weren\u2019t even hers. She knows how to read and they were all labeled, so she knew this. I was in shock. I went and got my brother, Sally alongside the rest of the adults. Sally was super embarrassed. My mom was very upset. \n\nThe other kids weren\u2019t up yet, so we tried to salvage what we could while Sally talked to Mindy. Not everything could be fixed and she had broken a couple of toys completely. The broken ones weren\u2019t even her own toys. Luckily, not everything was damaged and even the boxes that were, the kids didn\u2019t notice. But my nephew (sister\u2019s son) had one of his big gifts destroyed and he was sad when everyone else got theirs while he was told he\u2019d have to wait for a new one to come back in. Sally and my brother reimbursed everyone. Mindy didn\u2019t get to open gifts with everyone but joined the festivities later. She apologized, but kept making excuses. She said she didn\u2019t want to wait and she wanted to see what everyone else got. \n\nWe\u2019re all preparing to go to my parents\u2019 again this year. I put in the group chat that we should either lock the door to the living room this year or put a gate around the tree so no one can get to it. I didn\u2019t even name names, just specifically said \u201cno one\u201d. Sally and my brother got mad, accusing me of treating Mindy like a baby or an animal. I said I\u2019m not, but this is a precaution so none of the kids are tempted. They said this isn\u2019t necessary and I\u2019m holding a mistake over Mindy\u2019s head. I said no, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m trying to make sure we have NO repeat.\n\nBecause I know it\u2019ll be asked: Mindy doesn\u2019t have autism or ADHD and even if she did,  my daughter has ADHD and both my sister\u2019s kids are on the spectrum. They knew better. I don\u2019t think Mindy was malicious. She was only 6. But I do think precautions should be made. My parents agree with me and my brother is mad that I put it in their heads.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702927363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lh219/aita_for_suggesting_we_lock_up_the_christmas/", "score": 9998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't understand why your bro and sil are upset. You aren't asking them to lock Mindy in a room or put an ankle bracelet on her or even that they have a talk with her before Christmas to remind her not to open presents. You're not advocating for her to marched through the house while you ring a bell and scream \"shame\" at her. You're suggesting that the door to the living room gets locked overnight. Nothing needs to be said to the kids because if they stay in bed, they won't even know.", "I mean, why *wouldn't* you do this? It kind of isn't even just about Mindy - although of course it's about Mindy, she ruined Christmas and broke a lot of other people's toys - but you have a bunch of small children who are notoriously bad with impulse control. Why *not* lock the door or put a gate around the tree? Any child could be tempted by sleeping parents and gorgeously wrapped presents under a lit tree. She's still only 7!\n\nAlso, if your kid acts like a baby they should be treated like one. Come on, Sally, the girl opened half the Christmas presents and you and your husband had to shell out to replace them. Wouldn't you rather lock the room than risk having to put out and feel embarrassed all over again?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Hasn't your brother ever heard \"Once bitten, twice shy\"? It's bad enough to have one Christmas ruined. Taking precautions is far better then having them say \"It'll never happen again\" and then having it ruined again. It's just not worth the risk when a simple precaution can eliminate the risk.\n\nYou may be showing some mistrust, but it's *earned* mistrust.", "NTA\u2026Mindy didn\u2019t just open the gifts, she destroyed some of them\u2026that is absolutely not normal for a 6yo. Locking the living room door is the sensible thing to do and shouldn\u2019t offend anyone.", "NTA. One ruined Christmas is plenty, and what you're suggesting isn't extreme. No temptation, no ruined gifts, no embarrassment, no wasted money.", "Nta. I'm laughing reading the contrarian weirdos in these comments, which is even funnier given that I'm occasionally a contrarian weirdo.\n\nYour neice ruined Christmas. There's no getting around it. My parents(and grandparents) raised our families similarly, and opening presents is a big part of the celebration, because parents want to see the joy in their children's faces. Mindy knew what she was doing was wrong, and chose to do it anyway. She was 6, not two. She absolutely might do it again. Even if not, there's no reason not to take some kind of simple precaution. If the doors to the room with the tree can be locked, do it. Other similar precautions are perfectly reasonable. At worst, maybe get a motion sensor web cam and set up some kind of alert so that any motion in that room over night wakes up the adults.\n\nMindy's parents have absolutely no right to be upset. I'm shocked they aren't the ones suggesting it, but that's the difference between good parents and bad parents. Good parents teach discipline, and know how to punish appropriately. They also know how to be realistic about their children and take precautions when putting their kids in situations that are known to tempt their willpower.", "NTA. \n\nIt's unfortunate you even have to lock the door but your brother and step-sister need to discipline their daughter better. It's not just the fact she opened them early it's that she broke other peoples gifts.", "NTA.  It's only fair after what happened last year that you at least suggest taking precautions.  I would recommending locking up your kid's gifts and/or getting up extremely early in case Mindy gets up early to try her tasmanian devil routine again.", "My daughter was 4 last Christmas. You want to know how many presents she opened without anyone around or broke anything? Not one. \n\nNTA. \n\nOnce bitten, twice shy as others have said.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother and sally are still embarrassed and just want everyone to forget what Mindy did. This is an untimely reminder of that but ultimately makes complete sense in the circumstances.", "NTA.  The door can be unlocked before any of the children get up in the morning.   If all of the children are still asleep when the adults get up, then it's no harm, no foul, and no destroyed gifts.", "NTA \n\nHow else will kids learn? Showing explicitly that the gifts are off limits will make sure that no one has an ideas. Locking the living room for would be my vote.", "I realize this may be awkward and embarrassing for your brother and Sally but Mindy's behavior ruined last Christmas.  It makes me wonder if she had just never had such a holiday experience before and was overwhelmed by it all. I agree that her actions weren't malicious, but they were still so wildly inappropriate that it's reasonable to make extra precautions. This may also prevent other kids from playing any pranks on Mindy this year as payback. The adults may be afraid to talk about it, but the other kids aren't going to be, at least when left to their own devices. It makes sense to reset the way holiday gifts are handled from now on for everybody's sake. NTA", "NTA. Your taking a reasonable precaution because of something that happened the year before. You don\u2019t want to risk the other kids being let down again because of something that could have been prevented.", "NTA, as long as the living room door can be locked without creating a fire hazard (i.e. kids can get from the basement to the front door without passing through the living room), locking the living room overnight is a great option. \n\nIt would be one thing to deliberately rub it in everyone\u2019s faces that you\u2019re making the change specifically to stop Mindy being a little brat, it\u2019s another to do it quietly to make sure Christmas isn\u2019t ruined for the other kids. Sure Mindy opening everyone\u2019s presents early again like a little grinch sounds egregious and unlikely, but it was egregious last year too and she still did it. These are the consequences and they\u2019re not that bad.", "NTA. If your brother and Sally are *so sure* Mindy will follow the rules this year then she will never know the door to the living room is locked. \n\n\nLock the door. Say nothing to any of the kids. If they all do as they\u2019re told none of them will know anything was done differently. If they try to pull a Mindy this year then that potential crisis is averted.", "NTA...my granddaughter was 3 last Christmas. We had presents under the tree. She woke up first. You know what she did...woke everyone else up. Then waited for her presents. \n\nWe do stockings before breakfast and presents after. My grandson is 14. He never did this. My children never did this. This child has impulse control issues or is just spoiled rotten. She absolutely knew these presents were not hers...AND she broke them? \n\nYou absolutely need to take precautions. And absolutely need to tell your brother and his girlfriend to back the fuck up. Their daughter RUINED Christmas for other peoples' CHILDREN. CHILDREN!!!!!! They can get as butthurt as they want but you aren't taking chances that another person's child will be disappointed with broken, unwrapped toys on Christmas morning. \n\nThe audacity of them to be annoyed by common sense.", "NTA. The child is more than old enough to know she should not have done that and that she was doing something really wrong that deserved punishment. And she didn't get any punishment, joined in all the festivities, and now, when she gets the chance to do it all again, her parents are angry that y'all don't trust her.", "NTA. But I'd keep presents locked in the trunk of your car to remove the temptation.", "NTA\n\nIt was my oldest child's birthday yesterday. My youngest saw the gifts and immediately went over to open one. I held my youngest and explained to them who they were for and why, and then when it was *their* turn to have a birthday part, there would be plenty of gifts just for them. \n\nThose gifts were untouched for the entire duration of the party. \n\nMy youngest is 4. It's possible to teach self-control. \n\nAnd no, Mindy didn't want to see what everyone else got. She played with it. She WANTED what everyone else got.", "NTA. If they won\u2019t agree to lock the door, I would keep the presents you are giving others in the room where you are sleeping, and don\u2019t put them out until the next morning when you are awake and can supervise.  Your sister and parents can choose to do the same.  If any presents get destroyed, it will only be those your brother and SIL were planning to give.", "NTA.  A six year old should have been mature enough to know that not all of those gifts were hers and if your brother and his wife want to get offended and think that their girl is being singled out by your suggestion to lock the doors its because she IS since she was unable to keep her hands to herself.", "NTA not at all. Of course this should be prevented from happening again. Your brother and Sally are ridiculous for not understanding", "NTA.\n\nThe other children deserve not to have their Xmas ruined.\n\nLocking a door is simple, effective, and won\u2019t cause any harm.", "NTA. Why risk the brat messing up another holiday? Maybe if there's a lock on things and little Mindy and her mom know she's the reason, Mindy will be better behaved and her mother will parent a bit better. That kid blatantly disrespected everyone in the house and literally said it's because she couldn't wait. There is no excuse. She knew what she was doing was wrong but did it anyway.", "NTA, gotta do what you gotta do to avoid that from happening again", "Nta one Christmas that was screwed up is quite enough.   You didn't signle her out or name names.", "NTA, what kind of kid doesn\u2019t know not to do that at SIX?", "Keep your kids' presents in the trunk of your car until the morning", "You're NTA, because I definitely get it since she didn't just open gifts but also broke several that weren't hers which also made the day less fun for other kids.\n\nThis is why I'm kinda happy we have a different way of doing Christmas here. Santa visits us during the day and hands out gifts directly to the kids.", "NTA\n\nIf Mindy was not malicious and just being a 6 year old (which is semi-reasonable, but not totally, my 4 year old knows better) then that is all the more reason for locking things.\n\nIf a kid does not yet have a skill, such as impulse control, as parents its our job to put systems in place to compensate for them to mitigate risks.", "INFO\n\nIf you truly believe Mindy wouldn't do this again, are there other kids likely to be tempted?

Gotta explain.\n\nFirstly, there is no guarantee that she wouldn't do it again, because some kids have impulse control, at any age. Maturity means controlling it, and I know some technical adults who have trouble with it.  It's a temptation.\n\nSecondly, the other kids might think it's their turn, this year.  She wasn't horribly punished, in their presence and still got her gifts. What do they really have to lose?  It was the kid with the broken big gift who really suffered.\n\nAnd thirdly ... most importantly ... If you don't want something to happen, you prevent it in the first place.\n\nI get that it's not a great look for the child, and whether or not it singles her out for being \"bad\". I get the emotional reprocussions for her, and it leaves her open to teasing by the other kids. Her Mom is pretty embarrassed and this just exacerbates that embarrassment.  Like she's a lousy Mom who wouldn't make the incident a teachable moment. Or that her child is a \"bad\" kid.\n\nBut I'm also a big fan of prevention, as much as possible.

He was the youngest there, so nobody had a ruined day. It was just some cheap chocolate Santas. He's 20s now, and 'remember the time you beheaded chocolate Santas and went back to bed' is a great funny story to share with his girlfriend.\n\nThe only 'presents' I reserve from under the tree are for cats and dogs because they will likely smell presents and try to get them. The humans we generally trust. Except for 3 year olds with chocolate Santas.\n\nThough, that does make me wonder about any sleepovers in the future... I do like having presents wrapped up under the tree in advance. I wait until my ADHD hyperfocus/ too much trait strikes and spend way too long making presents look *phenomenal* and wrap all the presents at my mom's house and she feeds me her presents to wrap and they look awesome and the trees are so festive. Lots of presents. Is it three weeks before Christmas or three days? No idea! But it happens! Eventually! Has not happened yet, this year. Hate to see my ADHD too much presents ruined early by littles before they're supposed to be ripped apart.\n\nHave more littles around, now. Chocolate Santas unwrapped? *Hilarious.* Presents... not so much. Maybe if the little ones stay the night with great grandma and great grandpa, we can alarm the doors with dog potty bells, lol.", "I think they are also in denial that Mindy might need some help, mental health wise. 6 or 7 is too old to do that, especially at a home where you don\u2019t know everyone very well.

After we explained how it works she didn't touch any since then.", "Way better.", "My kid is six and and only child. I definitely remember him *asking* to open *my* presents last year.

That\u2019s how kids work. Nothing on OP or anyone else\u2019s kids that would do it, but yeah lock the door. Where on earth did she get the idea that this was okay?  Ugh.", "I disagree. My kids know they shouldn't open presents that aren't theirs much younger than 6. I think that's a pretty low teaching bar to set.

I can only guarantee that they *know* if something is egregiously wrong, such as this.", "By 6 a kid should know better.", "6years old understand what presents are and to not open ones that don't belong to them", "Well OP would have to discuss it with their parents. And if they excluded Sally from that conversation then she's probably get mad about them talking about her behind her back.\n\nThey're adults. \"Hey, we need to lock that door this year\" is a reasonable thing to be able to say. \n\nSally should have suggested it herself.", "Because it's not OP's house it's their parents' house and they would need to run it by them at the very least.", "This is a good point. OP would have been better off talking to mom/grandma directly instead of in the group chat.

I also think putting all the kids in the basement might not be a good idea this year.  You may find someone tied Mindy up in the morning.", "Maybe an adult should sleep on the living room sofa. Or draw straws to see who takes the first shift staying awake.", "Right?  I think this might actually be a bigger problem than Mindy getting to them.", "I would have too!  At that age I'd have held a grudge for awhile!", "That was my thought.", "That was my thinking. If I was the parents I would suggest Sally take Mindy to HER parents this year.", "Agreed! Why not have them over after presents, since this kid has a bad habit of doing this?", "For Me they'd get invited, but on Christmas morning. There wouldn't be a sleepover for them.\n\nLet her parents pack her presents in the car to be opened with everyone else, what fun that'll be! But they can arrive at like 10am Christmas morning or something, and the other kids can be told they need to have breakfast first or wash up before doing presents. \n\nThat way Mindy doesn't miss any of the group opening, she doesn't have a chance to be in the same position again. Is it unfair she doesn't get to sleepover, sure, but it was also unfair to all the other kids last year. \n\nEase her into it. If she plays will(literally) with others this year, she can earn a sleepover the next year. \n\nThe last thing they can do is, yes, lock the door. But the best thing is to have the adults on shifts, watches for an hour or two each in the sitting room, waiting for kids to appear, then sending them back off to bed til an appropriate time. Parents keep the presents in their rooms(or the car, or a shed/garage) until like 3am, out of reach from all kids, not on display before they go to bed. \n\nAnd aside from all that. The adults need to get together here and have a sit down. Putting this all over messages and group chats isn't gonna help. They need to work it out and come to an agreement, not leave it ambiguous and hanging, questions for the day, they need to finish the conversation with everyone on board. A 1 hour coffee at the mom's house, or sit down somewhere is gonna be worth a week of messages back and forth.", "Roy Moore has entered the chat.", "And not even 'I'm sorry, how can I repair the situation?' \n\nbut\n\n'I'm sorry, but it's not really my fault.'", "Dunno about you, but I wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit down for a week, if I\u2019d done something like this.", "And according to Reddit, a lot of them, don\u2019t even have to do that\u2026 The parents just say, \u201coh he\u2019s just a kid\u201c. \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c", "Exactly.

When I was that age I would be trying to make friends with my new cousins, not doing something to embarass myself or make them not like me.\n\nI don't think we should jump to crisis just yet, but maybe she needs some therapy because OPs brother is not her father and she may not be taking the wedding and new family thing well.

Some parents spoil only children. I am an only child, but I wasn't spoiled.", "My only child son is on his absolute best behavior around his cousins. He doesn't have siblings so he is always wanting them to like him and enjoy their time with him around.

Christmas is sacred to kids, even super young ones. I'm always shocked how early they *get* it. There's something wrong with that kid, or more likely, her parents.", "I agree 100%.

Now, this was just with our own kids, but yea, my husband can't wait to give presents. I'm surprised he survived waiting until Christmas.\n\nThe first Christmas I was with him, he went shopping late at night (I worked days, he worked nights), came home, wrapped everything up, hid the gifts and all the evidence (wrapping paper/tape). Then woke me up at my normal time and brought it all out again! I tried to make him wait, but I had to open it all right then. It's kind of funny. He's gotten slightly better over the last 25 years.

There was always something to eat (chocolate/dried fruit etc) something to play with on your own (puzzle/book etc.) Something to play with others (game/figures etc.)\n\nBut the \"real\" presents were under the tree downstairs, and there we were not allowed to go.\n\nI'd suggest a compromise of similar stockings for all the kids, and either a lock on the door to where the tree is, or a hotel alarm thing that hangs off the door handle and keys out a screech if they open it.", "Honestly, even if it was because of Mindy you\u2019re NTA. Your brother and SIL think consequences and punishment are the same thing. They arent. The natural consequences of Mindy being incredibly inconsiderate is that you take precautions until she can show otherwise. Mindy is still participating and getting gift- why should you risk another child\u2019s Christmas being ruined?", "I mean, if some of them thought it was funny at the time, then one or more of them might do it again because they think it's funny", "I\u2019m almost 100% sure my almost 6 year old wouldn\u2019t do this, but I\u2019ve been keeping presents locked in the trunk of my car for the last few months so the surprise isn\u2019t ruined. It removes any temptation to root through the house for the stash. My parents kept our presents out of the house until we were asleep and we had the rule that we let them sleep, but we were allowed into our stockings until like 7am.

She knew better.", "*Once bitten, twice shy*  \n*Cousins all sleeping, but she had a surprise*  \n*Tell me Mindy, did you see your name there?*  \n*No, but I wanted it, so why should I care?*  \n\n*Happy Christmas, we wrapped it up for the kids*  \n*Pretty paper pretty ribbon, now shredded to bits*  \n*Now we know what fools we had all been*  \n*But she's coming back this year, she thinks she'll fool us again*", "omg I literally cannot read this comment but sing", "All the unwrapped presents!  \nAll the unwrapped presents!", "Same. My cousins would of been brutal not violent but they would tease whoever did it. \"Your spoiled ass is gonna ruin it again for the rest of us?\", \"remember how you ruined Christmas last year?\" Etc etc most of us sweared at each other by the time we were in 2nd grade so that why I said what I did the first quote.", ">They should be. But they're insulted because \"MY child would NEVER do this (again)!\"\n\n\nSo, did they believe this last year too?  how'd that go? OR, did they know their kid would do it, and if so, why was nothing done to prevent it?", ">your brother and step-sister ought to be more strict with their daughter\n\nThe fact that they seem so offended over this, has me thinking they didn't (and don't) punish Mindy when she does things like this. So 100% it happens again if they don't lock it all up.", "Yeah. There's multiple ways this could go..\n\n1. Mindy doing it again.\n2. Another child doing it so that Mindy can't do it first.\n3. Another child breaking Mindy's presents in revenge.\n4. Another child does it because, if Mindy can, why can't they?  \n5. Miraculously, every child chooses to be a little angel. (This is a very rare and special option. This is what we consider to be a Christmas miracle.) \n\nI don't want to accuse the other children in OP's life or make assumptions about them based on something that Mindy did. They seem like good kids, so, I hope they wouldn't get this thought. But even the best children can make mistakes when pushed to a limit, and messing with Christmas is definitely a limit for some children.", "This is what I was thinking. One of the other kids could decide to beay Molly to the presents this year and open stuff while others are asleep. Or all the kids could sneak in and have a present organized opening everything.", "Didn't she say the kids didn't know what happened.. they tried to salvage everything and only told one kid he would have to wait. I don't think they told them why..", "I mean that is an option too. Lock Mindy in her parents room. Let her go to sleep with the rest of the kids then transfer her later if you don't want to \"single\" her out in front of everyone", "Nothing so extreme, an anklet to the bedpost should suffice...\n\n/s", "Definitely *and* defiantly", "The motion detector should be connected to an alarm loud enough to wake the entire neighborhood.", "Same but my family did that to keep the Santa illusion real. There would be no presents and then at like 4am they would place all the gifts under the tree so then the next morning it was as if Santa put them there. (Well for me my family never said it was Santa since I'm Mexican it was always baby Jesus who did it \"el ni\u00f1o jesus\".", "Ding ding ding!  Here's the answer.\n\nDoesn't sound like anyone is concerned about Santa, so don't put out any gifts until everyone is awake and it's time to open them together.", "Oh her actions are her fault. Destroying other people\u2019s things is a choice she made.", "This is a wild take. The parents took the incident seriously - they were embarrassed, appropriately apologized, reimbursed for all of the broken gifts, spoke to Mindy, and gave her consequences because she had to sit out of the rest of the morning Christmas activities and was not allowed to join the group until later. These people are family. After all of that, it would be AH behavior not to invite them to Christmas when they handled it appropriately.", "Exactly! Don't let Mindy ruin Christmas for the other kids two years in a row. They don't have a choice where they spend Christmas. Make sure they have a good one by taking precautions.", "First thing popped in my head.", "No shit. Everyone gets a chance\u2014 but you fuck up THAT big? Then act an ass when someone suggests a reasonable step to prevent the same? Nah man get fucked, and find someplace else to be.", "And they won't be if she does it again. 6 was more than old enough to know better than this, impulse control was the issue. I don't understand why the brother/sil want to set their kid up for failure, especially on Christmas.", "I know!  I'm a child of the 80s too and I'm thinking about how our parents would have treated us if we pulled a bratty stunt like this.  Even people here on this sub are like, \"aw, she's *only* 7\", like WTF?? 7 years old is the first grade.  That's not out-of-control toddler age.  I'm not saying we would've have been physically beaten (although a light paddling wouldn't have been totally out of the realm), but we definitely would have had all of our presents taken away and not been allowed to participate in anything for the rest of the day.  I remember our punishments and they never involved physical violence, but they were also stern enought that whatever you had done, you were guaranteed never to pull that shit again. \n\nMaybe I'm cynical, but why were so many of the toys *broken?*  I mean, if she was just unwrapping things, why would they be broken beyond repair if she truly wasn't being malicious?  My guess?  She unwrapped her stuff and those were fine.  But when she unwrapped nice gifts for other kids that she knew weren't hers and that she wouldn't get to keep, she destroyed them out of anger.  There's no way this was innocent.  Based on her behavior and their reaction, I think brother and sister-in-law are well on their way to spoiled-brat town.", "We were all kids at one time, excited about Christmas. But none of us pulled this stunt. They were guests in someone else\u2019s home and destroyed things? My parents would have apologized, paid for the damage, taken ALL my presents away and taken my sorry butt home. And it would have been THEIR idea the next year to lock everything up.", "I don\u2019t think parents need to be harsh like back then. But a few well placed spanks would drive the lesson home in a situation like this. Intentionally disobeying on something like this shouldn\u2019t be tolerated. What if one of the adults had gotten another adult some liquor or a firearm or anything that could be dangerous. \n\nMy wife and I didn\u2019t have kids unfortunately. Our niece was with us all the time. Everyone told me she was a hellion who never listened. I knew her mom didn\u2019t tolerate that but no one else would give her boundaries. First time she stayed she was ten. I told her what was expected nothing major and I told her that if she didn\u2019t listen I had a corner with her name on it. She got a little snotty thinking I would back down when she said she wouldn\u2019t stand in any corner. \n\nI looked her in the face and said if you don\u2019t want to stand there then I will spank you then you can stand there. Once she found out her mom was on board with that I never had one bit of trouble ever. I gave her the expectations nothing she wasn\u2019t capable of sticking too, I told her what would happen and told her that it would happen if it did it was her choice. Be firm, fair and consistent. You don\u2019t need to be harsh but a couple smacks on the butt can sure get the desired result. If you yell scream and threaten you have already lost. When she was about 17 she came in one day and sat down on my lap and hugged me. She said would you have really spanked me if I didn\u2019t follow your rules. I said I love you. However if you broke the rules I would have spanked you. It wouldn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love you, it would mean I love you enough to keep my word and to keep you from doing something you would regret or could get hurt doing. \n\nHer and I are still close. Kids don\u2019t need friends. They need parents or caregivers that care enough to set boundaries. That doesn\u2019t mean beating a kid, doesn\u2019t even mean giving them a swat. Punishment should always be what is best suited to the kid. I knew kids it might be the only thing that would work. Others like my niece just needed to know  there was a limit and a consequence and I would follow through.", "I had to explain to a high school student the other day that while I appreciated their apology, apologies don\u2019t change consequences.", "Yeah, if I did this my parents would have taken every single one of my toys until every broken toy was replaced.", "Same. I was maybe 6 or 7 the year I went snooping, after being told numerous times not to, and I found the entire lot. I was too giggly to hide what I'd done. Mom literally put all my gifts under the tree, unwrapped and full of disappointment. Years later she admitted she hated to have to do that but I was told not to go snooping so I had to know about consequences. Something parents today are afraid of. Why do they think their kids will hate them? Sure I was upset that year, and I probably even said I hated her, I was 6 don't forget, but I learned a lesson that year, and I appreciate that she loved me enough to teach me a lesson even though it ruined her magic that year and broke her heart to do it.", "NGL, I  would have been beaten within less than a 1/2 inch of my life (along with several additional punishments).", "I\u2019m a 80s kid. I did this. Once. But I remember how sad my dad looked that I ruined it for everyone. I\u2019ll literally never forget that.", "As somebody who is from a part of India where we encourage everything BUT siblings getting married, I feel very left out of this stereotype.", "I\u2019m glad someone else noticed.", "Haha we were told to stay in our rooms until we were called, unless there was a fire. We did have a couple of little toys at the bottom of our beds, though, so that kept us occupied until it was time. It was actually quite magical, thinking back, but I know the intent was to keep us in our bedrooms until the adults got up.", "But notice how none of the other kids did this.. me and my siblings never did anything like this, we never even thought about it and there was no lock to our living room. \n\nWe just knew the we had to wait until morning. We liked waiting because we loved the excitement of waking up, trying to wake our parents, having to wait in anticipation, and then opening gifts altogether. \n\nI remember being told every Christmas eve that we had to wait until morning. Sometimes we would sneak out and look to see if the presents were there yet but never went further than the hallway.\n\nMaybe it's just my upbringing, I respected my parents and siblings and knew doing the wrong thing was bad, but I think a part of it is also creating that magic around Christmas and not making it purely about the gifts. Yes the gifts are the best part for a kid but then my dad would cook an insane breakfast and we would run to our neighbours and share what we had gotten, it was a whole thing", "exactly what I was thinking. \"She did it last year and nothing happened, let's try it this year.\"", "They might even just open and destroy Mindy's gifts while leaving theirs wrapped out of revenge.", "My sister and I were generally considered to be good kids. But in this scenario, 7 and 8 year old us would one thousand percent have gotten back at Mindy in some way. Kid justice can be swift and terrible.", "Yeah, but kids aren't morons. Half the presents were destroyed and then the one kid whose stuff was unharmed was mysteriously absent for the rest of the present-opening time. Not hard to put it together.", "Yup. Frame her as revenge, and completely nuke the chances of the cousins getting along. Even if the framer is caught, unless they get let off with a slap on the wrist like Mindy the previous year there will be resentment at being punished harsher than the person they view as starting everything.", "My parents set 0730 as the time I had to wait to so they could get some sleep\n\nJoke was on them, being their kid, I\u2019d sleep till like 9 and they\u2019d have to wake me up so we could get started. Once I was like 8 or so I think I just set an alarm. Christmases were great I just like sleeping.", "Yes, same! I'm going back just a bit short of 60 years (I'm 62) and that's what we had, too. A couple of little presents at the foot of our bed that Santa had left, and we were threatened with the wrath of Santa if we came out before we were told to. We could go to the loo, but that was it (UK family, one shared bathroom for the lot of us).", "That sounds like such a fun tradition!", "OMG.... \n\nI have ADHD too and you sound just like my brother and me!\n\nOne year, he (3.5 yrs older) had the idea of using a razor blade to slice open the tape and carefully unwrap and peek.... and you're right.  The surprise was not as fun... we knew what we were getting and it was a let down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only time presents were \"busted\" in to was when we came back from midnight church service to find one of the stockings taken down, the stocking completely emptied of toys, which were scattered around in various stages of being unwrapped, and the final toy, a catnip mouse, had been unwrapped, then chewed, then shredded, until it was trashed beyond identification, which is how we found it... a sodden remnant of fabric with one googly eye dangling.\n\nThe cat was passed out.", "Isn't it wonderful, having all those memories?? I remember my youngest one year, and he'd been THRUTCHING for a guitar. An electric guitar. \n\nI wrapped his tiny, gorgeous electric guitar (he was only 10) in soft wrapping paper, so it didn't quite have the shape of the guitar, but even though it was ambiguous, it wasn't exactly discreet. The lad was practically twitching, because he *knew* what it was, he just needed to confirm it and give it a name. \n\nA couple of nights before Christmas, we were all sitting on cushions on the floor watching a stupid Christmas film, and I was behind him. His hand sneeeeaaaked sideways, and his little fingers twiddled with the corners of the package, just having a touch. I just said, \"[Son], a good part of the film's coming up! Watch!\" and that hand shot back so fast hahaha!", "When my youngest was in the temptation stage, I wrapped empty boxes to decorate under the tree.  Had the look, and none of the risk. Then again, I get satisfaction from doing rhe wrapping.", "As a parent of a 6.5yo, I think this is the first year I\u2019m actually concerned about him getting the bright idea of opening early/peeking and bringing his 4.5yo sister along \ud83d\ude05\n\nHe absolutely knows the difference between right and wrong, but his impulse control has never been worse or his curiosity so intense. We\u2019re actively working on it, and I know it\u2019s a phase, but it\u2019s hard!", "I don't think my autistic and ADHD kid with poor impulse control would do this at a house he was comfortable in.", "This part struck me too. My 6 year old fell at school this year, fracturing her skull and sustaining a pretty good concussion. Because of the concussion, she has been a little emotionally different for the last couple months, especially by the end of the day when she's tired. Her impulse control has been bad, resulting in her doing things she normally wouldn't and herself being kind of shocked and confused that she did them too (things like lashing out or hitting).\n\nThat being said, she would NEVER in a million years do this. Not at our house on her own, and especially not at a guests home. Waking up early, sneaking into the front room, opening several gifts (ones she knew weren't hers), removing them from their packaging, playing with them until they broke, then moving onto the next gift.....that is not a normal 6 year old underdeveloped impulse control behavior. This was prolonged and there were several wrong decisions that she seemingly didn't see anything wrong with until she was caught. It's concerning. She had either no concept or care that what she did would definitely be discovered or be a problem. It's just very concerning.", "we should make a home alone reboot where the bandits are the neighborhood bullies", "And it's not even just the fact that Mindy opened them. A lot of commenters are missing the fact that she DESTROYED some of them, and conveniently none of hers were destroyed. It was another child's.

Within a couple years my mom even trusted me to wrap my own gifts (if they were in an unmarked box, of course), because she knew I would never peek inside.
