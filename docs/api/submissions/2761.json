My work is doing it next month and  his work one is today. He's allowed a plus one and I would've loved to go with him but he told me he was taking his 6 year old kid with him and he wasn't allowed to take more people. He said the kids would be getting presents but every employee would get presents for their kids to take home so she wouldn't be missing out on gifts if she didn't go. I think he should've taken me instead especially because his daughter spends weekends with her mom so he had to ask her mom to take her for extra time. He said some of his other coworkers were taking their kids with them but I told him most would probably take their partners and he agreed. \n\nThis is the first time ever that I'd be going at my work because Covid kinda made them not happen the past two years. So I'm not really sure how it's usually like.

Having to ask her mom for extra time is sweet, he is a good dad.

It\u2019s a difficult dynamic to merge lives when children are part of the family already. In many ways children come first, as they should. In other ways, the parents (or couple) come first.
