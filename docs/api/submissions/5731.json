Will skip that lesson.\n\nHere's a freebie - once you have a kid - you are a PARENT. Does not matter if, when or what the circumstances are.\n\nDo better. Raise this kid to be better than you. Fo the work man.", "YTA \n\nDude when your MOM needs to explain parenting 101 to you when you have a 5 year old child you will always be TA.\n\nYour ex brought your kid over in her weekend to see your family, and you get drunk.  I mean getting obviously drunk at your family\u2019s Christmas party is already an AH move.", "YTA and a crap father too if you only parent when it\u2019s \u201cyour weekend\u201d. News flash, if you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019re always on call. If that\u2019s how you look at it, don\u2019t be surprised when he has no interest in being around you later.", "Honestly? NTA. You\u2019re allowed to let loose a bit even if your child is there. Your ex clearly planned to stay sober so there was someone watching the kid. Not being fully attentive for a single evening doesn\u2019t make you a bad dad.", "Once again I\u2019m going against the herd on this one. Maybe cuz I don\u2019t have kids. But it sounds like you have shared custody and she decided to instead spend her time with y\u2019all son at your parents home. Well she should\u2019ve been watching him at this point", "Yta\n\nThat's never a state a child should see their parent in, maybe when they stop being a child, but especially not at 5.\n\nEdit to add, by not a child I mean an adult.", "What a role model! Definitely not winning father of the year! YTA", "The gene pool has no lifeguard......", "Happy cake day!! I agree YTA", "\ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, talk about an incredibly shitty role model. He sounds like a \"part time Dad\".", "Most parents would be ecstatic that they get to see their kids for Christmas, especially if it isn't \"their weekend\". I mean what the heck OP?!", "We live apart. We each get our weekends to spend our own time with him.", "Ok poor choice of words but I think people know what I meant.", "If I were his parents I'd call him a cab and send him home. Appalling behavior.", "I wasn\u2019t wasted. It was also Christmas.", "It also sounds like given a choice, OP doesn\u2019t care about his son spending time with his family for Christmas if that meant \u201csacrificing a night off\u201d \ud83d\ude44\n\nOP you have it so good and don\u2019t even know it - your ex and parents still maintain a good relationship. Enough so that she chose to spend \u201cher\u201d Christmas weekend with your son with YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. Even if she still gets along with your folks, she is doing this for the benefit of your son, who is now old enough to start making memories. You know, memories like  happy Christmas with mom, dad, grandparents and family.", "Is that a joke", "That\u2019s generous even crediting him with 50%", "She didn't need to ask", "No one should have to be asked to not be drunk in front of their 5 year old, seems pretty common sense.", "Did you not have birthday parties growing up? Parents drink around their kids, as long as you\u2019re functional and not plastered it\u2019s fine", "Nah, Festivus is for airing of the grievances, everyone knows that.", "It\u2019s a holiday to spend with family which he purposely avoided by getting drunk and when confronted about it he didn\u2019t care because it\u2019s \u201cnot his time to parent\u201d since it was the mom\u2019s weekend. You still should look after your kid and WANT to spend time with them even when it\u2019s not your day.", "I'm stealing this line, it's genius!!", "This is why YTA", "Roll your eyes schmuck-O, it\u2019s the top comment on your post.", "Lmao. It\u2019s so unfortunate that you reproduced. You have so much growing up to do.", "He sounds like the dads who say that they have to \u201cbabysit\u201d their own kids. No, it\u2019s calling *parenting*.", "You have part time custody, you aren\u2019t a part time dad.", "But he was there", "Does NOT matter\u2026 this is your son\u2026 on Christmas! Way to give him wonderful drunken daddy memories!", "Doesn\u2019t matter. You are still his parent. It doesn\u2019t matter one whit if it is \u201cyour\u201d weekend or not. You are his parent and if you are around him then you need to be able to parent him and be responsible for him. What would happen if your ex was unavailable because of some emergency? You couldn\u2019t say \u201coh, well, it\u2019s not my weekend so I\u2019m not responsible for him.\u201d  YTA. Do better.", "Who has him during the week?", "It was fucking Christmas.", "Something tells me you don't pay much attention to him on your weekends either.", "Is the rest of tge time equally split?", "So when he's physically in the room but it's not your weekend, you just ignore him? Wow poor kid...", "So? You think it\u2019s okay to be drunk in front of your kid just because it\u2019s not your week end? Do you get blotto\u2019ed every week end when it\u2019s not your week end? You sound like an alcoholic. And yes YTA.", "But this was Christmas at YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE!!!! You didn't want to experience that with your kid??", "We understand - we just don\u2019t agree with you.", "It\u2019s not a poor choice of words, it\u2019s a poor choice of mindset.  You are a parent, not a babysitter, and that\u2019s a full time commitment whether it\u2019s your weekend or not.", "I think we mostly don\u2019t understand who tf you think you are.", "The thing is, drinking should be prioritized last. You can drink later, after the party, after your ex has gone home with your son. Why is important to have unlimited drinks in front of him?", "\\>>AITA for **getting drunk** at the family Christmas party even though my kid was there because it was my ex\u2019s weekend to look after our son<<\n\nYou wrote that, didn't you?", "Christmas with your five year old is the LAST time you should be drunk.", "Don\u2019t you want to spend quality time with your kid on Christmas?", "Change \"wasted\" to \"drunk\" and the entire statement is still true.", "Lol. You are pathetic. You are also TA. People like you should not have children.", "If you think you had \"quite a buzz\", you were probably wasted in the eyes of those around you.", "No, that sounds like a completely legitimate question. Your action and words sound like you don't actually care about (maybe don't even love) your son. \n\nSo that question, or the question of \"do you actively dislike your son?\" are both completely relevant questions.", "No, but you are.", "Even if it was a joke, it still makes sense to ask. Why? Because you only want to spend time with your kid when it\u2019s your day, even when given the choice of spending a FAMILY holiday with your son you decided to nope out and get drunk.", "I think getting drunk is one of the best parts of Christmas! Love me some eggnog. \n\nSometimes parents agree that one of them will stay sober and watch the kid while the other one parties. I think it\u2019s okay and I think OP\u2019s logic about the kid\u2019s mom being the one \u201con call\u201d makes sense. He definitely should\u2019ve takes to her about it first, but it\u2019s okay to want to get a little drunk. You don\u2019t have to want to spend every spare second you have with your child.", "I like \"schmuck-O\". I might use that one. For some reason, I'm just imagining Judge Judy saying it.", "Idk from the sound of OP's post and his mature responses,  he sounds an awful lot like a part-time dad", "So much this. It was Christmas Day and OP checked out on being Daddy because it wasn't his weekend. YTA, OP, do better.", "So did I for some reason, this is the first time I said it but I\u2019m definitely using it more. Weird.", "Happy cake day", "Happy cake day!", "Thank you!"]}
