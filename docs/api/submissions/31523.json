Instead my brother says he has some shopping to do as well and he\u2019ll meet me at Walmart just 3 mins from my house. We do our shopping and he wants to continue hanging out as I\u2019m an awesome sister, so it\u2019s totally understandable. We return to his house where he wants to drink and play Mario cart; we do this for an hour while his fianc\u00e9 was sleep since she works overnight. When she wakes up she joins us & we play for another hour or so until I started losing and quit ( I hate Mario cart, I rarely win or even come top 3) it\u2019s about 4:30pm now so we all collectively agree on a show to watch, and my brother pours me a drink.\n\n As I\u2019m getting the show queued up he goes upstairs to shower at the most random time\u2026 so I pause it and wait. While I\u2019m waiting for him to get out I\u2019m just playing with their kids, loving on my niece, 20 mins go by when I notice my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was upstairs too. So I call her to see what she\u2019s doing; she comes down and says she need to grab some shorts for my brother. I tell her he took them upstairs with him I watched him do it. She continued look aimlessly around for something I already told her was not there. This annoyed me because why wasn\u2019t she listening. She retreated upstairs empty handed. Once up there she yells down \u201cGo head and start watching without us\u201d this is what let me know they were gonna have seggs. While me & their kids (2f and 8m) were fully awake downstairs at 5pm on a Sunday. I yelled back that they were both weirdos and if they wanted to f**k they could\u2019ve just said alright sis we\u2019ll see you later and I would have left. I cursed them out and went home. \n\nWhatever they do in their house while their kids are awake is their business, but I am not one of their children and you will not have me downstairs with your children or alone while you do the deed.

His fianc\u00e9 calls me 2 days later and is attempting to askme about work, I\u2019m giving one word answers and she asks me what\u2019s wrong. I tell her that I feel I am owed an apology and until I get one I won\u2019t be speaking to them or returning to their house. She said she felt an apology wasn\u2019t necessary because they were only gonna be 15 mins\u2026I tell her I\u2019m not staying downstairs while they do that no matter how long and she laughed a good belly laugh before I hung up on her. She\u2019s tried calling me back but I won\u2019t answer.

They tried to do the same thing on my birthday trip, we had one room and they wanted me to go out the room so they could do it and I paid for half they split the other half. I felt they should\u2019ve gotten their own room and we argued about that. So for it to happen again at their home just angered me. I felt if she had said \u201cgirl ya brother wants me to service him \u201d or \u201cThose drinks got us feeling a little touchy\u201d anything and I would have left. It was them trying to be sneaky and do it like I\u2019m one of their kids. I\u2019m a grown woman I know what doing the deed is and I understand.

Are you sure you're 26?  Because this reads like it's from a 16 year old.  Can't even say sex, instead using a made up word and doing it.  Really? Why do you find sex embarrassing?\n\nAlso why get mad because a married couple is having sex?  They don't have to announce it.  This seems pretty juvenile and immature.  It's very normal for couples to have sex with others around them.  If they didn't then most couples would never have sex, especially with kids.  I think you have some growing up to do.", "YTA purely for writing seggs. Like Jesus Christ, grow up, you\u2019re allowed to say sex here, and it\u2019s not a big deal that they wanted to have a quickie while they knew someone was watching the kids", "NTA.", "If the kink is humping while family is around and know that you\u2019re doing it ?
