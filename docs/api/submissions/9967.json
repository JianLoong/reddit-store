Of course, the words were hurtful. Justified tho.", "NTA -  I couldn't even finish reading because it's so triggering.  You are so NTA here.    Sorry you lived through that.", "NTA no contact means no contact", "NTA! Go no contact and tbh if your girlfriend enables that behavior and makes you out to be the bad guy then maybe you don\u2019t notice but that\u2019s a red flag.. look into your relationship and see if there other things you might have overlook.", "Look, I know that if this is true then this probably comes across as heartless, but seriously, humans can't go longer than 3-4 days without water without serious physical damage. I'm having a hard time believing that this is a real story.", "NTA, the last thing you need is your abusive sister sniffing around. How the heck did she find your number?  Be sure to block this number and screen any unknowns going forward.", "Definitely NTA. Nobody can even imagine what you went through or how you are feeling. You are well within your rights to be as nasty as you want to be to her, although it won't make you feel any better. Your girlfriend was probably taken aback as she may never have heard you speak like that before. Your NTA, but perhaps apologise to your girlfriend for upsetting her, it was your immediate reaction and you can't involve yourself with that", "NTA and set a boundary now. Let her know your relationship with your abusive sister is not her business other than to support you. There are too many stories on here for family members interfering in those types of boundaries so create a hard red line now before she takes it upon herself to try and help your sister without your knowledge.", "NTA. Your abuser called you asking for money without acknowledging or apologizing for past behavior.  Even though she is related to you, she is your abuser, and you owe her nothing.", "NTA. You\u2019ve established those boundaries for very good reasons and hopefully your gf will understand. Was it the nicest way to go about it? Not really, but from what you\u2019ve described, you have legitimate reasons to feel this way towards your sister. And if she is pregnant, I\u2019d be concerned the money would be going towards drugs and I wouldn\u2019t want to be complicit in that. She needs help, but ultimately that is her responsibility.", "Wait a second. How would your sister even have your phone number after going no contact?\n\nDid your girlfriend give your sister the number? \n\nNTA", "INFO how did she know to contact your GF and get her number? And, while your parents are deadbeats, did they really not notice that you were locked away for six days or is it that they agreed with the abuse? How is it that you went six days without water? And, how is it that your school didn\u2019t report such repeated absences?\n\nNTA but your story has quite a few details missing.", "NTA. Not even remotely. Jebus christmas, your sister has issues.", "Nta for not handing over money to a sister that was mentally and physically torturous to you.\n Could you been a little bit nicer of how you told her no? yes \n\nDoes your girlfriend know exactly the hell your sister put you through? Because if she does and says that I've been looking for new girlfriend.", "So when your sister locked you in a closet for 5 days for 6 times your parents never noticed you were gone? What about the school? And you survived for 5 days without water when  3 days is about the upper limit for humans to die without water because you are a super hero of some kind? While I don't doubt that you were traumatized by your sister, that part of the story is obviously exaggerated and doesn't make any sense. It could be the way your traumatized mind is remembering it, but our memories are extremely unreliable, particularly in cases of trauma.", "absolutely nta-girlfriend should know and be empathetic to what you went through. No coming back from that kind of torture.  Stay completely away from your \"sister\"", "NTA.\n\nLocking someone somewhere for multiple days without sensory stimulation, food, or water is LITERALLY A METHOD OF MEDIEVAL TORTURE. She put your life on the line, caused immense suffering, and wants money. Knowing her, there's a chance she's not even pregnant and just wants your money. Definitely huge NTA.", "NTA. Your sister is abusive and has problems. It would be healthy for you to not be involved.", "NTA she doesn't deserve the time of day from you let alone anything else. Could you have not twisted the knife?Probably. Was it worth it at a personal level from the abuse you took? Maybe. Either way you did suffer and now she will too. Karma's a bitch.", "NTA but maybe a tad harsh on the delivery of the message but don\u2019t fault you for what you have dealt with to cause this response GF should know how bad this triggered you and understand", "NTA. And I'm surprised your gf would say something like that to you, knowing what your sister had done to you. I agree that what you said was very very harsh, but imo that's what she deserves after putting you through hell and then not even apologize for it.\n\nI hope your gf understands where you're coming from because it's not like you yelled that at a random woman in the streets", "NTA. Sure, your words might sound harsh to someone who hasn't experienced the trauma and toxicity you did, but they don't get to live with the memories that haunt you. Also, your response to your sister is isolated **TO YOUR SISTER**. It's (hopefully) not behavior that is normal to you in any other circumstances.\n\nBTW, relay to your girlfriend that the things your sister did to you could have killed you. It was most likely her goal and she resented the fact that she didn't succeed.\n\nYOU DO NOT OWE YOUR ABUSER ANY KINDNESS.", "NTA. You gf probably has never seen you so harsh. \n\nI\u2019m my experience men don\u2019t go into great detail with their trauma. Have you told your gf everything?  In detail? Or did you say she abused me and gave her a tidbit here and there. If it\u2019s the latter, spill it all, in detail. That way she know why you were so harsh.", "NTA \n\nI say this a lot, but all actions have consequences\u2026this is her facing the consequences of the choices she made. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you one iota for not helping her. So either your girlfriend either truly doesn\u2019t know what she put you through, doesn\u2019t understand the lasting effects it has had, or has a severe bleeding heart personality\u2026and I\u2019m not sure which one is worse. Just know this may cause her to see you in a different light, but I think that\u2019s on her not on you. I wouldn\u2019t help your sister if she was mine.", "Naah OP doesn\u2019t owe anyone shit. His focus should be on his healing. And the moment he helps even just once it will never end. And how does he know if the money will be used for the child or if she is even really pregnant.", "NTA but I\u2019m worried about that baby?? Your sister sounds like she has some severe mental illness", "NTA", "Wow, the audacity to call you after everything she did and then ask you for money. I'm SO sorry you went through all that, and you are more than justified in refusing to help her and blocking her if that's what you want. Kudos to you on doing the work it takes to feel whole again. \n\nIt seems like something in your gf's history may have triggered her response, regardless, you are not remotely responsible for helping out your sister when she's really just attempted to insert herself into your life again in order to take advantage of you. Yay for good boundaries!\n\nOh, NTA, not remotely.\n\nGood luck on your journey, OP, I think you're gonna do just fine.", "Info does your gf actually know this history? Like do you talk about it and does she understand the severity of abuse?\n\nBecause either she's naive enough that she thinks you should be nice despite all that (wrong, but maybe just needs some education and context) or you have a communication breakdown and she thinks you were wrong  because she doesn't know what you went through (in which case her reaction at least makes more sense).\n\nRegardless you're NTA but you need a better read on the values breakdown your gf is showing you...", "From what you describe of your childhood, I can completely understand an impulse to say what you did, but it will not help you in the long run to repay her cruelty with some of your own.  It may feel good for awhile, but if you give into those impulses it will change you.  You will become angrier, less tolerant, and will dwell in the past, and victimhood.  I know this is easy for me to say because I did not live this type of trauma, but I would hope the best outcome for you would be to survive it in a way in which it does not permanently and negatively affect your personality, life-choices and relationships.\n\nAnd, by the way, I would not give her a cent if I were you, but there is a difference between setting boundaries and refusing to do something someone else wants, and doing all those things, but heaping cruelty on top of it.  Talk to your therapist about this.", "You are NTA for turning your sister away after what she did to you. But read that title again and ask yourself if that was an asshole thing to say. There's an innocent child who will be related to you coming into the world soon, and while you owe your sister nothing, the kid doesn't deserve to suffer for its bad luck in parents.", "YTA(ish) \n\nNot wanting to give your sister any money is understandable - NTA\n\nBeing angry with her and telling her no is understandable - NTA\n\nTaking pleasure in her pain is concerning though.  And the way you spoke to her made it seem like you were happy she was drug addicted and pregnant and vulnerable.\n\nI think you have a lot of trauma from your childhood that you need to unpack via therapy and I think that trauma scared your girlfriend, which is why she reacted the way she reacted\n\nPlease seek out therapy\n\nAlso...change your phone number", "NTA, congrats on being a father though.", "ESH\n\nShe's terrible for the reasons you listed. While your feelings in response to what she inflicted on you when younger makes your response understandable, it was still an objectively harmful outburst that served no purpose other to inflict pain upon her. You could easily have communicated that you were unwilling to help and requested she not contact you again without tacking on the suffering comment. \n\nIs her callous indifferent and outright harmful treatment of you acceptable? Obviously not. However, if you actually believe that, then you can't subsequently pretend its ok when you do the same or similar.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister is only 5 years older than you - for her to do those things to you isn't normal, and is likely a sign that she was abused in some way also. You don't owe her anything, certainly not any money, but there is a strong possibility that she needed help as a kid and was denied it.
