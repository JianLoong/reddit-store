When you sign a child up for competitive dance, you know what you\u2019re getting into far ahead of time. Unless you\u2019re dancing at a very unorganized and spontaneous studio, competition dates are planned many months in advance. One absent child requires the choreographer to do a lot of re-blocking, his teammates have to relearn their dance right before a competition, or worst case scenario the dance gets pulled. Depending on the entry deadline, you may also be forcing someone to eat the cost of the entry fee if re-blocking isn\u2019t an option.\n\nIf it were a solo, fine.

You said you knew the competition dates when you signed your son up.   Whatever the activity is, especially if it is a team, they rely on the kids to be there.  You have effectively affected everyone with your refusal to come up with a solution - especially all the other children who have worked hard to prepare.   \n\nThis coming from a 13 year competition athlete who relied on others.  Emergencies were one thing but parents who backed out or refused to make other arrangements cost us many times.  We trained 6 hours a day 6 days a week, sometimes more.  Worse yet, those parents agreed to those dates then didn\u2019t make them work and effectively took a spot from another athlete who could have made the team but didn\u2019t because there were only so many spots.   Our training cost us tens of thousands yearly and when parents/athletes flaked out it cost the rest of us advancement.  When we had stand-in athletes, it was unfair for them to train with us, pay the dues, but not be able to compete full time.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the age or activity, unless it\u2019s a true emergency, you should be willing to make the sacrifices to make sure you are where you previously committed to be otherwise don\u2019t commit to activities where your son\u2019s absence will be felt by others.", "Yta.

It's absolutely reasonable to not want to send your 8 year old on an overnight trip with someone you don't trust like that.  \n\nBut you are absolutely TA for conveniently leaving out it's a DANCE competition and for not finding someone you trust to take him. \n\nDance is not like soccer or baseball where you can just throw any kid in and call it good. There are no back up dancers. When you have a group of 4-20 kids it's impossible to teach one or two kids ALL the different roles in the dance. \n\nYou're TA for letting down all the other dancers.  I'm going to guess they've been practicing their routine(s) for the past 6 months, learning it one way, now they either have to learn a reworked routine in 1 month or have their routine pulled all together. This can absolutely ruin the competition for them.", "NTA. I\u2019d never let my 8 yo son stay in a hotel room with his coach. Fuck that nonsense. It\u2019s a sport for 8 year olds.

It\u2019s great that you want the make sure someone you trust is always present. I don\u2019t have kids but I\u2019ve seen enough coach related headlines to make me sick.", "NTA. I wouldn't trust a virtual stranger in a hotel room with my 8 year-old child, full stop. Maybe it's just me being a middle-aged man in today's world, but there's no way I'd feel comfortable putting myself in that position as the adult. I've worked with youth and part of the required training hammered on adults that try to engineer situations where it's just them and the kid(s). I get it's different as society doesn't attach this stigma to every woman like it does every man, but I'm conditioned to not even create the appearance of impropriety. It's just not worth the risk of my entire life being fucked over a false accusation. I'd be worried about the judgment of any adult that prioritizes a dance competition over this consideration. That she's greatly offended would only fuel my suspicions.\n\nAnd to everyone saying you should have planned better, fuck all the way off.

They are choosing to waste everyone's time and effort and if it was my kids club they would be kicked out and they would deserve it. \n\nThey are letting their son down too....showing him he is not a priority and they don't care about his love of dance.", "If there\u2019s no substitute for him, and the team needs a certain # to play, then yeah, that does suck for the other kids.", "They have probably choreographed the whole routine around the members on the team. Taking your son out means they have to redo the whole routine... Including choreography,. practice, etc.  \nIf you couldn't commit to going, then you shouldn't have put him on the team.", "Ok now i know you are TA!", "No wonder they're freaking. OPs kid may have been the only boy they had, or one of a very few. Still NTA, though!", "Especially at age 8.", "If this is such a highly competitive team, they should be able to adjust. I'm a dancer. Unless the choreography is very complicated, which it probably isn't at this age. They can work it out. Might be a good opportunity for them to learn this skill.", "The parents shouldn't have signed the kid up for this team, then. They are screening the whole team.", "Right? It's been a while since I read a comment so utterly and completely wrong around here.\n\nedit: check that. This entire thread has gone Bizarro. Over 1 8yo missing 1 competition. Jeebus Aitch Cripes.", "The kid isn't scared, he is nervous. The competition is a month away; there are lots of things they could try to make the kid more comfortable. The kid could do an overnight at the coach's house as a practice run. The parents could find a relative or a neighbor (someone the kid feels safe with) to go along and supervise. The problem here is that it doesn't sound like OP is interested in even looking for other options. It's just \"nope, I can't make it so screw the rest of the team.\"\n\nYTA", "Tell that to all the other kids on the team. It's important to THEM.", "Another parent I understand. The coach, though? I'd think that 1. they'd be too busy to take charge of an unaccompanied child and 2. the school or league or whatever wouldn't want the liability.", "He's got at *minimum* six more years before high school to have confidence-building adventures. A pushy coach who seems way too invested in getting the eight-year-old alone in a room with her is not the way to fucking start.", "Are you kidding? Why the hell are you writing \u201ccoach\u201d like it\u2019s some kind of nefarious villain pulling a long con? If they are traveling for competitive dance, those kids are around the coach all the time.\n\nAlso, the coach\u2019s daughter is on the team. If you\u2019re really unable to put trust in the person you have teaching your son to dance, find a friend or relative to attend. \n\nYou\u2019re hurting the chances of the entire team by making them revise the routine a month from competition. In some schools, this would be enough to get him dropped from the team.", "Fair enough. I didn\u2019t see anything about dance in the post, though.", "Was it 8 or 13?\n\nEither way, your point still stands", "They are choosing more important obligations over their sons dance hobby. Yes they committed to the schedule but shit happens! Life happens! It\u2019s not the end of the world like you\u2019re making it out to be. The team will make due. No one will die.", "Then that\u2019s on the coach for planning poorly. Sports have benches for a reason. Shit happens. You think they just forfeit if one person gets sick or hurt? You plan for that scenario", "They probably have alternates to jump in case someone gets hurt or sick\u2026or can\u2019t make it. If not then the coach is shit", "Again they\u2019re 8. Giving 8 year olds a month to relearn something isn\u2019t a lot of time", "They are EIGHT. It really isn't that deep sis.", "it's a team of eight year olds. I PROMISE you, whatever this competition is, it's not that serious. The team will survive.", "who sends their neighbor with their kid on a trip? tf?", "If a kid unable to attend for what ever reason endangers the whole team, the coach has fucked up!", "How do you know? You've spoken to each individual child?", "They\u2019ll make due. They\u2019ll Learn. They\u2019ll learn shit happens in life, things don\u2019t go as planned. Roll with the punches and figure it out. They\u2019ll learn about LIFE", "It really isnt that much going on. The most they would do is sleep in the same room. For comps you are with your team, practicing dances, or watching. This isnt just going out and hanging around", "I guess it depends, when you spend that much time working together, it didn\u2019t really feel weird to spend alone time with the coach. And the main times the coach would be busy is when the kid needed to be present anyway unless the coach was doing multiple age groups (which wasn\u2019t the case for our team but could be for theirs, idk).", "Do Larry Nassar and Jerry Sandusky ring a bell? You know how Larry Nassar sexual abuses his victims in front of their parents right? And got away with it for years right? Riiight?????? \n\nI worked child crimes, I don\u2019t think you realize how prevalent child sexual abuse is. I guess keep being naive and let your 8yo share a room with an adult that isn\u2019t a parent. Let some sports event be more important than your child\u2019s safety. Good on you.", "Absolutely. OP mentioned it in some of the comments. I think it was left out intentionally since the common assumption would be team sports where missing a single competition wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.", "Dance doesn't have a bench. Kids audition for comp teams and everyone is in the routine.", "Thats not a thing. This isnt broadway with understudies. There is no \"replacement\" to just jump in", "I danced competitively for 14 years. Never once did we have alternates. Having alternates is not at all the norm. If someone has to miss a show or competition the dance at minimum has to be re-spaced and parts will likely need re choreographed.", "It is this deep though. If you can't travel with your child to competitions and your kid won't travel without you, then a travel team is obviously not the right fit for your kid. Whatever activity this is, I'm sure there are other non competitive teams that is better for this family.", "Do now none of the other 8 year olds get to compete. Super awesome, bro.", "Yes. Yes I have. And I've spoken to all of their parents as well. I also contacted the governing body of the dance competition, the hotel manager where they'll be staying, and the local sheriff's department. Every single one of them told me that OP was TA.", "But shit hasn't happened yet. The competition is still a month away and OP is just throwing in the towel: \"whoops, nothing I can do.\" They're not even trying to find an alternative solution. That's not a good life lesson to teach.\n\nRight now, OP is teaching the lesson that you don't need to honor a commitment.", "That's my point. He's only eight, and he'll only have one completely distracted adult and a preteen child looking out for him while \"there isn't that much going on\"? Recipe for disaster in my opinion.", "If you worked child crimes you know the stats for abuse by parents or other family members too. It\u2019s sure as sh*t not uncommon. You keep talking like parents are the one safe person but that isn\u2019t a guarantee.\n\nThe majority of people are good. You need to learn how to make judgements based on actual people in your life instead of the worst part of humanity that you see in your job.", "And if someone gets hurt or sick or can\u2019t make it then they adjust and make it work.", "But it happens. And the team gets through it. It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "Huh?", "They\u2019re teaching some obligations are more important than others", "It wont be just that one adult. Parents go to competitions. There are plenty of adults of kids he dances with that i am sure woulf be more than willing to watch him. All the coach would really do us provide a bed and transportation. Kids are rarely just hanging with their parents at comps. They are with eachother, in groups, practicing their dances or watching the other dances going on."]}
