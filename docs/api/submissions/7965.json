When you sign a child up for competitive dance, you know what you\u2019re getting into far ahead of time. Unless you\u2019re dancing at a very unorganized and spontaneous studio, competition dates are planned many months in advance. One absent child requires the choreographer to do a lot of re-blocking, his teammates have to relearn their dance right before a competition, or worst case scenario the dance gets pulled. Depending on the entry deadline, you may also be forcing someone to eat the cost of the entry fee if re-blocking isn\u2019t an option.\n\nIf it were a solo, fine.

You said you knew the competition dates when you signed your son up.   Whatever the activity is, especially if it is a team, they rely on the kids to be there.  You have effectively affected everyone with your refusal to come up with a solution - especially all the other children who have worked hard to prepare.   \n\nThis coming from a 13 year competition athlete who relied on others.  Emergencies were one thing but parents who backed out or refused to make other arrangements cost us many times.  We trained 6 hours a day 6 days a week, sometimes more.  Worse yet, those parents agreed to those dates then didn\u2019t make them work and effectively took a spot from another athlete who could have made the team but didn\u2019t because there were only so many spots.   Our training cost us tens of thousands yearly and when parents/athletes flaked out it cost the rest of us advancement.  When we had stand-in athletes, it was unfair for them to train with us, pay the dues, but not be able to compete full time.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the age or activity, unless it\u2019s a true emergency, you should be willing to make the sacrifices to make sure you are where you previously committed to be otherwise don\u2019t commit to activities where your son\u2019s absence will be felt by others.", "Yta.

It's absolutely reasonable to not want to send your 8 year old on an overnight trip with someone you don't trust like that.  \n\nBut you are absolutely TA for conveniently leaving out it's a DANCE competition and for not finding someone you trust to take him. \n\nDance is not like soccer or baseball where you can just throw any kid in and call it good. There are no back up dancers. When you have a group of 4-20 kids it's impossible to teach one or two kids ALL the different roles in the dance. \n\nYou're TA for letting down all the other dancers.  I'm going to guess they've been practicing their routine(s) for the past 6 months, learning it one way, now they either have to learn a reworked routine in 1 month or have their routine pulled all together. This can absolutely ruin the competition for them.", "NTA. I\u2019d never let my 8 yo son stay in a hotel room with his coach. Fuck that nonsense. It\u2019s a sport for 8 year olds. The competition is not that important. There will be others", "YTA. Do you sell tickets to your helicopter, the one you parent from?", "NTA. Scheduling fuckups happen. Your child is 8. It\u2019s great that you want the make sure someone you trust is always present. I don\u2019t have kids but I\u2019ve seen enough coach related headlines to make me sick.", "NTA. I wouldn't trust a virtual stranger in a hotel room with my 8 year-old child, full stop. Maybe it's just me being a middle-aged man in today's world, but there's no way I'd feel comfortable putting myself in that position as the adult. I've worked with youth and part of the required training hammered on adults that try to engineer situations where it's just them and the kid(s). I get it's different as society doesn't attach this stigma to every woman like it does every man, but I'm conditioned to not even create the appearance of impropriety. It's just not worth the risk of my entire life being fucked over a false accusation. I'd be worried about the judgment of any adult that prioritizes a dance competition over this consideration. That she's greatly offended would only fuel my suspicions.\n\nAnd to everyone saying you should have planned better, how? Y'all know how absolutely ridiculous the labor situation is in this country.

She will have a lot of demands on her time and attention while they are away. 8yos still need a lot of supervision and support, no way would the coach be able to give it in those circumstances. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting from your comment is that, yes, if one dancer is sick and cannot preform, then there is no way a competitive dance group can win, because there is no possible contingency. The choreography is ruined, and so the team might as well cancel. I guess that\u2019s the sport, but it must lead to an awful lot of empty spaces at competitions, because kids get sick or injured or have family emergencies all the time.\n\nAs a community theatre dancer (not competitive, so I know it\u2019s different), we never cancel if one or two dancers are out.

Of course not. But it also isn\u2019t a cheap sport and there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into it.

I was never alone or without supervision even though they were often \"busy\". I was also always with other kids my age, older kids, and parents every where. I will also say that for the most part no one got sick, or lucked out and got sick not on a comp week. I did a couple times. Know what i did? Took some ibuprofen and competed. Not saying its the best option, but its what you do for what you love and who you love. Dances could still happen, again it would require a lot of unnecessary work and stress on other kids/teacher for a non emergency. Not to keep adding on, but he also just didnt need to be a comp kid.

They won\u2019t have to relearn it. There\u2019s  only one dancer missing, probably just requires a little spacing reshuffle and role redistribution here and there. Depends on the choreography.
