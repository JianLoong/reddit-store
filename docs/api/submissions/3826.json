That's awkward af, but it sounds like a misunderstanding. I would be mad too. Curious though- did she have her hands full/messy and he just answered and put it on speaker for her or something?", "Mom was mistaken to have the phone on speaker without revealing it to you.  You said it was only a couple of minutes until you realized that speakerphone was on.    You were angry.   Did the chewing out take seconds or minutes or tens of minutes.  Was mom offended by your remarks?  All of these are relevant to determining whether you are wrong.", "ESH you could have expressed your feelings better and mom could have given you heads up .", "A light YTA.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t say anything horrible or embarrassing otherwise you would have specified in your post. (Or you DID say something embarrassing and you\u2019re now ashamed a new person heard you, and you don\u2019t want to admit it). I get wanting to expect a little privacy, but if you had a totally innocent conversation with your mom up until you found out you were on speaker, chewing her out is an overreaction. You could have simply said, \u201cMom, in the future, can you let me know when I\u2019m on speaker ahead of time? It feels like an invasion of my privacy when someone else is listening and I\u2019m not aware, and i don\u2019t appreciate our conversations being aired to the world.\u201d \n\nAlso, my mom doesn\u2019t tell anyone they\u2019re on speaker phone, including me, but it\u2019s literally the only way she talks to anyone on the phone, so I already know ahead of time. I wonder if it\u2019s a generational thing.", "ESH.\n\nShe should've told you that you were on speakerphone, and you could've handled it better. \n\n> embarrassed her in front of her new boyfriend.\n\nHonestly, given your passive aggressive comment and the fact you \"chewed her out\" you probably embarrassed yourself more than you embarrassed her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure if she was offended or not, she seemed to laugh it off.", "If she does it again make up a scenario to embarrassing her. \"Remember how I bailed you out after your DUI last week, have you started going to AA yet?\" \"Hey Mum why did you install cameras in my bathroom?\" \"Yeah I am calling to ask you to start repaying all that money I lent you to pay off your gambling debt.\" \"You better check Facebook one of your racist rants was recorded and is posted online.\" \"How did you gyno appointment go was it an STI or not?\" \n\nOkay I am having fun with these.", "Lol, if she gets all braggy and proud, I bet your scolding embarrassed her.
