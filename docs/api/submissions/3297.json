I think that what she wears is inappropriate. She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's just \"her style\" and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't \"feel comfortable\" in them.\n\n\nLast night, I saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing, that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then stormed off to her room.\n\n\nWe haven't talked since then and she is refusing to talk about it.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna post a pic of the nightgown but don't know how. I'll see what I can do.\n\n\nEdit: here's the dress.

But I also definitely wouldn't wear a slip type nightgown without a bra anywhere my BIL might possibly see, especially if my own sister was uncomfortable. \n\nI'm leaning towards e s h just because the OP definitely seems to have approached this really aggressively with the sister and does come off as very controlling and insecure, but on the other hand, different people have different standards of modesty and there should be at least some effort on the sister's part to not make her hosts uncomfortable in their own home.

Those overalls and long sleeve shirts are the next progression", "more like her boobies bouncing about w: her nips probably out & the satin highlighting and hugging every curve. you guys would really wear something like this around family?", "She posted a picture and it\u2019s exactly what I thought it was. Her sister is wearing lingerie. And this sub is insane for thinking OP is the asshole. Sister can dress appropriately or find a new place to live.", "Yeah. Me too. Black in my case lol.", "and a lot of that kind of nightware doesn\u2019t near to be see through. it\u2019s super accentuating and like highlights all the dips, curves, nips, etc", "Me too. It's in black and goes all the way down to my shins but the way that it fits on my body is actually super revealing. Walking around my house I'm even sometimes worried about passing the window to close the blinds so it definitely  depends on the cut and fabric whether it's OP overreacting or not", "There is a difference between a knee length nightgown and a negligee", "Knee-length silk nightgown \u2260 lingerie (at least not in the way that the term lingerie is typically used; OP has already made it clear that she does not have a problem with pyjamas being worn around the house)\n\nObviously we don't know exactly what it actually looked like but based on OP's description (which, if anything, you'd think would be biased toward the more risq\u00e9 side), it does not sound like lingerie.", "I sleep in silky jammies (nightgowns and shorts) from Walmart/TJ Maxx. I don't think it;s the see through nightgown from Elf people are envioning. It's christmas time- buy her a personalized bathrobe with her initials on it and problem solved. My mother and her sisters are like that where it's a shame for anyone to see you in pajamas at all- whenever we all sleep at my granpas house they will stay in regular clothes until right before everyone is in bed.", "Bruv, just cause clothing is sexy doesn't make it lingerie.", "I agree. The sister could always wear a bathrobe when in the common areas of the house. OP is NTA.", "Silk nightwear isn\u2019t lingerie", "Where did she say it was lingerie and not a KNEE LEGNTH nightgown.", "There are rules that make you an asshole even in your own house\n\nLike making all your guests pay for their meal when you invite them over for dinner\n\nOr maybe blasting the TV 24/7 to the point anyone else in the room gets a migraine.\n\nOr letting your animals jump and bark at people.\n\nJust because something is yours doesn\u2019t mean you are spared from being an asshole.", "A robe was my suggestion as well and maybe OP should get her one for Christmas. That's a reasonable expectation from a houseguest imo. It seems weird that her sister is getting so defensive about it and I wonder if she's looking for validation from OPs husband because of her divorce. I know I was pretty messed up while I was going through that.", "That's rough buddy", "My vs pjs consist of 2000s bubble gum pink, randomly laced tank tops that go to my knees if I stretch them alongside the frilliest shorts you can imagine. Yeah, it\u2019s lacy pink vs \u201cnightwear\u201d but even I don\u2019t wanna see myself in it. It\u2019s just so damn comfy I can\u2019t say no", "would you wear a knee length clingy silk spaghetti strap neglige with no bra to work or the grocery store?  why or why not?", "Tell me you\u2019re a parrot without telling me you\u2019re a parrot.", "I've gone clubbing less covered than that.", "Same as mine.  That\u2019s why I asked if people would be upset about that.  If they weren\u2019t I\u2019d say they are being hypocrites.", "Agreed", "Oh my God look at those knees I can't control myself anymore", "Oh myyy", "A simple test is whether the garment is something you'd wear to answer the door. If you'd ignore the bell or throw on a robe, then you probably don't need to walking around a shared home in that item.", "Lingerie does include sexy nightgowns. In thd old days they usually had a little sheer robe thing to go with it. You would have them as part of a hope chest or troussou along with your girdle and stocking and other undies these types of nightwear were part of things you would need to look sexy for your new husband when you go to bed.", "She posted a picture. It\u2019s lingerie.", "i mean it kind of is tho. like if it\u2019s firm cutting, that\u2019s considered lingerie. also idk how regular pjs are uncomfortable for her. \n\ni doubt she\u2019s walking around in a mumu style satin nightgown. i doubt that would bother OP. i think it\u2019s pretty clear she\u2019s wearing a relatively form fitting nightgown that goes only to the knees without undergarments", "Silk nightwear is clingy and semi transparent.", "the way she\u2019s describing it, sounds like lingerie. i can\u2019t even buy nightgowns like she describes at like walmart or target because they consider it lingerie. i know because i\u2019ve wanted some as **sexy** sleepware", "I'm thinking it's a see through negligee lol", "Who cares? OP doesn't like it and it's her house.", "Because a chemise or babydoll nightgown are absolutely classed as lingerie. Maybe, you like your lingerie more hard core, but you would still buy those items in the lingerie section of the store.\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingerie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingerie)", "Asking your younger sister not to wear lingerie around your husband is not one of those things though.", "I'd answer the door in that gown. Anything else?", "Okay well maybe it's just me but OP's description does not make me think \"sexy nightgown\", it makes me think \"normal nightgown\".", "Judging by that Wikipedia page robes and sleepwear is also lingerie so do you think OPs sister should change into jeans and a t shirt before she gets up to pee at night?", "Ditto. Throw a cardigan over that and I\u2019d wear it to Kroger if I needed to for some milk or something lmao. Not all of us are so hoity-toity", "as someone who is roommates with 3 straight men, i wouldnt feel comfortable walking out into the common areas wearing one of my nightgowns. i have one that is similar to the picture OP linked, and it would be super inappropriate for me to walk around the house like that.\n\nand im not a prude or anything either! i wear sexy clothes all the time. the nightgown is definitely intimate and revealing!", "That says a lot more about the men you live with than you."]}
