I think that what she wears is inappropriate. She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's just \"her style\" and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't \"feel comfortable\" in them.\n\n\nLast night, I saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing, that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then stormed off to her room.\n\n\nWe haven't talked since then and she is refusing to talk about it.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna post a pic of the nightgown but don't know how. I'll see what I can do.\n\n\nEdit: here's the dress. It's not identical but close to what she was wearing, very close.\n\n\n\nhttps://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1qKAoff2H8KJjy0Fcq6yDlFXav/3-Colors-Adult-Women-Claret-Black-Night-Gown-Ladies-Spring-Autumn-Lace-Silk-Sleep-Dress-Knee.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp\n\n\n\nLook at it and give judgement.

Lol cool you don\u2019t like it, gtfo end of sentence", "I have lots of nighties like this and I don't even walk around my own house in them without putting on pj bottoms or a robe. And we don't have guests here. Plus at this time of year they're cold as heck.", "Oh no I agree 100%. My original comment was being sarcastic, and the way OP was talking I expected the sister to be wearing like lingerie or something\u2014the picture being added didn\u2019t help her case at all, although my image of her wearing a grandma\u2019s nightshirt with one of those hats with a pom pom on the end was effectively ruined.", "I routinely go clubbing in like half that amount of coverage. My day to day outfits would still probably be less since I like dresses, shorts, and mini skirts", "Jokes on you i never answer the door", "I have seen that nightgown on the London fashion week walkway. Frankly, it\u2019s verging on outerwear.", "What's this difference between this and a slip dress?\n\nMany many people would answer the door wearing this. Slip dresses are not much different than this and are worn out and about", "I hate pj's. I only wear baggy tops, it's a sensory thing. They can be very uncomfortable for people.", "Just curious where you're getting that she isn't wearing 'under garments' from? Also, tons of people find pj's uncomfortable. Far more than you could possibly imagine based on your comment. A- silk is considered one of the best fabrics to wear for bed, as is cotton. B- We're often confined to shirts/pants etc for thr majority of the day. It gets uncomfortable. A night dress like the one pictured, is breathable, feels good on the skin, and creates easier access for things like using the bathroom. Skin needs to breathe, not be covered 24/7. And it's not like the sister is walking around and 8pm in this nightgown. OP has randomly seen her in the early hours of the morning simply getting a glass of water or heading to the bathroom. She's by no means flaunting herself all over the house at all hours of the day/night. It's fairly clear here that OP is worried about her husband having a wandering eye or finding her sister attractive, so much so that if he were to see her in this night gown, OP would then have a huge argument with her husband over it, which screams that someone is projecting their insecurities onto someone else. That says far more about OP and her marriage than it does the sister wearing what she's always worn to bed. There's a problem here that runs much deeper than her sister wearing a dang night gown. Yes it's OPs house, but the way she's acting makes it seem like sister is wearing a sheer piece of lingerie to draw attention to herself, when that is 100% not the case. I mean come on, this poor woman has just gone through a divorce and lost her home because of it. The last thing she needs is to be put on trial for something so trivial.", "This is a fair retort; out of sheer curiosity, would you be fine with an unveiled/uncovered houseguestwearing this exact nightgown walking around your house? BC I'll be honest, I've stayed in Muslim homes (friends of friends hosted me in Jordan) and I would never wear the liked item. LIKE...EVER lol (in fact, in my case went extra far with my sleeping and even day around the house attire bc even though they weren't super religious I was decently sure it would make folks uncomfortable), but maybe I was doing too much? If you were at your own sister's boyfriend's house would you do the same? Even in the US, I wouldn't lol. I just...might be more modest than some, but I don't think my response is quite so unusual? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike....I'm a pretty when in Rome person. I wouldn't have this rule EVER, but if someone says they're uncomfortable I am not the type to be like, SCREW YOU I WEAR WHATEVER I LIKE AT ALL TIMES, you know? I wear what I want in MY house ofc, though.", "\u201cShe has a reasonable expectation that no one will see her\u201d.\n\nExcept, the whole reason we\u2019re having this conversation is because someone did see her.  Reasonable expectation eliminated.", "I don't think the length is the issue.  The lace offers the opportunity of a nipple reveal, and that would be inappropriate.  But if you'd answer the door with visible nipples, your mailman must love you.", "Exactly. There was a time when I could only sleep in something silky like the nightgown shown due to insomnia and sensory issues.", "1. because most women don\u2019t definitely don\u2019t sleep with a bra on and it\u2019s recommended to lit the kitty air out as well so that\u2019s how i sleep when in a slip dress. she may have undies on but why would she be wearing a bra? \n\n2. there\u2019s tons of different types of silk PJS. there\u2019s too and bottom sets as well as nightgowns with way more coverage. it\u2019s not unusual for them to be made with cap sleeves. if you MUST sleep in silk. i understand having textural issues - i\u2019ve struggled to get a handle on mine for a big part of my life but i just don\u2019t see how this singlular nightgown is the only thing that can work for her. \n\n3. idon\u2019t think OP had a right to police what she SLEEPS in, but i do this it\u2019s fair for OP to ask her to wear a robe in common spaces.\n\n4. i really think that\u2019s a big assumption that OP is jealous or insecure. it just may also make her husband uncomfortable. HE might not like it. and honestly it\u2019s irrelevant what her reason is. maybe she needs therapy or something but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that RIGHT NOW this is something she\u2019s uncomfortable with and her sister is completely disregarding her feelings which is shitty\n\n5. \u201ccan you wear something less revealing in common spaces\u201d = put on trial ? no", "This right here. There are clothes that show much more then this that people wear outside.   \n\n\nI was expecting something a little shorter and revealing when I read the post then I saw the pic. It could pass for a dress if it was made of a different material.", "Sigh, the sluts never try to steal me. I'll just go home to my hot wife that cooks in her underwear.", "Some of my summer dresses are more revealing and shorter than this nightgown, guess I wouldn\u2019t be allowed in OPs house during the summer months \ud83e\udee0", "Every time I leave the house in a dress like that, I get at least one or two marriage proposals.", "There was a whole fashion trend around wearing slips in the 90\u2019s.", "You need to get a dress like the one in the OP!", "This was a total look in the 90s. I love it!", "It was a [hot look](https://images.app.goo.gl/chFgMRccfL4WM63e7)."]}
