A comfy robe is the perfect compromise here.", "Knee length isn\u2019t the problem, \u201csilky\u201d spaghetti strap is the problem\u2026she\u2019s basically walking around in a *neglige*  in her sister\u2019s home when her husband is there.", "I\u2019m not saying the OP is right, but claiming a nightgown is no different from a dress without having seen it is just silly. Nightgowns can be more clingy and provide less coverage, and they\u2019re generally worn without a bra. It\u2019s possible the sister is wearing something pretty revealing. \u201cKnee length\u201d does not mean \u201cjust like a dress.\u201d", "OP has every right to decide what she wants the rules to be for her own home, and her guests have every right to leave if they find the rules unreasonable. It really is that simple.\n\nI don\u2019t think this rule is outrageous. Slightly silly, but OP has a right to be slightly silly in her own home for her own peace of mind.", "While that is tempting, I don't think she would wear it. \ud83d\ude02 A long silky robe might be worn.", "Did I miss the description somewhere?", "Uncomfortable seeing her ankles and feet? Fuck that guy", "It\u2019s to her KNEES.  Covers the major bits.  No worse than a tank top and shorts.  It\u2019s late at night when she\u2019s grabbing something or going to bathroom.  It\u2019s not like she\u2019s parading around in skimpy clothes to provoke them.", "People wear silk clothes all the time? As well as spaghetti straps\u2026", "Agree to disagree.  Rules sure.  Clothing no.", "Omg or her delicious knees! Exposed knees just drive men wild these days /s", "I feel strongly that you are wrong.\n\n1 OP has an *unquestionable* right to be comfortable in their own home.\n\n2 What OPs sister is doing makes OP uncomfortable.\n\n3 OPs sister *does not have a right* to stay in OPs home.\n\nAs a result the only way to resolve this is for either OPs sister to do what OP asks, or to leave. OP does not have a duty to be uncomfortable in her own home for something as minor as her sisters right to walk around in her nightgown. Your expectation is completely unrealistic.", "What if it\u2019s summertime and sister wants to wear shorts and a tank top??  Would you say the same thing?\n\nIt covers the same amounts.\n\nShe\u2019s uncomfortable because of her husband.  If she has a problem take it up with him not the sister.", "Sister has every right to wear what she wants, I agree. But OP does not have a duty to house sister, and can make sisters stay contingent on sister following a rule. If sister values her right to wear what she wants more, she can find her own accommodations.\n\nYou seem to feel very strongly that OPs comfort in her own home isn\u2019t worth much. Where\u2019s your empathy?"]}
