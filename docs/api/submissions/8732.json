The fact that she will be the maid of honor also means that you would be spending a lot of time alone if you went to her friend's wedding.", "NTA there's no reason two grown adults can't go to separate functions. Sounds like the typical insecure \"we go everywhere together\" mentality.", "NTA You are not choosing your friend's wedding over her. You are choosing your friend's wedding over her friend's wedding, as is natural. Your gf comes off as self-involved. Does she not see that you also have a right to friends?", "NTA\n\nThe conflict is unfortunate. Each attending your respective friend's wedding seems like the best way to handle it. She's welcome to be disappointed but the guilt trip needs to stop.", "NTA at all dude. You each have friends getting married the same day. Why wouldn\u2019t you go to your respective friend\u2019s wedding?\n\nThe issue of you needing to be there because she is the MOH is ridiculous. Being a MOH is about her being there for the bride, not you being there for the MOH. I\u2019m willing to bet that at her friend\u2019s wedding you will know three people: your GF, the bride, and the groom. So, who are you supposed to hang out with while your GF is off doing her MOH duties? She will be preoccupied with being there for the bride and you\u2019ll be chilling at the bar putting out the vibe. \n\nSeveral years ago, I was a groomsman for a friend of mine. The wedding was out of state and my wife didn\u2019t go because we just recently had a baby and the pediatrician advised against flying with our baby if we could help it until she was 3 months old. So, I went to the wedding by myself. I missed my wife and baby for the weekend, but them not being there allowed me to focus all my attention on the groom. I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my wife and baby were having fun. \n\nThat is how I would approach this with your GF. By you not going to her friend\u2019s wedding, she can focus all of her attention on the bride. She won\u2019t have to worry about whether you\u2019re having fun at a wedding where you know no one else.", "NTA - And honestly, stick to your decision.  She will be VERY VERY busy the entire day--up thru *at least* after dinner.   You'd just be tagging along to be there in her short down times between pictures, set ups, etc.  until later in the evening.   That is where she'll be bummed; the slow dances, etc... You will definitely regret missing a good friends wedding - if covid taught us anything - it's that nothing is guaranteed.", "NTA, any normal person would completely understand why you would want to go to your friends wedding over what is basically just acquaintance. Your gf is being pouty and unreasonable and is showing her true colors to how she handles not getting her way.", "NTA things like this happen. It\u2019s okay to go to weddings separately occasionally. My husband and I were in a very similar situation a while back and we went separately. Sounds like this is a good friend of yours.", "NTA. Generally you would like to go to weddings together, but sometimes scheduling doesn\u2019t work out. Both of you should go to your own friend\u2019s weddings and text during. Maybe come up with some sort of game/bingo to feel connected while at separate weddings.", "NTA - from experience, the partner of the maid of honour is going to be sitting alone, entertaining himself\u2026 if you don\u2019t know anyone else in attendance then it\u2019s not going to be awesome for you! She should 100% respect your decision!! And you will both have the best days celebrating your people!", "NTA.\n\nYou want to go to your friend's wedding, that's fine\n\nShe wants to go to her friends wedding, that's fine.\n\nShe expects you to go to her friend's wedding, but I predict she would decline to go your friend's wedding if asked?", "NTA\n\nYour gf can be sad you're not going with her, but she should get over that and support you as you've supported her.\n\nShe should not be trying to also make you feel bad for it or guilt tripping you.

I would think she'd be happy you had a conflict because she's not going to have any time to spend with you anyway.", "NTA \n\nShe wants you to prioritize her friends over your good friends.   \n\nThat's selfish and shows that she has little thought for you or your friends.   It's only *her* friends that are important.   (um... no.)\n\nShe can mope all she wants but each of your friends should have their good friends with them on their wedding day. \n\nShe's making more out of this than she needs to.", "Nta. And trust NOTHING is worst amyhan being at a wedding you aren\u2019t a part of and your partner is. It can be  boring and lonely", "NTA -- the maid of honor isn't the bride and she is there to support her really good friend. Since, you have essentially the same scenario... I don't see how you can be the AH. Assume you aren't in the other wedding party because for some reasonable explanation? Could see your GF looking at that as not comparable to her actually being in the wedding party, but not all weddings are the same in that respect.", "NTA.  She's going to be busy most of the day anyway.  You are also allowed to go to your friends wedding.", "NTA\n\n>  I don\u2019t know if I will be in my friends wedding but I am invited to his bachelor party.\n\nThere is no argument for why you need to go to her friend's wedding that you can't equally use for why she needs to go to your friend's wedding.", "NTA. \n\n\nYou should both enjoy your friends' weddings. \n\n\nYou are both adults who had friends before you met. You both want to attend the wedding for meaningful reasons. It only makes sense for you each to attend your special event.", "This literally happened to me and my fianc\u00e9. I was in my besties wedding and he had a close friends wedding. We went separately to our weddings. I wish he could\u2019ve come and met all the family friends but I would have been busy with bridesmaid stuff. Plus then I could give more of my attention to the bride instead. NTA", "NTA \n\nIs your girlfriend is under the delusion that it\u2019s HER wedding? Because being a maid of honor is not a milestone by which you determine your value to someone based on whether they show up for you. \n\nTell her you need to be at your friend\u2019s wedding just like she needs to be at her friend\u2019s wedding. This is such a nonissue.", "NTA. Support your friend! Sometimes weddings fall on the same day and it's ok for you and your SO to go to different weddings.", "NTA there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t support your good friend just like she is supporting her good friend. Plus you would be spending lots of time alone during the wedding and reception if you were to go with your gf as she is fulfilling her MOH duties.", "NTA\n\nThis is more about personal boundaries than anything. \n\nShe may not realise it but the fact she is demanding you be present for her, even though her focus will be on being present for her friend, implies that she is emotionally unable to function in the world without you.\n\nIt makes me question her motivation for her attempts at manipulating you so strongly. Why does she need you there? Is she physically/emotionally/mentally disabled in some way that she feels she needs your presence to be able to cope with the demands of being in a bridal party?\n\nOr is this about controlling you, forcing you to become an extension of her and her wants rather than allowing you to have interests, friends and desires or needs independently of her?\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners would go and attend their respective friends\u2019 weddings and keep connected with a few pics and \u2018I love you/miss you\u2019 texts. \n\nIt really is not about you being TA at all, it\u2019s about your gf emotionally manipulating you into believing you have to do things her way. Only you will know whether this behaviour is warranted or not as you are in the better position to understand her insecurities. \n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not a healthy dynamic.", " NTA. Why should you consider her friend more important than your friend?", "Nta. She is being unreasonable.", "NTA at all, she sounds very immature. \n\nThere is no reason you both shouldn\u2019t be able to go to your separate friends weddings, have an amazing time and share some cake and stories the next day!", "NTA. Go to the wedding that means something to you. If you and your gf work out, there will be more you can go to together.", "YNTA. One of your best friends is getting married, you have every tight to chose that occasion over the wedding of her best friend. It's a pity that both parties coincide, but she can't expect you to forsake your friend over hers.", "Ask her if she\u2019d be willing to relinquish being MOH and come to your friend\u2019s wedding as your date.

Then ask her why it\u2019s okay for her to basically ask you do the same. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nShe's not even gonna have much time to spend with you since she's MOH - you would be sitting by yourself at least 95% of the time.", "nta", "NTA just because you are seeing each other doesn't mean you have to be joined at the hip for something like this. Both have valid reasons to go the respective weddings alone.", "NTA. You have a legitimate reason for not going to the wedding. In fact. She\u2019s being really selfish as well, considering the reason.\n\nIt\u2019s great to be supportive of your girlfriend\u2026 but she also needs to realize you had a life before you met her and you have your own friends\u2026 and will continue to have your own friends and life outside of her. If she can\u2019t understand that\u2026 it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship.", "NTA.  She's being unreasonable.  You may want to point out that SHE is picking her friends wedding over going to the other wedding with you.  She's a hypocrite.     She's going to spend the day with her friends, and you have every right to spend the day with yours.     \n\nUnfortunately, you've spent two years with this girl, who seems like it's \"her way or the highway.\"  I can't believe this is the first time she's shown her true colors though.", "NTA", "NTA.

It's not nothing and it's not a reasonable expectation. If it was an acquaintance, sure.

I'd assess if this codependency and passive aggressiveness is part of a bigger pattern.", ">choosing my friends friends wedding over her\n\nNope. No no no.\n\nYou are not choosing between your girlfriend and your friend. You are choosing to support your very good friend of many years to celebrate his marriage instead of being a plus one at someone else's wedding where the only relevant person to you is the MOH, who will be very busy with her job as MOH that day.

She puts more importance on her relationships with her friends and family than yours with your friends and family. And I don\u2019t think that is good trait.

People like your gf over time end up phasing out your personal relationships, since the expectation would be to chose her friends and family. \n\nBut this is only one situation that you shared, so definitely reflect on the past two years and how you have spent major events.", "NTA, maybe you will meet a new GF at your friends wedding", "NTA   you have friends, she has friends   sometimes, you might think this is weird, things are planned on the same day at different locations. \n\nAsk her why she is going to the other wedding and not going with you.. and see where that conversation leads, it'll be interesting.  post back here with the details", "NTA stick by your friend.
