Sounds like the typical insecure \"we go everywhere together\" mentality.", "NTA You are not choosing your friend's wedding over her. You are choosing your friend's wedding over her friend's wedding, as is natural. Your gf comes off as self-involved. Does she not see that you also have a right to friends?", "NTA\n\nThe conflict is unfortunate. Each attending your respective friend's wedding seems like the best way to handle it. She's welcome to be disappointed but the guilt trip needs to stop.", "NTA at all dude. You each have friends getting married the same day. Why wouldn\u2019t you go to your respective friend\u2019s wedding?\n\nThe issue of you needing to be there because she is the MOH is ridiculous. Being a MOH is about her being there for the bride, not you being there for the MOH. I\u2019m willing to bet that at her friend\u2019s wedding you will know three people: your GF, the bride, and the groom. So, who are you supposed to hang out with while your GF is off doing her MOH duties? She will be preoccupied with being there for the bride and you\u2019ll be chilling at the bar putting out the vibe. \n\nSeveral years ago, I was a groomsman for a friend of mine. The wedding was out of state and my wife didn\u2019t go because we just recently had a baby and the pediatrician advised against flying with our baby if we could help it until she was 3 months old. So, I went to the wedding by myself. I missed my wife and baby for the weekend, but them not being there allowed me to focus all my attention on the groom. I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my wife and baby were having fun. \n\nThat is how I would approach this with your GF. By you not going to her friend\u2019s wedding, she can focus all of her attention on the bride. She won\u2019t have to worry about whether you\u2019re having fun at a wedding where you know no one else.", "NTA - And honestly, stick to your decision.  She will be VERY VERY busy the entire day--up thru *at least* after dinner.   You'd just be tagging along to be there in her short down times between pictures, set ups, etc.  until later in the evening.   That is where she'll be bummed; the slow dances, etc... You will definitely regret missing a good friends wedding - if covid taught us anything - it's that nothing is guaranteed.", "NTA, any normal person would completely understand why you would want to go to your friends wedding over what is basically just acquaintance. Your gf is being pouty and unreasonable and is showing her true colors to how she handles not getting her way.", "NTA things like this happen.

Generally you would like to go to weddings together, but sometimes scheduling doesn\u2019t work out. Both of you should go to your own friend\u2019s weddings and text during. Maybe come up with some sort of game/bingo to feel connected while at separate weddings.", "NTA - from experience, the partner of the maid of honour is going to be sitting alone, entertaining himself\u2026 if you don\u2019t know anyone else in attendance then it\u2019s not going to be awesome for you! She should 100% respect your decision!! And you will both have the best days celebrating your people!", "NTA.\n\nYou want to go to your friend's wedding, that's fine\n\nShe wants to go to her friends wedding, that's fine.\n\nShe expects you to go to her friend's wedding, but I predict she would decline to go your friend's wedding if asked?", "NTA\n\nYour gf can be sad you're not going with her, but she should get over that and support you as you've supported her.\n\nShe should not be trying to also make you feel bad for it or guilt tripping you.

It's only *her* friends that are important.

It can be  boring and lonely", "NTA -- the maid of honor isn't the bride and she is there to support her really good friend. Since, you have essentially the same scenario... I don't see how you can be the AH. Assume you aren't in the other wedding party because for some reasonable explanation?

You both want to attend the wedding for meaningful reasons. It only makes sense for you each to attend your special event.", "This literally happened to me and my fianc\u00e9. I was in my besties wedding and he had a close friends wedding. We went separately to our weddings.

NTA", "NTA \n\nIs your girlfriend is under the delusion that it\u2019s HER wedding? Because being a maid of honor is not a milestone by which you determine your value to someone based on whether they show up for you. \n\nTell her you need to be at your friend\u2019s wedding just like she needs to be at her friend\u2019s wedding. This is such a nonissue.", "NTA. Support your friend! Sometimes weddings fall on the same day and it's ok for you and your SO to go to different weddings.", "NTA there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t support your good friend just like she is supporting her good friend. Plus you would be spending lots of time alone during the wedding and reception if you were to go with your gf as she is fulfilling her MOH duties.", "NTA\n\nThis is more about personal boundaries than anything. \n\nShe may not realise it but the fact she is demanding you be present for her, even though her focus will be on being present for her friend, implies that she is emotionally unable to function in the world without you.\n\nIt makes me question her motivation for her attempts at manipulating you so strongly. Why does she need you there? Is she physically/emotionally/mentally disabled in some way that she feels she needs your presence to be able to cope with the demands of being in a bridal party?\n\nOr is this about controlling you, forcing you to become an extension of her and her wants rather than allowing you to have interests, friends and desires or needs independently of her?\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners would go and attend their respective friends\u2019 weddings and keep connected with a few pics and \u2018I love you/miss you\u2019 texts. \n\nIt really is not about you being TA at all, it\u2019s about your gf emotionally manipulating you into believing you have to do things her way. Only you will know whether this behaviour is warranted or not as you are in the better position to understand her insecurities. \n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not a healthy dynamic.", " NTA. Why should you consider her friend more important than your friend?", "Nta.

Go to the wedding that means something to you. If you and your gf work out, there will be more you can go to together.", "YNTA.

She\u2019s being really selfish as well, considering the reason.\n\nIt\u2019s great to be supportive of your girlfriend\u2026 but she also needs to realize you had a life before you met her and you have your own friends\u2026 and will continue to have your own friends and life outside of her.

It's not nothing and it's not a reasonable expectation. If it was an acquaintance, sure.

No no no.\n\nYou are not choosing between your girlfriend and your friend. You are choosing to support your very good friend of many years to celebrate his marriage instead of being a plus one at someone else's wedding where the only relevant person to you is the MOH, who will be very busy with her job as MOH that day.
