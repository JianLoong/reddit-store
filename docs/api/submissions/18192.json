That type of negativity shouldn\u2019t be around a kid her age, as well gathering all text messages exchanged between your sister & you before & after the wedding, then for one last time explain why you confronted her on, it might of been inappropriate (I don\u2019t think it was) at the time, you were falsely told no children were allowed, you were not given the choice to decline to not go, whether it was wrong or not, your sister lied to you and personally singled out your kid for some reason, regardless of the reason or it not being a big deal to her\u2026what she did was flat out shitty.\n\n\nIt may not be a big deal to her but then again she\u2019s not the one who has to explain to a 12 year old why all her cousins got invited & she didn\u2019t, she\u2019s not the one whose kid that got singled out, if she honestly can\u2019t see how wrong what she did then there is no point in keeping her in your lives, you will not apologize for standing up for your child against an adult who clearly has beef with her, if anyone else agrees with her that you still owe an apology, then they can join her on the no contact list until she turns 18 and legally decide for herself if she wants contact.\n\n\nHowever at this time, no contact between them will be made, at this time your kid needs you to stand beside against bullies, even if the bully is family.", "INFO: You must have a guess, OP.

The girls were 9 and 11 at the time. \n\nMy sister is not very subtle, and made comments about it being a long walk from the cars to the wedding (it really wasnt) and other comments which made me respond by saying my kid(s) arent props for your wedding, so its either both girls or dont worry about it. \n\nSo she said, OK both girls can be in it. \n\nNo problems - and they were so excited when I told them! \n\nThen it started. \n\nSo, oldest daughter (I'll call her (11) from now on, and youngest is (9)) gets to ride in the bridal car but (9) cant. \n\n(11) has hair and make-up done professionally with the rest of bridal party, but (9) doesnt. \n\n(11) sits at the bridal table during reception and (9) doesnt. \n\n(11) gets called up and everyone applauds at reception, but (9) doesnt.

I can't even imagine how this is gunna mess up the daughter when she definitely finds out.", "honestly it doesn't matter if that was the reason it not....\n\nif all the other cousins were invited and present, she'll feel signalled out. And she'll likely think that might be the reason.\n\nedit: want to clarify that it's horrid if it was the reason, but if it's some other reason they were really stupid not to tell OP why, because kids aren't ignorant and OPs daughter will be hurt either way", "Omg, your poor daughter, of course like all girls of her age they start looking at their faces and body and comparing them to what they see as perfect. Your daughter will face a lot of ignorance in her life from others but she should not face it from family. Look up Ellen Keane, an amazing girl and swimmer, she is Irish and has one arm and nothing stops her, she's amazing beautiful and very  inspirational. \nYour sister is vile and any family that supports what she did to your daughter I'd go NC with them as well.", "NTA- I would have blown up infront of everyone there !

I hope everyone in your family sees her for what she is\u2026\u2026", "If this is your sister's true reason then she is beyond despicable and I would have no hesitation in never subjecting your beautiful daughter to her cruelty again - time to go no contact with sister and any family members who take her side.", "Please don\u2019t ever talk to your sister again and ANYONE ELSE WHO TELLS YOU IT\u2019S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.", "You could add this to the original post because it makes you very obviously NTA.", "Oh **_hellllllll_** no, OP.\n\n1- NTA\n2- like others have suggested: go scorched earth on her ass. Channel Beyonc\u00e9 in the Lemonade video.\n\nETA: INFO: how is it blowing up in your family? Are people taking sides? Telling your sister how much of an asshole she is?", "I am very sorry for what has happened to your daughter. Your sister is definetely in the wrong and deserved to be called out in public. \n\nNTA, 100%", "So you'll only be the asshole if you don't show your daughter how to handle ableist people in her life: by eliminating them from your social circle immediately and with great prejudice. Otherwise she will learn to shoulder discrimination to keep the peace, and she's already been through enough in her life.", "NTA. Your sister intentionally left your DISABLED daughter out, that\u2019s outright ableism and that makes her the AH. I think you should add this info and the ages of the other kids to the OP, that\u2019s extremely important information. Your poor daughter is bound to find out from her cousins that she was excluded and that\u2019s going to hurt but at least she\u2019ll know she has a dad who sticks up for her.", "I would have taken my gift and leave the moment I've seen the other kids. Your daughter doesn't deserve such a treatment \nHoly wtf and nta. Never was or ever be", "OP: Your self control is exemplary. People are focussed on how Ella will react, but you have been badly mistreated by Tracy too. Remaining calm is a credit to to you.\n\nI'm so sorry about your wife, and the way this forces attention to a traumatic incident. I'm sorry it forces you to think about the circumstances of Ella's injury, and the trials she will face dealing with the amputation. All of that hits you too, totally undeserved. My sincere sympathy and best wishes.", "You didnt mention in the original post your daughters arm was amputated after a car accdient. I'd have stood up grabbed the mic and told everyone - and its not too late - she deserves to be judged, she deserves her friends and colleagues know who she really is.", "The kids arm was amputated after an accident that killed her mom. That\u2019s why the bride excluded this child.", "Then yes, \ud83d\udcaf, his sister sucks.", "What? Op didn't put that in the post", "> What feelings was she sparing?\n\n\"I think you're daughter's ugly\" vs \"We're not having kids at the wedding\". The bride chose the latter to spare the sister's feelings. Obviously she didn't think things through, but the intention of the lie is clearly to avoid the truth.\n\n> How do you think the niece is gonna feel when she finds out her younger cousins were invited and not her?\n\nWhy would she find out? She's 12. If the OP doesn't tell her, it's hardly going to come up in conversation.\n\n> Edit: this comment is ridiculous. it\u2019s their wedding yes, but it\u2019s quite noticeable that they didn\u2019t invite OP\u2019s daughter because of her amputation.\n\nI already said that this makes the bride an asshole. But the OP is *also* an asshole for taking a big dump on the bride and groom's day.\n\n> Bloody hell, since when was aesthetics more important than anything.\n\nSince when is confronting a bride on their wedding day important? The OP could have waited a day, a week, a month before she confronted her sister. Doing it in the middle of the wedding day is selfish, and therefore makes her an asshole.", "Lol, what did sis think was gonna happen if bro came to the wedding and saw all the other kids there???", "It wouldn\u2019t matter at that point. All she cared about was that she would have successfully kept her disabled niece from the wedding.", "makes me wonder if any of the other guests noticed Ella's absence, but not other children around similar ages. If Tracey is known to be full of herself and shallow, maybe they could put two and two together. Tracey didn't deserve to be approached about the matter in private, she deserved a spectacle in front of all the guests! Poor Ella, she doesn't deserve an auntie as mean as that, nobody does", "Can we also add in this little girl lost her mum.\nThe poor girl. That is so much to go through at such a young age.", "Okay. That totally changes things. Yeah. That's the sister being the asshole here.", "She decided appearances are more important than family. They should all cut her off.", "I see what you did there. It was definitely a reach but I see it.", "I'm so sorry!  \n\nWhen my aunt got married, my oldest uncle wasn't allowed to be in the photographs (her husband forbade it) because he was a half sibling.

And your brother let her get away with it\u2026 hope your brother atleast apologized to you.. some people are just awful.", "One day during a big family meal my grand-father said that he found some stuff about our ancestors and showed us \"our\" family crest. I was like maybe 10/12 and was excited, and told that I was happy/proud to know that we have that. My uncle told me that in fact, it was not really mine because I'm from really from this family. \nI'm 100% his biological niece, we just don't share the same family name as I have my father's. I still old a huge grudge against him, almost twenty years later.", "Singling out one child because she has an amputated arm from a car accident doubles the NTA and he and his daughter better go no contact with the hateful sister for life.", "I was 10 with a single mother, and her friend was getting married. They made an exception for me to attend the ceremony, but get picked up before the reception because my aunt and uncle couldn't babysit me earlier and I was a friend of the bride too (I also crash her bachelorette that my mum hosted for 5mins while they made me in to a toilet paper flower girl for a toilet paper bride before going back to bed).\n\nI am also holding a grudge (couple actually) going on 20years now because my aunt used me as a trophy in a family argument after my mum died, (her kids also did a couple of things I will never forgive/forget) so yeah, kids can definitely hold grudges for any slight against them and if the daughter ever finds out it was because she is an amputee (per OPs comment) well, that sister had better watch out cause young pubescent girls never forget those who wrong them.", "When I got married husband had cousins he was close to (age range 9-18) so they were invited. There were cousins in the same family to whom he wasn\u2019t as close, ages 11, 9 and 2. We invited the older two because we didn\u2019t want to exclude them but the 2-year-old wasn\u2019t invited. Because he was 2. There were 1- and 2-year-olds on my side of the family who also weren\u2019t invited.\n\nMy side didn\u2019t complain and even declared they would never bring their young kids to a wedding, but the parents on DH\u2019s side were awful. Refused to RSVP and tried to push us into letting 2-year-old come. They never asked us about sitters (wedding was out of state), which we would have tried to help with.\n\nThe ridiculous part is that family never invited any kids, even older ones, to any of their weddings.", "Everyone always assumes that these posts about children are written by the mom.
