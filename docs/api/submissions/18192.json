I also hope your kids doing okay.", "And given sister\u2019s follow up it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if she just denied there were kids there if OP has waited to bring it up. Best to do it with the evidence in plain sight. \n\nOP\u2019s sister *knew* that OP would find out. Her plan essentially guaranteed this exact sequence of events would unfold. So if she wants an apology for it happening at the wedding, she can apologize in the mirror.", "He explained that now but in his post he only said \u201colder\u201d. If someone says they\u2019re older, it\u2019s a safe assumptions that indeed they are older than OP\u2019s kid. I\u2019m not exactly the only one thinking older meant indeed older\u2026 He should have put that in his post because it\u2019s quite vital information.", "OP mentions in another comment that her daughter had her arm amputated after being in an accident. If this is the reason her daughter was excluded , clearly NTA.", "In the comments he specified they were as young as 10. By \"older\" he meant \"not little.\"", "OP clarified in a comment that the age cut off seemed to be around 7 and her brother's 10 year old was invited.", "The post makes it seem that way, but I think OP just meant older as in not small children. In some of the comments he said that their were kids younger than his daughter there, and he felt like the cutoff was closer to six. So when he said there were older kids there I think he meant older than that.", "There was a 10 year old there", "Older as in not babies and toddlers; not older than his daughter. OP has specified that the real cut-off age was 6/7 and there were plenty 10-year-olds present. Please don\u2019t spread misinformation.", "*he", "She has an amputated arm apparently, which is the reason for the aesthetics comment", "Her behavioural issue is that she's missing an arm. OP started in his comment that his late wife and his daughter were in an accident.", "\"My daughter's arm was amputated, when she and my late wife were in an accident. Tracy didn't say it directly but I could tell this is highly likely the reason why, so that's why I said she cares more about aesthetics than people\"\nThe OP has mentioned this in his other comments.", "OP said in another comment that Ella had her arm amputated after the car wreck that also killed her mother. That's what the \"aesthetics\" comment was.", "I mean, it could be because the sister cares about aesthetics more than people and the daughter lost her arm in an accident", "\"My daughter's arm was amputated, when she and my late wife were in an accident.

I honestly hope this was not the reason why she wasn't invited.", "Oh, fuck no.", "She did so in some comments I have not seen I suppose.\nAt this point I'd say if she didn't want her nice at her wedding there might be some behavioural issue at play. IMHO the sister should have clearly stated her reason, even though that might have meant having OP not coming to her wedding.", "Good catch, edited", "Oof. That changes things. NTA and a big fat WTF?"]}
