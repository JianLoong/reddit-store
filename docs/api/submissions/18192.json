That type of negativity shouldn\u2019t be around a kid her age, as well gathering all text messages exchanged between your sister & you before & after the wedding, then for one last time explain why you confronted her on, it might of been inappropriate (I don\u2019t think it was) at the time, you were falsely told no children were allowed, you were not given the choice to decline to not go, whether it was wrong or not, your sister lied to you and personally singled out your kid for some reason, regardless of the reason or it not being a big deal to her\u2026what she did was flat out shitty.\n\n\nIt may not be a big deal to her but then again she\u2019s not the one who has to explain to a 12 year old why all her cousins got invited & she didn\u2019t, she\u2019s not the one whose kid that got singled out, if she honestly can\u2019t see how wrong what she did then there is no point in keeping her in your lives, you will not apologize for standing up for your child against an adult who clearly has beef with her, if anyone else agrees with her that you still owe an apology, then they can join her on the no contact list until she turns 18 and legally decide for herself if she wants contact.\n\n\nHowever at this time, no contact between them will be made, at this time your kid needs you to stand beside against bullies, even if the bully is family.", "INFO: You must have a guess, OP.

I was told it was a child-free wedding. She had her recital a few hours before the wedding so when we showed up I realized her sisters, aunts and other friends had their kids (mostly adolescents but there were also two infants and a toddler). \n\nIt hurt obviously because I didn\u2019t get to take my daughter but it\u2019s her wedding and she paid for it so she gets to dictate what happens but i just wish she had been fair and didn\u2019t exclude my kid.", "Yeah. That's diabolical. It'll be bad enough if she had made the wedding childfree just to avoid seeing OP's daughter. But to come up with a scheme like this...my god. That's awful. Not only if she ableist and a bunch of other things, she's also a liar.", "I'd also send an email to every guest of hers I know her reasons for excluding the daughter. Then ask them to forward it to any guests they know.", "If it makes you feel any better, it probably wasn't his crest either. Family crests go to the first son only, other branches get their own. It's not just having the same last name.", "I really hope no one else in OP's family holds the same ways about her amputation.....", "And anyone not on my side, I'd assume is against me,  Ops family is gross.", "Same, I am so protective of my niece and nephew!", "Oh, absolutely OP needs to tell people what his sister did.  For his daughter's sake, he needs to identify anyone who doesn't realize how heinous that is and excise them from their lives.  The poor girl has already been through so much, and is going to be retraumatized when she hears about the wedding.  Time to clean house in the support network.", "A lot of amputees get excluded from parties or gatherings for looking \"weird\" or \"wrong\". I've definitely heard the argument that \"children are here you'll scare them\"\n\nWhich is obviously super gross and just wrong?? Like as a kid I thought it was super cool that someone was able to loose a whole ass body part and *still* live life to the fullest. Maybe that's just because of Terry Fox being a national hero so Canadians are just accustomed to disabled people not being that much different to abled people", "I'd put her on blast on Facebook, too. Because the family may be deranged, but the community is gonna set everybody straight on this one.", "There is no way I\u2019d ever let my child ( your aunt ) do this to my grandchildren\u2026 at my house. Grandparents totally hold a lot of blame here it\u2019d tell her to leave first.", "can you pick me up on the way, I also wanna \"talk\". I am roughly 8000 miles away!", "Oh shit I'd disown my sister for that, full no contact.", "Oh my God!! That's awful...what an absolute shit thing to do to a young girl.\nI'd never speak to her again!", "I honestly figured she was overweight or something since he texted her about caring more for aesthetics than family. Then I saw the comment about the arm..", "You can definitely tell who the Golden child is. \nIf OPs family picks the sister's \"side\" after what her and her husband pulled, 1) you know where she got it from and 2) good fucking riddance.", "Yup I missed that bit. Edited to change gender. THANK YOU", "Hell my niece and nephew are on my husband's side and I love those kids dearly!! Never would have thought to exclude them!", "I just think the best approach is not to go in guns blazing, but to give that polite and reasonable request to ask her what she'd like her niece to be told by way of explanation, now it's quite clear it was NOT a child free wedding? Heck, he could even lay it on about how he knows it was hard for her to miss out on being at her auntie's wedding, but how mature she was in accepting that her dad would be going while she didn't. And of course how he doesn't want to make anything up so please give him the explanation to pass on for why she wasn't invited while younger children were.", "I wanna get that little girl one of those robot arms and teach her how to flip off auntie dearest in every culture.", "I've put some of my grudges through grad school and I'm prepared to raise strong and healthy grudges over this issue as well. I'm always prepared to die on others hills if I like the view. And this one has me particularly enraged.", "I honestly don't get that behaviour. I don't understand people being so self absorbed that they think its fine to alienate a 12year old amputee, who just lost their mother, all because she might 'ruin the aesthetic' . People like OPs sister just suck and should be publicly shamed for their pathetic, attention seeking, narcissistic behaviour. \n\nMaybe we need a modern equivalent of the pillory/stocks", "A very good friend of mine recently got married. For six years, I was there for her when she had boyfriend problems, work problems, deaths in the family. \n\nI was not invited because I was in a wheelchair and am paralyzed. She wanted people who would be on the dance floor and bringing high energy, not someone who would just sit on the sidelines. Also, it would mess with the *aesthetics* of the pictures. It\u2019s hard to fit cripples in the frame. \n\nI hope all the elderly relatives were up dancing all night! \n\nWe\u2019re still friends. I\u2019m just not her agony aunt anymore. She has problems, she can talk them over with her husband.", "If anyone deserved their wedding to be absolutely ruined, it\u2019s this lady\u2019s.", "Actually OP is her father.", "Translation mistake. In German kids are \"it\" (Das Kind und es). I corrected it.", "That's really awful. To not even be invited to the wedding? Wow. I've been to weddings and I've had one myself. Not everybody is on the dance floor, bringing high energy. As for wedding pictures, give me a break. The ones that go on frames are bride & groom, the rest are in some photo album (or in the cloud these days). \n\n>We\u2019re still friends.\n\nYou must be a saint.", "If that was the reason the sister excluded her it is very much relevant.", "I'd be petty and write an apology on her socials all like \"soz that my daughter's amputated arm didn't go along with aesthetics of your wedding! Lose my number and don't approach my family! Bye\"\n\nThen let the drama unfold", "Thank you, fixed.", "Nah. Nowhere near a saint. I\u2019m just not salty. Saved myself buying an expensive dress, buying my husband a new suit, an overnight trip and a big wedding gift. \n\nI sent her a lovely card to congratulate her and nothing else. She already owned a home and had everything she needed. She and her now husband work in very lucrative fields so they don\u2019t need money. She always said, \u201cDon\u2019t buy me anything, I don\u2019t need it\u201d when it came to holidays and birthdays. So I\u2019m just gonna guess that means weddings, too. \n\nThat\u2019s what will get under her skin. That lack of a gift will stick in her memory and make a nice little home there. She can be quite materialistic and bases status off of possessions. \n\nPetty? Absolutely. But if you don\u2019t have the guts to tell me before the wedding I talked/listened to you about endlessly that I\u2019m not invited, you deserve petty. \ud83d\ude00", "She turned me into a newt!"]}
