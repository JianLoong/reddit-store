{"id": 1146, "submission_id": "ylwssu", "title": "AITAH for yelling at my partner?", "selftext": "Editing for clarification: I visited my partner in their town. Went great. Got invited to an event at their friends house. We show up to friends house. I\u2019m not entirely included in the conversations and my toddler starts fussing hardcore. Partner puts us in friends spare bedroom and leaves us there. Toddler doesn\u2019t nap but dinner is ready so we come out of room. Partners best friend is there, didn\u2019t know they would be. I found out earlier they knew about the miscarriage and it was weird for me knowing they knew and the way they were looking at me. Friend makes snide comment but oh well. Partner ignores me entirely for the rest of the time I\u2019m there. Once kids are fed I put them into the car, I\u2019m crying while doing so. Partner comes out of friends house and sees me crying. They don\u2019t do anything besides pat my shoulder and say bye. I get home and they call. I get upset and yell at them over what they did. Saying they could\u2019ve taken five minutes to help me calm down, included me in any of the conversations, and not ditched me at this event. They said they didn\u2019t wanna be inconsiderate to their friends by staying and making sure I was okay. I was overreacting and didn\u2019t need to be upset at all. \n\nFor context this person is usually incredibly kind and makes me feel safe. This is the first negative interaction I\u2019ve ever had with them. I had gone to visit them (it\u2019s about a 2 hour drive) and everything was going great. They asked me if I wanted to go with them to an event at a friends place and I said sure. I have two small children, toddlers. My oldest hadn\u2019t napped and was super fussy. I was offered the spare bedroom to try to put him down for a nap (which he refused) and my partner just kinda left me to that. I gave up on toddler napping and just decided that we\u2019d eat and go home, not stay for the actual event. I didn\u2019t know this at the time but my partners best friend was going to be at this event. I just went through a miscarriage and hadn\u2019t told anyone. I was keeping it to myself as I hadn\u2019t announced I was pregnant. I found out yesterday that my partner had told this person. So when I met them they had that \u201coh you poor thing\u201d about them. The best friend also made a comment about me not knowing about a keurig (never been around one) of \u201coh how could you\u201d in a condescending tone. My partner kinda ditched me the rest of the time and hung out with their friend. I have a horrible time with unfamiliar places and people. I was a wreck by the time I loaded my toddlers into the car. My partner just kinda said bye and left me to my breakdown while he went back to the event. I dunno am I the asshole for being upset over the whole thing and yelling at him about it?", "created_utc": 1667562275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylwssu/aitah_for_yelling_at_my_partner/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not surprised your partner told their best friend.  Bff's should be trusted with sensitive info, or they shouldnt be a bff.  You are not the AH.  Because I don't know how your conversations have gone with your partner about the loss and your feeling, I can only say nah.
