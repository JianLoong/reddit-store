My coworker Chris (27m) started working there a few months ago after he was laid off from his last job. It really has sucked for him- He loved that job and after losing it he had to delay his wedding and move back in with his dad. When we hired him, my boss at the time made it clear that he was going to try and promote him first due to the situation, and Chris got his promotion and has been working as a shift supervisor for a few months while he looks for a new role.\n\nI get Chris is really bummed about the whole situation, it's very frustrating, but he has a temper. When something sets him off, he tends to blow up a little. Usually it's pretty private, but I've heard him get really short with other people we work with.\n\nLast week, I was closing up shop with him, and a woman came in about 10 minutes before closing. Chris was taking her order and I heard him start ripping into her. She walked out looking like she was about to cry and Chris was sneering. I asked him what that was all about, and then he started yelling at me about how he's \"the manager\" and I \"don't get to tell him what to do.\"\n\nHe stomped back to the office, and I got to work doing some cleaning, when I felt his hand on my shoulder turning me around. He got in my face and said \"You understand me, I'm serious! Don't ever tell me how to do my job!\" I told him firmly that he needed to get his hands off of me or I would call the cops, and immediately he softened up, and the whole rest of our shift he was apologizing and we were talking. He really seemed sincere, but the fact that he put his hand on me crossed a line.\n\nAs soon as I left, I called our general manager and told him what happened. Over the next few days, I noticed Chris was not on the schedule. Yesterday morning, I came in to find out they came very close to firing Chris altogether, but ended up just demoting him to part-time.\n\nWhile what he did wasn't really excusable, I sort of feel like a jerk because of his situation and the fact that he apologized to me.

He deserves to be reported for that kind of behavior. Not only did he get in your face for asking a question, but he was incredibly rude to a customer for no reason. That kind of behavior might have been why he got fired from his last job too.", "NTA.   You didn't get your coworker demoted.  Their inappropriate behavior got them demoted.", "NTA\n\nTo be fair, yelling at a customer to the point she started crying for seemingly no reason (honestly what could she have said to warrant that) is ENOUGH to cut back the hours. Him touching you just put it over the top. I am sure they reviewed the tape or spoke to him before they made their decision. It's not your fault and if he wants to keep a job, he has to be nicer.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how agitated I've ever been, I've never put my hands on ANYONE. ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DIDNT DO SHIT TO HIM. Dude is literally insane acting like that at work, who makes customers cry and then sneers about it? He's a certificated psycho, losing the company money, and probably got fired from his old job for the same thing. Him saying sorry does not mean he means it. It means he sensed from your reaction that you were not the type to just cower at intimidation, and knew he was in hot water. He probably wouldn't do that to you again, but you reporting it is protecting your coworkers from a bad manager. So if anything, you are an anti-asshole.", "NTA - He abused a customer and then committed assault on you.  He's not mature or stable enough for any type of management or supervisory position and frankly your boss should have fired him--he's a major risk.  He needs to grow up and get his anger issues under control.  Frankly, you should have called the cops on him, but I understand why you didn't.  He's reaping the consequences of his own actions so don't let anyone guilt you, especially not him.", "NTA. It sounds like he has had previous complaints before yours for the actions they took. Him yelling at the customer is bad for business, him putting his hands on you is a liability. They would be better off firing him in my opinion. You deserve better treatment, not just from a manager but from the entire company.", "NTA.  There is no excuse for what he did to you and that customer.  He does not have the temperment for management and most likely any line of work that interacts with the public.", "NTA\n\nHis behavior needed to be reported.", "Nope. NTA. A 27 yr old should have learned by now how to manage his temper and his attitude with customers and coworkers. He went and proved he isn't management material, and nearly not employee material. Its on him. He needs to get his act together or he will live with daddy forever. Putting hands on a coworker is a big no.", "NTA, his behavior was not acceptable. Be it towards you or the customers. It isn't in the manager's or your interest to go out of business, so it was necessary. Actions have consequences.", "NTA - You did the right thing by making the manager aware of the situation. Any consequences that resulted from that are absolutely not your fault. The only one at fault is Chris.\n\nWe all have hard days, but the way he behaved was absolutely not appropriate and deserved to be raised with management. Hopefully, Chris takes this as a lesson learnt and can be a better employee moving forward.", "NTA. You likely prevented something equally bad or even worse from happening down the line.", "100% NTA. His actions were completely uncalled for.", "NTA. He should suffer the consequences of his absolutely unacceptable behavior.", "No you did not go too far.  He did.  Good thing they handled it quickly.  NTA at all.", "NTA. This kind of shit is probably the reason Chris was \"laid off\" in the first place.", "NTA. You didn't go far enough. Pepper spray him next time. He can't keep a job because he can't manage his emotions. There will be a next time.", "Nta\n\nHis problems affect his performance and he causes problems for those around him.", "NTA\n\nHe was not manager/supervisor material. You don't yell at customers (who likely complained), nor do you put hands on coworkers.", "NTA- you did him a favor. This is likely not the first time his temper has cost him an opportunity. \n\nYoung men need to be held accountable. It is how they learn.", "NTA. Life is dealing with problems, don't you have yours? His situation is not that terrible, is just how life works -sometimes you are up, others down-so yeah there is no excuse to he a complete AH with you and the costumer.", "NTA. You did not cost him his job- he did with his own actions and behaviors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact, there may have been other complaints that you don't know about.", "NTA.  If you didn't report him and he got away with that behavior then he'd just keep doing it to somebody else, and that would be partially due to your non-action.", "NTA.  It is pretty obvious why he lost his last job.  Everything he did was inappropriate from yelling at a customer, to yelling at employees, to yelling at you, to putting a hands on you.  Good job standing up for yourself and telling him to get his hands off you or you would call the police.", ">\tmy boss at the time made it clear that he was going to try and promote him first due to the situation, and Chris got his promotion\n\n**Chris got promoted because he was going to have a wife to support?**. \n\nChris got the promotion simply because he was male.  That\u2019s discrimination based on sex, which is illegal.\n\nChris was aggressive with customers, and threatening to employees. Someone needs to fire your boss for exposing the company to a bunch of legal issues. Then they need to fire Chris for his horrible behavior. \n\nYou are NTA. You would not be out of line if you had a quiet word with the franchise owner about all this.

I'm in college right now, but after that happened I really don't want to work here anymore.", "That's a little much have you ever experienced pepper spray?", "Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and bet that Chris was fired from his last job for doing exactly what he was doing at this job (i.e. being mean to customers, having a short temper, and putting his hands on other people).

I do think it was in poor taste to promote this guy so quickly because they felt sorry for him as well. That screams favoritism to me. Clearly they bet on the wrong horse. You are certainly better off somewhere else.", "Yes, which is why I suggested it.", "Sorry, that's still a little much, what if the guy has some kind of health issue that the pepper spray aggravated and sends the guy to the hospital. He could probably be charged. The response should be equal to the action in the first place. Now if he did more then put his hand on his shoulder and got physical then pepper spray the piss out of him.", "But he's a man! A manager! So strong...I'm sure a little pepper spray is nothing for a gleaming specimen like him.\nSeriously op. Kick him in the avocados", "I think it's  \"a little much\" to yell and lay hands on people.
