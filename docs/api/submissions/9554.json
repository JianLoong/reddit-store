Chris was taking her order and I heard him start ripping into her. She walked out looking like she was about to cry and Chris was sneering.

He got in my face and said \"You understand me, I'm serious!

Their inappropriate behavior got them demoted.", "NTA\n\nTo be fair, yelling at a customer to the point she started crying for seemingly no reason (honestly what could she have said to warrant that) is ENOUGH to cut back the hours.

It's not your fault and if he wants to keep a job, he has to be nicer.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how agitated I've ever been, I've never put my hands on ANYONE. ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DIDNT DO SHIT TO HIM. Dude is literally insane acting like that at work, who makes customers cry and then sneers about it? He's a certificated psycho, losing the company money, and probably got fired from his old job for the same thing. Him saying sorry does not mean he means it. It means he sensed from your reaction that you were not the type to just cower at intimidation, and knew he was in hot water. He probably wouldn't do that to you again, but you reporting it is protecting your coworkers from a bad manager. So if anything, you are an anti-asshole.", "NTA - He abused a customer and then committed assault on you.  He's not mature or stable enough for any type of management or supervisory position and frankly your boss should have fired him--he's a major risk.

He's reaping the consequences of his own actions so don't let anyone guilt you, especially not him.", "NTA. It sounds like he has had previous complaints before yours for the actions they took. Him yelling at the customer is bad for business, him putting his hands on you is a liability. They would be better off firing him in my opinion.

Any consequences that resulted from that are absolutely not your fault.

I Can see demoting him for the way he behaved towards the customer as, it seems, that was his first incident. However, not firing him after he assaulted someone, and a woman at that, should have gotten him fired. \n\nI agree with you that they care more about customer service and it sucks. She shouldn\u2019t have to work for a company that lets an abuser stay on staff.", "I think I'm paraphrasing Steve Harvey when I say the term snitching should be reserved for people who tell on others when they themselves were also involved in the crime. If you did something stupid all by yourself, I'm not under any obligation to keep your secret.", "Yeah that part of the story also really bothered me. I could see if he came from a related job and had more experience in the customer service field, but promoting him over other employees just because he's in a tough financial spot? Not a company I would want to stay with.", "This is also very true.", "100% agree.

Myself I would have probably knocked his hand off me, stepped back if possible and told him to not ever to touch me again. I would not have pepper sprayed him at that point. Though I had a rather rough upbringing so getting physical with someone is not that big of problem to me if he decided to escalate things. Not knowing you and your life's experiences it may have been a rather scary thing for you and possibly pepper spray would be an option if he pushed things further. I don't think it is an option for someone who grabbed me and turned me around. If you ever have been pepper sprayed in the face let me tell you it is extremely painful.\n\nI imagine your whole work area would have had to have been thoroughly cleaned. and if food thrown away.

I know a lot of waiters and restaurant staff are going to hate this, but if closing time is 9:00 pm and someone walks in at 8:59 pm they should be sat and treated like any other customer.
