She 43 had two children from a previous relationship.  She was receiving child support from her ex and we only married after she stopped getting alimony. \n\nHer kids were part of my life from ages 10/12 - 14/16. We were on good terms but they had a father and they were on good terms with him.  As it should be. They were civil and well behaved when they spent time with us.  \n\nI've never had kids and didn't ever plan on kids. So it was a new experience for me. It was interesting but I was happy that I dealt with them when they were already partly grown.  \n\nMy relationship in with their mom did last, unfortunately. It might have been better if we hadn't gone from having fairly independent lives for our first year of marriage to being locked into our house together 24/7 for the next two years. We divorced two years ago.  \n\nWe were older when we met and we both had careers so we had a prenup. I kept my house that I owned before we married and she got some money from the retirement fund we set up.  \n\nWe are from a small town outside a big city. So we saw each other every once in a while.  At the grocery store or at social events. \n\nThe older kid is starting college this September. I remember helping them plan out their high school AP classes and talking about getting them a car if they wanted to drive in from town to a train station for school.  \n\nIt never happened.  I never got them a car.  \n\nNow they are starting college and I saw her and she asked if I was still planning on helping her out.  I said no. My help was kind of contingent on me being in a relationship with their mom.  She got upset and said that the help she got from her father was independent from his relationship with her mom.  I did not want to have this conversation, or explain to an 18 year old girl exactly why I wasn't willing to drop a few thousand dollars on a kid I had no real connection to.  I had only seen her six or seven times since the divorce.  \n\nMy ex called me up and said I was an asshole for going back on a promise to her daughter. I couldn't believe I had to explain to her why I didn't owe her kid anything.  \n\nAITA?.", "created_utc": 1677700119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ff7vc/aita_for_not_helping_my_ex_stepkids_out/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both the ex and her daughter sound incredibly entitled. OF COURSE the help she got from her father was independent of his relationship with her mom -  HE IS HER FATHER! You are not. It's not even the same and if she is smart enough to have taken AP courses then she's smart enough to know that statement- and her entire request- was full of shit.  Your ex is also full of it. I'm guessing she had not brought it up to you anytime prior to this.", "NTA. And good of you that you DIDN'T explain to the 18-year old the difference between her real dad and an ex-husband of her mom for a few years. That would have hurt.\n\nIn an ideal world, perhaps, you would keep the promise once made irrespective of everything else but we do not live in an ideal world, and what you did is understandable. THe girl is just 18, and it is forgivable that she perceived it as a promise given without considering it was in fact conditional.

Desperate people do desperate things.", "The father in the movie was speaking about step children.", "Even if they did, still not an AH for it. The \"kid\" is 18 and he gave reasonable explanation.
