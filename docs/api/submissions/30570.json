She is now a little over 4 months pregnant. For the last 4 months all I had to listen to is her complaining. Some of her complaints I totally get, like the complaint of morning sickness and fatigue. But as she is starting to grow a little belly she has been non stop complaining about how \"fat\" she looks, and how upsetting it is that her favorite clothes don't fit her. She is pretty thin typically, a 32 inch waist (edit: I should mention she is over 6ft tall), so of course her normal clothes won't fit her as her belly grows. \nI myself have struggled with my weight all my life, and have had issues loosing weight even when going to the gym and eating healthy. So listening to someone constantly complain about their body (that is changing due to their choices, and is a temporary situation) is starting to get to me. The fact that this is her 3rd is also adding to this, because I feel like she knew what to expect. \n\nSo after another message from her complaing about her body, and how \"fat\" she is, I finally had enough. I responded telling her that I don't want to hurt her feelings and that while her feelings are valid (you can't help how you feel), I can not be the one listening to her Fat- shame herself anymore. Especially since she isn't fat, but pregnant. \n\nNow she is no longer talking to me. I genuinely understand that her feelings are valid and she can't help how she feels about herself right now.

You were supportive and kind in the way you approached it, and respected her feelings.

You actually can affect the way you feel by engaging with the reasons for the feeling. But more importantly, an absurd feeling isn't valid.

Especially coming from skinny woman. I understand body dismorphia and society fucking up our minds on self image, but please, just stop.

It doesn't make you feel great to hear her body shame herself when you have struggled with your weight so that must be really hard.  You are right, having a 3rd (even though all are different) you know mostly what to expect.  In the 3rd/4th month it is weird because you do have a weird \"fat\" look that isn't the same as a baby belly, but again, you are right, she made the choice and knows it isn't fat.  \n\nIt sounds like if she isn't talking to you when you were kind about this, she wasn't a great friend to you.

She's been pregnant twice before and knows what it does to the body.", "NAH, although I'm leaning soft YTA if I'm being entirely honest. I think that it's fine to get annoyed with your friend constantly complaining about things if that's all they talk about, but I think the fact that her complaints about her weight bother you while her complaints about morning sickness don't is an issue on your end, not hers. She had morning sickness with every other pregnancy, but you seem not to take issue with her complaining about having morning sickness now even though she should have expected it. You only take issue with her complaining about her weight gain, which is again, indicative of an issue with how *you* feel about weight. \n\nYour friend is pregnant, and she's complaining about all the things involved with that, it really seems like there's no AH intentions behind her actions. Just because she's been pregnant before and has gained weight before doesn't mean she should enjoy the experience. It's annoying to gain weight rapidly and not fit into any of your clothes and constantly be uncomfortable. It's not \"fat-shaming\" for her to be annoyed and uncomfortable by the changes her body is going through during this time and express those feelings. It sounds like you don't want to hear about her weight gain/body issues because of your own issues:\n\n>I myself have struggled with my weight all my life, and have had issues loosing weight even when going to the gym and eating healthy. So listening to someone constantly complain about their body (that is changing due to their choices, and is a temporary situation) is starting to get to me. \n\nNone of this invalidates what's happening to your friend. It doesn't matter the change is a choice she made, she's still experiencing the change and it makes her uncomfortable. I get that you don't want to hear her complain about this, but I don't think she's being an AH by complaining about what she's experiencing and I don't know that it really qualifies as \"fat-shaming.\"\n\nWhy I think you could be a slight AH in this situation is that it sounds like you are okay with your friend complaining about her pregnancy, you just don't want to listen to her talk about weight gain. It's fine to tell her you don't want to hear about it if it really bothers you, but I think ultimately this is an issue with you, and not her. \n\nIf someone else talking about weight gain is something you can't stand to hear about, then I think there are some insecurities you need to address on your own. Just telling people not to talk about things that are impacting them because of how it makes you feel isn't exactly fair. You said yourself what she's feeling is valid, while in the same breath you're telling her she can't talk about it with you. You can't always expect other people to censor themselves and their feelings for the sake of your own insecurities. You should address your own issues with weight gain so future conversations about it don't get to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hate how I look.

I didn't even gain that much weight during pregnancy (10-15 lbs) so I was optimistic that maybe it wouldn't be SOOO bad afterwards.  It is so much worse than I ever could have imagined.  I don't know if it was the c section or just the straight up exhaustion, or the fact that I couldn't breastfeed, or my age (mid 40s now) but ugh I really hate how I look, and having done the calorie restriction and food elimination and exercise so many times only to plateau, burn out and fall off the wagon so many times, I really just can't face doing it again.  \n\nI'm extremely jealous of people who have never had to struggle with their weight, and even people who at some point in early adulthood were fit and a normal weight, because I have been overweight since I was a child, so to some extent, I don't even believe it is possible for me to not be fat.

If it doesn't need to be said, and saying it would make my friend feel bad, I'm not saying it. OP isn't saying Preggo can't complain, just not to complain to her.

Tell me if i am wrong, but I am understanding your comment as: I am a slight AH for saying my piece... concluding that I have to censor my insecurities for the sake of hers... but youre saying i shouldn't ask that of her.

And there's days looking in the mirror where those ads start replaying in my mind a little too much. \n\nYou're still NTA, because your friend doesn't get a pass on burdening you with the emotional issues she's facing.

I did IVF to get here, I know exactly what I signed up for. That doesn't mean I can't dislike some of the changes my body has rapidly gone through - especially when they're not only aesthetically but also physically uncomfortable.

Let\u2019s say 9 months of pregnancy plus a year or more afterwards - and the whole time you\u2019re constantly having to change your wardrobe for your changing body every 3-6 months.

An example: When I was injured and couldnt do any sports and gained weight and a friend who knew my struggle was talking about how good he is in sport (when he knows I cannot do it and I was missing doing it).

Even at 6\u20191.", ">Calling yourself fat and talking about how awful it is to be that fat to someone bigger than you is a dick move even if they don't have issues with their weight. \n\nI've been skinny my whole life and struggled with weight gain the last five or so years. One of the biggest challenges of gaining weight was realizing that it's not okay  for people like me to talk about weight. People like you believe that if I'm smaller than you, my feelings on weight don't matter. I'm \"skinny\" if I'm smaller than you, and so it's just not possible for me to feel \"fat\" and uncomfortable in my own body. If I talk about how going up several sizes makes me feel, I'm automatically offending anyone who is a larger size. I'm not capable of understanding how weight gain can make you feel, because I'm smaller than you. \n\nThat's... not even remotely logical. People of a large size don't own weight and body insecurities in general. People of all shapes and sizes may feel uncomfortable about their weight, and they should be allowed to express that regardless of how much other people weigh, or how those people feel about their own weight. OP's friend should be free to talk about her weight gain and how it makes her feel. She's talking about herself and her body. What needs to change is that people like you (and OP), need to stop making someone else's feelings about YOUR body and YOUR weight.\n\nIf OP's friend feels uncomfortable with her weight gain, she shouldn't have to censor herself for the sake of OP just because OP is bigger. I also feel like it's offensive to even suggest she should have to do so automatically, because just because someone is bigger doesn't mean they're insecure about their weight. There are tons of people who are \"bigger\" by whatever standard you want to measure, who don't have insecurities because they've addressed them and are comfortable with their bodies.\n\nThis is all without even touching on the fact that what OP's friend is feeling is probably different than what OP feels. Weight gain when you're pregnant is not like regular weight gain. It can happen rapidly, isn't always an even distribution, and comes with a whole other host of symptoms that make you feel awful. Some people not only gain weight but swell from water retention, and have mobility issues because of how the weight is distributed. OP saying her friend is \"fat-shaming\" for complaining about weight gain while being pregnant is a reach. OP's friend shouldn't be barred from talking about how she feels because OP has issues with how they feel about their own body.", "I think you're fine. Some people are going to empathize with your friend more than they empathize with you and I can tell you through personal experience that the idea that it's rude and triggering to complain to other people about your body when they might be in a body that is less praised by society at large is VERY new. So in some cases, people feel like \"Well, I did this when I was pregnant and I think it was valid. I didn't mean to hurt anyone! It was just about how I was feeling!\"\n\nAnd I feel that -- I do. But it's also something MOST women will find upsetting and hurtful to be on the receiving end of. We've just been conditioned not to say that outloud because we're also told that how our body looks is our \"fault.\" \n\nWhat your friend is going through is something I can sympathize with but it is not MORE valid that you not wanting to hear it because it makes you feel bad.\n\nBeing pregnant is hard -- but this stuff, where someone is very upset about their body and wants to talk about it? That's just as valid to take to a therapist as anything you're feeling. It's objectively true that society values thin bodies over larger bodies, particularly for women. It's understandable that your friend is anxious about what this pregnancy will do for her body. But I can't get around the part where she's leaving you feeling like one of her worst fears would be being in a body that looks more like yours. That's a terrible thing to say to someone and people really need to start realizing that when they complain about things like this, that is the message they are communicating to anyone larger than them.\n\nI  feel like your friend is falling victim to some ugly stuff and that's not her fault -- but not engaging you when you asked her very kindly to miss you on the body complaints is on her. NTA.", "I never said you were invalidating her experience, just that her experience is valid even if she has experienced it before. i.e., you said because she was pregnant before and experienced the weight gain she should have known what to expect. It isn't less obnoxious because she's had it before. It's still uncomfortable. \n\nI think it's fine to tell her you don't want to listen to her complain about her weight. If it triggers, it triggers you. I'm just saying I don't think she is an AH for sharing. She's expressing discomfort about her weight gain for a valid reason, and I don't think it's fat-shaming for her to do so. \n\n>Tell me if i am wrong, but I am understanding your comment as: I am a slight AH for saying my piece... **concluding that I have to censor my insecurities for the sake of hers...**\n\nDo you think when she complains about morning sickness, it's because she's insecure about her morning sickness, or because morning sickness just sucks? It's because morning sickness sucks. I think that you're trying to equate her complaints about weight gain to being an insecurity of hers, when in reality she's probably just complaining about it because it's uncomfortable and doesn't make her feel good. \n\nI don't think that listening to your friend complain really means censoring your own insecurities at all. If she's talking about herself and how she feels, she's talking about her body and her weight. There's no censoring on your part needed, just don't take what she's saying and make it about you and your body. \n\nShe isn't calling you fat or saying it's wrong for anyone to be fat, she's expressing her discomfort with herself and her body. If you can't help but immediately make it about your weight and your body and your insecurities, then I think you need to address that issue on your own. The reality is nothing she is saying is directed at you, but you're becoming uncomfortable with her feelings because of your own issues.\n\nI'm not trying to argue either, I put NAH as the ruling because I see both sides, I just don't know that it's fair to tell someone else they can't express discomfort in their weight gain because of how you feel about your own weight/past issues. I feel like they're not in the wrong for expressing how they feel, and it's not about you, even though I can understand why it might make you uncomfortable. It's just something you have to address within yourself, it's not really something they can fix. Even if they just never talk about it, that insecurity of yours is still going to exist. You have to address it for your own mental health and well being.", "Nothing the preganant friend did was inconsiderate.

She should. So should you. It is very likely to have a negative emotional impact on the person you are speaking with. If you'd like to know more, I suggest you look at writers like Lindy West and Aubrey Gordon who will do a very good job of walking you thorugh the basics of the experience of being overweight and the consistent slings and arrows that people toss, often thoughtlessly. The experiences are not the same -- objectively.\n\nIf you are defending this so hard because you have complained to people who are bigger than you about your weight gain, consider that you may have been insensitive, and it may of hurt them.

My mom has come over for a week to help me catch up on things and already started in on me \"not eating healthy\" and needing to be mindful of what I eat or I'll gain too much weight when she's been here for less than 24 hours. I had to remind her that even though I look bigger, I'm so nauseous that I can't physically eat the number of recommended calories in a day that I should be and am actually losing weight. If all I can stomach are milkshakes and Chick-fil-A nuggets then that's ok because at least it's something. Like I'm pregnant with twins.
