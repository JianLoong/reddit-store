He's been totally freaked out and usually had his hands clamped over his ears every time we sat down to dinner. I felt really bad, his anxiety's terrible and it was beyond just him being annoyed. I've tried a lot of things, from hiccup remedies for Rex and some therapy for Marshall, but it just doesn't seem to be working.\n\nLast week I decided Rex should just eat upstairs. I think he's old enough to not care as much about sitting at the table, plus the hiccups are embarrassing to him so I figured he'd enjoy the privacy. Well my sister is a bigtime busybody, she's always asking my kids all kinds of invasive questions.

Crumpling the diaphragm is not good and can cause spasms (thus, hiccups). Make sure enough water is being consumed throughout the day, again, dehydration = spasms. Limit soda and caffeine, more causes for muscle spasms. Eat larger meals in the morning and smaller meals towards the end of the day, always eating upright and with plenty of water.
