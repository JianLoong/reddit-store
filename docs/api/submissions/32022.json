Growing up, I often felt like I was an afterthought, but I get my parents were just dealing with the cards they were given.\n\nMissy is usually super independent but has started shutting everyone out, kind of like I used to.

We both saved up, and my parents were totally cool with it. So I let them know and my mom asks if Macy could join. I shut that down real quick. Macy's not a fan of trips, especially long ones, and the whole point was for me and Missy to have some quality time.

I also spend time with Macy, the same I do with Missy. We watch movies, read, books, we color, and etc. I definitely will tell them that I am NOT bringing Macy on our trip and is a nonnegotiable and tell them that maybe I could watch her for weekend while they do whatever. I guess  when he said \u201cappreciation\u201d he was referring to going half of my car. I will also tell them that I do not plan to take care of Macy when they get older/ pass way and they need to start looking for somewhere for her to go. Definitely will bring up the years worth of neglect and how sooner or later, they will lose both of their daughters. I really appreciate everyone\u2019s advice in the comments it made me feel less alone. I definitely will be showing them the comments. I\u2019ll also do an update post either after the conversation or after our trip, depending how it goes!

If your parents would like a night alone, then they need to hire someone (qualified to meet Macy's needs) and then have their time alone.  This trip is an opportunity for you and Missy to have time together and get a break from being glass children.  INFO:  Have your parents made arrangements for Macy's care once they are unable to care for her?", "NTA and let them know that.  You felt neglected and you see the same signs in your baby sister.  You are doing their job for them by paying additional attention to Missy.  If they want alone time, they can get a sitter for Macy.  Raising Macy isn't your job.", "NTA. Have your parents shown any concern for Missy? \nYou\u2019re a very sweet sibling. Macy is not your child and it doesn\u2019t seem like something she would enjoy. Your dad is being selfish.\n\nEdit to change \u201csister\u201d to \u201csibling.\u201d I thought OP specified they were F too until a re-read.", "NTA whatsoever. You are 18. Missy is 15. It won't feel like it right now but you are so young. Too young to be shouldered with this type of guilt.\n\nIt sounds like you're extremely emotionally intelligent and picking up on not only 1) how you've been affected by the situation but 2) how your sister might be feeling, even though she hasn't said it, and even though your parents seemingly haven't noticed. I wouldn't second-guess your own judgement here, I reckon you're bang on.\n\nIt also sounds like your parents need a dose of reality but I suspect they're tired. People say and do some weird things when they're over-tired and emotionally exhausted. That said, I really don't like the manipulation of 'it's a way to show your appreciation' \u2013 to pull out a quote my own Mum said to me once \"you didn't ask to be born\".\n\nIf you can I'd stand your ground but be very honest with them about why it's important you do what you get to do. It's not just a jolly. I think they need to understand that bit.", "NTA. Dad doesn't get to horn in on your plans with Missy. Nope. This is a trip the two of you planned. Do not feel guilty! He's the parent. Shame on him for the emotional manipulation! Having Macy go with you would be terrible for her as well!\n\nDoes respite care exist where you live? Your parents should look into that. In addition to someone looking after Macy while they have an evening out without any kids, they could maybe arrange for a couple of days and just the four of you could have some time together.\n\nWhat do they plan to do in the future? There's going to come a time in three short years when both you and Missy are living elsewhere. Macy should be eligible for help from government agencies, and that usually includes group homes, respite care, and in home care.", "NTA you're entire life Macy has been their priority. Where's *your* rest? They had possibly 20+ years without Macy being the focal point at home depending how old they are, but your entire home life has most likely been about Macy because of how close in age you are.\n\nSet a standard NOW before you get walked over for Macy your entire life, be as selfish as needed.", "NTA\n\nMacy is your parents responsibility. it is unfair of your father to pull this stunt.\n\nI appreciate they probably need a night off, but he shouldn't have ambushed your road trip to spend some quality time with your sister Missy", "NTA It is not their chance for a night alone. It's your trip. \n\nIf they want you to babysit for them, they can ask on a might where you don't already have plans.", "NTA. They need to organise their own nights alone, not expect you to change your plans so they can get one. And the \u201cshow appreciation\u201d jab, oof. Not cool, dad.\n\n\u201cDad, this weekend is about me and Missy and we\u2019ve been planning it for ages. We won\u2019t be changing it.

I can empathize with your parents, but in the end, their kids are their responsibility. You had planned something, and they want to take that away to benefit themselves. It would be appropriate for them to ask you to take your older sister another time (and probably pay you for your trouble), so they can get that alone time, but trying to force you to change your plans to accommodate their wants is a bit selfish.", "NTA.\n\nYou planned this trip in order help \"break the chain\" of how she is retreating from the family. I love this! I mean, a low-functioning sibling can make it very difficult on the other siblings, and this trip feels like it was planned to help cement your relationship with your sister as you both move into independent adulthood. \n\nAnd now your parents want to trash it. I know that sounds harsh, but Macy is probably **the reason** that your sister retreats at home, the barrier to the two of you having space to connect. I also grew up with a low-functioning sibling, so I have some experience here. My brother and I didn't really build a friendship until we were both off to college.\n\nI think it would be awesome if you could *occasionally* (rarely) watch Macy to give your parents a break, but I think it's horrible that they are trying to hijack your special \"sisters weekend\".", "NTA.  Macy wouldn\u2019t not enjoy it, it\u2019s a weekend away. Your dad just wants his own weekend with your mom and is trying to guilt you into providing it.  Maybe they need to look into respite care?

You planned a trip for you and Missy, you did *not* plan your parents date night.\n\nIf they want alone time they can ask for it *on a date and time you don't already have plans*. \n\nYour holiday is not an excuse for their private time. You are not responsible for Macy *in any way, shape or form*. You might help out, but she is your parents responsibility. \n\nFinal thought: the person this is most unfair to is Missy. She's been saving and looking forward to a weekend away, a moment without Macy or your parents. And your dad wants you to take Macy so *they* have a break. *This is supposed to be a break for Missy* and the utter *selfishness* of your parents is shining through here. Sure, they're probably burnt out, but Missy's borderline *neglected* and they want \"private time\"? No fucking way.", "NTA. It was clear the trip was with OP and Missy.  The parents jumped to conclusions to make plans away for themselves without confirming care was in place for Macy.", "NTA\n\nToo bad for Mom and Dad they decided to have kids.

They shouldn\u2019t need to hijack y\u2019all\u2019s trip to do that. It\u2019s inconsiderate of them towards you both imo.", "Nta, your parents are trying to toss Macy to you for a trip they've already known you planned but just the other sister, so they could have a night free of her. That's just crappy. If you would like to help your parents, offer to take Macy out to a place you can handle for an evening and then they can be alone or they can pay you to babysit her. But not to spring it on you just so that they can have some alone time.", "NTA. If she has the mentality of a toddler you are basically taking a toddler on your fun girls trip. Tell your parents no, firmly, and set a strong boundary. Maybe you can spend time with her another time. Good luck with it and I hope you guys have fun on your trip. New car, you say? Plenty of loud music.", "NTA.  Your parents want a night off - understandable, but your other sister needs a time out.   The two of you have been robbed of something because of the oldest one - its not her fault, but you both need a time away from it.  Taking her along just defeats the purpose of that - so stick to your guns and don't feel bad about this.\n\nYour parents are going to have to figure this out - you will be the first to leave home, followed by your younger sister - you should foster a good relationship with each other now so that you have each other for support later when your parents try to lay the big guilt trip on you about your sisters future care after they are gone.  If they want a night off, they need to arrange someone to look after her for an evening.  You and your younger sister should enjoy your time away.  \n\nI feel bad for your parents, but they have started to realise that you and your other sister can walk away.  And that frightens them - they probably thought you would always be there to take care of her.", "INFO.  What are you showing appreciation for by taking both your sisters with you ?? \n\nAlso, what do your parents do to show their appreciation of you and Missy ?? \n\n\nI find it disturbing that Missy is shutting down at home, and thank your deities that Missy has you looking out for her.   However, your parents response to you giving Missy a break is to try and foist your high maintenance sister Macy on you both so THEY can get a rest.   That\u2019s so very very wrong", "Ask your parents if it\u2019s really worth hurting Macy and alienating you and Missy from them.

It\u2019s not your job to provide them with a night alone. \n\nAnd show your appreciation for what exactly? \u201cThanks dad for always treating me like an after thought and as though I didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nLook, I get it\u2019s tough for your parents. Being the parent of a special needs kid is hard. But it doesn\u2019t make it your responsibility in any way, shape or form.", "Show appreciation for what? Being pushed aside? No this is for you two because of Macy. You're not taking Macy on your trip to establish happiness outside of her. If they want a night out they are not to use you as a babysitter for their adult child daughter", "NTA! I think it\u2019s wonderful what you\u2019re doing for your younger sister. You have a right to have a child free weekend. Your disabled sister is not your responsibility. She is your parent\u2019s responsibility. Your dad is way out of line.", "NTA.

That would include coordinating with you, and maybe payment for caring for your sister or offering the free night as a holiday or birthday present.", "NTA.

God, parents are selfish pricks sometimes.", "NTA. Your parents are ultimately responsible for Macy. While she is your sister she is not your child to supervise. You and Missy are just as entitled to night out without Macy as your parents are. Take your trip and enjoy yourselves.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure your parents get a night alone. Let them hire a sitter. Let them ask the grandparents or other family members for help.

Why don't they have a sitter already?", "Hi from another person with a special needs sibling! \n\nI just want to say I get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014I get feeling like your parents are stretched thin as it is, and feeling like you could be doing more, and feeling obligated to be, at times, the third parent so that your parents can catch a break. It\u2019s not ideal. It\u2019s often not easy or cheap to get other special needs carers, so a lot of the time it falls to someone in the family to do it. And I 100% understand the guilt of enjoying yourself knowing that it means others in your family won\u2019t have the same opportunity.\n\nBut one thing it took me a long time to understand is that you can set boundaries and still be helpful and present in your family. At the end of the day, you\u2019re *not* the third parent, and you\u2019re not responsible for balancing out the struggles your parents are going through. You and Missy saved up for this trip and planned it together\u2014this is *your* time, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about that!\n\nSo first off, hold your ground. And secondly, I think some of the other commenters have suggested this, but if you do still want to give your parents a break, you can always compromise by offering to watch Macy at some other time to give your parents their own chance to escape (not this one, because this one is yours). You most definitely are not obligated to make this sort of offer, but you sound very loving and kind, and I think it\u2019s a gesture that would be appreciated if you wanted to do it.\n\n(And one last thing that I want to say very clearly is that your parents shouldn\u2019t be asking this of you. This is different from asking you to stay home on a night so that they can have a date night\u2014this is asking you to sacrifice a vacation you saved up and planned for so that they can have a break instead of you, which is unacceptable. You saying that your mom \u201cagreed reluctantly\u201d and your dad implied that doing this is how to show appreciation is raising some alarm bells for me, personally. My parents would never ask this of me or my other sibling. It might have to do with your age\u2014they\u2019re likely very used to having your help, and not necessarily prepared for the consequences of you becoming more independent. Please be mindful of how you\u2019re being treated and look out for yourself! It\u2019s a tough dynamic to navigate and it\u2019s great to try to empathize and help out, but you\u2019re not obligated to be free childcare for a sibling, ever, and your parents shouldn\u2019t treat you like you are.
