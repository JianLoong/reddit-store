INFO:  Have your parents made arrangements for Macy's care once they are unable to care for her?", "NTA and let them know that.  You felt neglected and you see the same signs in your baby sister.  You are doing their job for them by paying additional attention to Missy.  If they want alone time, they can get a sitter for Macy.  Raising Macy isn't your job.", "NTA. Have your parents shown any concern for Missy? \nYou\u2019re a very sweet sibling. Macy is not your child and it doesn\u2019t seem like something she would enjoy. Your dad is being selfish.\n\nEdit to change \u201csister\u201d to \u201csibling.\u201d I thought OP specified they were F too until a re-read.", "NTA whatsoever. You are 18. Missy is 15. It won't feel like it right now but you are so young. Too young to be shouldered with this type of guilt.\n\nIt sounds like you're extremely emotionally intelligent and picking up on not only 1) how you've been affected by the situation but 2) how your sister might be feeling, even though she hasn't said it, and even though your parents seemingly haven't noticed. I wouldn't second-guess your own judgement here, I reckon you're bang on.\n\nIt also sounds like your parents need a dose of reality but I suspect they're tired. People say and do some weird things when they're over-tired and emotionally exhausted. That said, I really don't like the manipulation of 'it's a way to show your appreciation' \u2013 to pull out a quote my own Mum said to me once \"you didn't ask to be born\".\n\nIf you can I'd stand your ground but be very honest with them about why it's important you do what you get to do. It's not just a jolly. I think they need to understand that bit.", "NTA. Dad doesn't get to horn in on your plans with Missy. Nope. This is a trip the two of you planned. Do not feel guilty! He's the parent. Shame on him for the emotional manipulation! Having Macy go with you would be terrible for her as well!\n\nDoes respite care exist where you live? Your parents should look into that. In addition to someone looking after Macy while they have an evening out without any kids, they could maybe arrange for a couple of days and just the four of you could have some time together.\n\nWhat do they plan to do in the future? There's going to come a time in three short years when both you and Missy are living elsewhere. Macy should be eligible for help from government agencies, and that usually includes group homes, respite care, and in home care.", "NTA you're entire life Macy has been their priority. Where's *your* rest? They had possibly 20+ years without Macy being the focal point at home depending how old they are, but your entire home life has most likely been about Macy because of how close in age you are.\n\nSet a standard NOW before you get walked over for Macy your entire life, be as selfish as needed.", "NTA\n\nMacy is your parents responsibility. it is unfair of your father to pull this stunt.\n\nI appreciate they probably need a night off, but he shouldn't have ambushed your road trip to spend some quality time with your sister Missy", "NTA It is not their chance for a night alone.

I can empathize with your parents, but in the end, their kids are their responsibility. You had planned something, and they want to take that away to benefit themselves.

I love this! I mean, a low-functioning sibling can make it very difficult on the other siblings, and this trip feels like it was planned to help cement your relationship with your sister as you both move into independent adulthood. \n\nAnd now your parents want to trash it. I know that sounds harsh, but Macy is probably **the reason** that your sister retreats at home, the barrier to the two of you having space to connect. I also grew up with a low-functioning sibling, so I have some experience here. My brother and I didn't really build a friendship until we were both off to college.\n\nI think it would be awesome if you could *occasionally* (rarely) watch Macy to give your parents a break, but I think it's horrible that they are trying to hijack your special \"sisters weekend\".", "NTA.  Macy wouldn\u2019t not enjoy it, it\u2019s a weekend away. Your dad just wants his own weekend with your mom and is trying to guilt you into providing it.  Maybe they need to look into respite care?

You are not responsible for Macy *in any way, shape or form*. You might help out, but she is your parents responsibility. \n\nFinal thought: the person this is most unfair to is Missy. She's been saving and looking forward to a weekend away, a moment without Macy or your parents. And your dad wants you to take Macy so *they* have a break. *This is supposed to be a break for Missy* and the utter *selfishness* of your parents is shining through here. Sure, they're probably burnt out, but Missy's borderline *neglected* and they want \"private time\"? No fucking way.", "NTA. It was clear the trip was with OP and Missy.

Plenty of loud music.", "NTA.  Your parents want a night off - understandable, but your other sister needs a time out.   The two of you have been robbed of something because of the oldest one - its not her fault, but you both need a time away from it.  Taking her along just defeats the purpose of that - so stick to your guns and don't feel bad about this.\n\nYour parents are going to have to figure this out - you will be the first to leave home, followed by your younger sister - you should foster a good relationship with each other now so that you have each other for support later when your parents try to lay the big guilt trip on you about your sisters future care after they are gone.  If they want a night off, they need to arrange someone to look after her for an evening.  You and your younger sister should enjoy your time away.  \n\nI feel bad for your parents, but they have started to realise that you and your other sister can walk away.  And that frightens them - they probably thought you would always be there to take care of her.", "INFO.  What are you showing appreciation for by taking both your sisters with you ?? \n\nAlso, what do your parents do to show their appreciation of you and Missy ?? \n\n\nI find it disturbing that Missy is shutting down at home, and thank your deities that Missy has you looking out for her.

They are not people you need to take care of.  Especially after they did such a shit job taking care of you.", "NTA.

Why don't they have a sitter already?", "Hi from another person with a special needs sibling! \n\nI just want to say I get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014I get feeling like your parents are stretched thin as it is, and feeling like you could be doing more, and feeling obligated to be, at times, the third parent so that your parents can catch a break. It\u2019s not ideal. It\u2019s often not easy or cheap to get other special needs carers, so a lot of the time it falls to someone in the family to do it. And I 100% understand the guilt of enjoying yourself knowing that it means others in your family won\u2019t have the same opportunity.\n\nBut one thing it took me a long time to understand is that you can set boundaries and still be helpful and present in your family. At the end of the day, you\u2019re *not* the third parent, and you\u2019re not responsible for balancing out the struggles your parents are going through. You and Missy saved up for this trip and planned it together\u2014this is *your* time, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about that!\n\nSo first off, hold your ground. And secondly, I think some of the other commenters have suggested this, but if you do still want to give your parents a break, you can always compromise by offering to watch Macy at some other time to give your parents their own chance to escape (not this one, because this one is yours). You most definitely are not obligated to make this sort of offer, but you sound very loving and kind, and I think it\u2019s a gesture that would be appreciated if you wanted to do it.\n\n(And one last thing that I want to say very clearly is that your parents shouldn\u2019t be asking this of you. This is different from asking you to stay home on a night so that they can have a date night\u2014this is asking you to sacrifice a vacation you saved up and planned for so that they can have a break instead of you, which is unacceptable. You saying that your mom \u201cagreed reluctantly\u201d and your dad implied that doing this is how to show appreciation is raising some alarm bells for me, personally. My parents would never ask this of me or my other sibling. It might have to do with your age\u2014they\u2019re likely very used to having your help, and not necessarily prepared for the consequences of you becoming more independent. Please be mindful of how you\u2019re being treated and look out for yourself! It\u2019s a tough dynamic to navigate and it\u2019s great to try to empathize and help out, but you\u2019re not obligated to be free childcare for a sibling, ever, and your parents shouldn\u2019t treat you like you are.
