He's in his eighties now and still can't do much beyond making toast and boiling an egg. Thank goodness times have changed.", "You mean the SILs will take care of him, if there are any married to their those misogynistic  brothers.", "My father is 66 and happily cooks dinner on nights when my mom works late. He enjoys it! And even if he didn't cook, he's perfectly capable of getting chips or nuts out of the cupboard so he won't starve. If he sat around waiting for my mom or me to feed him he'd have died a long time ago.\n\nNTA, OP. You set a boundary, he decided he'd test it. Next time, he can get a hotel room and bug room service for food.", "I was only 7or8 when I decided I was tired of waiting for my parents to get up and make the Saturday morning fry-up, so I started doing it myself. Fried eggs and bacon and potatoes, whole kit.\n\nOn the other hand, my 72yo dad still doesnt really know how to cook much. Except he does a great breakfast too. He has all the skills to cook just about anything, he's just never experimented with anything except breakfast. And everything else kinda intimidates him.\n\nBut you know what he did last weekend? He spent 4hrs cooking up like 4 loafs up bread into his amazing French toast. Then he packaged them all into handy 2-slice baggies. \n\nAnd now the freezer has French toast for like month.", "Yup. My grandfather immediately started dating his late wife's cousin after his wife passed away. \n\nShe's a lovely woman at we all treat well, but none of the family was too impressed with the grandfather. \n\nIt's honestly continually shocking how infantile he is. Just utterly unable to care for himself, yet demanding that his needs be met for him.", "I am a pharmacist working with the elderly, mostly men- and this is spot on. They don\u2019t know how to order refills, manage their medications, etc. Or they don\u2019t agree to take more medications to better manage their diabetes etc, let alone change their diet. Some even blame their wives for their poor eating habits, e.g. \u201cshe fills my plate up too much!\u201d is something I have legit heard. No thought that you could just\u2026 not eat all of it? Or make your own plate? \n\nThat actually sums is up. There is no **personal responsibility.**", "\u201cYou\u2019re just here because it\u2019s convenient for me. I already have your replacement picked out.\u201d \n\nWhat love.", "this is the spirit, pls stay that way forever.", "My mom was born in the 50s and she said my granddad (who was born in the 1910s) always made dinner on Fridays.  She said he could flip pancakes crazy high and would do it to make them laugh.", "My friend found her toddler in the snack cupboard. Problem was, she kept the unhealthy snacks in the cupboard above the fridge, and her toddler (~2-3yo) had climbed up on the kitchen counter, used the fridge handle as a stepping stone and gotten all the way up there. All in the time it took my friend to put a robe on and go from the bedroom to the kitchen in a small apartment. My friend was also quite impressed with the resourcefulness when seeing her toddler sitting up there having cookies for breakfast.", "This is like when a child holds their breath until they almost or do pass out because they were throwing a tantrum. Grandpa needs to grow the f*ck up and be an adult for once in his miserable life.", "On his 90th birthday, Dad and I ( mostly Dad) made biscuits  for his birthday party. Later that day.    They were good.  I videoed that .  He passed 2 years later. Heart issues.  I love having that morning video.", "Thankfully,  we have mostly healthy snacks and for some reason,  though she loves snacks she'll mostly want raisins in those little packets or granola bars from the snack cabinet. It is low to the ground though and the candies and such are up high. I'm sure I will have to devise a better plan for keeping her out soon enough. She usually doesn't use her toddler tower for evil,  but I wouldn't put it past her. She can reach the ice maker and water dispenser from her height and has been very good about not pushing them besides the first couple times she realize she could do it. Toddlers are something.", "She's already broken most of the cabinet and drawer locks. She realized if she pulls hard enough, things break."]}
