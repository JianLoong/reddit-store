I was a bit nervous, but I told myself he probably just realized he was going the wrong way/forgot something at his house, so I kept walking.  The guy kept following, not directly behind me, but across the street at the same pace as me, he would periodically glance at me, I kept calm and kept telling myself that I was just being paranoid; then he starts crossing the street, not straight towards me, he sort of began inching his way across the road while he was walking, and little by little he was getting closer to me, he was almost in the middle of the street when a car drove up next to me, I must have been visibly scared because the older lady in the car asked if I was okay and if that man was bothering me.  The man quickly turned back towards the sidewalk and walked ahead, the women ended up driving next to me until I got home to make sure I was safe, and I am still very grateful towards her, she quite possibly saved me from a very scary situation.  Now fast forward about a year, it's Halloween and every year the house I think I saw the man leave from goes all out, bunches of decor and lights and stuff.  I leave with my dad to go to a haunted house while my baby brother went trick-or-treating with my stepmom.  I get back and my brother tells me that he got a \"super big\" candy bar from the \"Halloween house,\" he has been calling that house the \"Halloween house\" since they decorated, and I immediately felt uneasy about the candy bar.  My stepmom put the Halloween basket in a place he can't reach (so he wouldn't eat it all and get a stomach ache.) I tried to ignore the feeling of suspicion but eventually it got the better of me, there was no one in the room and I thought I could just check it really quick, make sure the candys sealed and whatnot.  My stepmom comes in and asks why I'm touching my brothers candy, and that it's not mine to touch.  I explained to her that I was just checking it, and she said that I'm being completely paranoid and putting my problems on other people, I tried to explain that the candy came from the house I always avoid, and she said that I shouldn't touch stuff that's not mine, and that I don't have a right to act like the parent.  I feel that I was just trying to protect my baby brother, my stepmom thinks Im being paranoid and have no right to touch his candy, and my dad is remaining neutral and not picking either side.

Checking it will do absolutely no harm and if it makes you feel better, then so be it. \n\n99.9 percent of the time, candy will be fine. I still check my kids stuff to make sure it isn\u2019t opened. Every year one or two pieces get tossed out. Are they fine? Probably. Is it most likely that some random pieces just got opened in all the hustle and bustle? Yep. Does it still go in the trash. Damn right. \n\nIt\u2019s sweet you felt the need to check. If your step mom had such a major problem with it, I\u2019d just drop it and move on. You did what you felt was right, and that\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA what the heck is wrong with your stepmom? You checking the candy isn't hurting anything. And how is that \"acting like a parent\"? You're doing like a concerned big sister. Seems like she was really gunning for you to be trying to steal the candy instead of trying to look out for your brother. Tell her it is entirely inappropriate for her to treat you in that manner and that checking the candy won't hurt anything. If she's upset about it, then there's something else going on with her.

Your step-mom is right though, you're being paranoid about the candy. I think if someone was going to tamper with food, they would get off on watching the person suffer from what they did. I take it there is a significant age difference between you and your little brother. Older siblings sometimes take on a defacto parental role. Do yourself a favor, let your parents handle the parenting. Only help if they ask, or offer to help when it seems like they need some help. I have to get after my oldest about this, they are 7.5 years, not quite 14 years,  and not quite 17 years older than their younger siblings.", "NTA", "YTA. There's not a single verified case of Halloween candy being tampered with.", "Thank you so much for this comment, I've been worried that I'm too parent-y and not acting like a sibling, my stepmom always tells me that I shouldn't act worried when he falls or take something away that I think is dangerous, I've seen so many memes of sibling relationships and I can never relate to them, sometimes I do wonder if I'm overprotective.", "It's super concerning that the stepmom seems dismissive of what happened to OP. That is genuinely scary.", "Yeah, our relationship has been kind of off lately, lots of family drama stuff is going on.", "In the wrong? For checking candy? She didn't snatch it from the kid, didn't try to force him not to go to the house, didn't even try to say the candy HAD to be thrown away. This is the mildest stuff.", "Why is she mad you are helping? Jeez. Most parents would so appreciate a older sibling keeping an eye out. They have a lot to do and knowing their littlest is safe because you actually give a damn is awesome.\n\nDon't ever let her feel you are bad. You love him and want to protect him. Not all sibling relationships are alike. Some hate each other, others are besties, some are only there for fun and ignore anything serious, and others especially with an age gap have some type of watching of the younger involved.\n\nI've babysat many kids with older siblings who should have been doing that themselves, and many just were turds to the younger one. I don't think your stepmom gets how lovely she has it.", "For buying into the candy tampering myth.\n\nMisinformation is dangerous.", "Once again, all she wanted to do was check the candy from one specific house. That's hardly going down a misinformation rabbit hole or even engaging in Local News Scare Tactics.", "Girl that\u2019s not parenty. I\u2019m always looking out for my little brother and he\u2019s in his 20s. NTA.", "Just throw the candy out and buy him new ones.
