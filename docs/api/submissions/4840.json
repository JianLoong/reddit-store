You do not owe her a comparable gift - but I\u2019m a bit more sympathetic to her if she spent more on you; and even less sympathetic if she thinks you owe her more based on her ideas about your means.", "NTA Wedding vendor here; your sister was being tacky complaining about your gift. It was what you could afford. The real issue here is that she is jealous of the gift your husband gave you and wants one for herself. A general rule for weddings is that each person should give minimum $100 per person if they can (so $200 per couple) to cover the cost of your meal and then some at the wedding. Family and bridal party is expected to give more if they are able, but this is more of a guideline. Of course not all people can afford a generous gift. Attending is gift enough. Your sister broke wedding etiquette with her selfishness. The correct response from your sister should have been a heartfelt thank you. The problem here is not the gift at all, but rather the fact that she is jealous of you and what your partner does for you. Sounds like her husband can\u2019t afford her expensive tastes and she is taking it out on you. Give yourself some healthy space from her.", "NTA - From my experience, it is generally expected that the cost of a gift will at least cover the cost of the meal", "NTA\n\nI think $150 is a solid wedding gift for a family member. It honestly sounds to me though that your sister spent a lot of money buying gifts for your wedding, and was hoping it'd be reciprocated. Doesn't mean you have to give her an equal amount though, hence NTA but this could be one angle. On the other hand, your \"can't afford it\" comment doesn't make sense because you clearly can afford it? You own the necklace yourself. Again doesn't mean you have to buy it for her and she shouldn't be asking you about more gifts.", "I\u2019ll go with NTA but here\u2019s some perspective \n\nI gifted my sister NOTHING for her wedding. We had an argument and a fallout. No gifts whatsoever. \n\nWhen my wife\u2019s brother got married, we sponsored their entire honeymoon, flights and hotel included. \n\nWhen my niece was born (same sister\u2019s daughter who I had a fallout with) I gifted her an iPhone and a MacBook. \n\nI gifted my dad an iPhone for no reason. I gifted my wife a 15$ bouquet of flowers for our anniversary. \n\nWhy I\u2019m listing all this is two fold\n\n- First, a gift is given with love, not as an obligation. If you\u2019re close to your sister, gift what you\u2019d love for her to have. If that amount for you is 150$ - so be it. Why I feel this is less though, is you seem to think that gifting everyone else the same as what you\u2019d gift your sister is fine\u2026 and it is, if you only care about her as much as you would a random person\u2026 in which case that would suffice (also why you have the NTA judgement from me) but if you\u2019re indeed close, this amount (to me) seems less. \n\n- second, like I stated earlier, a gift is given with love. It doesn\u2019t have to be monetary. Since you chose to donate monetarily, you made it such. The fact that your sister expected more of you and your mother agrees is sort of assholish of them but also indicates what they feel the amount should be. I would\u2019ve given them an AH judgement had they asked. \n\nNonetheless, you\u2019re entitled to give whatever you felt like giving and 150$ was what you felt like. So NTA but I wouldn\u2019t look forward to a warm relationship going forward.", "NTA. You can give whatever you want as a gift (or choose to not even give anything).\n\nI would say that $150 does seem a bit on the lower side, especially considering you are her sister. I guess it depends where you live, but around here the standard is usually $100/guest ($200 for a couple). I got married this year, and that was by far the most common amount. However, some people gave more, some gave less, and a few didn't give anything. We were just happy to have our guests attend and didn't care about what they gave though, and your sister is an AH for complaining about it to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My aunt had gotten married maybe 12 years ago and just had a small backyard wedding.

On the other hand, family heirlooms have been given, which were priceless.", "I registered with my friends in mind and was asked by my parents\u2019 and in laws friends to register at a few very exclusive stores so I did.

What entitled crap is this?\n\nI did once see a $120 bathroom wastebasket on a registry for a wedding I was invited to.  DUDE!!!! My bathroom has $10-20 waste baskets from Target, I am not buying you a fancier one than I can afford for myself (that was also the cheapest thing on there- other than open donation to a charity).  I donated $150 to the charity.\n\nOh, my baby cousin, that frankly I adore, even though we are not close as adults, registered for an $800 set of knives.  I thought...I love you, but my OWN knives (and I cook, she does not), are $80 from Target, and they work fine. (I do have 1-2 blades that are nicer).  And I had the same thought back then- I am not buying a new couple or even a middle aged couple something nicer than I can afford for myself. I think that is a reasonable boundary.  I do adore her, and I was doing ok even at that point- I bought her kitchen aide mixer- most expensive gift I ever bought anyone.

She's been offended about that ever since her own engagement, and when she was planning her pre-wedding events she asked if we were doing any and we were like \"nah,\" which she took as us judging her lol. I do think that a lot of modern day weddings and all of the pre-wedding stuff (engagement parties, then wedding showers, then elaborate bachelorettes, equally elaborate rehearsal dinners / after parties, then the wedding itself, etc) does come off as a bit of a tacky cash grab, but that's an opinion that I'll express anonymously on Reddit and never say out loud, especially to anyone who is about to / just got married, lol.", "Even so \u2014 demanding a gift from OP that\u2019s the same as *the bridal gift OP\u2019s husband gave OP on their own wedding day* is really tacky.

Give me one too.\u201d", "Exactly, the necklace doesn't contribute anything to the sister's husband. \\*Also\\* when I was setting up my own wedding registry I made sure to have about 1/4 of the gifts on the registry under $20 for three reasons: 1.) For some of my family or friends, a $10 soap dish is what they can afford and I don't want to shame them by not having anything they can contribute on the list, 2.) For people who like to stack gifts, i.e. they get the $10 soap dish, a $5 towel, a $20 bath mat, etc so they all match, 3.) For people who have a set amount they spend on weddings and the $140 kitchen gadget they got as the main gift is under their budget so they tack on a $10 soap dish to round it out.", "My mom likes to throw off registry items. She gets something on the registry too tho. She likes giving a personalized door knocker or something like it to coues getting married. She has a whole Thing she does for baby showers. She decorates a hanging shoe organizer and puts various baby things in the holders like thermometers, fels naptha, baby medicines.

Depending on your income that been be 5-10 hours of your life to afford that. Your sister needs to get her head out of her booty. She got a gift. Your sister is being greedy and trying to get others to pay for jewelry and trip. F that", "NTA\n\nMiss Manners I suspect would be horribly disappointed in your sister in particular as well as your stepmother. \n\nMany times in her column she has stated that a gift IS NOT THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO A WEDDING.  The gift is optional.  Seems like your sister was treating it like a gift grab. \n\nSo the fact you gave anything should be considered more than enough.", "NTA you've given loads. Also why does she have a necklace on her registry. It's hardly a gift for the couple.", ">I didn't appreciate the effort put into the wedding.\n\n\nI'll be damned I didn't know that wedding gifts have to be priced in proportion to how expensive the wedding was LMAO \n\n\nNTA", "Nta.

For instance, the last wedding I went to was in a park, (the city charges $10 to reserve that space,) the DJ was one of their friends, the food was a taco truck and the bride made the cake.  This couple will do very well in life, (they both have advanced degrees,) but they have a quarter million in student loans between them and knew they really didn\u2019t need to blow a bunch of money on a wedding\u2026", "It's a wedding, not a rave.", "That\u2019s not really true etiquette wise. Like Miss Manners would be appalled. It\u2019s a party you host for others. People should not be expected to cover some of the cost. How entitled", "Oh my god seeing how your wedding registry is so thoughtful... I just laughed out loud at the absolute ridicule of asking for a tiffany necklace and complaining about 150 free dollars in their pocket. I just can't with people like that. NTA", "And originally done so that guests don't feel they have to buy a super expensive gift and still get the B&G a nice gift.  The fancy dishes and silverware are still usually sold by place setting and old registries just noted the pattern the couple picked out.", "I am also in my 50s, and would not expect a grad student in her 20s to gift anyone more than what she did. $150 was pretty generous in her time of life and situation!", ">600 potato peeler\n\nI have SO MANY questions, lol. What makes a potato peeler $600?! Is it only for potatoes, or can you peel other vegetables with it, too?", "Or those that work in a large office where everyone throws in $20 and it adds up to a big ticket item. I received my crib from my office baby shower because a ton of people put in and the higher ups put in decent amounts.", "Agreed. Most of it makes more sense in the context of the cultural norm as being staying with your parents til you're married. Which, the way things are currently going may become way more normal again.", "....I need to set up a registry for my cat's birthday hahaha", "That's brilliant! My mom goes off registry pretty often for baby stuff too, but mostly for sizes. She sees \"newborn\" size, scoffs and gets 6-9mo size. She said everyone gets so many newborn size onesies that you barely even get to see the kid in it once before they grow out of it. 6-9 size is the \"oh shit, we need to buy them clothes\" point, so she makes sure they have some.", "I have a feeling that she added it specifically so her sister would get her the same necklace, since she herself has it. Like a huge hint of 'hey I want this, too'\n\nNTA. You gave what you could afford. That's all anyone can ask. It's entitled to expect more.", "Not to mention that OPs stepmum reckons she \u2018didn\u2019t appreciate the effort put into the wedding\u2019\nPretty sure couples celebrate THEIR wedding, to celebrate THEIR newly formed union. The wedding wasn\u2019t held for other people, it was held, because they wanted to be celebrated, otherwise a courthouse wedding would have done the trick. How they pull everything off and how much they spend on that day is their decision, unless others, like parents, pay for the thing. They are the only reason money is being spent, people are taking time out of their lives to come and celebrate with them. Coming from a country where wedding registries aren\u2019t the norm, I am so confused as to why US couples even get to choose the brand of dehumidifier they\u2019d prefer. I just can\u2019t fathom being that\u2026 greedy? They literally put anything on there they can\u2019t afford themselves, but expect other people to come up with a solution. Just because someone decides to play fancy, you don\u2019t have to step up to match their newly found \u2018prestige\u2019. Just no. An invitation is an invitation, putting up what present you want in exchange for peoples presence at your so called \u2018most important, special day\u2019 and having a go at them if they don\u2019t meet your expectations just seems so weird to me. Either you want them there or not, either you want to spend the money on them being there and celebrating or not. Don\u2019t live above your own standards and expect other people to come up with substitutions for it in form of lavish gifts. Yuck", "I looked it up. The necklaces are between $375 and $1,600. Why would someone buy that as a wedding gift that is only for the bride? She's ridiculously entitled. Just because others could afford her pricy gifts doesn't mean you can and you should not be expected to. She wants a command \"gift\" where she gets to order you to spend YOUR money how SHE decides. NTA", "If all they could give was $25, that was enough. You don't get to question your gifts. Rude.", "See I love useful, thoughtful gifts like that. Especially when you are budgeting, you don't always think to get yourself handy household or outdoor gifts, and some of them really make the task at hand so much easier.", "Ok, let me clean the coffee off my tablet.  Baby panda fat!", "That is me and Yankee Candles or the ones at Bath and Body Works.  I always get them on sale though.  I ain't paying $30 for a candle.", "I hate this. to me, the \"cover your plate\" when it comes to giving wedding gifts is BS."]}
