Stepmom needs to back off too...not her business either (but it's obvious where the greed comes from) it's also very very lowclass to essentially attempt to browbeat you about it at the holiday dinner...did they charge everyone an entry charge for that too to cover the cost of turkey and cranberries?", "NtA but your sister is.

You do not owe her a comparable gift - but I\u2019m a bit more sympathetic to her if she spent more on you; and even less sympathetic if she thinks you owe her more based on her ideas about your means.", "NTA Wedding vendor here; your sister was being tacky complaining about your gift. It was what you could afford. The real issue here is that she is jealous of the gift your husband gave you and wants one for herself. A general rule for weddings is that each person should give minimum $100 per person if they can (so $200 per couple) to cover the cost of your meal and then some at the wedding. Family and bridal party is expected to give more if they are able, but this is more of a guideline. Of course not all people can afford a generous gift. Attending is gift enough. Your sister broke wedding etiquette with her selfishness. The correct response from your sister should have been a heartfelt thank you. The problem here is not the gift at all, but rather the fact that she is jealous of you and what your partner does for you. Sounds like her husband can\u2019t afford her expensive tastes and she is taking it out on you. Give yourself some healthy space from her.", "NTA - From my experience, it is generally expected that the cost of a gift will at least cover the cost of the meal", "NTA\n\nI think $150 is a solid wedding gift for a family member. It honestly sounds to me though that your sister spent a lot of money buying gifts for your wedding, and was hoping it'd be reciprocated. Doesn't mean you have to give her an equal amount though, hence NTA but this could be one angle. On the other hand, your \"can't afford it\" comment doesn't make sense because you clearly can afford it? You own the necklace yourself. Again doesn't mean you have to buy it for her and she shouldn't be asking you about more gifts.", "I\u2019ll go with NTA but here\u2019s some perspective \n\nI gifted my sister NOTHING for her wedding. We had an argument and a fallout. No gifts whatsoever. \n\nWhen my wife\u2019s brother got married, we sponsored their entire honeymoon, flights and hotel included. \n\nWhen my niece was born (same sister\u2019s daughter who I had a fallout with) I gifted her an iPhone and a MacBook. \n\nI gifted my dad an iPhone for no reason. I gifted my wife a 15$ bouquet of flowers for our anniversary. \n\nWhy I\u2019m listing all this is two fold\n\n- First, a gift is given with love, not as an obligation. If you\u2019re close to your sister, gift what you\u2019d love for her to have. If that amount for you is 150$ - so be it. Why I feel this is less though, is you seem to think that gifting everyone else the same as what you\u2019d gift your sister is fine\u2026 and it is, if you only care about her as much as you would a random person\u2026 in which case that would suffice (also why you have the NTA judgement from me) but if you\u2019re indeed close, this amount (to me) seems less. \n\n- second, like I stated earlier, a gift is given with love. It doesn\u2019t have to be monetary. Since you chose to donate monetarily, you made it such. The fact that your sister expected more of you and your mother agrees is sort of assholish of them but also indicates what they feel the amount should be. I would\u2019ve given them an AH judgement had they asked. \n\nNonetheless, you\u2019re entitled to give whatever you felt like giving and 150$ was what you felt like. So NTA but I wouldn\u2019t look forward to a warm relationship going forward.", "NTA. You can give whatever you want as a gift (or choose to not even give anything).\n\nI would say that $150 does seem a bit on the lower side, especially considering you are her sister. I guess it depends where you live, but around here the standard is usually $100/guest ($200 for a couple). I got married this year, and that was by far the most common amount. However, some people gave more, some gave less, and a few didn't give anything. We were just happy to have our guests attend and didn't care about what they gave though, and your sister is an AH for complaining about it to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

By having only very expensive items, you are forcing the giver to either buy something more expensive than they can afford OR get something random that isn't on the registry.

While the bride and groom can obviously put whatever they want on the registry, it's more thoughtful to include items in different price categories so more guests can feel included.  My husband and I got married in 2018, and while we had some pricier items on our registry, we also included items that were under $20.

Weddings are more expensive these days and not everyone can afford a generous gift. Even if the couple is only given a card or a small amount or tiny gift, they should be gracious. Too many do treat weddings like fundraisers and that is not the point. That and many people under thirty don't know the wedding gift giving etiquette usually until they are older or have been married themselves.\n\nThe first wedding I attended in my twenties I did not bring a gift because I gave a gift at the bridal shower and I thought that it was the wedding gift giving party. I didn't realize the bridal shower is a completely separate event. I thought it was for giving gifts before the wedding day. So we did not bring a gift to the wedding too. I'm a little embarrassed about it still, but they were kind and never said a thing. \n\nWhen I was married less than half our guests gave us gifts, but we did not complain. We made sure to send thank you cards for attending and being there for us on our special day, especially because several had travelled far. The catering can get very expensive so the goal when gifting cash is to pay for your meal and place at the venue. Knowing this, my husband and I try our best to give $150 per person (so $300 from both of us) for typical weddings and $500 for very close friends and family.

Throw however expensive a party you want to (and can afford).  Whatever you spent is not my problem.
