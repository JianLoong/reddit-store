Stepmom needs to back off too...not her business either (but it's obvious where the greed comes from) it's also very very lowclass to essentially attempt to browbeat you about it at the holiday dinner...did they charge everyone an entry charge for that too to cover the cost of turkey and cranberries?", "NtA but your sister is.

You do not owe her a comparable gift - but I\u2019m a bit more sympathetic to her if she spent more on you; and even less sympathetic if she thinks you owe her more based on her ideas about your means.", "NTA Wedding vendor here; your sister was being tacky complaining about your gift. It was what you could afford. The real issue here is that she is jealous of the gift your husband gave you and wants one for herself. A general rule for weddings is that each person should give minimum $100 per person if they can (so $200 per couple) to cover the cost of your meal and then some at the wedding. Family and bridal party is expected to give more if they are able, but this is more of a guideline. Of course not all people can afford a generous gift. Attending is gift enough. Your sister broke wedding etiquette with her selfishness. The correct response from your sister should have been a heartfelt thank you. The problem here is not the gift at all, but rather the fact that she is jealous of you and what your partner does for you. Sounds like her husband can\u2019t afford her expensive tastes and she is taking it out on you. Give yourself some healthy space from her.", "NTA - From my experience, it is generally expected that the cost of a gift will at least cover the cost of the meal", "NTA\n\nI think $150 is a solid wedding gift for a family member. It honestly sounds to me though that your sister spent a lot of money buying gifts for your wedding, and was hoping it'd be reciprocated. Doesn't mean you have to give her an equal amount though, hence NTA but this could be one angle. On the other hand, your \"can't afford it\" comment doesn't make sense because you clearly can afford it? You own the necklace yourself. Again doesn't mean you have to buy it for her and she shouldn't be asking you about more gifts.", "I\u2019ll go with NTA but here\u2019s some perspective \n\nI gifted my sister NOTHING for her wedding. We had an argument and a fallout. No gifts whatsoever. \n\nWhen my wife\u2019s brother got married, we sponsored their entire honeymoon, flights and hotel included. \n\nWhen my niece was born (same sister\u2019s daughter who I had a fallout with) I gifted her an iPhone and a MacBook. \n\nI gifted my dad an iPhone for no reason. I gifted my wife a 15$ bouquet of flowers for our anniversary. \n\nWhy I\u2019m listing all this is two fold\n\n- First, a gift is given with love, not as an obligation. If you\u2019re close to your sister, gift what you\u2019d love for her to have. If that amount for you is 150$ - so be it. Why I feel this is less though, is you seem to think that gifting everyone else the same as what you\u2019d gift your sister is fine\u2026 and it is, if you only care about her as much as you would a random person\u2026 in which case that would suffice (also why you have the NTA judgement from me) but if you\u2019re indeed close, this amount (to me) seems less. \n\n- second, like I stated earlier, a gift is given with love. It doesn\u2019t have to be monetary. Since you chose to donate monetarily, you made it such. The fact that your sister expected more of you and your mother agrees is sort of assholish of them but also indicates what they feel the amount should be. I would\u2019ve given them an AH judgement had they asked. \n\nNonetheless, you\u2019re entitled to give whatever you felt like giving and 150$ was what you felt like. So NTA but I wouldn\u2019t look forward to a warm relationship going forward.", "NTA. You can give whatever you want as a gift (or choose to not even give anything).\n\nI would say that $150 does seem a bit on the lower side, especially considering you are her sister. I guess it depends where you live, but around here the standard is usually $100/guest ($200 for a couple). I got married this year, and that was by far the most common amount. However, some people gave more, some gave less, and a few didn't give anything. We were just happy to have our guests attend and didn't care about what they gave though, and your sister is an AH for complaining about it to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(Actually I won't, our money is plastic and it'll smell pretty bad if burned xd)", "Good question. OP if you see this, please answer", "The \u201ccompletion discount\u201d is huge. Where we registered, if people bought x percent of the stuff on the registry, everything left was 40% off.", "Every wedding that I have been to where the couple had a registry, it was pretty expensive stuff. Like as a non-related guest be splitting the cost of a cheese knife set. \nAnd then go to other weddings where the couple are just like \"no gifts necessary, we don't want to carry it home\", and people tend to be a bit more generous at giving money at those weddings.", "In theory, yes, but most American couples look to recoup the cost of the reception from the wedding gifts.", "Nobody said you *have* to pay for your meal. You don\u2019t have to give a gift at all, for that matter. It\u2019s just a nice thing to do, assuming you can afford to.", "LOL!!! Dark. I like the way you think. (Save the Pandas!!!)", "My husband and I agree that anything of value from now on shall be measured in grams of baby panda fat.", "Yeah generally if i want to buy a fancy candle it would be anywhere from 25-40e range for me, pushing anything past that it would have to be pretty damn impressive otherwise. If anyone from my family or friend group would ask for a $900 candle I would just laugh at their face.", ">I think I know the country. At least in Germany/Bavaria we are giving cash, so your cost should be covered. This is what we say.\n\nIt is the same in Romania too.", "Also german. But from the north. Same here with the money, so that the couple can cover some of the cost.\nThat is also what is done at larger birthday parties with a lot of none (direct) family guests"]}
