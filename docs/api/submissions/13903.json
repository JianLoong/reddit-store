And she didn\u2019t pay anything.", "So say you\u2019ll stay elsewhere because you\u2019re not paying full price for a shittier deal than everyone else\n\nIf they don\u2019t like that then hire a house with enough bedrooms for everyone.", "The other option is you tell them you are trying for a baby and need the privacy of your own room.", "NTA. I would tell them you don\u2019t mind continuing to split equally IF you get equal space. You should get your own bedroom and bathroom. If they refuse, tell them you\u2019re not coming.", "Like hell am I spending $850 to sleep on an air mattress in a shared space!\n\nYou're NTA. It may be the way it's always been done, but it's clearly not working for you, so you and your wife need to find an alternate plan for your vacation, whether that means she addresses this with her family. You get an even larger space that has enough room for you guys to have your own room, or you find your own accommodations.", "You think OP should pay the same as a family of 7 and sleep on an air mattress?", "Our kids love it, but we work hard every year to make sure everyone\u2019s needs are accommodated and possible sources of conflict are worked out in advance. We also have a smaller family (2 grandparents, 4 parents, 6 grandkids) so that might make it easier. \n\nAnd really it depends a lot on the family. With my in laws we all stay together and love it. With my family we get separate condos so we are together but have our own spaces to avoid stress/drama.", "Lol thank you, I've seen this on so many AITA posts and it drives me up the wall.", "It\u2019s a problem with the husbands friend group. They\u2019re all childless and have lots of discretionary income and free time. They\u2019re also a little younger (I\u2019m 41 and husband is 35 so with spouses there\u2019s like a 15 year age gap between me and his youngest friends wife). I love them all, truly. Give me a camping trip or all the dinner parties you want as a group. They do multiple international trips as a group each year. We get one vacation a year and alternate between one alone and one with the kids. We are always invited on their trips but decline (all but one unfortunate trip to Nashville). This year we booked a trip to a fairly non touristy part of Baja and the friends were very offended because they had also planned a trip to Mexico (Cancun) and we declined, because not our vibe and it\u2019s our one week a year to just be an adult couple on vacation. Friends (not taking the hint) THEN pushed the issue and said \u201cwell if you just change your reservation to a different hotel we can all get rooms together and make this a group trip\u201d. Husband finally had to tell them we really don\u2019t want to do a group trip\u2026which turned into them assuming it was ME refusing to let husband make plans with his friends\u2026and on and on. \nPlot twist, my husband is even more introverted than I am so hates group activities even more than I do. I\u2019m happy to be the buffer. \nSo we will be enjoying 6 days on a remote beach and they can have their fun in Cancun packed 8 adults in an Airbnb. Worth it.", "I'm prepared to split equally with my siblings who have kids, but I think it helps that I'm not being forced into doing that. But I can't understand anybody deciding that adults have to sleep on an air mattress in a living space while kids get a room - especially not while we're all paying equal amounts! The fact that anybody thinks this is appropriate is baffling to me - I would be seeking accommodation nearby and leaving them to pay for themselves.", "He gets his away from them and her!", "I think this is a reasonable take.  We are in a better financial situation than most in our families and don't mind a little extra if it means we can all spend time together.   I'm not going to pay more and get shit accommodation though.  And definitely not every year.", "Do yourself a favor tell them you need the privacy because you're trying for a kid. Easiest way to ensure a private room and no one can say anything without sounding like a jackass.", "If you understand this much about nicotine and caffeine, you know a thing or two about assholes.", "Fuller... easy on the Pepsi", "Literally 2 seconds before I scrolled to this comment I thought to myself \"I would diiiiieeeee\".  \n\nNTA", "Oh man, my dad has 7 siblings, most with children, and most of those children have children. There are approximately 100 of us!\n\nThe past two or three family reunions were literally just camping. One of us booked enough camping land to accommodate us, and then the families brought their own sleeping accommodations (some brought trailers/RVs), utilities, toiletries, etc. We did coordinate meals, though.\n\nu/ZarkMuckerberg9009, maybe this is something your wife's family could consider?", "Yeah, if adults *have* to sleep on an air mattress because they can't find somewhere big enough, then that needs to be shared around from couple to couple (excluding elderly etc). And OP and his wife have had all of their turns for a good long while.", "Indeed!", "It sounds like a nightmare.", "Some beaches have campgrounds. Not sure if the beach in question does, but may be something to look into.", "I like the asshole aficionado myself. That\u2019s the one that makes me giggle the most. Of course the mental image isn\u2019t that great.", "This is the way.", "Seriously\u2014His name is Wesley, and he doesn\u2019t respond to that with \u201cas you wish?\u201d  Bummer.  That\u2019s a missed opportunity right there.", "Imagine being named Jenny and being in middle school when Forest Gump came out.", "/gasp/ Farm Boy!"]}
