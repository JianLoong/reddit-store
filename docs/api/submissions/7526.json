My husband then makes the sneering comment: that in 2023, his aim is to have less sh*t in the house, not more. And went on to point at a few objects around our living room and name them (that I \"keep\"): a plant that I purchased as the first \"living\" thing when we bought our house 10 years ago; a decorative item and and a candle lantern. \n\nMaybe I was hormonal, maybe I was having a bad day or maybe it was the culmination of many years of fighting over clutter. But that comment, especially out of the blue with a visitor over, made me really angry. So later that day, in a very clear example of cutting off my nose to spite my face, I went on to throw away the particular items he described as clutter (so now our 4 meter long media unit contains only a TV and Alexa, and I miss my plant). \n\nBut then I thought, if we are decluttering, why stop there right? \n\nSo over the course of a few days I went around the house throwing things away that he had previously complained about or questioned the existence of. Eventually I landed on things that don't seem to bother him, like this old electronic photo display, gift from his mum that we never set up. Bin. A large framed painting, also a gift from her, but that he never put back on the wall after we removed it for house renovation, so was sitting against the wall behind an armchair for about 9 months (I wasn't \"allowed\" to do it alone due to its weight, but every time I mentioned over the months he would say \"I will do it later\"). Clutter, right? Bin. \n\nNeedless to say, he was not happy. How dare I throw away a gift from his mum? Mind you, I threw away other things that were given by my mum, or friends and family. And I rebuffed him by adding that my definition of clutter was: if it has no purpose, not being used, not intended to be used, and not bringing joy, it is clutter. Clearly his definition of clutter is:  things that didn't belong to him, that he didn't pick, or that he didn't care about. \n\nSo now we had a huge fight, and yet, I am continuing my decluttering crusade, every day throwing away items or giving them to charity.

He nags about clutter while always expecting me to be the one to act on it (seems like he truly thinks he is not a contributer to cluttering). So if I am solely responsible for decluttering, then it comes with consequences. The \"clutter\" I am throwing away is on shared spaces. I would never go into a personal drawer of his and throw away a personal item. He wants a media unit without a pot plant I got when we bought the house?

Especially when I'm already neck deep into our declutter/cleaning project. I think he waits for these moments and then unloads a metric ton of \"what about(s)\" for items that are NOT his. \n\n I have mentioned more than once that he doesn't need to bother himself with patrolling *my* personal items as I have thinned mine to less than 5- Sm or Med \"uhaul\" boxes, clearly labeled and stored neatly, in total.\n\n Where as he has lots (5x's the volume) of boxes and none if it is really accessible. Every box says \"(NOUN) and random...\"\n\nI attempted to explain that random boxes happen, especially at then end of a move. But having 10-15 boxes labeled as \"NOUN + RANDOM\" and stating they're packed properly... (No, they're not) and the boxes are ALL boxes are important (without ever knowing the contents) is insane.\n\nI've never been more austere as I am now. This circle jerk of stupidity and comparison inspires me to toss ALL my non essential belongings into a fire pit.  \n\n\n\nthat are never used/not heirloom/not semtimental.

Well, point made, but you're still AH.\n\nHe's also an AH for complaining about your stuff but defending his. (There's a George Carlin routine where he says, *\"Did you ever notice that other people's stuff is shit, but our shit is \"stuff?!\"*\n\nWhat would be reasonable, if you are at all serious about decluttering, is to work at it together.

His stuff took up most of the space in our house, but he always complained about my stuff.  I felt like I was taking crazy pills. Very understandable why this would drive you mad.\n\nHowever I do think you took it too far by throwing his stuff away without asking.

We have a rule that has served us well, that we don\u2019t get rid of stuff unless the owner - or all the owners, if something is shared - agrees. The two of you should try that. If you want to make a point about clutter, you don\u2019t have to get rid of it on the spot. You can make a pile of it & show it to your husband.  The fact that you\u2019re keeping this up, even though you know he objects, shows that this isn\u2019t about clutter or solving a problem.
