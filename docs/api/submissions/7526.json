My husband then makes the sneering comment: that in 2023, his aim is to have less sh*t in the house, not more. And went on to point at a few objects around our living room and name them (that I \"keep\"): a plant that I purchased as the first \"living\" thing when we bought our house 10 years ago; a decorative item and and a candle lantern. \n\nMaybe I was hormonal, maybe I was having a bad day or maybe it was the culmination of many years of fighting over clutter. But that comment, especially out of the blue with a visitor over, made me really angry. So later that day, in a very clear example of cutting off my nose to spite my face, I went on to throw away the particular items he described as clutter (so now our 4 meter long media unit contains only a TV and Alexa, and I miss my plant). \n\nBut then I thought, if we are decluttering, why stop there right? \n\nSo over the course of a few days I went around the house throwing things away that he had previously complained about or questioned the existence of. Eventually I landed on things that don't seem to bother him, like this old electronic photo display, gift from his mum that we never set up. Bin. A large framed painting, also a gift from her, but that he never put back on the wall after we removed it for house renovation, so was sitting against the wall behind an armchair for about 9 months (I wasn't \"allowed\" to do it alone due to its weight, but every time I mentioned over the months he would say \"I will do it later\"). Clutter, right? Bin. \n\nNeedless to say, he was not happy. How dare I throw away a gift from his mum? Mind you, I threw away other things that were given by my mum, or friends and family. And I rebuffed him by adding that my definition of clutter was: if it has no purpose, not being used, not intended to be used, and not bringing joy, it is clutter. Clearly his definition of clutter is:  things that didn't belong to him, that he didn't pick, or that he didn't care about. \n\nSo now we had a huge fight, and yet, I am continuing my decluttering crusade, every day throwing away items or giving them to charity.

He sounds like an absolute jerk.", "On some questions of why we are even together, couples have long standing arguments for all sorts of reasons: the kids, the wider family, the holidays, the tidying, the life management, the clutter, the list goes on. Just because you have something you disagree on, doesn't mean you don't love each or need to get a divorce, in my opinion (others may disagree). \n\nOn being maliciously compliant: point taken, to an extent. He nags about clutter while always expecting me to be the one to act on it (seems like he truly thinks he is not a contributer to cluttering). So if I am solely responsible for decluttering, then it comes with consequences. The \"clutter\" I am throwing away is on shared spaces. I would never go into a personal drawer of his and throw away a personal item. He wants a media unit without a pot plant I got when we bought the house? Fine, the display above that media unit will also not have a decorative beer mug we bought at Oktoberfest.", ">Clearly his definition of clutter is: things that didn't belong to him, that he didn't pick, or that he didn't care about. \n\nOMFG.\n\nDo we share a husband?!?!?\n\nMine LOVES to interrogate me about all manner of items. Especially when I'm already neck deep into our declutter/cleaning project. I think he waits for these moments and then unloads a metric ton of \"what about(s)\" for items that are NOT his. \n\n I have mentioned more than once that he doesn't need to bother himself with patrolling *my* personal items as I have thinned mine to less than 5- Sm or Med \"uhaul\" boxes, clearly labeled and stored neatly, in total.\n\n Where as he has lots (5x's the volume) of boxes and none if it is really accessible. Every box says \"(NOUN) and random...\"\n\nI attempted to explain that random boxes happen, especially at then end of a move. But having 10-15 boxes labeled as \"NOUN + RANDOM\" and stating they're packed properly... (No, they're not) and the boxes are ALL boxes are important (without ever knowing the contents) is insane.\n\nI've never been more austere as I am now. This circle jerk of stupidity and comparison inspires me to toss ALL my non essential belongings into a fire pit.  \n\n\n\nthat are never used/not heirloom/not semtimental.

Put them aside where he don\u2019t see them until your point is made.", "ESH.\n\nYou know very well this is \"malicious compliance.\" Using his definition of clutter to throw away things you know he wants, to make a point.  Well, point made, but you're still AH.\n\nHe's also an AH for complaining about your stuff but defending his. (There's a George Carlin routine where he says, *\"Did you ever notice that other people's stuff is shit, but our shit is \"stuff?!\"*\n\nWhat would be reasonable, if you are at all serious about decluttering, is to work at it together.  And if he can't be bothered, then you put stuff you want to throw out in a pile, and tell him he has 48 hours to rescue anything he really wants from that pile, but he needs to find a proper place for it (e.g., hanging up the picture).", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re being petty but it\u2019s 100% justified because your husband is being a hypocritical ass.", "NTA the decluttering will continue until morale improves", "NTA\n\nPetty?

His stuff took up most of the space in our house, but he always complained about my stuff.  I felt like I was taking crazy pills. Very understandable why this would drive you mad.\n\nHowever I do think you took it too far by throwing his stuff away without asking. Like another commenter pointed out, your could have put it in a pile and told him this was the \"get rid of\" pile and if he wanted to save anything he would have to take it out and do something with it.\n\nThis way, he could have a visual of the amount of \"stuff\" he's contributing to your \"clutter\"", "ESH.

Why are you married?", "NTA but you should have kept the plant and binned your husband.", "INFO have you considered putting the whole ass man in the bin?", "ESH. Clearly you were doing this stuff specifically out of spite (whether or not it fit his definition of clutter). If you're doing something out of spite, you're probably TA. He was TA for bringing it up in front of company", "ESH. He's been complaining about something but it doesn't sound like he is doing anything about it. You're understandably frustrated,  but you could have boxed up the items and let him decide if they needed to be discarded. Trashing them was a little extreme.", "YTA. We have a rule that has served us well, that we don\u2019t get rid of stuff unless the owner - or all the owners, if something is shared - agrees. The two of you should try that. If you want to make a point about clutter, you don\u2019t have to get rid of it on the spot. You can make a pile of it & show it to your husband.  The fact that you\u2019re keeping this up, even though you know he objects, shows that this isn\u2019t about clutter or solving a problem. It\u2019s about keeping the fight going until you win or you think he\u2019s suffered enough. That\u2019s an AH way to run a marriage.", "NTA. Continue you on.
