Here are some educational resources to ensure you don't continue to perpetuate culture erasure. \n*insert your favorite links*\n\nThey are actively being racist and harmful. Do not let them make you feel bad for their ignorance. \n\nIf this ends up being a friendship ending thing,\nFun thoughts:\nReport them to the school \nPrint put images of Tibetan women with something like \"we matter\" and tape it to their locker\nDiscuss with a tea her where you have a shared class and request to give a presentation on your culture and the significance of these hairstyles. Talk about how you use them in weddings! This is educational for a lot of people, fun, AND a great clap back. Bonus points if you mention being harassed for following your own culture. I wouldn't name names, but I might make uncomfortable eye contact during the presentation to make it socially uncomfortable for the both of them. \nAdapt to the level of confrontation you feel up for. \n\nGood luck! Hopefully, the text will open a productive conversation where they apologize and grow to be better friends and people.", "Can't help but wonder if Annie ACTUALLY had a problem with it or if Laura told her she should have a problem with it.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.
