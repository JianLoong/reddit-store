Humans have shared things between different cultures for millennia.

Not going to continue with this interaction cause you really just don\u2019t get it, I hope one day you do have someone that can explains it to you better than I can and you can understand this. Have a great day/night", "Yes, that the rest of the  world! We know this.  It just inside the  country  know as United states of America   micro braids  has become black only.", "I said it\u2019s complicated because other people get offended by it and think it\u2019s racist. Like I said I don\u2019t think OP did anything wrong, people can wear their hair in whatever that makes them happy", "i take all the talk about black protective hair styles being a culturally black thing which should not be appropriated as the baby talk of entitled people who want to be \"the special ones\" but are un-deserving.", "That\u2019s kind of my point. A lot of what people consider \u201ctheir culture\u201d has been shared between many cultures over the tens of thousands of years humans have had \u201ccultures\u201d at all. Calling a white person wearing braids cultural appropriation is crazy and idiotic and kinda racist is all I\u2019m saying lol", "It\u2019s like people who appoint themselves the judges of who gets to use a disabled parking space or toilet and has a go at someone for \u201cnot looking like they need it\u201d, forcing them to either explain their personal medical situation or to not explain and take the ear bashing publicly.  Busybody virtue signalling. \n\nThey don\u2019t know someone\u2019s background or why they dress how they do.  They don\u2019t know their culture.  It\u2019s not their business to call them out on it based on some half assed assumption of how things appear to them. \n\nCompletely different when you have a fashion brand who decides a certain \u201ccultural look\u201d is going to be their seasons look - THAT\u2019S cultural appropriation for profit making or to be cool and they should be called out on it.", "It hasn\u2019t. Some are trying to make it that way. That\u2019s because they can\u2019t be bothered to learn history."]}
