My daughter kept saying no, that she has no room and she can't move anyone in, but I said that she could just put out a mattress and let MIL try living there for a while since she likes the idea. She asked me if I told MIL about the idea. When I said yes, she just hung up on me and she hasn't picked up any of my calls since.\n\nMy son says that she's mad at me, but I don't get it.

Was it because she's no longer capable of living alone, does she need help/care in her daily life?\n\nYou \"remembered\" your youngest lives alone in the city? Right, so, how long had you forgotten about your daughter?\n\nWhy on earth did you think it would be a good idea to ask your MIL if she wanted to move in with your daughter before asking your daughter if your MIL could visit/move in?\n\nWhat exactly did you say to your daughter when you asked her if she can let your MIL \"try it out\" for a few days?\n\nPut out a mattress? For an 82yo to stay? Please do clarify, was the mattress for your daughter to sleep on (were you kicking your daughter out her own bed?) or for your 82yo MIL?\n\nHow big is your daughter's apartment? Clearly she doesn't have a guest bed, so I've got to ask, is there even a guest room?\n\nWhen you were 30yo, would you have liked to have your grandma living with you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally, I want to understand your mentality here, but yeah, YTA.", "The way you talk about your MIL makes her sound like a dog you can't wait to rehome or put down. And asking your daughter to \"try it out for a few days\" shows how disingenuous you are about caring for your MIL or your daughter. Your adult daughter is not obligated to share her home with her grandma because you volunteered her to or think she doesn't \"help out with the family\". YTA!", "YTA\n\nYou asked your MIL whether she wanted to move in with another person (your daughter), without first discussing it with the other person. Of course you are the ahole! Your daughter's housing isn't yours to give away/invite guests to.\n\nOn top of that, you expect either your 82 year old MIL to sleep on a mattress on the floor or for your daughter to sleep on the floor in her OWN apartment. Mate, YTA on all levels.\n\nIf your MIL is a burden to you, and it sounds like she is, then you need to figure something else out. YOU and your partner chose to take MIL in, your daughter did not. If taking care of MIL is too much of a hassle, you need to find another solution with your partner. Promising MIL to be able to move in with your daughter is NOT a solution UNLESS your daughter had suggested it herself or you had asked her and she had enthusiastically said yes.\n\nI loved my grandma but no way would I be ok with her moving in with me. When she was in her early 80s she started developing dementia and eventually needed so much care that no way she could have been cared for by a single family member in a regular house. Moreover, your daughter is 30, probably works full-time, might have a partner or want a partner, and will probably want to start her own family in the next 5 years or so. No way that she would want an elderly dependent person around for that. And as she said, there's currently not even enough space for hosting another person because MIL or she herself would have to sleep on some mattress somewhere (on the floor?).\n\nYou know what, you say your daughter is the youngest but it sounds like she's the only one of your kids who lives by herself. Your two sons I assume are older but somehow both still live at home. Seeing as they already live with you and MIL, how about you promise your sons will take turns driving MIL to her social appointments? That way she can remain living with you (as it sounds like you have space) and your two sons get to help out too :).", "YTA. Did you really think you were fooling anyone with the \"let's try it out for a few days\" approach? Your title is misleading too.", "YTA! You volunteered/told your daughter to take her Grandma on as a roommate under the guise of it being temporary when it\u2019s seems like you want her to move away from your home. \n\n**She is 30 yrs old and you are asking her to put her life on hold to be her Grandma\u2019s roommate?!**\n\nI love my Grandma but I don\u2019t want to live with her! I imagine she hung up on you so she wasn\u2019t disrespectful to you!", "YTA - why wouldn\u2019t you talk to your daughter first? Why would you assume a young adult would be okay being a caretaker for her grandmother? \n\nYou could have looked into transportation options for her or senior apartments in the area, instead you decided it was your daughter\u2019s job. Total asshole move.", "I\u2019m struggling to believe this is real, but ok. Yes of course Yta. Maybe what you did wasn\u2019t so bad, but you executed in the wrong order. You see, when you\u2019re trying to pull this off you (1) ASK THE PERSON WHOSE HOME IT IS. *Then* (2) you tell MIL it\u2019s an option. If it is. Instead you promised it to MIL and asked if it was possible afterward. This very clearly means Yta. \n\nYou do not own the world. Your jurisdiction doesn\u2019t extend to your daughters house. You totally screwed this up. \n\nAlso what do you mean \u2018put a mattress out\u2019? Like, on the floor in the middle of her living room? Can MIL get down to the floor without trouble? She\u2019s 82. This sounds\u2026 not workable.", "YTA. Because you can\u2019t choose a straightforward story. Title says \u201cfor a few days\u201d but post says \u201cfor a while\u201d. It\u2019s one thing if you ask for a weekend and are responsible for her return to normal living but a completely different thing if you say \u201ctry living there for a while\u201d. So what is it\u2026.a weekend or a new living situation?\n\nIf you had said \u201ccan you let grandma stay with you for a friday - monday to catch up with friends? it would make her happy!\u201d then I can see NTA. But the way you describe it, you dropped an indefinite living situation onto her.", "YTA. No singleton living their best life in the city wants their grandma sleeping on their living room floor. What were you thinking?", "> I asked MIL if she'd want to move in with my daughter so she can see her friends more often. MIL liked the idea and even seems excited.\n\nYou had no business doing that.  You should have asked your daughter first and then respected her decision.  Not only have you caused a rift in your relationship with your daughter, you may have also caused an issue between your daughter and her grandmother.\n\nYTA.  You don't get to decide who lives with your daughter. Stop trying to dump your responsibilities on her.", "YTA.  You don't get to offer someone else's house up.  Why the hell would you think that's ok?  Tbh it sounds like you're just trying to unload your MIL onto someone else.\n\nYour MIL isn't her responsibility.", "YTA\n\nlmfao!!! \"I asked my MIL if she wanted to live with my daughter\"... Right off the rip you're a giant ah. You don't go around asking someone like that without even thinking of speaking to the person that would potentially taking them in first. The moment that thought popped into your head, your first call/email/text should have been to your daughter. \n\nThe fact that you claim to not understand why she's mad is laughable. I mean really???? Also.... Where is it stipulated that children are obligated/required/expected to \"help out with the family\" once they move out??? Your daughter has ZERO responsibility to your MIL. \n\nFYI: There's a BIG difference between loving your grandparents and wanting to share your home with them. Especially at 30.... Your daughter likely wants to come and go as she pleases... Not look after your MIL cause you're too lazy.", "You offered to your daughter's home to your MIL without asking your daughter first and you wonder why she's mad? And you don't want your MIL around in your house because she's disruptive and difficult, but don't understand why your daughter might not want her either? Wow. YTA and it's hard to wrap my brain around that you don't already know why. I bet there are very good reasons your daughter \"barely does anything to help out with the family anyways\" and I bet they are rooted in how you treat her. Ouch.", "YTA You offered your daughter\u2019s space to your MIL without consulting your daughter first. That space was never yours to offer in the first place.", "YTA. You think an 82-year-old woman wants to sleep on the floor? Or are you paying your daughter's rent to make up for your daughter sleeping on the floor?", "You\u2019re looking for a way to get rid of her\u2026 pay for a hotel room for your MIL, or an apartment in the city\u2026.. yta", "YTA. You made what your MiL is going to see as a promise without clearing it with your daughter, first. You've put her in an impossible position. No young woman is going to want her GRANDMOTHER as a roommate in a one-bedroom apartment, but now if she says 'no', she'll hurt her grandmother's feelings and look like the bad guy. OTOH, if she says 'yes', that's the end of her sex and dating life. You suck.", "YTA- you dont tell someone they can go live with another person without talking to that person first.", "My mil did this to me, except she invited my BIL to live with us. I was pregnant with my daughter. BIL SA'd his sister for years and is overall just an unsavory character. He got a one way train ticket to our place. He had phone sex on my couch every night while jerking it. He drank disgusting amounts of choc milk. And with out fail, every morning I had to use the only bath room to get ready- He would be taking a 1 hour hot shower. \n\n\n He lived with us for a month and was an absolute burden. I moved out and almost divorced my husband over it. \n\n YTA. For so many reasons.", "YTA. Are you asking your daughter to  give up her space to sleep on a mattress in her own home or are asking your 82 MIL to sleep on an air mattress on the floor? Either way, you are AH. \n\nYou floated the plan to MIL before getting permission from the person who's home it is. You're not only the AH, but you're also a moron. You have no idea as to what clauses regarding visitors (long term and other) are in her lease. Her moving MIL could violate her lease and lead to an eviction. No one wants that on their record. \n\nCan't say I blame her for keeping her distance from you and the rest of your family if everything is transactional like this.", "Your daughter has an apartment.  I'm assuming she is renting and has a lease?\n\nIf so, she can't \"just move someone in\".\n\nYou told your mother about your plan before you even talked with your daughter, so now there is pressure on your daughter from your mother.\n\nYTA", "YTA - why would you pitch the idea to your MIL before talking to your daughter?!? It sounds like you ambushed her with this and tried to force it in her. Your MIL is not your daughter\u2019s problem to fix, it is yours.", "YTA. \n\nYou volunteered someone else's home to your MIL, without first consulting them. Then you're just like \"Well just put out a mattress, somewhere, because I have decided you have enough room!\" \n\nWhy don't you, I don't know, engage with your MIL at home? Take her to activities in your area. She can't possibly be the only 82yo in a 5 mile radius.", "You should have asked your daughter first. Would you like being volunteered like this? YTA.", "You can not actually expect us to believe this is an innocent situation. \n\nThe way that you write this post it is dripping with disdain for your MIL. You don\u2019t just \u201cremember\u201d that you have a kid who has moved away and is living alone - I am sure you were priming your MIL in the hopes that she would be able to help manipulate your daughter into saying yes. From your comment of \u201cher whole day has been disruptive\u201d it leads me to believe that she is having some issues - again it sounds like you and your wife signed up for this and not your daughter.\n\nAlso what person tries to have an elderly person sleep on a floor mattress? Unless you are trying to say daughter give up your room give it to MIL since I am tired of dealing with her.\n\nThe sleeping arrangement conversation sounds like your daughter has a one bedroom or a studio apartment.\n\nEither way you are a HUGE AH for so many reasons, including how you talk about MIL and try to offload her to your daughter and then have a surprise pikachu face when she says no - come on be better. Don\u2019t be surprised when your daughter goes NC with you for how you are behaving.", "YTA.  You should have asked your daughter before you voluntold her home and got her grandmother excited.  Plus \"living there for a while\" is very different than a \"few days\" visit.  It sounds like you hate your MIL living with you and are trying to pawn her off on someone else.", "YTA - the poor girl is probably running for the hills.    I loved my grandmother too but there's no way I'd ever want to live with her.    This sounds more like a con job to convince her to do it and that 'try it' was a trap.    You were out of line to tell the MIL about it before you had the daughter's agreement.", "INFO: Are you paying your daughter's rent and bills?\n\nIf the answer to that question is NO (which I assume it is or you would have put that in your post as one of your excuses) then:\n\nYTA - For multiple reasons:\n\n1. You don't ask someone if they want to move into someone else's place before asking the person of that said place.\n   1. Since you have done this, you put your daughter in a super awkward position because now if she says no she's seen as a bad guy to her grandmother for not wanting her around. But that was probably your intention, right?\n2. You said that they can just put a bed on the floor for her, and in a comment you say she has loft bed so the extra mattress can just go underneath. Really, bro? I'm not sure of your MIL's health but most 82 year old people are going to have a hard time getting out of a bed laying on a floor. And if you don't expect her to sleep there then you expect your daughter to give her bed which is also an asshole move.\n3. Why would you think it was a good idea to even go to your MIL about this idea when you knew that your daughter didn't have an extra bedroom?\n4. There's 4 people that live in your house to help with your MIL. Why is it that your grand idea is to have her move in with your daughter, who you didn't ask, instead of someone in the house just taking her into the city to see her friends once a week or so? Or look into senior citizen centers that do activities around where you live? Or just do activities with her yourselves to get her out of the house?\n5. You're selfish and didn't think about your daughter in this at all. You really think that a 30 year old that lives alone wants her grandmother to move in? There goes her social, dating, and personal life. \n\n> She loves her grandma, and my daughter barely does anything to help out with the family anyways, and it would let MIL see her friends.\n\n* You can love someone and not want them living with you.\n* If it's true that she never does anything to help out (which I'm sorry but it's not a requirement to help family, especially if they are selfish and always wanting something), then what made you think \"hhhhmmmm you know let's ask MIL if she wants to move in with daughter, because daughter would definitely want this and want to help us out\"? \n* MIL could also see her friends if you or your wife took her to see them, or you could just tell your MIL your son's are taking her without asking them and try to force them to do some shit like you are to their sister.", "YTA-and let me guess. This is also your MILs home that you live in?", "YTA. so self-righteous for the one who\u2019s trying to pawn off the family they chose\u2026\n\nMaking promises for someone else is such a gross thing for anyone to do; shows others how self-involved you are that you would put your mil\u2019s feelings and your daughter\u2019s comfort so far below your own wants.", "YTA\nOP\nYou don't get it. Your daughter moved out. She has her own life with its own responsibilities. She loves her grandma, but knows she has no time or inclination to care for an elderly person.", "YTA. Let MIL try out one of the suites rather than volunteering to off-load her on your daughter", "Yta. The proper thing to do would be to ask your daughter BEFORE  asking your MIL.

If my MIL went to stay with her for \u201ca few days\u201d so that she could visit her friends, then where is my daughter going to sleep?

My daughter works as a homehelp for various elderly clients plus does night shifts (11pm to 7am) at a petrol station 5 miles away 2 days a week meaning that she needs to sleep some days. She can\u2019t sleep in the living room if MIL is awake and pottering about (to get to the bathroom or the kitchen means going through the living room from the bedroom). The house is heated by a wood burner IN THE LIVING ROOM - so even more disruption just lighting the boiler.\n\nNice idea mum, especially as my daughter lives halfway between us and my MIL\u2019s friends - sounds good on the face of it, but totally unworkable in real life.\n\nYTA - pay for your MIL to stay in an AirBnB for the weekend so that she can see her friends and give you a break. but do NOT expect your daughter to have her grandma staying with her. it just aint going to work.", "YTA.\n\n\"She spends most of the day at home either getting in the way of chores or watching TV.\"\n\nI feel like you just don't want to deal with her anymore, so you volunteered your daughter.", "This post must be sarcasm \ud83e\udd23 YTA", "YTA. Once your daughter said no, that was the answer. And you should have asked her first before saying anything to MIL. It is very reasonable for someone in a 1-bedroom apartment to not want overnight guests. It's also pretty obvious that it's not just an air mattress. You're not considering getting MIL her own apartment or a hotel for a few nights, and you're obviously finding her too much in your space at your home, which is presumably larger than your daughter's.

Recently, my MIL has had trouble meeting her friends in the city, and her whole day has been disruptive. She spends most of the day at home either getting in the way of chores or watching TV.
