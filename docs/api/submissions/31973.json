My cousin (26F), let's call her Sarah, has been pestering me to be a bridesmaid ever since I got engaged. However, I've decided not to include her in my bridal party, and now it's causing quite an uproar in the family.\r  \n\r  \nHere's some background: When I was 19, I became a single mom unexpectedly. It was a challenging time, and I had to navigate parenthood while juggling college and work. Sarah wasn't supportive at all and made hurtful comments about my situation, shaming me for being a young single mom. Her words were harsh and deeply affected me during a vulnerable period of my life. And it really hurt me as  I considered her as an older sister. I had 3 amazing friends around me all the time helping with expenses, babysitting, taking me out etc. and one of those friends is now my fiance. \r  \n\r  \nFast forward to now. I'm happily engaged to an amazing partner, planning my wedding, and trying to mend relationships within my family. Sarah recently approached me, assuming she'd be a bridesmaid, and I had to break the news that I had already chosen my bridal party. She was furious and demanded an explanation.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't bring myself to tell her the real reason: her hurtful comments from the past. Instead, I just mentioned that I had already made commitments to other friends and family members. Sarah hasn't taken this well and has been telling everyone in the family that I'm excluding her for no reason, painting me as the bad guy.\r  \n\r  \nMy family is now insisting that I quiet the drama by just including her but I don't want to, she knows I am planning a week-long trip with my bridesmaids who are just my two friends ( fiance doing the same with his boys) and I feel it's the only reason she actually approached me again when I told my aunt this she called me an asshole saying that Sarah was family and deserved more than my friends\r  \n\r  \nSo am I the asshole for not wanting Sarah as a bridesmaid due to her past behavior, even though it's causing family tension? Or should I just give in to keep the peace?", "created_utc": 1701259290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186nt5h/aita_for_not_wanting_my_cousin_as_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't deserve to be a bridesmaid after the way she's treated you", "NTA. Tell them the real reason, and see if they're still supportive of her.", "NTA. You get to choose who your bridesmaids are, and even if Sarah was still one of your favorite people you are still not obligated to choose her as a bridesmaid. The fact that she bullied you means she definitely doesn't deserve to be one. However, I do think you should tell her the reason why (even though I'm sure she already knows) so she can't keep claiming that you excluded her \"for no reason\". If she tries to keep telling people that, you can just reply, \"Actually, the reason I'm not including her is because she has made many horrible comments and shamed me for being a single mother, and I don't want someone like that beside me on my wedding day\".", "NTA\n\nBut I think you should tell her the truth about why she's not included\nOr at least tell your family the truth and it might filter back to her \n\nActions do have consequences, please stand your ground and maybe she might take a lesson from this", "NTA, tell her and your family the real reason.

Your family can support and be glad for your happiness, including your cousin, or not. And I'd tell them exactly that way. \n\nBut you might consider saying the backstory. That might reduce the outrage. And can hardly make your relationship with your cousin worse, so why not."]}
