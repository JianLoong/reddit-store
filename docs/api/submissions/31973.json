My cousin (26F), let's call her Sarah, has been pestering me to be a bridesmaid ever since I got engaged. However, I've decided not to include her in my bridal party, and now it's causing quite an uproar in the family.\n\nHere's some background: When I was 19, I became a single mom unexpectedly. It was a challenging time, and I had to navigate parenthood while juggling college and work. Sarah wasn't supportive at all and made hurtful comments about my situation, shaming me for being a young single mom. Her words were harsh and deeply affected me during a vulnerable period of my life. And it really hurt me as  I considered her as an older sister. I had 3 amazing friends around me all the time helping with expenses, babysitting, taking me out etc. and one of those friends is now my fiance.\n\nFast forward to now. I'm happily engaged to an amazing partner, planning my wedding, and trying to mend relationships within my family. Sarah recently approached me, assuming she'd be a bridesmaid, and I had to break the news that I had already chosen my bridal party. She was furious and demanded an explanation.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to tell her the real reason: her hurtful comments from the past. Instead, I just mentioned that I had already made commitments to other friends and family members. Sarah hasn't taken this well and has been telling everyone in the family that I'm excluding her for no reason, painting me as the bad guy.\n\nMy family is now insisting that I quiet the drama by just including her but I don't want to, she knows I am planning a week-long trip with my bridesmaids who are just my two friends ( fiance doing the same with his boys) and I feel it's the only reason she actually approached me again when I told my aunt this she called me an asshole saying that Sarah was family and deserved more than my friends\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting Sarah as a bridesmaid due to her past behavior, even though it's causing family tension? Or should I just give in to keep the peace?\n\nEdit with a bit of an update : ( it's 8/51pm in my country) Thx so much for all your comments, my fiance actually read this post since we share the account and shared it with our group and close family group. he told me word for word: \"Sit back and I'll handle it\" cause tonight we are having the whole family over for a big dinner  \n\nmore info: the special party would take place the night of the wedding, me and fiance, as well as the whole group, are very very very nerdy, geeky, call it what you want but we are the cliche of the Big Bang theory boys, so I always planned that after everything official and normal we would stay in the venue, lose the dresses and tuxes, get in pajamas and play DND, video games, anime songs karaoke", "created_utc": 1701259290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186nt5h/aita_for_not_wanting_my_cousin_as_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're planning a small wedding party, so it isn't like you have 5 girl cousins and only four are invited.   \n\n\nAlso, if your cousin would not fit into the geeky friends group, that's another reason. But seriously, just keep planning your wedding and if asked just emphasize that it is a small wedding party and that you are including your cousin and the family in the wedding and reception. This will blow over and be forgotten.", "Just keep repeating \u201c I\u2019ve already picked my Bridesmaids, thanks\u201d\n\n\u201c You\u2019re welcome to have her as a bridesmaid if you\u2019d like, I\u2019ve already picked mine. Thanks.\u201d", "ESH. You're TA because you lack the guys to tell your cousin the truth.  Your cousin is TA for insisting to be in a bridal party where she's not wanted.  Put your big girl panties on and tell your cousin the truth.", "NTA, but you\u2019re being an asshole to yourself by not telling her the real reason\u2026..", "NTA. We don\u2019t negotiate with emotional terrorists.", "NTA\n\nI had my cousins as bridesmaids and still didn\u2019t expect to be theirs and I wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t care! It\u2019s personal to you! I had 8 bridesmaids that were my sister, friends and cousins because I wanted a lot whereas one cousin had only friends and the other had a sister and a friend! \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding she just wants the gifts also it\u2019s a supportive role and she has proven she is anything but supportive!\n\nYou do you!", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your choices. WHY would you want someone that obnoxious involved in your wedding? She sounds awful and also like she'd be the type to mock your choices after the event if she was involved. Weddings can be nerve-wracking enough without having to deal with the stress of an entitled, judgemental bitch in the works.", "Sounds like Cousin only got the bug up her nose when she heard of the fun times you were footing the bill for.\n\nNTA.\n\nTell the family in a group text why you made this choice.  Please ask anyone if they disagree with your logic.  Let them know that you don\u2019t understand why, in the face of such cruelty, that they might consider requiring that you invite someone who does not truly wish her well.", "What\u2019s the matter with the truth?\nShe should be a bridesmaid for someone she doesn\u2019t gossip about and criticize. That\u2019s would be more fun for her. \nHold firm.", "NTA - but you should tell your cousin and the rest of the family why. \n\n\"When I became a single mom unexpectedly Sarah wasn't supportive at all and made hurtful comments about my situation, and also shamed me for being a young single mom. Her words were harsh and deeply affected me during a vulnerable period of my life. I received emotional and financial support from my close friends who are now my fiance and the two bridesmaids. Sarah didn't respect me then and she isn't respecting me now, continuing to criticize me and bully me rather than be happy for my choices. You are all invited to my wedding, including Sarah, to celebrate a milestone in my life.   I've made up my mind and this is not up for discussion.  I hope you all will understand and will be at the wedding.\"", "NTA. If I could make a suggestion\u2013your wedding party is there to help you with stuff like this. Deputize one of your bridesmaids to explain the situation to her, and if need be to your family as well. You're the bride, no need to stress about this!", "Nta and omg can I DM your D&D after party?! I have a wedding mystery module!", "You're only the asshole for not telling the truth...ask your fianc\u00e9e to borrow his balls for a few hours...it's YOUR wedding!", "NTA - I know that it's really painful and hard to become vulnerable and tell someone to their face, \"You hurt me.\"  But she's continuing to hurt you.  I think you need to let it slip to a few people who ask, exactly why you're not including her.  She's toxic.  And maybe she needs to be uninvited to the wedding unless she shuts her trap.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably tell your family and your cousin the reason.", "Agreed. Definitely NTA, but holding back OP's reasoning (feelings) is just allowing Sarah's story to go unchallenged. \n\nOP had challenges, and it seems you've succeeded (happiness). It makes 100% sense to have special kinship/celebration for those who were there for OP.\n\nCongrats to the OP, btw.", "Agree nta-  the only thing you\u2019ve done wrong is not explain why. Now you don\u2019t owe an explanation but a bit like ripping the band aid off- it might have caused a bit more uncomfortableness upfront but at least being honest would have been definitive and stopped the ongoing drama", "Agree she should\u2019ve just straight up told her cousin that she was anything but supportive when she was struggling, so she guesses she wasn\u2019t all that important to the cousin. \n\nI also completely understand how difficult it is to tell domineering, entitled assholes to stay in their lane, especially when you\u2019re young and it might be one of the first times you\u2019ve stood up for yourself. \n\nHow I wish I could tell my younger self that it\u2019s okay to tell people trampling all over you to fuck all the way off, especially when they expect you to bend over and take it again. \n\nOP, tell anyone who\u2019s offended that you\u2019ve made your decision, and you\u2019ll be adjusting your RSVPs to reflect a \u2018no\u2019 for anyone who doesn\u2019t like the thought of you having peace at your own wedding, and sorry, but this includes family. Stomp the boundary crushers now, while you\u2019re young, and give yourself the gift of a lifetime. \n\nCongratulations, sending wishes for a lovely day and a lifetime of love.", "[removed]", "Maybe OP could do this in two parts:\n\nTalk to the cousin in private and be honest about not feeling close to her since she was hurtful and unsupportive when you were having a hard time on your own with a baby. Even if she's grown up since then (doesn't sound like it from her entitled tantrum), the damage was done and the closeness is gone. You've found your chosen family.\n\nThen give her a choice. Either she backs down and supports your choice of wedding party, or you go public with your explanation.\n\nShe will choose the latter, since her greed for the after party fuels her sense of entitlement. And she'll play the victim, either denying or justifying her treatment of you.\n\nThis will serve as a very clear blueprint of which family members to keep in your life going forward and which to hold at a polite arm's length. Weddings are good for that sort of filtering. It will make the event a bit drama-full, but your future will be so much better for knowing who the landmines are among your friends and relatives.\n\n(edited to correct a word)", "It's long overdue for some truth telling. You need to talk to your cousin about how hurtful her judgemental behavior was to you.\n\nYou have nothing to lose- she's already wanting to fight you. So you might as well try to get at the heart of it.", "This is fantastic advice!  If Sarah is determined to tell everyone in the family about her perceived slight, then she should also have to answer for her part in it. It\u2019s very kind of you that you didn\u2019t want to point out how poorly she treated you in the past, but her actions have shown that she doesn\u2019t deserve your kindness. Take control of the narrative so that your family gets off your back!", "The only reason I haven't told her directly is i hate confrontation I tend to rage or cry and not control what i say anymore.   \nyes the two friends and my fiance and my parents and siblings ( too young but are my flower girl and boy) were the only one there for me full time.", "I agree with the thrust of what you\u2019re saying but not with your choice of words: \u2018thing you have done wrong\u2019. Why such strong language?", "So send her an email. Speak truthfully saying what you wrote here and using I statements. I was hurt when this happened\u2026and then tell your family that it\u2019s not up for debate.", "Well, now consider this a lesson learned. NOT telling her resulted in bigger confrontation and drama.\n\nGo tell her.", "You have to man up on this one OP and explain to your family and cousin why. It will feel good to get it off your chest and maybe help your cousin realize that you can\u2019t be mean to people and expect favor. And your family only siding with her because they don\u2019t know the real reason. It\u2019s your wedding your choice don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.", "NTA but you should really tell your family how you feel and why your cousin is not in the wedding party. You\u2019re being painted as the bad guy when it\u2019s totally reasonable to say something like \u201cMy wedding party is made up of the people who supported me during difficult times in my life, at one time that could have been Cousin but when I was a struggling single mother she decided to criticize and make hurtful comments instead. She\u2019s allowed to express her opinion and make these comments but I am also allowed to be hurt by them and I was. This is why she was not included in my wedding party.\u201d Because truly your wedding party should be people who love and support you and your soon to be spouse and want to join in celebration your union.", "Then plan for it. Know what you\u2019re going to say. Practice ahead of time. Have exactly three examples (no more, no less) of things she did that hurt you.", "Because I\u2019m a judgemental asshole and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here! \n\nFair enough challenge - I guess because lying about why she wasn\u2019t invited kept the door open to having her mind changed and meant cousin didn\u2019t have to confront past actions- but agree maybe \u2018could have done better\u2019 is fairer?", "that's really well-put! OP should consider sending this as a message to her family members.", "She didn\u2019t lie. She correctly told that she had already selected the bridesmaids. She may not have given the full story but she didn\u2019t lie. Rather than calling her out for having done something \u2018wrong\u2019, one could suggest that telling the bad apple why she was excluded may have led to clearing the air. Her choice to my mind.", "Is your cousin one of your special, supportive, close personal friends?\n\nNo? Then why on Earth would she or anyone expect you to include her as a bridesmaid? I'm having trouble wrapping my head around that one. And why would she even want to be what?  It makes no sense at all to me. It'd be just as likely to ask some rando on the street to be a bridesmaid as you would her. Madness.\n\nNTA", ">the special party would take place the night of the wedding, me and fiance, as well as the whole group, are very very very nerdy, geeky, call it what you want but we are the cliche of the Big bang theory boys, so I always planned that after everything official and normal we would stay in the venue, lose the dresses and tuxes, get in pajamas and play DND, video games, anime songs karaoke\n\nUm, do you need an honorary Auntie and Uncle? We have played WOW for ages and my husband loves DnD :-D\n\nYou are NTA, its your wedding, not a score keeping exercise. Have the people who love and support you stand up and the rest can pound sand.", "NTA Agree with all of the comments that it is YOUR WEDDING. I would have a conversation with the bridal party as it is now asking them to not share any more about the inner workings of the wedding plans. I would talk to your parents and ask them to stand up for you and stop the madness that is the spoiled child Sarah and that you will not talk about it or justify your decision any more and you expect that they will support you. Do not give this person one more minute of your life - every minute you spend thinking about her is one less you get to focus on the happiness you have found.", "NTA. you need to tell the cuz why though. nah actually tell everyone!! also those big band theory cats where creepy weirdos. find a difference group to reference me thinks lol \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  It is your wedding.  You choose who you like to be bridesmaids.", "Your cousin is an AH. Give her 1 clue. Her wedding she should feel totally free to choreograph etc any way she likes. Your wedding, she should back the fuck off.", "OP that after-party sounds amazing.  I hope you have a wonderful wedding and a fantastic party.  Please don't add someone you don't trust to such a beautiful plan.  NTA", "The only thing that makes you YTA in this situation is avoiding the truth. I mean, you can feel bad for lying, you can feel bad for hiding the truth, but you can never feel bad for being honest. Your omission is what is causing this drama. Also, did you consider the fact that if you told her the truth it gives her the opportunity to make amends? To understand how much she hurt you?  Give her a chance to grow at least, but based on the reasoning then you don't have to let her in the bridal party - but at least you don't look like the AH. Go tell her why you excluded her and tell the rest of your family. Stop hiding the truth - it hurts you the most.", "NTA But I really don't see your problem to be more straughtforward and tell her she wasn't a good friend to you. For a more PC version use \"I chose my most supportive group of people a my bridal party\"", "NTA, but for heaven's sake, take a deep breath and be honest with her and your family.  Your bridal party are those who have proven themselves true friends when you were vulnerable and in need while your cousin was not only not helpful, but was hurtful.\n\nWho knows - your cousin might even learn that actions have consequences.", "Sarah is causing the drama in the family, not you.\n\nI don't understand everyone wanting to be bridesmaids.  I've been a bridesmaid more times than I remember, and for the last bridesmaid invitation the first thing out of my mouth was \"You know I love you, but please don't make me be a bridesmaid.  I hate it so much.\"  Then she and I both laughed and she said okay, I was off the hook.", "NTA.  Frankly the fact that your cousin can't fathom why you might not want her, compounded by this pressure campaign, is proof in the pudding just why she shouldn't be.  Good luck OP!", "NTA\n\nUltimately, it's your bridal party, you get to decide who is in it, simple as that. And no one else gets a say.\n\nBut you talk about \"trying to mend relationships within my family.\" You sound like you were pretty close to Sarah at one point - do you *want* to get close to her again? If you do, you need to leave the rest of the family out of it and sit down and have am honest, one on one conversation, just you and her. There's plenty of growth that can occur between 21 and 26!", "Nta your wedding g your choice of who you want around you on your big day. End of story tell family the truth why you don't want her as your bridesmaid she proved she can't be there for you therefore isn't bridesmaid material", "NTA\n\nMaybe instead of saying \u201cit\u2019s because you were hurtful\u201d you can provide explanation as \u201cthese friends were really there for me when I most needed it, and were alongside fianc\u00e9 for that, so they\u2019re standing up for both of us at the wedding.\u201d It\u2019s not a lie, and it\u2019s more gentle than giving the whole truth. Most weddings have an equal number of bridesmaids and groomsmen, so you can also put the blame on him for not being able to add an extra (\u201coh he really just wants the two guys on his side\u201d).", "I NEED to know what happened at the dinner.  NTA.", "NTA. But for goodness sakes, tell her that you did not appreciate her insulting comments when you were pregnant. And actions have consequences. And honestly how did she not notice you going from best buddies to just cousins?", "Ugh. It is so tacky to ask to be a bridesmaid. The bride chooses. NTA.", "I mean I'm a bitch, so I would have straight up asked why cousin would want to be my bridesmaid when she thinks I'm \"start throwing her words from years earlier back at her\" life is sometimes easier when you're a bitch, know it and embrace it at a comfortable level.", "NTA, it's your wedding and you make the choices that fit you best.\n\nI do believe that you will need to come clean with your cousin after the wedding and things have calmed down a bit. She will not like it but it needs to be said as there'll be other special occasions (maybe another kiddo in the future?) where you won't chose your cousin and this will happen all over again.", "NTA your second reception sounds awesome!", "!updateme", "NTA. Tell Sarah exactly why she\u2019s not a bridesmaid in front of the family. The entitlement of some people needs to be publicly excised from them.", "Your explanation was flawless. Chef\u2019s kiss.", "OMg i wish I was in the same country as yall ! if you have one do you mind sharing in message?", "You get to call the shots. End of story.", "Ah, thank you! I find if I write things out, I am much more logical and eloquent than when I try to verbally express myself. All that adrenaline and pesky emotions. \ud83e\udd23", "Write a letter, send an email, explain on FB. No need to confront. Doing this will also insures you don\u2019t have to deal with the immediate crying and denial talk.", "Seriously, that was *absolutely perfect.* I don't think it would be possible to say it any better.", "I\u2019m good at taking other people\u2019s words and \u201ctranslating\u201d them into more \u201cprofessional\u201d language.
