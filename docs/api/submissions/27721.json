You deserve all the things you want. Don\u2019t settle for someone that can\u2019t even give you one of those things. You DESERVE IT ALL. And if that means being on your own for a while, so be it. Once you\u2019ve left him, treat yourself. Go on dates, finish your schooling, focus on yourself. You\u2019re a wonderful woman who deserves wonderful things. You can do it! :)", "NTA\n\nYou should take a moment to ask yourself if this relationship is worth it or if it can get better, because it's not worth it right now.\n\nIt's time to start sharing the household chores equally.", "How about when he takes out the trash, you recommend he put himself in there? \n\nBut seriously. What are you doing? Please. Just end this relationship. \n\nNTA.", "NTA I definitely thought I'd rule the other way when I read the title.

You both feel as if you\u2019re putting more into the relationship than you get out of it.\n\nI mean, you clearly feel that way.  And he\u2019s telling you that he feels that way.  Your response was to blow him up and tell him how much he doesn\u2019t deserve to feel like that.\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one who is allowed to have feelings.", "NAH.

He might be one of those people who doesn't really see studying at home for a doctoral degree as actual 'work' and therefore in his head you must have loads of free time for chores.\n\nYou mentioned he has been unemployed for stretches, he may be depressed.\n\nYou on the other hand are clearly resentful and add up as a tally in your head your getting up and making breakfast that you feel are not being reciprocated.\n\nHe is unlikely to change and you can expect more of the same if you do have children.\n\nYou need to decide if you want the relationship because if you do, need counseling.", "NAH. You both value different things. Stop doing things for him that he doesn't tell you are important. So many women talk about all they do that isn't appreciated. If it's not appreciated, don't do it. I bet some things he'll miss and some he won't. Restart the things he missed if he expresses appreciation of some kind. \n\nDon't continue to do things for other people because *you* think they are important, unless you're willing to have others take those things for granted. If you'd mind those things taken for granted, then don't do them when they aren't appreciated. \n\nNot so simple in practice because it's hard to know ahead of time what's actually going to be appreciated. So, by the time you realize there's a disconnect, you're already frustrated. But if you don't reset expectations, you'll just continue operating on different sets of assumptions.", "NTA\n\nUsual couple fight.\n\nTo me, your husband is stressed from his unemployment and take on you.\n\nJust cool down.\n\nTake care", "Your feelings might be valid, but that doesn't mean you should dismiss your partner's.

It takes two to keep a marriage going but, if things are as you say, neither of you seem to be invested and happy enough to turn things around. I'm sorry. There are just times when you call it and move on, as much as it hurts. If your partner is feeling emasculated, depressed, or frustrated, they have to put in the work. You can shake those pom poms and cheer them on but how do you cheer when you yourself are depleted? You need to save something for yourself and child so you can find peace, satisfaction, and joy and build on that foundation. Be good to yourself.", "Leave him.
