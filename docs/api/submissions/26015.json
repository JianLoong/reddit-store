First suggesting that your fianc\u00e9 would leave you and then calling you fat?  No way.\n\nI'm trying to understand on what planet this is ok unless this is how she always behaves.

I don\u2019t know why your mom felt it necessary to say hateful things, but leaving was appropriate.

You did not overreact at all.  Getting up and leaving was your way of ending her bullying without making a scene.  You did nothing wrong.  She is definately the AH.", "NTA\n\nYour Mum however is, how bloody insulting. \n\nSounds like you and your Fianc\u00e9 were insulted and your Dad and Sister were very embarrassed. \n\nShe needs to apologise not only to you and your Fianc\u00e9 but also to your Sis and Dad.", "NTA. If you're interested in continuing to have her in your life, you should speak to her 1:1 and tell her how she made you feel. Apologize for leaving dinner abruptly but state the intention of your conversation at the beginning. Be clear-headed, write down what you want to say to her in advance and keep a calm demeanor. Explain to her that she cannot speak to you that way and lay out clear boundaries for your relationship in the future. \n\nIf you're not interested in having a close relationship with her, then she can go to hell.", "NTA - everyone knew your mom's comments were mean and in poor taste.  The only thing I would have suggested would be to address your mom's behavior directly before leaving, but I think you are good.  It doesn't sound like your dad or sister are upset about it, so don't feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is an AH though.", "Those weren't jokes. It was just your mom being TA.

Didn't anyone teach mother dearest that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all? Her comments were rude and distasteful.

Did she think she was being funny?  \n\nShe says YOU spoiled the atmosphere?   *Guess what, mom, YOU were the one who spoiled the atmosphere with your incredibly rude and hurtful words - and EVERYONE at the table knows it*", "My mom's a bully too. Sorry friend.", "OP - those are not jokes. Your mother is just plain mean. Nothing was funny. \n\nNTA!\n\nI will be honest with you - my late MIL said some really awful things to me and if she had said stuff like that to me before we were married (and I was in a better place emotionally) I think I would have had second thoughts about choosing to be part of that family.\n\nIt's awesome that your fiance had your back - but don't let this just sit. Have a conversation about it. My own family is ALSO pretty terrible and my now-husband needed to take a tiny bit of breathing room after witnessing a nasty fight between me and my sister (and having my sister openly hit on him). We both went into our marriage knowing we came from troubled, dysfunctional families and we are mostly no contact or very low contact with them at this point. His parents are deceased, my mom has dementia, and our siblings continue to be awful and difficult and unhelpful.", "NTA- you aren't obligated to take that abuse from anyone, not even your mom.", "NTA. Your mom was out of line.", "NTA...  Your mom's a dick...", "YTA.

You should never have to feel sorry for not taking someone's shit with a smile. You did what you could do best in that situation and walked away.

She\u2019s verbally abusive!!!", "NTA\n\nDoes she have a history of behaving like that towards you?", "If OP paid him back and kept to their word, why are they the AH?", "NTA and my mom pulled this shit with me, the situation was so close to yours that I find myself getting mad all over again. Best thing I ever did was put my foot down with her and set boundaries.", "YTA. You should've not invited your mother if you couldn't handle her personality and you were already 23 years old. Stop being so childish and leaving the dinner just because of your mom's words.", "When someone offers to buy me dinner, I don't figure they mean they'll pay me back for it three days later.\n\nAlso, by 23, daughters have their mom's figured out. She knew her mom was a bully, she offered to buy dinner despite,  she stormed out when her mom exhibited known tendencies. \n\nYou shouldn't invite a person to dinner, if you can't \"get your big girl pants on\" and tolerate that person.", ">When someone offers to buy me dinner, I don't figure they mean they'll pay me back for it three days later.\n\nWell if I were offering to pay for someone's dinner, I wouldn't expect them to start insulting me out of the blue either. If you're going to meet someone's kindness with cruelty, then you have no right to try to claim that kindness, even if they promised it to you, bc your actions negated that. Maybe OP could have talked to her dad sooner bc he had no part in the insults, but if he's not hurting for the money, I don't think 3 days is really going to affect his budget. \n\n>Also, by 23, daughters have their mom's figured out. She knew her mom was a bully, she offered to buy dinner despite, she stormed out when her mom exhibited known tendencies. \n\nThere are plenty of cases where parents will exhibit new behavior that their kids weren't expecting. Maybe OP's mom only makes those comments at home and never in public before now, or maybe she's reacting out of jealousy for OP going on a trip soon, or this is OP's first serious relationship and now that she has a fiance Mom is struggling to adapt to OP getting ready to get married, or maybe she's been really stressed lately and randomly snapped. You don't know the situation enough to confidently say OP knew she was a bully and should have expected this.\n\nEdit: besides, the fact that OP says mom suddenly thought it would be appropriate to \"make jokes\" has me thinking this *did* surprise-indicating it was sudden rather than saying \"it was about time mom starting making her usual comments\" or something like that makes it sound like this hasn't happened before.", "I admit, you may be right. Keep in mind, there are two sides to every story and this one *feels like* there's a glaring omission or two. For example \"after mom was three glasses of wine in...\" or \"Mom got riled up after I suggested we get our smarts from dad's side of the family...\"\n\nWe get half the pieces of the puzzle on these and are asked to levy a verdict.", "NTA", "NTA.  I didn\u2019t see any jokes.. it might be the I\u2019ll smile and laugh while saying something mean, so it must be a joke person.  Got an Inlaw like that.  Very tiring.", "NTA. That\u2019s messed up. And from your own mother, no less. I hope you get some clear headspace in your trip and that your mom realizes she messed up.", "NTA. How can someone standing up for themself be an Asshole? Good for you.", ">For example \"after mom was three glasses of wine in...\" or \"Mom got riled up after I suggested we get our smarts from dad's side of the family...\"\n\nThat's certainly possible. But without any indication otherwise, I'm going to take her at her word that this happened suddenly, meaning without warning or provocation. There's no comments, so asking for more details is probably pointless anyway."]}
