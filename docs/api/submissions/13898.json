She, like always, out of nowhere started telling me about her wishes for the future (for the 5x time this week). \u201cYeahhh, i want to have money, travel, live an old money life\u2026\u201d blah blah blah\u2026 And I simply asked her: \u201chow do you plan on getting that, if you\u2019re 22 years old, still in a university - failing and skipping classes, constantly on your phone watching tiktoks (her screen time is 6h every day), living on daddy\u2019s money and get upset every time someone mentions, that maybe you could get a part time job, if you\u2019re constantly \u201ccrying\u201d that you\u2019re broke. \n\nShe got really upset and started yelling nonsense at me and i just didn\u2019t listen anymore.\n\nIts not wrong to have big dreams, but you have to do something to achieve them, right? Still, I don\u2019t understand, how does she expect to have great things in life, if she doesn\u2019t put in the work.\n\nUpdate: Its just 6pm right now and she has asked me to take her photos 5 times today. And now she is pissed because: she doesn\u2019t look good in the pictures; i didn\u2019t take my time taking her pictures; i didn\u2019t take her pictures quickly enough and the bird flew away; because i didnt take her pictures with my phone \u2026.\nAnyway now she said, and i quote: \u201cYeah you always fuck up everyones day and their mood with your attitude and rudeness\u201d and then I asked \u201cwdym everyone\u2019s when its just you getting upset because i\u2019m sick and tired of doing things for you?\u201d and she said \u201cyeah but thats not the point\u201d ngl it\u2019s hilarious", "created_utc": 1680515116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12af82c/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_will_never_succeed/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing wrong with a reality check.", "Nta\u2026 just because it stings, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true", "Hell nah you are NTA. I mean it is OK for her to have dreams this big and still not work. This will only affect her. It is her loss if she can\u2019t achieve those dreams. As long as she doesn\u2019t disturb you this is how it is. Everything changes if she always tells you this and takes your time. Since she disturbs you it is a consequence that you tell her your thoughts.", " NTA - this actually made me laugh. You certainly have the right attitude to life. Now go out there and show her how it\u2019s done.", "NTA.\n\nNot really any of your business, but if she really forces you to listen to her cliche dreams this often, you earn a pass to speak your mind.\n\nYour sister sounds super annoying.", "NTA, imo", "NTA. I know people who had that dream. It didn\u2019t turn out well because they were like your sister.", "NTA. If she\u2019s going to keep telling you her wishes, you can give her the reality checks that she needs.", "I mean, Who doesn't want to live that life? \n\nNTA though because you are right.", "NTA. Your sister sounds lazy af.", "NTA. Your sis better not be surprised when you go no contact in the future", "NTA.  Your sister is expecting her 'natural worth' to carry her to her goals.  Problem is, those guys she's after, those 'old money life' people, they don't give a rat fuck about her Tiktoks or Insta reels.  They'd just as soon leave an attitude like your sister's unread than give it their time, effort or money.", "NTA", "NTA You are right, it is okay to have big dreams, but she needs to make positive steps towards making it happen. An education, getting a job and putting money away would be a start.", "NTA. She clearly is hoping for a lottery win or some wealthy partner to scoop her up.", "My brother is the same way and also gets pissy when I say this to him. Only he isn't on tiktok he smokes and plays games and buys overpriced clothes.\n\nNTA\n\nDelusional is delusional. Every dream requires some work, moreso if it is a very very big one like being rich with a hot rich husband.", "NTA. Your poor fool of a sister doesn't understand \"old money\".

Does she suffer from anxiety? Or depression? I wonder if something is going on that is causing her to fail grades, skip class, not get a job. She could simply be lazy, or there could be something more going on (not that that\u2019s a an excuse).", "NTA. I hope she's unrealistically beautiful if she want a big money fella because it doesn't sound like she's got a pretty personality.", "[deleted]", "Nta but my screen time is 12 hours sometimes", "Yta. Dont be surprised if she goes low/no contact", "Secret animosity", "At her age, I suspect you will be living the same life - at college, leaving off Daddy's money, trying to get the academic qualifications to have an independent life. You have set a very high standard for yourself and I suspect she will enjoy watching your struggles to meet it. What is your screen time every day outside of your structured education? Do you work?", "nta", "If it stings, it's probably true", "yeah, on top of all that she always uses me for taking pictures for her and she get\u2019s mad when she doesn\u2019t look good in them", "How? The sister needs to get her shit together.", "happens", "How is OP the asshole for speaking the truth? Your response is idiotic.", "I feel like a delusional gold digger going no contact is a good thing.", "you\u2019re right, i do have really high standards, i\u2019d say my screen time is 2-3hours, i\u2019m still in high school but i at least have the will to work if not anything else i help doing housework (unlike her) and i\u2019m planning of getting a summer job yeah", "For her Sugar Babies profile?  NTA", "Holy cow. Sounds like you are 14 and 16, not like she's an actual adult.\n\nYou should tell her you're done listening to the same thing over and over and that you're done being her photographer. Involve your parents if she throws another hissy fit.\n\nSpeaking of which, they should've kicked her out a while ago. Clearly, living at home isn't doing her any favors.", "Reread it, NTA. Didn't see age lol. Mb.", "[removed]", "I hope you can maintain them but your current screen time is about the same proportion of your free time as her's. And I hope you manage the tasking challenge of balancing work and college. Good luck. Sounds like your sister is struggling a bit with her college - high standards are good but lack of compassion  can also be a hindrance in achieving goals.", "Yeah already tried, and for the speaking with parents part - they just say we\u2019re old enough to solve it on ourselves but that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere now, does it? \n\nAt the end i\u2019m the one who feels bad for not bringing her something or doing something for her, and they just say \u201cbe nice\u201d or \u201cfor once do something nice for her\u2026.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know, maybe when we get a bit older, we\u2019ll go live our separate ways and things will eventually be better?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I don't know how you've tried or what you've said, bit this really should be something for your parents to handle. I hope you've been completely frank about the effect it has on you.\n\nBut if they don't help, you have every right to just tell her to stop talking and you can just get up and leave the room if she won't. And just tell her you're not taking her pictures anymore.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of siblings get closer when they're grownups. So time will help, but not living under the same roof will help even more. My wife and SIL are way closer now than when they were kids. So it'll get better \u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks, i sure hope it will get better", "NTA. We all need a reality check sometimes, and this one gets particularly hard to hear the older you get.\n\nNot to mention an \u201cold money\u201d life requires \u201cold money\u201d or at least normal freshly acquired money. Good thing is you both have plenty of time to create the life of your dreams still.", "NTA, how is she going to meet her prospective old money husband cuz those people hang out amongst themselves & rarely date outside he group.", "Sometimes a little reality check is in order.  NTA.", "I got a lot of respect for you telling your sister the plain and simple truth", "NTA. But I would just end the conversation if it gets annoying and stop taking pictures. \n\nFocus on yourself. At 16 you can start earning money and prepping for tests for college. (You sound like you are in the USA). You can make your life cool and interesting.", "NTA", "Actually i\u2019m from the Balkans hah but thanks. I\u2019m focusing on staying happy in my life rn", "Sometimes stuff like this stings because it feels bad that a person you like/love obviously thinks poorly about you. Someone you\u2019re close to doesn\u2019t need the truth to get under your skin. \n\nBut in the case of OP\u2019s sister, yeah I think you have a point.", "It\u2019s been my experience that the key to success is rarely hard work. My screen time is over 9 hrs/ day because I watch movies at my desk. That\u2019s not a good way to measure productivity. 22 is a normal age to still be in school where I live. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s a big deal. I graduated at 23. A lot of people that age live on daddy\u2019s money if they can. The adult world is expensive. People work full time and still sleep in the car. My part time job during college caused issues with my gpa, sleep quality, and my ability to network on campus, but it was necessary to live. You have a lot of opinion and expectations, but you\u2019re still in high school. Your sister could just be annoying and lazy, or she could still be trying to find her way.", "Yeah, by 22 the stupidity should have diminished significantly if it's just garden variety teenage/young adult stupidity. This sounds like a case of chronic dipshittery with a high chance of progressing towards terminal entitled asshole disease."]}
