I\u2019m physically fit by military standards but because of mental health issues from my service I\u2019m getting discharged. \n\nI haven\u2019t used it until today when I had to pregnant pee asap and made a emergency stop at a store and tried to get as close to the store as I could and made a run for it. When I came back out there was a older gentleman standing near my car. As I approached he asked if I was the woman that just ran into the store. I said yes and he ripped into me about how much of a piece of shit I was for taking a handicapped spot when I was clearly able bodied enough to do a full sprint into the store. He even told me he deserved the spot more than I did because of his age. \n\nI felt really bad because I assumed I took the spot from  a elderly handicapped man and apologized profusely . It was for nothing though since he told me he didn\u2019t have a handicap  placard but compared to me he had more reason to have the spot than I did and that he was tired of  able bodied young people taking advantage of things like this. Dude even asked what disability I had (I refused to answer because it\u2019s a personal) and said he was going to call the police because I\u2019m clearly abusing someone else\u2019s placard. \n\nI\u2019m not going to lie\u2026I\u2019m very sensitive right now and was on the verge of tears and I\u2019m prone to panic attacks because of the ptsd. I told him I\u2019d get the documents for the placard to prove it\u2019s mine and he said he would still call the cops. I got In my car to pretend to look for the documents (I just really didn\u2019t want to let him see he made me cry) and as I got into the car dude started walking to the front of my to get my plate number. I got hit with a intense urge to run and I just backed out and drove away in a panic. For a guy the deserved the spot more that I did he was healthy enough to run after my car at full speed while trying to stop me. \n\nAITA for making use of my placard? I parked a few blocks away because I was reaching a level of panic that would make it dangerous  for myself and everyone else if I kept going. I am a lot calmer and I feel guilty for even thinking I could use the spot.\n\nEdit\u2026 i was trying to leave out the reasons for my mental health causing physical symptoms that I could be considered temporarily disabled but I guess for context: I\u2019ve had a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure before. Basically my ptsd got so intense it caused a physical seizure. The Docs are really concerned that without the meds that would normally stabilize me and the hormones I could be prone to more of them and cause damage to myself and my baby.

Don't let people like that bully you. If you don't have it handy, carry the card that comes with the placard so it's easy to grab, but you do NOT owe an entitled AH like that anything. ONLY show it to the cops.", "I'm confused about why you have a disability placard for PTSD, because although your disability is very real, it's not one that impedes your ability to walk to the store from 30 feet further away. And it seems like you generally don't use the placard, recognizing that you're perfectly capable of parking in a regular spot, and don't need to be so close.\n\nSo with that as the framework, using it because you had to pee seems kind of like abusing it, given that they don't hand out \"I need to pee\" placards to every pregnant person.\n\nBut that's all between you and your conscience. Regardless of whether you really need to park in a priority space or not, you've got the placard that entitles you to park there, which as far as anyone else is concerned should be the end of the story.\n\nSo I'm going to score you NTA, because the man in the story is clearly an asshole. Are you an asshole? Well, only you really know whether you're taking advantage here or not.", "[deleted]", "YTA.", "Nope it's not ok for you to have a handicap badge and to use it.

Driving isn\u2019t one for me.it\u2019s not necessarily walking too far\u2026 it\u2019s more so the fear of being surrounded by people who might harm me and not knowing the escape routes, or being able to keep everyone in my line of sight. I have a issue with the anticipation of dealing with my trigger making me just as panicked as the trigger. When it happened it was like i didn\u2019t want to go in there, everything in me tried to run, but I couldn\u2019t stop moving forward. I got tunnel vision and logic didn\u2019t matter anymore. If I went in there I was going to die.
