{"id": 24135, "submission_id": "15l0ydg", "title": "AITA for wanting to move out over lemonade?", "selftext": "I (22F) moved back home to live with my parents two years ago. My family has always been very close, and my parents actually initiated my moving in so I could focus on building my savings. \n\nEverything\u2019s been great: the house is huge, so no one\u2019s living on top of each other, and my mom has been ecstatic over all her kids being home. I take care of my space as well as shared spaces, doing chores, etc. They\u2019ve refused any rent or grocery money I\u2019ve ever offered, insisting I save most of the money I make. My mom grocery shops for the house, and always asks each family member what they need from the store for the week. I always ask for a 12 pack of canned lemonade. They\u2019re my weak spot, I have one or two a day. My mom has never had a problem getting it for me before.\n\nRecently though, she\u2019s been resistant. Thinking it was about the money, I offered to give her the $5, and when that didn\u2019t help I just started getting it myself, but she still glares at me when I drink it. I\u2019ve kept asking what the issue is, but she just walks away and the next time I see her she\u2019s changed the subject entirely. Things came to a head yesterday when I came home from work with some of my personal groceries, including lemonade. My mom lost it, crying and carrying on about how I don\u2019t care about how anyone else feels. I\u2019m at a COMPLETE loss, trying to calm her down, when she tells me if I\u2019m going to continue with these habits I won\u2019t do it under her roof. \n\nHearing that, I admit I did snap a bit. I was hurt that she would threaten to kick me out for any reason, considering how close we\u2019ve always been, but especially since I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything even remotely wrong. We got in a huge back n forth, mainly with me demanding she tell me what\u2019s so wrong with me drinking some damn lemonade and her sneering at me saying \u201cyou know!\u201d. I eventually stormed off to my room, feeling torn. My brother came in shortly after to talk. He says he understands completely where I\u2019m coming from, but is suggesting I do what she\u2019s asking and just stop drinking the lemonade. \n\nI absolutely could, but at this point it\u2019s sort of the principle. I know I\u2019m living with my parents, but I\u2019m an adult and feel I should be allowed to drink my preferred beverage whenever I please, especially if I\u2019m now paying for it and going out to purchase it myself. It is just lemonade, but it goes both ways; my mom shouldn\u2019t care about it either, because it\u2019s JUST LEMONADE. If she\u2019s insisting I stop drinking it or else I\u2019m getting kicked out, I kinda want to take the initiative and just leave. I have plenty saved at this point. I feel bad because she\u2019s my mom, she\u2019s been so good to me and has given me the chance to gather the savings I now want to use to get away from her. I also feel bad for yelling at her; me getting worked up didn\u2019t help the situation. \n\nAITA for how I acted, or WIBTA if I left over this?\n\nHere\u2019s an [update](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway_lemon_ade/comments/15l9ay6/update_aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_over_lemonade/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) for all interested!
