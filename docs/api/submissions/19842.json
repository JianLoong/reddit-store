{"id": 19842, "submission_id": "14b4trk", "title": "AITA for being upset after getting kicked off a vacation?", "selftext": "I (23F) went on vacation with my boyfriend - Logan (24M) - and his dad - Rob (60sM).\n\nRob recently got a payout from legal thing (keeping details vague for privacy), so he asked Logan to road trip with him.\n\nLogan is currently unemployed. He and I were best friends for years before we started dating and I have always been well acquainted with his family. Logan and I have been dating for 4 years, and I've known Rob for 8 years.\n\nI asked Logan if I could fly out to meet them at certain point on their road trip. I had a bunch of PTO I hadn't used, so it seemed perfect. We talked to Rob about it, and Rob was happy. He told me that he would pay for everything on the trip, including my food costs, and I insisted on buying my own flights.\n\nI flew out to meet them, and it was awkward. They'd been traveling together for two weeks already, so I took Rob's annoyance to be because he was sick of traveling. I decided to pay my expenses because Rob seemed annoyed he had to pay for me, but then he got mad at me.\n\nMy third night there, Rob went to bed and Logan and I went out to explore a little bit. I got into an accident and had to go to the hospital. I broke my shoulder and my jaw.\n\nI only had a few more days left on the trip. I talked to the doctors, and they assured me that I would be fine to travel for 3 more days and then fly home.\n\nRob picked Logan and me up from the hospital, and as soon as I got in the car he said I needed to fly home. Logan brought up what the doctors had said, but Rob said it wasn't up for discussion.\n\nLogan asked Rob to drop us off somewhere. I think because Logan wanted his dad to calm down before we spoke more. Rob was outwardly very upset, but he agreed to drop us off. When we met up with Rob again for dinner, he started yelling at me in the restaurant. He said something like, \"this is my trip, and you're an uninvited guest. It's time you go.\" Rob made a jab about my parents, and I replied that my parents would never yell at me, especially in a public place.\n\nI booked a hotel room for myself and told him I was going to stay, with or without him. Logan didn't say anything other than to bring up again what the doctors had said. I talked to Logan about continuing his trip with his dad, but Logan insisted on staying with me. We continued the vacation for two more days and then flew home.\n\nRob cut his trip short and ended up driving back home a couple of days after Logan and I flew out.\n\nRob invited us over for dinner, and I refused to go. Logan is understanding and supports my decision. I told my family about everything that happened, and they are extremely upset by it. They think that Rob kicking me off the trip was horrendous. My parents are upset that Rob would treat me that way.\n\nPersonally, my feelings are hurt and I feel like Rob took away my autonomy. Logan is very supportive of my need for space, but I still feel bad about it.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of comments that I invited myself on a father/son trip, so I'd like to add some context. The road trip they planned was supposed to be 2-3 months long, and I was supposed to join them for six days. I was not the only friend of the family that was to meet them along the course of their trip.\n\nI had previously been invited on a different trip but couldn't go because I didn't have enough PTO, and when this trip came up, I mentioned to Logan how much PTO I had. (I also do not feel entitled to be invited on every trip, I'm just saying why I brought up how much PTO I had in the first place). Logan was excited that I could join them and he asked Rob if I could meet up with them. I was not with Logan when he asked specifically because I wanted Rob to feel comfortable saying no. They were going to a location important to my family's heritage, and Rob told me directly that he was very excited to experience seeing it with me. I had no indication that Rob did not want me on the trip.", "created_utc": 1686941586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b4trk/aita_for_being_upset_after_getting_kicked_off_a/", "score": 1709, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The story jumps straight from Rob being happy and paying for everything, to Rob being annoyed and mad.  Then you\u2019re in a random accident with multiple broken bones and Rob is even more mad.  Either you\u2019re leaving things out, or something happened on the trip before you joined it and Logan isn\u2019t sharing that with you.  Either way, not enough I N F O.  \n  \nEdit: alright, I\u2019ve accidentallied myself into top comment so I owe it a review of the additional information.  While it sounds like you put yourself in a situation that was likely to be volatile, that still doesn\u2019t make you the AH given the available info, so NTA here.", "If all is as you\u2019ve presented in the post and the comments, I\u2019m thinking NTA. \n\nFirst. You\u2019re not supposed to fly for at least 48 hours after a cast is put on. Google, it saves lives, lol. Regardless, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for an adult to get mad at someone for being hit by a car. Even if the person wasn\u2019t a welcome visitor. Compassion should exist for the person that\u2019s been in his sons life all this time. \nOne of my kids friends drives me NUTS and always invites herself along, even when she\u2019s not welcome. But you better believe that as an adult, if I see someone get hurt - even someone I barely know- compassion comes first. \n\nIf you really made sure Rob was asked in such a way that he could have said no, and he agreed to you being on the trip, then you were just taking him at his word. \nAlso, if other people met up with them on different legs of the journey, it isn\u2019t reasonable to be upset with you for also visiting. \nIf Rob suffers chronic pain and mood swings, it could simply be that days and days on the road started to wear on his nerves and he should have handled it better. \nI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve thought \u201chey, let me do this activity with my kid. It sounds so fun.\u201d  Then I get in neck deep and wish I\u2019d done ANYTHING else with my time.", "INFO: Why did you want to stay on this trip after you broke your jaw and shoulder? You likely wouldn't have been able to eat or talk properly or move around comfortably, much less do whatever tourist things they had planned. And I'm sure would you have been in intense pain. Why would you insist on staying?", "NTA - In one of your comments, you kind of state that Rob can change moods quite quickly (not only on this trip). Sounds as if that happened and you dealt with it as best you could. He did seem happy to have you join them for a few days before the trip. Perhaps when things calm down, you can discuss this calmly.  Hope you are healing from your injuries.", "NTA and I\u2019m going to guess that you can chalk most of Rob\u2019s behavior to a mix of traveling fatigue, chronic pain, and just normal grumpiness and irritability that people get when they are out of their normal element for too long. \nI wouldn\u2019t take it personally and I\u2019m betting that now that he\u2019s been home and chilled out, he\u2019s probably wanting to apologize. It could be the reason he invited you for dinner, to try to make amends. \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird for people to blow up on each other while traveling. I\u2019ve had my worst fights with friends after being together too long in unfamiliar places.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like he has a mood disorder and has no desire to do anything about it because terrorizing everyone else is easier than being a decent person.\n\nMy mother is like this. Moans about how nobody loves her, but when anyone comes to visit she bounces between mildly nice and outright hateful monster.\n\nRob really just has no idea how lucky he is that he son even tolerates him.", "NTA. Logan is really quiet for being the one most likely to have all the information to make this make sense.", "NTA - You inquired and communicated well. Rob had many opportunities to say no or reduce your travel time. Does Logan have insight as to why his father's behavior changed?  I am sorry you were injured and endured him yelling at you at a time you were in pain. This is a person to not fully trust what they say or promise. Best to you.", "NTA - I don't know why everyone is expecting you to be a mind reader here or future teller? You asked to join for a duration of the group, everyone said yes and was excited, and then you were treated poorly just for showing up and being there.... It's not like they said no and you forced your presence on everyone. You shouldn't have been treated rudely because the trip wasn't going as expected.", "NTA but I don\u2019t understand how he took your autonomy away?", "NTA - and good for both you and Logan.  do you think Rob made the offer but didn't think you would really do it?  it sounds like something else is going on with Rob to make him act that way.", "How did you know rob was happy about you joining the trip? Was it something Logan just said? \u201cOh rob is happy about you joining\u201d. Or did he say \u201cI\u2019d be happy to have you join us\u201d", "Wait, you broke your jaw, and a little while later you\u2019re going out to dinner?   I thought breaking your jaw was a big deal.", "Info: How did you get hurt?  If you were doing something stupid, I\u2019d be pissed and tell you to go, too.", ">\"this is my trip, and you're an uninvited guest. It's time you go.\"\n\nI feel like this explains pretty succinctly why he was upset. You invited yourself on the trip and basically completely derailed the trip he had planned with his son. I don't want to call you an asshole, but I also don't really understand what you don't understand about the situation. \n\n>I feel like Rob took away my autonomy.\n\nWhat? How? By telling you to leave?", "Personally, I would date Kendall, rather than Logan. That said, the patriarch was awful to you, so NTA.", "Wait, you broke your jaw, and a little while later you\u2019re going out to dinner?   I thought breaking your jaw was a big deal.", "NTA I'm not sure what could have happened in those 2 weeks or if maybe Rob felt obligated to let you come but it's not like you were trying to hijack their whole road trip.", "NTA.", "[deleted]", "Confused on how you broke your jaw and shoulder, got out of hospital, didn\u2019t need to see a surgeon, went to dinner, had enough strength to argue; stayed for 2 more days and then went home and still continued this?\nDid you ever see a surgeon? You should take better care and let the boys handle this. His dad is upset about something and probably his son.", "NTA\n\ndid he really kick you off of the vacation because you got injured? or am i horribly misreading this?", "INFO \n\n>He said something like, \"this is my trip, and you're an uninvited guest. It's time you go.\"\n\nAre you sure you were invited because Rob doesn't think you were?", "NTA based on the edit and other comments you\u2019ve made. You said Rob is prone to flipping a switch and changing his temper suddenly, and it seems that this had happened on the trip well before your arrival. Everyone who has the context and still thinks Y the A H probably hasn\u2019t experienced a parent with that kind of temper.", "NTA- I don't get all the Y T A's, if Rob was not okay with you joining them for a brief period of their trip I doubt a grown-adult would say \"yeah of course!\" And even WILLING to pay for ALL if not MOST expenses during your stay. If anyone reads OP's edits this isnt uncommon for Rob to become irritated or have moodswings and tbh sounds like something my dad would've done who is manic bi-polar and flips like a light switch half the day. I just hope for OP and her BF's sake they either try and have a civil conversation with him about what happened and he can either explain and talk to OP and they can resolve the tension or OP and their BF set some clear boundaries with Rob until then.", "Interesting how the story has changed SO drastically to favor OP and villify Rob.", "It\u2019s sucks you got hurt and rob was like that, but I\u2019d guess he wanted the time just with his son and didn\u2019t feel like he could say no when you asked", "YTA.\n\nYou pushed your way onto a father-son trip and changed the dynamics of the trip. It seems likely that this change made the father a third wheel on the very trip he planned and was paying for.\n\nFinally, you had serious injuries. How would have staying on a trip with a freshly broken shoulder and jaw played out? You wouldn't have enjoyed yourself and everyone would be forced to cater to your serious injuries. \n\nIt was time to go home. Any sensible person would have gone home immediately. \n\nDon't hold a grudge here. Being asked to go home under these circumstances wasn't outrageous. In fact, it was the right thing to do.", "Sounds like a clash of \u201cask\u201d vs \u201cguess\u201d culture to me.\n\nYou asked thinking they would just say no if they/Rob didn\u2019t want you to attend.\n\nMeanwhile you asking meant they felt obligated to say yes. It made them resentful b/c they felt like since you weren\u2019t directly invited it was obvious (to him) what this trip was - a father son trip.\n\nI think ESH is the best option.\n\nYou for inviting yourself along.\n\nLogan for not being a better \u201ctranslator\u201d between parties.\n\nRob for his massive overreaction and apparent inability to just say \u201cno thanks\u201d to your request.", "YTA\n\n***You invited yourself*** to a segment of a family vacation.\n\nRob was resentful about your presence - he had planned this trip with his SON and you decided to jump into it.\n\nYour parents, instead of being upset at Rob, should be embarrassed that they never taught not to invite yourself places.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA you never should have put Rob and Logan in the awkward position of inviting yourself on a father son trip.  Obviously they said ok to not be the bad guy but didn't really want you there.  If you were wanted on the vacation you would have been invited without you needing to ask.  This is why it is rude to invite yourself.", "What? Totally YTA! You inserted yourself into a father son trip and are pissed because dad doesn't want you there, and son would rather go with you\n\nWow.", "Fucking Logan", "YTA. Why in the world did you even think it was okay for you to invite yourself on a father-son trip?", "MAYBE ... Rob hadn't realized how expensive his trip would be and that's why he was upset/grumpy when they picked you up?\nThings cost more these days, especially traveling. As an older person maybe under-estimated how his settlement $$ wouldn't take him as far these days.", "ESH - you shouldn't have asked to go on the trip in the first place, but Rob had every opportunity to say no.  Hell, he could have had Logan tell you that he changed his mind when his chronic pain started flaring and ask you not to come out.  Instead, he said yes, gave you every indication that you were welcome, and then was an ass to you while you were there.  \n\nI'd just distance myself from Rob and try to stay out of the father/son dynamic he has with Logan.", "Leaning towards YTA. We have no details on your injury other than it happened. It kind of sounds like that put Rob over the edge\u2026he went from a trip with his son to having to worry about you guys not entering a hospital when he isn\u2019t around.

So traveling with a family member that you aren't close with while in constant pain is going to quickly make someone tense. Logan's behavior definitely makes it seem like OP was not in the wrong and that this was just a bomb waiting to go off. I agree that Rob just ended up lashing out at OP because she is an easy target.", "Yeah, and the crackdown on painkillers following the opioid epidemic hasn't helped. I have chronic pain, and people in the community have gotten depressed from uncontrolled pain & completed s--cide. The stress from pain can cause inflammation, leading to health problems like heart attacks", "I think that as well.", "They were supposed to be gone for almost 1/4 year, you bet that I would visit my partner if I had the chance (meaning everyone is OK with it). Other friends and family members visited them, too, so why should OP visiting them be an issue?", "You know the trip is a terrible idea before op even enters the picture as two people who don't get along are for some reason choosing to go on a 2-3 month road trip. Road trips can end friendships I can't even imagine if it started with two people who weren't close!", "I have chronic pain and I\u2019m in pain management & on opioids. Overall, they dramatically improve my quality of life, but they can be just as much of a curse as they are a blessing. I\u2019m in therapy and I (like to think) I\u2019m very self-aware, so I can tell when I\u2019m about to snap during a bad pain flare up (or when I have issues getting my meds - there are a lot of med shortages in the US right now) and I can control myself, but it\u2019s really hard and takes a lot of work. It doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior, but Rob might not have the tools to handle that kind of situation.", "If your relative only turned awful after taking opioids for a flare-up, that sounds to me like they weren't the correct meds for them, or perhaps interacting badly with another medication. I've been on opioid painkillers for nearly 15 years, thanks to a rare and extremely painful muscle atrophy disease (opioids are the only thing that keep me from being largely bedridden) and taking a pill during a flare-up made me *nicer*, because the pain minimized. I never heard of anyone becoming the opposite, and I've met a lot of chronic pain patients at this point in the journey.\n\nHonestly it sounds to me like Rob has something else going on, perhaps some kind of mood/personality disorder, with chronic pain alongside.", "Why didn't you just ask how the accident happened?", "She's dating Logan. How is it weird that she's involved?? Tf.", "Logan seems to have spoken for Rob a lot. Maybe that contributed to the problem. OP and Logan going off on their own so much may have just struck a nerve with Rob if he was already in pain. I am a chronic pain sufferer as well and on those days where my pain is at its worst, it is best to just not engage me at all. I can\u2019t do severe pain and a Miss Sunshine personality at the same time. \n\nOne thing I do know is that having a guest on a road trip/vacation that gets seriously injured, even though it\u2019s an accident, is the fastest way to get yourself sent home, and never invited to join in again. (I have been in both positions-host and injured guest-and it just ruins the mood of everybody else for the rest of the time. \n\nI am having trouble just accepting this whole story, as told by OP, because there\u2019s such contrast in Rob before the trip and when OP joined the trip. But OP has had a believable response to all questions.

The jaw doctor said it wasn't \"that broken\", so they put four studs in my mouth (two in the top and two in the bottom) that are held together with rubber bands. I can eat solid foods if I want to, but nothing super chewy. I've opted to eat mostly liquids out of convenience. \n\nMy shoulder was also \"not that broken\" and it was decided I didn't need surgery. I've had several follow-up appointments since then and it was all the same - no surgery and I'll heal back to 100% with just PT. No cast or sling was needed because it could lead to \"frozen shoulder\" (I think that's the term they used). \n\nI wasn't in a lot of pain and am still not.", "Adults can use their words", "\n\nimo, i think this is a \"lost in translation\" type thing.\n\nI think maybe a fracture or a hairline fracture.

She wasn't present when Logan asked his father if she could visit them for 6 days. He is an adult.

That's why people make throw away accounts and it's fine.", "exactly, this isn't talked about enough. there are sites run by doctors tracking the suicides of people cut off medication. I had to leave support groups for my diseases because too many people were dying, both of suicide and their bodies shutting down, or strokes/heart attacks. I met a wonderful elderly man in one group who needed opiates to eat, and watched as he slowly starved to death after being cut off. watched as doctors treating pain refugees had charges levied against them. I have damage to my heart from uncontrolled pain as a teen, too. it's so rough out there for people with chronic pain (and those treating it). I'm guessing this man isn't on pain relief because he was going to be gone for months, and to get meds you need to be seen, pill counted, and drug tested every month now and can't fill anything out of state. prohibition never works, especially when it's livesaving medication. I hope you are coping alright with your pain, thank you for bringing this issue up.", "Multiple people already had. I was putting some of my reasoning in to make OP understand why that particular piece mattered.", "Yeah.. I am not sure I'm buying this narrative. For one, I don't think that two different doctors would both use folksy non-medical terminology like \"not that broken\" to describe an actual break in a bone. They would say something like \"hairline fracture\" if that is what it was. If your jaw was dislocated but the bone was not broken, they would say that. \n\nI have had several oral procedures, and I know that even if you only had local anesthesia you would still be woozy afterward, and your face would be swollen up like a balloon for the rest of the day. If you had studs drilled into your jawbones, you wouldn't be hopping in the car being like \"Cool hey Rob thanks for the ride, can you drop us off at this place we wanna check out?\" Not to mention, if you \"semi-broke\" your jaw as a result of hitting the pavement with your face, you must have had a decent amount of facial bruising and abrasions, no? Most people prefer not to be going out on the town with gnarly looking facial swelling and injuries.\n\nSome of these details are still not adding up for me. Broken bones, even a hairline fracture, hurt like a MF. Doctors don't usually say to patients with broken bones \"well your bone is not THAT broken so continue on with your vacation!\" My suspicion is you may have an issue with exaggerating things to get attention, and perhaps this is why Rob blew up at you and wanted you off his trip.", "Yes, that\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that OP invited herself. They both agreed (BF and father), but they never issued an invitation.\n\nI am an adult and when people ask me if so-and-so can come, I generally (begrudgingly) agree, unless there\u2019s an actual conflict and not just my preference. Because it\u2019s the nice thing to do. Also, sometimes I think it sounds great, then think about it and regret it, but I\u2019ve already agreed. \n\nI avoid such things by rarely hosting family gatherings. If I do host, I address my emails to each person and list ALL the people I have invited. You would think that if I haven\u2019t invited someone, it isn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t think about it. I would really rather someone say, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t attend because my friend will be visiting me from out of town.\u201d That gives me the choice of saying, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Enjoy sightseeing with your friend\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring them along?\u201d. If someone asks if their friend can come and there\u2019s no real reason why they can\u2019t, I can say, \u201cI\u2019m sure your friend would much rather spend time with you doing something fun\u201d, and you may or may not take the hint and stop asking.
