I don't know exactly how to explain it but it's a small building with 4 apartments in it. My landlord lives across the street in another unit he owns. \n\nI got a really good rate. I believe this is due to my landlord having a crush on me and wanting me to live nearby. (I know, stupid. Red flag and I should have said no but I couldn't pass up on the deal) on top of this he has always let me paid less than the agreed upon amount. He always says something like 'don't worry about it' and I'm a model tenant that he enjoys. I have saved all documentation of these exchanges. He always offers. I never ask. \n\nOne day my boyfriend is over and asks me why I have a camera in the bathroom. This is news to me. I ask him to show me and he points out a small camera on the bathroom towel shelf. I'm horrified. It's facing the glass shower. Him and I sweep the house. We find another small camera in my bedroom\n\nI confront my landlord and he first denies the cameras at all. I explain my bf works in cyber security and recognized them. He then claims it's for security. Bullshit, they're in my bathroom and bedroom. Then he says it's to make sure I don't damage the property and he's 'covering his ass'. \n\nI called him a pervert and told him I was moving out ASAP and he was lucky I wasn't calling the police. (I still might get them involved. I've taken pics and saved texts). \n\nBecause of work and family responsibilities I took about ten days to get all of my stuff out (I didn't stay there).  So I was there about two weeks out of the month. My landlord is insisting I pay the full month plus a last minute lease breaking fee and I can \"forget about any discount\" since he was \"was just being nice before finding out what an entitled brat\" I am. I have said I will pay him a percentage of the rent on my lease for the two weeks but that's all and he was lucky to get that. He says I'm an AH and is threatening to sue me for the remainder and some made up 'damages'. I am technically breaking a lease.\n\nAITA\n\nUpdate: i mentioned in the comments I was going to but just so you don't have to look for it: I have contacted the police and a lawyer.

I'm not sure if I can legally notify the neighborhood on the Nextdoor app but I will consult a lawyer. I think I was hesitant to go to the police because:\n1. I was technically paying him less money and was breaking my lease without notice or paying the penalty\n2. I get nervous with police/legal involved\n3. I realized I was blaming myself a bit for accepting a discount for so long when I knew it was because he had a weird thing for me. I know this is silly and I didn't deserve this but my boyfriend suggested that maybe I'm blaming myself a little to cope with the fact I've been violated and something was out of my control. I think this may be the case. \n\nWhile even though, I don't necessarily want to get in a big legal situation, I absolutely don't want him doing this to anyone else. I will definitely file a report.
