It is also understandable that your sister would feel that her acceptance into medical school is a significant achievement, especially given the competitive nature of the admissions process.\n\nIt is not helpful to try to compare different accomplishments and determine which is \"better\" or more deserving of recognition. It is important to recognize and celebrate the achievements of each individual, regardless of what they are.\n\nIt is also not helpful for your sister to try to use her potential future earnings or responsibilities to your parents as justification for why her accomplishment is greater than yours. This is a divisive approach that can cause tension and conflict within a family.\n\nIt is important for you and your sister to try to communicate and understand each other's perspectives, rather than becoming defensive or argumentative. You should also remember that your parents are ultimately responsible for how they choose to celebrate your sister's accomplishment, and it is not helpful for either of you to try to dictate their decisions.

Your sister should be proud of herself, and so should the rest of the family. I'm sure she worked hard, and going into medicine is an admirable goal.\n\nBut it's not objectively or quantifiably a \"superior\" education to all other forms of post-graduate education. It's just one great field of study that leads to a good career.  And the reality is that there are lots of other fields of study that lead to wonderful careers . . . and further, that a good education is arguably almost always a wonderful goal in itself, because it expands one's understanding of the world and ability to think critically about all kinds of things. As my own father (an internationally respected legal scholar in his field) has said to me more than once: \"You learn for the sake of learning, because a smart company wants to hire someone who has a great depth and breadth of knowledge about the world, who isn't just 'trained to do a job' but who KNOWS HOW TO THINK, to approach an unfamiliar problem and see it from a new perspective . . . and those are actually things you learn even from a good classical or liberal arts education!\" \n\nMy own sibling got a graduate degree in a field of literature. Seems useless and self-indulgent, right? But years later they work as a translator for clients ranging from writers of well-known novels to huge pharmaceutical companies and the World Bank. I'd hardly call that \"useless\" or \"less important\". And part of the reason they have such impressive clients? Their clients love that their skill with words means that they aren't just \"able to do the job\" but have the proficiency to understand the nuances of language required for a wide variety of projects and areas of expertise. Literature degree, natch. \n\n**NTA**. There's nothing wrong with medical school, or training in a career that will let her help other people.

The exceptions are only on VERY niche majors that also don't have as much financial upside or specific VERY elite programs in other fields....it is easier to be accepted into Law Schools, or Doctoral Physics programs (I know, I was accepted into a good medical school and didn't go, but got accepted into multiple doctoral Physics programs that were very prestigious)....so unless you're comparing a 'typical' Medical school to Harvard Law, it is almost certainly a more competitive 'win' than getting accepted into a Masters program (OK, maybe not one of the top 10 MBA programs or whatever, like Whorton).\n\nStill, you didn't go for that, and you had a great accomplishment.  A masters in education is awesome, and you should be proud.
