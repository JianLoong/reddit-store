You should probably divorce his dumbass. NTA", ">When I was pregnant, his dad went on a racist rant about me to my husband within my earshot. He called me many names and racial slurs.

Unless he demonstrates understanding that what he felt, said, and did was wrong and that he shows actual remorse.\n\n>My husband never defended me\n\nAlso you don't have a FIL problem.  You have a husband problem.", "NTA\n\nYou do get that you should be more concerned about your husband's behavior than the FIL?\n\n FIL is an AH, but that your husband never showed you any loyalty at a critical time that ANY decent person would have spoken up, and calls you \"petty\" for expecting an apology is beyond understanding.\n\nIf FIL still has strong feelings about race, why would you be willing to expose your son to him?", "NTA. You are allowed to do what you want with your child. If your FIL can\u2019t apologize, that\u2019s on him. Shows how shitty he is.\n\nSide note: shame on your husband for being a coward.", "NTA - It's really not an outrageous request. \n\nI'll  even write a script for your husband to relay to his dad:\n\n\"I'm sorry that I am a racist prick\"\n\nFIL can practice that phrase in the mirror until he feels comfortable saying it to you.", "Divorce your husband for condoning his father's racism against you and your son.", "NTA, OP. Your FIL and DH are, though. FIL for obvious reasons and your hubby for not backing you up with his nasty relatives. Your husband knows that your son, at two years old, will not remember meeting racist grandpa. The proposed meeting is 100% for his dad. Eff that. If FIL is not willing to apologize, then he's as much of a racist ass as he's ever been. Your husband needs to step up or he will be an ex, paying child support and jockeying visitation schedules.", "Sorry to suggest the nuclear option, but I think you need to leave your husband. He a) did not defend you against his racist father and b) wants you to bring your child around his racist father. Your husband is racist for being okay with all of this", "NTA\n\nYour racist bigot FIL has no right to access to your son. You don't need to subject yourself to that either. Even if the bigot apologizes, he's still a bigot. Trash is trash, and keeping your child away from that is a valid decision to make.", "Nta. Your son will not remember him , ever.  So there is zero benefit for your son to meet him.   Your fil can go to his death bed knowing he didn\u2019t get forgiven , and not seeing your son. And you h is a dick.", "Has your husband apologized for being an AH? I think you may need to revisit that if not. \n\nBut if your FIL isn\u2019t willing to apologize it must not be that important for him to meet his grandson. \n\nNTA.", "Why did you continue staying with a racist who won't push back against his racist ass dad when he was apparently saying literal slurs about you? NTA but also figure out an exit strategy and get away from this man.", "Why are you putting up with your spineless husband.  My husband and I are a mixed race couple, although I do pass. If my husband heard his parents calling me slurs, he'd have cut them off entirely.  There are a couple of things about my family culture that my husband has trouble understanding, but he has always been helpful in my trying to pass on my culture.  Love isn't enough there has to be give and take. Nta.", "NTA and even if he apologizes it doesn't change his view on what you are. Protect your son, let this man leave this world living with his hate. Death is no reason to give him what he wants and no guarantee he'll be respectful in any way. And your husband...I can't even.", "Nta but your husband is.  He didn't defend you against his racist father.  He won't defend his son.  WHhy would a father want his son to met a racist who could say something to hurt his son.", "NTA. Your husband didn't learn a damn thing.", "NTA\n\nThere is no \u201cuntil he apologizes\u201d because he shouldn\u2019t be in his grand kids life period, he says racial slurs about the same UNBORN child so why should he be anywhere near him?\n\nAlso please OP take this as the red flag it is to either divorce your invertebrate husband or have a sit down conversation about his clear enabling of his father.", "NTA! Why on earth would you expose your baby to a racist?? He owes you an apology for sure! Then decide from there. You don't owe that man nothing And tell your husband the next time he doesn't stand up for you and your child against racist remarks you'll leave his ass too.", "Tell him you\u2019ll bring the kid to his funeral", "If he is SO RACIST that he can\u2019t even apologize for racist slurs, then does your husband truly believe his dad is going to love his little black grandchild?  I think not.\n\nHe can\u2019t even apologize? Seriously?\n\nNTA", "Does the FIL know about the ultimatum or is this something you've only spoken to your husband about so far?\n\nIt's understandable that you don't want your son exposed to someone who is obviously racist, especially considering that your son obviously has those elements in him as well.  I would think of your son before anything else (which I'm sure you do).  How would he feel if his grandfather died and he never got to meet him?\n\nMy grandmother was abusive towards my mom, but was wonderful with me.  My mother allowed me the opportunity to have my own relationship with her outside of their abuse and IF for some reason my grandmother hadn't been wonderful to us, I'm sure she would have taken us out of the picture.\n\nI would give your son the same opportunity because maybe their relationship can be different.
