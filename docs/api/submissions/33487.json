But if she is playing in the pool with her cousins she doesn't six pack a five year old.", "What in the post made the kids seem arrogant in their wins?", "I mean yea, when you are at work the goal is to get the promotion.  No where in this story were the kids taking advantage of anyone.  They didn't get competitive until money was involved, which is exactly what they said would happen.  There was no trick.  There was no hustle.  They were 100% honest.", "I have more family than the ONE brother who had the issue.", "I'm more interested in the fact that these kids never try that hard in games because they play to have fun, but somehow are absolute experts at the game the second money is involved. You don't typically get good at games if you don't take them seriously. Are the kids playing a lot of money matches, and honing their skills in those?", "How is playing a skilled competition for money remotely related to gambling?", "My children are all familiar with odds and how they work. I helped them with statistics all the time.", "That's life. Sometimes the polite person may kick your ass very hard, if you cross their borders.", "Found the brother", "Yes it is terrible to be in a house full of children that are not crying because they lost. Or having a tantrum because since the rules have always been winner stays they never get more than one turn. I want all the kids in my family to hate playing games with my children.", "Thanks for taking time out of your assuredly busy schedule to comment on my worthless argument. LoL.", "Yes. Sub-Zero.

Comprehension is key.", "Because the world is full of monetary incentives?", "How much pleasure do you get from lapping little children in Mario Kart?", "You know they\u2019re kids right?  The ones goofing off and not taking the game seriously are kids.  If losing is fun for them, let them be.", "Yeah, it's also weird as soon as money is on the line not only are the kids winning, but they're apparently doing so rather easily, it does feel weirdly insulting, like they're too good to even bother.\nAlso, it's Mario Kart, you don't have to lose to take turns, you can just take turns", "My father used the Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura School of gaming. \"Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat\".", "Still cookin\u2026 dont take it out now\u2026\n\nJust need the part where dad says to not destroy the cousins, they are innocent of the father\u2019s sin, etc etc.", "No you didn\u2019t.

That's a physical game, you don't want them to get hurt. That's an unequal comparison. But in ordinary, non physical games, what's the point? In my family, I have always been very good at trivia and things like that. My little sister would cry if she lost to me. My mom pointed out that I was good at some things, my sister at others. For example, my sister was an awesome gymnast. I would probably break my neck if I tried to tumble. Why hide what you are good at to falsely make someone feel secure. It's a game. Everyone plays to their ability. Everyone plays honorably. No bragging.", "Didn't call the kids louses.

My youngest let his uncle pick his own character and let him pick for him as well. He did lose one round to Sub-Zero, a character in Mortal Kombat that my brother has been playing as since 1992. \n\nThis is what you wrote. You only describe Sub-Zero as a character in MK.

It's one thing to admit someone is better. It's an entire other thing to spend an entire game on the backfoot and unable to really pull anything off because someone else is so way ahead of you. \n\nOf course, it depends on the game too, something like Mario Kart lets you still get something out of it since you have the NPCs to compete with. But something like Smash or any 1v1 game you basically get shut down entirely if the other player is way better and you aren't even really playing.", "Ah. So play in such a way that the littles have a chance to win? That seems like a really good idea. I will have to bring up ALLOWING SMALL CHILDREN A CHANCE TO WIN. Oh whoops. My bad.

Then a little voice at the back of my brain shouted \"dick billed platypus\", and now I have a fun new image wandering around up there.", "Then play games where everyone is more or less on equal footing. I suck at a lot of video games, not wired that way. Now my SO loves them and is pretty good at most of them. When we play together, I don't expect him to play to my level. Even if he started a character at my level, he is still better. He knows the mechanics, etc. He can explain it to me till the cows come home. My eyes glaze and I lose consciousness I think. But, I never expect him to tone it down. I learn a few things even in my befuddled state", "Are you being deliberately obtuse. You brought up the volleyball example and the children getting hurt. I said of course in that instance you play for the competition. But if a similarly aged cousin, who knows that their cousin is really good at the sport asked to play, aren't you insulting them by giving them a lesser game? I could either say, hey cuz, take it easy on the amateur or cuz, play your game. This should be a conversation before the game. Don't assume that special treatment is wanted.", "Found the neckbeard", "They do when their parents suck at parenting", "ok, but these are children, who want to play with their older cousins. Older cousins who, from the sounds of it, don't set out to mercilessly beat them at a game. Maybe its even a game that the children just aren't good at, but hey its mario, and the kids love mario, so they want to play mario kart or smash bros because the characters they like are in the game. I have a niece and nephew who are not very good at playing video games yet. They still love playing mario kart with me or my brother despite the fact that we can beat them every time. So since we know we could win if we played seriously, we don't. We do stupid things we wouldn't normally do, like see if we can skip this part of the map by doing X. Most of the time it results in us falling off the map and the niece and nephew catch up to us, we then get ahead and do another stupid experiment because why would we go all out against literal children just trying to have fun with their uncles? Its fine that you, personally, don't expect your SO to tone down their game play for you, but, and to be fair this is just an assumption on my part, you aren't a literal child. The only person bothered by the older kids action in this story is a grown ass adult who seems to be way too interested in being competitive for his own good. Unless the little kids were also upset about it, this is a pointless line of argument", "They were playing video games with their cousins. They were \"playing to their level\" so the cousins had a chance. I have been clear. You seem to lack comprehension skills.", "Not at all. I am saying that absent some legitimate reason why a player should tone down their game, like physical or if an adult is playing Mario with a child who can't play, a person should play honestly. The uncle is a great example. If your kids can beat him, it's a game. Unless he can't take others being better. Then that's a him problem, isn't it?", "My children were playing against their younger and much less skilled cousins. That was their reason for not playing to their full abilities."]}
