{"id": 27761, "submission_id": "16tr241", "title": "AITA for calling my husband disgusting?", "selftext": "My husband and I have two young boys who have some trouble hitting the toilet. So the bathroom that they use the most tends to have an odor. I found a blacklight flashlight that will show you all the little pee spots you may miss when you clean. \n\nWhen I went into that bathroom with the light, I found some spots I didn't expect splatters, but then I also noticed some spots on the wall higher up that couldn't have been from them. That bathroom has a door right next to the toilet that connects to the laundry room.\n\nI followed those spots to see what it was. I almost wish I had never done that. The laundry room walls, the front of the washer and dryer, the laundry baskets were all COVERED in what was obviously semen. My children are too young for this to be anything to do with them. \n\nMy husband and I work opposite shifts so I texted telling him that we don't have to discuss it ever, but he needs to clean ALL OF IT and told him where the blacklight was. I got a text back later that night while I was at work that simply said \"Done.\" \n\nThen, last week, I had two of the laundry baskets in the living room where I could see them in broad daylight. They were not clean. I got some disinfectant spray and tried to clean them and was gagging the whole time. I spent maybe 10 minutes on it before I gave up and put them out with the trash and bought new laundry baskets. I told him he owed me money for new laundry baskets because they were disgusting. \n\nWhen he came home, he gave me the money and didn't say a word. Then I had to leave town for the weekend.\n\nThe first night I was back, he got mad at me for \"calling him disgusting last week.\"\n\nI lost it a little bit there. Told him first, I didn't call **him** disgusting, but said the laundry baskets were disgusting and asked how he could possibly have behaved that way with absolutely zero consideration for anyone else in the house who had to use that room. I asked him how many times he thought the kids touched the walls while trying to reach the light switch, or how many times they or I touched the front of the washer or dryer and then didn't wash our hands after it. I said a lot more because I was really frustrated. Not once has he attempted to apologize or say \"my bad\"  \"I shouldn't have done that\" or anything like that at all.\n\nNow he's telling me that I just held it in my back pocket until I was mad at him to throw in his face. That's not something I do. I was trying to let the whole thing go because I'm sure he's ashamed and embarrassed and didn't want to talk about it. I was trying to just forget about it. \n\nBut in my opinion, when he told me that I called him disgusting last week, that was **him** bringing it up and if he didn't want to talk about it, he shouldn't have brought it up at all. I told him he's feeling bad right now because he's ashamed and  he just wants me to feel bad with him so he's not alone. I'm not playing this game. \n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1695836510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tr241/aita_for_calling_my_husband_disgusting/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So the bathroom that they use the most tends to have an odor.

I got a text back later that night while I was at work that simply said \"Done.\" \n\nThen, last week, I had two of the laundry baskets in the living room where I could see them in broad daylight. They were not clean. I got some disinfectant spray and tried to clean them and was gagging the whole time. I spent maybe 10 minutes on it before I gave up and put them out with the trash and bought new laundry baskets.

Told him first, I didn't call **him** disgusting, but said the laundry baskets were disgusting and asked how he could possibly have behaved that way with absolutely zero consideration for anyone else in the house who had to use that room. I asked him how many times he thought the kids touched the walls while trying to reach the light switch, or how many times they or I touched the front of the washer or dryer and then didn't wash our hands after it. I said a lot more because I was really frustrated. Not once has he attempted to apologize or say \"my bad\"  \"I shouldn't have done that\" or anything like that at all.\n\nNow he's telling me that I just held it in my back pocket until I was mad at him to throw in his face. That's not something I do. I was trying to let the whole thing go because I'm sure he's ashamed and embarrassed and didn't want to talk about it.

It has to mean something that he would do that but I can't figure out what.\n\n Might need to do some research since it's not likely he will be able to explain it due to shame and embarrassment.. or he may not even know what made him do it. How long has he been doing it for and you werent able to notice cuz of no light? Omg.. so many questions. \n\nI would not sit anywhere in my home without checking with the light first \ud83d\ude2c", "\u2026 what the fuck? Why? Why in the laundry room and children\u2019s bathroom? Why not just nut into the toilet like a normal person? Why is he jerking it anywhere but your bedroom anyway?\n\nCheck out the rest of the house under blacklight. This is just, entirely puzzling.", "W t f. Ma\u2019am you married an animal, not a man.", "Doesn't matter; clean up after yourself then.", "I mean sure, maybe, but taking the situation for face value I just really don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible for that to be the answer to whatever was in their laundry room. Op seems a bit\u2026. Overbearing. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to argue with her about it.", "It is distressing. I now have to have an awkward conversation I really don't wanna have. And I have you constantly worry about checking all over the house, regardless of whether he says he will stop doing it or not. And he actually tried to have sex with me the night I tried to clean the laundry baskets. There was no way that was happening. And I don't think he understands why. It's definitely changed the way I see him.", "It wasn't just the walls, which are not anywhere near where detergent would be. It was the baskets and the appliances as well. I assure you, it was not detergent.", "He has a thing for using my used underwear to masturbate with. I don't like that and I've asked him repeatedly not to. But that's obviously in the laundry room. And he locks himself in the bathroom for long periods of time and comes out without ever flushing the toilet. The bathroom leads directly to the laundry room. I know what he's doing in there. He has sat on the sofa with earbuds in watching porn thinking I can't hear it for 15-20 minutes before going into the bathroom/laundry room. I knew he was jacking off multiple times a day. I don't care if he does that. What I didn't know was where it was all going. The look on his face when he's been face to face with me tells me all I need to know. He knows exactly what it is. And so do I.", "Really?  This makes no sense to me!  WHY???", "In her comments.", "No, the splatter in the laundry room is from laundry detergent. It's hard to clean in well enough to get it to stop showing under a black light. The reason you will sometimes see what looks like a trail on someone's clothes is bc the poured the detergent directly on clothes instead letting the water fill before you add clothes.", "100%. That's just disrespectful. And it *is* disgusting.", "He didn\u2019t deny it\u2026", "He's arguing sbout it now,there's no way an innocent person wouldn't ague that \naccusation", "Quite possibly. Either way, laundry or him, Zoolander at the gas pumps comes into mind lol", "If you are going to have a conversation, I expect it will take a lot of patience on your part to weed through him being defensive, embarrassed, and less open about things - before you get to the root of things - beyond the not doing this any more. It may be difficult to suppress the emotion, anger, upset, and any other feelings you will have about this also. I will wish you good luck.", "I really recommend considerations for couples counseling and maybe individual therapy for him also to help him understand this issue.", "I know how awkward it is to have to tell an employee they smell like shit, everyone's noticed, no it isn't the machines. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving to talk to your spouse about not jizzing all over the laundry room seems way worse.", "Check the cars, too.", "Omg\u2026I honestly don\u2019t think I could ever even *look* at my husband again, let alone have sex with him. Ever. This is seriously one of the most fucked up things I\u2019ve read on Reddit.", "Strange question. But did you smell it? You will tell really quick if it's laundry detergent.", "Did you specifically say to him, \u201cyou have been ejaculating all over the place?\u201d \n\nOr did you just say, \u201cyou know what you did. Clean it up.\u201d\n\nLike, I\u2019m trying to understand if the two of you were having the same conversation.", "He doesn't care if his kids touch and see his semen, you should take that blacklight through other rooms in the house just in case. It's at best pathetic and disgusting, at worst extremely creepy and distressing if he's getting off leaving it for his family to interact with.", "Porn addict husband, ew", "Thank you! That makes way more sense.", "He\u2019s filming it in the only room where\u2019s there\u2019s privacy to send to someone and not caring about cleaning it up. He probably wipes it so it\u2019s not noticeable, but doesn\u2019t clean it. It\u2019s either a fetish video or he\u2019s sending it to some poor unsuspecting women. I\u2019ve gotten a a couple anonymous dick pics just like this, it\u2019s disturbing as well as absolutely grotesque", "Seems pretty pertinent to the story dontcha think?", "...you don't think the husband would've asked any follow-up questions to her text telling him they didn't need to talk about it, but he needed to clean it? \n\nReally?", "Then why did the husband clean it up, no questions asked?", "I can assure you, it wasn't from laundry detergent", "To end up with what OP described, there must have been a whirling dervish with an open jug of detergent in each hand.", "Thats what I was thinking and hoping she was going to say she found out it was. Laundry soap.. liquid soap kinda looks like it could be.. not soap lol.. I've found spots on the floor around the washer. I've also felt spots on fuzzy blankets that I dumped soap directly on, once the blanket comes out of the dryer there are spots that feel stiff and waxy. It's me and my young daughter that live here so none of that could be in my house lol.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nSure, Jan", "THIS", "I didn\u2019t read where OP actually told him what IT was. \n\nShe seemed to say, \u201cno questions asked, this is disgusting, you need to clean it. You know what you did.\u201c\n\nCould OP\u2019s husband think he was cleaning laundry detergent off the walls?", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "counselling?? he's wanking over his kids dirty washing he needs locking up?", "You don\u2019t want your kids teachers mentioning that they smell of jizz."]}
