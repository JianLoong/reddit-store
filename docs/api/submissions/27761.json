{"id": 27761, "submission_id": "16tr241", "title": "AITA for calling my husband disgusting?", "selftext": "My husband and I have two young boys who have some trouble hitting the toilet. So the bathroom that they use the most tends to have an odor. I found a blacklight flashlight that will show you all the little pee spots you may miss when you clean. \n\nWhen I went into that bathroom with the light, I found some spots I didn't expect splatters, but then I also noticed some spots on the wall higher up that couldn't have been from them. That bathroom has a door right next to the toilet that connects to the laundry room.\n\nI followed those spots to see what it was. I almost wish I had never done that. The laundry room walls, the front of the washer and dryer, the laundry baskets were all COVERED in what was obviously semen. My children are too young for this to be anything to do with them. \n\nMy husband and I work opposite shifts so I texted telling him that we don't have to discuss it ever, but he needs to clean ALL OF IT and told him where the blacklight was. I got a text back later that night while I was at work that simply said \"Done.\" \n\nThen, last week, I had two of the laundry baskets in the living room where I could see them in broad daylight. They were not clean. I got some disinfectant spray and tried to clean them and was gagging the whole time. I spent maybe 10 minutes on it before I gave up and put them out with the trash and bought new laundry baskets. I told him he owed me money for new laundry baskets because they were disgusting. \n\nWhen he came home, he gave me the money and didn't say a word. Then I had to leave town for the weekend.\n\nThe first night I was back, he got mad at me for \"calling him disgusting last week.\"\n\nI lost it a little bit there. Told him first, I didn't call **him** disgusting, but said the laundry baskets were disgusting and asked how he could possibly have behaved that way with absolutely zero consideration for anyone else in the house who had to use that room. I asked him how many times he thought the kids touched the walls while trying to reach the light switch, or how many times they or I touched the front of the washer or dryer and then didn't wash our hands after it. I said a lot more because I was really frustrated. Not once has he attempted to apologize or say \"my bad\"  \"I shouldn't have done that\" or anything like that at all.\n\nNow he's telling me that I just held it in my back pocket until I was mad at him to throw in his face. That's not something I do. I was trying to let the whole thing go because I'm sure he's ashamed and embarrassed and didn't want to talk about it. I was trying to just forget about it. \n\nBut in my opinion, when he told me that I called him disgusting last week, that was **him** bringing it up and if he didn't want to talk about it, he shouldn't have brought it up at all. I told him he's feeling bad right now because he's ashamed and  he just wants me to feel bad with him so he's not alone. I'm not playing this game. \n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1695836510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tr241/aita_for_calling_my_husband_disgusting/", "score": 1349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were not clean. I got some disinfectant spray and tried to clean them and was gagging the whole time.

I highly suggest doing some research on these types of sexual compulsions and addictions, take into consideration what you learn, and THEN have a sit down talk with him where you aren't there to judge, just wanting to help both of you find a way to help him stop the behavior.

I'd say to save the detailed explanations for a professional, don't put too much pressure on him saying why he does it or what he gets out of it-- these sort of super personal details aren't beneficial for either of you, because it will PERMANENTLY change how you view him....forever you'll replay those thoughts in your head; you don't need that, and he doesn't need the embarrassment. You are his wife, not a licensed mental health professional, so all you can do is love him and encourage him to get help, and as a husband all he must do is prove to you that he will learn to better respect you, your home, your children, and take steps to stop this strange and disturbing behavior NOW.

For one, I think if you've had enough sexual encounters in your life, you can learn how to tell the difference between a chemical substance and a bodily fluid. Even if it's dry. TV and movies like to joke, but bodily fluids have specific characteristics that don't deviate much compared to all the other things people have jokingly claimed look like semen.

The guy just blows his shot in whatever direction he wants, tucks himself away, and leaves. *That* is the absolutely disgusting part. Bodily fluids that are known for spreading disease are just left for anyone to come across. The fact he openly watches porn and ignores your boundaries and uses your undergarments ***is*** concerning and it's something that should be addressed, but even if he isn't using the underwear, he's still deciding to spray his yuck generally across a room and then just walk away.\n\nDoes he leave messes anywhere else in life? Does he eat dinner and leave his plate at the table? If he doesn't make it to the bathroom when he has a stomach flu, does he just leave his barf on the floor? If he spills something in the house, like a soda or whatever, does he just leave it to dry and get sticky? If not, then why does he avoid cleaning up the semen?\n\nIs it a kink? Is it a punishment because you told him not to use your underwear?

The only evidence OP has comes from the university of Trust Me Bro with corroboration by the university of I Can Tell By Looking. Let\u2019s do a little math. Google says that a man produces between 1.5 and 5 milliliters of semen per ejaculation. 1 milliliter is equal to 1 cubic centimeter. If we have a surface like the front of the washing machine that is say, 2 ft. by 2 ft. It would take 3,716 cubic centimeters to cover that surface to a thickness of 1 centimeter. But really, 1 centimeter is still pretty thick, so let\u2019s say that we only want to cover it to a thickness of 1 millimeter. That would still mean we need 371 cubic centimeters/milliliters. Now, if we assume that OP\u2019s husband always ejaculates the 5 mL at the high end of the range, he still would have to jerk off 75 times to make enough semen to cover a 2 ft by 2 ft surface. OP says that the walls, front of washer, front of dryer, and laundry baskets were all covered. So let\u2019s call it 3 or 4 areas of 2 ft by 2 ft. Which do you think is more likely: OP is seeing laundry detergent that has been spilled, or OP\u2019s husband has jerked off a couple hundred times without ever cleaning up after himself once? Keep in mind that to get that kind of coverage 5 mL at a time you would almost have to be keeping track of what you have already covered and aim for a new space or else you would be double coating some areas which would mean the 371 mL would need to be increased.", "I just choked on my drink \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "He should be", "I can assure you, it was NOT detergent.
