Grief is a thing. The last thing you need is some heartless AH saying \u2018I told you so\u2019. \n\n4 - her mom should have known better\n\n5 - your cat wouldn\u2019t have lived longer\n\n\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m glad you broke up with her. Both mom and daughter are lacking common sense. Lol. Very controlling and bad mentality. It\u2019s sad enough that you lost your family member, she didn\u2019t have to run her mouth like that. And her mom defending her is obvious thing to happen. Your mom is just feeling weird because it\u2019s her friend. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t like what they said as well. You go patch up with your mom and keep those women away. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour ex girlfriend seems to take after her mother perfectly\u2014self absorbed and controlling. You just lost your cat, an important part of your life, and your ex has the audacity to give an \u2018I-told-you-so\u2019 and she\u2019s completely wrong on top of everything. Her mom quickly jumps on you, not caring the you are grieving. I think you did the right thing. Cutting your ex out will decrease a lot of toxicity in your life. And if her mom is unhappy about that, then she is an enabler and deserves that rebuke.", "Fuck everybody. OP you are the only respectable person in this scenario. Good for you \ud83d\udc4d", "First things first - I am so sorry for your loss.  I had my dog for 18 years and she died about a year go, so I know what kind of hole that's left in your heart.  I'm so sorry.\n\nAnd NTA.  Cats need meat.  And what she said is unforgiveable.  Like if you two bumped into each other in 20 years, I'd still remember this comment and just feel hatred.", "Did you hear about that archaeological discovery of that Neanderthal that almost domesticated a saber-tooth by trying to feed it grass? Yeah, me neither...", "NTAH\n\nThose people are not only ignorant, but willfully and harmfully so. They are also extremely insensitive. You are better off without either of them.", "NTA it was perfectly appropriate. \n\nSorry about your cat.", "Your ex sounds pretty out of touch with reality. Even if a vegan diet was better for cats (it's not), how much longer was the cat meant to live? 80 years? This is a cat, not a tortoise. \n\nAlthough it always feels too soon, 18 is old for a cat. Your beloved family member led a long life - helped I am sure by respecting his nutritional needs. \n\nNTA. You were right to be upset, and don't deserve to have someone else heaping even more insensitive criticism.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, wanting to feed a cat a vegan diet is nonsense, and ultimatums are a big no no, \n\nSecondly, you were grieving , (so sorry for your loss), and both your mom's friend daughter and your mom's friend were really insensitive", "NTA\n\nThat family can go f themselves.", "NTA. Your ex is an idiot. Vegan, for a cat? Please. These are animals that get most of their liquid intake from blood for the love of God. (That's why they kinda suck at drinking water). You were grieving. You are entitled to being harsh to cold-hearted idiots. I see nothing wrong with your actions.", "Nta what she said was insensitive. SHE didn\u2019t have to be so harsh", "NTA - some different points. The most recent studies are showing vegan cat food is indeed healthier than the processed stuff and cat owners report less health issues (tho many methodological issues as it\u2019s early in the research). The vegan cat food is supplemented with taurine so it does indeed cover all nutrients. What most commenters don\u2019t understand here is commercial cat food already is mostly plant based. It\u2019s largely soy. With other bits thrown in to supplement. A better version of that will generally be healthier. So take that as a premise for this comment. Even so, cue the downvotes and the meat eater bingo anyway\u2026 \n\nCos all that said, even if your friend was right, what your friend said and how she said it was so dickish. To say to someone who just lost a pet that they could have lived longer if they\u2019d listened is horrible, inappropriate, and so on. So yes, they were the asshole to begin with. \n\nNew vegans tend to be \u2018overly evangelical\u2019 rather than more mature and experienced in *how* they approach others. Leading to ultimatums without proper understanding or communication. \n\nBalking at that is understandable. Criticizing the mother tho for what she did as an adult seems over the top. All you had to do was say \u2018she insulted me and my pet right when she died\u2019. Or something similar. So yes, harsh. Assholey? Maybe a little, to the mother. \n\nYou lashed out, and yeah you were harsh. You were understandably emotional. I\u2019d still suggest apologizing to the mother for being harsh, explaining you felt awful at the time given your cat\u2019s death, and her daughter essentially rubber your nose in her death\u2026 one bad moment of an adult woman doesn\u2019t make her mother a terrible mother\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
