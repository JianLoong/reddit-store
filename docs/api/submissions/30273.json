Your ex is an idiot. Vegan, for a cat? Please. These are animals that get most of their liquid intake from blood for the love of God. (That's why they kinda suck at drinking water).

SHE didn\u2019t have to be so harsh", "NTA - some different points. The most recent studies are showing vegan cat food is indeed healthier than the processed stuff and cat owners report less health issues (tho many methodological issues as it\u2019s early in the research). The vegan cat food is supplemented with taurine so it does indeed cover all nutrients. What most commenters don\u2019t understand here is commercial cat food already is mostly plant based. It\u2019s largely soy. With other bits thrown in to supplement. A better version of that will generally be healthier. So take that as a premise for this comment. Even so, cue the downvotes and the meat eater bingo anyway\u2026 \n\nCos all that said, even if your friend was right, what your friend said and how she said it was so dickish. To say to someone who just lost a pet that they could have lived longer if they\u2019d listened is horrible, inappropriate, and so on. So yes, they were the asshole to begin with. \n\nNew vegans tend to be \u2018overly evangelical\u2019 rather than more mature and experienced in *how* they approach others. Leading to ultimatums without proper understanding or communication. \n\nBalking at that is understandable. Criticizing the mother tho for what she did as an adult seems over the top. All you had to do was say \u2018she insulted me and my pet right when she died\u2019. Or something similar. So yes, harsh. Assholey? Maybe a little, to the mother. \n\nYou lashed out, and yeah you were harsh. You were understandably emotional. I\u2019d still suggest apologizing to the mother for being harsh, explaining you felt awful at the time given your cat\u2019s death, and her daughter essentially rubber your nose in her death\u2026 one bad moment of an adult woman doesn\u2019t make her mother a terrible mother\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
