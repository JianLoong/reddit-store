{"id": 20164, "submission_id": "14ef00g", "title": "AITA For Telling My Coworker She Needs To Grow Up", "selftext": "My (F37) coworker \"Marie\"  (38F) asked me for advice after she got written up for always being late to meetings. She was upset and said she \"really wanted my perspective\". I said it professionally, but my advice was that she needed to grow up and start setting alarms and getting up on time. I told her her work quality is great...when she shows up. Marie is a sweet person but she's also the definition of weaponized incompetence. We're 100% remote, I have no idea how you can be late to a meeting in your own house. I only started with the company six months ago, she's been here three years. I've already gotten promoted and been given more duties. Marie is very immature and needs to be constantly reminded to meet deadlines, but when she actually produces work, it's high quality. You can't tell her anything at all like \"I'm off on Thursday\" becomes twisted into \"I'm quitting\" and then she spreads rumors. She has terrible boundaries and outed one of our coworkers by reverse googling their company headshot. It's a progressive company but that was their information to share or not.\n\nWe work in the marketing and content writing department and management is making a lot of noise about moving to AI for a large volume of what we do. Marie is partly the reason. She and I are the only two writers on staff and I'm usually behind because she wasn't honest about missing deadlines so I pick up her slack.\n\nOur morning meeting times never change and the entire team is all in the same time zone. Our morning meeting starts at 9:45 am. She frequently sleeps through it, and then sends a chat \"sorry all! I slept through my alarm again! lol!\" She approaches it with an innocence like she doesn't realize it's not okay. She has a toddler, but has told us all that her husband handles her son in the morning and that he's in daycare by 8:30am. She's always sending us pictures in the work chat about being up late binge-watching entire 5 season shows, or that she fell down a reddit rabbit hole. I condensed some of this into \"we all really enjoy working with you, but there are things you do like being late when we're remote, not communicating that you're behind and need help, and overstepping boundaries that people find frustrating.\"\n\nShe got very offended and said I was being \"shitty\" and siding with our bosses and took the rest of the day off. The next day she reported our managers to HR for favoritism. They don't favor me, they just don't give me shit because I show up on time. My bosses aren't mad but they did warn me that she's on her last strike.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have given her an answer at all and just stayed out of it.", "created_utc": 1687276874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ef00g/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_she_needs_to_grow_up/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't want to hear the truth? Then don't ask for it...", "NTA, it sounds like you gave her balanced feedback, but do stay out of it now and leave it to your managers and HR to manage her out for her performance. \n\nIt might serve you well to also objectively and neutrally document everything you\u2019ve written about here, including the instances of when you covered for her, just to have in your back pocket.", " \"we all really enjoy working with you, but there are things you do like being late when we're remote, not communicating that you're behind and need help, and overstepping boundaries that people find frustrating.\"\n\nThis statement here is imo very good. I wish you had just said this and left it at that. Telling Marie to grow up doesn\u2019t seem like a kind or helpful response. She did ask for your perspective, though. To me it sounds like she has ADHD and needs to be on medicine to help her focus. Being an adult with a child and staying up so late you consistently sleep through alarms isn\u2019t okay. Her screen time while she\u2019s in bed is why she can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s not healthy. Fortunately, that\u2019s not for you to deal with. I guess if I have to give a judgment it\u2019s ESH.", "NTA.  She asked, you answered.", "NTA.\n\nThough her response is predictable, as she clearly just wanted you to join in with her and say the 'bosses suck! You're amazing!' rather than like an actual review.\n\nShe'll get fired sooner or later, it's not your problem. Also, stop picking up her slack. Do your own work, send her reminders at most, but do not agree to just do her work for her when she fails, that is enabling her to keep failing because she knows you'll do it in the end.", "NTA. I'm curious why the company has put up with her unprofessionalism for 3 years. Are they lax with the whole staff, or is it only she who gets a pass for shitty behaviour that negatively impacts you personally and the whole team by extension? Is she related to the business owners, or a family friend?\n\nBeing late to WFH meetings *in your own home* is next level incompetence, and expresses contempt for everyone else's time. No excuse for that.", "NTA the truth hurts sometimes. Being on time for work and meeting key deadlines for projects is a basic workforce expectation. Why people feel entitled to consistently show up late, make excuses, overapologize, but not do any of the footwork to change their behavior is beyond me.", "NTA but she definitely is. \n\nAlso you\u2019re not her boss but also remember you may be causing her to put a target on her back", "Nta - she asked your opinion and she gave it. Nothing wrong here and you weren\u2019t brutally mean. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this.", "NTA because she asked for the answer but\u2026I do the same work and what you have to realize is that everyone is different but more so when they are considered a \u201ccreative\u201d and it 100% drives organized marketing/content folks nuts. The work they do when they have it is brilliant but they need a different system of management than traditional workers. Having also managed these workers but worked with them, they need systems that work for them such as multiple reminders and reality checks. They can be real assets to the organization but require a different approach. I\u2019m not giving her an excuse but you a perspective as you\u2019re going to find these folks throughout your roles at various companies (I admittedly thought it was an excuse as well but have learned it\u2019s not, just almost an alternative reality). \n\nRemember that you can\u2019t control others or what your company decides to do but you\u2019re also not her mother or friend. You\u2019re a colleague and based on your tone in this post, I would suggest a better tact in how you address that because it will cause issues for you because it can get taken out of context and skewed as \u201clack of team spirit/culture\u201d but I hope it doesn\u2019t in this case.", "NTA, but I think you've learned the best thing moving forward is to stay totally out of it.", "NTA. From the sound of it, you gave her very professional, honest feedback that was not meant as an attack. Perhaps she took it that way, but that's her prerogative. Having a coworker like Marie is endlessly frustrating, so I'm sorry you've been having to deal with this. The best thing you can do for yourself now is to not stir the pot. You've said your peace, now let the situation play out.", "NTA - One thing I learned is Don't ask Questions you don't really want the answer to. She asked - you answered- she predictable got mad.  Sounds like she is on her way out the door. Document everything and move on about your day.", "NTA. She asked for your input and you aren't wrong. Also, I know you mentioned that she was a sweet person, but everything you wrote after that seems to be the exact opposite of sweet. She seems incredibly toxic and manipulative with a pleasant veneer over top of it all. If I was in your place, I'd keep as far from her as possible.", ">my advice was that *she needed to grow up*\n\nYou crossed a line with that.\n\nYou could have just told her to be more professional about her appointments.", "NTA. She asked and you answered. You are meaningfully impacted by her behavior, and may have your livelihood impacted severely. Obviously her track record showed her likelihood of twisting peoples' words; you probably could have predicted this would not be taken well and that she'd turn on you, clearly you cannot trust her. But it seems like mgmt and everyone else is aware of the issue and her complaints aren't likely to go anywhere. Her complaint seems retaliatory and I'd guess the write-up she received was supported with documented instances of her failing to meet commitments or show up to meetings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
