She was upset and said she \"really wanted my perspective\". I said it professionally, but my advice was that she needed to grow up and start setting alarms and getting up on time. I told her her work quality is great...when she shows up. Marie is a sweet person but she's also the definition of weaponized incompetence. We're 100% remote, I have no idea how you can be late to a meeting in your own house. I only started with the company six months ago, she's been here three years. I've already gotten promoted and been given more duties. Marie is very immature and needs to be constantly reminded to meet deadlines, but when she actually produces work, it's high quality. You can't tell her anything at all like \"I'm off on Thursday\" becomes twisted into \"I'm quitting\" and then she spreads rumors. She has terrible boundaries and outed one of our coworkers by reverse googling their company headshot. It's a progressive company but that was their information to share or not.\n\nWe work in the marketing and content writing department and management is making a lot of noise about moving to AI for a large volume of what we do. Marie is partly the reason. She and I are the only two writers on staff and I'm usually behind because she wasn't honest about missing deadlines so I pick up her slack.\n\nOur morning meeting times never change and the entire team is all in the same time zone. Our morning meeting starts at 9:45 am. She frequently sleeps through it, and then sends a chat \"sorry all! I slept through my alarm again! lol!\" She approaches it with an innocence like she doesn't realize it's not okay. She has a toddler, but has told us all that her husband handles her son in the morning and that he's in daycare by 8:30am. She's always sending us pictures in the work chat about being up late binge-watching entire 5 season shows, or that she fell down a reddit rabbit hole. I condensed some of this into \"we all really enjoy working with you, but there are things you do like being late when we're remote, not communicating that you're behind and need help, and overstepping boundaries that people find frustrating.\"\n\nShe got very offended and said I was being \"shitty\" and siding with our bosses and took the rest of the day off. The next day she reported our managers to HR for favoritism. They don't favor me, they just don't give me shit because I show up on time. My bosses aren't mad but they did warn me that she's on her last strike.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have given her an answer at all and just stayed out of it.", "created_utc": 1687276874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ef00g/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_she_needs_to_grow_up/", "score": 525, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wish you had just said this and left it at that. Telling Marie to grow up doesn\u2019t seem like a kind or helpful response. She did ask for your perspective, though. To me it sounds like she has ADHD and needs to be on medicine to help her focus. Being an adult with a child and staying up so late you consistently sleep through alarms isn\u2019t okay. Her screen time while she\u2019s in bed is why she can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s not healthy. Fortunately, that\u2019s not for you to deal with. I guess if I have to give a judgment it\u2019s ESH.", "NTA.  She asked, you answered.", "NTA.\n\nThough her response is predictable, as she clearly just wanted you to join in with her and say the 'bosses suck! You're amazing!' rather than like an actual review.\n\nShe'll get fired sooner or later, it's not your problem. Also, stop picking up her slack. Do your own work, send her reminders at most, but do not agree to just do her work for her when she fails, that is enabling her to keep failing because she knows you'll do it in the end.", "NTA. I'm curious why the company has put up with her unprofessionalism for 3 years. Are they lax with the whole staff, or is it only she who gets a pass for shitty behaviour that negatively impacts you personally and the whole team by extension? Is she related to the business owners, or a family friend?\n\nBeing late to WFH meetings *in your own home* is next level incompetence, and expresses contempt for everyone else's time. No excuse for that.", "NTA the truth hurts sometimes. Being on time for work and meeting key deadlines for projects is a basic workforce expectation. Why people feel entitled to consistently show up late, make excuses, overapologize, but not do any of the footwork to change their behavior is beyond me.", "NTA but she definitely is. \n\nAlso you\u2019re not her boss but also remember you may be causing her to put a target on her back", "Nta - she asked your opinion and she gave it. Nothing wrong here and you weren\u2019t brutally mean. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this.", "NTA because she asked for the answer but\u2026I do the same work and what you have to realize is that everyone is different but more so when they are considered a \u201ccreative\u201d and it 100% drives organized marketing/content folks nuts. The work they do when they have it is brilliant but they need a different system of management than traditional workers. Having also managed these workers but worked with them, they need systems that work for them such as multiple reminders and reality checks. They can be real assets to the organization but require a different approach. I\u2019m not giving her an excuse but you a perspective as you\u2019re going to find these folks throughout your roles at various companies (I admittedly thought it was an excuse as well but have learned it\u2019s not, just almost an alternative reality). \n\nRemember that you can\u2019t control others or what your company decides to do but you\u2019re also not her mother or friend. You\u2019re a colleague and based on your tone in this post, I would suggest a better tact in how you address that because it will cause issues for you because it can get taken out of context and skewed as \u201clack of team spirit/culture\u201d but I hope it doesn\u2019t in this case.", "NTA, but I think you've learned the best thing moving forward is to stay totally out of it.", "NTA. From the sound of it, you gave her very professional, honest feedback that was not meant as an attack. Perhaps she took it that way, but that's her prerogative. Having a coworker like Marie is endlessly frustrating, so I'm sorry you've been having to deal with this. The best thing you can do for yourself now is to not stir the pot. You've said your peace, now let the situation play out.", "NTA - One thing I learned is don't ask questions you don't really want the answer to. She asked - you answered- she predictably got mad.  Sounds like she is on her way out the door. Document everything and move on about your day.", "NTA. She asked for your input and you aren't wrong. Also, I know you mentioned that she was a sweet person, but everything you wrote after that seems to be the exact opposite of sweet. She seems incredibly toxic and manipulative with a pleasant veneer over top of it all. If I was in your place, I'd keep as far from her as possible.", ">my advice was that *she needed to grow up*\n\nYou crossed a line with that.\n\nYou could have just told her to be more professional about her appointments.", "NTA. She asked and you answered. You are meaningfully impacted by her behavior, and may have your livelihood impacted severely. Obviously her track record showed her likelihood of twisting peoples' words; you probably could have predicted this would not be taken well and that she'd turn on you, clearly you cannot trust her. But it seems like mgmt and everyone else is aware of the issue and her complaints aren't likely to go anywhere. Her complaint seems retaliatory and I'd guess the write-up she received was supported with documented instances of her failing to meet commitments or show up to meetings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She asked for advice, and you gave her some. She is being very unprofessional and once you've gotten written up for a repeated behavior, you're not on a good path. I wonder what she was expecting you to tell her? That everyone thinks it's just dandy the she's always late?", "NTA. You gave her solid professional advice, it\u2019s up to her what she wants to do with that information.

But for your own sake, I definitely would just not answer her questions in the future that are like this. Keep things work related with her since she twists words.", "NTA. Even if this might be due to an undiagnosed condition, e.g. ADHD - she's a grownup. It's her responsibility to get treatment/support if her dysfunction at work has a medical origin. Sounds like if they fire her, it's justified. \n\nI don't think you should feel obliged to spend your professional capital on supporting her.", "NAH. She sounds like a classic case of undiagnosed ADHD. Here's the thing, some people's brains are literally wired differently. They are better at some things and worse at others. ADHD is a dopamine deficiency and it can express itself in so many ways. People with ADHD also tend to be hyper aware that their struggle to do totally normal things makes people resent them so we wind up with a ton of self hatred as well. I personally don't think there is even anything wrong with that kind of brain, but unfortunately we still have to function within certain parameters that are difficult. It may be worth looking into resources for working with people with ADHD because if you can find some wiggle room and help take advantage of the amazing thinking that can happen in that kind of brain, it can help bring about great ideas and innovative solutions.  \n\nThe only thing that stuck out was your mention of outing a coworker, which is a terrible thing to do no matter who you are.  However your question was about her write up over being late so I am just trying to judge that.", "NTA.  She asked, you answered and she didn\u2019t like the answer.

She brought it up and you were professional in your response.  \n\nHowever, she doesn't seem mature enough to handle your response.  If your company has an Ombusman/Ombuswoman, I'd reach out and talk about everything you discussed here and ask them what the best approach with her is so that you can keep the coworker at arms length while still doing your best work, since it sounds like the two of you must work together in some capacity.  Just make sure that when her ship sinks, you donl't go down with it.", "I think what people miss is \"creative\" is often neurodivergent.

I'm sure HR knows all about her.\n\nI worked in an officer once where a girl just stopped coming in. 4 months later out of the blue she contacted the boss and asked him if he could write a letter of recommendation. We had a lotta laughs over that one.", "NTA she asked and you answered. However it sounds like she might be struggling with some form of undiagnosed adhd. I have a friend who is just like this and no matter what we did we could not get her to turn up on time to things. She\u2019s now been diagnosed with adhd. \n\nShe needs to get her self together though or she\u2019s never going to progress.

She needs to be gone yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, you're picking up Marie's slack and covering for her?  Stop it.  \n\nI think it might be time for you to quit trying to deal with the problem with Marie by giving her direct feedback.  (You've already tried and failed to get through to her.)  I think you might want to let your manager and HR know exactly what's going on, with documentation if possible.  If only as a defensive move as you know that even though she can't be bothered to show up on time for meeting, she'll make the effort to throw you under the bus if she thinks it will benefit her or if you hurt her feelings.
