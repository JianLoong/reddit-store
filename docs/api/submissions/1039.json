Now as far as I know they share an account for daily expenses but her personal bank account is private and her husband has no access to it. I asked why he thought I could help and he said he knew I had that info. I apologized and refused to give it to him.\n\n\nThis morning, he came knocking on my door asking for the info again and insisting I give it to him. I refused but he ranted about wanting to check on some urgent stuff and had no time to call her and burden her with \"nonsensical issues as that\" I refused but he lashed out asking who tf I thought I was to come between him and his wife. I said he needed to wait for her to return and that no one was coming between them but she has boundaries. We had an argument and he left but he texted me saying I'm being petty and toxic to show this amount of blatant distrust and disrespect.\n\nAt the end of the day, he's her husband even though she's incredibly private especially with her finances.

I know we shouldn't presume motives, but if he's getting that angry, I worry that he's on the verge of leaving her and wants to clean out her account on the way out the door.\n\nThat \"didn't have time to call her\" is obviously BS.  Since you said he first called \"the other day\" and then came by \"this morning,\" he's had plenty of time. Don't violate your friend's privacy.  She's locked this account down for a reason.  And be ready to emotionally support her when the true reason behind his demands comes to light.\n\nEdited to add:  Tell your friend to go through the shared account for additional red flags.", "NTA\n\nHeck no. And why haven't you called her up and told her that her husband is asking for this information? This is worthwhile to \"disrupt\" her trip.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a reason he doesn't have access to it.  \n\nThis is very overbearing, controlling and manipulative behaviour for someone to be doing to a partner let alone just a friend.

Absolutely do not give him any information, and protect yourself.", "NTA. It' SO urgent that he can't call his wife. But he can storm your house trying to her his wife's information and who knows what he would do if he had the password.\n\nI'm wondering if he called you, after his attempts at home to get into her account failed. And your friend must keep things locked up to keep her privacy. I would be sure to tell your friend about what her husband was doing.", "NTA.  What a bully!  He had time to come to your house and rant at you but not call his wife?!? Sounds like some pretty bad intentions on his part.  Stand your ground and let his wife deal with him.", "NTA, but tell as soon as she gets back. Damn, this man is trying to rob her!!!", "NTA. You didn't overstep at all. The husband put pressure on you at the moment he thought he could get away with it. Let us know how your friend feels about it when you tell her in a couple of days.", "NTA! One of the big problems women had in the past was not being able to keep their own money. Even if they had a job or bank account their men could go right in and empty it without their knowledge or consent. Other women would either have to hand their money over when they got home, or even worse - their employer would put their pay straight into their husband\u2019s or father\u2019s hand and she never got to touch her pay at all. The integrity of a person\u2019s accounts should be maintained no matter what. You are a good friend for saying no to the hubby - maybe it was innocent, but better safe than sorry when it comes to the possibility of her losing her money. Hopefully you emailed her straight away about the incident.", "NTA at all.  There's a reason why your friend's husband doesn't have her log in information and that's because she doesn't want him to have.  And if he wants it, he needs to have that conversation with her, not you.  I would definitely let her know about this situation (including him showing up at your house, wowza!) as soon as possible.  I don't know what this man is planning, but it sure gives off bad vibes.", "NTA. Couples are all different in the ways and reasons for the way they handle finance, but if they have separate accounts where one spouse has not given access to the other, the other spouse does not have the right to try to obtain that ability from a third party. In fact, it\u2019s shady as hell. He is not asking your friend to check for him or for login privileges. He\u2019s trying to get that from you _without_ _her_ _knowledge_. You _are_ honoring trust and showing respect\u2026for your friend.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your friend about this interaction imo. This behavior is strange.", "YOU DID THE RIGHT THING! \n\nHe overstepped, not you. Your friend\u2019s husband is being fishy.", "NTA, and you should let her know immediately, because he's probably trying to find another way to get access to her account while she's out of town. This is shady af. My first thought was that he wanted to clean out her account and take off. Any chance he's cheating?", "INFO: I saw something almost just like this awhile ago, so at what point do any of you reach out to your friend? It\u2019s a funeral people can talk and text out of town\u2026.", "NTA and when she gets back you should tell her about this.", "NTA it's not your place to give it to him have you spoken with your friend about his behavior?", "NTA.  This read like a real life spam email from the Prince of Twatdom asking for help as it's needed to help his kingdom. \n\nGlad you stuck to your guns. He is up to something fishy.   \nI'd def tell your friend and show her the texts.  Check in on her, make sure she's safe and okay.", "No, you didn't overstep at all. \n\nHe knows his wife is not going to share that info with him for some good reason.", "NTA.

Your friend wasn't at the funeral for 24 hrs and he could've called her for the access he wanted or the info he needed. They have separate accounts.

What if he gambled away their joint account and his account and is trying to get her cash to gamble it away too.", "NTA - this is concerning, give him no info. None at all.", "NTA\n\nI mean, it says a lot about their relationship that she gave you that information and not him.

That makes no sense at all.\n\nSomething is really off here, and I am betting your friend will be very grateful that you didn't fall for this.", "Absolute NTA.  Maybe he was looking to transfer money from her account to his account.  Maybe he gambles. Maybe he's cheating and wanted to spend money on his new woman. Maybe he borrowed money from a loan shark.  You should let her know sooner rather than later in the event he goes to the bank to try to social engineer them out of that information.", "NTA. If it\u2019s important enough for him to come over and harass you, it\u2019s important enough to call her, family funeral or no. If she wanted him to have the info he would have had it. Apparently you have it so there\u2019s more of a story there with husband", "NTA. Giving him that information would be illegal and a massive breach of trust.", "NTA. I think we all know what's going to happen when she gets back and you tell her what he did.", "NTA, sounds like you did the right thing OP.", "Wait why do you feel like you overstepped? NTA. Something\u2019s fishy.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. Tell your friend when she gets back that hubby was pestering you for account info on HER account. He waits until she's gone to do this, probably wants to do something bad.", "NTA. This is extremely fishy, and you did well to *not* give in. Your instincts were correct.\n\nIf something is so urgent that he *needs* to get into her account, then it's urgent enough for him to call her. If it's not that urgent, then he can wait to get that information.\n\nSeriously, his actions are at odds with his explanations. The most likely explanation is that he's planning to do something to her money that he knows she wouldn't approve, and he sees this as his one opportunity to get at \"his\" money.\n\nTell your friend about this immediately. It's her account. The decision to share any information about it is entirely hers to make alone.", "NTA at all, if your friend never told you this was something she would want, why would you give him this information? She is out of town, not in a coma or deceased. It doesn't make any sense why he would not reach out to her first if he had TIME to come to your door (and be angry, which is such a huge red flag). I would call or text this friend immediately and let them know about this alarming situation. I know I would want to know.", "NTA. He is abusive and toxic. \nI would tell my friend immediately. \n\nI am very private with my finances, my partner and I keep them separately, and I cannot imagine this man confidently going to one of my friends demanding my private info and expecting anything but immediate anger and the possible termination of our relationship.", "NTA, but even with her being at a family funeral, it seems silly that you wouldn't have reached out to check in with her about it after the first time. She deserves to know that he's asking, and it would put your mind at rest.", "NTA\n\nIs it urgent or is it nonsensical?  You know the dude is up to something absolutely shady because his own story is contradictory.\n\nIf it's urgent, he can call his wife.  If it's nonsense, then it can wait until she comes home.  There is no circumstance he can create that would legitimately require you to give him your friend's banking info.\n\nSo he decided to intimidate you into giving in.\n\nDon't, and definitely inform your friend.

You need to tell your friend ASAP about this.", "This reminds me so much of the post last month where the boyfriend wanted to be let into the sister\u2019s safe right when she left town. NTA", "If he has time to drive to your house in badger you in person about getting her information he has the time to call her bypassing the wanting to not be a burden on her at the moment. Do you know how long it takes to text someone? A lot less time than it does to drive over to someone else's house and knock on their door.", "NTA \n\nYou would have overstepped if you had shared the bank information. You would have inserted yourself in their marriage if you had  given him the information.", "If he has no access to that account, then hire wood he know anything urgent is going on with it. Dude thinks she\u2019s cheating and looking for evidence or was going to drain her bank account. I\u2019d be telling my friend asap when she gets back.", "Please tell her what he\u2019s doing. There are some huge red flags with his behavior and she deserves to know about it. NTA, you\u2019re being a great friend.", "NTA. You need to let her know right away this is happening.", "NTA.  You are a GOOD friend, don\u2019t forget that. You owe him nothing.  You did right by having her back.", "NTA - if it was actually important, he would have asked you to log in and check for the transaction. There is some serious problems in their relationship. Stick up for your friend and avoid that lying husband.", "NTA if she gived you the info is because she knew this could happen and you're trustworthy.", "NTA. I would call your friend and tell het this immediately. Something is up and she needs to know about it.", "Nta. Please contact her so she can take proper precautions.", "NTA\n\nLet your friend now that her husband has been pressuring you - to the point of coming over to your house - to give him your bank information.\n\nHe's planning something ugly.   Really ugly.", "He's the A. No reason for him to have that info, especially through you. Sounds like he's trying to move funds, (maybe he cracked her passwords), or will throw her under the bus somehow. I would advise the friend, before she gets home.", "NTA and make sure you tell your friend what her husband tried to do when she was out of town.", "He wants the money so he control her.", "NTA...you absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA I think he wants her money. If she wanted him in her account she would have given him the info. Don't give him any info. And let her know what he tried to do when she gets back. He is an AH.", "The fact that HE WENT TO YOUR HOUSE is absolutely not okay!!! NTA at all but you definitely need to your friend about his behavior", "You know, wives that go missing often \"\"\"\"\"\"leave town\"\"\"\"\".\n\nCall your friend. \n\nNTA he is being shady and creepy and I get very bad vibes from this.", "INFO: Have you told your friend he's asked? Because that should be your first step.\n\nI see only three plausible reasons for this:\n\nHe suspects her if something (over-spending or cheating)\n\nHe plans to leave, but wants to take all her money\n\nHe wants to somehow use this information to put her in a financially abusive relationship\n\nRegardless of the reason, your did the right thing. Now get off reddit and tell your friend what he's doing.", "NTA. It's obvious he doesn't have his wife's permission to get into that account. That's why he waited until she was out of town to try to trick and bully you. It's scary that he came to your house. Make sure you record any further communication with him. And call your friend to warn her.", "It's not your right to give the husband private information like that. He needs to get it from his wife, no one else. But, he's also wrong for stating that you were coming between him and his wife because you wouldn't give him what he needed.\n\nKnowing this much, I now wonder if he had a deeper reason for needing that info. Is he suspicious of something? Is there something going on that he needs to find answers to, and perhaps you might not be aware of it either? \n\nIMHO, I wouldn't want to know any private info like bank accounts and such - because it's not my place to know it in the first place.", "NTA. So he just needs to \u201ccheck something\u201d but waited until his wife left down. This \u201csomething\u201d is apparently not important enough for him to just call his wife, ya know\u2026.the person with the account info, but it *is* somehow urgent and important enough for him to come intimidate you in your home about it? None of this makes any sense. What kind of urgent unimportant business is this", "Overstepped what?  It's HER account!  He doesn't have the right to access HER account.  NTA, and make sure to tell your friend he did this.  Ignore his insults, they mean nothing.", "There are a few options, but none of them good.  He may want to steal from her personal account.  He may be trying to check up on her.  He may be cheating, and trying to make it look like she is as well to shift blame.  He may be trying to prevent her from doing something, including leaving him.  If he really wanted to know something that urgently, he could have asked you to look into it - but that is not why he was there.  NTA and you need to tell your friend what happened so she is prepared when she gets back.  And do not open the door for him again, for your own safety.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t have time to call her but he had time to drop off unannounced. You need to call her  ASAP. idk if you\u2019re close or not but if a man comes to my house and is angry I\u2019ll be scared.", "You didn't overstep. He did. You are a good friend. But let her know what happened. NTA.", "NTA If it wasn't important enough for him to call her directly, it wasn't urgent enough for you to violate your friend's trust.", "NTA He \u201cdoesn\u2019t have time to call her\u201d but has to time to get in his car, drive to your house and have a tantrum? Something doesn\u2019t add up there. He\u2019s very obviously up to something and you definitely don\u2019t want to be involved in whatever it is, and should probably call your friend to give her a heads up about what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m sure she would rather take a phone call from you even though she\u2019s out of town than come home to whatever mess he\u2019s got going on.", "NTA.  It's very simple.  You do not have the right to share that info with him.  Him getting angry and accusing you of distrust and disrespect is absolutely ridiculous because trust and respect has nothing to do with anything.  You do not have the right or authority to share that information, even if you completely trusted and respected him.\n\nAbsolutely let your friend know about every single detail of this.  You may even consider letting her know about it this very minute.", "NTA. If it\u2019s urgent and important then she should contact his wife. Not try to bully his wife\u2019s friend!\n\nPlease tell you friend all that he did and show her the messages he sent you. Even if he had nothing to hide, he handled this very poorly and has anger issues.", "Bruh this is the third post I\u2019ve come across with similar stories. Bestie goes out of town and all of a sudden the SO harasses trusted friend for slamming into a boundary.", "> he ranted about wanting to check on some urgent stuff and had no time to call her and burden her with \"nonsensical issues as that\"\n\nIt was so urgent that he drove to your house to argue with you when he could have just called his wife?? My spideysense is tingling here. \n\nThis dude is shady AF. You made the right call. Let your friend know asap. NTA", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. I know you don't want to bother her during a difficult time of loss but if I were your friend I would probably want to know this is happening.\n\nIf I were you, I would text your friend and just say that when she has some time free and it is convenient, to please call you. Then let her know. Or somehow contact her but don't send her something that seems like a 4 alarm emergency, in case the timing is awful. To avoid piling on stress and drama, for example, right in the middle of a funeral. But she should know that her husband is trying to get into her bank account, in case there are other people who he might ask.\n\nHe hasn't provided any sufficient explanation why he should have access to this information, so definitely don't give it to him.", "NTA. \nSo I work at a bank, and in our policies and procedures it is a breach of privacy to give away a clients info EVEN TO THEIR SPOUSE", "NTA - bank info is private. If she wanted him to have access, she would have given it to him. Wow. Just wow.", "NTA if she wanted him to have it she would have given it to him.", "Yes, Opie, please tell your friend immediately and then update us right after with how that went. I mean after the funeral of course", "Op should have called friend then and there.", "NTA, totally not your place. Why didn\u2019t his wife give it to him a long time ago?", "He doesn\u2019t have time to call his wife but somehow finds the time to drive to op\u2019s house and harass her? NTA. If it\u2019s so urgent he needs it immediately it\u2019s worth bothering his wife for it.", "He couldn't empty it if he wasn't on the account. He didn't have the account info, so he wasn't on it", "If it's nonsensical..  then it can wait buddy.", "Just physical intimidation after being told no. He's just a tool", "Yes!! This feels EXACTLY like the post about the friend who had a safe with some valuables in it and only she and the best friend had the combination. I can't remember the title, but the husband/BF/fianc\u00e9 started asking for the combo immediately after his wife/OP's friend goes out of town for work or a family event or something similar, and even comes to their home to harrass them for it because he just needed to \"check something\" and didn't want to bother his wife over it. I'm pretty sure it's the exact same post but it's a bank account instead of a safe or lockbox...", "This is shady af. OP please tell your friend and show the text messages.", "So urgent he could wait a couple days to come and ask again \ud83d\ude44", "[removed]", "Not legally, but if he got the account info and was able to login, he could transfer money from her account to himself. He\u2019s up to something, and I wouldn\u2019t be sure that the legalities would bother him.", "Also so urgent, he has \"no time\" to call his wife but has time to call OP, argue with her, wait until the next morning, come to her home and continue arguing. \n\nHe is lying and plans to do something shady.", ">NTA. This is suspicious. Why won't he say what he wants to check? If it is urgent and can't wait why can't he contact her?\n\nHe either wants to steal from her or to \"prove\" she is cheating on him..."]}
