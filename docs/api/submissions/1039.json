Now as far as I know they share an account for daily expenses but her personal bank account is private and her husband has no access to it. I asked why he thought I could help and he said he knew I had that info. I apologized and refused to give it to him.\n\n\nThis morning, he came knocking on my door asking for the info again and insisting I give it to him. I refused but he ranted about wanting to check on some urgent stuff and had no time to call her and burden her with \"nonsensical issues as that\" I refused but he lashed out asking who tf I thought I was to come between him and his wife. I said he needed to wait for her to return and that no one was coming between them but she has boundaries. We had an argument and he left but he texted me saying I'm being petty and toxic to show this amount of blatant distrust and disrespect.\n\nAt the end of the day, he's her husband even though she's incredibly private especially with her finances.

I know we shouldn't presume motives, but if he's getting that angry, I worry that he's on the verge of leaving her and wants to clean out her account on the way out the door.\n\nThat \"didn't have time to call her\" is obviously BS.  Since you said he first called \"the other day\" and then came by \"this morning,\" he's had plenty of time. Don't violate your friend's privacy.  She's locked this account down for a reason.  And be ready to emotionally support her when the true reason behind his demands comes to light.\n\nEdited to add:  Tell your friend to go through the shared account for additional red flags.", "NTA\n\nHeck no. And why haven't you called her up and told her that her husband is asking for this information? This is worthwhile to \"disrupt\" her trip.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a reason he doesn't have access to it.  \n\nThis is very overbearing, controlling and manipulative behaviour for someone to be doing to a partner let alone just a friend.

Absolutely do not give him any information, and protect yourself.", "NTA. It' SO urgent that he can't call his wife. But he can storm your house trying to her his wife's information and who knows what he would do if he had the password.\n\nI'm wondering if he called you, after his attempts at home to get into her account failed. And your friend must keep things locked up to keep her privacy. I would be sure to tell your friend about what her husband was doing.", "NTA.  What a bully!  He had time to come to your house and rant at you but not call his wife?!? Sounds like some pretty bad intentions on his part.  Stand your ground and let his wife deal with him.", "NTA, but tell as soon as she gets back. Damn, this man is trying to rob her!!!", "NTA. You didn't overstep at all. The husband put pressure on you at the moment he thought he could get away with it. Let us know how your friend feels about it when you tell her in a couple of days.", "NTA! One of the big problems women had in the past was not being able to keep their own money. Even if they had a job or bank account their men could go right in and empty it without their knowledge or consent. Other women would either have to hand their money over when they got home, or even worse - their employer would put their pay straight into their husband\u2019s or father\u2019s hand and she never got to touch her pay at all. The integrity of a person\u2019s accounts should be maintained no matter what. You are a good friend for saying no to the hubby - maybe it was innocent, but better safe than sorry when it comes to the possibility of her losing her money. Hopefully you emailed her straight away about the incident.", "NTA at all.  There's a reason why your friend's husband doesn't have her log in information and that's because she doesn't want him to have.  And if he wants it, he needs to have that conversation with her, not you.  I would definitely let her know about this situation (including him showing up at your house, wowza!) as soon as possible.  I don't know what this man is planning, but it sure gives off bad vibes.", "NTA. Couples are all different in the ways and reasons for the way they handle finance, but if they have separate accounts where one spouse has not given access to the other, the other spouse does not have the right to try to obtain that ability from a third party. In fact, it\u2019s shady as hell. He is not asking your friend to check for him or for login privileges. He\u2019s trying to get that from you _without_ _her_ _knowledge_. You _are_ honoring trust and showing respect\u2026for your friend.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your friend about this interaction imo. This behavior is strange.", "YOU DID THE RIGHT THING! \n\nHe overstepped, not you. Your friend\u2019s husband is being fishy.", "NTA, and you should let her know immediately, because he's probably trying to find another way to get access to her account while she's out of town. This is shady af. My first thought was that he wanted to clean out her account and take off. Any chance he's cheating?", "INFO: I saw something almost just like this awhile ago, so at what point do any of you reach out to your friend? It\u2019s a funeral people can talk and text out of town\u2026.", "NTA and when she gets back you should tell her about this.", "NTA it's not your place to give it to him have you spoken with your friend about his behavior?", "NTA.  This read like a real life spam email from the Prince of Twatdom asking for help as it's needed to help his kingdom. \n\nGlad you stuck to your guns. He is up to something fishy.   \nI'd def tell your friend and show her the texts.  Check in on her, make sure she's safe and okay.", "No, you didn't overstep at all. \n\nHe knows his wife is not going to share that info with him for some good reason.", "NTA.

Your friend wasn't at the funeral for 24 hrs and he could've called her for the access he wanted or the info he needed. They have separate accounts.

What if he gambled away their joint account and his account and is trying to get her cash to gamble it away too.", "NTA - this is concerning, give him no info. None at all.", "NTA\n\nI mean, it says a lot about their relationship that she gave you that information and not him.

That makes no sense at all.\n\nSomething is really off here, and I am betting your friend will be very grateful that you didn't fall for this.", "Absolute NTA.  Maybe he was looking to transfer money from her account to his account.  Maybe he gambles. Maybe he's cheating and wanted to spend money on his new woman. Maybe he borrowed money from a loan shark.  You should let her know sooner rather than later in the event he goes to the bank to try to social engineer them out of that information.", "NTA. If it\u2019s important enough for him to come over and harass you, it\u2019s important enough to call her, family funeral or no. If she wanted him to have the info he would have had it. Apparently you have it so there\u2019s more of a story there with husband", "NTA. Giving him that information would be illegal and a massive breach of trust.", "NTA. I think we all know what's going to happen when she gets back and you tell her what he did.", "NTA, sounds like you did the right thing OP.", "Wait why do you feel like you overstepped? NTA. Something\u2019s fishy.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. Tell your friend when she gets back that hubby was pestering you for account info on HER account. He waits until she's gone to do this, probably wants to do something bad.", "NTA. This is extremely fishy, and you did well to *not* give in. Your instincts were correct.\n\nIf something is so urgent that he *needs* to get into her account, then it's urgent enough for him to call her. If it's not that urgent, then he can wait to get that information.\n\nSeriously, his actions are at odds with his explanations. The most likely explanation is that he's planning to do something to her money that he knows she wouldn't approve, and he sees this as his one opportunity to get at \"his\" money.\n\nTell your friend about this immediately. It's her account. The decision to share any information about it is entirely hers to make alone.", "NTA at all, if your friend never told you this was something she would want, why would you give him this information? She is out of town, not in a coma or deceased. It doesn't make any sense why he would not reach out to her first if he had TIME to come to your door (and be angry, which is such a huge red flag). I would call or text this friend immediately and let them know about this alarming situation. I know I would want to know.", "NTA. He is abusive and toxic. \nI would tell my friend immediately. \n\nI am very private with my finances, my partner and I keep them separately, and I cannot imagine this man confidently going to one of my friends demanding my private info and expecting anything but immediate anger and the possible termination of our relationship.", "NTA, but even with her being at a family funeral, it seems silly that you wouldn't have reached out to check in with her about it after the first time. She deserves to know that he's asking, and it would put your mind at rest.", "NTA\n\nIs it urgent or is it nonsensical?  You know the dude is up to something absolutely shady because his own story is contradictory.\n\nIf it's urgent, he can call his wife.  If it's nonsense, then it can wait until she comes home.  There is no circumstance he can create that would legitimately require you to give him your friend's banking info.\n\nSo he decided to intimidate you into giving in.\n\nDon't, and definitely inform your friend.

No how. \n\nI would ONLY release that information to him if a) your friend requests that you do so via video chat or b) she requests that you do so whilst standing next to you. \n\nThe fact that he became argumentative and belligerent shows that he may very well be up to no good. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your friend inadvertently placed this burden on you, but at least you both know you are reliable and trustworthy.\n\nETA \u2014 Not to get all \u201cI watch too much true crime stuff\u201d but are you 100% sure she is out of town? Like did she tell you with her own mouth? \n\nI\u2019d hate to interrupt her while she\u2019s attending to emotional personal business but I think you should try to call her and update you.

Why is your friend in this marriage?", "NTA\n\nHe was trying to go around her through you to steal her money. Period. You did exactly the right thing. She clearly chose not to share that info with her husband. This could be her emergency fund to leave him if he gets too abusive. PLEASE don't betray your friend by giving him this information. He absolutely could have called or texted her for this information, and would have, if he wasn't being a sneak.

Good job being a good friend.", "Nta-there's something fishy what until your friend gets home to talk to her or if you feel it important text her let her decide but keep the info safe", "NTA. He\u2019s lying, obviously. If he\u2019s talking to you that way, imagine what kind of nightmare he is with her in private. If he shows up again, call the police. Continue to be a good friend.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds dodgy. It sounds like he's planning on stealing from her and is using you to do it. \n\nIt reminds me of when a friend of my aunts had her ex boyfriend steal money from her before leaving her. He wanted to rinse her dry, and he managed it as it was back when you got bank statements as letters. Then left to be with his new girlfriend.\n\nI'd send her a message and tell her you're worried because her husband is harassing you for her bank details and claiming he can't contact her because she's busy. \n\nTell her when she's back you want to talk to her. \n\nWhen you see her ask her if there's been any financial changes to either of them.\n\nAsk if there's a chance he's planning on leaving and would empty out her account. \n\nAsk her what steps she's making to be careful and really drive home how much he was trying to intimidate you. If this wasn't something dodgy, he'd have contacted her already and sorted it out.\n\nTell her to be careful moving forward, because he'll expect you both to talk so might figure out a reasonable excuse and keep his head down for a bit. Also, she needs to do a credit check, you can open up credit cards online now and he might try it.", "If it was an important situation, he could reach out to his wife. If it's \"nonsensical\" it can wait. NTA, you made the right call. Dude's being fishy.", "You need to let her know immediately. Funeral or not.", "NTA. I suspect there's a good damn reason she doesn't give him that info. If it was so \"nonsensical\" then why is it so urgent he access it right now?? Methinks your friend will need more of your help shortly when she divorces this walking marinara flag. Kudos to you for being a good friend.", "You\u2019re a good friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t give it to him either. That whole situation is creepy.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to do something shady behind her back. \n\nNo matter what the situation, it\u2019s not hard to send a quick 2 minute text to get permission. \n\nI had a major part in a funeral recently, and though I didn\u2019t answer the phone often, I did reply to all texts within an hour or two. \n\nTell your friend about this interaction when she\u2019s back.", "NTA, obviously you should tell you\u2019re friend he\u2019s trying to get it and ask her if she wants you to share it with him or not.", "NTA his anger is strong suspicion.  Why on earth does a Friend have access and not the husband?  That alone tells you nta.", "NTA If he doesn't have the info it means she didn't give it to him for a reason.  He also waited until she was out of town.  If it was so urgent he could shoot her a text instead of showing up at your home.  He says its urgent but then says it's nonsensical, so which is it dude?

You cannot tell me, in this day and age, that he had no cell contact with his wife.

If he has problems with money, they need to be seeing a therapist!\\~", " NTA but I hope that you update us when you hear from your friend.

I am glad you stood your ground.", "NTA, he wants to know if she's actually at a funeral or not and wants to use her account activity to \"prove\" something. That or he's trying to steal money from her....either way give her the heads up NOW because regardless the behavior is a HUGE \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. That man was just trying to be sneaky. If he wanted the info he could text his wife and she could respond in time. He probably suspects her if cheating, which means that he is probably actually cheating \ud83d\ude44.

You don't give away that info without the person's permission, even if it is to their spouse.", "NTA He\u2019s definitely acting sus. If it\u2019s urgent, how is it also nonsensical.

If she wanted him to have that account info, she could give it to him. It\u2019s easy. \n\nNo, he \u201cneeds\u201d that info because he either has a gambling debt to pay, a drug habit to support, a mistress to impress, or some other vice that he\u2019d rather she not know about. \n\nAlternately, he wants that account info because he thinks she\u2019s cheating on him and wants to prove it with transaction history. Or he think she makes way more money / has way more money than him, and he\u2019s jealous. \n\nThese are all \u201chim/them\u201d issues. But you need to tell your friend about this ASAP. Send her the screenshots of the texts, tell her what he\u2019s doing, and make sure she has her credit frozen.

That's her account, not his.", "NTA but you should have said you didn\u2019t know.", "**NTA**\n\nThere is nothing he could possibly need to \"check\" in HER PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT, because it has nothing to do with him, much less that he would need to check on urgently.\n\nAnd if he did need to \"urgently check something\" in her personal bank account, it could only possibly have to be at her behest, so she would have given him the information.\n\nThe fact that she hasn't given him access de facto indicates that he is trying to \"check\" on something that is none of his damn business. \n\nAs others have noted, you did the right thing. If she wanted him to have access to her account, he'd already have it. The only possible reason for him to come to you is because he's going behind her back.

I wouldn\u2019t do that either", "You need to tell your friend ASAP", "Where did the wife go that he couldn't get her on a phone/text/email? A convent? A monastery? She should probably stay there!", "NTA. If he tries in person again, call your friend on speakerphone. She needs to know ASAP. This is sketchy AF.", "NTA. Call her immediately and tell her.", "NTA. He is a walking, talking red flag. Let her know as soon as she returns.", "NTA, but people don't share you account login information with anyone, even your bestie.", "NTA at all. He should be getting that info from her directly. Asking you is weird and in bad taste. You shouldn't be in the middle of that at all.", "NTA.  If she wanted him to know this stuff, she would have shared it with him.  If it was so important that he not only called you, but came to your home, he should have just called his wife.  This is very strange and just has 'red flags' all over it.  Text her, just asking how she is doing, how the funeral is going and if she needs anything from you.  I would also ask her to give you a call when she has time, as you have a question to ask her.  When she does call, lay out exactly what happened between you and her husband and ask her if you should give him her banking information.  Leave it at that and do as she requests.  BTW, you're a great friend.", "He\u2019s either planning on cleaning her out before he leaves her, or he is an addict and ran out of funds, or he has debts he needs to pay off now (gambling maybe).

He\u2019s probably cheating and projecting on her and looking for evidence that she is cheating so he can be the victim.", "Absolutely NTA. And there\u2019s definitely something sketchy with him and his behavior!

It will have to wait.", "Good lookin out OP. You are a true friend.", "You did the right thing. He probably thinks she is cheating and wanted to \u201ccheck\u201d where she is spending the money.

You should have definitely escalated to her again after he showed up at your door.", "NTA. You did not overstep, you're being a VERY good friend. Why you have the banking info in the first place, I don't understand, but it also doesn't matter.

I'd be letting the friend know ASAP too because something suspicious is going on. He's 100% on the wrong here but why do you have her bank info lol?", "NTA!  Huge red flag. Bank Manager here. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re married or not, if you aren\u2019t on the account, you\u2019re not getting the info.", "NTA.  You did not overstep.

Either he suspects her of something or he wants access to her funds.\n\nHas your friend ever talked about him being jealous, controlling, or accusing her of cheating? Has she expressed he is bad with money? \n\nI would hate to interrupt her at a funeral, but I\u2019ll be honest she needs to know about this asap. If he\u2019s tried you he\u2019ll likely try her bank. And while they *shouldnt* be giving him that access people make dumb mistakes all the time. Especially when people are pushy.", "NTA. They have separate and joint finances for a reason. If it was so nonsensical for him to bother her with, why was it so important that he had to come and try to physically intimidate you into giving it to him. You're a good friend, OP. You did what your friend asked you to do and kept her information secret and safe. She trusts you for a reason and if he had an actual good reason for it, he'dve given it. She has a reason for separate finances, and for all you know, he could have a gambling problem and wants to drain her dry. Or could be leaving her/has a mistress and needs more  money. Money that he's clearly not entitled to. He's not permitted to 'log in and check something'. You could do that for him. The fact he's being so cagey with it proves it's shady. I smell a rat.", "NTA, this is so sketchy. Plus you are very much not coming between a husband and his wife by not getting yourself involved in their financial issues and asking him to sort it out between him and his wife, without involving you in any way.", "Nta but you need to tell her what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. Let your friend know what her husband tried to do.", "My H doesn't have access to my bank account but has received transfers over the years so he would be able to figure it out if he needed to (maybe).  But he also knows it wouldn't be worth the trouble.", "NTA. She trusts you with her bank account details and not her husband.  That proves you were right not to tell him.  But please find a way to tell her what happened before she gets back.", "NTA", "NTA but he is up to no good...", "NTA - If she wanted him to have the information she would have given it to him.

If she wanted him to have access to it, it would be a joint account.", "NTA- If what he needed to \u201ccheck\u201d was so \u201curgent\u201d, then he should feel comfortable reaching out to his wife for the information even if she\u2019s busy. \nYou should let your friend know about his behavior.

Why the heck is he not with her at that family funeral?", "Agreed.  if the sky was falling, he could call her.\n\nPLEASE tell your friend when she gets back what happened.", "Agreed. But let me add in that is more likely he is up to something shady. In fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say that he\u2019s definitely up to something shady. Why did he wait until she had a death in the family to need this info. Why did he wait until she was out of town?  Why can\u2019t he text wife to call, when she has a second, as he needs to talk to her about a bank account issue. \n\nHe\u2019s either going to get info, so he can use it against her later, or he\u2019s going to clear her accounts out. Those are the only two possible reasons I can think of for him to get into her separate accounts. \n\nTo OP. NTA but you absolutely need to let your friend know about this right NOW.
