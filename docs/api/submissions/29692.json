My oldest sister and youngest brother was at school that day and we had a day off. We found a piece of paper with her handwriting with the details to the credit card. \n\nWhen I was 12-years-old my mother got her first ever credit card to try and rebuild her credit score as we grew up poor. My mother had a $200 maximum to spend on there and one day me and her were getting ready to go out food shopping. \n\nWe went to check out at our supermarket and the card was declining. Mum was embarrassed and had to leave everything behind. She got home and called up her credit card company to find out my sister had somehow spent $200 on the app store in a space of less than 20 minutes. \n\nIt was safe to say I was pissed of. I was my mother's carer as she was poorly for a while so I understood the importance of money and $200 was and still is a lot of money. \n\nThe thing is I have two sisters who are both older than me and a younger brother. My middle sister was the one who spent $200 on the app store. At the time my mother shouted at her once but didn't punish her which left me being angry as I had to try and find away to make money last and all I wanted to do was ground her buy my mother refused to allow it and let her do what she wanted. \n\nI still haven't forgiven her for it and I can't forget it; it's always on the back of my mind. Which brings us up to now. \n\nMy middle sister name was spelt wrong on her birth certificate which meant we couldn't set up a bank account for her. It took us a long time, many years, but we're finally getting it corrected. My sister was successful in getting her first ever job and hasn't got a bank account. She asked our oldest sister if she could use her card by my oldest sister only has one bank account and one card so she told my middle sister to ask me. I have two bank accounts so I could give her one card to use temporarily whilst she waits for her name to be corrected so she can apply to get ID and open a bank account but I just can't get over what happened ten years ago and said no. \n\nMy brother is on my side but my sisters are saying I'm being an asshole for not forgetting a thing that happened ten years ago and that I'm an idiot for not getting over it. \n\nSo Reddit, what do you think?

Has your sister ever shown any remorse for her actions or tried to repay your mom?", "If your sister wanted your trust she shouldn't have stolen from family and forced you all to struggle for it. You were 12 and knew stealing is wrong, yet somehow your older sister didn't get the memo? NTA", "NTA- if your other sister cares so much she should suck it up and give over hers , or STFU !!!\n\nNo I would not give her mine if I were you , she had ZERO consequences last time , why wouldn\u2019t she do if again!!!", "ESH. You for holding a kid\u2019s mistake over the head of an adult (not for not sharing your card, that\u2019s a personal decision); your mom is TA for not correcting the name issue when it first came up; and your sister is TA for assuming she can piggy-back on other people\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nIs there a reason she can\u2019t just transfer you guys the money and get cash from any of you instead? It feels like there\u2019s a much more simple solution than her getting access to someone else\u2019s accounts", "ESH: it's your bank account and they are not entitled to it, so they shouldnt push. alternately, it sounds like she was a teenager when it happened, and while yes it was ridiculously stupid of her to do, I can attest (as a teen myself) that a lot of teenagers go through at least one ridiculously stupid phase. By no means do you have to forgive her, thats a personal process, and you definitely don't have to let her use your bank account, but there was definitely a soft yta moment bringing that back up. She's had a lot of brain development time since then, and people dredging up actions from the distant past can be very embarrassing and hurtful. Nta for declining and not forgiving, but kind of yta for bringing up something from before her prefrontal cortex was developed as your reasoning.", "YTA for holding on to something that happened 10 years ago. You are harming yourself by continuing to obsess over this. 10 years is a long time to worry about someone inappropriately spending $200, especially given the fact it wasn't even your money.", "INFO How old was your sister when she did it? If she was like 14 and since then she never did anything similar then you would be AS for this.", "YTA for being so unreasonable and still holding onto this. People make mistakes. If she hasn't given you a reason to actually believe she'd still be irresponsible, you need to move on. Especially considering this wasn't even something that happened to you. You honestly sound like you're overstepping a lot. You're not the parent, OP. You don't get to ground your sister.", "YTA - imagine someone holding a grudge against you for years after something you did as a stupid teen.", "Around ten years since it happened.", "And how does she behave with money now? Did she ever do something this irresponsible again?", "NTA\n\nYour sisters name is spelt wrong on her birth cert. Is not an actual problem for a bank if your sister just signs her name as it's spelt on her birth cert. \n\nYou can also get that corrected by deed poll in *most* countries for a very cheap fee, from $10-$60 usually around 25-35 though. Then she has to request new IDs with her new name or if she already has them in that name, present them with the updated docs. Job done! \n\nBut NTA on not trusting her. I wouldn't.", "In my opinion, I still don't think she's responsible. She's been on what the Americans know as government assistance in my country. She gets paid, and then within two days, it's all gone.", "Then NTA. You thinking she is still irresponsible is a valid reason to not give her a card, but something she did once as a teen is not. It's weird that you wrote about what she did as a kid and did not mention any of your current apprehensions."]}
