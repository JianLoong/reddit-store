My oldest sister and youngest brother was at school that day and we had a day off. We found a piece of paper with her handwriting with the details to the credit card. \n\nWhen I was 12-years-old my mother got her first ever credit card to try and rebuild her credit score as we grew up poor. My mother had a $200 maximum to spend on there and one day me and her were getting ready to go out food shopping. \n\nWe went to check out at our supermarket and the card was declining. Mum was embarrassed and had to leave everything behind. She got home and called up her credit card company to find out my sister had somehow spent $200 on the app store in a space of less than 20 minutes. \n\nIt was safe to say I was pissed of. I was my mother's carer as she was poorly for a while so I understood the importance of money and $200 was and still is a lot of money. \n\nThe thing is I have two sisters who are both older than me and a younger brother. My middle sister was the one who spent $200 on the app store. At the time my mother shouted at her once but didn't punish her which left me being angry as I had to try and find away to make money last and all I wanted to do was ground her buy my mother refused to allow it and let her do what she wanted. \n\nI still haven't forgiven her for it and I can't forget it; it's always on the back of my mind. Which brings us up to now. \n\nMy middle sister name was spelt wrong on her birth certificate which meant we couldn't set up a bank account for her. It took us a long time, many years, but we're finally getting it corrected. My sister was successful in getting her first ever job and hasn't got a bank account. She asked our oldest sister if she could use her card by my oldest sister only has one bank account and one card so she told my middle sister to ask me. I have two bank accounts so I could give her one card to use temporarily whilst she waits for her name to be corrected so she can apply to get ID and open a bank account but I just can't get over what happened ten years ago and said no. \n\nMy brother is on my side but my sisters are saying I'm being an asshole for not forgetting a thing that happened ten years ago and that I'm an idiot for not getting over it. \n\nSo Reddit, what do you think?

You for holding a kid\u2019s mistake over the head of an adult (not for not sharing your card, that\u2019s a personal decision); your mom is TA for not correcting the name issue when it first came up; and your sister is TA for assuming she can piggy-back on other people\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nIs there a reason she can\u2019t just transfer you guys the money and get cash from any of you instead?

By no means do you have to forgive her, thats a personal process, and you definitely don't have to let her use your bank account, but there was definitely a soft yta moment bringing that back up. She's had a lot of brain development time since then, and people dredging up actions from the distant past can be very embarrassing and hurtful. Nta for declining and not forgiving, but kind of yta for bringing up something from before her prefrontal cortex was developed as your reasoning.", "YTA for holding on to something that happened 10 years ago. You are harming yourself by continuing to obsess over this. 10 years is a long time to worry about someone inappropriately spending $200, especially given the fact it wasn't even your money.", "INFO How old was your sister when she did it? If she was like 14 and since then she never did anything similar then you would be AS for this.", "YTA for being so unreasonable and still holding onto this. People make mistakes. If she hasn't given you a reason to actually believe she'd still be irresponsible, you need to move on. Especially considering this wasn't even something that happened to you. You honestly sound like you're overstepping a lot. You're not the parent, OP. You don't get to ground your sister.", "YTA - imagine someone holding a grudge against you for years after something you did as a stupid teen.", "Around ten years since it happened.", "And how does she behave with money now? Did she ever do something this irresponsible again?", "NTA\n\nYour sisters name is spelt wrong on her birth cert. Is not an actual problem for a bank if your sister just signs her name as it's spelt on her birth cert. \n\nYou can also get that corrected by deed poll in *most* countries for a very cheap fee, from $10-$60 usually around 25-35 though. Then she has to request new IDs with her new name or if she already has them in that name, present them with the updated docs. Job done! \n\nBut NTA on not trusting her. I wouldn't.", "In my opinion, I still don't think she's responsible. She's been on what the Americans know as government assistance in my country. She gets paid, and then within two days, it's all gone.", "Then NTA. You thinking she is still irresponsible is a valid reason to not give her a card, but something she did once as a teen is not. It's weird that you wrote about what she did as a kid and did not mention any of your current apprehensions.", ">My middle sister name was spelt wrong on her birth certificate which meant we couldn't set up a bank account for her.\n\nYeah you could have. You set it up under the name on her birth certificate. \n\nTHEN you go through the process of getting it changed. In fact, your parents could have changed it while she was a child, much more easily than changing it as an adult. There's no good reason for her to have gotten to adulthood without having it corrected.\n\nPlus, if your sister was a minor when she charged things without permission on an app, those charges should have been disputed by your mother and they would have been reversed. So multiple people in this family are just not doing what they should.\n\nYou are NTA for not giving your card to your sister, but there's a lot of E.S.H. going on in your family.", "NTA if your oldest sister cares so much she can set up another account and card for the middle sister.", "Tell her to get a prepaid debit card.

And letting a person not on the account have access typically violates the terms, so it could fuck you over in case of fraud (perpetrated by someone else, not your sister) too.\n\nCould you make some other arrangements that do not involve giving her access to your account?  How do people without bank accounts get paid in your country?   Presumably, they must somehow as every country has unbanked people.  I would suggest looking into this.\n\nAnd what is the ETA on getting the birth certificate?  Could you look into getting the processing time sped up so she could get a bank account sooner?  Sometimes, there are options to do that in urgent cases.  There may be a fee for this, but perhaps you could loan (or gift if you wish) it to her if need be.\n\nEdit: also is there anything else the bank would accept to open the account?  Does she have ID with her correct name?  Would they have a document that she could swear or affirm (before the required official) as to her correct name and explain the discrepancy?  I know this can be done for some things, so it is worth asking.", "\"Spelled\"", "NTA. Kick me once, that's your fault, kick me twice and its mine.

I mean, I have a sister \"Marrisa\", and that's her name, because my dad spelled \"Marissa\" wrong on the birth certificate. \n\nThat said, NTA. Someone else can \"give\" her their account info.

Hundreds of thousands of people in the US don't have bank accounts and still manage to live their lives.", "NTA She can get a damn prepaid credit card from the store for the convenience, but access to another's money?

Yeah, it was 10 years ago, but that doesn't mean she has learned from that, especially as she experienced very little consequences for her actions.

If she hasn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure something she did years ago is the least of the reasons not to trust her.

Kids make mistakes like this, they spend money without realising it's value. My issue with your story is entirely about why your mother allowed you - even for a second - to feel like it was your responsibility to make money cover the grocery bill. That was her responsibility and if she wasn't up to the task it was her responsibility to ensure she had assistance from another adult - not her 12 yr old child.\n\nIf your mum wasn't even capable of managing her finances or ensuring there was another adult to assist with the financial management then it's hardly shocking that your sister doesn't have the required skills to manage money - it's a skill you learn, not something you are born with. \n\nYou aren't required to allow her to use your bank account.
