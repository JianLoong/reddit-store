I've been getting a lot of texts from my other siblings saying I'm in the wrong, so I'm posting here.\n\nI very recently got engaged and while my immediate family knows, extended  family doesn't and me and my fiance were going to announce it at  dinner. I asked step mom beforehand and she was completely fine with it.\n\nSo we make our engagement announcement and everyone seemed really happy  for us. Step mom then says '(Sister's name) would've been so excited'  and 'It would've been wonderful if they were here to see it'. Some other  relatives then started talking about them.\n\nI didn't say anything then but later told step mom I get she's hurt, I  really do, but she hurt me making my engagement about sister. Step mom  got upset saying it wasn't like that, but I told her what happened is  awful, but everything moves on and she needs to realize that.\n\nAs I mentioned a couple of my siblings have been saying what I overreacted  and was acting like a bitch towards step mom.

I bought her a porcelain Christmas tree that lit up. She would stare at it for hours with her eyes twinkling. I don't know what she was thinking. Was she envisioning being healthy & enjoying Christmas? She died 3 days afterwards.\n\n* **My mother loved Christmas & angels.** \n\nShe used to drag me out as a teenager, as she enjoyed going out to the mall to see the festive decorations. (*This was before malls cut back on holiday displays. They used to be so elaborate & colorful).* She hummed & then 'get' me grumpily to join along with the music in the stores & became silly with her. Our Christmas tree & the walls were decorated with angels. \n\n*My mother was such a prankster.* \n\nI tore through the entire house when she wasn't looking to figure out my gifts. She was on a limited disability. I didn't want her to feel bad, so would practice & prepare myself for her gifts. Uh, she wasn't the best in buying gifts (I'm 5'10\" and was over 150lbs. She'd buy underwear for petite too small to get a leg in, or bigger plus women too large the pants fell off) but loved her efforts. \n\nI decided to help her out by giving her a \"*list for Santa*\". It listed practical to the extravagant (as a joke). Listed my *current* shoe, underwear, sweater, jean & sock sizes along with wanting a trip to Greece & a purple Lamborghini (we both loved cars).\n\nThat year, *Santa* bought everything in the right sizes! I was amazed & grateful. Then she held off & gave me my last gift. I opened it up & it was a purple Lamborghini mini-scale mode in detail. ***She told me that I couldn't tell her that she didn't buy me a Lamborghini for Christmas!*** That's still with me from over 30 years ago. It's still one of my values possessions. She passed in 2006.\n\n* **An older quasi-mother friend I got hooked on Christmas**\n\nWe had an on/off again relationship as there were times, she annoyed the heck out of me putting demands of my time at the last minute (train story in another posting).\n\nShe helped me with the grieving process with my mother. Many experience depression during the holiday season. Cheering her up, I'd surprise & *kidnap* her driving many miles to various housing plans to see the elaborate decorated houses all along singing Christmas songs & our dreams for the upcoming year. When she saw the displays, she was in awe how they went to such great extent. We started doing a contest show rating the various houses & acting like a sports analyst what liked & didn't like. We had a ball. We did it for years until I moved away. She passed in 2018. Her daughters told me that was one of the big events she looked forward to, was getting kidnapped by me. At first, they really thought I was being violent & abusive until their mother explained it.\n\n* **Lastly, not a person**\n\nI was on assignment in San Diego. I had a cat but not all cats are lovey dovey, mine wasn't. I was down because it was Christmas time & felt lonely & sad. Saw an ad on the TV for the Pound dropping fees temporarily for this time of year. Figured wasn't going to get a dog but go pet & give some loving to a dog. Weekend comes, get dressed & go there.\n\nI saw a German Shepherd 6 months old puppy. I tried to go in a pen to pet it, but it was too interested in playing with a ball. I looked around & saw this dog sitting calmly in its cage next to a very aggressive dog that kept barking & lounging at the people. I asked if could see the calm dog (which was a corgi/lab). I sat in the visitor pen & this dog the minute he came into the pen, went straight up to me & put his head on my lap. Needless to say, he came home with me that very day. He was so loyal & loving to both me & my '*Garfield'* cat. They eventually became buddy-buddy.\n\nThe pound customer service kept mispronouncing the dog's name. When got home, I tried unsuccessfully to call for the dog to come to me. He didn't look at me or do anything. Dog was friendly but wasn't responding at all. So looked up his name. It's Malachi. Read the description, it's an angel. My mother reached out to me & gave me an angel. I got a chill realizing that.\n\nWhen Christmas comes, I am flooded with all the memories of the past including my mother, close friends & my dog. It keeps me company as I age. I admit recognized my grief will never subside other losing someone, it won't fade but become wonderful memories. A Christmas song, smell of cologne/perfume, a movie, or food even seeing decorated Christmas trees can trigger me back to a moment spent with them. Sometimes I have a good cry, tear up, or other times I'm laughing hilariously at our antics.\n\n ***Grief is not something one gets over.
