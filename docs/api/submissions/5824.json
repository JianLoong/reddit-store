This was a massive tragedy for me and my family when it happened, but we've managed to move on with  our lives. My dad and step mom (especially step mom) still bring them up  in conversation, talk about them all the time, etc. This year Christmas  dinner was at dad and step mom's, there were little name cards for  everyone and there were two for sister and her husband as well.\n\nI understand they're in a lot of grief, I am too but I know when to stop  and this seemed too much. I've been getting a lot of texts from my other siblings saying I'm in the wrong, so I'm posting here.\n\nI very recently got engaged and while my immediate family knows, extended  family doesn't and me and my fiance were going to announce it at  dinner. I asked step mom beforehand and she was completely fine with it.\n\nSo we make our engagement announcement and everyone seemed really happy  for us. Step mom then says '(Sister's name) would've been so excited'  and 'It would've been wonderful if they were here to see it'. Some other  relatives then started talking about them.\n\nI didn't say anything then but later told step mom I get she's hurt, I  really do, but she hurt me making my engagement about sister. Step mom  got upset saying it wasn't like that, but I told her what happened is  awful, but everything moves on and she needs to realize that.\n\nAs I mentioned a couple of my siblings have been saying what I overreacted  and was acting like a bitch towards step mom. I did text her an apology  today but she didn't reply. I talked to some friends about the  situation and they don't think I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672201523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx067k/aita_for_telling_my_step_mom_she_made_my/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She obviously loved your half sister very much, and she did not die that long ago. \n\nGrief is a hard weight to carry constantly, it stays in the back of your mind and makes you feel bad for being happy. I'm sure your step mother was happy for you, but she is still healing. Big life events, like your engagement, can remind others that the whole family isn't there to see it. \n\nI understand you may be able to hide how you feel around cetain people or at certain times, but you can't be mad at someone for not being able to do that so soon. She was not trying to ruin this moment for you.", "I think you need to realize that every important moment in life for your stepmother will be bittersweet.", "YTA. \n\nShe didn't make your engagement about your sister.

There is no pain like losing a child.   Unless it has happened to you, you will NEVER get it.

You picked a family moment to be about you.  You knew this included a remembrance of absent family members at a function hosted by your father and stepmother.  How could you be surprised your stepmom mentioned your absent family members, and how they would have felt about this announcement you made at a family moment in her house, not an engagement announcement party hosted by you. You made it worse by calling her out afterwards in her own house.  \nYou might\u2019ve had a leg to stand on if you had hosted Christmas or if you had a hosted an announcement party.

I think YTA a bit though.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for feeling as though your stepmom made the engagement about your deceased relatives.  This is valid.  I just think your decision to confront your stepmom, in any fashion, was poorly thought out.  She\u2019s grieving.  She\u2019s not looking for attention or going out of her way to overshadow you, she\u2019s just grieving.  I can understand it being annoying how things went, but this just wasn\u2019t an instance to set stepmom straight.", "I was N T A until I saw that it was the first Christmas after your half sister\u2019s passing, gonna go soft YTA.

You're stepmom is obviously still grieving and that might come out in some strange ways but I'm still glad you stood up for yourself and your special moment.\n\nHowever, I disagree with you telling her to move on.

You stepmom should have let you have your moment to yourself", "NTA. You had an important life announcement, and she absolutely made it about your sister. She can deny it all she wants, but bringing up someone who has passed is making the announcement about the dead. You even confronted her later and not in the moment, so I see no logical reason why your siblings are saying you overreacted. Your parents need therapy.", "you simply voiced your hurt feelings, I am assuming non-accusatory in manner, NTA.", "NTA.

I know I'd definitely struggle to raise the mood after someone mentions the recent death of a loved one, so I don't blame you for getting upset.

It's your first Christmas without your half sister so I reckon your step mum was feeling especially down.\n\nIf it had been a gathering you were throwing to tell everyone about your engagement or to celebrate it, or it had been a while since she'd died, I would have agreed with you, but not on the first christmas after her death", "Oh God, what do you want OP?

She has done things similar to the place cards your step mom did such as made an Xmas list of things he \u201cwould have wanted\u201d and for her birthday got a cake he liked best, not her. Specifically, my wedding was one of the last big events he attended before he died suddenly just a few months later. Once when speaking about my wedding my mother said \u201cI think the best part about your wedding was what fun your brother had\u201d. The best part about *my* wedding was the fun a guest had? Lol I was angry at first and held it in, but the way I see it now is she has a grief that I can\u2019t even imagine. It probably makes people say and do dumb things, but I wouldn\u2019t wish her pain on anyone and I certainly do not want to make her feel bad or awkward for how she expresses it. Even if it upsets me when she finds a way to bring him up in *any* conversation no matter how unrelated, I just stay quiet.

It looks very hardcore to put name tags and if it has been a long time it's way too excessive.
