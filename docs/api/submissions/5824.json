I've been getting a lot of texts from my other siblings saying I'm in the wrong, so I'm posting here.\n\nI very recently got engaged and while my immediate family knows, extended  family doesn't and me and my fiance were going to announce it at  dinner. I asked step mom beforehand and she was completely fine with it.\n\nSo we make our engagement announcement and everyone seemed really happy  for us. Step mom then says '(Sister's name) would've been so excited'  and 'It would've been wonderful if they were here to see it'. Some other  relatives then started talking about them.\n\nI didn't say anything then but later told step mom I get she's hurt, I  really do, but she hurt me making my engagement about sister. Step mom  got upset saying it wasn't like that, but I told her what happened is  awful, but everything moves on and she needs to realize that.\n\nAs I mentioned a couple of my siblings have been saying what I overreacted  and was acting like a bitch towards step mom.

I imagine your stepmother was telling you your stepsister would have been so happy because it\u2019s true but also because she misses her daughter terribly.\n\nDon\u2019t be the jerk that gets jealous of a dead person. It\u2019s never a good look.", "YTA", "YTA, this wasn't your engagement party it was a family Christmas ofc they are going to remember your sister ans what she said was loving", "Wait it's the first Christmas without your step sister and her husband and your step mother is still understandably dealing with the loss of her daughter, yet you think because you've \"Moved on\" everyone should?? You acted very disrespectful by disregarding what you said to your Step mother and the fact you texted an apology and didn't try to even apologize in person shows how much you truly cared about your step sister.  \n\n\nIf you know everyone deals with grief differently then you should know that sudden loss of your step sister is still greatly affecting your step mother, if she can move on it'll take years. But with a loss like it's not like removing a bandaid. \n\nYTA", "YTA, never lost one of my children but you would have to almost put me in the box with them. That's her baby, she taught her literally how to be a human.  She watched every victory and every heart break. She  hugged until it got better but this time a hug can't make it better. She won't ever see relief again.  Expecting her to be over that in a year is absolutely impossible. \n\nShe isn't less happy for you. You made your announcement and I'm sure there were squeals of joy. This engagement is a journey that will provide you with many moments of happiness. I'm sure she is truly happy for you and she knows your sister would have been too but for her honestly she knows deep down that is another smile she missed seeing and its ok for her to have both of those emotions at the same time.", "YTA, your stepmother lost her daughter less than a year ago, and you are already sulking that she's grieving too long? This is her first Christmas since her daughter died, and she was gracious enough to let you make a big announcement but that still wasn't enough for you. Your siblings must also be grieving too, so your entitlement is really disrespectful. Let people grieve. Just because you stopped grieving immediately, please give everyone else all the time they need.", "Wow, YTA. \n\nFrom your post she didn't make it about your (recently deceased!) half sister at all, she just mentioned how happy your (recently deceased!!) half sister would have been for you. Try and think about how hard this must be for your step mum, seeing you about to get married probably has brought up all sorts of sad memories of your half sisters wedding and the reminder that she won't get to see your half sister reach any more of these life milestones.\n\nYou don't get to put a timetable on her grief.", "YTA. It was the first Christmas without your sister. A quick \u201cI wish she had been here to congratulate you, I know she\u2019d be thrilled\u201d isn\u2019t out of line. And not that it should truly matter but this wasn\u2019t an engagement party. It wasn\u2019t even supposed to be about you. It was just one more update shared on a holiday. Others may have mentioned a new job, house, dog etc. No one made your engagement about your sister but you. It\u2019s ok for others to be spoken about, particularly in the context of a family member who passed away and it\u2019s the first Christmas without them and approaching the anniversary of their passing. \n\nI\u2019m sad for your stepmom and father you didn\u2019t have compassion for what a mixed bag of emotions that first Christmas would bring for them. It had nothing to do with you, it was always going to be mentioned that your sister wasn\u2019t there. She was always going to be spoken about or remembered by those who loved and missed her.", "So she's been gone for less than a year? How does OP think she's not the AH?", "Omg that makes it so much worse! 'Quit the grieving, you've had *months* so move on!'  Yikes!!", "Also, read OP\u2019s comments.  The sister only passed away in January of this year.  It\u2019s literally been less than a year and the first Christmas without her.", "Exactly this. Perfect answer.", "Husband last November and sister this January.  It's not even a year.", "Stepmother lost her daughter in January this year, and the entire family (except OP of course) would have seen this first Christmas without her as a huge painful milestone. Yes, obviously it was special and added a bright note to the day that OP announced her engagement, but the family are also allowed to see Christmas as a time for grieving for someone who only died recently.  Yet OP was offended that her stepsister's name was even mentioned. \n\nParents are allowed to grieve for their children without being called \"Debby Downer\" for  mentioning their name, or for saying something like \"she would be so happy for you.\" If OP is going to be so irritated by the family's grief maybe she should skip family events, because next Christmas will be tough too -  you don't tell a grieving parent to just \"move on\" especially after less than a year.", "She made first Christmas after sister dying about herself (died January).\n\nParents only buried their son in law last month!", "What kind of \"vibe\" was OP expecting at the family's first Christmas after her stepsister died? The parents and siblings are grieving for their daughter/ sister who died in January. The first Christmas after a family member dies is just a milestone that everyone tries to get through, especially if it's a tragic death, and something like a happy announcement can really help everyone. But OP can't lecture a grieving mother about moving on because the day wasn't completely about her.", "*No one appreciates everything being turned into a wake.*\n\nIt's the first Christmas after the sister died, and it's a family event for the parents and siblings, so of course they are going to grieve together for their daughter/ sister. \n\nIf OP is so annoyed that her siblings and parents haven't \"moved on\" after 11 months she should have gone to her fiance's family for Christmas.", "because she's decided she's the main character", "No she purposely left out how long ago it was.\n\nEdit: It was January. Not even a year.", "I\u2019m sorry, what?!?!  It\u2019s the first Christmas since they passed away and you\u2019re angry that they\u2019re still grieving???\n\nYTA. Totally and completely.", "All events the first year after the passing of a loved one suck majorly. Suck. Majorly. And a daughter? Can\u2019t even imagine. I\u2019d love to have said you were not overreacting. But you really were/are insensitive to your step-moms grieving process. \n\nAs others have said, it sounded from your description that the deaths were several years back. I\u2019d suggest you read up on grieving and try to empathise a bit with your step-mom and dad. \n\nUnfortunately YTA.", "OMG. You made it seem like they passed a while ago. \n\nNO SHIT they still bring THEIR DAUGHTER up all the time and talk about her all the time. It\u2019s been less than a year since she died, they\u2019re still heavily grieving. \n\nIt was the first Christmas since they lost their daughter and son-in-law, you should\u2019ve understood that there would be a lot of remembrance that day and should\u2019ve never tried to make it about your engagement in the first place.", "I hate when people want to hurry someone else's grieving process. Also does she want to wipe their memories out? Does she want to never mention their existence? They did have a life and they did have people who loved them, talking about them helps the healing process. \n\nOP YTA", "I think it's fine to make those announcements, just wrong to expect the whole day/gathering to be about the announcement.", "Couple of friends of mine used my 40th to quietly let mutual friends know they were pregnant as it was the opportunity to let a third of their social circle know in one go. They were so discreet about it that for a few weeks a dozen of us thought we were the only ones that knew \ud83e\udd23. I always think about them when posts of ppl hijacking other events to celebrate themselves come up \ud83d\ude0a", "While I understand the first holidays without loved ones are hard, it is kinda tactless to bring up how dead people would react when someone brings up good news. It can do nothing but bring the mood down. \n\n>She made Christmas about herself\n\nNo. Christmas is a time of joy and sharing major life events is supposed to be a celebration.", "It's been less than a year since your sister died. Clearly that doesn't seem to mean anything to you - I mean \"they're in grief\" but you're not? \n\nThis is the **first Christmas since your sister died**. Name cards/candles/empty chairs are all traditions to help people grieve and cope with the loss and move on. \n\nYour step-mothers comment was also quite innocuous really - saying that your sister would have been excited, is a way to be wistful and validate your engagement at the same time. At my grad my mother said pretty much the same phrase about my grandmother - but it did not mean that she'd made the whole thing about my grandmother.\n\nEither you are in grief and in denial, so don't want to have any reminders of what happened - or you are unemotional, cold, and callous. In either case perhaps you need therapy just as much as your step mother might.", "This wasn\u2019t an engagement party. \nThis wasn\u2019t an event you were hosting. \n\nYou announced your engagement, albeit with permission, at a family gathering at Christmas during dinner, the first Christmas since they lost her, and expected that to become the main event/celebration.", "It's not just your stepmother who is grieving but also your siblings. Did you tell them off for mentioning your half-sister's name too? \n\nYour stepmother's comment was lovely and appropriate, you were callous and completely self-centred. This was a tough day for your stepmother, and she was facing it bravely. Your announcement could have been a bright note to help everyone through the day, but you spoilt it by complaining that your dead half-sister was mentioned. \n\nMaybe now that you are engaged, you can start spending Christmas with your fiance's family and let your parents and siblings grieve in peace without your nasty commentary about how they are doing life wrong.", "I\u2019d say that\u2019s the way OP sees it.", "Agreed.  I work a lot with grief in my job and I feel very strongly that there is no time limit on missing someone and saying that they would have enjoyed something or would have been happy about something.  People like to say \u201cOh, it\u2019s (insert timeframe) later, you should be over it!\u201d \n\nWe are supposed to remember our loved ones and the way the stepmom approached it doesn\u2019t read like she made it all about the sister. She just misses her daughter!", "This year Christmas dinner was at dad and step mom's, there were little name cards for everyone and there were two for sister and her husband as well.\n\nI doubled check - it was a Christmas dinner where she decided to ask her parents permission to make her announcement", "This is a family event for the parents and siblings of a young woman who died less than a year ago. They were happy for OP about the engagement, but none of them appreciated that she accosted a grieving mother and told her to \"move on\" just because stepmother mentioned the daughter who only just died.\n\nAs a family event for a grieving family, they are entitled to grieve together without being sneered at by OP who clearly wanted the day to be about her engagement.", "Wait, I thought Christmas was about family. You think death of a child isn\u2019t a major life of event? \n\nThe first Christmas since they died!? Come on.", "Imagine the attention she will demand the first Christmas after her divorce.", "Accosted a grieving mother? She said something to her later, she didn't turn into an animal frothing at the mouth after step mom put a big downer on her news.
