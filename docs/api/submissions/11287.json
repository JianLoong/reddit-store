{"id": 11287, "submission_id": "11g0zyc", "title": "AITA for showing my boobs to a little boy?", "selftext": " Hey guys,\n\nFor the last few years I (36f) have been taking dance classes at the local community center. I go there after work, usually arrive about 15 minutes before the class starts and change there. It\u2019s a small center so there is only two changing rooms : one for men and one for women. As there are lots of different types of classes at the center, the changing rooms are usually full of people dressing and undressing. The classes I\u2019m taking are belly dance classes. The clothes we wear are not your typical gym clothes, but more suitable for this kind of dance (skirts, crop tops, shiny scarfs around the hips). But it\u2019s still a sport so I wear a sports bra.  \n \n\nYesterday I arrived a little bit earlier than most times and found the changing room empty. When I was putting on my sports bra, the straps got tangled in my hair and I was struggling to put it on correctly. And just as I was panicking, I heard a voice yell \u201cboobies!\u201d. I turned around and saw this little boy, about 5, staring. I quickly covered my chest with the first thing I could find and it just happened to be a belly dance scarf (one of those with coins and sparkly things attached to it). Then I just stepped aside and managed to put on the damn sports bra. I was about to forget this whole thing, when a woman, about my age appeared next to me and started scolding me. At first I didn\u2019t understand what she was saying, but then I heard : \u201cWhy are you exposing yourself to my boy!\u201d. And once again, I panicked as I thought I was in the men\u2019s room. But I looked around and there were other women there. In fact, the little boy was the only non-female in the room.  \n \n\nI learned later on that a new class was taking place at the center. Something like \u201cMommy and me dance lessons\u201d. So there were children with their mothers. \n\nI politely explained to the mother that this was the women locker room, and I was just changing. Not deliberately exposing my boobs to small children. But she heard none of it and yelled at me for not being immoral, that the boy is going to be traumatized, that I have to go change in the bathroom and all kind of crazy sh\\*t like that. I tried ignoring her, put on the rest of my clothes and tried escaping. But then she took issue with my dance clothes and called me a few choice words, not suitable for children\u2019s ears.\n\nI told her again that this was the girls room and she has to expect to see boobs there. That if that was a problem, she should go somewhere else. Then I finally managed to escape.\n\nWhen my class started, I talked to a few of the women taking the class and told them what happened. I expected sympathy, but they told me that when they saw the children at the locker room, they went to change in the bathroom. And that since I don\u2019t have kids, I don\u2019t understand that what I did was bad.  \n   \n \n\nAnd now I don\u2019t know. Was I wrong? Like seriously, am I supposed to go change in the bathroom from now on? AITA?

I noticed that my son didn't usually start crying when he fell down or something until I gasped and ran over to him. So I started waiting. If he fell, I would wait for his response before deciding how I would react. Most of the time he would look at me, see I wasn't freaking out, and then move on with his activities.\n\nThe way this mom reacted likely upset her kid.

Children have no boundaries. It's pretty inevitable. I made it a point to not make a big thing of it when it happened.

I believe 99% of parents try to match their child to their parent for changing, but sometimes it's not always possible, and there aren't always \"family\" spaces available. It's similar to me bringing my son into the ladies room at Walmart to pee because he's not old enough to go into his own bathroom - I'm not making an announcement that I'm bringing my son into the women's bathroom.", "That basically *is* the expectation when women bring their sons to the mens locker room though (or when men being their daughters). So this isn't really a \"flip the genders\" scenario because that already happens way more often the other way around.", " I don't blame you for not believing me. I am kind of relieved that it has happened to someone else. I wish it was not true as I'm still a little angry from the exchange and don't know how I will react next week when I go back", "Thank you! So many AITA posters believe every wacky story posted here is real.", "No, no she could not. The child goes with the parent, not the other way around. A grown woman has absolutely no place in the mens locker room, just like I'm sure women wouldn't be overly thrilled if a man took his daughters to the womens locker room.", "Ew, we're talking about a 5 year old.", "Some countries are much more prudish than yours.", "Little predator, really?

I would have apologized to OP and scolded the kid because commenting on people's bodies is so rude, but you can probably bet someone's husband is exclaiming BOOBIES every time that mom is topless and he's got his kid following that path too. \n\nMy husband messed up with our daughter when she was a similar age because he used to say, \"I heard that!\" when she farted. You know she did that to him once or thrice in public before he could convince her to stop. Can't toot and scoot in a store when your kid is diming you out.", "Really? Thats what you took from my comment? It was an \"unfortunate accident\" because she wasn't intending to show anyone her breast but got caught up in her bra which correct me if I'm wrong would be classed as an unfortunate accident.", "Then UK or Ireland. I had to wear a bikini in an irish sauna, so wouldn't be surprising...", "Yes, this does indeed happen. My ex had a similar experience except the kid was being a pervert and staring.", "Yeah, so? Don't know if you've ever been a 5 year old boy but they tend to like boobies. Most guys I know can tell you right now the first time they saw a naked lady. Doubt when the kid said \"boobies!\" He was saying it in a horrified way. Should I have said \"clutch the pearls! the poor baaaaby\"", "He didn\u2019t but he needs to be taught not to - as does the mother in question. \n\nThey\u2019re boobs. Everybody has them in some form.", "Oh, you're not understanding. He'll survive. There's nothing wrong or shameful about the human body, and honestly, as a mom to a 6 year old, I sincerely doubt he'll even remember this.

He didn't do anything to suggest that he doesn't know not to sexualize boobs. \n\nHe reacts to seeing boobs the same way my little cousin (4) reacts when she sees a completely bald man.", "Then please accept my apology as I misunderstood you. But honestly, kids remember more than some folks give them credit for. As I said almost any guy I know can tell you the first time they saw a naked lady, I have no stats or hard evidence but If I were in Las Vegas betting on whether he's remember that day, I'd bet that he would, that's all. And I'm not saying 5 year olds bragging about boobs is cool or anything. But it is what it is and it does happen.", "It's something different and taboo which is interesting to children. You're making it gross by thinking the popularity comes from 5 year olds would find it sexually interesting rather than the novelty of seeing something adults don't want you to. Scary movies, a dead body, blood, anything that makes the grown ups freak out that you saw is worthy of a playground story and the other kids would be interested due to the taboo/restricted nature of it.\n\nAdults do the same thing. You'll get attention at the watercolor for seeing something out of the ordinary.", "My point is - the mom is. Her son is 5. He\u2019s old enough to know you don\u2019t shout \u201cboobies\u201d and point. He\u2019s old enough to pick up on shaming other people and that they should hide their body. That\u2019s not okay. She\u2019s sexualising a woman changing her clothes, teaching that to her son.  What\u2019s next? \u201cOh god, put your breasts away, you can\u2019t feed a baby like that!\u201d??\n\nMy oldest is 4. She knows we don\u2019t point at people\u2019s bodies. That bodies are bodies. That bodies are different and come in different shapes, sizes, and colours. Etc.", "Ah, maybe I'm just holding on to the hope that my son and his friends can stay innocent for a while longer and still see boobs as just as part of the body, not a braggable sight. \n\nAt least we can agree op did nothing wrong, and the kid will not be horrifically stunted from seeing a pair of tits in the locker room \ud83d\ude02", "I agree that he shouldn't have pointed or shouted, but it's pretty weird to jump straight to sexualization when that wasn't even a factor as it seems.", "But that is precisely what his mother is doing by making it a big deal.", "Yes, I'm not arguing that. But by saying that *he* needs to learn, you're implying that he doesn't already know or that he's showing some indication that he *is* sexualizing breast.", "NTA it's a locker room.... you could have been fully nude and still could not be the asshole in this situation.  She brought her boy into that space. She exposed your breasts to her son, not you.", "Nta, the child who said that should receive a stern talking to for sexualizing you.", "NTA.  If that kid\u2019s mom thinks him seeing one pair of boobs was traumatizing, I have bad news for her. \n\n(Five seems a little old to be yelling about body parts?)", "NTA. You were changing in the womens' change room. WTF? If the mom does not want her son to see womens' skin, SHE should change in the bathroom.", "NTA it\u2019s literally called a CHANGING room", "Lol what? NTA. Of course there\u2019s boobies in the women\u2019s changing room and kids do not think of them as sexual or traumatizing WTF. If the kid was any younger he\u2019d probably get hungry for milk lol.", "Nta - and clearly the kid has seen boobs before because he called them out. It\u2019s fine others changes elsewhere when seeing a child there but you were there first.", "NTA He's too young to be left alone so mom has to take him with her into the locker room, but you have the right to change in the locker room. It's not ideal, but what can you do?  Mom should expect to see women changing, that's a normal thing women do there. You didn't even know they would be there. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. If you were in the men's changing room you would be but you were in the ladies!! Honestly as a woman I'd be more inclined to complain that she had brought a boy in to see MY body.", "NTA I have two kids and one is a boy. Boobs are boobs the only people sexualizing them are those ignorant mothers. A 5yr old won\u2019t die because they saw some random boobs. What is wrong with people? You were in the women\u2019s locker room getting changed not running through a school flashing kids.", "NTA, fuck her. You did nothing wrong! She is the bad parent here.", "NTA, he already knew what they were. Sounds less like exposure, sounds more like immersion therapy stage.", "NTA.

When they were little and I would take them swimming in the winter, they both came into the women's change room with me. There were all kinds of naked bodies in there - women and little kids m & f - and no one cared!!\n\nNTA\n\nETA - I'm sorry, but the picture of you getting tangled up in your sports bra had me laughing. I've done that a few times too lol", "I have 2 kids and so being a parent or not is irrelevant in this debate.

If all of the women change in the bathrooms, anyone who has to pee has to do it on the floor. The women's locker room IS, in fact, the changing room. You can turn your back to little kids who are in there, but you don't have to tie up a bathroom to make them comfortable.
