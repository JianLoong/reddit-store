{"id": 11287, "submission_id": "11g0zyc", "title": "AITA for showing my boobs to a little boy?", "selftext": " Hey guys,\n\nFor the last few years I (36f) have been taking dance classes at the local community center. I go there after work, usually arrive about 15 minutes before the class starts and change there. It\u2019s a small center so there is only two changing rooms : one for men and one for women. As there are lots of different types of classes at the center, the changing rooms are usually full of people dressing and undressing. The classes I\u2019m taking are belly dance classes. The clothes we wear are not your typical gym clothes, but more suitable for this kind of dance (skirts, crop tops, shiny scarfs around the hips). But it\u2019s still a sport so I wear a sports bra.  \n \n\nYesterday I arrived a little bit earlier than most times and found the changing room empty. When I was putting on my sports bra, the straps got tangled in my hair and I was struggling to put it on correctly. And just as I was panicking, I heard a voice yell \u201cboobies!\u201d. I turned around and saw this little boy, about 5, staring. I quickly covered my chest with the first thing I could find and it just happened to be a belly dance scarf (one of those with coins and sparkly things attached to it). Then I just stepped aside and managed to put on the damn sports bra. I was about to forget this whole thing, when a woman, about my age appeared next to me and started scolding me. At first I didn\u2019t understand what she was saying, but then I heard : \u201cWhy are you exposing yourself to my boy!\u201d. And once again, I panicked as I thought I was in the men\u2019s room. But I looked around and there were other women there. In fact, the little boy was the only non-female in the room.  \n \n\nI learned later on that a new class was taking place at the center. Something like \u201cMommy and me dance lessons\u201d. So there were children with their mothers. \n\nI politely explained to the mother that this was the women locker room, and I was just changing. Not deliberately exposing my boobs to small children. But she heard none of it and yelled at me for not being immoral, that the boy is going to be traumatized, that I have to go change in the bathroom and all kind of crazy sh\\*t like that. I tried ignoring her, put on the rest of my clothes and tried escaping. But then she took issue with my dance clothes and called me a few choice words, not suitable for children\u2019s ears.\n\nI told her again that this was the girls room and she has to expect to see boobs there. That if that was a problem, she should go somewhere else. Then I finally managed to escape.\n\nWhen my class started, I talked to a few of the women taking the class and told them what happened. I expected sympathy, but they told me that when they saw the children at the locker room, they went to change in the bathroom. And that since I don\u2019t have kids, I don\u2019t understand that what I did was bad.  \n   \n \n\nAnd now I don\u2019t know. Was I wrong? Like seriously, am I supposed to go change in the bathroom from now on? AITA?

I noticed that my son didn't usually start crying when he fell down or something until I gasped and ran over to him. So I started waiting. If he fell, I would wait for his response before deciding how I would react. Most of the time he would look at me, see I wasn't freaking out, and then move on with his activities.\n\nThe way this mom reacted likely upset her kid.

I had an ex with a son a month older than my daughter (they were 5 at the time, summer before kindy) and his mother called my ex after a visit and said he was \"no longer allowed to visit my place\" (ex lived with me in my place where I'd dedicated my third bedroom to his son instead of gaming and craft room like I'd planned when signing a lease for a 3bedroom.) Why?? Because he'd walked in on me while I was showering and went home and told his mom he saw my boobies. Meanwhile my now 3weeks short of 10 year old knows everything there is to know about reproduction and human biology because bodies aren't shameful and science is WONDERFUL. She knows men and women are different, that bodies NATURALLY GROW HAIR GASP! And even that *whispers* a male and female use reproduction functions to MAKE A BABY! She's fascinated by snake morphs and knows that they make babies similarly but different from us, and she knows the American version of \"mate\" as in sexual mate or mating. We don't need to hide life from children, she knows she knows far more than most 9/10yos and she knows it's not school yard talk because \"some parents aren't comfortable with their young children understanding these things at her age\" but I'm not comfortable with hiding natural things from mine, myself. \n\nOp if that mom or others start making frequent appearances (aka throwing tantrums at you) talk with gym management about how much you appreciate their facilities but if you are no longer allowed to use the CHANGING ROOM to CHANGE you will need to discuss what they will be taking from your billing for the breach of contract. In the contracts they make you sign I almost guarantee somewhere in it it will state \"paying for use of facilities\" and if you can't use the facilities you're paying for you should not be having to pay full costs of facilities. \"Is there a spare room that could be used for a family changing room for this mother as I do not think it's my responsibility to not use the facilities I've paid for due to another member verbally assaulting me for doing so in the location that has been historically the place to do so\" type of conversation could work too. Point being, don't bring it up to other members until you've brought it up to the company. It's ultimately their responsibility to handle their members and set realistic expectations for all parties. \n\n...if there is no assistance by management and you can only go here for classes I personally wouldn't be completely above making a \"BOOBIES AHEAD!

I'm not comfortable with anyone seeing my naked body or seeing other people's naked bodies, I just don't get them at all.", "NTA idk how it is in most places, but when I used to go to the Y, there were signs outside the locker rooms stating that children over 4 years had to either be taken to the family changing room, or use their appropriate locker room, because people kept bringing their boys into the women's room and they, naturally being curious children, would just stare at all the boobies and it made everyone uncomfortable. They also had signs in the toilet stalls explicitly stating NOT to change in them because that's not what they're for. \n\nIf you go into the women's changing room, you're going to see boobs. Either don't take your son in there, or use it as an opportunity to normalize human bodies and teach him to be respectful, instead of sexualizing and shaming people who are minding their own business and using the space as intended. It's not unlikely you'll encounter this woman again, if I were you, I would talk to the gym staff about it.\n\nAlso, just an afterthought- who in the hell is traumatized by boobs?? \ud83d\ude02 gimme a break", "NTA and I'm baffled by everyone's reaction in this story. It's a changing room lol of course you're going to find naked people? I am a parent and it wouldn't have even occurred to me that this would be an issue.\n\nI guess society is the asshole for making bodies shameful and nudity sexual when they're not.", "NTA! I have 3 boys ranging from aged 7 to 1. Breasts are normal! My 7yo asked me the other day why girls have different bathing suits. I genuinely fumbled through an answer stating western culture (we live in Canada) generally do not like to see women\u2019s breasts exposed and I guess it just applies to girls as well. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. That class sounds fun.", "I\u2019m an overly modest person (thank you, purity culture for the PTSD) and even I think this is silly.\n\nYou went into a then empty women\u2019s changing room and changed (literal purpose of a changing room). A small child came in before you were covered.\n\nIf that mom doesn\u2019t want her son to see undressed women and girls, she either needs to bring him to class in his workout clothes or decide he\u2019s big enough to use the men\u2019s changing room.\n\nYou didn\u2019t traumatize her son, but she will by objectifying women in front of him.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. You were doing what you were supposed to be doing, in the room you were supposed to be doing it in. I am shocked that the other women in your class didn't back you up. It is not your fault the Propriety Police took her small son into the wrong room. \n\nAs for her filthy critique of your costume.... I myself did bellydance for several years, and I got so tired of people acting like I was studying How to Be a Prostitute 101. The costumes are not any more revealing than gear women wear to the gym.", "Boobs aren't genitals. Let those babies free!", "NTA. You were in a changing room, you have a right to get changed. Some gyms, swimming pools and similar facilities I've been to actually have a rule that you can't bring opposite-sex children into the locker room past a certain age (usually 3 or 4, I think). \n\nIf this woman doesn't want her 5 year old seeing boobies, then she should not bring him to place where he is almost certain to see them.", "You could have been bent over buck naked and would still be NTA. Changing rooms have nudity. It\u2019s an expected sight going in, if you don\u2019t like that it\u2019s up to the person offended to go change in a bathroom, stall, or have their gym clothes on upon entering the gym. Bodies are nothing to be ashamed of especially in a space where being nude for brief periods of time is expected and as long as you weren\u2019t doing a sexually explicit actions or in someones personal bubble you\u2019re all good.", "NTA. You were there changing before the child came in. How were you supposed to know children would come in?! Speak to a manager. You shouldn't have to change in a bathroom next to a public toilet.", "NTA\n\nPlease speak to the owners of the studio. Nothing about her behavior is okay. She brought a MALE child in with her and failed to watch him, allowing him to actively violate the privacy of another paying customer and blaming said customer for changing IN A LOCKER ROOM while she let her child wander and failed to discipline him for making inappropriate comments.", "NTA the disabled stall in the bathroom is not a changing room. When the other ladies said they changed in the bathroom it probably means they used the largest stall available which is the disabled toilet. I'm a wheelchair user and that is the only stall I can use. It pisses me off to wait to take a pee while someone is change clothes especially when a changing room is available. You are NOT the Asshole for using the female changing room to change clothes. Everyone who uses the bathroom stalls especially the disabled stall to change clothes are assholes. Also the mother is an asshole if she doesn't want her kid to see boobs don't take him into a female changing room. That is just common sense.", "Haha I have a kid. Please change in front of her when she's in the women's locker room. I want her to see real women's bodies.\n\nNta, I assume you know that. Those people sound pretty crazy...", "NTA \n\nIt's a changing room, that's what it's for. Seeing boobs in a changing room isn't going to traumatize a child. Especially one young enough to still need adult assistance in a changing room.", "NTA - I wouldn't bring my young child into a changing room and yell at people for changing. That's ridiculous In fact, now that my son is 5, we try to keep him out of the woman's restrooms and locker rooms in any place that's not family friendly (not for his sake, he doesn't care, we don't care - I just know some women might be uncomfortable).\n\nNo child will be traumatized by boobs. They might find them funny, but they definitely won't be traumatized.", "NTA!  That mom needs to stop clutching her pearls.  They are just boobs!", "I say this as a woman from a very modest evangelical Christian subculture; I don't go out in public showing my knees or shoulders or anything in between and I am also a mother of nine children:\n\nYou are NTA.\n\n1. Boobs aren't traumatizing viewing for a child. Boobs are how we fed babies. Her behavior normalizes the sexualization of them, and that is going to screw up her son more than boob-spotting at a young age.\n\n2. It's a women's locker room. If she didn't want her child to see women's bodies, SHE should have been the one to seek other accommodations, not demand that others accommodate her.\n\n3. Rudeness and name calling of a complete stranger model behavior for her child that is way more concerning than a brief boob flash.\n\nI'm very sorry that she treated you that way and even more sorry that other women didn't have your back. It's not because you aren't mom: giving birth doesn't give us some magical secret knowledge of what's appropriate for children; brains and experience do. You clearly have those already.", "YTA, have some decency.", "Seriously. \u201cHow dare you as a woman get undressed and change in a woman\u2019s changing room?!?\u201d \n\nMa\u2019am. \n\nNTA", "If this boy remembers it, he\u2019s likely to remember how his mom made him feel about the situation rather than what he saw.. that\u2019s the actual trauma - seeing his mom react inappropriately and likely cuss/shame another woman & not having a safe place for the feelings that brought up", "I've also always thought parents making such a huge deal and fuss in front of an innocent little kid does more to give the kid the idea that bodies are shameful or maybe even exciting and forbidden and something to indulge in when they're not looking. Seriously, if you acted unimpressed by it, the kid would probably ignore it and think nothing of it, but all you're doing is drawing attention to it!", "Yeah OP definitely went for the shock value title didn't they?", "How did all the small children survive being in group showers of the opposite gender with their parents after swimming. Miracles! /s", "I kinda agree, but I also like that she's not setting the reader up to automatically respond \"NTA\" before understanding the situation.", "You say that, but this took place in Europe.", "op doesn't live in america:)", "That's what I was thinking?\n\nI have two boys, age 3 and age 6 months. Sometimes my infant will cry and my 3-year-old son will bring the breast pump over and say, \"Mommy, Theo is hungry!\" because he knows the breast pump is one way to get milk and he doesn't want his brother to be hungry. Lol I don't think it's traumatizing; he just sees breasts as a normal body part that I use to feed his baby brother.", "Ew can you stop sexualizing breasts?", "That is so adorable.  I was a total daddy\u2019s girl and apparently when I was really little I used to follow him into the bathroom and sit on the edge of the tub and talk to him while he was in there.  I have no memory of this, but since he said it in a happy, reminiscent voice, I\u2019m hoping it was cute and not annoying.  \ud83d\ude06", "Agreed! It\u2019s by far time for people to stop sexualizing nudity. \nNTA", ">I would have run my fat arse to the gym office asking why the hell was a male child allowed, unsupervised, in the women changing room\n\nThis is what I would have done--turn it back on the mother. If she wants to instill her children with shame for their bodies, be my guest, but not at my expense. I don't pay X amount each month to get heckled by a child with lazy parents.", "Could you imagine if a father brought his little daughter into the men's locker room and let her wonder around unattended.  But a mother is allowed to do it with her son?  A locker room is a changing room.  No one should have to go into a toilet stall to change because a little kid is running around.  That's like a having a bathroom with no doors and someone getting pissed that your child walked in and saw you pissing.  Are you then expected to squeeze into a locker to change or pee?", "My thoughts exactly.", "Yup, I'm so happy that I'm European and we don't experience the same level of puritanism that is in the US. I went swimming a lot when I was a child and I saw plenty of naked people in the changing rooms. Nothing weird about it.", "Exactly! There is huge difference between seeing body parts in a safe setting and being sexualized. Kids should also know by that age that any time anyone tells them not to tell their parents about something that person is lying to them and they should immediately tell someone who keeps them safe. Also, the names of body parts or at least names that are common usage. Most children do see adults in various states of undress because there isn't any other option. You can't let a five year old into a public changing space without supervision just like you can't hold your bladder for hours on end if your baby is awake. You can't leave the baby alone. Why do people think kids have to learn when they are older that they can't always be in the bathroom with their parents? The mother was way out of line. NTA.", "The bathroom was empty. She literally said that.", "Absolutely! We don't comment on people's bodies and especially not in private places like bathrooms or locker rooms! The lack of shame is so pathetic from the mom. If you can't trust your kids to behave like dignified, respectful people, you messed up, not the other person.", "My experience is that girls are always welcome in the women\u2019s locker room and bathroom regardless of who is accompanying them. My father definitely brought us to the women\u2019s room a couple times until we were old enough to go in alone.", "I know. Apparently he's seen them before or he wouldn't have correctly identified them!", "Would the mother have freaked out if this lady was in the locker room breastfeeding her baby?  Men and society at large have sexualized female breasts, but that is what their function is really for.  It is for nourishment of their child.  If this woman doesn't want her son to see breasts, then don't go into a woman's locker room, aka a changing room.", "Or bottle fed him the entire time.", "I haven't been in a gym in 12 years, but we were specifically not allowed to change clothes in the bathroom stalls. NTA", "That's still not enough, some creeps just get off to exposing themselves to kids. (Which isn't okay)", "Sounds lovely and practical.", "When my boys were about 3 yrs we got them a book to help answer their questions. 'Amazing you - Getting smart about your private parts'. For a while it was their favourite book and they were completely fascinated by how they'll change as they get older. They're 5 & 8 now and looking forward to being 'hairy like daddy'.", "The bottle is shaped like a *nipple*!!!", "As s swede I think that mum would have a heart attack in one of our gyms or public pools/public bath house. If it's separate genders in the looker room, shower and sauna, expect everyone to be nude.", "My husband is full of these little sayings. I think another he was using was \"put put and move your butt.\" I objected to him explaining crop dusting to our kid so then he came up with other alternative options and its just pointless to try to stop him from using potty humor!", "No worries, I'm not that easily offended, certainly not when I refer to myself in the third person.", "Was thinking the exact same thing!!!\ud83d\ude02 Our swedish culture is probably healthier\ud83d\ude02", "Good point!"]}
