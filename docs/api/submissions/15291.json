Yesterday I was out with a walk in my neighborhood with my dog when I saw a decent amount of smoke coming from in between two homes (with only about 3 ft width between). My first thought was 'wow, risky BBQ moves' but as I am passing I realize the all wood fence butting up to the slide of the building is on fire. I look around and no one is out or noticing that there's a fire. I stand there for a second trying to figure out what to do ultimately deciding that without having anything to put it out, the best thing I can do is call the fire department. \n\nAs I am on the phone with the dispatcher, a UPS truck pulls up and asks what's going on. Thankfully (being the true hero delivery drivers are) once I said it was a fire, the man sprinted out of his truck and poured his liter of Mountain Dew on the fire. It tempers the flame a decent amount but it's not out. \n\nFinally, with the commotion, a guy comes out of the said building in his undies like 'yo wtf' - to which we explain his fence is on fire up against his house and it isn't out. He goes back inside to fill up a pot with water to dump on it. \n\nOther side of the fence guy comes out freaking out. Doesn't want to go near it, panicked about what to do. He asked if anyone called 911, to which I explain that I had. He goes in his house to grab water. No one can immediately tell whether the fire was electrical, some freak accident or something else. \n\nFinally as they are going back and forth in their houses with buckets of water to try and put the fire out, I start to hear the fire sirens coming in the background. Thankfully after a couple of trips of water, the fire is pretty much out and the trucks are coming down the street. \n\nAs I am trying to figure out whether to stay and wait for them to arrive since I was the one who called or get out of the way, I see Mr Underwear guy coming back out of his house with a final bucket of water. I turn his direction and that's when I hear him talking to his girlfriend inside the apartment. Clear as day, he says 'Yeah, some nosey fucking lady called them' clearly talking about the fire sirens and, well, me. \n\nI honestly didn't know what to say. It was at that point I decided to just walk away. But this is seriously bugging me. AITA because I called 911 out of fear that this mans house might catch on fire????", "created_utc": 1682012989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t9f12/aita_for_calling_911/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
