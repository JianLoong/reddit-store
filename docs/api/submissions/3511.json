My mom remarried when I was 4 or maybe 5. I don't really remember a time my stepdad wasn't around, though that's not a very good thing. He's a crappy stepdad and a crappy dad to my siblings (stepsister who is 15, brother who is 10, sister who is 9 and brother who is 7). My mom stays with him though and just let's him not be involved or even nice to his own kids because she doesn't want to be alone. \n\nMy dad's family has been in my life always and am very close to them all. My dad's only sister and I were extra close though. She adored me and always told me I was just like my dad and he was the best man she knew. She said he would be so proud of me. She died a few months ago and left the bulk of everything to me, which she had a lot of assets. \n\nMy mom and stepdad were annoyed when they heard because she left my cousins all something even if not as much as me,, but nothing for my stepsister or siblings who they considered her their aunt as well (dad's family has included them in some stuff to be nice but they're not considered grandkids or anything like that). \n\nMy mom told me what I got should be split equally between us all. I said it shouldn't because my aunt wanted stuff left to me. She told me if I asked my grandparents to give me access to the money now, that they would, and that we could all benefit from it. I told her they would do that but I'm not going to ask. My stepdad told me my siblings will now realize we (me and my paternal family) hate them and don't want them and they will see what a shitty brother I am and what a good sister his daughter is (she actually hates our siblings and has never had a good relationship with them). Mom told me I was hogging more than I would ever need and not thinking of their futures.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: My grandparents already know what is going on and only they can access the money since my aunt set it up that way. If I wanted to access it then I'd need to go through them.

Your aunt left that money to you because she wanted you to have it.  You mom and your stepdad should be taking care of your siblings, not you.  Do NOT give away your money.", "NTA - Your stepfather's children have their own paternal family to care for them as well as your mother's family. In other words, they have two sets of family just as you do. Whether or not those people have assets to share is not your problem. Your aunt left assets to YOU specifically and to her bloodline. You do not owe this money to anyone, not even your siblings. They are not your responsibility. Your mother and stepfather are AH for attempting to manipulate you, a child, out of your assets. Should you, at a later date, choose to gift your siblings something, that is up to you but you should wait until you're a legal adult to decide. \n\nThis is near and dear to my heart because I lost my husband when I was pregnant. I am not remarried, and my son is 6, but should anyone in my late husband's family leave him anything, it would be HIS. I am so sorry your family is acting this way and pressuring you. This is not okay. I would maybe speak confidentially with your grandparents about the situation and see if they can put this in a trust for you. Let them know that your feel that your mother and stepfather would mismanage these assets and ensure an adult is in charge in case they pass away.", "NTA!!! Get your dad's side of the family involved in this!! You need an adult on your side ASAP. Your mom and step dad are trying to manipulate you into getting that money so they can have it. I doubt much would go to you or your step siblings.", "NTA.  And please tell your grandparents and other family members on your dad\u2019s side (whom you trust) about this so they can make sure the money is completely tied up and your mom and stepdad cannot get to it.\n\nSo sorry for your loss, but clearly your aunt loved you and thought the world of you. Remember that always.", "NTA.  Your stepdad is an asshole for claiming that if you don't give up money that must mean you hate people and are a shitty brother.   Your mom just wants the money too, and is married to a greedy asshole, which is sad, but you know where her loyalties lay.\n\nThe money is presumably in trust for you to access when you turn 18 or 25.  You should ask your grandparents for details about that so that you can plan your life.\n\nIf, when you are older, you want to do anything nice for any of your extended family, you can choose to do that later.  But you should not even be thinking about that at age 16.  Just enjoy your life and don't let people pressure you.", "NTA.  If you feel you can talk to your grandparents, it could be a good idea to let them know what's going on.  Your mom should be protecting you and your future, not exploiting you to benefit your siblings.", "NTA.  The inheritance went to you and your cousins as your aunt wished.  Do not allow it to fall into the hands of others.", "NTA. In no way should you split that money with people you aunt wasn't even related to!", "NTA\n\nThis was money/assets your aunt left to YOU, no one else. It's yours to do with as you see fit of course, but your mom and stepdad are completely wrong in trying to bully you into giving them some of the money. \n\nI'd go to the bank and speak to someone about all of this, making sure your money is safe for you and you alone (maybe ask your grandparents for help if you trust them).

Your aunt wanted you, not your mom, or step siblings, or step dad to have the money, it is yours and your alone. Keep it for your future.", "NTA - DO NOT LET ANYONE ELSE HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY. Sorry for the all caps, but it's really important. This is your money, for you, and you do not have any obligation to share it with your step-siblings. Let's be honest, here, it's more likely that you'd be sharing it with your mom and therefore your step-father would feel entitled to it too. You really do not want to go down that path. Make sure things are set up so that your money is protected and ready for you when you turn 18.", "NTA. No one is entitled to anything when someone dies.  Your aunt made a choice to leave her assets to you as was her right.  And you have the right not to share them.  If your family was on the verge of being homeless or your siblings had nothing to eat, then you would be an AH, but that doesn't sound like it's the case.  Would that money make everyone's life easier now? Probably.  Will it make your life easier in the future? Definitely and that's what your aunt intended.  And when you are old enough to access that money  please get a financial advisor so that it can work for your future.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d have a word with your grandparents and let them know you\u2019re being coerced at home.

Don\u2019t let them strong arm you.", "NTA, Get dad's family to safeguard the money until you're 18 and tell your mom thats the end of it. Legally and morally your stepsiblings have no right to a single penny. You're not being an asshole for saving YOUR money. Tell your mom how her actions make it feel like she loves them more than you and it hurts. Any good mother should have a moment of clarity on how stupid they're being. A gift willed by a dead relative goes to who it's willed to, the end. I'm curious if the stepsiblings even care? If they don't tell you mom she's starting unnecessarily drama.", "NTA\n\nIt is your money. Giving/splitting the money actually could have tax implications.\n\nYour aunt decided how to leave her money, not you. Contact a lawyer before anyone comes after you.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nNO, NO, NO! You've been dealt a shitty hand in life with your father's passing. I can sort of understand how your mom latched on to the first jerk that came along, because she was probably feeling like she needed security for you both. However, that was her choice. \n\nYou are still a minor. They should NOT be pressuring you to give your inheritance to them so they can all fritter it away. Just tell them you're not going to do anything with it right now. Then save it to pay for college, a car, a house, an investment... whatever you need to get a good start in life. I'm sure you're going to have to pay some hefty taxes on it, too. JUST SAY NO. If you have to, lie to them and say your grandparents said no, and get your grandparents to agree to the story.", "NTA - First, sorry for your loss.  Secondly, your Aunt left that to YOU, not to anyone else.  In fact, one of the reasons to designate small bequests to your cousins, was so that none of them can challenge the will, saying they were forgotten.  \n\nNow, you Mom and SD want to get their hands of YOUR money.  You should seriously think about becoming 'emanicipated' and living with your grand-parents, as it sounds like you environment is kind of sketchy.", "Sounds like your aunt knew exactly what she was doing and exactly how your mom and stepdad would react. She took the necessary steps to keep the things she wanted YOU to have, protected. \n\nI\u2019m young-ish, and I already know that if something happened to me, exactly how I\u2019d want my assets distributed. I would not like the things I\u2019ve saved for certain people being redistributed because I did it for a reason.", "NTA. If feasible, maybe move in with grandparents. It's only going to get worse. This may tear the family apart, but you do not and should not share with them. This may end in a LC or NC if they keep this up. Good luck and sorry for your losses.", "NTA. Your mom is greedy & entitled  & so is her husband.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nHoly cow. NTA. Money can really tear a family apart and I\u2019m sorry that at 16 you are dealing with this. Sounds like your grandparents have control of what was left to you? Please make them aware of the situation. Make it known to your grandparents that you have zero interest or intention of splitting what was left to you with your siblings or anyone else. I\u2019m not sure what is setup in place in order to be able to withdraw funds but they should know so that nothing shady is pulled from your mother and stepdad.", "NTA sounds like you need to live with your dad's family", "I think you need to have someone from your aunts side help you put everything into a trust for when your older.  that way it doesn't disappear.", "NTA - it was left to you", "NTA - your money, your decision. End of discussion", "Nta, its shitty that they even asked, sounds like your aunt really wanted you to know your dad. Thats really sweet.  I have a six month old and if somthing ever happened to me i hope that someone would do that for him.  Your aunts just trying to do right by her brother who she obviously loved. Even your cousins probably get it. Your aunt sounds awesome and they should respect her wishes.\n\nThey are the adults, they should know this.", "Nta\n\nJust remember to be smart. And don't live beyond your means after you do get the inheritance. At your age it's easy to go overboard. Thinking it will last forever.

That goes for friends too.", "NTA and your aunt protected your inheritance.", "NTA.. your grandparents do need to set up a trust with a lawyer so if anything happens to them before you turn 18, your mom has no access to it as your legal guardian. \nIt\u2019s a really simple process to have it legally closed until you are of age and to be the sole recipient of it. \n\nMy great aunt left me a nice little nest egg and had it drawn up for my to get a lump sump at 18, and the rest at 25.", "Nta I would talk to your grandparents and let them know everything so mom and step dad can't do anything shady.", "NTA.

Please dont let your mom and particularly your stepdad get your hands on this money.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour mother chose to marry your stepfather and go on to have three more kids and parent his daughter. None of which are related to your dad or his family. Your aunt was such a person that, if she wanted them to inherit from her, she would have set it up that way as she did for your cousins. Your aunt wanted you to have an inheritance from her in lieu of your father not being there. Do not let your crappy mom or stepfather make their poor life choices your responsibility. They are the adults and it's their responsibility to care for their children. It isn't and wasn't your aunt's job to 'make their life better'. If life and finances aren't what they need to be, they need to do better and try to improve the situation. Besides, it's good that your aunt was looking out for your future, it's apparent that your mom hasn't.\n\nDon't allow yourself to be intimidated or bullied into taking a red cent of your inheritance.

Sad stuff.\n\n\n\nStand your ground but ask a trusted adult for help, if it gets too much.\n\n\n\nI fear they will try to turn your younger siblings against you to put pressure on you, which is a really *low* move, but don't yield.\n\nMaybe, in the future, when you are older, you can share something with them to help out with their studies, etc - *but only if you feel like it.*\n\n\n\nYou are under NO obligation to do so.\n\n\n\nYour Mom, particularly, sucks for doing this, but it seems like she is stuck in an unhealthy relationship.
