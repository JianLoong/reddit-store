My mom remarried when I was 4 or maybe 5. I don't really remember a time my stepdad wasn't around, though that's not a very good thing. He's a crappy stepdad and a crappy dad to my siblings (stepsister who is 15, brother who is 10, sister who is 9 and brother who is 7). My mom stays with him though and just let's him not be involved or even nice to his own kids because she doesn't want to be alone. \n\nMy dad's family has been in my life always and am very close to them all. My dad's only sister and I were extra close though. She adored me and always told me I was just like my dad and he was the best man she knew. She said he would be so proud of me. She died a few months ago and left the bulk of everything to me, which she had a lot of assets. \n\nMy mom and stepdad were annoyed when they heard because she left my cousins all something even if not as much as me,, but nothing for my stepsister or siblings who they considered her their aunt as well (dad's family has included them in some stuff to be nice but they're not considered grandkids or anything like that). \n\nMy mom told me what I got should be split equally between us all. I said it shouldn't because my aunt wanted stuff left to me. She told me if I asked my grandparents to give me access to the money now, that they would, and that we could all benefit from it. I told her they would do that but I'm not going to ask. My stepdad told me my siblings will now realize we (me and my paternal family) hate them and don't want them and they will see what a shitty brother I am and what a good sister his daughter is (she actually hates our siblings and has never had a good relationship with them). Mom told me I was hogging more than I would ever need and not thinking of their futures.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: My grandparents already know what is going on and only they can access the money since my aunt set it up that way. If I wanted to access it then I'd need to go through them.

Do NOT give away your money.", "NTA - Your stepfather's children have their own paternal family to care for them as well as your mother's family. In other words, they have two sets of family just as you do. Whether or not those people have assets to share is not your problem. Your aunt left assets to YOU specifically and to her bloodline. You do not owe this money to anyone, not even your siblings. They are not your responsibility. Your mother and stepfather are AH for attempting to manipulate you, a child, out of your assets. Should you, at a later date, choose to gift your siblings something, that is up to you but you should wait until you're a legal adult to decide. \n\nThis is near and dear to my heart because I lost my husband when I was pregnant. I am not remarried, and my son is 6, but should anyone in my late husband's family leave him anything, it would be HIS. I am so sorry your family is acting this way and pressuring you. This is not okay. I would maybe speak confidentially with your grandparents about the situation and see if they can put this in a trust for you. Let them know that your feel that your mother and stepfather would mismanage these assets and ensure an adult is in charge in case they pass away.", "NTA!!! Get your dad's side of the family involved in this!! You need an adult on your side ASAP. Your mom and step dad are trying to manipulate you into getting that money so they can have it. I doubt much would go to you or your step siblings.", "NTA.

Remember that always.", "NTA.  Your stepdad is an asshole for claiming that if you don't give up money that must mean you hate people and are a shitty brother.   Your mom just wants the money too, and is married to a greedy asshole, which is sad, but you know where her loyalties lay.\n\nThe money is presumably in trust for you to access when you turn 18 or 25.  You should ask your grandparents for details about that so that you can plan your life.\n\nIf, when you are older, you want to do anything nice for any of your extended family, you can choose to do that later.  But you should not even be thinking about that at age 16.  Just enjoy your life and don't let people pressure you.", "NTA.

Your mom should be protecting you and your future, not exploiting you to benefit your siblings.", "NTA.  The inheritance went to you and your cousins as your aunt wished.  Do not allow it to fall into the hands of others.", "NTA. In no way should you split that money with people you aunt wasn't even related to!", "NTA\n\nThis was money/assets your aunt left to YOU, no one else.

Let's be honest, here, it's more likely that you'd be sharing it with your mom and therefore your step-father would feel entitled to it too. You really do not want to go down that path. Make sure things are set up so that your money is protected and ready for you when you turn 18.", "NTA. No one is entitled to anything when someone dies.  Your aunt made a choice to leave her assets to you as was her right.  And you have the right not to share them.

Legally and morally your stepsiblings have no right to a single penny. You're not being an asshole for saving YOUR money. Tell your mom how her actions make it feel like she loves them more than you and it hurts. Any good mother should have a moment of clarity on how stupid they're being. A gift willed by a dead relative goes to who it's willed to, the end. I'm curious if the stepsiblings even care? If they don't tell you mom she's starting unnecessarily drama.", "NTA\n\nIt is your money. Giving/splitting the money actually could have tax implications.\n\nYour aunt decided how to leave her money, not you. Contact a lawyer before anyone comes after you.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nNO, NO, NO! You've been dealt a shitty hand in life with your father's passing. I can sort of understand how your mom latched on to the first jerk that came along, because she was probably feeling like she needed security for you both. However, that was her choice. \n\nYou are still a minor. They should NOT be pressuring you to give your inheritance to them so they can all fritter it away. Just tell them you're not going to do anything with it right now. Then save it to pay for college, a car, a house, an investment... whatever you need to get a good start in life. I'm sure you're going to have to pay some hefty taxes on it, too. JUST SAY NO. If you have to, lie to them and say your grandparents said no, and get your grandparents to agree to the story.", "NTA - First, sorry for your loss.  Secondly, your Aunt left that to YOU, not to anyone else.  In fact, one of the reasons to designate small bequests to your cousins, was so that none of them can challenge the will, saying they were forgotten.  \n\nNow, you Mom and SD want to get their hands of YOUR money.  You should seriously think about becoming 'emanicipated' and living with your grand-parents, as it sounds like you environment is kind of sketchy.", "Sounds like your aunt knew exactly what she was doing and exactly how your mom and stepdad would react. She took the necessary steps to keep the things she wanted YOU to have, protected. \n\nI\u2019m young-ish, and I already know that if something happened to me, exactly how I\u2019d want my assets distributed.

Your mom is greedy & entitled  & so is her husband.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nHoly cow. NTA. Money can really tear a family apart and I\u2019m sorry that at 16 you are dealing with this. Sounds like your grandparents have control of what was left to you? Please make them aware of the situation. Make it known to your grandparents that you have zero interest or intention of splitting what was left to you with your siblings or anyone else.

Your aunt wanted you to have an inheritance from her in lieu of your father not being there. Do not let your crappy mom or stepfather make their poor life choices your responsibility. They are the adults and it's their responsibility to care for their children. It isn't and wasn't your aunt's job to 'make their life better'.

I'm sorry you have this relationship with your mom and stepdad. I'm a little afraid for you going forward. I can see your mom and stepdad using this as an excuse to no longer provide for you...", "NTA. Your mom and stepdad are extremely entitled.", "NTA. Great job standing up for yourself and looking out for your own future. In a couple of years you won't need to talk to any of them if you don't want to.", " NTA they just want it for themselves", "NTA \n\nAnd not only should you listen to the advice above about protecting your inheritance. Be very deliberate about how you use it. I myself inherited some money at 18 and i was not mature enough to handle it properly. I wish someone I could trust had stepped in an guided me. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "NTA - And don't let them manipulate you otherwise.  I'm sorry you got stuck with your family and I hope things get better once you're old enough to get out of there.\n\nDo you have any other relatives you can live with for the next 2 years?", "NTA and yikes\u2026that\u2019s a completely unreasonable and quite frankly, insane, request from your mother! Don\u2019t give any of them a cent.", "NTA It was left to you alone.", "NTA. I just wanted to point out you can change your mind later should you want to give one of them some money, you can, in the future. Imo, you should hold tight until you are older and well removed from your current situation and can see how things go while not embroiled. You may never want to give them money,  and that is fine.  I also suggest reading a blog like Mr. Money Moustache for ideas on what to do with your money.", "NTA- your aunt left it to you, she wanted it to go to you. End of story.", "NTA they won\u2019t the money. The money was left to you so you would never have to depend on your mom and stepdad. Do not let them guilt or manipulate you. If they keep this up go ahead and move in with your grandparents. Most states will allow you to live with another trusted adult.", "NTA. Your step siblings are not related to you at all. Your aunt\u2019s wishes were to leave her assets with you. Not the step siblings. Your step dad and mother can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t touch any of that money. It belongs to you", "Watch closely - your mother or her husband may tell your siblings about the situation (which is none of their business) to increase pressure on you. That will tell you that their greed matters more than you do.\n\nI suspect your mother's husband is behind most of this, including manipulating your mother. He may try to trap and twist you in other ways. Avoid him- reduce contact. Moving out would be a good idea.", "> Don\u2019t tell your friends, don\u2019t get some flashy car, you do not want the heat that will bring and the parasites that will come crawling.\n\nThis A MILLION TIMES OVER. The best thing you can do is say NOTHING to anyone about this money. Use it to live your best life and take financial stress away. That money was left by your aunt to YOU - not to support your mother, step sibs, aunts, uncles or cousins. It's for YOU. \n\nNo is a complete sentence.", "NTA. Absolutely! Keep your good fortune to yourself, otherwise, you\u2019ll have friends hitting you up for loans\u2026.that will never paid back. Family members for sure. Trust me, people come out of the woodwork when they smell OPM ( other people\u2019s money). Be smart, and be cautious. Your aunt wanted you to benefit, because you\u2019re a decent guy, and your aunt loved you.", "I second and third this comment. \n\nHaving seen it up close twice, I can tell you people will get completely unhinged when there's money around. They will do things you would never have believed them capable of - especially rationalizing and deluding themselves.", "Make sure you contact a lawyer once you do turn 18 and get control so they dont try anything to get at it.", "I've been in your shoes.  You're taking a smart path. Don't let them try to bully it out of you--you will always regret it and trust me, nothing bites like gratitude--they will resent that they \"should have been\" grateful to you for the GIFT of the money that they didn't deserve or earn.\n\nNTA and stick to your guns.", "That is a very good idea, and no YNTA.", "I just want to add to this you should take some courses on Personal Finance. They even have some free ones on Khan academy.", "Good point. OP should definitely talk to an attorney about setting up a living trust starting at age 18. That should include an advance care directive, a durable power of attorney, and a rollover will to ensure that Mom has no access to anything."]}
