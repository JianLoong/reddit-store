Anyway, the play came and went and he never participated in a play again or ever encouraged us to be in one. When I asked my mother about the play, she just gave me some quiet, sheepish answer how it wasn't appropriate for children. My guess is that his role involved some kind of kissing or other intimate scene that pissed off and embarrassed my mother. (We lived in a small town and the play was at the local amateur theater.)

I would imagine that most wives know exactly what's in all the main drawers in their households. So statistically, she may be in the about 30% that aren't responsible for the majority of household chores. But clearly, you have no concept of what a drawer full of wigs look like. And how cumbersome that would be.\n\nI don't think you're incredibly familiar with the insides of wigs, but they're mesh. So, is he sewing homade fabric labels into plastic mesh, avoiding getting the needle caught on all the hair on the other side? The majority of people with wigs have names for their wigs, and they do not need labels. Why would you need labels for your wig collection of the people in your life? Are there that many? \n\nI mean personally find these to be the 'facts' that aren't fully flushed out.

It's often a version where I 'win' an argument, or at least the comprehension/respect of the other person.  \nDay dreamers will sometimes use tools like clothes to incarnate a person in their daydreams.  \nI have personally thought about getting wigs from Amazon, but where it's a bit different from your husband, is that all my characters are copyrighted ones from TV shows, and the scenes I reenact again and again are original, like taken from parallel stories. The 'emotional' content  is similar because it's about traumas and difficult situations, and it helps me evacuate the stress too. I often need background music to directly enter the story, so I will choose one 'emotional' track from some movie soundtrack.\n\nMaladaptive daydreamers are often people with past traumas or a mental illness like autism, OCD, ADHD... also people who were lonesome and isolated during their childhood and had to cope (escape reality) by creating their own 'perfect' worlds in their minds.  \nEven as adults they can still need to use that way to cope with past traumas or recent events that obsess them because they wish things had happened differently.\n\nDaydreaming is far from being rare, but it is the fear or reactions exactly like yours that force daydreamers to hide their urges to daydream when stressed.  \nI know I sometimes find myself daydreaming at work, about some conversation I had with a difficult client. Some people will pace while speaking with themselves. I only speak to myself in public (but not in front of people), and mime events and play each character when I'm alone at home (then it's more the 'immersive' type of daydreaming because I can choose when it starts and ends. That's the problem with the maladaptive type of daydreaming, it can start suddenly on its own. If your husband plan it it might be more 'immersive'. It's more controllable).  \nI can imagine that your own family would appear so much in your daydreams, that you would need some tool to incarnate each of them. Do you often have arguments? How do you get along?\n\nOf course as I said, MDD be linked to mental illness, and also schizophrenia. But please, it was never to hurt you, just to cope in silence, it is a defense mechanism and it could look 'gross' to see wigs with your names, but the last thing your husband needs is rejection.\n\nOf course he is going to need therapy, but stopping is often impossible for us, because as I said, it is a defense mechanism.
