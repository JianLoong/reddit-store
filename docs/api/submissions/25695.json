Indeed it must be very weird to find your husband like that and it is a good thing that you expressed your discomfort to him.

Is he actually in any plays? Amateur acting can be really troublesome. My stepfather decided to be in a play once, and tried to encourage my mother and the rest of the family to be in plays. He would rehearse his scenes in our living room where he would don a fake Russian accent. It was ridiculous. Anyway, the play came and went and he never participated in a play again or ever encouraged us to be in one. When I asked my mother about the play, she just gave me some quiet, sheepish answer how it wasn't appropriate for children. My guess is that his role involved some kind of kissing or other intimate scene that pissed off and embarrassed my mother. (We lived in a small town and the play was at the local amateur theater.) All I remember is him yelling \"Oh my Rebishka\" (sp?) during his rehearsal sessions. If anyone know what play that might have been, please let me know.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No. What exactly it is? I can't tell you.", "NTA and I\u2019m creeped out over here, let alone being in the same house and bed.\n\nIs this some kind of secret drawer? How have you not known about this before? How did he act when you spoke to him about it? How often does he act as you and your son?

I barely know where I left something I held in my hand two seconds ago. Why are you so sure women specifically know or care about all that? \n\nA label could be on the inside of a wig like there\u2019s labels on the inside of clothes, so that they\u2019re not visible when worn. \n\nThis story does sound far fetched and weird but not for these reasons. But then again there are really weird people in this world.", "I was wondering where the drawer(s) could possibly be that wifey didn't see the wigs, but the creeped out feeling prevailed. \n\nWigs in zip lock bags labeled in Sharpie.", "That\u2019s what he said he was doing, but it still made me creeped out.", "Omg thank you.

I would imagine that most wives know exactly what's in all the main drawers in their households. So statistically, she may be in the about 30% that aren't responsible for the majority of household chores. But clearly, you have no concept of what a drawer full of wigs look like. And how cumbersome that would be.\n\nI don't think you're incredibly familiar with the insides of wigs, but they're mesh. So, is he sewing homade fabric labels into plastic mesh, avoiding getting the needle caught on all the hair on the other side? The majority of people with wigs have names for their wigs, and they do not need labels. Why would you need labels for your wig collection of the people in your life? Are there that many? \n\nI mean personally find these to be the 'facts' that aren't fully flushed out. But if you don't have a system for putting things back where they came from I guess everything makes sense now.", "That\u2019s because it\u2019s creepy. I\u2019d be looking at his browser history to see what he\u2019s looking at", "I'm more wondering how you know the frequency and nature of the behavior. Like, that it was a regular thing rather than practice for a specific performance or something.", "It's time for OP to be checking YouTube...", "Maybe it is real but he\u2019s actually a tiktoker who does those bits where they do the different scenarios, and he\u2019s to embarrassed to admit it lmao", "I mean, what he's doing is certainly weird. But I feel like something is going over my head here - what are you implying would be in his browser history? I'm confused how that would tie into this behavior.", "People google things they\u2019re afraid to ask about. Browser history is a good way to get insight into how he feels, or what benefit he thinks this will bring"]}
