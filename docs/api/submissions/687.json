What do you mean by nonconsensually losing your virginity to him? Did he rape you?", "Technically yes, he put his finger in me when we were making out then stopped when I said stop.", "Did you talk about limits before? I feel all of this is over Reddit's pay grade. On one side he stopped when you asked him on the other hand it seems that he didn't ask permission to penetrate you with your finger.", "Yeah we decided we would do anything that could not result in pregnancy. I overestimated his knowledge about sperm lifespans in surfaces."]}
