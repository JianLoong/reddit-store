My husband has no piercings or tattoos. He's always said he doesn't want any himself but they're fine on other people.\n\nI have had several of my piercings done semi spontaneously, they'll be piercings I've wanted to get done for a while, and while I've had some free time, I've popped to the piercers.\n\nI'm gonna point out that I'm disabled, and it's only been fairly recently that I have been, I started using a cane one year ago, and I've lost a lot of mobility, and control over certain aspects of my body, and I feel like the piercings I have had give me back some control, look cute, and make me feel better about myself. I've also gained a lot of weight very quickly due to meds and not being very mobile, which has been difficult to accept because I used to be a very active person.\n\nTail end of last week, I went and had both of my nipples pierced. I'd mentioned wanting them done before to my husband, and he was like, why those? And I was like, I just like the idea of it, plus they'll look cute, and you and I are the only people who will ever see them. He picked me up from town after some other errands but I hadn't told him yet.\nI was gonna surprise him and be like, look what I had done, but he was immediately busy doing something on the car when we got in, he called me to come look at something, and noticed the outline through my shirt. He asked if I'd had them pierced and I was like yeah, I was gonna show you when you'd done with the car.\nWe ended up having to pop out to see a family member after this, and he took an early night, so he didn't end up seeing them.\n\nBut the next day, he was quiet and very snappy with me, I eventually managed to get him talking, but it ended up with him yelling at me.\nHe's mad at me because I got them done without asking him first! He then said I tried to hide them from him, and wouldn't accept me telling him my plan to surprise him with them, then he said that I've essentially made him feel like I don't care about our intimacy anymore, because he 'doesn't want to taste metal'.\n\nIt's turned into a huge fight that has lasted several days. He's never tried to control what I do with my own body before, and I'm hugely shocked that it's become such a big deal \n\nI ended up taking them out because he made me feel bad. But I really regret that, because I didn't want to get rid of them, and now I've wasted \u00a350, and gone through that pain, and this humongous fight, for nothing.\n\nSo please tell me AITA?\n\nETA: I have tried talking to him about it, and each time I try to talk, he starts yelling.\nI've listened to him, and apologised for not discussing it with him first, and informed him that once healed I'd be able to remove them in seconds, so if there was any metallic taste from the jewellery, that wouldn't be a problem anymore.\nI've told him my reasoning for wanting them done, and how is felt more confident and empowered with them, but he just bought up the metallic taste again.\nAlso, he did not see them (apart from the outline through my top).", "created_utc": 1680543888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12artyq/aita_for_getting_my_nipples_pierced/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Meanwhile, your BF isn't an AH for not liking it. You absolutely have the right to make changes to your own body, but when you're in a relationship, one would think that you'd want to include your s/o before anything major so they could at least have the time to wrap their head around it.", "Your body your choice, but if your fella hates them, then it's not great for the relationship.", "NAH for wanting to be pierced. That's your thing and you can live life how you choose to. But the fact is, you are married and your husband has a right to like and enjoy what he sees in the bedroom. If nipple piercings throw him off and he doesn't like them then it should be respected. And vice versa if the situation was reversed. His likes and dislikes should be taken into consideration too. Maybe you guys could have came up with some kind of compromise. Like taking them out during that time or getting a piercing some where else that he would be ok with. Neither of you are the AH in this situation. You both have rights to what you do and don't like and compromises should be expected within a healthy relationship.", "Radical changes in appearance can upset partners, OP. It's odd that you're surprised by any of this. Your husband HATES your pierced nipples, but knows it's your body and your choice.

Things are calmer now, so I'll pick a time when it's right to apologise again for not thinking to talk to him about it first, but about how the way he reacted with shouting etc isn't acceptable.\n\nThe people saying divorce him etc, this is the first instance of anything like this. Yes we've argued before but we've always managed to work it out. If he were to continually do this, that would be a different matter.\n\nTo the people suggesting counselling to come to terms with the grief/loss of becoming disabled, thanks for the suggestions, this is something I have been considering, as some things I have found hard to come to terms with.\n\nBut with people making assumptions about how my disability affects me, and those implying that because I'm disabled, I need permission to do anything, and making assumptions about my diet, I'm done replying and trying to explain myself.

But my two cents, he's probably struggling with your issues on disability and weight gain (as you are of course) and he might find difficult to find you as attractive as before but he's doing his best. You doing something he doesn't like on your body I think makes him feel like:  \"I am dealing with the other things, it's a struggle because I love her and I want to support her and make her feel good no matter what happens but my brain likes her less.

Watching your partner change and not having any control or being able to change things, is hard.

He's definitely in the wrong for his reaction. But i'll offer a bit of my experience, as gently as possible. When I first started dating my fianc\u00e9 (husband in less than a month!) almost 8 years ago, I was *not,* nor am I now, his \"type.\" He has never liked tattoos or piercings or brightly colored hair, and I have always had all of these and still have tattoos and bright hair. When we were younger, we had conversations about how he felt it looked immature and I think at that point, he was just projecting some discomfort about how even though he was only 3 years older than me, he felt more \"grown up,\" because yeah, your 20's are a period of rapid personal growth and there's a big difference between 21 and 24. Now that we're older, his insecurities about that no longer exist, but since then, I have gained about 60 lbs. I know he still finds me attractive, but when I do get a new tattoo, he tends to seem a bit less supportive these days. He has never been harsh with me about my appearance in any way or decisions I make about my own body, but I do sometimes get the feeling that my weight gain makes it more difficult for him to overlook the things he has always disliked that I actively continue to choose to do. Maybe it's a stab in the dark, but i'd guess it's something like this that's causing his overreaction.", "NTA its your body you can do what you want with it.

I would say NAH but his reaction of yelling and the inability to discuss his disappointment and frustration without being an AH raises my eyebrow. He can go a few weeks without nip nop noms and then you would be able to remove them, but it's clear by hus reaction that the taste wasn't the only issue, just the one he was willing to admit.

Its not like you went and impulsively got a large face tattoo (which maybe just mention pre-session if you decide to go for that next), nipple piercings are fairly innocuous, sure it'll be a little different during sex, but day to day it's not going to have any impact on him at all.

My husband has no piercings or tattoos. He's always said he doesn't want any himself but they're fine on other people.\n\nI have had several of my piercings done semi spontaneously, they'll be piercings I've wanted to get done for a while, and while I've had some free time, I've popped to the piercers.\n\nI'm gonna point out that I'm disabled, and it's only been fairly recently that I have been, I started using a cane one year ago, and I've lost a lot of mobility, and control over certain aspects of my body, and I feel like the piercings I have had give me back some control, look cute, and make me feel better about myself. I've also gained a lot of weight very quickly due to meds and not being very mobile, which has been difficult to accept because I used to be a very active person.\n\nTail end of last week, I went and had both of my nipples pierced. I'd mentioned wanting them done before to my husband, and he was like, why those? And I was like, I just like the idea of it, plus they'll look cute, and you and I are the only people who will ever see them. He picked me up from town after some other errands but I hadn't told him yet.\nI was gonna surprise him and be like, look what I had done, but he was immediately busy doing something on the car when we got in, he called me to come look at something, and noticed the outline through my shirt. He asked if I'd had them pierced and I was like yeah, I was gonna show you when you'd done with the car.\nWe ended up having to pop out to see a family member after this, and he took an early night, so he didn't end up seeing them.\n\nBut the next day, he was quiet and very snappy with me, I eventually managed to get him talking, but it ended up with him yelling at me.\nHe's mad at me because I got them done without asking him first! He then said I tried to hide them from him, and wouldn't accept me telling him my plan to surprise him with them, then he said that I've essentially made him feel like I don't care about our intimacy anymore, because he 'doesn't want to taste metal'.\n\nIt's turned into a huge fight that has lasted several days. He's never tried to control what I do with my own body before, and I'm hugely shocked that it's become such a big deal \n\nI ended up taking them out because he made me feel bad. But I really regret that, because I didn't want to get rid of them, and now I've wasted \u00a350, and gone through that pain, and this humongous fight, for nothing.\n\nSo please tell me AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But at the same time, anything that directly affects intimacy with your partner should be a joint decision. He\u2019s free to be upset that you didn\u2019t bother to give him the chance to voice his opinion or that you took forever to show him. How hard is it to say \u201ccome in here so I can show you my boobs\u201d? \n\nIf he decided to get a penis piercing that put it out of commission for a week or two and affected your experience, should he have consulted you? And I don\u2019t mean mentioning in passing that you\u2019re thinking of it. A real discussion that you\u2019re choosing to do it, why, and asking what he thinks. It\u2019s up to you to ignore his feelings at that point or not. But at least give him a chance to share. Just as he should do for you. \n\nJust because he\u2019s fine with SOME piercings or tattoos doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s fine with ALL of them. Nobody wants to experience their attraction for their partner diminish. But there are definitely some piercings and tats that would kill mine. Some I would end the relationship over.

And as someone who has gotten a piercing that their partner didn't know about or love at first, equal partnership does not apply here. This is OP's body, not husband's. If he really finds it difficult to perform certain parts of intimacy then they can find another work around, like not doing nipple play until it's healed then swapping it out. Otherwise, frankly, he needs to keep his opinions on it to himself. OP, NTA.

Just can\u2019t imagine not caring about that potential impact. \n\nBut I\u2019m guessing things were innocuous enough on your part and you simply had no reason to expect he wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. Fair enough. He shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way he did. No reason for him to lose his cool over something so trivial. He could\u2019ve cooly explained how he feels, which would\u2019ve probably ended with the same outcome (you taking them out) and no hard feelings.\n\nSo I guess a little E S H and a little N A H lol. I think you\u2019re both justified in your reasoning, but made some mistakes in how you handled the situation. You should\u2019ve had the foresight to touch base with your partner before doing it, and he should\u2019ve had the self restraint to stay calm when discussing the subject.\n\nI suppose tho that lack of anger management control is a greater slight than lack of foresight\u2026 so I\u2019ll give you the edge in this scenario op.

If it really affects a relationship that much then they can leave. Yelling and fighting about it is not okay. IMO a relationship should be based on much more than something superficial like whether or not you have piercings/tattoos. And, again, if it is that big of a deal that person is free to leave.

Her current solution is obviously not working out and I suspect her boyfriend has only tolerated her piercings because he loves her but there's only so much he can take.\n\nIf her disability is permanent she really needs to focus on modifying her diet for a more sedentary life for her own sake; sedentary and overweight are a _terribly_ unhealthy combination.  I know certain meds do cause weight gain but I also know this can be offset, if not completely dealt with, by having a tailored diet.\n\nEdit: I don't like how the fight continued for days, her husband could also do with some professional help.

I've run into men who love them and men who hate them; the ones that hate them make comments about how they \"clank\" against their teeth. Never heard the metallic taste thing.", "It seems to me he's pretty obviously only been tolerating the body modifications and finds them unattractive.\n\nThis was simply the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nEdit: the weight gain also likely factors into this.  You said you were very active before so I think it's safe to say your boyfriend probably isn't into larger women.\n\nSo it's that plus the appearance of a sudden, undiscussed body modification.", "Oh it's a shame you took them out then. He must have really pitched a fit for you to have done that. I can see why you would want to know the real reason but also maybe not worth it to have another row.", "Why didn't he want to see them?", "He didn't seem very clear that he didn't like them though. If you read her comments, he only said \"why those\"? \n\nTrue, we only have the one side though. Maybe he said something else that OP didn't hear or take into account.", "This needs to be upvoted. Her \u201csurprise\u201d was hey babe you can\u2019t touch my nipples for at least 3 months, possibly longer. I\u2019ve had mine for about 7 years now and that first year was rough", "I mean he married her with the other piercings. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He said something to the effect of, I don't need to see them.", "I'm actually interested to know how many she did have before they married.\n\nShe says she gets them \"semi spontaneously\" and given his reaction I'd be willing to bet this isn't the first time he's been left out of the loop.", "When you mentioned getting them done and he said 'why those?' Was there any follow up, like 'I'm not a huge fan' or 'but I love how you look as is'?", "Hey, I don't mean to pry but I think some additional context would be helpful because I think your issue is larger than just the piercings.\n\nOkay I guess I do mean to pry but I'm not being nefarious I swear. \n\nWould you be willing to expand on a few things?   \n\n* What is the nature of your disability?  Is it permanent or temporary?\n\n* Has your disability caused financial issues? \n\n* You said you were active in your OP; how active were you and did your husband join you in those activities?\n\n* How many times have you left him out of the loop in a decision that impacts your marriage? Is this the first time or has there been other surprise piercings/whatever? \n\n* Are you receiving any sort of support for your depression?\n\n\nI'm sorry if any of these come off as accusatory, that's not my intention.", "I haven't read all your responses, so I'll just pick this... He probably is no longer attracted to your nipples because you've pierced them and he really doesn't want to say that.", "She said she had a few before the marriage but it reads like they were limited to her ears and face. Maybe body piercings are his limit.", "Nope, nothing like that, just said okay"]}
