He didn't seem to have any issues and agreed with everything.\n\nToday, a random woman messaged me on Facebook with a screenshot of his profile picture and nickname on another site, asking if he was my son. I said yes and asked why, and she sent me some horrible videos (the site turned out to be Tiktok) of very obvious racial \"jokes\" and dogwhistles. Not sure if those \"basketball people\" \"jokes\" have made their way onto Reddit, but that type of thing. I really wanted to believe it was some troll who stole his picture, but even though his face wasn't in the videos, I could recognize things from some of the them, like a corner of his room in one and his shoes in another. \n\nI chatted with the woman who showed it to me for a bit and she explained that he'd left a horrid comment on a video of hers and she'd seen his posts from that... which means he wasn't just making his own bigoted content, he was going out of his way to bully people, too. He leaves his phone at home during school so I checked it just to be 100% certain it was him... I was really in denial, I've never seen any of this behavior from him before. It was definitely his account, and the woman who messaged me showed me how to check his comment history... I won't get into it. I backed up his photos to his drive and destroyed the phone. \n\nWhen he got home, I sat him down and asked about the account and he brushed it off as no big deal, just jokes, etc. I asked why he thinks these things are normal, whether his friends are into that kind of thing, and he didn't really give me a response. When I told him I destroyed his phone and he wouldn't be getting another until he proves he's learned better, he was obviously upset, but again insisted he was just joking so it's overkill so he'll get another soon. Since he didn't seem to understand the issue and kept minimizing it, I said that we're going to need to do some \"homework\" over the next few weeks to educate him about the impact of things like that. He pouted about it for a few hours then came around to that, but was still VERY upset about the phone, saying he needs it to keep in contact with his friends. I told him he's welcome to use my phone to text or call them at any time, but he said it's not the same. I understand that, but it's not supposed to be.\n\nMy gf of under a year - so not his stepmom yet but involved in his life to a degree - thinks that it was cruel to outright destroy the phone, especially without letting him get stuff off it. I explained that I backed up the photos but she said there may have been other stuff he wanted to save and there was no reason for me to wreck it instead of just taking it away.\n\nWas it over the line to destroy his phone, AITA for that part?\n\n\nEDIT:  it was an outdated hand me down phone worth spit so money isn't a factor, we were planning to upgrade it at the end of the year anyway", "created_utc": 1692483080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vt80u/aita_for_destroying_my_sons_phone/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Folks seem really concerned about the phone as though the crux of this post is your carbon footprint and not your parental and societal obligation not to raise a racist. Whether you throw the phone in a shoebox or shoot it by cannon to Mars doesn't really matter. Your son proved that he's not safe owning that item until he gains some serious socio-emotional tools, which will take considerable time to be built. Sounds like what he's interacting with has been vaguely radicalizing him. Of course kids are naturally drawn to what's pithy \u2014 desiring to push boundaries and toe the line \u2014 which TikTok in particular is terrifyingly excellent at encouraging. The more you look at that stuff, the more (and worse) it'll show you. It's a one-way ratchet. The fact that he's graduated to *making* the harmful content, and not just consuming it, is particularly alarming. His brain is being taught in real time to seek reward by punching down\u2014among other unfortunate lessons at hand here.\n\nSome will call your reaction draconian. Good. Be draconian.

I think the destroying was maybe overkill. I could be wrong but I get the feeling that destroying it was more out of anger or frustration rather than trying to teach a lesson.

I have seen people on TikTok over silly joke get fired to their job, get harassed on their social media because they made silly jokes on serious sujets. Like the 2 ladies who bullied someone at a play, the whole internet went to then they had to do public apology and ask for people to leave them alone and later even delete all their social media because their social life was ruined.. or the guy who made a joke and aggressive take off some weave at a public place that, and saying raciste think after claiming it was a joke, later got fired, social life ruined, had to leave social medial because of how people were going after them.", "I will never understand parents who opt to destroy electronics instead of just taking it away/locking it up.

Such as a divorce, move, death, etc.\n\nIs it possible that he is acting out because of it?\n\nDoes he have any new adult mentors, such as a teacher or friend's parent that is changing the way he views the world?\n\nAre there any videos or programs that he is watching that he shouldn't be?\n\nHas he had a bad experience with an individual person from the minorities that he is targeting and decided that it must be because of their race/sexuality/gender/religion instead of that individual person?\n\nDo his friends find this funny?

Obviously your son needs punishment and education. Definitely not wrong of you to take his phone away. But, why the fuck would you actually destroy it? Just, take it away. You could have given it to someone in need, sold it, whatever, but destroying it to prove a point? Super wasteful and unnecessary.", "YTA - In the sense, it's a waste of money destroying a phone. You could as easily take it away for whatever time you felt it was necessary for him to learn his lesson.\n\nEventually he will need a phone, even if in a year or more...", "First things first it's none of your girlfriend's business. Second thing she's so wrong. Third fantastic parenting keep it up! NTA.", "YTA\n\nOne of the most important things to do, as a parent, is to model good behavior.  You were mad by what your son did, so you destroyed his property.  \n\nDo you really want to teach and model the lesson \"if you are mad at someone, destroy their property\"? \n\nPlus, when you were talking about the actual problem, the racism that he's starting to display, him being upset about his phone being destroyed is going to distract him from the lesson you need to teach him about the value of being anti-racist and promoting equality. \n\nTo fix this situation, you need to get him to engage with you, not drive him away. \n\nMight I suggest a family movie night?  Once a week, choose a movie that is about a social issue related to racism and prejudice.  Watch it with him, pausing as necessary, and discussing it after. Maybe take him out for brunch the next day, and talk about it some more once he's had a chance to think about what he's seen.\n\nThere are lots of options.  Schindler's List.  Till.  Hidden Figures. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Gandhi.  Plus all sorts of documentaries, and both fiction and non-fiction literature.  \n\nEngage and educate.  It's the only way your son will change, not just the security settings on his social media, but his actual thoughts and understanding.", "YTA, imo.  \nTaking his phone away would have been a more mature response. Destroying his property (you bought it and gave it to him, it IS his) just teaches him that that's the correct response to situations like this.   \nLike don't get me wrong he 100% deserves to be punished, but i'll never be in favor of destroying things that belong to your child... just teaches them to be destructive in the future.", "If your question is specifically about destroying the phone, then yes. YTA. That was total overkill. Why not just take it from him? Or confront him about the content and bullying by showing him what you\u2019ve seen. Still, if you\u2019re dead set on permanently removing your kid\u2019s phone, give it to a charity or goodwill.

I understand your son was up to no good on the internet but we\u2019ve all done stupid things when we were young (I know for a fact that I was a little shit growing up) and that\u2019s a part of life. \n\nI think confiscating the phone, educating your son and when he\u2019s ready, give the phone back. \n\nI feel you went over the top - Although, that being said, great learning curve for your son.", "ESH.

I think that if it is, it's not adults but peers, as he switched schools early this year and made a new friend group.

You do not want your son to become a proud boy or skin head. \n\nBesides taking away his phone I think you need to monitor his internet activities and that your son needs a psychiatrist that specializes in teenagers.", "Also, electronics are really expensive, I'm surprised people can afford to destroy it.", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner... even the Wikipedia article is interesting.", "Have you done anything with his accounts? If they haven't been deactivated or deleted,  his terrible content will still be available with borrowed devices, which can still be linked to you.", "Especially when letting him keep the ohoke would likely just make him continue down the path to be a racist, I feel like we've gone backwards recently, where I am all the kids are following shitty Andrew tate now and its really sad to see such a step back", "That's a good one, too.  And if you want something lighter to slip into the mix, there is always Mel Brooks.  \"Blazing Saddle\" and \"To Be or Not To Be\", although those work a bit better, in terms  of education on racism, for someone who has a grasp of the basic concepts going into the movie.", "How about give it away if he's that disgusted...", "YTA. Don't destroy phones, especially your kid's. It's not a matter of money or morality. Destroying property expresses violence that you justified. What stops your kid from justifying his own form of violence? Maybe he thinks acting like he does online is okay like you think destroying a phone is okay. Not entirely different IMO. If you still think destroying stuff is cool or okay, maybe you should join your kid and do some \"homework\" as to why you express yourself so violently. I think you are ashamed of yourself since you build such a strong case for why destroying the phone was justified. Take sometime and fix that as you help your kid with what looks like the same issue from an outside perspective.", "> and there was no reason for me to wreck it instead of just taking it away.\n\nExactly. Even if it's not worth any money wise, what's the point exactly? Just to show him you can destroy his stuff whenever you want to? ESH.", "NTA. Destroying the phone sends a very clear message that you're not messing around. If he has a computer, you're going to want to lock down his socials there too. Are his friends involved in these videos & comments too?\n\nYou're a parent who has activated your parent mode. YES! More of this! Now comes the hard part. Deprogramming him. Teaching him empathy. He's still young. He can still be taught. \n\nIt's VERY telling that so many people who work for these social media companies do not allow their children to use the sites while they are still children. These algorithms are harmful.", "You really need to explain carbon footprint to him. This could affect getting into competitive colleges and first jobs. He is a bully. Therapy may be in order.", "NTA but did you take down the accounts and delete everything? Ifnot, they're both still out there potentially leading back to him in a way that could affect you/him later in life while still showing those hateful messages AND could potentially be accessed by him using another device. Might be worth just deleting them or, after having him do research and understand why he was wrong, forcing him to go through to confront and delete them himself.", "NTA.\n\nI'd honestly tell him outright that contacting his friends is off the table for a while too - because some of those friends had to have known about his internet activities and egged each other on. A break from all that would be salutary.", "NTA although I wouldn't have destroyed it myself.", "I do think your son needs a cell phone for emergencies. Do they still have old style flip phones? Definitely don\u2019t reward him with a smart phone.\n\nOther than leaving him completely without a phone, I agree 100% with what you did.  Your son is 13 and was probably radicalized by TikTok, so now you get to deprogram him. NTA", "NTA. As someone who had friends who went down that path, it is important to stop it as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, going through his phone is a violation of privacy, you already knew it was him and should have confronted him, maybe make him show you the account, and taken the phone instead. Destroying it is also a bit much, sometimes rubbing stuff in like that makes the kid forget the issue and only remember that you\u2019ll go that far. \n\nI hope your kid isn\u2019t too far gone, here\u2019s to hoping he\u2019ll become a well adjusted individual.", "Info: did you destroy the phone in front of him? Was there any element that might seem like a show of force? Because if so thats pretty bad IMO.\n\nYour sons behavior is definitely very bad though, and I hope he turns around before its too late. He's young, so im sure with the right support he will.", "NTA", "NTA, and thank you.", "This right here.  Most research says social media is a negative influence on teens and his behavior kinda confirms it.  No smart phones until he proves he has grown more mature and ready to take on the responsibility of having access to social media.", "Honestly, at this point I would poke around and see if they still make those phones like some of us had in the early 2000's that can only make calls or texts to a handful of pre-approved numbers. Right now he doesn't even deserve the privilege of unrestricted calling/texting.", "A married couple I know have three kids.  The kids have ZERO presence online.  No pictures of them, nothing.  And they recently decided the oldest(10y) doesn't NEED a cell phone.  They'll revisit the idea when she's 12y.", "Yes, definitely. I understand how you would think that given I wasn't able to provide much context surrounding her - to clarify, she's been nothing but progressive since I've known her. She's also chinese and a not-so-infrequent victim of racism herself, so it's not something she takes lightly. That didn't factor into her argument against me destroying the phone.", "Because racism and bigotry isn't just a lesson like don't look at porn It's something that will ruin all of that's kids relationships and his entire future.", "Light gaming trash talk and hateful bigotry against minorities are not the same thing, and if you think they are, your opinion on this matter is not welcome.", "I did delete everything yes, I saved things for evidence/to refer back to then took down each video individually and deleted the account. Thank you", "Oh no, definitely not, I just broke it and threw it out after backing it up and then told him it was gone later when we talked", "Social media is negative for everyone and I'm grateful I grew up before it became so integral to daily life. I deleted all my accounts a couple years ago and regret nothing! Any time someone tries to talk me into it I pretty much tell them to get off my lawn lol.", "They do!  A lot of people are stepping away from the social media implosion and want phones that just do the basics of calls, texts and maybe pictures.  So companies have started putting these type of phones back out there.\n\nOh and NTA.  People can call it draconian, but it gets a point across like nothing else.", "Alright youre definitely NTA. Good on you for keeping him away from horrible racist influences.", "I did delete everything yes, thank you", "Stupid question, slightly off-topic- I will probably be getting my tween son a phone in the next few years, where do kids \u201cfollow\u201d Andrew Tate & similar? Tik too, insta, YouTube? I only use Instagram for family& friends, then for workouts I never do and recipes I never make so I\u2019m a bit green on where kids find these losers- thanks to anyone who answers!", "It is about the act of disrespect.  I made my son smash his own iPhone with a hammer, himself.  He has never had another iPhone.  You want to disrespect in an abhorrent way, I will make you feel how you tried to make others feel because not raising someone to hurt others for pleasure.  That has to be destroyed when you see it to prevent future pain and to give your child a chance at happiness.", "Yeah, everything you listed. The bigger problem is the reliance of these platforms on their algorithms, which will take note of videos that generate massive engagement (whether positive or negative) and promote them to stimulate further engagement; and thus videos designed to be controversial, or otherwise filled with racist and misogynistic drivel, like Tate's, actually get *pushed* to users\u2014e.g., for Youtube, this'd be on the front page under *suggested videos.* You might click out of curiosity, click out of rage, click out of enjoyment\u2014the site doesn't and couldn't distinguish between any of these; engagement is engagement. If you click, it'll only recommend more, because it thinks it's \"learning\" what interests you. Unfortunately, for the user, this also works in reverse. You're learning to be interested.\n\nSorry, edit just to add: I'm not a dad so take this with a grain of salt, but I do use all those apps, and I think the best thing you can do for your son is to just talk to him about this shit. Like bring up Andrew Tate, bring up Jordan Peterson, bring up racist/sexist/homophobe dogwhistles, et cetera. Talk about them openly with him and teach him these dudes aren't edgy, they're losers. It's kinda like, you can try to guard your son from a virus forever or you can inoculate him against it. Hope that makes sense.", "All of those, and more. Idiots repost his shit on every single platform. It's hard to stay away, the only safe places are tumblr and probably here, as long as you stay away from incel subs", "YTA, you've just reinforced any extreme views by having an extreme reaction to it. Congrats.", "NTA amazing parenting, you sound like a good person who wants what\u2019s best for his son without letting him do whatever he wants at other expense. Glad you did what you did", "NTA. There is a\"Food\" Tik Toker who needs get phone destroyed. I say you did right. He was using the phone for bigoted content, bye bye phone! He can't be trusted. \n\nSo glad you faced it had on and attacked the situation. We need more parents like you because teen bigots grow up to be bigoted cops and judges", "NTA.\n\nI was really ready to vote Y T A, because I imagined you smashing the phone to bits with a hammer in front of him and screaming at him after he was on it too much, or some other damaging power-trip.\n\nBut no. You saw your son headed down a very bad path, and you took immediate steps to course correct.\n\n>Since he didn't seem to understand the issue and kept minimizing it, I said that we're going to need to do some \"homework\" over the next few weeks to educate him about the impact of things like that.\n\nThis is a good parenting method. If a kid behaves in a racist or sexist manner, making them study the history and culture of the group they discriminated against can really help them to learn better.", "NTA\n\nYour gf doesn't get an opinion on your son, first of all. You're handling it quite well, enforcing an education over why his behavior was wrong, not denying him the ability to contact his friends through your phone, saving his photos. But if the phone is still working and just off, nothing might stop him from stealing it to use without you knowing.  \n\n\nThere is the option of a flip phone Jitterbug with no internet access if it becomes an issue that he NEEDS to stay in contact with you in the future.", "You're TA for destroying a phone you could have resold and recouped some of your money on, but not for punishing your son. I'm glad you're teaching him not to be a racist jerk online, we have too many of those already.", "NTA, but confiscating the phone would have been cheaper.", "YTA for destroying the phone. But only because I can\u2019t abide people wrecking things that work. He should have had it removed and then had to earn it back. Otherwise I think I would have handled the issue in a similar way.", "NTA but you can just hide it somewhere. When he starts behaving good then you can give it back.", "You not the asshole here, he was being immature and a bully, destroying it may have been overkill but it\u2019s better than letting him say a bunch of derogatory shit on the internet all day.\n\nMaybe no more smart phones for him", "Maybe a basic flip phone for emergencies would work instead?", "That was my thought, too", "As long as your kind have your number memorized by heart there's enough other people around with phones that your kids can always contact you basically. I've had students of mine ask to use my phone to get picked up from practice, it's no big deal. And having no social media until you're older is a huge plus", "Aside from everything else here, it is really poor internet safety to allow him to use his unique name online in a public capacity.", "Seriously explain what objective was accomplished via destruction that could not have been accomplished through confiscation or a factory reset and sale, which outweighed the polution a new phone generates.", "Except for this account, apparently.", "To let the son know the severity of what he did. She calmly let him know that it's gone. No way to get it back from who she sold it to, no way to steal it back. Plus, the planets already fucked stop trying to use one damn cellphone as pOlUtIoN when the large corporations are tye main issue here", "You provided no objective selling or merely withholding would not accomplish, without the downside of the pollution. Please try again.", "You apparently can't read. The son could take or buy it back from the person his mother sold it to. Please try again.", "How? Turn the phone off, put it in a zip lock bag and hide it in the attic, inside the shell of the washing machine, etc, how will the kid know where too look? Sell to a pawn shop, and not tell the kid which one....\n\nHow is this child going to magically know where to get the phone from? Please explain. If the mother owns the phone, merely go through the hoops to inform the company who made it, it has been sold, so her son can't make a theft report to track it, and wipe all its accounts, and what physics defying techniques will he use to track it?", "You would be surprised just how resourceful kids are.", "How will the child get the phone back? If you can not give a method, what stops the child from merely stealing a random phone to accomplish the same objective?"]}
