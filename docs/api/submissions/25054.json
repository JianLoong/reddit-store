He didn't seem to have any issues and agreed with everything.\n\nToday, a random woman messaged me on Facebook with a screenshot of his profile picture and nickname on another site, asking if he was my son. I said yes and asked why, and she sent me some horrible videos (the site turned out to be Tiktok) of very obvious racial \"jokes\" and dogwhistles. Not sure if those \"basketball people\" \"jokes\" have made their way onto Reddit, but that type of thing. I really wanted to believe it was some troll who stole his picture, but even though his face wasn't in the videos, I could recognize things from some of the them, like a corner of his room in one and his shoes in another. \n\nI chatted with the woman who showed it to me for a bit and she explained that he'd left a horrid comment on a video of hers and she'd seen his posts from that... which means he wasn't just making his own bigoted content, he was going out of his way to bully people, too. He leaves his phone at home during school so I checked it just to be 100% certain it was him... I was really in denial, I've never seen any of this behavior from him before. It was definitely his account, and the woman who messaged me showed me how to check his comment history... I won't get into it. I backed up his photos to his drive and destroyed the phone. \n\nWhen he got home, I sat him down and asked about the account and he brushed it off as no big deal, just jokes, etc. I asked why he thinks these things are normal, whether his friends are into that kind of thing, and he didn't really give me a response. When I told him I destroyed his phone and he wouldn't be getting another until he proves he's learned better, he was obviously upset, but again insisted he was just joking so it's overkill so he'll get another soon. Since he didn't seem to understand the issue and kept minimizing it, I said that we're going to need to do some \"homework\" over the next few weeks to educate him about the impact of things like that. He pouted about it for a few hours then came around to that, but was still VERY upset about the phone, saying he needs it to keep in contact with his friends. I told him he's welcome to use my phone to text or call them at any time, but he said it's not the same. I understand that, but it's not supposed to be.\n\nMy gf of under a year - so not his stepmom yet but involved in his life to a degree - thinks that it was cruel to outright destroy the phone, especially without letting him get stuff off it. I explained that I backed up the photos but she said there may have been other stuff he wanted to save and there was no reason for me to wreck it instead of just taking it away.\n\nWas it over the line to destroy his phone, AITA for that part?\n\n\nEDIT:  it was an outdated hand me down phone worth spit so money isn't a factor, we were planning to upgrade it at the end of the year anyway", "created_utc": 1692483080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vt80u/aita_for_destroying_my_sons_phone/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Folks seem really concerned about the phone as though the crux of this post is your carbon footprint and not your parental and societal obligation not to raise a racist. Whether you throw the phone in a shoebox or shoot it by cannon to Mars doesn't really matter. Your son proved that he's not safe owning that item until he gains some serious socio-emotional tools, which will take considerable time to be built. Sounds like what he's interacting with has been vaguely radicalizing him. Of course kids are naturally drawn to what's pithy \u2014 desiring to push boundaries and toe the line \u2014 which TikTok in particular is terrifyingly excellent at encouraging. The more you look at that stuff, the more (and worse) it'll show you. It's a one-way ratchet. The fact that he's graduated to *making* the harmful content, and not just consuming it, is particularly alarming. His brain is being taught in real time to seek reward by punching down\u2014among other unfortunate lessons at hand here.\n\nSome will call your reaction draconian. Good. Be draconian.

I think the destroying was maybe overkill. I could be wrong but I get the feeling that destroying it was more out of anger or frustration rather than trying to teach a lesson.

I have seen people on TikTok over silly joke get fired to their job, get harassed on their social media because they made silly jokes on serious sujets. Like the 2 ladies who bullied someone at a play, the whole internet went to then they had to do public apology and ask for people to leave them alone and later even delete all their social media because their social life was ruined.. or the guy who made a joke and aggressive take off some weave at a public place that, and saying raciste think after claiming it was a joke, later got fired, social life ruined, had to leave social medial because of how people were going after them.", "I will never understand parents who opt to destroy electronics instead of just taking it away/locking it up.

Such as a divorce, move, death, etc.\n\nIs it possible that he is acting out because of it?\n\nDoes he have any new adult mentors, such as a teacher or friend's parent that is changing the way he views the world?\n\nAre there any videos or programs that he is watching that he shouldn't be?\n\nHas he had a bad experience with an individual person from the minorities that he is targeting and decided that it must be because of their race/sexuality/gender/religion instead of that individual person?\n\nDo his friends find this funny?

Obviously your son needs punishment and education. Definitely not wrong of you to take his phone away. But, why the fuck would you actually destroy it? Just, take it away. You could have given it to someone in need, sold it, whatever, but destroying it to prove a point? Super wasteful and unnecessary.", "YTA - In the sense, it's a waste of money destroying a phone. You could as easily take it away for whatever time you felt it was necessary for him to learn his lesson.\n\nEventually he will need a phone, even if in a year or more...", "First things first it's none of your girlfriend's business. Second thing she's so wrong. Third fantastic parenting keep it up! NTA.", "YTA\n\nOne of the most important things to do, as a parent, is to model good behavior.  You were mad by what your son did, so you destroyed his property.  \n\nDo you really want to teach and model the lesson \"if you are mad at someone, destroy their property\"? \n\nPlus, when you were talking about the actual problem, the racism that he's starting to display, him being upset about his phone being destroyed is going to distract him from the lesson you need to teach him about the value of being anti-racist and promoting equality. \n\nTo fix this situation, you need to get him to engage with you, not drive him away. \n\nMight I suggest a family movie night?  Once a week, choose a movie that is about a social issue related to racism and prejudice.  Watch it with him, pausing as necessary, and discussing it after. Maybe take him out for brunch the next day, and talk about it some more once he's had a chance to think about what he's seen.\n\nThere are lots of options.  Schindler's List.  Till.  Hidden Figures. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Gandhi.  Plus all sorts of documentaries, and both fiction and non-fiction literature.  \n\nEngage and educate.  It's the only way your son will change, not just the security settings on his social media, but his actual thoughts and understanding.", "YTA, imo.  \nTaking his phone away would have been a more mature response. Destroying his property (you bought it and gave it to him, it IS his) just teaches him that that's the correct response to situations like this.   \nLike don't get me wrong he 100% deserves to be punished, but i'll never be in favor of destroying things that belong to your child... just teaches them to be destructive in the future.", "If your question is specifically about destroying the phone, then yes. YTA. That was total overkill. Why not just take it from him? Or confront him about the content and bullying by showing him what you\u2019ve seen. Still, if you\u2019re dead set on permanently removing your kid\u2019s phone, give it to a charity or goodwill.

I understand your son was up to no good on the internet but we\u2019ve all done stupid things when we were young (I know for a fact that I was a little shit growing up) and that\u2019s a part of life. \n\nI think confiscating the phone, educating your son and when he\u2019s ready, give the phone back. \n\nI feel you went over the top - Although, that being said, great learning curve for your son.", "ESH.

I think that if it is, it's not adults but peers, as he switched schools early this year and made a new friend group.
