Since she is old, I try not to show my contempt when she asks me to help her all the time and doesn't even bother asking my brother (23) (All four of us live together, it is normal in my country). They don't care that I'm doing my master's and I have so much to study.\r  \n\r  \nRecently, my uncle (my father's BIL) passed away and her wife (my father's sister) lives alone now. She is 70 and has a daughter who lives with her family only a few miles away. Let's call her Nina. Now, Nina is supposed to take care of her mother obviously. But Nina's MIL and husband don't like my aunt staying with them. Fair enough, but isn't it her responsibility to visit her mom frequently and take care of her?\r  \n\r  \nMy mom goes out of her way to visit my aunt whenever she calls her. We live far away and it takes 2 hours from my home to my aunt's. Even for mild leg pain or hip sprain, she calls my mother, crying, and asks her to take her to the nearby hospital (she can literally take a taxi and go). And my mum goes every time. \r  \n\r  \nWhile my mum is gone, I have to clean the house, do the laundry, do the dishes, cook dinner, and go to the market AFTER coming home from college, while my dad and brother do not move an inch of their asses. \r  \n \r  \nAlmost 20 years ago, my dad and his siblings had a huge fight due to a property dispute (where ugly words were thrown at my father, my mother, and us (me and my brother were 4 and 6 years old) and we were threatened to leave the house. We went No Contact with all of them for so long. And only 5 years ago they somehow had to see each other again. My dad doesn't really have friends or other relatives. Hence, seeing his family after a long time, he got emotional, decided to forgive them, and started to be on speaking terms. In these five years, they got pretty close. I hated them from the bottom of my heart, but since we don't see each other often, this didn't affect me in any way. \r  \n\r  \nNow this is happening and I have told my mother a hundred times, how all of this is affecting me, her going out of her way to help my aunt (who refuses to ask Nina for help as she doesn't want to \"Disturb\" her). At the end of the day, I don't care who my mum chooses to help, BUT when she is not here, I have to do all the damn work and it is downright exhausting. I'm also struggling with BPD for a long time and whatever is happening in my home is making me extremely furious.\r  \n\r  \nI've had enough. For the past two days, I've stopped doing any work. I've stopped cleaning the home. I've stopped going to the market and cooking dinner. I just close my door and study. So, my mum had to come home, exhausted, and do these herself. I don't think she deserves it. But I have no other choice. AITA for refusing to help my mum?\r  \n\r  \nPS: I always help my mother with chores, we share the work.

Yes, it sucks that your mom has to do this all herself but she does need to understand that you are contributing and all the extra is not your responsibility.", "NTA, your dad and your brother are lazy if they want chores done then they can do chores, also, they expect you to wait on them hand and foot, you\u2019re not there F$@king servant, if they want something they can go up and get it themselves, stand your ground. This is a hill worth dying on, also tell your mom to join you in this little strike and tell her that she doesn\u2019t need to put up with this.", "Your dad and your brother expect you to wait on them hand and foot like you are staff?

When your mom is gone, tell the other household residents you will only be doing this and that (such as cooking twice a week and shopping once, plus do your own stuff - clean up after yourself, do your laundry, etc.) and they will have to take care of themselves.  It is your parents' home.  It does not sound like you pay rent or contribute to expenses, so you definitely should be doing something around the house even when they do not.  You are punishing your mom for the lack of effort of your brother and dad.  That is wrong.  As parents age they tend to bond over the same things and one of those is needing help.  We look at it as we help each other because none of us want to be without some help when we need it.", "NTA for quitting being your dad and sibling's maid.

I don't know if that's fixable.\n\nI once met an older man in my workplace from a country with this kind of culture -- while male/female coworkers would get coffee for each other to help each other out, he flat-out stated, \"It's women's work.\" Although everyone laughed and joked and said, \"No, it's not,\" trying to cut the tension, he VERY OBVIOUSLY considered it below him. Like his expression and tone were serious and condescending. He wouldn't do tasks if a woman told him, but he would if a man told him to. \n\nNo one really likes him. I don't know why he's still working here, tbh. I guess it's not sexual harassment or anything too obvious for HR.", "NTA it was really hard to execute, but my therapist and I worked on this recently - at some point you have to look at the person\u2019s choices as their own and accept them. She gets to decide that this aunt matters to her. Consider that she might be picturing her own future as an elderly widow and hoping like hell that someone will do this for her too.  She knows now how much it takes out of her and how much work will be left for her when she gets back home. It\u2019s up to her to decide whether she can afford to continue helping while not expecting assistance from the men in the household.\n\nI would consider whether you can get away with 1) talking to your cousin about helping her mother or 2) addressing your brother about his lack of contribution to the household or at least, asking less of your mom than he typically might.", "Sounds like the one you hate and punishing is your mom?
