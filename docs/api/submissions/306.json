I now take care of the room both me and my mom share any my side is very clean and I make sure to clean her mess as well just to be nice. I take care of myself and OUR room for her since she's barely home. And she doesn't even sleep in the room half the time. She sleeps in my sisters room because my sister is clingy.

But if there\u2019s any correct solution here it\u2019s that you and your sister share a room. Not that you get your own.", "YTA. In this situation you should be sharing with your sister, honestly. Your mother should have her own room.", "INFO: why do you feel you deserve your own room and not your mom? To me the most logical would be you and your sister sharing a room and your mom getting her own room.", "Yes YTA. By your own admission your mom is barely using the room anyways (barely home, sleeps in sister's room).\n\nYour mom is making the best of the situation it sounds like and you're complaining that you, 1/5th of the people in the house, don't get 1/3rd of the real estate. Don't you think your mom should get her own room?", "I mean, NTA for wanting your own room, but it also kind of sounds like you do, since you say your mom is barely home.  But also, what is your solution for how to get your own room in that house?  You can't just yell at your mom and make a whole other room magically appear, there's simply not enough space.  So what do you expect your mom to be able to do about it?", "ES. You should not be yelling at your mom. And she should not be blatantly ignoring you. I think you both need to come to a compromise. She needs to explain why you aren't responsible enough to have your own room. And if your sister is so clingy, she should sleep in the same room as your mom, and you get your own room back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Though I have to say if your mum is in your sisters room half the time it sounds like she is trying to give you space and share her sleeping arrangement between you.", "Me and her have a very Rocky relationship and this would very much make it worse so I'd rather not share with her but this definitely makes sense.", "I see your point thank you for your input :)", "It's not that I think I deserve it, it's that I know it would help my mental health Erich is currently very bad. Me and my mom are trying to have a relationship in general but it needs to be of our own want not cause we conviently share a space. She was very neglectful towards me for years and is just now putting in the effort. My mom does deserve her own space as well I completely agree. Me and my sister sharing a room is an idea I haven't thought about until you and a few others have shared so I'll definitely think about it and bring it up.", "I do for sure. She doesn't have enough time to take care of her own space which I wish she did then maybe we would get along better. I'm trying my best to make the situation as good as it can be but my therapist has even said that I'm in the right for wanting that space. The room I would get is the smallest out of all the rooms and it just makes the most sense for me to get it. or as one of the other users has said for my mom to get her own and me and my sister to share. I just really can't share with my mom.", "We originally lived in th house we did now and she shared with my sister. When we moved in that other house she shared a room/bed with my sister. I think we should go back to that since she ends up sleeping in her room half the time anyways. I understand that there's not space for all of us but it makes the most sense for her to just share with my sister! The room my mom and I share has enough room for two people but my sister also ends up staying in here when my mom is here so it's just crowded all the time.", "I don't like yelling at her at all and definitely regret doing so. She escalates our conversations a lot so I end up raising my voice. She's said I've become more responsible as well and she's been relying on me more! But she still ignores me. As for that last part I've brought that up very calmly and she ignored me.", "That is true the sleeping arrangement would be perfect if she wasn't so loud. She needs to watch something to get to sleep and I prefer it to be quiet. I've told her to turn it down but I have sensory issues and still hear it. Though I'm sure it could be fixed is she got headphones. It's more about the fact that it's not great for my mental health to be around her when she's back from work and both of us are drained. I will say that the next time I have a talk with her thank you.", "Sounds like you should work on improving your relationship with your sister to show you are responsible.  You sound very immature here.", "sorry soft YTA here, she is doing her best? Is she working? Are you working? Do grandparents work? \n\nYou might have legit reasons for not being in there and I'll change my judgement if you can show where mom has a 'fault' in this or else you will have to make the best of the situation.  I have seen nothing about dad so I guess not in the picture.  \n\nAlso does not from your wording sound like something from North American Culture so I'd be really leery about any further advice.", "I suspect that your mom may be spending time in your sister\u2019s room so that you have some privacy.  I also wonder if she wants you close to her so that she can continue to monitor your mental health.", "Welp, only one thing left to do. Get a job. See how she reacts when things aren't picked up. You can start saving money to move out when you turn 18.", "I can understand the yelling even if it normally doesn\u2019t help to solve things. For me it\u2019s when I feel I\u2019m not heard or understood or ignored that I tend to raise my voice. It\u2019s taken years of practice and trying to learn that I\u2019m ok even if people don\u2019t respond to what I\u2019m saying.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say AH for yelling.\n\nMaybe ask her what you would need to do for situation to change? Like what she practically would want you to accomplish to get your own room.\n\nI suppose I think your mom is a soft AH, which means I think you\u2019re NTA.", "Oh I see, yes that would make it difficult. Maybe the best option is your mum has the small room and you and your sister share the larger room, since it\u2019s likely to disturb your sister as well. Then if your sister is clingy and wants to be with your mum, she can go into the room with her and you will have quiet to sleep.", "I am definitely working on that and I will continue to do so thank you for you input!", "She is Definitely doing her best, she works and is the only one but my grandparents get their own money from their retirement. I'm going to start working this/next month. As soon as I do I'm going to pay for all the groceries as my form of rent. I believe she is at fault because she ignores me when she's told me that she'd start listening to me more. She doesn't even offer any explanation as to why she makes these decisions when she's promised she would. Also yes dad is not in the picture and it is to do with North American culture.", "She never asks about it and isn't home enough to actually do that. When she is she just watches TV and ignores me for the most part so I doubt that's the case. But she's not doing that for privacy she's just close to my sister.", "I'm doing so either this or next month (I can legally work I'm just working on a resume and trying to transfer schools from in person to online so I'm very busy.) I've started saving up and am very excited to move out.", "Sadly probably the best option.", "I will definitely bring it up thank you for your advice :)", "Is she telling you that you need to contribute financially, or are you choosing to do that?  It\u2019s always nice when kids help around the house, but you shouldn\u2019t feel as if you need to buy the family groceries.", "Or maybe share w your sister as some have suggested and if that\u2019s an option :)", "I choosing that since I know she would never ask and I want to help around since she's the only one with an income that's in the house right now. It'll be my form of rent at least when I feel stable :) we don't buy a lot"]}
