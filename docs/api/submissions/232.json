NTA.  Fuck that guy.", "NTA - Funerals are trying emotional times for everyone, and that includes you. If he can dish comments then that means he needs to be able to take comments. \n\nAlso, never apologize for cutting toxic people from your life even if they're related by blood. Life's short and haters goin' hate. Give them the deuces and don't look back.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You removed yourself from the drama. Your uncle seems very entitled and even a little jealous. He was childish making an issue at such a sad time for your family. This was about your grandmother, not him. They need to apologize or expect to be blocked and not talked to. You shouldn\u2019t surround yourself with jerks like that.", "NTA. He told you to eff off. You\u2019ve effed off. Mission accomplished, uncle.\n\n(But your post title and the final question are asking two different things - you may wish to clarify which you\u2019re asking.)"]}
