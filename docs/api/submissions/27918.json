This has been communicated to both of our families who have been respectful of this (as well as our other boundaries/rules) despite a little bit of grumbling about it from his side.\n\nLast weekend we were over at my in-laws house and I had just finished breastfeeding my daughter, so she was all sleepy. I kissed her forehead before settling her to nap on my chest. \n\nMy MIL noticed and immediately remarked on it in a super passive-aggressive manner: \"Oh, I'm *so* glad that we're able to kiss \\[baby\\] now! Did your pediatrician update the rules?\"\n\nI was super confused and asked her what she meant and that the pediatrician's recommendation hadn't changed. She then accused me of violating the rules by kissing my own baby. I told her that the recommendation was that no one besides myself and my husband kiss our daughter, and she argued and heavily implied that I was being dishonest because I'd previously said \"nobody can kiss the baby\" rather than \"nobody but husband and I can kiss the baby.\"\n\nShe went on and on about this until I snapped that it should've been obvious that the rules we told her regarding our baby were about what we would/wouldn't allow OTHER PEOPLE people to do. She called me a hypocrite so I got up and shut myself in the guest room while my daughter continued to nap on me.\n\nA little while later MIL came in and \"apologized,\" claiming it was a kneejerk reaction and she was just confused and upset. She said she understands now that the rule only applies to other people. She then asked me if I would avoid kissing my baby in front of her until she's allowed to do so as well, because it's upsetting to see me doing that and knowing that she can't.\n\nI told her I can understand that it's frustrating to have strong urge to kiss a baby and not be able to.

HSV can cause encephalitis and meningitis in infants (and immunosuppressed folks) which can kill them. HSV specifically is WHY doctors advise strangers don't kiss baby. Limiting the amount of people kissing reduces the risk.

She grew the baby in her womb for 9 months mother in law did not. You do realize you could be carrying bacteria from something without even realizing it. Science says babies don\u2019t have a very big immune system until around 8 months. Therefore they are HEAVILY susceptible to every know illness from the bacteria of others. Mom and dad are very unlikely to give their child an illness because they were created from them and are around them all the time. It\u2019s a boundary all parents set. Moms germs are different from other relative and peoples germs. Not to mention wouldn\u2019t you think breastfeeding her own child would make her sick. I mean it is coming from her own body. I had the same rule when my kids were born and you know what happened when my second child was just a month old, he got sick after my own mother kissed him after I told her not to!

A shusher (a white noise machine that mimics a human shush) is a lifesaver for fussy ones. Baby vibrators are also awesome soothers and they make a pad that can go under the crib sheet, to maintain safe sleep. Knowing their environment is safe and meets their needs is essential for healthy neurological and psychosocial development. \n\nCo-sleeping with the safe 7 ONLY.
