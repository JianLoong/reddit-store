I kissed her forehead before settling her to nap on my chest. \n\nMy MIL noticed and immediately remarked on it in a super passive-aggressive manner: \"Oh, I'm *so* glad that we're able to kiss \\[baby\\] now! Did your pediatrician update the rules?\"\n\nI was super confused and asked her what she meant and that the pediatrician's recommendation hadn't changed. She then accused me of violating the rules by kissing my own baby. I told her that the recommendation was that no one besides myself and my husband kiss our daughter, and she argued and heavily implied that I was being dishonest because I'd previously said \"nobody can kiss the baby\" rather than \"nobody but husband and I can kiss the baby.\"\n\nShe went on and on about this until I snapped that it should've been obvious that the rules we told her regarding our baby were about what we would/wouldn't allow OTHER PEOPLE people to do. She called me a hypocrite so I got up and shut myself in the guest room while my daughter continued to nap on me.\n\nA little while later MIL came in and \"apologized,\" claiming it was a kneejerk reaction and she was just confused and upset. She said she understands now that the rule only applies to other people. She then asked me if I would avoid kissing my baby in front of her until she's allowed to do so as well, because it's upsetting to see me doing that and knowing that she can't.\n\nI told her I can understand that it's frustrating to have strong urge to kiss a baby and not be able to.

Infants are at high risk of severe illness if they catch these from an adult. It's not as simple as \"germs\" some viruses and bacteria are specifically transmitted by certain physical acts, HSV being one associated with kissing. HSV can cause encephalitis and meningitis in infants (and immunosuppressed folks) which can kill them. HSV specifically is WHY doctors advise strangers don't kiss baby. Limiting the amount of people kissing reduces the risk. Plus HSV1 and HSV2 can both cause cold sores (much more common with HSV1 while HSV2 typically causes genital herpes but can be transmitted by oral sex to the mouth lol) in adults. Most adults would not typically disclose that they have herpes causing cold sores to others.
