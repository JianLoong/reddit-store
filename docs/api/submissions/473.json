While this is a crappy situation for you and it sucks, he isn\u2019t obligated to house you for less than he would other people. His circumstances have changed and he has to do what works for him. It sounds like he\u2019s been fairly nice through the whole thing ie: giving you notice and giving you a chance to continue renting if you could work it out. Your situation is terrible and it sounds like he gave you a place to stay with cheap rent as long as he could. I think you should be grateful for that. I\u2019m sure if he could continue to help you out, he would but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s financially feasible for him.", "NTA, I am in a very similar situation where a breakup has forced me out of my ex's house.  I went to my family house.  Which has been taken over by my brother and his children after my Dad died and my Mom is living with her boyfriend. I am sitting there and my brother tells me I should get stuff I need out of the bedroom because his son is coming.  I say, about that, I will let D have the room until summer when he is done with school.  Pretty fair.  Then I get well that's his room.  I said, this is my house, also.\nHe storms off.  I drive over to Mom and tell her she will be getting a call.  She was crying and he had already called.  Then I almost get into it with her boyfriend.  \n\nNow, I, my Mom and my brother are all on the deed.  I have been out of the house for 20+ years. Then I found out from my Mom that she has been paying the taxes, utilities and other bills over $600 per month and not receiving any form of rent for approximately 6 years.\n\nAnd, here I am staying at her boyfriend's when I have a house.  Like you I have health issues and I have to find low income housing.  And, that's difficult without some form of case worker.\n\nI really feel for you, man.  It seems like the people that are supposed to love you disappear in your time of need.  You get to know a lot about the people in your life during these times.\n\nI don't have the answer for you.  I am still looking for it.  I hope this helps by letting you know that there are others in similar situations.  Eventually, things will work out.\n\nTLDR; similar story to show op is not alone in these types of situations.", "Sorry but YTA. Your situation sucks but it doesn\u2019t excuse the way you\u2019re acting towards your brother.\n\nYour living situation relied on your brother providing an affordable place for you to live. You got to enjoy that for a bit but he isn\u2019t at all obligated to continue such a situation. You\u2019re 21 years old - time to take care of yourself.", "YTA. You\u2019re in a shitty situation but your brother has no obligation to support subsidize your rent. He\u2019s given months of notice and that\u2019s the end of his obligation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
