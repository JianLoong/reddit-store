Damn near every single day I'm stuck watching Ann because she can't be left alone (history of mental institution stays) and refuses to go to school and/or gets kicked out of school. I'm pregnant and honestly, more irritable than I probably should be. \n\nBack a month ago our dog was hit by a truck and needed pelvis surgery. She is supposed to be kenneled for 8 weeks while she is healing. She is taken out of her kennel only to use the bathroom, per vets requests. But every single fucking time I turn my back, Ann has taken the dog out of the kennel and is either laying with her on the couch or getting her to \"play\". The dog of course does try to play but it doesn't take long for her to be in pain. I've told Ann way too many times to stop taking the dog out of the kennel and to leave the dog alone. \n\nYesterday I woke up pissed off because Ann didn't go to school, per usual, and I'm not even asked to watch this kid anymore. Jess just leaves her here while she goes to work. So I'm already pissed when I walk in to the living room and find Ann on the floor with the dog out of the kennel and trying to play with her. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at her to get the hell away from the dog and told her that if she so much as goes near her one more time than she will be the reason her and her mother need to find somewhere else to go. She started snapping about me being \"inhumane and neglectful\" of the dog because I leave her kenneled all the time and she said she was going to call Animal Control. I said \"please fucking do. Get the fuck out.\" She takes off. My husband is on my side mostly, except telling his niece to leave, but he's pissed because his niece did call animal control. My SIL is pissed and won't speak to me but told my husband I'm \"fucking psycho\" for speaking to a child like that.", "created_utc": 1685979751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141ilhb/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husbands_neices_for_not/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They need to go. Period. Like now. Or if you want to be really generous tell them they\u2019ve got until the end of the week. Let hubby know this is a deal breaker.", "NTA\n\nMaybe I've read too much bad fiction, but a 14yo who will go so far as to make a retaliatory call to animal control because she doesn't like a particular rule or boundary is a 14yo who is totally capable of calling CPS after baby comes and she doesn't like whatever new household rules are in place surrounding baby. She needs to go.", "NTA.  I strongly suggest your relatives have outstayed their welcome.  If you cannot protect your injured dog from them then it's time they found new arrangements.", "NTA\n\n1)  The dog is in pain after an op and is meant to be on crate rest to allow her to recover - Ann is ignoring that so the dog could end up with complications.\n\n2) If the dog snaps or bites due to being \"played\" with when she is in pain it will be SIL demanding the dangerous dog is killed (yes, killed, not put down because sometimes using the reality word is the only way to get through to people).\n\nDid Animal Control come out?  If they did hopefully they pointed all this out to the spoiled brat and your SIL.\n\nOh - and in case anyone says you should not scream at the child - too bad!  She and her mother have taken no notice of the calm approach and your dog's mobility and possibly life are being affected by their behaviour so it gets to the stage of being dramatic to get through to them.  Hope the dog recovers.", "NTA. 14 is old enough to understand that a post-surgical dog needs time to heal. You are defending your dog from harm. It really is as simple as that.\n\nWhere is your SIL in all this? At work?  That's no excuse for not parenting her child.\n\nI'm with you...it's a lot, especially being pregnant. Really glad your husband is behind you and the dog on this.", "NTA.     She is actively causing the dog to be reinjured.", "NTA 14 is old enough to understand basic rules and is clearly to spoiled or stupid to do so. I'd be throwing them both out so your poor pupper can heal in peace without the brat tormenting her", "Woah! I am curious to know what did the animal control say? And tell your SIL she should not leave her kid with a \u2018fucking psycho\u2019!", "NTA, she's 14 years old and can't listen to basic rules and instructions, I probably would've snapped way sooner. You have enough on your plate with the dog and pregnancy alone. Honestly, I'd throw the kid and the mom out.", "NTA. They would\u2019ve been booted out of my house unceremoniously the second time the teenager opened the dog\u2019s crate. The first time is understandable if she didn\u2019t realize WHY the dog was crated but she should not have needed to be told twice. My dog was on crate rest for four months after her first knee surgery and three months after the second one. Keeping still and calm while bones are healing is crucial. I hope your pupper is ok!", "Your SIL is mad at you because you yelled at the child, but that \"child\" has absolutely disregarded your rules, the welfare of the animal, the grace you gave her and her mother, and even had the audacity to report you to animal control. After that behavior I would tell them to move out. It's very kind of you that you haven't already. A 14-year-old is no longer a child, it is a teenager who is able to understand her behavior and its consequences. NTA", "NTA.  Why does Jess have to live with you?  Money issues?  If Jess can afford her own place, give her a date by which to move out.  If she is short on money, maybe you can contribute the delta to get her to move out, but include a timeline (e.g., six months of assistance).  You do not need this hassle while being pregnant, and for damn sure after your baby is born.", "NTA. You told her again and again, she\u2019s 14 not 4. She is not an unintelligent child. She knows what havoc she\u2019s causing.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s baiting you til the end of your rope. And it\u2019s insane that SIL is upset at you rather than begging for your forgiveness for her daughters transgressions. They are your GUESTS bc of the kindness of you & your husband.\n\nIt\u2019s blowing my mind they are both being so disrespectful & entitled when you can both so easily kick them out of your house bc of their actions.", "I mean maybe you could have handled it differently but I'm going with NTA.\n\nYour SIL is acting entitled. This kid should be in school and if she cannot be in school due to mental illness then her mother should be advocating for her to get help. Leaving her alone with a pregnant woman and her recovering dog from what it sounds like daily isn't the answer. \n\nHonestly if you've told this 14 year old over and over to leave the dog alone and she isn't listening to you, then your reaction is justified IMO. Maybe telling her to get out was too far but you do have a job to protect your dog. She's hurting your dogs healing and the fact she doesn't understand the dog is in recovery and thus _playing with the dog is cruel_  then it goes to show she really isn't mentally well. 14 is beyond old enough to understand the dog needs rest.\n\nYou need to ask these people to leave before you have your baby. If your niece can't respect boundaries with a sick/recovering dog is she going to respect boundaries with your baby??? This is a disaster waiting to happen and if your husband doesn't see this get yourself, the dog and your baby out until they're gone. It would be horrible horrible horrible if something happened to your dog- but you won't live with yourself if something happens to your baby.", "NTA. How are they yours and your husband's responsibility? They can leave if they don't like it.", "Like mother like daughter.  You were absolutely right to protect the dog under your care from somebody who doesn't care about its well-being.  People who don't listen to calm explantions often pay better attention to \"increased emphasis\"\n\nNTA", "NTA but this living situation is unworkable. Did you have a say in your sil moving in? What is the timeline for them leaving?", "NTA.  The child needs to respect boundaries, but it sounds like your SO also needs to set some with your SIL too.  You are not built in childcare. For her to assume you are is the height of entitlement and probably one of the reasons why she is newly single.  Screaming may have been a little overreactive, but given the situation and history of behavior of the child, it may have been the only way to reach her.  Sounds like they need to find other accommodations........", "NTA - your sister is though for letting this child go for so long without repercussions. Someone should have yelled at her like that a long time ago.", "Hmm, if in the us. You might be able yo get rid of her. Family property or not. \n\nAs if right now, you are the legal tenants, and it sounds like MIL can not make a choice if she is allowed to stay or not. \n\nI would discuss with a lawyer about eviction because she has no legal reason to be there when the legal tenants family or not say no. \n\nIf mil is not mentally able to make that choice then until power of attorney is turned to you, or her death and will read you have the legal rights here and dil can be kicked off property and evicted.", "No tell your sister-in-law if the dog has to go back in to surgery because of her daughter you will sue her", "NTA. Put a lock on the kennel.  Get rid of the family before your baby is born as it will only get worse.  Good luck!", "ESH. You are 100% right but you crossed a line threatening a 14 year old with homelessness...thats a threat that should be delivered in writing to SIL in w/e eviction notice your jurisdiction requires cause this is insane. \n\nAnn needs more help than y'all can provide. Ann needs to be in school. Ann needs to learn to listen. Ann needs to learn society will not spring to her defense when she is 100% wrong. These are all things SIL needs to be the primary on and that she isn't means you and husband need to really talk about the danger/risk/liability of Ann. Shes not just wrong, shes embolden in her wrong and SIL doesn't have the option of not speaking to you about Ann right now. SIL has to be the adult and make this sustainable, not you nor your hub.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
