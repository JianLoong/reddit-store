Kiddo was tolerating oral antibiotics pretty well and hadn\u2019t lost any of his energy so we weren\u2019t too concerned \n\nYesterday was my fianc\u00e9s stag do, he doesn\u2019t go out much and some of his friends don\u2019t live local so it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s a had night out with his best friends \n\nKiddo was a bit worse for wear yesterday I noticed he wasn\u2019t really peeing so kept an eye on it and documented everything including weighing nappies but didn\u2019t want to bother FH didn\u2019t think it was anything calpol  and extra fluids couldn\u2019t fix, then he started vomiting heavily not keeping fluids down \n\nSo I called NHS 111 for advice who advised us to get checked urgently and booked us at an out of hours GP service , as he\u2019d passed some urine and was taking fluids they weren\u2019t concerned and said to monitor at home \n\nI didn\u2019t end up telling fianc\u00e9 until midnight last night where he immediately started getting upset I hadn\u2019t told him, he felt guilty for not being here for us, felt guilty he was drunk so couldn\u2019t drive home, and in his words felt like a bad dad for not being here if it had ended up being more serious\n\nFuture father in law was out with him and had been told by MIL he\u2019d been sick but neither really knew the full extent\n\nI just didnt want him to feel he had to cut his night short or be up checking texts for instant updates and not enjoying himself, he really does deserve a night off and if we\u2019d had to go back to hospital of course I would have told him\n\nAITA\n\nEdit for clarification \n\nThursday we both took him to the hospital for the infection but had to go home as no beds kiddo was tolerating medicine and seemed himself on the Friday where we both took care of him \n\nSaturday he got worse whilst my partner was already out and drinking, so we got an appointment at an out of Horus GP\n\nEdit 2 timeline \n\nThursday me and fianc\u00e9 both took toddler to the hospital and sent home as no beds \n\nFriday: \n\nToddler was doing well tolerating oral antibiotics full of energy me and fianc\u00e9 were both together looking after him \n\nSaturday morning: \n\nToddler slept well and still full of energy, fianc\u00e9 left for stag do \n\nSaturday midday i noticed he wasn\u2019t peeing a lot and was a bit grouchier so kept a close eye gave calpol and extra fluids \n\nSaturday 6pm toddler began vomiting heavily \n\nSaturday 6:45pm second bout of violent vomiting still not a lot of urine. Called nhs 111 for advice \n\nSaturday 10pm home and in bed after going to out of hours GP \n\nSaturday 11pm still vomiting \n\nMidnight same day \n\nFianc\u00e9 text me on his way to the hotel, he had had enough on the night out and was heading back to sleep \nHis night was over and as we were chatting I told him about the evening we\u2019ve had \n\nReassured him he was ok fianc\u00e9 felt guilty for not being there \n\nSunday morning (today): fianc\u00e9 returned home ", "created_utc": 1697979716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dsrvu/aita_for_not_telling_fianc\u00e9_our_son_was_unwell/", "score": 1541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your partner are learning the boundaries of parenting.  You didn't want to bother him until you knew the extent of the illness.  Once you knew you called. \n\n In your mind your were saving him from worrying when there was nothing he could do that you hadn't already taken care of. In his mind, he feels left out of a situation that he feels he needs to be involved in. \n\nNow you know.  Next time, notify him asap.  Just move forward, the first baby is uncharted territory and parents have to figure out a lot of things through experience.  Sometimes you get it wrong.", "YTA\n\nsorry, I understand you didn't want to spoil his Stag, but this is his child too. You should have told him so he at least had a choice to come back before getting drunk.\n\nIf this was the other way round you would be having a hairy fit!", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think better communication could've been helpful but it was kind of you to take into consideration his night out. It's understandable why he feels the way he does and its valid. You tried to do what you thought was the right thing in the moment. Nobody is at fault but since this was such a severe incident he probably should've been told earlier. Hope your kid is okay now.", "NAH. You did everything right regarding kiddo, and if 6 pints in, dad *may* have done something stupid in order to get home quick to you. On the other hand, a text saying \"called 111, got an appt with out of hours, will keep u updated/update: kiddo is OK, please don't worry too much\" or something? \n\nDespite the flack it gets, 111 has always been great for me (and my kiddos)", "NAH. Use it as an opportunity to discuss how emergencies are handled in the future. \n\nAnd please take a step back to realize how awesome your relationship is! I think it's beautiful that you are both trying to put the other's needs first. In a world where many relationships have at least one partner who is all about their own needs, you were both trying to be the best you could for the other.", "soft YTA. \n\nYou didn't do it with bad intentions (like, for the sake of withholding info from the dad), you wanted to make sure he had a good time while you handled the situation. But, because he is the other parent, you should have notified him while telling him \"this is a unique night for you, I don't want you to feel like you have to choose between having your stag or going to the hospital with me, I got things handled fine here\" and let him make his own decisions. After all, if he decides that his son's health is more important, who are you to decide otherwise. \n\nThis is parenting philosophy that should have discussed beforehand BUT it's impossible to think of all possible parenting scenarios and come up with a solution for them in advance. I get that you were trying to make the best decision for both of you, but it just wasn't the best one.\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say.", "NAH\u2014 you\u2019re still getting to know each other as parents, really. Some dads, I\u2019m not saying the best dads, would be angry to get that call and frequent updates. Now you know.", "Gentle YTA. \n\nYou admit you would have been livid if your husband had made the same choice.\n\nTexting and checking in would have given him the option of getting home sooner or slowing down or whatever he wanted to do. It would have meant if things had in fact gotten worse he not only would have been in a more ready place in the moment but he also would be in a better place after the night. He\u2019s already feeling guilt for not being there. Can you imagine how he would have felt if he was partying while his kid took a turn?\n\nIt\u2019s so easy when someone is the caregiver to try and \u201cprotect\u201d the other parent and handle things alone. However, it\u2019s important to not only remember you are part of a team but that the other person *wants* to be part of the team - they want to be there to support you and the child you have together.\n\nParenting is hard enough. Don\u2019t carry unnecessary burdens,\n\nI\u2019m so glad your kiddo is okay.", "NAH - you meant well and had it under control. I personally would have wanted to know, but I think many others would have appreciated you just handling it. Especially when it was just monitoring and he was out at a special event.\n\nNot knowing your friend group/partner/etc - I think the reactions to you calling could have ranged from \u201cI\u2019ll drop everything to join you\u201d to \u201cmy partner is insane and won\u2019t give me even a few hours alone\u201d\n\nNow you know how you as a couple will want to handle stuff like this in the future.", "[deleted]", "NAH", "NAH. He's not wrong for feeling that way but you were capable of handling the situation and did so. There was nothing more he could have done had he come home early. You were trying to be considerate of him. None of you are AHs.", "NAH. Emergency department and full on hospital admittance are reasons to interrupt the other parent's events. Visits to an urgent care are not.", "NAH. It didn't really make sense or had any benefice to anyone to inform him and ruin his night if he wouldn't have been able to come and help anyway and you son was never in any real danger. Your fianc\u00e9 is understandably upset to learn his kid was very sick while he was out partying.\n\nIt's worth taking notes for handling things better in the future, but that's not something that deserves beating yourself up about either.", "NAH, there was nothing he could have done, he was already out drinking and kiddo was taken care of. If he'd said in advance to call him in if anything happened or if you'd texted him you could have avoided the whole thing, but I get why everyone did what they did. Better communication will help both of you going forward. I hope your little is doing better!", "Well it all depends on what you promised each other. \nWhen we have had our daughter sick wile my husband was out of town with friends (once in a couple of years) we spoke about what we would do of she got worse. \n\nBecause I had the same intent as you had and wanted him to have a good time I didn't want to bother him at all. Because what would he be able to do on such a distance and feeling worried while he should have fun. \nHe wanted to be updated but promised me it would be ok for him to know how we are doing but not let it ruin his good time. \n\nSo in the end we had to see a gp as well, just to make sure that is was really just a flare up. We updated him and his friends were there to talk to him and reassure him. After we left we updated again and he was able to have a better time then expected because he knew we were ok and taken care of.", "Eh, I don\u2019t think this is a situation where you\u2019re being an asshole. You\u2019re an adult who weighed the situation as best as possible in the moment. \n\nYou took care of your kid\u2019s health in a responsible way. I imagine that was first priority on your mind. Then you weighed your husband\u2019s situation. There was no way he could help or provide support in the moment; and every health professional you saw said your son was relatively safe. Im sure if the situation was different, or if he had been getting worse, you would have made another decision, or pulled him in. \n\nYou delayed telling him by a matter of hours because he was already drinking. I have no clue how he would have handled it in the moment if you had told him. Maybe he could have processed the information well, maybe not. Your gut said \u201cdon\u2019t tell him yet\u201d.  It\u2019s the best you could do during a stressful night, and there\u2019s no changing it. Had he come home, there would be a drunk adult and a sick kid in the house and the situation is even more complicated. \n\nI understand that he feels guilty now, but he doesn\u2019t need to, and he should be told that. He had a trustworthy partner handling the situation. \n\nNo one needs to feel guilty in this situation, no one is an asshole. Everyone did well. Your son\u2019s on the mend. Everyone take the win.", "NTA you rang 111, went to an GP and they said not to worry. (And 111 is prone to overreact) \nIf it had escalated beyond that you\u2019d be an arsehole but at that point it\u2019s something you mention when he comes home. The y.t.a seem to be from people that don\u2019t understand 111 and GP aren\u2019t the same as hospitals.", "Yes, YTA, because you delayed telling your fiance the truth: his son wasn't well. The idea that he did/did not deserve a night out was irrelevant. How would you have felt if the roles were reversed?", "NTA, but it's understandable he's upset. He loves his son and wants to be there for him. Maybe, going forward, you two could agree on a policy to inform each other, but specify if it's a 'come home now' or an 'under control, will update you' situation. That way, the parent who is out knows what it's happening and whether they need to drop everything.", "(This is a different story, BUT) My husband works out of town 2 weeks at a time, and sometimes is on night shift, if something like this happened, and he was on nights, I'd likely wait until I know he's awake. Waking him and telling him wouldn't solve much, and he'd lose sleep, and sit and worry. So ya, I see where you're coming from, but I also see his side. I'm gonna say NTA, but I'd also explain why, and that next time you'll tell him right away.", "NTA. You knew your fianc\u00e9 was out drinking. This incident was not life-threatening, did not require a hospital visit, and did not need more than you in attendance.", "NAH. I understand why he would be upset you didn\u2019t tell him but I\u2019m not sure what benefit there would be to him coming home while drunk. If the little one had to go to hospital then that\u2019s another matter entirely.", "Soft YTA. Just apologize and learn from it. Sounds like you\u2019ve got a good man there.", "NAH I think, you were trying to do a nice thing and not worry your partner, but I would feel the same way he does. I've explained to my husband that if I can't trust him to tell me if something is going wrong at home, I'm not going to fully relax when I'm out. If I know he'll tell me, then I know everything genuinely is fine and I can enjoy some time out", "NAH - sometimes you have to trust one parent to handle a situation. Unless he asked to be notified for smaller, non dangerous situations, then Mom can handle it.", "NAH\n\nBut talk it through with him, because it WILL come up again, and you need to be on the same page about it.\n\nPut yourself in his shoes... If it had been you out, and you found out after the fact that kiddo had ALMOST had to head to the hospital and you hadn't known, you'd feel the same way he does. Any of us would.\n\nIn future I would recommend a text like\n\"NOT URGENT, at this point do not change plans, but I wanted to keep you in the loop...\" followed by the calling in an appointment just to *make sure*\n\"And I will update you with what the doctor says. I don't see any reason for you to come home or worry, but I didn't want to leave you out of the loop.\"\n\nI know that's a lot of words, maybe you guys can come up with a shorthand. \"FYI\" can just mean all of this.\n\"FYI/Stand by\" maybe means \"I'm worried, so stop drinking now in case this is urgent\"\n\"911\" means stop and pay attention, I need your support/presence/etc\n?", "Soft YTA. Your heart was in the right place but him not knowing his son had taken a turn for the worse is making him feel guilty.\n\nIf the positions were reversed and you'd been on your hen do, would you have wanted to know or not?", "A very gentle YTA. I understand not wanting to worry your partner. The fact that you didn't want him to cut his stag do short is very kind of you. A stag do is a big deal and it's nice that you wanted him to have a fun night. However, his child is a bigger deal that his stag do. I'm sure you'd want to know if your kid was receiving any kind of medical attention.\n\nI can also almost certainly guarantee that he was already worried about your son. If he was unwell enough that he almost got admitted to hospital then that would have still be on your fiancees mind. Giving him a heads up that you were taking kiddo to get checked out again wouldn't have added a huge amount of worry.", "Yta. His child. Not just yours.", "This exact same thing was posted yesterday. Why the repeat?", "WTF does FH mean?", "NTA.  You dealt with it.\n\nBut I am curious as to why you told him on the night of his stag do since the whole point was to let him enjoy the evening without worrying?", "NAH. I think what you two have discovered here is different tolerances for how severe kiddo's condition must be before notifications are called for to cut short special events. Probably FH would have agreed he didn't need to come home if kiddo had a minor stomach upset or the sniffles. Probably you both agree that FH should have come home if kiddo broke an arm. The current situation falls on one side of the line for you and on a different side of the line for FH. What you need to do now is have a conversation about your respective preferences for being notified about these sorts of emergent situations in the future: how bad does it need to be? \n\nYou don't need to compromise about this on either side.  If FH has stricter tolerances than you do, then you call him sooner than he would call you.", "Soft YTA. You didn\u2019t do anything in malice, you just wanted him to have a good night. Also, he knew the kid was sick and went out anyways (I\u2019m in no way shaming him at all). In the future I\u2019d probably send a \u201chey just so you know, kiddo is throwing up so we\u2019re gonna swing by urgent care\u201d just to keep him in the loop. Communication is so important in marriage and parenting especially", "NTA - You did it for the right reasons, don't beat yourself up about it", "NAH.\n\nI understand that you want to let your partner have some time off and didn't want to let him be concerned, take a load off his mind.\n\nThough, yes, you should had let him know as he is a parent of the child too. You should had reassured him you will be there with the child and not to worry. I'm sure he would had understand that your intent.", "NTA, you've stated you would have contacted him if he deteriorated, which is all he needs to know. Yes, he's his child too, but you were being thoughtful and considerate knowing there's little he could do. He couldn't magically make your child better, so being kept in the dark didn't hurt anyone. I'd have thought you were a one off fiancee, ensuring he has a good night rather than being sat in A&E. Most blokes would think their SO was trying to stop him having fun you did the opposite. Hopefully, your boy recovers well and it was a little scare xx", "I don't think there is any \"fault\" here. Don't know why people focus on fault instead of solutions. It's early years and I'm sure your intentions were good. Being in any relationship involves communication. Sometimes \"good intentions\" help pave the road to hell. Learn and move forward.", "YTA. It sounds like you have a really involved partner and you owed it to him to tell him. \"Hey, I think I have things under control but I wanted to let you know LO is sick. I don't want it to ruin your party but I did want to let you know. I'll keep you posted.\" Then you've given him the choice on how to proceed.", "YTA. Sorry, but you don't get to choose what a loving and present parent knows about their own child. Your intentions might've been well meaningful, but it's the outcome which matters. Your fianc\u00e8 has the right to make that call (stay or go) himself, rather than you deciding for him. Now, you have proven that he can't trust you with important information and honesty, which is not a great start even before you're married. You also robbed your son of the ability to have both parents present to comfort him, and he's too young to understand fully and is probably concerned that his Daddy isn't going to show up for him at his most vulnerable moments.\n\nPlease apologise and don't do this again. Yours and your son's relationship with his own father should not suffer because you opted to not provide honest information.", "NTA you did what you thought was best for your son and your fiance. \nIf your son would have been hospitalized you would have contacted his dad. \nLike you said your husband was already drinking to the point of being drunk, so what was he going to do for you or your son? \nNow that you are aware that this situation upset him you can do better in the future.\nI hope your son is feeling better.", "NAH. You had good intentions and didn't mean to upset him. You've said you'd have told him if it got worse. However, it's understandable why he'd feel bad about it.", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with a drunk and baby at the same time.", "NAH.\n\nIf he was drunk and unable to drive what is he going to even do? Sit there worried and ruin his night?\n\nIf it was the opposite way and you were at hens night and piss drunk would you be angry not to have been told, when there's literally nothing you can do, and you couldn't even get there?", "NAH. You wanted your future hubs to have a good time but you shouldn't have omitted this information. You should've called him up, told him you got it and he's to party on, no need is good news and promised to keep him updated.", "YTA \n\nYou are not *his* parent to choose what information he learns about his own son. I\u2019d be so pissed.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't know if this would escalate.  You should have let him make the decision (which would have been to stay with you).", "YTA. I get why you didn\u2019t feel like it was necessary for him to come home from his stag do, but you should have at least let him know what was happening and that you had it handled. Not communicating that my child needed to go to hospital would have made me very frustrated and upset.", "NAH, based on FIL also generally monitoring the situation, and making the same choice you did. He was already too drunk to leave or help you on his own when you took your son in, and if it had escalated any, his dad would have brought him to the hospital. He left knowing his son was having trouble the day before and everyone, including him, considered the situation manageable.", "I think that you are sweet for gifting your SO with a night with friends. Kiddos get sick, it is *rarely* life changing. My husband traveled for work, I dealt with everything. NTA", "Nta. I think you were kind to let him have the night out to see friends who\u2019d travelled for his stag do, and not make him feel bad about it. It\u2019s not like it was just an average night out with mates. There wasn\u2019t much he could do by then after all that drinking and the stag do isn\u2019t just an ordinary night. Lots of people seem to be overlooking the fact that you ur fianc\u00e9 knew your kiddo was really unwell and he chose to get really drunk but that\u2019s a key point in my view and on him, not you. He could have gone out but not drunk so he was on hand if needed. \n\nWhat would he have done if you\u2019d have been messaging with updates after 6 pints? It wouldn\u2019t have changed anything. Personally, as a mum of three kids I think you made a thoughtful call and your intentions were driven by kindness. 1. Kids are always getting sick with nasty illnesses and special life events pass by. 2. Children seem to turn much more quickly from being find to bring really ill than adults. As you say, you\u2019d have contacted him if he needed to go back to hospital which is the key thing. as long as you could manage it all, I think it was a tough call but the one I would have made.", "I don\u2019t understand how your partner didn\u2019t know hour child was unwell. Wasn\u2019t he part of the urgent care the night before? Wasn\u2019t he given the same info, that your son should\u2019ve be admitted?", "YTA. Your heart was in the right place, but your fh had the right to know and make his own decision. Even if he was 6 beers deep, he could have stopped drinking to lessen how incapacitated he became should the situation worsen.", "YTA\n\nI appreciate that you had your reasons.\n\nBut he's a dad, first and foremost. He would want to know if his child was sick.", "Soft ESH When you have a sick kid at home and one of the parents is going out, you talk beforehand. What would be done, what will happen if the kid gets worse and when do you call the other parent. Neither of you thought about it.", "NTA, no one is imo. \n\nIt\u2019s good to talk about how you both would like to handle these situations in the future though.", "I'm going with NAH. He was drunk enough he would have been in the way of he left his party, and you had things under control. I can see why he was upset, because I know he feels guilty that he was too drunk for you to want to call him. \n\nThis is a good opportunity to figure out a system for the future. Since it doesn't sound like FH typically drinks this heavy, it doesn't sound like it'll be much of a problem.", "A bit YTA, you should've give him the chance to choose to stay with his child.", "FH?\n\n(All these damn letter combinations all the time.)", "I see the balancing act you pulled there. You let your man have time with his mates and you took care of your kid's illness at the hospital.\n\nBut, YTA here. It is always best for parents to share those serious situations together.", "YTA. Thats also his kid, if your son was that bad, he HAS to be aware, what if your kid had the worst case scenario?", "YTA\n\nYou denied your child access to a parent during a crisis. You denied a parent access to their child during a crisis. You made it clear that you think your partner cares more about socializing than their child. Dude. What the fuck?", "NAH.\n\nYou were acting in consideration for his night. However, he did have a right to know that his baby wasn\u2019t doing well. It sounds like you chose the right person.\n\nHe would\u2019ve been too drunk to do anything, and it would have ruined his night. However, he would have wanted to know.", "NTA. You had it handled. Assure your fiance that you will always tell him if you feel you need help, but you didn\u2019t need to this time.", "YTA\n\nI can imagine your response if the shoe was the other foot.\n\nYou would be livid.", "YTA had this been roles reversed you'd be a lil pissed too", "Yes. YTA.", "Soft YTA. I don\u2019t think your actions were malicious and you seem to have handled the situation on your own. But I think you handled it poorly. Your soon to be husband should be involved and I would actually say his reaction is good.\n\nMaybe have a serious conversation on how to deal with situations like this in the future. Are there certain steps to take to notify the other person (IE: call or text), what if someone is traveling for work, what type of situation warrants tripping these steps, etc.", "NTA. I'm a parent of four. You were taking care of the problem! This was not something that had to be relayed right away. Your child wasn't in danger because you were monitoring and talking with all the right people and took him to GP to make sure there wasn't something more that needed to be done.", "I'm sorry, but YTA. Yes, I get not wanting to interrupt your fianc\u00e9, but this isn't the sort of thing to keep to yourself. Marriage and parenting both require constant communication with your partner, even when there isn't an immediate fix. It can just be a quick text.\n\n\"Hey, I'm taking the baby to the doctor. I've got it covered. You do NOT need to come home. I promise to call if we need anything.\" \n\nBoom. Done. He is an adult, and that lets him make his own choices. It keeps him informed without making him leave. It gives him time to stop drinking in case there is an issue that will need to be handled. Doing it your way, you tried to protect him, but you didn't give him the chance to make choices for himself. That isn't the way to treat a partner.", "YTA. You would have been mad if he didn\u2019t tell you, and that is definitely the kind of thing you tell your partner! They get to make the decision about what their plans will be going forward, you took away his chance to be there for his child and that sucks. Your intentions were to be nice, but you were controlling and lied to your partner.", "YTA - You had good intentions, however he should know what is happening with his child\n\nYou even admitted yourself in a comment you'd be angry if it was the other way round", "YTA Your child was seriously ill and you decided not to tell his father. None of your excuses matter. You were wrong.", "NTA I think you did the right thing. You essentially took him to what in the US is called an urgent care. You weren\u2019t hiding anything and if it had been more serious I am sure you would have told him. But what was a drunk fianc\u00e9 going to do in that situation?
