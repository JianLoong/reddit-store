She's dealing with a lot right now, she's overwhelmed. She's basically having an identity crisis (been there, for the same core reason\u2014adoption).

Lying to her rather than telling age appropriate truths set her up to not be able to trust anyone in the future and made it harder for her to trust her own memories.  She was *somewhere* before she was five. Her history matters. \n\nTelling her that her mother didn\u2019t want her reflects on her on two ways.

Unfortunately, you handled this poorly from start to finish. Psychologists recommend telling children the truth about their adoptions in age appropriate ways from the beginning. Your daughter is in a lot of pain right now and she's lashing out at you, and your responses are feeding into the cycle.

It sounds like the religion took her and gave her to you to adopt. Which is literally ripping her away. \n\nYou mention that the truth isn't that her mom gave her away because she didn't want her. So her mom did want her? And who didn't allow her to keep Elsie? The religion? Religion itself doesn't take a child away. It was SOMEONE and she ended up with you?

Did the state do it?  Did the mother volunteer to terminate her parental rights?  Did you kidnap this child?

Not because you told her the truth, but because you initially lied to her and then told her the truth all those years later. I was adopted and can absolutely understand why she is so upset. Her whole entire perspective has drastically shifted and it\u2019s all because you finally decided to essentially come clean. I can tell by several statements in your post that you really didn\u2019t educate yourself very much on adoption. I recommend doing so now, at the very least.
