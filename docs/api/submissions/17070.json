I wanted to find a part-time job since I saw how exhausted he was every day, but he told me to focus on school instead. Meanwhile, Sam lived with his heart surgeon dad in a 5000 square foot mansion with a pool and a private movie theater. I won't lie, it did hurt sometimes to see Sam living life on easy mode while my dad and I struggled.

Im planning to work part-time, complete my requirements at community college, and finish my degree at a 4-year school. Meanwhile, Sam took private piano lessons and had a family friend who arranged for him to work in her university research lab over the summers. He even helped publish a scientific paper. Sam knew since the 7th or 8th grade that he wanted to follow his dad\u2019s footsteps and attend an Ivy League school. Sure, Sam had legacy and connections, but he's also genuinely the hardest-working and smartest person I know.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday. Sam invited me and 2 other friends (Amy and Elaine) to his house. He showed us some of the cool stuff that his college sent him before we all went to hang out by the pool. Unsurprisingly, the conversation soon turned towards college and future plans. Amy asked Sam what he wrote about in his college essay. Sam paused for half a second before saying that he mainly wrote about the struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.\n\nIt was just too much. We were hanging out in a multimillion dollar house with a pool in the backyard, a private movie theater upstairs, a grand piano in the living room, and two BMWs plus a Porsche in the garage. I said \"Sam, really? Do you have any fucking self-awareness at all? How can you even fucking say that you struggled when you know how fucking hard my dad and I have it?\" I then left because I was getting increasingly angry and didn't want to say something that I'd regret.\n\nI've been avoiding Sam at school all week because I'm honestly still upset at him, even though Amy and Elaine have said that Sam really wants to talk to me.", "created_utc": 1683905076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fo6e5/aita_for_how_i_reacted_when_my_friend_told_me/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His essay wasn\u2019t about you, it had nothing to do with you.", ">struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.\n\nYTA. You realize not all struggles are financial/material, right?", "YTA. Sam wrote about his experiences in a single-parent household; unless he wrote about financial hardship and poverty, I don't see any issue here.", "YTA - Sounds like Sam talked about the struggles of growing up with a single parent, and not all of those troubles are necessarily related to his economic status. Although he\u2019s in a really good financial situation, it\u2019s really presumptuous to assume that you know everything that\u2019s going on in his life behind closed doors. A good friend would be happy for Sam and not belittle him just because he doesn\u2019t face the same struggles as you. Have some humility and realize that money doesn\u2019t always equal happiness in life", "This is a complicated one. I have been in this situation. I was you and my friend was Sam. I understand how you feel and it\u2019s natural to feel this way. It\u2019s true Sam is privileged and has had a lot of help. You have been through a lot and have worked hard to make the best with what you had. \nWhat makes you the Asshole is that you\u2019re angry that your dad and you have had to work so hard for minimal return and you\u2019re taking it out on someone that has nothing to do with that. You said Sam is very hardworking. Clearly you\u2019ve been friends for so long for a reason. Go talk to your friend. Be honest, apologize, tell him you have been an asshole. Don\u2019t lose a good friend over jealousy. You\u2019re not a bad person. You just have to work on not misdirecting your anger.", "YTA. Do you even like Sam? It's clear you're jealous of him, but that doesn't mean you get to discount his experiences.\n\nOh, are you upset that your dad had to work a lot for a small apartment? Why are you complaining when there are people who don't even have a dad or a home! How dare you! \n\nYou see how dickish that is? Just because someone has it worse, doesn't mean you don't have problems. Stop comparing yourself to other people.", "YTA\u2026.just because he is lucky to have material items from his father, doesn\u2019t mean his struggles are any less important. Not having a mom can cause a lot of heartache and grief, which you of all people should understand. \n\nYour struggles because of your dad is not his fault and you need to get off your high horse. You even said Sam is genuinely one of the most hard working people you know. Doesn\u2019t seem like he slacked just because his dad has money and connections. Also, you don\u2019t know how Sam was feeling because heart surgeons work a lot! May be he also has a hard time because his dad is possibly away a lot. Material items and swimming pools and fancy cars aren\u2019t everything\u2026.a lot of times kids just want their parents.\n\nYou were rude and you should apologize. Stop being jealous.

(Using asshole lightly) \n\nSomething I try to do in life is NOT compare my struggles against other people. I.e just because I feel like my pain is worse, doesn't mean they aren't experiencing pain. \n\nAn extreme example of this is; I was sexually assaulted as a child in a bad bad way. If someone told me that they got their ass slapped at a Wal-Mart, I wouldn't be offended that they considered this significant. \n\nIt's our duty as friends to be sympathetic to other friends' struggles and not dismiss them if they aren't equal to ours.", "Info- did you actually read his essay, did he lie at all in it?", "YTA. He didn\u2019t say anything about struggling financially. Money can solve a lot of problems but grief isn\u2019t one of them. He still was a kid growing up without one of his parents. That brings all kinds of struggles, not just financial ones.", "Man, I feel all kinds of stuff reading what you wrote. In the span of 3 generations, my family had gone from riches to rags and (arguably) riches again. The downfall and hardships that befell my grandparents are indescribable. Things got a little easier, but the kind of stuff my parent's generation went through make my struggles look like child's play. And yet, I too can look at people like Sam and point out many ways in which I had things much harder. Everything is relative and the disparity can sometimes be mind-boggling.\n\nFrom that perspective, the whole college essay process is painfully disingenuous. Just think about how many rich people go to top schools, and the fact that all of them had to write about some kind of hardship they had overcome. I suggest not holding it too much against Sam. His hardship was, in an isolated sense, genuine, and he took advantage of that to write an effective college essay (just as we were all forced to). I would not be surprised if the process of writing his essay gave him some degree of cognitive dissonance as well; there is a somewhat ironic art in trying to spin a tale of hardship without coming off as tone-deaf to the plights of many who have it much worse.\n\nSo a soft YTA. I think understand how you feel, and I think I understand how Sam probably feels. And the whole education pipeline is far from equitable, and all we can do is push to make the system a little better.", "YTA I'm afraid. Just because Sam had money growing up doesn't mean he didn't struggle in different ways.\n\nI totally get that struggling for money can make having more of it seem like the answer to life's problems, but money doesn't solve everything. Sam still grew up without a mother, money or no money wouldn't change that.", "Yta. \n\nJust because someone lives in a big house doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have struggles too. You don\u2019t get to gatekeep on having a difficult life", "YTA and a jealous one at that. Stop trying to gatekeep a trouble childhood.", "YTA: those schools are looking for essays like that. If he wants to go, he has to write an essay that appeals to admissions. You are mad at the system and taking it out on your friend. \n\nYou owe your friend a huge apology.", "YTA. You are an absolute egoist. Because you don't know how other people live. He probably didn't want to tell you about what was happening to him and you thought he was fine. However, it is not.", "YTA. The essay wasn't based on \"Financial Struggles\". He wrote about his personal struggles. I know of well off friends who are struggling mentally and emotionally. I feel for them. Money doesn't always make you happy. You're a poor excuse for a friend. Friends support each other. And you basically felt the need to lash out because he's well off financially. I can clearly see that just because he has money he doesn't have a good friend in his corner.", "YTA \n\nYou actually mention Sam\u2019s lack of self awareness when you are showing it yourself. \n\nDude. He lost a parent. You know how that feels and what kind of impact it can have, so how tf can you not understand that was a struggle for him? \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t fix that, nothing does. If he wrote about overcoming poverty, then I could totally see you having an issue.", "YTA. Money can\u2019t just fix all of your problems. You don\u2019t ever know people\u2019s private struggles.", "And I had two parents but one of them was emotionally abusive and it would have been better to have just one, is this a competition?\n\nHe didn't write that essay to spite you and may not have even compared himself to others financially needing help in said essay. It's not really any of your business. YTA", "YTA. Losing a parent is hard whether you\u2019re rich or poor. Rich people have struggles as well. They may not be financial struggles, but there could be a million other struggles you know nothing about.", "YTA.\n\nAs a wise friend once told me, \"one person's struggles do not negate another person's struggles\".  Being well off certainly gave Sam privileges that you did not have, but that does not mean that he was without struggle. He lost his mom when he was young. No amount of money can make that better. And, with his dad being a surgeon, it may mean that he is not around a lot. Maybe his dad puts pressure on him to succeed, too. I am wondering if you even know his struggles because you were so caught up his wealth you never thought to ask.", "YTA- As someone who grew up in poverty, I see the resentment towards other people who had it \u201ceasier\u201d than me when I was younger in you. Sam was born into the situation by chance, he has privileges, but he still grew up with one less parent. People can be privileged in some ways and not in others. What matters is he a good person/good friend. Poverty is very traumatizing, even if you have loving parents who did their best, but you can\u2019t move through life with the weight and anger of that. It will be a process you need to work through. I think you should apologize to your friend and explain where you were coming from, again say sorry, and explain you have some stuff to work through and that you shouldn\u2019t have minimized their experience.", "YTA. Being rich does not equate to happiness, or even emotional stability. Yes, their physical needs are being met. But that doesn't mean their emotional needs are. You centered yourself and played oppression Olympics about who has it 'harder'. Pain is relative. Especially since yours was financially based, and Sam's was emotional. And based on the way most of this was written, it's coming across very much as you being jealous of Sam's life. It's easy to be jealous of how easy someone has it financially, but you can never know what goes on emotionally in private between someone and their family, or in Sam's case, the lack thereof one parent.  \n\n\nI think you should, if you can now or in the future, see a therapist about the trauma of the financial struggles you have faced with your father. It's clear it has had a huge effect on you, to the point you're starting to feel resentment towards those who are more fortunate. While I agree no one should really be struggling while others flourish to such a degree, it's not fair to lash out at your friend in this way when your real problem is with the economic issues at hand.", "Oppression Olympics is a bad look on anybody. \n\nI grew up poor. I hated seeing kids have things that I couldn\u2019t. I understand where you are coming from. Soft YTA, bc you\u2019re poverty is not your friends fault.\n\nAlso if his dad was a surgeon I bet he was gone a lot. And with no mom at home? That sounds pretty crappy too. Life is not a contest.", "YTA - You cannot buy the solutions to those struggles. His economic status means nothing. You were out of line, and grossly jealous, and may have ruined a friendship with somebody you've known a long time. \n\nApologize as best you can", "Stop being jealous of your friend. And don\u2019t gatekeep being a child with a single parent. Just because he is privileged, it doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t had his own hardships.\nYTA", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss but YTA. Being rich doenean he didn\u2019t have a hard time, it just means he had material comfort.", "YTA stop trying to compare how difficult your lives were it's not a competition", "INFO: exactly how much money would your dad have had to earn, how big of a house would he have needed to have, and what luxuries and privileges would he have had to have bought you for you to be absolutely ok with your mum dying? What\u2019s the price you put on her memory?\n\nBecause that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying here. I get that it\u2019s not your intention, but it is your outcome.\n\nTrust me, I get it. Growing up in poverty is gut wrenchingly difficult! Been there, done that. But not all hardship is financial, and personal trauma is not a competitive sport. \n\nYou\u2019re frustrated, and hurting, and maybe a little envious\u2026 and that\u2019s absolutely valid. But none of that is your friend\u2019s fault, and you have been TA to him in this instance. It\u2019s time to own that, apologise, and have a proper conversation with your friend. You might find that the grass is not as green as it seems on his side of the fence.\n\nYTA, but I think that comes from a place of the emotional immaturity that\u2019s natural for your age.", "YTA, he lost a parent", "YTA. Just because his family is wealthy, doesn't mean he lives a happy, loved life. His dad is a surgeon, he is probably never home. This kid probably had to raise himself or a nanny did, not his parent. Just because people have money doesn't mean their lives are any easier, they just have more things and different types of problems than those who don't.", "NAH.\n\nYou're a kid, and kids are dumb and emotional, and kids who have baggage from growing up in a poor single-parent household are especially emotional. I'm impressed that you walked away, honestly. \n\nSam *was* being wildly insensitive, imo. Even as a kid, I was very aware of how good and easy my life was compared to my poorer friends, and my life was nowhere near as privileged as Sam's. In his position, I would have avoided having that discussion in front of you. It sounds like he may have stopped to think about it but couldn't find a way out, which sucks.\n\nThat said, Sam *did* still suffer the lack of a mother. And having a surgeon for a dad probably meant being alone a lot. \n\nPain is not a competition, hon. Hardship isn't a contest. You can be extremely privileged and still feel the pain of a lack. \n\nYou need to apologize to Sam and explain that it was incredibly painful for you to hear that because you look at him and see a life that's better than anything you would even risk hoping for. Tell him that you've struggled to see him as someone like you because he has so much. Point out to him that it felt like he was lying to get ahead, because no one thinks of a kid in a mansion with published papers when they think \"single parent household.\" (eta: please don't tell him that like it's a fact, cause it's not. It's just how it came across to you because of your own situation.)\n\nYou also need to own up to him about the envy and resentment you're obviously feeling, and you need to acknowledge it to yourself. It's okay to be envious and it's okay to feel bitter, but Sam doesn't deserve you taking those feelings out on him. If you feel like you can't treat him normally right now while you work through this stuff, tell him that honestly. Tell him that you value his friendship and you don't want to hurt him or say things you can't take back when you *know* those things aren't even true, but that you've got too many feelings to deal with productively right now.\n\nBased on your financial situation, I'm guessing therapy is probably not an option for you, but I encourage you to look into any services your school system or locality might provide for mental health. \n\nThis post oozes pain, and I hope you're able to overcome it and look back on this version of yourself and feel proud of how far you've come. Chin up, kid.", "You reek of jealousy dude", "YTA, you invalidated his entire life experience because you were jealous of his stuff. That he still wants to speak to you is amazing to me. Are you sure you are his friend?", "YTA \n\nREAD THE ESSAY", "I think the comments on here are a little harsh. We\u2019re talking about two motherless children coming into adulthood. I encourage everyone to remember what you all were like as teenagers. And our brains are not even fully developed at the age of 18!!

I know it\u2019s hard to grow up with a single parent that work\u2019s multiple jobs from experience. What I don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking into consideration is that while you were left alone when your parent was working multiple jobs, Sam was likely left alone while his parent was working a high stress job with a lot of hours. Material Things are not the same as your parent physically being there. I\u2019d bet the two of you have a lot more to relate about with each other than you realize in this area. Losing a parent is always hard. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re rich or poor, have a large extended family or small, etc. It will always be hard. I understand your frustration because on the outside it very much looks like he has it easy, and I also think you should try and set that frustration aside in this situation. It\u2019s not your fault that your dad has to work multiple jobs to provide for you, and it is not Sam\u2019s fault that his dad is wealthy. Maybe try talking with your school counselor about how frustrated you feel in this situation, and then after that maybe you\u2019ll feel ready to talk to Sam.", "Pain and suffering are not competitions. Just because you struggled in a different way doesn't negate his struggles. Be a better friend. YTA. My best friend in high school had a single father with three children. They struggled to pay for a lot of things. They lived in a tiny house with only two bedrooms. Now my family wasn't rich but we were better off financially. So I would help out my friend all the time to pay for things so she wouldn't miss out. I help pay for her marching band trips, dance tickets, dresses, her lunch, her letterman jacket, and a bunch more things. Plus my mom and I would drive her to most school events. Her father and her were always grateful for the help and he would always try to pay pay us back. I guessing, but OP likely had a similar experience. Because who would stay friends with a jerk who just rubs his father's money in your face all the time. OP you probably got many opportunities to do something you could have never done because of your friends money.

We bonded because we both lost a parent when we were really young, but otherwise our backgrounds couldn\u2019t be any more different. My dad worked 60-70 hours a week to afford a 1-bedroom apartment in a good school district. I wanted to find a part-time job since I saw how exhausted he was every day, but he told me to focus on school instead. Meanwhile, Sam lived with his heart surgeon dad in a 5000 square foot mansion with a pool and a private movie theater. I won't lie, it did hurt sometimes to see Sam living life on easy mode while my dad and I struggled. This was especially true in spring 2020, when my dad was panicking about no longer being able to work while Sam was posting pool selfies.  \nUnfortunately, I never had the opportunity to do the extracurriculars that look good on college applications due to the cost. Im planning to work part-time, complete my requirements at community college, and finish my degree at a 4-year school. Meanwhile, Sam took private piano lessons and had a family friend who arranged for him to work in her university research lab over the summers. He even helped publish a scientific paper. Sam knew since the 7th or 8th grade that he wanted to follow his dad\u2019s footsteps and attend an Ivy League school. Sure, Sam had legacy and connections, but he's also genuinely the hardest-working and smartest person I know.  \nFast forward to last Sunday. Sam invited me and 2 other friends (Amy and Elaine) to his house. He showed us some of the cool stuff that his college sent him before we all went to hang out by the pool. Unsurprisingly, the conversation soon turned towards college and future plans. Amy asked Sam what he wrote about in his college essay. Sam paused for half a second before saying that he mainly wrote about the struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.  \nIt was just too much. We were hanging out in a multimillion dollar house with a pool in the backyard, a private movie theater upstairs, a grand piano in the living room, and two BMWs plus a Porsche in the garage. I said \"Sam, really? Do you have any fucking self-awareness at all? How can you even fucking say that you struggled when you know how fucking hard my dad and I have it?\" I then left because I was getting increasingly angry and didn't want to say something that I'd regret.   \nI've been avoiding Sam at school all week because I'm honestly still upset at him, even though Amy and Elaine have said that Sam really wants to talk to me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
