I wanted to find a part-time job since I saw how exhausted he was every day, but he told me to focus on school instead. Meanwhile, Sam lived with his heart surgeon dad in a 5000 square foot mansion with a pool and a private movie theater. I won't lie, it did hurt sometimes to see Sam living life on easy mode while my dad and I struggled.

Im planning to work part-time, complete my requirements at community college, and finish my degree at a 4-year school. Meanwhile, Sam took private piano lessons and had a family friend who arranged for him to work in her university research lab over the summers. He even helped publish a scientific paper. Sam knew since the 7th or 8th grade that he wanted to follow his dad\u2019s footsteps and attend an Ivy League school. Sure, Sam had legacy and connections, but he's also genuinely the hardest-working and smartest person I know.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday. Sam invited me and 2 other friends (Amy and Elaine) to his house. He showed us some of the cool stuff that his college sent him before we all went to hang out by the pool. Unsurprisingly, the conversation soon turned towards college and future plans. Amy asked Sam what he wrote about in his college essay. Sam paused for half a second before saying that he mainly wrote about the struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.\n\nIt was just too much. We were hanging out in a multimillion dollar house with a pool in the backyard, a private movie theater upstairs, a grand piano in the living room, and two BMWs plus a Porsche in the garage. I said \"Sam, really? Do you have any fucking self-awareness at all? How can you even fucking say that you struggled when you know how fucking hard my dad and I have it?\" I then left because I was getting increasingly angry and didn't want to say something that I'd regret.\n\nI've been avoiding Sam at school all week because I'm honestly still upset at him, even though Amy and Elaine have said that Sam really wants to talk to me.", "created_utc": 1683905076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fo6e5/aita_for_how_i_reacted_when_my_friend_told_me/", "score": 1405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His essay wasn\u2019t about you, it had nothing to do with you.", ">struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.\n\nYTA. You realize not all struggles are financial/material, right?", "YTA. Sam wrote about his experiences in a single-parent household; unless he wrote about financial hardship and poverty, I don't see any issue here.", "YTA - Sounds like Sam talked about the struggles of growing up with a single parent, and not all of those troubles are necessarily related to his economic status. Although he\u2019s in a really good financial situation, it\u2019s really presumptuous to assume that you know everything that\u2019s going on in his life behind closed doors. A good friend would be happy for Sam and not belittle him just because he doesn\u2019t face the same struggles as you. Have some humility and realize that money doesn\u2019t always equal happiness in life", "This is a complicated one. I have been in this situation. I was you and my friend was Sam. I understand how you feel and it\u2019s natural to feel this way. It\u2019s true Sam is privileged and has had a lot of help. You have been through a lot and have worked hard to make the best with what you had. \nWhat makes you the Asshole is that you\u2019re angry that your dad and you have had to work so hard for minimal return and you\u2019re taking it out on someone that has nothing to do with that. You said Sam is very hardworking. Clearly you\u2019ve been friends for so long for a reason. Go talk to your friend. Be honest, apologize, tell him you have been an asshole. Don\u2019t lose a good friend over jealousy. You\u2019re not a bad person. You just have to work on not misdirecting your anger.", "YTA. Do you even like Sam? It's clear you're jealous of him, but that doesn't mean you get to discount his experiences.\n\nOh, are you upset that your dad had to work a lot for a small apartment? Why are you complaining when there are people who don't even have a dad or a home! How dare you! \n\nYou see how dickish that is? Just because someone has it worse, doesn't mean you don't have problems. Stop comparing yourself to other people.", "YTA\u2026.just because he is lucky to have material items from his father, doesn\u2019t mean his struggles are any less important. Not having a mom can cause a lot of heartache and grief, which you of all people should understand. \n\nYour struggles because of your dad is not his fault and you need to get off your high horse. You even said Sam is genuinely one of the most hard working people you know. Doesn\u2019t seem like he slacked just because his dad has money and connections. Also, you don\u2019t know how Sam was feeling because heart surgeons work a lot! May be he also has a hard time because his dad is possibly away a lot. Material items and swimming pools and fancy cars aren\u2019t everything\u2026.a lot of times kids just want their parents.\n\nYou were rude and you should apologize. Stop being jealous. It\u2019s not a competition on who has the worst \u201cstruggles.\u201d", "Yeah, you're the asshole. (Using asshole lightly) \n\nSomething I try to do in life is NOT compare my struggles against other people. I.e just because I feel like my pain is worse, doesn't mean they aren't experiencing pain. \n\nAn extreme example of this is; I was sexually assaulted as a child in a bad bad way. If someone told me that they got their ass slapped at a Wal-Mart, I wouldn't be offended that they considered this significant. \n\nIt's our duty as friends to be sympathetic to other friends' struggles and not dismiss them if they aren't equal to ours.", "Info- did you actually read his essay, did he lie at all in it?", "YTA. He didn\u2019t say anything about struggling financially. Money can solve a lot of problems but grief isn\u2019t one of them. He still was a kid growing up without one of his parents. That brings all kinds of struggles, not just financial ones.", "Man, I feel all kinds of stuff reading what you wrote. In the span of 3 generations, my family had gone from riches to rags and (arguably) riches again. The downfall and hardships that befell my grandparents are indescribable. Things got a little easier, but the kind of stuff my parent's generation went through make my struggles look like child's play. And yet, I too can look at people like Sam and point out many ways in which I had things much harder. Everything is relative and the disparity can sometimes be mind-boggling.\n\nFrom that perspective, the whole college essay process is painfully disingenuous. Just think about how many rich people go to top schools, and the fact that all of them had to write about some kind of hardship they had overcome. I suggest not holding it too much against Sam. His hardship was, in an isolated sense, genuine, and he took advantage of that to write an effective college essay (just as we were all forced to). I would not be surprised if the process of writing his essay gave him some degree of cognitive dissonance as well; there is a somewhat ironic art in trying to spin a tale of hardship without coming off as tone-deaf to the plights of many who have it much worse.\n\nSo a soft YTA. I think understand how you feel, and I think I understand how Sam probably feels. And the whole education pipeline is far from equitable, and all we can do is push to make the system a little better.", "YTA I'm afraid. Just because Sam had money growing up doesn't mean he didn't struggle in different ways.\n\nI totally get that struggling for money can make having more of it seem like the answer to life's problems, but money doesn't solve everything. Sam still grew up without a mother, money or no money wouldn't change that.", "Yta. \n\nJust because someone lives in a big house doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have struggles too. You don\u2019t get to gatekeep on having a difficult life", "YTA and a jealous one at that. Stop trying to gatekeep a trouble childhood.", "YTA: those schools are looking for essays like that. If he wants to go, he has to write an essay that appeals to admissions. You are mad at the system and taking it out on your friend. \n\nYou owe your friend a huge apology.", "YTA. You are an absolute egoist. Because you don't know how other people live. He probably didn't want to tell you about what was happening to him and you thought he was fine. However, it is not.", "YTA. The essay wasn't based on \"Financial Struggles\". He wrote about his personal struggles. I know of well off friends who are struggling mentally and emotionally. I feel for them. Money doesn't always make you happy. You're a poor excuse for a friend. Friends support each other. And you basically felt the need to lash out because he's well off financially. I can clearly see that just because he has money he doesn't have a good friend in his corner.", "YTA \n\nYou actually mention Sam\u2019s lack of self awareness when you are showing it yourself. \n\nDude. He lost a parent. You know how that feels and what kind of impact it can have, so how tf can you not understand that was a struggle for him? \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t fix that, nothing does. If he wrote about overcoming poverty, then I could totally see you having an issue.", "YTA. Money can\u2019t just fix all of your problems. You don\u2019t ever know people\u2019s private struggles.", "And I had two parents but one of them was emotionally abusive and it would have been better to have just one, is this a competition?\n\nHe didn't write that essay to spite you and may not have even compared himself to others financially needing help in said essay. It's not really any of your business. YTA", "YTA. Losing a parent is hard whether you\u2019re rich or poor. Rich people have struggles as well. They may not be financial struggles, but there could be a million other struggles you know nothing about.", "YTA.\n\nAs a wise friend once told me, \"one person's struggles do not negate another person's struggles\".  Being well off certainly gave Sam privileges that you did not have, but that does not mean that he was without struggle. He lost his mom when he was young. No amount of money can make that better. And, with his dad being a surgeon, it may mean that he is not around a lot. Maybe his dad puts pressure on him to succeed, too. I am wondering if you even know his struggles because you were so caught up his wealth you never thought to ask.", "YTA- As someone who grew up in poverty, I see the resentment towards other people who had it \u201ceasier\u201d than me when I was younger in you. Sam was born into the situation by chance, he has privileges, but he still grew up with one less parent. People can be privileged in some ways and not in others. What matters is he a good person/good friend. Poverty is very traumatizing, even if you have loving parents who did their best, but you can\u2019t move through life with the weight and anger of that. It will be a process you need to work through. I think you should apologize to your friend and explain where you were coming from, again say sorry, and explain you have some stuff to work through and that you shouldn\u2019t have minimized their experience.", "YTA. Being rich does not equate to happiness, or even emotional stability. Yes, their physical needs are being met. But that doesn't mean their emotional needs are. You centered yourself and played oppression Olympics about who has it 'harder'. Pain is relative. Especially since yours was financially based, and Sam's was emotional. And based on the way most of this was written, it's coming across very much as you being jealous of Sam's life. It's easy to be jealous of how easy someone has it financially, but you can never know what goes on emotionally in private between someone and their family, or in Sam's case, the lack thereof one parent.  \n\n\nI think you should, if you can now or in the future, see a therapist about the trauma of the financial struggles you have faced with your father. It's clear it has had a huge effect on you, to the point you're starting to feel resentment towards those who are more fortunate. While I agree no one should really be struggling while others flourish to such a degree, it's not fair to lash out at your friend in this way when your real problem is with the economic issues at hand.", "Oppression Olympics is a bad look on anybody. \n\nI grew up poor. I hated seeing kids have things that I couldn\u2019t. I understand where you are coming from. Soft YTA, bc you\u2019re poverty is not your friends fault.\n\nAlso if his dad was a surgeon I bet he was gone a lot. And with no mom at home? That sounds pretty crappy too. Life is not a contest.", "YTA - You cannot buy the solutions to those struggles. His economic status means nothing. You were out of line, and grossly jealous, and may have ruined a friendship with somebody you've known a long time. \n\nApologize as best you can", "Stop being jealous of your friend. And don\u2019t gatekeep being a child with a single parent. Just because he is privileged, it doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t had his own hardships.\nYTA", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss but YTA. Being rich doenean he didn\u2019t have a hard time, it just means he had material comfort.", "YTA stop trying to compare how difficult your lives were it's not a competition", "INFO: exactly how much money would your dad have had to earn, how big of a house would he have needed to have, and what luxuries and privileges would he have had to have bought you for you to be absolutely ok with your mum dying? What\u2019s the price you put on her memory?\n\nBecause that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying here. I get that it\u2019s not your intention, but it is your outcome.\n\nTrust me, I get it. Growing up in poverty is gut wrenchingly difficult! Been there, done that. But not all hardship is financial, and personal trauma is not a competitive sport. \n\nYou\u2019re frustrated, and hurting, and maybe a little envious\u2026 and that\u2019s absolutely valid. But none of that is your friend\u2019s fault, and you have been TA to him in this instance. It\u2019s time to own that, apologise, and have a proper conversation with your friend. You might find that the grass is not as green as it seems on his side of the fence.\n\nYTA, but I think that comes from a place of the emotional immaturity that\u2019s natural for your age.", "YTA, he lost a parent", "YTA. Just because his family is wealthy, doesn't mean he lives a happy, loved life. His dad is a surgeon, he is probably never home. This kid probably had to raise himself or a nanny did, not his parent. Just because people have money doesn't mean their lives are any easier, they just have more things and different types of problems than those who don't.", "NAH.\n\nYou're a kid, and kids are dumb and emotional, and kids who have baggage from growing up in a poor single-parent household are especially emotional. I'm impressed that you walked away, honestly. \n\nSam *was* being wildly insensitive, imo. Even as a kid, I was very aware of how good and easy my life was compared to my poorer friends, and my life was nowhere near as privileged as Sam's. In his position, I would have avoided having that discussion in front of you. It sounds like he may have stopped to think about it but couldn't find a way out, which sucks.\n\nThat said, Sam *did* still suffer the lack of a mother. And having a surgeon for a dad probably meant being alone a lot. \n\nPain is not a competition, hon. Hardship isn't a contest. You can be extremely privileged and still feel the pain of a lack. \n\nYou need to apologize to Sam and explain that it was incredibly painful for you to hear that because you look at him and see a life that's better than anything you would even risk hoping for. Tell him that you've struggled to see him as someone like you because he has so much. Point out to him that it felt like he was lying to get ahead, because no one thinks of a kid in a mansion with published papers when they think \"single parent household.\" (eta: please don't tell him that like it's a fact, cause it's not. It's just how it came across to you because of your own situation.)\n\nYou also need to own up to him about the envy and resentment you're obviously feeling, and you need to acknowledge it to yourself. It's okay to be envious and it's okay to feel bitter, but Sam doesn't deserve you taking those feelings out on him. If you feel like you can't treat him normally right now while you work through this stuff, tell him that honestly. Tell him that you value his friendship and you don't want to hurt him or say things you can't take back when you *know* those things aren't even true, but that you've got too many feelings to deal with productively right now.\n\nBased on your financial situation, I'm guessing therapy is probably not an option for you, but I encourage you to look into any services your school system or locality might provide for mental health. \n\nThis post oozes pain, and I hope you're able to overcome it and look back on this version of yourself and feel proud of how far you've come. Chin up, kid.", "You reek of jealousy dude", "YTA, you invalidated his entire life experience because you were jealous of his stuff. That he still wants to speak to you is amazing to me. Are you sure you are his friend?", "YTA \n\nREAD THE ESSAY", "I think the comments on here are a little harsh. We\u2019re talking about two motherless children coming into adulthood. I encourage everyone to remember what you all were like as teenagers. And our brains are not even fully developed at the age of 18!!

I know it\u2019s hard to grow up with a single parent that work\u2019s multiple jobs from experience. What I don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking into consideration is that while you were left alone when your parent was working multiple jobs, Sam was likely left alone while his parent was working a high stress job with a lot of hours. Material Things are not the same as your parent physically being there. I\u2019d bet the two of you have a lot more to relate about with each other than you realize in this area. Losing a parent is always hard. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re rich or poor, have a large extended family or small, etc. It will always be hard. I understand your frustration because on the outside it very much looks like he has it easy, and I also think you should try and set that frustration aside in this situation. It\u2019s not your fault that your dad has to work multiple jobs to provide for you, and it is not Sam\u2019s fault that his dad is wealthy. Maybe try talking with your school counselor about how frustrated you feel in this situation, and then after that maybe you\u2019ll feel ready to talk to Sam.", "Pain and suffering are not competitions. Just because you struggled in a different way doesn't negate his struggles. Be a better friend. YTA. My best friend in high school had a single father with three children. They struggled to pay for a lot of things. They lived in a tiny house with only two bedrooms. Now my family wasn't rich but we were better off financially. So I would help out my friend all the time to pay for things so she wouldn't miss out. I help pay for her marching band trips, dance tickets, dresses, her lunch, her letterman jacket, and a bunch more things. Plus my mom and I would drive her to most school events. Her father and her were always grateful for the help and he would always try to pay pay us back. I guessing, but OP likely had a similar experience. Because who would stay friends with a jerk who just rubs his father's money in your face all the time. OP you probably got many opportunities to do something you could have never done because of your friends money. You got to swim in his pool, play with his expensive toys and games, he probably drove you in his car, and he probably had big parties over the years.

We bonded because we both lost a parent when we were really young, but otherwise our backgrounds couldn\u2019t be any more different. My dad worked 60-70 hours a week to afford a 1-bedroom apartment in a good school district. I wanted to find a part-time job since I saw how exhausted he was every day, but he told me to focus on school instead. Meanwhile, Sam lived with his heart surgeon dad in a 5000 square foot mansion with a pool and a private movie theater. I won't lie, it did hurt sometimes to see Sam living life on easy mode while my dad and I struggled. This was especially true in spring 2020, when my dad was panicking about no longer being able to work while Sam was posting pool selfies.  \nUnfortunately, I never had the opportunity to do the extracurriculars that look good on college applications due to the cost. Im planning to work part-time, complete my requirements at community college, and finish my degree at a 4-year school. Meanwhile, Sam took private piano lessons and had a family friend who arranged for him to work in her university research lab over the summers. He even helped publish a scientific paper. Sam knew since the 7th or 8th grade that he wanted to follow his dad\u2019s footsteps and attend an Ivy League school. Sure, Sam had legacy and connections, but he's also genuinely the hardest-working and smartest person I know.  \nFast forward to last Sunday. Sam invited me and 2 other friends (Amy and Elaine) to his house. He showed us some of the cool stuff that his college sent him before we all went to hang out by the pool. Unsurprisingly, the conversation soon turned towards college and future plans. Amy asked Sam what he wrote about in his college essay. Sam paused for half a second before saying that he mainly wrote about the struggles he had growing up as the child of a single parent.  \nIt was just too much. We were hanging out in a multimillion dollar house with a pool in the backyard, a private movie theater upstairs, a grand piano in the living room, and two BMWs plus a Porsche in the garage. I said \"Sam, really? Do you have any fucking self-awareness at all? How can you even fucking say that you struggled when you know how fucking hard my dad and I have it?\" I then left because I was getting increasingly angry and didn't want to say something that I'd regret.   \nI've been avoiding Sam at school all week because I'm honestly still upset at him, even though Amy and Elaine have said that Sam really wants to talk to me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn't be surprised if he has been steered toward a certain career area with little thought into what he actually wants to do himself, too. \n\nBasically, what I am saying is that someone else's struggles never invalidate your own. I am sure there are people that have it worse than you do, but their struggles wouldn't take anything away from what you are going through. Just like your struggles don't negate the tough times Sam has had.", "I wouldn\u2019t say your a assholes necessarily but you should absolutely apologize and talk to your friend about why you reacted", "I know it's hard, but you need to stop being so bitter. Some people have rich parents, and others don't. \n\nStruggle is not just financial. You and Sam both apparently do not have a mother (or they weren't involved in either of your lives). Money doesn't replace that. Sam's father is also a heart surgeon. He must have spent a lot of time at work to provide all those things you are jealous of while Sam was in the care of nannies or relatives and then as he got older, probably alone. Having money doesn't necessarily mean someone hasn't had struggle and strife in their life. \n\nI'm jealous of Taylor Swift for all the money and talent she has. But there are parts of her life I am thankful not to have.

However he lost a parent too and Surgeons are usually on call and have crazy work schedules as well. He more than likely had a distant father with intense expectations. Not everything is about a financial struggle. It could have been about emotional struggles and such.

Practice some self-awareness of your own.\n\nYTA.", "YTA why does your relationship seem to revolve around your jealousy?", "YTA. There is more to life than money and different types of struggles. I am sorry you have had it so hard but it\u2019s not his fault.", "Im very torn on this one. \n\n\nOne side of me says YTA. You mentioned how his dad is a heart surgeon, so he probably didnt spend much time with him since he would have always been at work. He may have struggled in that sense. Ive grown up with a single mother for about 7yrs now. Im home alone every morning since my mother is at work. It does suck sometimes not being able to spend time with the person you look up to and who is your sole provider growing up. You must have not thought about that side, only the financial struggling side.\n\n\nHowever, i also think your NTA. You clearly grew up in poverty and he didnt, complete opposite people. So I understand that it may be hard for someone to say that they struggled whilst casually being surrounded by tons of money. Everyone instantly jumping to yta are definitely middle/upper class.\n\nOverall, id say ESH. You for not being completely aware of his childhood/ not paying enough attention to his essay. However hes the asshole for bringing it up with you there", "YTA. It might not seem fair to you, but you can\u2019t judge someone else\u2019s struggles because you can\u2019t know what they\u2019re struggling with.

What you do after will determine if you really are the asshole in this situation.\n\nI think you need to take the time and process your anger because it comes from a place of hurt and you don\u2019t want that to turn into resentment. To you in that moment struggling meant something different than it did to Sam. This is what that saying \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness\u201d actually applies to - he may have struggled mentally but not financially unlike you and it\u2019s okay that that upset you. It\u2019s hard to not get upset when you have this person in your life that you share a trauma with but you see that you\u2019re suffering more - it breeds resentment but I think since you had the thought to ask if you\u2019re being an asshole about it that you think more maturely and can see that Sam can be hurting like you just in a different way. There\u2019s a very good chance he could think that same way about you if you have a good relationship with your dad and see him often where his surgeon dad isn\u2019t around as often to give him the support you might get. \n\nYou should at least talk to Sam and see what his essay really said and tell him how his initial description of his essay made you feel. If he\u2019s dismissive or you don\u2019t like the contents of his essay then you can go from there and decide what you want to do.\n\nAlso maybe think about if this will still bother you in a years time because there\u2019s a good chance you may never interact with him once you part ways for college so this could all be moot.", "YTA.

And it\u2019s never good to assume that you have had it worse off than others, especially when it comes to very situational things. I can understand being frustrated but money isn\u2019t always the best thing for people, maybe your friend needed more emotional support and empathy growing up.

All of those things were tailored according to what interests him and how it fits with the university values. \n\nSadly, YTA. It was not about you.

And OP, keep in mind that Sam has done NOTHING wrong here. Hence, your anger at him is totally misdirected. My guess is you've got some deep-seated jealousy which is completely understandable. However, and apologies for being blunt, all of this is a you problem, not a Sam problem. I'd suggest therapy when you start college.

Is it everything no, are may wealthy people unhappy, yes but they\u2019d be even more unhappy if they were poor.", "YTA You are making this about yourself, the world doesn't go around you, grow up. Some people are luckier in life. Just because he didn't have to suffer economically it didn't means he was less happy to loose his mom. Also his dad is  a surgeon probably he was alone all the time. So stop this BS.  That you have it hard doesn't have anything to do with other people. You are just jealous of his live in general", "I sincerely feel for you. Every child deserves a good, stable home. I roll my eyes when people say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness as well. \n\nHowever, I just want to remind you, that stability doesn\u2019t only come from being financially well off. My father was decently successful and I grew up living in nice houses, and I probably seemingly had everything I needed from the outside perspective of other people. However, if you took a closer look inside, you\u2019d see my father was a workaholic, who was emotionally and physically abusive. My mother was an emotionally overwhelming alcoholic who unloaded all her problems on me since I was a small child and became abusive to me as well when I began puberty. They were both neglectful and neither ever made an attempt to better themselves. In fact, they\u2019ve only become more unhinged with time. I moved out with not a penny to my name as soon as I was of legal age to, so I understand the struggle with poverty as well because it has not been easy, and I also envy the privilege that so many people seem to have.\n\nAll that to say, you don\u2019t really know every detail about all the struggles your friend has gone through in his home life. My friends in school definitely didn\u2019t. It sounds like you are misdirecting your frustration of the struggles you\u2019ve experienced in your life on your friend, and that isn\u2019t fair to him. You should try to get some therapy because it sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot and not had the time to properly process it. I hope you\u2019re able to talk this out your friend, and maybe you can leave this situation with a better understanding and appreciation for one  another. Sometimes these difficult moments can bring us closer together if we are open to listen and talk through our feelings.", "If I can give you a word of advice, as you go forward in life don\u2019t try to compare your trauma and what you went through to anyone else, it\u2019s pointless and destructive. You had it hard, yes. That doesn\u2019t mean that anyone who didn\u2019t experience what you did had it easy, and there\u2019s a lot of people who had it a hell of a lot worse. You weren\u2019t beaten and tortured daily but other people are, does that mean you had it easy? We all live with what we have, and it\u2019s rarely easy. \n\nAnd money doesn\u2019t buy happiness, but lack of money sure can cause unhappiness. If your friend had money, there were still plenty of other things to be unhappy about.", "I\u2019d rather go without dinner then get beat the second my dad came home from work lol.  Absolutely insane that you think a parent skipping meals is the worst that can happen.", "No I\u2019m sitting at the dinner table alone because my parents can\u2019t be bothered to eat with their child. They would rather work. Their are more sides of a story than just yours and mine. Everyone has their own story. Doesn\u2019t mean yours is worse or better than mine.", "OP, it sounds like you really need to work on how you view the world. This isn't the suffering olympics. You're expressing a lot of resentment and bitterness towards people who don't deserve it, and that is going to ruin your friendships and life if you let it.", "I do think it came across aggressive, but I agree with it. Someone will always have it worse. Would OP enjoy someone who\u2019s had it even worse telling them they didn\u2019t struggle and how *dare they think otherwise*?", "How weird that OP doesn't understand getting into a top 50 university when his whole life has been about worrying his basic needs won't be met....\n\nThe difference is, someone can lie about facing adversity, with no guilt at all apparently, because when you're rich lying suddenly isn't wrong. OP can't tell a lie and get the benefits of wealth. \n\nColleges force teens to write essays, they don't force teens to lie to get *another advantage* in addition to the extreme advantage of money. \n\nI'm not saying his friend lied, just responding to \"everyone lies.\" No, the people who actually faced adversity didn't lie.", "Same lol, I would\u2019ve gladly rather came home to smaller house and not be yelled or hit at\ud83d\ude05", "Hate the game not the players.", "Exactly OP was poor, but his dad wasn\u2019t abusive. So he shouldn\u2019t complain either because he has it better than kids in an abusive foster care situation.", "His mom is dead. OP may have had it worse, but they both had struggles", "When did he say his life was worse than poor ppl's? His mom died and his dad wasn't present. Ofc that was hard on him. Not everything is about money... It's such a dumb mindset to invalidate ppl's struggles just because others may have it worse.", "He didn't write about how difficult it read losing a mom. He wrote about how much he struggled having a wealthy single father who provided him with every advantage in life. \n\nPain isn't pain. You breaking up with your boyfriend isn't equal to a woman getting brutally beaten and raped. One is significantly worse and has the capacity to ruin a person's life. This kid did not struggle because he was raised by a single parent. \n\nHow often have you faced homelessness and hunger with or as a single that you feel confident saying that's not more pain than the rich kid went through?", "Absolutely! Losing a parent is a huge struggle, and one he genuinely suffered through. Why not write about that rather than pretending you were disadvantaged?", "For all the good one of my parents did me, yes I would. Poverty is hard, especially with a single parent. So yes, I'd trade one for the type of security and amazing opportunities that nepo babies get. I'm not saying losing a parent is easy, but he also didn't write about how hard it was to lose his mom. He wrote about how he struggled being raised by a single parent with total economic security, in a mansion, with golden opportunities presented to him left and right.", "Just ask Batman.", "Working 50-60 would be a low number\u2026if he\u2019s like other surgeons I know, he probably works closer to 80 hours a week.", "Or \u201cMy dad disappeared into work to cope with his grief. I think he thought that by saving other people\u2019s lives, he could stop his own heartache. He disappeared from me, too. I was left alone. Grief was my constant companion. My friends saw the material possessions we had, but they never saw my hurt. They couldn\u2019t see the void my mom\u2019s loss left in my soul. I know that things can\u2019t fill it. Money doesn\u2019t make it better. Yet, some of my so-called friends still think my life is wonderful. I would trade all of to have my mom. To have her hug me and tell me she loved me every day like she used to is one dream I know will never come true.\u201d", "Or his mom. Material things mean little when you are missing someone and are raising yourself.", "To be fair, OP had neither and that's the reason for them getting angry over this", "I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve traded that stuff for his other parent back.", "I would just like to point out that if this kids dad was working all the time to support him, then he both faced poverty and never saw his dad.", "As someone who grew up in poverty with shifty but present parents, nah, fam. I would rather have a cinema room and piano lessons.", "Or his mom.  YTA.  You don\u2019t know what struggles a person is having.", "Totally valid for Sam to have suffered and written about it in his essay, but if Sam grew up in the mansion described here, then odds are that all the hard work you just described was done and over with before Sam existed. If Sam didn\u2019t see his dad, it will have been because of all the stuff that comes *after* all those hard years you just described. Sam\u2019s dad went through that stuff, but probably Sam did not.", "I\u2019d agree with you were it not that OP is now ignoring their friend. That\u2019s what makes them the AH.", "Nepo baby didn't struggle financially. But he didn't have a mom. Dad is a surgeon. Surgeons work notoriously long hours. Maybe Sam was raised by a nanny. Maybe dad didn't ever come to school events. Maybe Sam missed his mom. Maybe Sam struggled being an only child because his mom died before his parents could have more. \n\nSam's life is easy in comparison to yours and mine. But it doesn't mean his pain isn't real, and that his struggles weren't hard for him.", "Because some people understand that \u201cstruggles\u201d aren\u2019t always financial struggles.  And instead of asking further or genuinely taking the time to consider whether or not their friend wanted to *share* something with them in that moment, they saw all the dollar signs of things they wish they have and got angry.\n\nNow.. I *understand* that instinct. And yes, a rich person with a single parent doesn\u2019t have nearly the same struggles as a not-rich person with a single parent. And university admissions are already stacked toward those who are are financially privileged. Clearly, Sam was not at a disadvantage here. \n\nBut OP could have written about their struggles too. And if they both did, or if OP chose not to, then I don\u2019t see an issue here.  It would depend on the actual content of Sam\u2019s essay and if he spun it to make it sound like he wasn\u2019t financially stable. But we may never know that, and OP certainly doesn\u2019t know that yet as he won\u2019t speak to Sam. \n\nOP literally said that Sam is \u201cgenuinely the hardest-working and smartest person\u201d they know. So it\u2019s not as if he simply coasted on his connections *or* his essay. And if they helped him over someone else, it\u2019s a flaw in the system, not in Sam (again, unless he flat out manipulated the essay).\n\nIt is very clear that OP has been resentful for some time about the disparity here, despite very clearly trying not to be. And that\u2019s valid. The system is fucked up. Struggle is real. Privilege is real. Systemic discrimination is real. \n\nBut those things don\u2019t make it less valid for Sam to have actually found it to be a struggle growing up with a single parent, for a variety of reasons. Based on what OP has said about Sam, I would be inclined to say it\u2019s worth having longer conversation about. Maybe the reason OP is avoiding it is because they\u2019re not ready yet to consider the truth possibly being more complicated than \u201crich kid, poor kid.\u201d That\u2019s hard even for adults.", "Nobody said that.\n\nThis kid lost their mother. How cruel can you be?", "Exactly what others have said: struggles don't just mean financial struggles. My parents are well-off; my dad makes good money. I've never worried about food being put on the table, or having a roof over my head, or having to drop out of school to support my family. However, my childhood was littered with abuse in all forms, and it was hidden from everyone around us very well. Friends, teachers, coworkers- no one would have been able to guess what happened behind closed doors. Yet people still assume my life hasn't been difficult, or that my life is perfect, or that I don't have any worries at all. I've been told that my life is perfect, that I have nothing to complain about. It sucks when everyone assumes you can have no issues when your family is doing well financially.", "I learned this term today.  Proximital abandonment.", "I know. I feel for Sam", "And you're making a very bold assumption that OP wouldn't have equated happiness with regular meals and not having to watch their father at the coal face for 70 hours a week. It's a different perspective for everyone. Just because you don't, please don't assume OP shouldn't either. That said OP is still YTA for the blow up that shows clear as day that they just haven't communicated with one of their so called best friends. Even if it turned out that the communication was present and Sam was laying on the whole \"I lost my parent\" thing constantly, OP would still be TA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm more interested to know (but won't) is if Sam's essay was pitched as a sob story or if it was more a framing context as to where he's come from and where he wants to go. Because he's not TA in saying how he got to where he is. It's not his fault his making the best of the hand he's been dealt and if you bothered to actually talk to him it's almost a certainty he'd give up all that lovely house/pool/activity crap to have his mother back.", "Agree with this comment.", "OP\u2019s friend has to write about a hardship or a time where they faced adversity. American colleges require it. OP asked the question and friend answered. Friend wasn\u2019t bragging about anything, simply answering a question.", "You voted ESH and proceeded to provide zero reasons why Sam is an AH. Closest thing I see is that some other rich person in your past was an asshole for bragging, which Sam didn\u2019t do.", "Almost all the essays are something like that. Mine was even less applicable than that. It was more about understanding that diversity existed in general. \n\nThat is why I think OP is such AH. Colleges require this and the friend has to write about something. Losing a parent seems like a pretty decent topic. I\u2019ve read and written on this topic on things that are far less meaningful.", "Like money makes life easier but it dossnt mean 0 problems", ">Not everything is about money...\n\nNo, but money makes everything way easier, and its absence in this country means you *actually* struggle every single day. It means you don't see your parents, and you don't know if you'll get kicked out of your apartment, and you don't get extracurriculars and your mental and physical health bare the impact of that constant stress. This kid doesn't know what it means to struggle being raised by a single parent because his frame of reference is so privileged. Kid should have written about how difficult it is to lose a mother. That's a struggle he's genuinely experienced.", "Yup \ud83d\udc4d", "I feel so sorry for both kids, they've both lost so much. I think OP needs a bit of tough love here tho tbh.", "Yup.

My parents sucked too, and we were poor, but I'm assuming Sam's dad is nicer than ours!", "I think this is exactly the point. That it's different for everyone, depending where they're coming from.

The only possible mitigation would be if Sam literally said that he pitched a sob story to look better. But judging by OP's comments it's more like he pointed out how he got to be where he is and how he's had to work for it without the kind of childhood the majority of people are lucky enough to have. Makes me wonder how long OP been nursing the grudge or why he even bothers calling Sam his friend at all.", "True. However, this situation is not about deciding who has it worse, it\u2019s about OP having some underlying issues with the friend being rich. It\u2019s not like his friend took anything away from hin and losing your mom is probably equally hard on the child regardless of how much money is in the bank. My judgement would be YTA, first or all Sam was asked what he wrote the essay about, he didn\u2019t rub it in peoples faces and say pity me, I had it so hard. Seems like OP doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s so bad to lose a loved one when you have money in the bank, like - come on! So he blew up on his friend who is supposedly the hardest working guy for nothing, and now he even goes so far to ignore him? Dude\u2026 this is not a race in who had it worse, and even though more money helps, it\u2019s also not the solution to all problems. Very ignorant towards a so-called friend imo.", "Yeah I'm sure Dad missed things like soccer games and piano recitals, things that are important to children, because of his work.

There are scolarships and all that. Not to mention that Ivy doesn't neccessarily mean better education, just getting it from a famous school.", "Why is OP the one in need of perspective rather than the friend? Bro is a rich kid who has had every advantage with his dad paving the way into an Ivy League school, and he's writing about how he struggled in life. Seriously? Maybe the rich kid should spend some time experiencing the reality the vast majority of the country experiences. It might teach him to appreciate his life more.", "I'm just curious. Are you saying this as someone who faced homelessness or an imminent that over it?", "> You're reducing it to dollar signs when it's actually opportunities. This kid has had millions of opportunities in life that most people could never even dream of having. His whole life was secured for him before he was even born. \n\nNo I\u2019m not. I\u2019m aware. I work in the system. Believe me\u2026 I am *extremely* aware. \n\n> Pointing out that not all struggles are financial is something people do when they have no concept of how detrimental poverty is to physical and psychological health. \n\nNo\u2026 it\u2019s something people do when they are able to think critically and a nuanced way because they have experienced both poverty and privilege. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s just the truth. Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine as someone financially struggling that your life wouldn\u2019t be WAY easier if you had financial privilege. It would. But that doesn\u2019t make struggles people in privileged financial positions have less valid or less real.  \n\n> People with economic security will tell you money can't buy happiness, but I think most people in poverty will tell you it's damn near impossible to be happy without it.\n\nSo Sam is obligated to\u2026 what, exactly? Not share his feelings about how he grew up with his friends, because they had a single parent *and* they were poor?\n\nYes this is hard to hear about and is going to be uncomfortable because of the dynamics between them. No, that won\u2019t ever really go away. Sam did take a pause, and I think that shows he acknowledges this to be true. But he spoke up anyway, which makes me wonder why he didn\u2019t just obfuscate. \n\nMaybe Sam totally manipulated the essay to make himself sound impoverished.

Just because he's more privileged than me doesn't mean I can't be compassionate.\n\nI also wouldn't consider complaining about a vacation to be about trauma the way losing a parent is like in the OP. I'd say a more comparable example would be if someone were to tell you, \"I got mugged during my trip to the Bahamas, and it was really scary,\" and you responded with, \"at least you go on vacations at all, jeez.\"", "None of those things mean he\u2019s not an asshole lol, my dad also would allow my friends to come over for swimming and then I\u2019d get a belt or something afterwords\ud83e\udd28", "Who are you to decide that breaking your leg is worse than stubbing your toe?\n\nThat\u2019s what you sound like.", "But like even if you feel your whatever is worse\u2026why do people feel the need to vocalise it and belittle others? \n\nI\u2019ve had a second degree on the entirety of my left forearm\u2026I don\u2019t feel the need to remind my friends that mine hurt so much more when they get burned/hurt \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah sure.\n\nExcept that it's possible to break a bone and hardly feel it.
