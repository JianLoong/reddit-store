Therefore, the AH assumes the consequences.", "Wow he\u2019s the dad and is complaining about cleaning up a mess his child made? Where do you women find these men? He has a responsibility to her even if you do have full custody. I would tell him there is no way I am going to pay for tickets to an amusement park nor cleaning a rental car.", "I see why you're divorced.  He's the AH here. Damn, what's wrong with him.", "NTA. The words to describe him go against community standards, and I don't wanna be banned.", "NTA. Most others here have dealt with the fact that he clearly is a sandwich short of a picnic if he thinks you should pay, but I'll talk about the part where you say 'Some friends are telling me to just split it with him' - friends? Friends say that? Your friends?  WTF? Nah, these are not friends. Bin them all off, you are NTA. You are a great parent - sod the rest of them.", "Definitely NTA. You reminded him (though he should know), and you prepped for him. You did more than enough! He seems petty having his family message you\u2026also, it was his choice to take her..why are you paying for the tickets..unless you bill him for 50% of all her needs and outings and snacks and trips?", "Um he\u2019s so dumb. You\u2019re NTA!!", "This mess is entirely his fault. He needs to pay, not you. NTA", "NTA. Stand your ground. You set him up for success by verbally reminding him, dressing your daughter and packing the bag. He fucked around and found out you were right in the steps you took. His bad. His stupidity.  This may be hard but block him, family and friends who are encouraging you to split the bill. He was parenting, badly and those are his consequences.  Please block all those losers. You don't need any of these morons in your life.", "Agree to pay half if he pays half cleaning for all of the hundreds of times you\u2019ve cleaned her and her stuff. Tell him you want to be fair.  NTA", "NTA.  Your ex created this situation by deciding he somehow knew better than you about what your kid needed for the trip, and did so despite your attempts to mitigate the risks of a mess.  He knew that the kid has a medical condition that makes holding her bowls and bladder for any significant length of time impossible, but disregarded this objective reality in favor of his own delusion that everything would be fine.  In short, this whole thing is his fault and he should pay 100% of the costs.", "Send a cash request for all the cleanings of your stuff that from toileting accidents, I mean it\u2019s half his child too right?    This man is an idiot don\u2019t give him money for his stupidity", "NTA. It\u2019s his kid and he chose to deny her needs.", "NTA OP. F your ex AND his family.", "The fact you have to ask is sad. No you're NTA. He is. He refused to listen and is an absent parent. You're not responsible for his bad decisions when you did everything needed to make sure she was prepared for this. Including reminding her father about her condition, which is going above and beyond IMO", "Not only should you not reimburse him, he should be reimbursing you for the supplies you provided for him that he discarded. A proper non custodial parent would have had his own supplies for her.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA. I can see why he\u2019s an ex.", "Nope - absolutely NTA.\n\nI also had an underdeveloped bladder as a child and had pretty frequent UTIs because of it. My mother was hyper fucking vigilant about making sure I went to the bathroom before leaving anywhere and as soon as I got anywhere - just in case. He should have known better than to throw this supplies away!", "And share this info with your lawyer, if you have one. Document. Save screenshots, especially if you have anything where he acknowledges that you gave him proper supplies and he did not use them.\n\nWhat he did was abusive to your daughter. At some point down the road, you may be, addressing this kind of behavior formally.", "Don\u2019t bring [Ned](https://www.gyfted.me/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fcharacters%2Fned-flanders.png&w=640&q=75) into this, that neighborino would have paid the full cost no hesitation!!\n\n/s", "Yes.

He threw them all away, he needs to pay full.", "Please rethink this. It\u2019s embarrassing for a child to be put through this, and we know he still feels he is right since his flying monkeys are harassing you.", "Yeah exactly.", "SDMcDF (Sperm Donor McDick Face)", "May be overkill, but I reach to the back (or the one that doesn't look sticky or wrinkled) for everything: milk, underwear, face cream, a bag of spinach.", "This is the way.", "Well you could send an invoice for all of the times you had to clean things or pay for other problems she may have cost you. And half of all costs that were above what child support didn't cover. Then you take that $56k bill cut it in half then deduct the $2k for cleaning the car and tickets. The deduct the 2k from the $28k so he owes you $26 that he can make monthly payments on.\n\nNTA tell him to start paying up on top of child support.", "NTA! \nDon\u2019t give that man nan-cent. You packed a bag and made sure he had all the necessities. His dumbass threw out the bag and acted like he knew better than you and your child. As the saying goes play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Don't! You told him. He didn't listen. Send HIM a bill to reimburse YOU for the bag, diapers and clothes that he threw out!", "No! Not the AH, had he listened and not thrown bag away this whole drama would be moot, did his family insist on him reimbursing you for throwing away the bag? and he also wants half the cost to the amusement park now too, unless it was agreed on before you shouldn't pay he is being an AH, you're friends are wrong also, maybe he will listen next time, stand firm!", "Sounds like a boy not a man", "You procreated with an utter and complete jackass. Don't give him a dime, he can kick rocks. NTA", "NTA whatsoever. I can't imagine a parent acting like he is.", "NTA", "*\"...but I allow him to visit her and take her out when he\u2019s in town...\"*\n\nOh, you *ALLOW* that?  I'm sorry, but your ex-husband has EVERY right to have a relationship with his daughter.  Period.  Also, you did a piss poor job of potty training your daughter.  I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  Pay for the damn cleaning fees and stop being an idiot.", "He pay child support? If not send him papers for child support and back child support. That cleaning fee and ticket will not look so bad.", "NTA. A father is responsible for any damages that his child causes. Even if he had listened to you, he would still be responsible for these charges.\n\nEdit to add: Send him a Venmo request for the cost of therapy. She may need to talk to someone after this instance of medical neglect.", "NTA. He is aware of her condition. You prepared well for any situations and he chose to ignore what he KNEW he needed to do. This is on him. Don't you dare give him any money.", "Does he pay 1/2 for everything I\u2019m sure you have had things ruined by your daughter im sure you feed/clothing and other expenses or does he just pay a fixed child support.    I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not 1/2 of your expenses for her.   Just my male opinion.", "NTA. You gave him instructions on how to avoid what happened. He ignored them. He is fully responsible. End of story.", "NTA! She is his child too. If he's stupid enough to disregard your instructions and toss the supplies you sent then the accident is on him. I'd tell him \"too bad so sad it's on you\". If it happened on your time with her you alone would be responsible for the repercussions.", "Did you reply with a request for half the food bill for the month, half the rent since it's her housing, half the clothing/school supplies bill, etc.etc. Keep sending them every month because hey, it's \"our kid\" so it should be split equally.", "NTA, but it seems like there's a reason why you have full custody. Is your ex in a place where your kid seeing him isn't more harm than good for her?", "You\u2019re NTA\nThe audacity of him, not only is he treating his daughter like a child you asked him to babysit, but he also has his family harassing you. Fuck this guy. (not in the fun way that will produce another child). any friends that you have that are trying to convince you to \u201cjust pay for it\u201d can pay for it.", "I\u2019d Venmo him for the stuff he threw away.", "NTA-Besides the fact he\u2019s her DAD, you informed him and provided all necessary supplies to prevent the accident. What\u2019s he going to do anyway, sue you for the money? He will get humiliated/reemed out by the judge anyway. I\u2019m sorry your daughter has that asshole for a dad.", "NTA that is obvious. \n\nAND this man is in your life for a while. You need to decide which hill to die on and where to set up a boundary.

Good luck.\ud83c\udf40", "NTA - *his* child made a mess, in *his* rental car, during *his* visitation time, as a direct result of *his* parenting choices. \n\n This is simply not your problem.", "NRA. Don\u2019t split the cost and stop discussing it with relatives that may embarrass your daughter.", "Who does he think he is? He's the daddy. Not some Joe blo from next street. Suck a jackass. NTA.", "NTA. Tell his family that he was too stupid to listen and remember his own daughter\u2019s condition and thought he knew better despite you reminding him and packing her a bag with the essentials so the mess is his own fault.", "I was believing this story up until the part where his family actually starting messaging you to pay up? That\u2019s one hell of a story", "NTA, this is the second story I\u2019ve read today about someone warning/trying to help someone out and the person just being to arrogant to listen and then asking the OP for something and getting mad when they decline, just cut contact with your ex\u2019s family, I don\u2019t really see much reason for you to be in contact with them since it\u2019s you and your ex\u2019s child", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t allow any unsupervised visits going forward. Also document everything, just in case.", "Whether she allows him or it is court ordered, she does not owe him anything.  The fact that you cannot see that says a lot about you so I will not even try common sense with you.  She had a medical condition had nothing to do with potty training.  She made it clear, she sent pull-ups and clothes he discarded them.", "You're the first person to say they got that reference. And a photo \ud83d\ude0d", "This is why you need to document it and take it to your lawyer. The last thing you want is him deciding he's gonna fight you for custody because he thinks he knows better than you.", "This makes me feel better, my son is 5\u00bd and still wears pull ups at night, and I don't ever ask for advice or anything on it cause I know I'll get the 'don't let them drink anything after xyz time' and that always makes me cringe.", "Its wasn't a mistake when he knows of his daughters condition and the op even reminded him and provided everything he would need to deal with it. He blatantly disregarded that, threw away property that wasn't his and forced his child into an embarrassing situation. That's willful ignorance not stupidity. Like did he really think he knows better than medical professionals and the parent that has full custody."]}
