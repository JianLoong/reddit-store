Before our diagnosis my family use to tell me that my son was just lazy and should have been potty trained a long time ago. I feel bad that it took me so long to realize what was happening (he was my first child so all new to me). It is a rough road and I feel for you so much. Keep your head up and tell \"dad\" to kick rocks.", "NTA if he was around more he would be more aware of her condition he was also supplied with equipment and chose to ignore you", "1000% NTA He didn't listen.  Put all those who are whining on IGNORE.  Ridiculous of them to think you should pay half for your ex's stupidity", "NTA  block his family... he should've took the bag you packed...", "NTA\n\nHow many items of yours has she had accidents on? Did you ever demand half the cleaning fee from him? Reply with an invoice for half the various cleaning products/services you\u2019ve purchased for this reason.", "NTA.  There wouldn't have been a mess if she had pullups on.  Tell your family you've made your decision and you're not going to discuss it further.", "Um. He is her parent every bit as much as you are. He is responsible for her during her parenting time. He is resonsible for accomodating her medical condition. He didn't do that. The resulting mess was not your daughter's fault - It was HIS.  \n\nThere is absolutely no need for you to take financial responsiblity for 50% of choices that He Made. \n\nAlso, I'd be very careful about letting him have her unsupervised after this. His reaction seems  petty and vindictive. If he is behaving this way toward you, what did he say to her? \n\nNTA", "Venmo request him for the supplies who tossed out! NTA", "Venmo him for all the times she had an accident in your care. Tell him to deduct it from that", "NTA your ex is both an idiot and a bad father.  He knows his daughter has this condition and went out of his way to not merely ignore it, but actively removed things that would mitigate its effects.  You should be telling him he can forget visiting your daughter until he can take the responsibility of caring for her properly, I can't imagine how unpleasant that must have been for her.", "NTA but your Ex is a Mega-asshole.  Your poor kid must have had a really bad day.  I hope you don't allow any more of these type of excursions.", "Tell him, \"I'm very glad you want to go 50/50 on the cost of raising our daughter. I'm happy to contribute to half the costs of this incident as I am certain you intend to contribute half the cost of raising our daughter.\" And then spell out the expenses not covered by his child support and request he match you dollar for dollar for her education fund.", "NTA.  Stupidity should be both painful and expensive so that lessons are learned.  Your ex acted stupidly so he can pay.", "Send him a Venmo request for the supplies he threw away. NTA.", "NTA. Ex decided to FA and now he FO. Sounds like a personal problem.", "NTA. Stand your ground. How many messes have you footed the bill for without asking him for reimbursement? Part time Daddy, can take financial responsibility for his child for the few times a year he has her. Or you can make a list of what you have paid for over the years and venmo him for his half.", "That is VERY strange. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I need some clarification: does he split the costs with you when you take the daughter to the park? Let's say, during the year, you have the full custody, if you decide to go to the zoo with the daughter, does he chip in?", "She's his daughter, and was in his custody. He's 100% responsible for her during that time. He chose to go his own way, he chose to take that risk. He subjected his daughter to unnecessary unpleasantness. He's 100% the ass.\n\nHe did this to himself.", "Even if it had been Ned from next door, it would've been on him for deciding he knows better", "Is it this considered abusive? It feels it. I bet your daughter felt awful for this, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable him seeing her unsupervised again", "He probably kept some information hidden from his family, like OP giving him the stuff their kid needs.\n\nAnd that stuff can't be cheap, so chucking is in the trash is a absolute AH move. Send him a venmo for replacing the medically necessesary items.", "Turn the tables, he actually owes you for throwing away the supplies you gave him! Dad's that don't own the responsibilities of having a child deserve their own ring in hell!", "I\u2019d be even more petty and demand half of the cost of the pull ups and diapers I provided that he saw fit to toss.", "Can't give any better advice than this!", "Honestly, I would say \"I will refund you half the amt as you are now downgraded to 'friend'. I am no longer allowing you to have unsupervised visits. Have a good day\"", "And make sure the Venmo is public \"Replacing our child's medical supplies you decided to throw away\" lmfao", "Child support paid or not, he had the means to prevent this, but decided he knew better, and threw out the preventative.  His fault, his cost.  On top of that, do you have any idea how much pull ups, and diapers cost these days.  He had half the cost in the bag, but choose to throw it away instead.  This is all on him.", "So if he takes her to a friend's house and she accidentally breaks something, mom should pay half of the reimbursement if he pays child support? Uh, no!", "And splitting the cost of the tickets to the actual amusement park?  He spent one day with her doing an activity he chose, and wants mom to split the cost of that too?  Ridiculousness on top of ridiculousness.", "I'd venmo him for every cost after that. He'd find out really quick how much his child support doesn't cover.", "Same, I read that and went \"Eww, how do you know someone hadn't tried it on? How do you know it's not cleaned with some harsh chemicals that will give her a rash?\"\n\nBut then clearly someone who refuses to acknowledge a medical condition isn't going to care about such things either.", "That's not unreasonable. Clothes are ready to wear from the shop, and you're not allowed to try the underwear on so they shouldn't be pre-worn. I can't speak for what the OP's ex bought, but underwear I buy is in a little cardboard sleeve that breaks if the underwear is removed.", "Exactly!!!!!", "NTA and please answer back that you provided everything needed for this to be avoided and despite reminding him when he picked her up he decided to throw away the stuff you gave him- the gall of that ah?!! He could have brought it back unused - and that he knew better than you\n\n\n He can now deal with the consequences including financial of his own decisions all alone.", "To me, this is almost abuse. He knew she has a problem, he saw what you'd provided for her, and he ignored everything. He set her up to make a mess and - I assume - shouted at her too when it happened. She's now old enough to be embarrassed, even though she can't help it. Did he think that ignoring it would mean it didn't exist? What if your daughter has other problems - will he ignore them or shout them  away? Tell his family he set her up for the accident and let them make their own decisions. It's time for supervised or zero visits.", "Forcing a child to wet themselves is abuse and medical neglect since it's due to a medical condition. I would make him do supervised visits until he can meet her needs but that's just me\n\n Yeah sure she might go a few times without and not have a problem but she still needs pull ups for medical purposes it's like taking a wheelchair away from someone who can walk without it but not for long periods of time", "Document. And you may want to reconsider him having unsupervised time with her since he willfully ignores her medical needs. This will only continue to cause her embarrassment and shame.", "Does this mean no child support?", "He can always take you to court. CYOA", "It sounds like he is ashamed and in denial of her medical condition. I wouldn't let him be around her, he will make her ashamed too.", "I\u2019d be more angry about this I think.", "That's why you need to document the incident because imo it's abuse", "I'd document all of this so that if he tries to push back if you don't allow him to see her, you have the proof of why.", "Generally, kids' undies are never tried on, especially if they come in the multi packs covered in plastic. Not saying what he did was right, and the undies need to be washed before wear.", "Almost all fabrics used to make clothing etc have a \u201csize\u201d (mix of chemicals) on them to do a variety of things, from reducing wrinkles to making colours seem brighter. They can irritate the skin which is why many items have a \u201cwash before use\u201d instruction.", "The shop I buy new underwear from has multipacks in plastic packaging, but you can open the packaging without damaging it. If a pack looks like it's been opened and the undies taken out, I will not touch that pack. I'll take another one that has obviously not been touched", "You really need to Google this. Even the manufacturer will tell you to wash your clothing before wearing. Between the many people touching, the tactile machinery, the chemicals they use in the factory, and on the material used to make the clothing, you really should wash your clothing, at least your underwear.", "I work in the garment industry and I implore you all to wash your clothes before wearing them. Even socks. I swear y\u2019all don\u2019t want to know what goes on in a factory.", "Clothes are not ready to wear and filled with chemicals. They all need to be washed before being worn.", "Ewwww! No no no no no! You are so off base here, ALL clothing should be washed before being worn, especially underwear! I worked for Victoria's Secret; the amount of stains, mystery wet, and just ick coming from warehouse, not to mention people TRY ON PANTIES. Please wash your new clothes! Packaging is not sterile!", "What? No! Wash the clothes!", "You are entirely wrong. Most clothing manufacturers coat clothing in urea-formaldehyde (which used to be used in home insulation too, until it was banned in the 80's in North America) to keep them from wrinkling and staining until they are purchased. Both are irritating to sensitive skin (you know, like genitals.)\n\nClothing dye contains quinoline, which has been shown to initiate cancerous tumor growth in mice and also causes skin irritation, and is exacerbated by sweat (you know, that stuff your crotch makes when you're at an amusement park all day).\n\nDon't be a dingus and give people advice on something you know nothing about.", "If Dad makes the child feel at all embarrassed or guilty about the situation then there should be a special place in hell for him!", "No almost about it in my opinion. It absolutely is neglect, so it's abuse", "My son was the same didn\u2019t believe it but a few weeks before he turned 7 he was dry and been fine ever since.", "I worked at a kids\u2019 clothes store, and we had underwear multipacks in plastic that snapped shut. They could be opened and often were as parents wanted to look at the size/cut. I was able to roll the underwear back up and no one would ever know that the pack had been opened. I only ever had one issue with underwear in years\u2026 someone returned underwear they had bought because it had a skid mark. A coworker must have accepted a return on used and soiled underwear (taking the customer at her word, which I did). Wash your stuff.", "Kinda wanna know now", "The Red Hot Chili Peppers visit the factory every day and dicksock all of the merch."]}
