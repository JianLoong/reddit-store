Not Ned from next door. There is literally zero excuse for him not knowing and understanding her medical condition. Given that you informed him, warned him, and provided him with supplies the accident was just karma at its absolute finest.\n\nDon't give him a cent. Your shared child, *with appropriate accommodations in place,* didn't cause this. His daughter, in the undies *he bought*, because he must know more than the custodial parent, had an accident. Had he been a little less egotistical and paid a little more attention, this never would have happened.", "NTA You gave her \"father\" the supplies needed to take care of your daughter's incontinence problem. He disregarded your advice and instructions. He threw away the bag you packed to alleviate the problem. He decided to rent a car, take her to an amusement park (typical Disney Dad) and try his luck. Seems like his luck failed him. He planned this outing, he can pay for it.", "NTA. You cannot be blatantly aware of your child's medical issues but decide that they can control it and they're big enough to wear underwear. It was an entirely avoidable situation And only happened because of his hubris.", "NTA and document this interaction in case you run into custody issues.", "NTA - you made preps, he ignored them. Architect of his own misfortune", "NTA - does he pay child support? He only has to be a parent a few times a year and he botched it. He can\u2019t cover that?", "NTA, FAFO. You literally reminded him, gave him supplies, made sure your daughter was in suitable attire. He tossed the supplies, made a special trip to buy panties, paid no heed to her very real problems, she made a mess, but totally not her fault. So now he expects you to pay for his stupidity?? Just wow. Don't give him a penny. Just maybe that toilet paper award.", "NTA. Send him an itemized list for the full replacement costs of the bag, the additional outfit, and diapers that he threw away. Even if he thought he knew better, he could have left the emergency bag in the trunk of the car. Throwing it out was malicious.\n\nPlease do not pay him a dime for HIS poor decisions. Also feel free to tell off any of his relatives who call to complain about your refusal to use your hard earned money to pay for his mistakes. \n\nExtra hugs to your daughter.", "NTA\nTf he's the father. Wtf", "NTA. Play stupid games,win stupid prizes.", "NTA. \n\nNot only did you warn him of his condition, but you also supplied him with diapers et al.

Actions, meet consequences. I'm surprised you didn't laugh right in his face when he asked for reimbursement. NTA at all. I only feel bad for your daughter being put through that by her knucklehead father.", "Not a dime. You advised an adult and provided solutions. He denied obvious issue and selected obvious failure decisions. Not sharing the blame sets the rule for future activities. Hold to your decision to be right.", "NTA and this is why they invented the acronym FAFO.", "NTA. His car, his kid, his problem. \n\nIf your daughter did that with you, you wouldn't ask him to pay half. You would pay. \n\nHe knew the issue. You gave him everything he needed, and he apparently knew better and had to show that this wasn't an issue and how she's a big girl. This is on him. \n\nYou already have full custody. You take care of her 95% of the time. Why would any father ask you to pay half when spending time with his daughter.

What did he say when he was cleaning it up?\n\nI'm sorry, but your ex can *not* be trusted with your daughter.

He slept so soundly, he just didn't wake up. The pediatrician referred us to a urologist and he told us with time, as he grew, it would get better. He was so kind, he explained to my son the some children have to wear night-night pants because their body forgets to tell them to pee when they are asleep and it will get better and not to worry.", "Mm okay. Still NTA. He embarrassed her for his own ego. Now she will feel upset and traumatized that she caused an argument or her father is angry with her and won\u2019t want to see her as much. He is \ud83d\udcaf the AH", "You should tell him that the cost of those pull ups and nighttime pull ups is your part of the cleaning cost sense he threw out good money. If he had just stuck to the plan this would have never happened.", "Of course she's upset. He probably made her feel bad or ashamed of her accident then didn't even take her to the amusement park he bought tickets for. Screw that guy and his cleaning bill. He's a shitty father.", "All joking aside, I think that's wise. Just keep emphasizing it was an accident, and let your daughter know it okay to bunny-hop your way to a goal; three steps forward and two steps back is still net forward progress. Best wishes to you both moving forward!"]}
