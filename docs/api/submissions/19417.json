His wife wants to play mommy and me with your daughter. Do not allow that woman her.

He had multiple opportunities to be a substantial figure in his daughter's life and he chose not to take any of them. Now he's regretting his decisions. Too bad.\n\nYou don't have to let his wife into your home and you don't have to let your daughter stay overnight with your ex. Your refusals are causing problems for him and his wife? What a pity. Fortunately, their problems aren't your problems.", "NTA. \n\nHe and his wife having problems sounds like a him problem and not a you problem. \n\nYou don't need to do anything to make his life more convenient for him. \n\nHe needs to do the work if he wants to spend time with his daughter, which he isn't willing to do. It sounds as though it's his wife that wants to see your daughter which sounds pretty questionable to me. I would keep them away from your daughter until you see consistent genuine care from them.", "You have a doctor and two lawyers' opinions now you  want random redittors opinions?", "NTA. I hope you both already have some detailed boundaries set up and a (detailed) plan on how you guys are going to be co-parenting. If you don't then set up rules right away. Your kid is young now and she doesn't need drama growing up. It can be quite stressful for the kid. \n\nBesides if you're not comfortable with getting his partner involved then you don't have to. You already have experts advising against it. \n\nI wonder what problems it's causing between him and his wife though... \ud83e\udd14", "NTA.  If he wants a different arrangement, he needs to get a custody agreement from the court.", "NTA.  Call your lawyer.", "NTA. I assume he wants all this stuff to try and reduce his child support payments, without actually having to do the parenting. \u2018We are going to stay over and play with the baby, while you do all the heavy lifting\u2019 is not a coparenting plan. \n\nI suggest you let your lawyer deal with this and don\u2019t engage.", "NTA \n\nHe has chosen not to have much of a relationship with his child and now he wants to bring a whole nother person into it? This will just be confusing on the child and will probably cause things in the future", "NTA.  Hell no.", "NTA. You're past the point of dealing directly with one another. People who can't make a relationship work to a baby's 1st birthday rarely do better once they're officially split up.\n\nStop engaging and leave it to the lawyers and Family Court.", "NTA. He quite literally fucked around and found out.", "NTA - however OP before it turns into a potential telenovela, you're going to have to get things hammered out with a legal agreement.  Especially if he has any additional children with his new wife.  He's definitely not been a model father from your posting and you need to protect yourself and your daughter, and something a lot of parents who are estranged often fail to realize is that legal guardianship is an issue that needs to be dealt with when another family has already been formed in the event something happens to one of the parents.  You just can't leave anything to chance.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Now he is demanding that I allow: -his wife into MY home to meet our daughter -\" .. DEMAND? This is ridiculous. Just make it a NI, and refuse to discuss it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" We have no official court order nor child support order\" .. Start documenting everything. You might need one. Talk to a lawyer. And stop asking him to have your kid unsupervised - ther e likely is a VERY GOOD reason why his gf does not have custody, protect your kid.", "NTA\n\nAside from professionals already telling you not to do this. At this point, I wouldn\u2019t allow him around your daughter. She has lost all her kids??? He only wants to meet at your house??? They want immediate over nights??? There is something seriously wrong with them. Don\u2019t let them in your home. There are so many serious concerns and red flags, and your ex is playing loose and free with your child\u2019s safety. He knows something wrong is going on with his wife and he isn\u2019t telling you what\u2019s up. I\u2019m sorry you are doing this alone and your ex is of zero help. But her not being able to have more kids isn\u2019t your problem. Their at home issues are your problem. Your home is not their mini vacation from reality. Please find a support system that is stable and reliable and remove him from the dynamic until your daughter is old enough to speak.", "NTA and this woman doesn\u2019t have custody of her kids?

Do NOT let your child around her until\n you find out more info. \nIt sounds like she wants a kid and is pushing the info, but he doesn't really care. \n\nAlso, if he is not paying child support, you need to get that fixed. \n\nDo you want to deal with this for 18 years? If not, I would put a stop to everything, but his supervised visits as agreed upon. \n\nDon't give an inch without child support and him showing actual interest in the child (like filing for more visitation). \n\n100% NTA", "NTA", "Wow, NTA.\n\nDoes your custody agreement spell out the rules regarding other people in your lives? Maybe it should? \n\nYou can always make HIM take you back to court to change the custody agreement if what you\u2019ve been doing is within the current guidelines. My guess is he\u2019s looking for an excuse not to do any of this, but the little woman apparently wants to make some kind of narcissistic statement. Match made in heaven, really.\n\nHe\u2019s got a pair on him, that\u2019s for sure.", "Where is this guy from?  Planet Narcissus?  He's demanding you follow his rules in your house?   I wouldn't let him in the house anymore.  I'd meet him in a park or a public setting.  The more he demands the less I'd give him.", "NTA, and to send a 9 month old baby to spend the night with essentially total strangers would be unnecessarily upsetting for her.
