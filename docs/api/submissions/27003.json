Combined we make about 170k a year. We decided on a place that is perfect for us to get married at and never expected anyone to help because, 1 we chose a place that fits our budget and 2, it\u2019s ultimately our day and what we want so we planned on paying for it ourselves. Now my fianc\u00e9s parents make more then my family does. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s parents offered to help in any way they can and have paid for stuff without us even asking. They paid for our bridal shower, which included the gifts, the food, and the rental spot. They also paid for her dress which was about 1k. My parents volunteered to pay for the rehearsal dinner and the dessert. We chose a place for the dessert and gave my parents a price. We chose to do cupcakes and just a little 2 tier cake from a popular bakery called everything bundt cakes. Well when we went to place the order we found out the \u201cbundtinis\u201d are really small and decided maybe we should double the order. I called my mom and she confirmed it was ok even though the price was doubled. I asked her if she was sure because they were planning a trip to Mexico at the time and my dad was working a second job to be able to afford it. I told my mom I don\u2019t care if she wanted to do something else because of the price change but she reassured me it was fine. So we placed the order and thought that was that.\n\nNow on to the issue, a few days after we placed our order I get a text from my sister saying we need to talk. So I texted back asking what was up. She goes on this huge rant saying I need to stick up for my parents because they work so hard for what they have and me deciding to double the dessert order what\u2019s bullshit. I tried explaining to her that our parents agreed to it and reassured me it was fine. It wasn\u2019t like I told my parents this is what we are doing and you don\u2019t have a choice. My sister started calling my fianc\u00e9 a cry baby and me and ungrateful bitch. I told her if she kept it up she will be uninvited to our wedding because I will not put up with the way she is talking to us. She said fine take me out because I\u2019m done with you and you won\u2019t see your niece ever again. There was a lot more choice words that were said that I won\u2019t get in to but my fianc\u00e9 was upset and crying and I won\u2019t stand for that. I have completely cut my sister off and have not talked to her since. I didn\u2019t have a conversation with my dad and a lot of tears were shed between us. I haven\u2019t talked to my mom because she makes excuse after excuse for my sister as to why she acts the way she does. I have also went low contact with her because I don\u2019t wanna start any more drama.\n\nSo I ask if I\u2019m the asshole for going NC with my sister even though she\u2019s family?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify that my dad DID NOT pick up a second job just for this wedding. He\u2019s been working a second job for a while now on the weekends just for extra money for anything he wants to do. My mom is a home body and her number 1 excuse for not doing anything is money. They did end up going on vacation and had a wonderful time, but my dad uses this money for baseball games, high end whiskey he likes to drink, gas for his motorcycle rides. Stuff like that\n\nEdit #2 a lot of you are saying my dad took a second job to make ends meet which isn\u2019t the case. He\u2019s had a second job on the weekends driving a limo for extra money period. He didn\u2019t take a second job to pay for desserts for a wedding.\n\nEdit #3 and may be my final edit. I offered to pay the difference of the dessert or pay for the rehearsal dinner they also offered to pay for to offset the cost. The desserts we chose were the cheapest option we found that didn\u2019t include a professional baker. I\u2019ve also told my parents I don\u2019t care about the money but they, once again, reassured me it was fine after a lengthy phone call.", "created_utc": 1694891276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kfcd0/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 1364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see some saying you should have paid the difference without telling your parents, which would have been insulting if they feel they're competing with your fianc\u00e9's family, thereby saving face. I don't think these commenters have gone through wedding prep and execution - - managing feelings and expectations is part and parcel. \n\nI'm going to make the assumption you're having a simple wedding since the wedding dress cost a grand. Therefore being as reasonable as you can be with costs. \n\nYou did the right thing talking to your mom, being transparent about the need to double the order. Also setting boundaries is important and disinviting your sister, thereby eliminating drama, is essential. View your wedding as a people filter.\n\nIf you wanted to ease your emotional position, you can tell your mom that you recognise from your sister's outburst that your mom may not have been fully honest about how comfortable she was with the doubling of the order and you'll cover the increase but say that it doesn't mean your sister is reinvited because you don't need any additional drama in your life right now.", "NTA. You asked your family. They said yes. If you didn\u2019t ask they\u2019d think fianc\u00e9es family is trying to show them up / leave them out. \n\nYour sil should be cut off for speaking to you like that. My in-laws made excuses all the time for a sil\nWho treated us in a similar way. In 2021 I put my foot down after 10 years of verbal abuse and cut her off. We don\u2019t see her son or allow him to come to events involving our kids as it\u2019s a full cut off. Collateral damage but we had to sever the toxic limb to save the marriage.", "NTA.

I think she's surprised, as am I, that you and your partner make $170k/yr and are choosing things that are budget friendly to your income but being complete moochers of your parents. Your dad took a second job to afford their vacation and your wedding. They're trying to pitch in and even though your mom assured you it was ok, you should have known better and paid the difference yourself. \n\nGranted you're all adults and she agreed and you took her up on it so it's technically not your sister's place. But if this were my brother doing this to our parents, I would have likely had the same discussion as she had but maybe not let it get as heated. \n\nPlease consider that your parents deserve to have a life and shouldn't be taking on additional work so you can have your dream wedding. You make plenty as a couple and can shoulder more of the costs and if you can't, you should consider getting second jobs, not your dad. \n\nEdited: thanks to the people who corrected me on what both set of parents contributed! I did get it mixed up.", "NTA Unlike most, I read your comments and explanations. I know many people like your dad, who like to stick to their budget and never touch savings.

Awful.", "Soft YTA, here\u2019s why- my parents are incredibly generous parents. God, they love so hard, and my sister and I are the luckiest. The thing is, as a kid I didn\u2019t realize, but I sure as hell do now, that they would bend over backwards to give us things we want (still do). I don\u2019t need it, neither does my sister. But my parents always offer. They insist they are all good, they WANT us to have x, y, z. Anytime I say, \u201coh I\u2019m unhappy with this,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m saving up for that\u201d their knee-jerk response is \u201clet us help! I\u2019m putting some money in your account!\u201d But the thing is, they DONT have money like that. They aren\u2019t rich, just SUPER loving and giving.\n\nI get this. I refuse everything, I even edit what I say around them because I want my dad to be able to retire some day soon. I need them to think about themselves. \n\nMy sister DOES NOT GET IT. She accepts everything. And when I say \u201chey, you\u2019re a lawyer, don\u2019t let mom and dad pay for xxx\u201d, she always gets frustrated and responds \u201cthey offered!\u201d \n\nThis drives me nuts, because at some point, we have to wake up and look out for them! Their generosity knows no bounds, but if we love them at all, we should wake up and realize they are taking the shirts off their own backs when we have a closet-full!\n\nYour sister sounds like she is trying to protect your parents from their own generosity. Wake up, you\u2019re 6 -figure adults.

All the while knowing I would have to make serious serious cut backs to accommodate their wishes/choices.\n\nI think it's shitty of you to even ask them. Especially when you knew they were saving for a holiday, you knew your father was already working a second job. Believe me your dad isn't doing it for fun. He's doing it to be able to afford things. Whatever those things are, your father doesn't have the money to throw around so HAD to get another job. If you can afford it just bloody pay for it. Offering to offset the cost or whatever is bs. You probably knew they wouldn't refuse you and you asking them if they can afford it would impact their pride and feel as though you thought poorly of them.

She might have had some insight for you that has been lost.", "NTA, this doesn\u2019t have to do with your sister, so she is out her place, but I do agree with some comments here that you should have just paid the difference and not ask the parents.

Your Dad works a second job to cover \"luxuries,\" which indicates money is somewhat tight in your parents' home. You sister overheard your parent/s complain and was upset on their behalf. Instead of handling the entire issue with grace, you go nuclear and go NC.\n\nI think you should have paid the overage on the desserts, you could more than afford it.

When they offered to pay why didn\u2019t you just give them some fictional \u201cprice\u201d that would make them feel like they were contributing and then just foot the rest of the cost yourself?  And you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have even asked them to pay double what you originally quoted.

I get it; they offered to pay, wanted to be involved. Your sister jumped in without looking and started the drama, albeit under the impression of helping your parents. Everyone kinda gets some blame here. Your parents don\u2019t need to be offering anything if they\u2019re running low on funds in general. Nothing at all wrong with saying \u201chey we can\u2019t financially help but we can help in other ways.\u201d But I get their side too. They\u2019re your parents and want to do what they feel is right/best. But let them know there is zero shame on not making monetary offers. \n\nCut the source of the problem and give the $ back and move on. Pay for it yourselves and let it be.

Should never have said anything to your parents.", "YTA for kicking your sister out of your wedding and need to fix that because it\u2019s a much bigger issue for your parents than the double order of cupcakes which is none of your sisters business. How much money you make, your parents make, her parents make etc doesn\u2019t matter. Your parents are giving you a nice gift with the rehearsal and desserts. Its what they can afford, they are contributing in a way that they want to which most parents like to do. Not allowing them to do that would be unkind so you are not greedy or awful.

I don't know your cultural background and even within a culture, there are white people who can't say no and Chinese kids who will. \n\nBut something is clearly wrong when your sister is coming out swinging over the dessert order.

Combined we make about 170k a year. We decided on a place that is perfect for us to get married at and never expected anyone to help because, 1 we chose a place that fits our budget and 2, it\u2019s ultimately our day and what we want so we planned on paying for it ourselves. Now my fianc\u00e9s parents make more then my family does. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s parents offered to help in any way they can and have paid for stuff without us even asking. They paid for our bridal shower, which included the gifts, the food, and the rental spot. They also paid for her dress which was about 1k. My parents volunteered to pay for the rehearsal dinner and the dessert. We chose a place for the dessert and gave my parents a price. We chose to do cupcakes and just a little 2 tier cake from a popular bakery called everything bundt cakes. Well when we went to place the order we found out the \u201cbundtinis\u201d are really small and decided maybe we should double the order. I called my mom and she confirmed it was ok even though the price was doubled. I asked her if she was sure because they were planning a trip to Mexico at the time and my dad was working a second job to be able to afford it. I told my mom I don\u2019t care if she wanted to do something else because of the price change but she reassured me it was fine. So we placed the order and thought that was that.\n\nNow on to the issue, a few days after we placed our order I get a text from my sister saying we need to talk. So I texted back asking what was up. She goes on this huge rant saying I need to stick up for my parents because they work so hard for what they have and me deciding to double the dessert order what\u2019s bullshit. I tried explaining to her that our parents agreed to it and reassured me it was fine. It wasn\u2019t like I told my parents this is what we are doing and you don\u2019t have a choice. My sister started calling my fianc\u00e9 a cry baby and me and ungrateful bitch. I told her if she kept it up she will be uninvited to our wedding because I will not put up with the way she is talking to us. She said fine take me out because I\u2019m done with you and you won\u2019t see your niece ever again. There was a lot more choice words that were said that I won\u2019t get in to but my fianc\u00e9 was upset and crying and I won\u2019t stand for that. I have completely cut my sister off and have not talked to her since. I didn\u2019t have a conversation with my dad and a lot of tears were shed between us. I haven\u2019t talked to my mom because she makes excuse after excuse for my sister as to why she acts the way she does.

If I know I\u2019m about to change an order and someone\u2019s already paying for it the original order I should probably tell them what\u2019s going on with the original order and why that won\u2019t be able to get it and why we have to double up it would be weird if they didn\u2019t so instead when they got to the wedding that there was more than the original order and that he bought it instead so they would be upset even more, because not only did he lie about it to was he felt that we were too poor to pay for the other order of the Bundt cakes", "Thank you for spelling that out because reading comprehension is apparently a huge issue in this discussion. It is seriously exhausting reading comments from so many people who failed to understand or maybe didn\u2019t bother to fully read the post. Your comment needs to be much higher up. \nNTA", "So you want your father to give up his hobbies so you can impress your friends with pastries. Good for you.", "Doesn't change the situation. Op isn't more responsible for his parents or something because he's a guy.", "You are so dramatic. He didn\u2019t randomly double the order. He said they had a lengthy discussion about it and his mom said no problem.", "How would they know if they are only paying for it, and I assume, OP is ordering?", "Yes, 'cause that's exactly what OP has repeatedly been saying in his post and comments. /s (in case it really needed to be pointed out)\n\nSweet Georgia, the density is heavy in here.", "True, which is why I also upvoted your comment.", "some people really have that urge to be taken care of I guess", "It's because they said working 2 jobs like it's being done to scrape by, when it's clear it's just to have extra fun money while it's still easy to do.", "What else she could say? No, honey, let's leave half of your guests without desserts?", "Sounds like the shit your sister has going on is maybe making her jealous that some of your parents money is going to you. She doesn't want you who doesn't need the help taking resources away from her.", "Did you read the post?", "Yeah, how would they know? If they asked, OP could just say, we last minute decided to order more bc of the sizing, and just did it last minute bc we didn't realize how small the portions are - or whatever. Thanks again for your contribution - it was really helpful and we really appreciate it. \n\nThere's always a way to frame things to make people feel good and skirt around difficult situations. You don't have to be fully blunt/truthful when you need to get around these issues. \n\nAlso, if OP's partner's family is contributing more - people can have some class and not explicitly state who is contributing what out of courtesy and respect!", "because they probably know how much is ordered since they\u2019re involved in the process. if they realize that OP doubled it and paid the difference, it\u2019s doubtful they would take it well", "I mean Nothing Bundt Cakes is a chain whose pricing is readily available. Its not a national secret and since they were involved in the original ordering they would know the price. It\u2019s going to be pretty obvious to the parents the difference between 1 and 200 mini cakes (especially if they are told it\u2019s ok to take 2). It\u2019s not like switching the fabric quality on your napkins where only you will know the difference.", "I\u2019m not dense. I\u2019m just not an entitled brat. Don\u2019t talk to your sister for calling you out.", "Lol, nobody works 7 days a week for fun. Especially in his sixties or fifties.", "No it\u2019s not. His parents are paying for the rehearsal dinner **and** the dessert for the wedding. That\u2019s how I read it in the OP, but since you\u2019re confused it\u2019s made very clear by OP\u2019s second edit. Though idk why it matters\u2026", "Op offered other options including covering the extra cost. They're adults. If they wanted to say no they could've. If they wanted op to choose something else they could've agreed to that when op offered. Why is a 60 year old not allowed to make their own financial decisions just because someone else overheard a small portion of a conversation and disagreed with 3 grown adults choice that they made together.", "I don't think people have issues with their parents to contribute or even fully pay for their wedding - it's just if they can!! If your parents CAN pay and WANT to - let them, unless there are weird conditions/drama. \n\nOP keeps getting defensive - when it appears his parents may not have tons of funds to cover this expense, since his dad works a second job as a senior. If you know your parents are strapped, politely decline or find some low-cost contribution. If indeed they can, but are complaining about it behind his back, and his sister is now aware - some drama has been created. \n\nAlso, kids are not always aware of their parent's finances. \n\nAnd no, 170K combined in a major city is not a lot. Not trying to be rude, but unless you have generational wealth and a leg up on student loans/a down payment from your parents- it's not that much. \n\nJust like you are making assumptions about people's finances, or not allowing your parents to pay for things - we are making assumptions of OP's story. \n\nAs for the sister, she may genuinely have a concern about the money her parents are using that they can't really afford. OR she is just full of drama.", "They are grown adults. Last-minute decisions/changes are made at weddings.", "I don't have a sister.", "I know so many people who retired and then found a full or near full gig that they like because they like being productive and a really fun retirement is expensive. 50s and 60s is not that old, a lot of people aren't ready to be retired at that age, though many retire from what they were doing to something they enjoy more. My mother in her mid 60s was retired long enough to vacation, lounge a couple months, then said it was boring as hell and found a job she loves that she couldn't have pursued pre-retirement.", "If you notice, he didn't talk to his father about price change. He talked to his mother, who is not working, staying at home, and possibly is not aware of father's financial situation. And it's his father who complained to his friend about the money. So why OP didn't talk to his dad? Who is actually making the money?", "He is not retired. He works full job and then on Sunday and Saturday as a driver.", "You don't know if the father was complaining or literally just talking to his friend about his son's wedding that he _the father_ is the best man for. The man that is also a grown adult. The grown adult that is close enough to op the he considers the man his best friend and chose him to be best man over his other friends. If he had any problem with it I'm sure he's grown enough and is in contact with his son enough that he could've told him if he was upset. \n\nWhen you're talking about someone's wedding that you're involved with to a friend it's normal for the topic of money spent to come up, especially as a parent of the couple. That does not mean he was complaining. It's more likely he was just saying oh this is what I'm paying and what it's for.", "Why are you assuming that his mother is not aware of *their* financial situation? I don't know about yours or your parents relationships, but my mother can most definitely make financial decisions for my parents' household regardless of who makes the money! If I ask something from one of my parents, it is like I asked both of them. They can answer right away or they tell me they need to talk to the other parent first. But it is completely their choice on how to make decisions in their relationship."]}
