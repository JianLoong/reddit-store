Also if you and sister appear at my wedding, then I will call security.\" Then move on with your life. NTA", "NTA. Cut them out. Why bring back the trash?", "I suggest you say no, if your mom really wants to have a relationship she will stay in touch with you if she doesn't want to have a relationship with you it's better for you to get away from a toxic relationship like that and you never know maybe she will go no contact for a month then she'll want to be there at that special moment in your life.", "NTA, \n\nIgnore them OP....", "You don't owe amulet an explanation as to why you don't want her as your MOH. It's your wedding.  NTA", "I don't quite understand why you are keeping your sister in your apartment when she owns a lot of money. Especially if she seems to be the Main Character in everything.", "NTA and please go NC with them.", "NTA. Go NC with this wicked sister(who sounds like she needs a psych eval along with your mother) and your mother. Everything you described about them is truly toxic. Change all the locks in your house, get security cameras, stop giving her money, etc., it\u2019s your wedding and you and your fianc\u00e9 get to decide how you want it, not someone else, and clearly your sister doesn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere near it.", "Thank you for providing more clarity.  It's always painful to pull away from your family...  those connections are so deep and pervasive it's hard to sever them, even if your family mistreats you.  In this case it's particularly bad, because your mother is holding your little nieces hostage.\n\nThing is...  everything has a limit.  There's only so many times your family can kick you before you start to shy away from them.  It sounds like you are hitting that limit now.  While the internet advice you get is pretty blase about cutting family off, forgetting that it hurts now matter how justified, there comes a point where you pretty much have to.\n\nI'll light a candle for you and your nieces!", "I think the \"run\" needs to be all caps for extra emphasis to be honest because in this situation I definitely feel it's needed.", "Honor your brothers memory by following in his footsteps. They lie, steal, destroy your things and try to ruin you relationship with your fianc\u00e9. They cause you so much anxiety etc that your eating disorder and general mental health is better when they are not in your life!! \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them a relationship at such a great personal cost to yourself.", "NTA, but she gave you a way out. She won\u2019t be maid of honor and they will leave you. Win win.", "You don't need to justify this to us. It's your wedding and you can pick whoever you want. From the evidence you should dump your mother in particular- she is trying to emotionally manipulate you with your sisters health as a weapon and that's unacceptable.\n\nSister had not complained to you - yet?", "YWNTBA\n\nIf your mom wants to make that choice, let her. Best to set that boundry now that you will not let her bully you in to doing what she wants. Remind her that it was her that wanted to heal the relationship, and that if she wants to throw it away, you will be hurt, but you would rather be hurt than used and manipulated. \n\n>My mom always said that no one will be there for me like family, which is why I think I am being the asshole.\n\nYeah, no one but your family, your sister, stole your car and totaled it, nor tried to sleep with your fiancee, nor begs your for money while making more than you. \n\nAlso, think about him. How would he feel about having the chick who made passes at him in his own home being a central part of the wedding?", "NTA. Please go back to NC and don't have any of those messy people at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nYour mother and your sister are your drug and you have relapsed into them. You were doing better without them, go back to that.", "NTA.  Got to love family blackmail. NC is calling you. Leave these manipulative people behind and be happy.", "NTA. OP, take the chance and get them out of your life for good.", "NTA. OP run!!! You've already gone NC with them soooo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f good riddance.", "That little threat of sending her back to inpatient over this is pathetic. At what point does she take accountability for her actions? NTA", "Ditto.  I was wondering where the downside was.", "Exactly what I said", "\"Problems?\"\n\nAs opposed to having your car totaled, your sister's 'revenge' fashion shows, your fiance potentially not being your fiance anymore?  Those weren't problems??\n\nHoney, you do this and as a commenter already noted, you ain't getting married because your fiance will LEAVE you!!!!!!  This isn't an if, it's a when and he already knows what your sister is like so its likely sooner rather than later.  If fact, I would count on it happening the minute you definitively say your parents are invited.\n\nNTA for the title of the post but SOOO YTA for even considering letting your family back into YOUR life."]}
