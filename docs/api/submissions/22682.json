I want to start planning so that we are prepared and I am thinking of who I want to include in our wedding party. I really want my best friend, we will call her Allie (25F) to be my maid of honor. \n\nHowever, I have a twin sister who has a history of mental health issues. She is also my mom\u2019s favorite. I went no contact with my mom and sister after my sister told me that she was happy my brother died so that our parents could pay more attention to her and they\u2019d have more money to spend on her. \n\nI was no contact with them for about three years and then my niece was graduating from college and I flew out to her graduation. (By this time I had moved with my fianc\u00e9 from Nevada to Michigan for his work). My mom begged for me to try and heal our relationship, especially since my dad is now having health issues as well. \n\nSince then my Sister randomly showed up at our house because she \u201cCould not stand our parents anymore\u201d and she stayed at my house for roughly two months, performing \u2018fashion shows\u2019 for my fianc\u00e9 in lingerie and barely there dresses for her dates asking for his opinion. He would just do a thumbs up or thumbs down and then when I got home from work he told me she had to leave because he was uncomfortable with her in our house and did not like her bringing men into our house, as well, she borrowed my car while visiting and totaled my car. She did not have permission to borrow my car, and had my dad pay for the repairs. I ended up having to buy a new car because the car just kept breaking down afterwards. \n\nWhen she went back to my parents house she called and texted me non stop about how she hates living with my parents and is very depressed. Her and my mom smoke weed together at least twice a week. Which my mom threatened to kick me out of the house multiple times for and drug tested me multiple times for even thought I never smoked weed until my 21st birthday. Which is another reason I do not want her as my maid of honor. My sister was also hospitalized for mental health issues (72hr hold) when she went back to Nevada. I have offered to help my sister find an apartment, or house to rent as she makes 60k a year, (20k ish more than me) even though she keeps asking me for money. She says she can\u2019t afford a place to rent, especially with her dog. \n\nMy mom says I am an asshole for not wanting my sister to be my maid of honor, and that my sister is really upset about this. My mom says that they might need to rehospitalize my sister over this and that if my sister can\u2019t be my maid of honor then they are not going to the wedding and blocking me from all family events.  \n\nTL:DR: My sister and I don\u2019t get along, but my mom is forcing me to make her my maid of honor.
