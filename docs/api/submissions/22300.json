It's cool that you will still be nearby and can hang out, but this situation is for the best. Just say no and embrace your new surroundings.", "NTA. She didnt even ask or assume you would get moved.

The reality is you\u2019d probably be better off with your new roommate instead of your friend. Sometimes friends are best as friends, not roommates. And friendships can be ruined when you live together."]}
