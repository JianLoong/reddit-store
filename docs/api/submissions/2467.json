He said that it's because since their mother died recently that he feels a stronger urge to baby her and to protect her and to make sure that she's ok and happy.

Tickling and chasing each other around and stuff? For anyone who hasn\u2019t, the best way to describe it is \u201cicky.\u201d\n\nThat was television. Two healthy adult siblings spoon feeding each other is real life. And it would 100% make most people uncomfortable. \n\nOP didn\u2019t ask her brother to stop or fix the behavior, just be mindful of doing it when she is around because it makes her uncomfortable. This seems like a reasonable way to approach the situation. She\u2019s only brought up how it affects her, no more, no less.

It's a straightforward, reasonable boundary to follow.", "Does he feed her entire meals, or just a few bites here and there. If they were chilling on a couch and he pops a chip or cracker in her mouth, or a spoonfull of what he is eating then ok, a little odd but thats not horrible.

It's super weird.", "NTA- This is weird, do you know why he does that ? Are their parents okay with them doing that?

It would make me uncomfortable, too. NTA", "NTA, That is sooooo creepy.  Not normal,  not normal,  not normal.   I couldn't be around someone who acted like that.  Ewwwww \ud83e\udd22", "NTA but you will become one if you keep pressing the issue. The feeding sounds super creepy, but if that's what they want to do, it's their choice. Your responsibility if you can't stand it is to remove yourself from the situation if it happens again, rather than asking them to change (unless it's in your house, then you can make them stop or leave). Otherwise though, you can't force them to change something that is technically not wrong. It's up to you if you'd rather learn to live with it, but I don't think I could!", "My only concern is this kind of thing may escalate.

I think if he\u2019s otherwise perfect it could be worth it to try to get over, but personally I think it\u2019s creepy and wouldn\u2019t stay. He\u2019s not doing anything objectively \u201cwrong\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to live with it either.", "INFO - When you're talking about feeding them, are you meaning like buying and cooking them meals, or are you speaking more on the child-like level of feeding them manually, like spoon-feeding them? If they're just buying/cooking them food once in a while I don't see a problem with it, but if they're going to *that* level, then that's a seriously strange behavior; to which I'd definitely say there's some boundary issues there that need to be addressed.", "NTA. Boundaries!!", "He doesn't really do things like that with me?\nDo you want him to spoon feed you also~are you jealous?", "Ewww gross gross gross gross, sorry op but if I walked in and this was happening I would be walking right back out", "NAH.\n\nThat is super weird. Your not an asshole for asking, but I also don't know what is going on in their heads. It could be an innocent but unhealthy coping mechanism for both of them, or it could be a lot of things I just don't know.\n\nBut I think anybody would ask them to stop doing that so your not an asshole.", "This sounds like an inappropriate sibling relationship. My kiddo is 5.5 yo and I\u2019m annoyed we still have to feed her. (She has health issues we are working really hard on and is considered failure to thrive. Just diagnosed with celiacs and may have cardiac problems) Here is my point. It\u2019s not developmentally appropriate for us to still be feeding a 5.5. yo. It\u2019s highly inappropriate for him to be hand feeding her.", "3 months ago your boyfriend was 29. Is it a habit of yours to make stuff up?", "INFO: Do you have functioning legs and the ability to walk away when you see something you don't personally like?", "It's weird but inoffensive. You had been with him for 2 years, why is now a problem?", "YTA. Apparently never lost your parents. There are no rules for grief.", "YTA. I mean, sure, it's weird. It may be creepy, but why does it have anything to do with you? Provided that she's fine with it, then that's their thing. People are weird, but as long as they're happy, then let them be.\n\nEdit: I don't get why people are trying to shame these siblings. They're not hurting anyone. Some people here brandish therapy as a way to mold weirdos. A behavior is unhealthy if it's prone to cause suffering. If they're happy and comfortable with it, then that's no business for a therapist. Therapy is meant to help you be comfortable with who you are, not to shame you for what you enjoy.\n\nBoundaries? You don't get to put boundaries between two other people. You get to put boundaries when it involves you. It has become unacceptable, rightfully so, to shame a woman for breastfeeding in public or two men for kissing. \"I'm uncomfortable with it, so I'm putting a boundary.\" No! What these siblings are doing is even tamer than that, there isn't any partial nudity involved. They are just doing their thing quietly to themselves and you think you have to stop them. That's not putting boundaries, that's being a busybody.\n\nI think the main issue for most people here is alluded to in some comments. You see some weird behavior between siblings and you immediately think of incest, which makes you extremely uncomfortable.

It's then up to the other person if they want to respect this boundary.\n\nWhy is breastfeeding a false equivalent? If a baby isn't bottle-fed, there's no other way the child can eat. Babies need milk. There may be an instance where a parent can't move into another area with their child, so neither the mother nor anyone opposed to seeing breastfeeding can do anything about it. OP's boyfriend is feeding his teenage sister, who does not need to be spoonfed. It is very unusual, and it may be an unhealthy coping mechanism. OP's boyfriend seemed to agree not to feed his sister in front of OP, but he did it anyway, allegedly without thinking. You're comparing apples to oranges by bringing up breastfeeding."]}
