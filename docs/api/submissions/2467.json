Some people here brandish therapy as a way to mold weirdos. A behavior is unhealthy if it's prone to cause suffering. If they're happy and comfortable with it, then that's no business for a therapist. Therapy is meant to help you be comfortable with who you are, not to shame you for what you enjoy.\n\nBoundaries? You don't get to put boundaries between two other people. You get to put boundaries when it involves you. It has become unacceptable, rightfully so, to shame a woman for breastfeeding in public or two men for kissing. \"I'm uncomfortable with it, so I'm putting a boundary.\" No! What these siblings are doing is even tamer than that, there isn't any partial nudity involved. They are just doing their thing quietly to themselves and you think you have to stop them. That's not putting boundaries, that's being a busybody.\n\nI think the main issue for most people here is alluded to in some comments.

But it just doesn't seem like a healthy relationship.", "Sometimes it is offering a bite like, \"try this\" and \"its good right?\" And I've also witnessed him feed her practically a whole meal in front of his family", "I would be so weirded out if my brother even offered a sample off his spoon haha. Like.. bro I will take my own sample thank you very much.\n\nThis is super creepy.", "Buuuut let\u2019s not forget that the Lannister twins were a secret while Aegon and his sister wives were open about it. So Lannister might fit in this case, just hope the bf doesn\u2019t push the gf out the window for witnessing it", "That beat was dropped hard", "Can yall stop with this? \"Not fully developed\" doesn't mean you still have the mentality of a 2 year old.\n\nShe's almost 18. 18 is legally an adult in the entirety of the world.", ">YTA for not helping her.\n\nWhat do you expect OP to do?", "Yes perfectly healthy", "I don't really see the difference between them", "Yeah, the former seems fine to be. But the latter...yeah not so much. If she were a toddler sure, but she's 17??? Yikes.", "Uhm yeah a whole meal is weird as hell. I have a hard time believing that wouldn't make everyone that witnessed it uncomfortable, not just you as the partner. You're definitely NTA for thinking that's weird. And I also read your other comment about how he comes to YOU for affection when SHE rejects him? That's weird!! I guess it's up to you on if you can get passed your partner par-dating his sister...", "It's one thing if it's offering a taste or bite, but it's another when meals are fed like that. Definitely weird in my books.", "Run, dude. If he's done it in front of the whole family and no one has called him out there are some funky norms happening and I don't think you want to be a part of them.", "He needs therapy.", "Ew.  Yea, that\u2019s creepy.", "I agree, but in fairness...this man is spooning his sister right in front of his significant other. \n# dadjokes\n# imsorry", "OP may wanna stick to one-story buildings.", "Lol. I hate how many people excuse shitty behavior with that line. \n\nNah, she's 17. She should understand how to feed herself.", "OP is an adult. The sister is a minor. OP should talk to the sister privately to see what she thinks about her brother's behavior. Is the brother only telling OP that he's looking for hugs from her because his sister wouldn't hug him, or is he saying that to his sister too? If he's using OP to pressure his sister to show him physical affection, that's a problem. She could also ask her if any of her friends' siblings spoon feed them. His behavior isn't normal, and someone needs to point that out to her.", "Well then you're NTA", ">Can someone ask that question? Well, yes. They're probably a misogynistic prude\n\nSo it's ok if I ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of me, but I would be an asshole for doing it? That does not appear to be very consistent. Either it's ok to put that boundary or it is not.\n\nBecause, to me, a misogynistic prude is definitely an asshole and it is not ok to behave like one.\n\nSo, alright, we disagree about breastfeeding. To me, it is definitely not ok to ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of you.\n\n>There may be an instance where a parent can't move into another area with their child, so neither the mother nor anyone opposed to seeing breastfeeding can do anything about it.\n\nI would posit that such an instance is extremely rare. It is almost always possible for either the mother and her child or for the person uncomfortable to move to the next room over.\n\nI claim they shouldn't have to, but... impossible? No.\n\n>It's then up to the other person if they want to respect this boundary.\n\nAgain, you're being very unclear. They can choose to respect your boundaries or not? So, according to you a misogynistic prude can put a boundary, ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of them, and that woman would not be an asshole for disrespecting that boundary? Then that's not a boundary...\n\nMy view on this is that you have no right to put a boundary on a woman not to breastfeed in front you. You would be an asshole for trying to do it and she would not be an asshole for disregarding such inane \"boundary\".\n\nSeeing that this example doesn't work for you. Let's say I'm uncomfortable with two men kissing. If I put a boundary and tell them they are not allowed to kiss in front of me. Am I being an asshole? Would they be assholes if they then told me to fuck off and kissed anyway?", "I think that's a shame that you haven't experienced platonic sharing of food so you can't see the difference between that and when it's sexual. \n\nTrust me there's a massive difference, I would never feed my family members the way I'd share food or feed my partner. The feelings and the way you share food is just different, obviously him having a taste of food is different. But if I'm feeding him, it's not the same at all. \n\nDo you hug your family members? There's a difference in the hugs you give family vs your boyfriend. You have the normal hugs then you have the hugs that are for your partner. \n\nIf you don't see a difference and you are sexualising them, it's important your boyfriend knows that you're sexualising the way they interact. But right now it might be a bad thing to do as they're grieving, and no one else other than them will understand the grief they're feeling right now because it's their mum they've lost. \n\nYou're allowed to have boundaries, but some boundaries I wouldn't want to voice if they're due to cultural issues. \n\nI'm glad I've grown up in an environment where sharing food isn't sexual and is seen as a way to show eachother you care and love eachother. But if you're viewing them feeding eachother the way I'd feed my boyfriend and not the way I'd feed a family member, then I get why you'd have an issue. It's just a shame because I wish you could experience the same feeling of being fed by a loved one when it isn't sexual at all.", "Yeah I had to read it again to make sure the age was 17 (teenager) and not 17 months old.", "I'm 31, youngest sibling, and if my sister, who is 5 years older, hell, any of my older sisters tried to spoon feed me while I sit there with my hands placidly in my lap...\n\nmy god the idea is so hilariously weird to me, I can't imagine this ever happening short of physical disability or something\n\nWe offer each other bites of our dishes at times, but never fork to mouth. Always cutting off a piece and giving it to them to eat when they want.", "# \nsorrynotsorry lmao the dad jokes are fine, my hubby told dad jokes before he even became a dad.\n\nYeaaaaaah this just screams something is wrong here. I mean yeah I offer my little brother food when we do dine together but I typically put it on his plate since he is 21. The heck is this person doing spoon feeding a 17 year old? Even GOT got more sense then this", "And OP's bf might want to stick to sexual partners with whom he doesn't don't share chromosomes. \n\nWe don't always do what's good for us.", "And what if they do point it out?\n\nWhat happens then?\n\n>His behavior isn't normal, and someone needs to point that out to her.\n\nIt was pointed out.\n\nAgain what do you think the outcome of this will be?", "I feel like you\u2019re being deliberately obtuse now.", "I don't think that there is anything wrong with both of us having different perceptions on this subject. I have shared food with my siblings but its more separated like placing food on the side for them to grab from or try. I don't spoon feed them because it's not appropriate. I believe that it goes by age. With little kids yeah I share my with my cousins but I use a different spoon or different cup. I appreciate that you shared your experience with me and yeah it also depends how you grew up but I don't think it's a shame that I haven't experienced it", "If I saw any 20 something man doing this to his teenage sister, I'm just waiting for Chris Hansen to come in and ask him to take a seat"]}
