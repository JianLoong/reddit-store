Some people here brandish therapy as a way to mold weirdos. A behavior is unhealthy if it's prone to cause suffering. If they're happy and comfortable with it, then that's no business for a therapist. Therapy is meant to help you be comfortable with who you are, not to shame you for what you enjoy.\n\nBoundaries? You don't get to put boundaries between two other people. You get to put boundaries when it involves you. It has become unacceptable, rightfully so, to shame a woman for breastfeeding in public or two men for kissing. \"I'm uncomfortable with it, so I'm putting a boundary.\" No! What these siblings are doing is even tamer than that, there isn't any partial nudity involved. They are just doing their thing quietly to themselves and you think you have to stop them. That's not putting boundaries, that's being a busybody.\n\nI think the main issue for most people here is alluded to in some comments.

No.\n\n>It's then up to the other person if they want to respect this boundary.\n\nAgain, you're being very unclear. They can choose to respect your boundaries or not? So, according to you a misogynistic prude can put a boundary, ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of them, and that woman would not be an asshole for disrespecting that boundary? Then that's not a boundary...\n\nMy view on this is that you have no right to put a boundary on a woman not to breastfeed in front you. You would be an asshole for trying to do it and she would not be an asshole for disregarding such inane \"boundary\".\n\nSeeing that this example doesn't work for you. Let's say I'm uncomfortable with two men kissing. If I put a boundary and tell them they are not allowed to kiss in front of me. Am I being an asshole?

The feelings and the way you share food is just different, obviously him having a taste of food is different. But if I'm feeding him, it's not the same at all. \n\nDo you hug your family members? There's a difference in the hugs you give family vs your boyfriend. You have the normal hugs then you have the hugs that are for your partner. \n\nIf you don't see a difference and you are sexualising them, it's important your boyfriend knows that you're sexualising the way they interact. But right now it might be a bad thing to do as they're grieving, and no one else other than them will understand the grief they're feeling right now because it's their mum they've lost. \n\nYou're allowed to have boundaries, but some boundaries I wouldn't want to voice if they're due to cultural issues. \n\nI'm glad I've grown up in an environment where sharing food isn't sexual and is seen as a way to show eachother you care and love eachother. But if you're viewing them feeding eachother the way I'd feed my boyfriend and not the way I'd feed a family member, then I get why you'd have an issue.

I tried to get this need from him and when he rejected me, I would cuddle with my dog instead.

I can\u2019t imagine it feels great when that happens.\n\nDoes the feeding behavior seem to be something he does to her without her necessarily asking for or wanting him to do so? Or does she insist he does it? If the former then I think one way to try to reexplain how strange this behavior is, is to let him know that by doing this he is infantilizing her and potentially harming her ability to mature and grow and become an independent person. That if he wants her to succeed and cares so much about her well being he needs to stop treating her like a child because it will do more harm than good.\n\nHopefully by framing this behavior as actually inhibitive to her growth and negative for her well-being he will adjust. That being said, it\u2019s not ideal that he would need to know how it\u2019s negatively affecting his sister to stop, and that knowing it makes you uncomfortable isn\u2019t enough. \n\nHope you two can get through this and he can learn this isn\u2019t actually good for his sister, nor his relationship with you.", "Are you her mom or guardian raising her?

I see no understanding and compassion for them in this request for therapy and you would be lying if you said you did.\n\nThe second most upvoted comment is even less subtle and directly reference incest.
