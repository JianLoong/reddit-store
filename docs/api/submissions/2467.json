Some people here brandish therapy as a way to mold weirdos. A behavior is unhealthy if it's prone to cause suffering. If they're happy and comfortable with it, then that's no business for a therapist. Therapy is meant to help you be comfortable with who you are, not to shame you for what you enjoy.\n\nBoundaries? You don't get to put boundaries between two other people. You get to put boundaries when it involves you. It has become unacceptable, rightfully so, to shame a woman for breastfeeding in public or two men for kissing. \"I'm uncomfortable with it, so I'm putting a boundary.\" No! What these siblings are doing is even tamer than that, there isn't any partial nudity involved. They are just doing their thing quietly to themselves and you think you have to stop them. That's not putting boundaries, that's being a busybody.\n\nI think the main issue for most people here is alluded to in some comments.

They're probably a misogynistic prude\n\nSo it's ok if I ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of me, but I would be an asshole for doing it? That does not appear to be very consistent. Either it's ok to put that boundary or it is not.\n\nBecause, to me, a misogynistic prude is definitely an asshole and it is not ok to behave like one.\n\nSo, alright, we disagree about breastfeeding. To me, it is definitely not ok to ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of you.\n\n>There may be an instance where a parent can't move into another area with their child, so neither the mother nor anyone opposed to seeing breastfeeding can do anything about it.\n\nI would posit that such an instance is extremely rare. It is almost always possible for either the mother and her child or for the person uncomfortable to move to the next room over.\n\nI claim they shouldn't have to, but... impossible? No.\n\n>It's then up to the other person if they want to respect this boundary.\n\nAgain, you're being very unclear. They can choose to respect your boundaries or not? So, according to you a misogynistic prude can put a boundary, ask a woman not to breastfeed in front of them, and that woman would not be an asshole for disrespecting that boundary? Then that's not a boundary...\n\nMy view on this is that you have no right to put a boundary on a woman not to breastfeed in front you. You would be an asshole for trying to do it and she would not be an asshole for disregarding such inane \"boundary\".\n\nSeeing that this example doesn't work for you.

The feelings and the way you share food is just different, obviously him having a taste of food is different. But if I'm feeding him, it's not the same at all. \n\nDo you hug your family members? There's a difference in the hugs you give family vs your boyfriend. You have the normal hugs then you have the hugs that are for your partner. \n\nIf you don't see a difference and you are sexualising them, it's important your boyfriend knows that you're sexualising the way they interact. But right now it might be a bad thing to do as they're grieving, and no one else other than them will understand the grief they're feeling right now because it's their mum they've lost. \n\nYou're allowed to have boundaries, but some boundaries I wouldn't want to voice if they're due to cultural issues. \n\nI'm glad I've grown up in an environment where sharing food isn't sexual and is seen as a way to show eachother you care and love eachother. But if you're viewing them feeding eachother the way I'd feed my boyfriend and not the way I'd feed a family member, then I get why you'd have an issue.

They do weirdly intimate spoon feeding but she pulls away from physical affection from him. It's very concerning.", "As someone who is very much fine motor impaired? I still feed myself. I make messes but like... I am almost 40. There's tools for this for most of us. This has incest vibes to me. I don't say this lightly but it hits the trauma spots from forced infantilization and abuse (that else to my disabilities) in an effort to keep me vulnerable. NTA but uh wow also", "I'd say the dude and the sister are being creepy af.", "Heck, my 9 month old baby frequently takes the spoon away from me and tries to feed himself!", "I\u2019m a bit concerned over the bit about sister rejecting BF, so he goes to OP. Does sister even really want her brother to do this? Is he pushy and insistent on it?", "Yeah, but now I want to just *try* feeding my brother in front of our husbands, just to weird everybody out. \n\nExcept I know I would just start laughing and accidentally fork someone in the eye.", "This gives me the heebie jeebies. I\u2019ve been with my husband 11 years and usually if I\u2019m offering him a bite while cooking or of a different dish at a restaurant I just hand him the fork because it\u2019s easier. He has 3 younger siblings and I\u2019ve never seen him feed them. I\u2019m currently 35 years old and can probably count on my fingers the instances where anyone has tried to feed me since I got out of elementary school. \n\nBut the whole \u201cwhen she rejects his affection like hugs he comes to me for affection\u201d just sent me to a whole other dimension", "Love that! I\u2019ve definitely done the same for my parents while they\u2019re driving on road trips.", "What in the actual fuck? Is this real? I am so creeped out right now! Just why? And you came to Reddit to ask about it? Holy hell. Does he eat and then regurgitate into her mouth like a mommy bird and her baby, or feed her with a little dropper? This is seriously disturbing. Have fun with that. Jfc", "I\u2019m just very confused why he\u2019s literally spoon feeding a teenager who is capable of feeding herself. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA for doing it, it\u2019s just bizarre. And i think you\u2019re NTA for asking him not to do it around you, it\u2019s very weird to witness I wouldn\u2019t want to see it either", "NTA - Unless she has some sort of mental or physical problem, there is no reason for her to need someone to spoon feed her... That's honestly pretty disturbing.", "NTA that\u2019s took an unexpected turn", "Girl, RUN!", "I would file a Restraining order if my brother wanted to spoon me.", "I can't stop thinking of the episode of Friends where Danny, the guy Rachel is dating, has his sister visiting and she does things like feed him, tickle him and take a bath with him.", "That's your only concern?! Lol", "Why would you want to learn to deal with that?!", "Surprise, you're dating a Lannister.", "Then they both need therapy and you need to insist on it if you\u2019re going to stay with him.", "Run away, this is getting into GOT make him fly territory, a 17 year old should be able to feed herself and actually want to. This is weird on so many levels, that I wouldn't want to see what he does later.\n\nNTA", "I would just leave the establishment at that point", "She may not want him to feed her like a baby, but taking care of and pampering her.", "I suppose she more meant in a romantic way, ya know how it's shown in movies,where a couple feeds each other. I mean I sometimes feed my husband snacks, mostly when he's holding the baby and I really want him to try something, but still \ud83d\ude05", "Feeding each other morsels of food is an intrinsic part of flirting, especially as a component of dinner dates. It may lessen or disappear over time in long term relationships but it's normal and a very common aspect of tension building and the beginnings of intimacy in the first few dates.", "So his first resource for affection... is his 17 year old sister that he spoon feeds and babies? Ummm... he needs a therapist. And it ain't you. \n\nGirl, RUN.", ".... Are.... Are we absolutely sure?", "I found my friend Reddit like years ago because he was gloating he got gold from someone on Reddit. I randomly found it because he answered an ask Reddit question something about stories about creepy teachers. He even me mentioned our old highschool,I saw it had gold and I connected the two.", "In my culture, you spoon-feed people whoever you like, especially if they are family. It's considered a sign of love and care.", "Sounds like some weird sort of incestuous age play kink.", "Luckily for OP it sounds like her bf would be into tantrums.", "Yeah this is scary to read..", "OP wtf? Seriously wtf? \n\nPlease reconsider this relationship. This is extremely  inappropriate and concerning. Like really fucken not ok.", "I'm concerned that his family doesn't find this odd. Not only are you NTA, I think you really need to consider what a long term relationship with thus  would mean. If you want children, are his parents the type you'd ever want to leave your kids alone with if they didn't discourage this sort of inappropriate behavior?", "Reminds me of the episode of Friends when Rachel is dating Danny and he has is sister over and she's breaking up with him, starts reconsidering until she finds out they're about to have a bath together.\n\nNTA this is mad creepy, I have a brother I would st@b him with the fork in the hand before allowing this.", "I recommend letting him! Babies can do so much more than we give them credit for.", "I found that super concerning too.", "Yeah, I have two brothers and if either of them did that I\u2019d automatically assume something was seriously wrong. Like, they\u2019ve had a stroke or been replaced by pod people or something.", "This is the way.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t asking them to stop just not around you. I think he needs therapy though. If he does thing x and sister says no then he goes to you for fulfillment of thing x, it\u2019s a bit more than treating her like his baby. If she said no, the action should stop not be transposed onto someone else. He\u2019s going through something and needs professional intervention.", "Girl, RUN! This is enmeshment and it\u2019s a form of emotional incest. He\u2019s weird and so is she and it\u2019s probably hereditary so u don\u2019t want to procreate with these genes. Get yourself a real man who has boundaries and isn\u2019t a total weirdo.", "This is really creepy and you need to run far away.  There is nothing normal about what is happening.  \n\nHe's got some strange thoughts.  He may have been brought up really weird.  I'm concerned about an incestuous relationship - 'if she rejects his hugs, he goes to you..'  \n\nNope this is not a relationship that should go on any further.  And I'm not sure it needs to be reported to someone if you've seen or heard other stuff that's illegal.\n\nNTA - but it's not something that you should deal with or let go.  Unless the letting go is breaking off the relationship.", "\"Danny, hurry up, you're bath's getting cold.\" Yewww, yuk, yuk, YUK.", "Is it\u2026 like full meals? Or like \u201cHey, try this!\u201d", "Too much emo. Does your gut tell you this feels wrong? Go with that and just.. go.", "It is uncommon and certainly weird, but what exactly makes it creepy? Why is pointing out that the sister is a minor relevant? \n\nIt sounds like people project into a family dynamic something that likely isn't there, specifically some sort of sexually driven activity. \n\nFamilies have different practices even within the same cultural umbrella. This could just be a form of affection common to that family. Just like hugging or kissing, or holding, or cuddling is for some families. Just because it's different doesn't make it wrong.", "I have had family members feed me a single spoon/fork full of something - I have also done that with them. But I feel that's some what normal, a single bite and that is it. Anything more than that gets weird real fast.", "I thought the same thing.....\nThat it maybe akward to some people. \n& to others its perfectly normal.\nNo negativity is seen within it.\nUnless you have a Negative mind set.", "Yes my 14 months old insistence on feeding himself has made dinner time very messy and take forever.", "I think the difference really hinges on this line\n\n>when she rejects him; he comes to me.\n\nIf he's not interacting with his sister the way he would a partner, why is he transferring unreciprocated affection from his sister to his partner", "I DO IT, MOMMY!!! ... 2 yr old.", "As soon as my nanny kid understood spoon>food>mouth she refused to let me feed her. The washing got *intense* but it was worth it to see her pride in her independence.", "Agreed, I might PASS my sibling a fork of my food if they wanted to try it. I also fork-fed my older sister a few bites of her meal once because she was breastfeeding her newborn and her hands are full. But what you're describing? No, not normal and not appropriate. Sorry but it's weird af."]}
