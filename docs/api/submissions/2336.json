Husband and I were invited to his parents\u2019 house this past weekend. We arrive, FIL wasn\u2019t there. MIL sat us down and asked for $25,000. We were stunned, and asked why. She was equivocating, but we have a good idea since she was always irresponsible with money. He told me growing up she was a SAHM with a lot of free time so she\u2019d regularly spend hours at the expensive grocery stores and buy a lot of pricey groceries that they\u2019d eventually throw out. She still does this, I\u2019ve seen her buy 5 bushels of farmers market fruit NOT to eat, but bc she likes the smell. Then throw it out. She\u2019d lie about the cost of things, regularly treat her friends for dinners out etc. There are no secret vices, it\u2019s stuff like that that adds up. It was the source of all the conflict in the house. FIL put her on an allowance of sorts, so she opened up her own credit card, and here we are. My husband suggested therapy in the past (for all her issues), but seems like she won\u2019t go.\n\nProbably relevant that I make more money than husband which is why she brought me into it, she knows my husband doesn\u2019t have that kind of cash. Any way, this is where I may be an AH. So after our questions, my husband tells her we\u2019d have to think about it. I just blurted out, \u201cUhhhh no. Sorry but no. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d I was surprised by how blunt I was since our arms-length relationship is predicated on extreme politeness. \n\nHusband looked at me like, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d, and she looked wounded. \n \nAfter we left, he told me I should have let him deal with this, and I made her feel lower than she did. He said he wouldn\u2019t have given her anything unless we agreed. I mean, she asked me too, so\u2026 \n\nWas I the AH for shutting my MIL down like that?", "created_utc": 1668467834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvfyfk/aita_for_shutting_down_mils_request_for_money_to/", "score": 2590, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was pretty ballsy to make that kind of request. It deserved to not have any questions linger of if y\u2019all would help. Hubs might be upset. But it\u2019s probably going to be something he\u2019s thankful for down the road", "NTA-you were there, no way you give someone 25k, she can get another job if she wants more cash.", "NTA. Why give her false hope. She\u2019s not going to change and she doesn\u2019t want to. If you help you\u2019re just further enabling her to escape the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. From what you said, seems like MIL just wants a cash cow to pay off her irresponsibility. She should get a PT job and pay off her debts, or talk to FIL and come clean. It's not YOUR responsibility to pay her debts! If your Husband wants to use HIS OWN money, that's on him. But make sure your finances can handle that.", "NTA. If she's got the gall to spend money like it's going out of fashion, not listen to people trying to help her over time, then try to ask for it because of her bad habits, then yes, you have every right to be blunt with her.\nProbably won't do you want favours but these kind of people need to know boundaries for their own stupidity before they go too far.", "NTA. Could the situation have used more tact, yes. However telling her he\u2019d think about it, opens your husband up to be hassled for the money and guilted into giving it. And you dealing with the consequences. \n\nIf she brings it up again, demand FIL is in the room with you so he knows what she\u2019s asking", "NTA. Why hem and haw. The answer is no. What more is there to say. She should feel low. She\u2019s lying to her husband and begging for money.", "NTA I understand that your boyfriend wanted to handle this with velvet gloves, but it is enabling behaviour like his that got her in this predicament in the first place.\n\nThe fact she asked for it behind your father-in-laws back, shows she is not taking responsibility for her own actions.", "NTA and a definite no is better than we\u2019ll talk about it. And no freaking way in hell should you give her that much or any money, and her husband needs to know she asked", "NTA, I definitely think that face-to-face is the best way to handle this, so I don't understand how it could be deemed negative.  She asked both of you in person, so if you left it to your husband to deal with, you wouldn't get to say your piece.\n\nWhen you're talking about such a huge amount of money, blunt honesty is needed.  If there was a chance you would be able to, you could have taken the opportunity to ask her questions, sort out terms there and then.  but instead, it was not possible, so you nipped it in the bud immediately.\n\nIf she asked for less, or explained a serious issue, it would have been different.  But I would probably have blurted out the same thing.", "NTA and no issue with how you stated it very clearly. Who the hell just asks someone for 25k as though they\u2019re asking for a drink of water", "NTA\n\nYou need to shut that down as soon as possible.  Your hub leaving it open still has the same effect, just further down the line.", "NTA. She asked. You answered. She needs to learn She cannot keep asking people to help her dig herself out. She made her grave in debt. She can only get herself out. \n\nHim beating around the bush will only encourage her and make her think people will eventually help her. Standing your ground and locking that door behind you shows that neither of you will help her. Period.", "NTA. A request like that, when everyone knows how she handles her finances, needs a firm \"no.\" Maybe you were blunter than you meant to be, but your husband saying \"we need time to think\" leaves her room for interpretation. She can't expect other people to continue to fund her shopping trips, especially on wasting food, which is a whole other issue.\n\nEdit: changed word", "NTA.\n\nI mean sure you weren't particularly tactful about it, but there's not really a tactful way to ask for 25k either. I think that ask would stun most people into total honesty. Besides, she was blunt and upfront in her request, you matched that tone in your response. Seems to me that's plenty fair.", "NTA \u2026..  Will he give her it without your knowledge ?  Is this a possibility \u2026", "NTA. I would have said NO immediately too...", "NTA - it's very complicated when you are trying to say no. Sometimes there is no polite way.", "NTA with out the negative feedback this is never getting better, you give her the money she pays off cards and then boom right back to bull shit. You need to take away her soft landing so she faces reality which is exactly what you have done", "If someone wants a $25k loan, they should go to a bank.\n\nIf you give her any money at all, make sure you have her sign some sort of legally enforceable contract stating how much she gets and how she will pay it back and when.\n\nThat is a RIDICULOUS amount of money to ask for.\n\nNTA", "Not the asshole!!! The hero!!!\n\nEdited to say: I don\u2019t think more tact was needed. I bet MIL has a habit of stomping on DH and asking too much - how else could she possibly have the gall to make sure a request?!?! I think you saved him from misery, even if it hurt her (sorry, not sorry). Let them both be pissy - he\u2019ll thank you for it in a few days or whenever he comes out of the FOG (fear / obligation / guilt).", "NTA. It may be his mother, but she would have felt the same way getting the answer \"no\" either way. And honestly, it isn't like waiting until you left would change the answer. \n\nIt's a lot of money to ask family for. She should be asking a bank. Or, you know, getting her spending under control. That's not your issue. She needs to work on that herself.", "NTA\n\nThat's really the right way to completely shut down MIL. No is a complete sentence and leaves no room for misconceptions. \n\nGood for you! You have a shiny spine and firm boundaries!", "NTA .. no tact needed, uh Hell no.... but be warned your husband is going to try to back door it to her. People kill me wanting everything sugar coated\" Not going to happen ma'am\" is exactly what I would have said too...", "NTA..how was she going to pay it back? And while your response may have lacked \"tact\" sometimes being blunt  is best so that there is zero confusion. If hubby had said \"we'll let you know\" that may have gotten her hopes up and possibly went out and spent more.", "NTA. Does your FIL know that she has this credit card and is asking for a large sum of money? He really needs to be brought into the loop.", "NTA\n\nShe needed to be shut down immediately.  Asking for $100 for medication when it is an emergency and you run short?  Maybe.  $25,000?  Heck no.  Just no.", "NTA", "Eh, maybe you could have been more diplomatic about it. Even if you weren't considering it.", "I am going with NAH. She asked and you said no. If she keeps pushing it then that would change things. Personally I would have let my husband deal with it. Money and family is messy", "NTA for saying no to MIL\u2019s request. She has refused to learn the Life Lesson that one cannot spend more than one makes. She needs to experience the natural consequences of her actions. \n\nMaybe a little bit AH to your partner for overriding him so definitively and undermining your partnership.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that your SO was offended, but we\u2019re not talking about a couple of thousand dollars here. This is $25k that is a result of her spending addiction. Plus, SO doesn\u2019t have the income to pay for it, so it would be on you. That\u2019s a big ol\u2019 nope.", "NTA. It takes balls to ask for $25,000.", "NTA if you\u2019re not on board at all then why equivocate? She either was asking you or both of you for money. Regardless your agreeing was required and if it\u2019s a NO then why wait? Also that\u2019s no small amount. Woman needs help or maybe save that $25k for FIL if he needs a divorce atty", "NTA it was your place to deal with it because she brought you into it and irs mainly your money.", "NTA, but maybe talk things out with your s/o instead of blurting out the no. You were right to say no, but not right that second, maybe.", "Nta but since this is the first time I would have let him handle it. \n\nIf this was time 2 of her bugging then be harsh", "People have no tact anymore. N T A for saying no, but YTA for how you said it. Leave people with some dignity.", "YTA for how you reacted in that situation but NTA for saying no at a $25,000 loan\u2026I could pay my tuition off and then some with that kind of money", "NTA but you lack tact...", "YTA sorry, you should have talked with hubs first to present a united front. You didn't have to \"let him handle her\", but preemptively saying to no AT THE SAME TIME your husband is saying \"we will discuss it\" it's hella rude of you To Your Husband.\n\nThis is not about what you said to his mom.\n\n\nThis is about the fact that you didn't talk to your husband first and present a united front. Now your hubs is going to have to hear about why his wife doesn't like his mom, etc etc.\n\nGood job opening that can of worms. I suggest you apologize to hubs for not discussing with him first. Even if it was in the corner for 5 minutes.", "YTA, not to your MIL but towards ypur husband, I don't think it was with bad intent, and you shouldn't beat yourself to much for it", "You should have talked about it away from MIL before telling her no. I know you wanted to shut her idea of getting money from you down right away but you should have offered your husband the curtesy of at least having the conversation. The fact that you make more money is irrelevant in this. Lending the money would be a mutual decision.

She has a problem, and until she hits rock bottom she may never admit that the problem is her. She probably still thinks that the problem is the money, but it\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s her inability to control her spending. If you paid off her credit card for her, she\u2019ll be back within 6 months asking for another $25k.

Seems about time someone is driving the message across,..", "You mean \"She can get A job if she wants more cash\".\n\nOP said shw was a SAHM when the husband was young, but i don't see anything stating she is gainfully employed", "OP really needs to sit down with her husband or maybe he needs therapy to better understand how to deal with an addict. That's what his mom is, she is addicted to shopping and spending money. She won't stop unless she has a reason, many times they have to hit rock bottom and it's painful to watch someone fall like that, so many family members will give in and \"help\" but they are adding to the problem.\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong OP, it wasn't harsh enough IMO. NTA but good luck.", "Yyyyyyeah. I think I would burst out laughing from the sheer shock.", "So your husband is upset because you said no when he basically  said \"mom let me think about it, let me put the weight of this decision on my wife, let met think how to convince her so she says yes, let me put your problems on my wife, just because she has more money, of course I will ask her, but if we say no, it will really be my wife saying no, not me, because you know I love you more than I love my wife and i would totally help you cover for your irresponsible behavior with my wifes money\".\n\nI am sorry your husband is spineless and the \"I was going to ask you\" is basically letting you take the brunt of the problem. So since he was going to do that, and in the end it was going to be your decision, you had the right to answer right there. \n\nHe should have stopped his mom right in her tracks, did I read right? 25k debt? Because she throws things away and he thinks in any level or planet is OK to ask you to help with it? Red flag there.\n\nYou have a husband problem. He doesn't respect your assets. If he had said \"next time let me answer, of course we were not going to help her, I just wanted to put the problem off until I could have a private conversation with her\". He said instead \"of course I was going to ask you first\". Red flag!\n\nNTA. Be careful with your finances around him.", "She needs to file bankruptcy and go to therapy. Nobody should enable her by giving her any money.", "I would tell hubby that he has 2 days to tell FIL or I will. He deserves to know.", "This is a tough one. I can understand why you shut your MIL down clearly and decisively.  And I don't think you are wrong per se.  However, your husband said to you after that he had no intention of giving his mom the $ but that he preferred to deal with his mom.  Unless your SO has a history of not standing up to his parents or making rash $ decisions, then generally, I think it is best to let SOs handle thorny issues with their own families.  Ideally, you and your SO are in agreement and SO protects you from fallout by dealing with the issue directly with his family.  But it sounds like this request came out of left field so I can understand you reacting in the moment of shock and just saying no.  NTA to you and NTA to your spouse because he supported you by not contradicting you in front of your MIL and instead told you privately that his preference is to handle it in the future.", "NTA", "NTA absolutely Not your husband sounds like a push over.  If he could afford to do it on his own im sure he would have given it to her.", "NTA. His mother has spent herself into the poor house and expects you guys to bail her out. Time to take MIL and FIL to a financial consultant and lay all their finances out on the table. Tell them this is the only way you will even consider helping them.  Once you all see where they are sitting financially plans can be made where they have to start living in their means.  I would not be their retirement plan.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m always surprised when people think it\u2019s perfectly normal to sit you down and make such an uncomfortable and inappropriate request and then call YOU the rude one for shutting it down.", "NTA. She blindsided you. Set yall up without her husband present. Let her deal with it.", "YTA. You don\u2019t need to give her money, but yes you could have talked about and found a way to be polite. Your husband should have had a say on how to break it to her.", "NAH except your MIL\n\nAt one point, it was considered highly rude in Japanese business transactions to say \"no\" so they would say things like \"Perhaps at a later time\" or \"Not right now\" instead. But it wasn't really equivocation so much as politeness. It seems like that's what your husband was going for here.\n\nMIL: I need $25k.\nYou: Abso-fuckin-lutely not\nHubby: (whispered) *don't say that shit until we've escaped with our lives*\n\nBut I totally get your thinking. Don't give her false hope or subject yourself to more nagging.", "NTA. And you should let your father in law know. She might have taken out a card un his name. Either way her debt will effect him", "Not at all the AH. If more people spoke bluntly and honestly there would be way less people like your MIL.", "You should 100% make sure your finances are separate.", "NTA\nShe brought you into it,  she should be prepared for a no.", "Nta\n\nHold classes for the rest of the family to learn how to say no.", "Giving money to friends and relatives is the best way to ruin SOME relationships.\n\nFixed that for you.", "Wouldn't you want to know if your partner was racking up tens of thousands of debt?", "NTA. I do agree with your husband. You should have just left their home and let him be the one to tell her no. It's his mother and there's no doubt he would have been able to do it in a more productive way. That said, you've left it very clear where her financial problems are not going to go and I think that is very important as well. She needs to understand that any idea that involves her transferring her debt to you and your husband is an absolute nonstarter.", "NTA. Could you have been more tactful? Sure, but you\u2019re still NTA. Your husband wanted to try and spare his mother\u2019s feelings, and that\u2019s understandable, but I also understand wanting it to just be done and over.", "NTA. The way some people think about credit cards is really warped. If I have a line of credit for $25,000 and owe $20, 000, my thinking is that I OWE $20,000. For some other people though, they don't even think about how much they owe, they instead think, they have $5,000 free to spend! See the difference?", "NTA. \n\nThat your husband didn't immediately shut her down speaks volumes.", "ooh ooh so NTA. That's the dynamic in our relationship, I made more money then hubs and eventually we had a fight about her crazy (and she went nuts about it, asking for a crap ton then chastising him saying he was bragging about wealth). We eventually said no more money every to family. It saved our relationship. You cannot let her even think that's a possibility.", "NTA, and good on you for honesty!  That was a ridiculous ask anyway.  \n\nThe very worst thing you can do to a person with money troubles is give them money.  It\u2019s like throwing gasoline on a fire hoping it would put out the flames.", "NTA !!!!!! Your husband has got to get his priorities in line here. HE needs to deal with his family. The family survived prior to your marriage thus they will survive without trying to borrow money all the time!", "NTA. Nope.", "NTA.  So what plan did your husband have?  If he wasn't giving her the money then \"No\" was the right answer, right then.  He would have given in to her - he just doesn't want to admit it.", "You: NTA. \n\nBut I would make sure nothing gets done behind your back.", "NTA this was likely a knee jerk reaction and ultimately no matter how said it, if were kind of sympathetic or tried to get her to see the behaviour that got her there it wouldn\u2019t of mattered she\u2019d be upset that wasn\u2019t a yes. Some people can\u2019t handle credit cards. I realised I\u2019d find too tempting so my husband has one we use as he\u2019s just better with it. Sometimes have to own our weaknesses and take the temptations away", "I mean, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but maybe you could have been more tactful. Any amount of money is a huge ask, but that amount seems particularly large to just ask for as a gift, essentially. \n\nNext time maybe let your husband handle the actual turning down, as it sounds like that\u2019s more usual for your relationship, but you certainly aren\u2019t an asshole saying no.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA instead of no assholes because MiL seems to have purposefully tried to keep FiL out of the loop, which makes her an asshole imo.", "She declined to go to therapy but is perfectly happy asking for money to continue that practice. Give her a call and tell her that you are sorry for how you made her feel. Tell her you can't in good conscience give her money for a problem she is unwilling to talk to someone about. Apologize to your husband after making that call or talk to him about what you will say to her to see if he thinks it's a good idea.\n\nGet your FIL in on it to see what will happen if you all joined forces (not as in ganging up on her, but all with the same goal in mind. Getting her help.) Maybe a different approach will make her see things differently. NTA btw", "NTA- but I think the decision should have been thoroughly discussed with your spouse because your MIL has a spending problem. Your husband tell her so YOU didnt look like the solo bad guy and he could have included the FIL. He needs to know this.", "SIL did this with my mother. Gave her $10 to pay off secret debt and she stiffed her. 10000000% NTA.", "NTA.  Your husband's approach actually would have been much worse.  He wanted to give his mom hope that she would be getting the money, and then she'd feel even more let down when he eventually told her 'no'.  You were swift and to the point.  Not going to happen.  The fact that MIL hasn't changed her spending habits, at all, means this would be a recurring request, so good for you for shutting it down.", "NTA why let her think that an ask like that is something you would even entertain? Absolutely not. You got yourself into the mess now dig yourself out. When people who are irresponsible with money rarely become responsible when others bail them out.", "NTA.  I was once $34,000 in debt and even I don't think you should give her the money.  I did pay back every cent, but it was helped out by some distributions of my mom's money before she died.\n\n  I pay off cc's in full every month, but sometimes still spend too much.  Giving her any money would just enable her.", "YTA, it is his mother, he should have told her. Tou should have at least had the conversation with him.\n\nInstead, you made him look subordinate and embarrassed him.\n\nTo be clear, totally ok not to give MIL money, your the AH for how you handled it."]}
