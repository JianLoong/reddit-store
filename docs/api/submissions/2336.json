Husband and I were invited to his parents\u2019 house this past weekend. We arrive, FIL wasn\u2019t there. MIL sat us down and asked for $25,000. We were stunned, and asked why. She was equivocating, but we have a good idea since she was always irresponsible with money. He told me growing up she was a SAHM with a lot of free time so she\u2019d regularly spend hours at the expensive grocery stores and buy a lot of pricey groceries that they\u2019d eventually throw out. She still does this, I\u2019ve seen her buy 5 bushels of farmers market fruit NOT to eat, but bc she likes the smell. Then throw it out. She\u2019d lie about the cost of things, regularly treat her friends for dinners out etc. There are no secret vices, it\u2019s stuff like that that adds up. It was the source of all the conflict in the house. FIL put her on an allowance of sorts, so she opened up her own credit card, and here we are. My husband suggested therapy in the past (for all her issues), but seems like she won\u2019t go.\n\nProbably relevant that I make more money than husband which is why she brought me into it, she knows my husband doesn\u2019t have that kind of cash. Any way, this is where I may be an AH. So after our questions, my husband tells her we\u2019d have to think about it. I just blurted out, \u201cUhhhh no. Sorry but no. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d I was surprised by how blunt I was since our arms-length relationship is predicated on extreme politeness. \n\nHusband looked at me like, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d, and she looked wounded. \n \nAfter we left, he told me I should have let him deal with this, and I made her feel lower than she did. He said he wouldn\u2019t have given her anything unless we agreed. I mean, she asked me too, so\u2026 \n\nWas I the AH for shutting my MIL down like that?", "created_utc": 1668467834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvfyfk/aita_for_shutting_down_mils_request_for_money_to/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was pretty ballsy to make that kind of request. It deserved to not have any questions linger of if y\u2019all would help. Hubs might be upset. But it\u2019s probably going to be something he\u2019s thankful for down the road", "NTA-you were there, no way you give someone 25k, she can get another job if she wants more cash.", "NTA. Why give her false hope. She\u2019s not going to change and she doesn\u2019t want to. If you help you\u2019re just further enabling her to escape the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. From what you said, seems like MIL just wants a cash cow to pay off her irresponsibility. She should get a PT job and pay off her debts, or talk to FIL and come clean. It's not YOUR responsibility to pay her debts! If your Husband wants to use HIS OWN money, that's on him. But make sure your finances can handle that.", "NTA. If she's got the gall to spend money like it's going out of fashion, not listen to people trying to help her over time, then try to ask for it because of her bad habits, then yes, you have every right to be blunt with her.\nProbably won't do you want favours but these kind of people need to know boundaries for their own stupidity before they go too far.", "NTA. Could the situation have used more tact, yes. However telling her he\u2019d think about it, opens your husband up to be hassled for the money and guilted into giving it. And you dealing with the consequences. \n\nIf she brings it up again, demand FIL is in the room with you so he knows what she\u2019s asking", "NTA. Why hem and haw. The answer is no. What more is there to say. She should feel low. She\u2019s lying to her husband and begging for money.", "NTA I understand that your boyfriend wanted to handle this with velvet gloves, but it is enabling behaviour like his that got her in this predicament in the first place.\n\nThe fact she asked for it behind your father-in-laws back, shows she is not taking responsibility for her own actions.", "NTA and a definite no is better than we\u2019ll talk about it. And no freaking way in hell should you give her that much or any money, and her husband needs to know she asked", "NTA, I definitely think that face-to-face is the best way to handle this, so I don't understand how it could be deemed negative.  She asked both of you in person, so if you left it to your husband to deal with, you wouldn't get to say your piece.\n\nWhen you're talking about such a huge amount of money, blunt honesty is needed.  If there was a chance you would be able to, you could have taken the opportunity to ask her questions, sort out terms there and then.  but instead, it was not possible, so you nipped it in the bud immediately.\n\nIf she asked for less, or explained a serious issue, it would have been different.  But I would probably have blurted out the same thing.", "NTA and no issue with how you stated it very clearly. Who the hell just asks someone for 25k as though they\u2019re asking for a drink of water", "NTA\n\nYou need to shut that down as soon as possible.  Your hub leaving it open still has the same effect, just further down the line.", "NTA. She asked. You answered. She needs to learn She cannot keep asking people to help her dig herself out. She made her grave in debt. She can only get herself out. \n\nHim beating around the bush will only encourage her and make her think people will eventually help her. Standing your ground and locking that door behind you shows that neither of you will help her. Period.", "NTA. A request like that, when everyone knows how she handles her finances, needs a firm \"no.\" Maybe you were blunter than you meant to be, but your husband saying \"we need time to think\" leaves her room for interpretation. She can't expect other people to continue to fund her shopping trips, especially on wasting food, which is a whole other issue.\n\nEdit: changed word", "NTA.\n\nI mean sure you weren't particularly tactful about it, but there's not really a tactful way to ask for 25k either. I think that ask would stun most people into total honesty. Besides, she was blunt and upfront in her request, you matched that tone in your response. Seems to me that's plenty fair.", "NTA \u2026..  Will he give her it without your knowledge ?  Is this a possibility \u2026", "NTA. I would have said NO immediately too...", "NTA - it's very complicated when you are trying to say no. Sometimes there is no polite way.", "NTA with out the negative feedback this is never getting better, you give her the money she pays off cards and then boom right back to bull shit. You need to take away her soft landing so she faces reality which is exactly what you have done", "If someone wants a $25k loan, they should go to a bank.\n\nIf you give her any money at all, make sure you have her sign some sort of legally enforceable contract stating how much she gets and how she will pay it back and when.\n\nThat is a RIDICULOUS amount of money to ask for.\n\nNTA", "Not the asshole!!! The hero!!!\n\nEdited to say: I don\u2019t think more tact was needed. I bet MIL has a habit of stomping on DH and asking too much - how else could she possibly have the gall to make sure a request?!?! I think you saved him from misery, even if it hurt her (sorry, not sorry). Let them both be pissy - he\u2019ll thank you for it in a few days or whenever he comes out of the FOG (fear / obligation / guilt).", "NTA. It may be his mother, but she would have felt the same way getting the answer \"no\" either way. And honestly, it isn't like waiting until you left would change the answer. \n\nIt's a lot of money to ask family for. She should be asking a bank. Or, you know, getting her spending under control. That's not your issue. She needs to work on that herself.", "NTA\n\nThat's really the right way to completely shut down MIL. No is a complete sentence and leaves no room for misconceptions. \n\nGood for you! You have a shiny spine and firm boundaries!", "NTA .. no tact needed, uh Hell no.... but be warned your husband is going to try to back door it to her. People kill me wanting everything sugar coated\" Not going to happen ma'am\" is exactly what I would have said too...", "NTA..how was she going to pay it back? And while your response may have lacked \"tact\" sometimes being blunt  is best so that there is zero confusion. If hubby had said \"we'll let you know\" that may have gotten her hopes up and possibly went out and spent more.", "NTA. Does your FIL know that she has this credit card and is asking for a large sum of money? He really needs to be brought into the loop.", "NTA\n\nShe needed to be shut down immediately.  Asking for $100 for medication when it is an emergency and you run short?  Maybe.  $25,000?  Heck no.  Just no.", "NTA", "Eh, maybe you could have been more diplomatic about it. Even if you weren't considering it.", "I am going with NAH. She asked and you said no. If she keeps pushing it then that would change things. Personally I would have let my husband deal with it. Money and family is messy", "NTA for saying no to MIL\u2019s request. She has refused to learn the Life Lesson that one cannot spend more than one makes. She needs to experience the natural consequences of her actions. \n\nMaybe a little bit AH to your partner for overriding him so definitively and undermining your partnership.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that your SO was offended, but we\u2019re not talking about a couple of thousand dollars here. This is $25k that is a result of her spending addiction. Plus, SO doesn\u2019t have the income to pay for it, so it would be on you. That\u2019s a big ol\u2019 nope.", "NTA. It takes balls to ask for $25,000.", "NTA if you\u2019re not on board at all then why equivocate? She either was asking you or both of you for money. Regardless your agreeing was required and if it\u2019s a NO then why wait? Also that\u2019s no small amount. Woman needs help or maybe save that $25k for FIL if he needs a divorce atty", "NTA it was your place to deal with it because she brought you into it and irs mainly your money.", "NTA, but maybe talk things out with your s/o instead of blurting out the no. You were right to say no, but not right that second, maybe.", "Nta but since this is the first time I would have let him handle it. \n\nIf this was time 2 of her bugging then be harsh", "People have no tact anymore. N T A for saying no, but YTA for how you said it. Leave people with some dignity.", "YTA for how you reacted in that situation but NTA for saying no at a $25,000 loan\u2026I could pay my tuition off and then some with that kind of money", "NTA but you lack tact...", "YTA sorry, you should have talked with hubs first to present a united front. You didn't have to \"let him handle her\", but preemptively saying to no AT THE SAME TIME your husband is saying \"we will discuss it\" it's hella rude of you To Your Husband.\n\nThis is not about what you said to his mom.\n\n\nThis is about the fact that you didn't talk to your husband first and present a united front. Now your hubs is going to have to hear about why his wife doesn't like his mom, etc etc.\n\nGood job opening that can of worms. I suggest you apologize to hubs for not discussing with him first. Even if it was in the corner for 5 minutes.", "YTA, not to your MIL but towards ypur husband, I don't think it was with bad intent, and you shouldn't beat yourself to much for it", "You should have talked about it away from MIL before telling her no. I know you wanted to shut her idea of getting money from you down right away but you should have offered your husband the curtesy of at least having the conversation. The fact that you make more money is irrelevant in this. Lending the money would be a mutual decision. Tell your husband you're sorry you blurted out the no and that in the future you'll talk things over with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
