Husband and I were invited to his parents\u2019 house this past weekend. We arrive, FIL wasn\u2019t there. MIL sat us down and asked for $25,000. We were stunned, and asked why. She was equivocating, but we have a good idea since she was always irresponsible with money. He told me growing up she was a SAHM with a lot of free time so she\u2019d regularly spend hours at the expensive grocery stores and buy a lot of pricey groceries that they\u2019d eventually throw out. She still does this, I\u2019ve seen her buy 5 bushels of farmers market fruit NOT to eat, but bc she likes the smell. Then throw it out. She\u2019d lie about the cost of things, regularly treat her friends for dinners out etc. There are no secret vices, it\u2019s stuff like that that adds up. It was the source of all the conflict in the house. FIL put her on an allowance of sorts, so she opened up her own credit card, and here we are. My husband suggested therapy in the past (for all her issues), but seems like she won\u2019t go.\n\nProbably relevant that I make more money than husband which is why she brought me into it, she knows my husband doesn\u2019t have that kind of cash. Any way, this is where I may be an AH. So after our questions, my husband tells her we\u2019d have to think about it. I just blurted out, \u201cUhhhh no. Sorry but no. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d I was surprised by how blunt I was since our arms-length relationship is predicated on extreme politeness. \n\nHusband looked at me like, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d, and she looked wounded. \n \nAfter we left, he told me I should have let him deal with this, and I made her feel lower than she did. He said he wouldn\u2019t have given her anything unless we agreed. I mean, she asked me too, so\u2026 \n\nWas I the AH for shutting my MIL down like that?", "created_utc": 1668467834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvfyfk/aita_for_shutting_down_mils_request_for_money_to/", "score": 1208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was pretty ballsy to make that kind of request. It deserved to not have any questions linger of if y\u2019all would help. Hubs might be upset. But it\u2019s probably going to be something he\u2019s thankful for down the road", "NTA-you were there, no way you give someone 25k, she can get another job if she wants more cash.", "NTA. Why give her false hope. She\u2019s not going to change and she doesn\u2019t want to. If you help you\u2019re just further enabling her to escape the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. From what you said, seems like MIL just wants a cash cow to pay off her irresponsibility. She should get a PT job and pay off her debts, or talk to FIL and come clean. It's not YOUR responsibility to pay her debts! If your Husband wants to use HIS OWN money, that's on him. But make sure your finances can handle that.", "NTA. If she's got the gall to spend money like it's going out of fashion, not listen to people trying to help her over time, then try to ask for it because of her bad habits, then yes, you have every right to be blunt with her.\nProbably won't do you want favours but these kind of people need to know boundaries for their own stupidity before they go too far.", "NTA. Could the situation have used more tact, yes. However telling her he\u2019d think about it, opens your husband up to be hassled for the money and guilted into giving it. And you dealing with the consequences. \n\nIf she brings it up again, demand FIL is in the room with you so he knows what she\u2019s asking", "NTA. Why hem and haw. The answer is no. What more is there to say. She should feel low. She\u2019s lying to her husband and begging for money.", "NTA I understand that your boyfriend wanted to handle this with velvet gloves, but it is enabling behaviour like his that got her in this predicament in the first place.\n\nThe fact she asked for it behind your father-in-laws back, shows she is not taking responsibility for her own actions.", "NTA and a definite no is better than we\u2019ll talk about it. And no freaking way in hell should you give her that much or any money, and her husband needs to know she asked", "NTA, I definitely think that face-to-face is the best way to handle this, so I don't understand how it could be deemed negative.  She asked both of you in person, so if you left it to your husband to deal with, you wouldn't get to say your piece.\n\nWhen you're talking about such a huge amount of money, blunt honesty is needed.  If there was a chance you would be able to, you could have taken the opportunity to ask her questions, sort out terms there and then.  but instead, it was not possible, so you nipped it in the bud immediately.\n\nIf she asked for less, or explained a serious issue, it would have been different.  But I would probably have blurted out the same thing.", "NTA and no issue with how you stated it very clearly. Who the hell just asks someone for 25k as though they\u2019re asking for a drink of water", "NTA\n\nYou need to shut that down as soon as possible.  Your hub leaving it open still has the same effect, just further down the line.", "NTA. She asked. You answered. She needs to learn She cannot keep asking people to help her dig herself out. She made her grave in debt. She can only get herself out. \n\nHim beating around the bush will only encourage her and make her think people will eventually help her. Standing your ground and locking that door behind you shows that neither of you will help her. Period.", "NTA. A request like that, when everyone knows how she handles her finances, needs a firm \"no.\" Maybe you were blunter than you meant to be, but your husband saying \"we need time to think\" leaves her room for interpretation. She can't expect other people to continue to fund her shopping trips, especially on wasting food, which is a whole other issue.\n\nEdit: changed word", "NTA.\n\nI mean sure you weren't particularly tactful about it, but there's not really a tactful way to ask for 25k either. I think that ask would stun most people into total honesty. Besides, she was blunt and upfront in her request, you matched that tone in your response. Seems to me that's plenty fair.", "NTA \u2026..  Will he give her it without your knowledge ?  Is this a possibility \u2026", "NTA. I would have said NO immediately too...", "NTA - it's very complicated when you are trying to say no. Sometimes there is no polite way.", "NTA with out the negative feedback this is never getting better, you give her the money she pays off cards and then boom right back to bull shit. You need to take away her soft landing so she faces reality which is exactly what you have done", "If someone wants a $25k loan, they should go to a bank.\n\nIf you give her any money at all, make sure you have her sign some sort of legally enforceable contract stating how much she gets and how she will pay it back and when.\n\nThat is a RIDICULOUS amount of money to ask for.\n\nNTA", "Not the asshole!!! The hero!!!\n\nEdited to say: I don\u2019t think more tact was needed. I bet MIL has a habit of stomping on DH and asking too much - how else could she possibly have the gall to make sure a request?!?! I think you saved him from misery, even if it hurt her (sorry, not sorry). Let them both be pissy - he\u2019ll thank you for it in a few days or whenever he comes out of the FOG (fear / obligation / guilt).", "NTA. It may be his mother, but she would have felt the same way getting the answer \"no\" either way. And honestly, it isn't like waiting until you left would change the answer. \n\nIt's a lot of money to ask family for. She should be asking a bank. Or, you know, getting her spending under control. That's not your issue. She needs to work on that herself.", "NTA\n\nThat's really the right way to completely shut down MIL. No is a complete sentence and leaves no room for misconceptions. \n\nGood for you! You have a shiny spine and firm boundaries!", "NTA .. no tact needed, uh Hell no.... but be warned your husband is going to try to back door it to her. People kill me wanting everything sugar coated\" Not going to happen ma'am\" is exactly what I would have said too...", "NTA..how was she going to pay it back? And while your response may have lacked \"tact\" sometimes being blunt  is best so that there is zero confusion. If hubby had said \"we'll let you know\" that may have gotten her hopes up and possibly went out and spent more.", "NTA. Does your FIL know that she has this credit card and is asking for a large sum of money? He really needs to be brought into the loop.", "NTA\n\nShe needed to be shut down immediately.  Asking for $100 for medication when it is an emergency and you run short?  Maybe.  $25,000?  Heck no.  Just no.", "NTA", "Eh, maybe you could have been more diplomatic about it. Even if you weren't considering it.", "I am going with NAH. She asked and you said no. If she keeps pushing it then that would change things. Personally I would have let my husband deal with it. Money and family is messy", "NTA for saying no to MIL\u2019s request. She has refused to learn the Life Lesson that one cannot spend more than one makes. She needs to experience the natural consequences of her actions. \n\nMaybe a little bit AH to your partner for overriding him so definitively and undermining your partnership.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that your SO was offended, but we\u2019re not talking about a couple of thousand dollars here. This is $25k that is a result of her spending addiction. Plus, SO doesn\u2019t have the income to pay for it, so it would be on you. That\u2019s a big ol\u2019 nope.", "NTA. It takes balls to ask for $25,000.", "NTA if you\u2019re not on board at all then why equivocate? She either was asking you or both of you for money. Regardless your agreeing was required and if it\u2019s a NO then why wait? Also that\u2019s no small amount. Woman needs help or maybe save that $25k for FIL if he needs a divorce atty", "NTA it was your place to deal with it because she brought you into it and irs mainly your money.", "NTA, but maybe talk things out with your s/o instead of blurting out the no. You were right to say no, but not right that second, maybe.", "Nta but since this is the first time I would have let him handle it. \n\nIf this was time 2 of her bugging then be harsh", "People have no tact anymore. N T A for saying no, but YTA for how you said it. Leave people with some dignity.", "YTA for how you reacted in that situation but NTA for saying no at a $25,000 loan\u2026I could pay my tuition off and then some with that kind of money", "NTA but you lack tact...", "YTA sorry, you should have talked with hubs first to present a united front. You didn't have to \"let him handle her\", but preemptively saying to no AT THE SAME TIME your husband is saying \"we will discuss it\" it's hella rude of you To Your Husband.\n\nThis is not about what you said to his mom.\n\n\nThis is about the fact that you didn't talk to your husband first and present a united front. Now your hubs is going to have to hear about why his wife doesn't like his mom, etc etc.\n\nGood job opening that can of worms. I suggest you apologize to hubs for not discussing with him first. Even if it was in the corner for 5 minutes.", "YTA, not to your MIL but towards ypur husband, I don't think it was with bad intent, and you shouldn't beat yourself to much for it", "You should have talked about it away from MIL before telling her no. I know you wanted to shut her idea of getting money from you down right away but you should have offered your husband the curtesy of at least having the conversation. The fact that you make more money is irrelevant in this. Lending the money would be a mutual decision.

She has a problem, and until she hits rock bottom she may never admit that the problem is her. She probably still thinks that the problem is the money, but it\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s her inability to control her spending. If you paid off her credit card for her, she\u2019ll be back within 6 months asking for another $25k.

He's bailed her out in the past but not insisted on overseeing the spending to see if she'd got it under control.", "NTA\nGood on you. Blunt is exactly the way to be when it comes to lending money. MIL obviously has a problem. FIL probably knows nothing about this credit card and she doesn't want him yo know either. This Is an addiction  and your husband shouldn't be feeding into it this way. Keep a close eye on shared money, I feel husband might start helping out his mother without telling you to make her feel better about this \"embarrassment\".", "NTA\n\nYour MIL brought you to the discussion, so you answered for your part. Your husband wants to coddle his mom and per his response, he even entertained the idea.", "No at least she knows that it was a for real No and not a I\u2019ll ask again later no", "NTA. And if your husband is willing to help his mom keep secrets from her husband, how do you think he feels about secrets. That would be a gigantic red flag and screams THERAPY loudly.", "NTA. You were being honest. If you hadn\u2019t spoke up she would assume you would eventually give her the money.", "NTA", "NTA. While I usually don't advise getting in the middle of things. Someone needs to tell your FIL.", "\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b91 to", "Either way she\u2019d be broke and in debt again.", "Last time you gave me $5,000, but now I have even more debt and you won\u2019t help your mother out? Yeah can vouch from extended family experiences there\u2019s always another \u201cemergency\u201d.\n\nNote: I do take emergencies very seriously, just not manufactured one", "NTA. She\u2019s got a problem and isn\u2019t willing to address it. Your reaction may be exactly what\u2019s needed instead of all the pussyfooting about that\u2019s happened and got her into this situation.", "NTA\n\nShe asked you and you said no. Plus I doubt she'd pay off the credit card to begin with, she probably use it to wrack up more debt buying things she doesn't need/use", "NTA. Don't get sucked into a co-dependent relationship with an addict. Best to be completely clear.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been there. However I wasn\u2019t asked (as if I don\u2019t exist and have no say) and money -lots of it- has been given. I am so happy you said no. People should stop asking for money from others just cause they can\u2019t downgrade from their luxury life style. F that!", "NTA", "Why are you framing this as you being blunt, harsh, unkind or even impolite to your MIL? I think what you said was matter of fact and neutral at worst. You conveyed your unwillingness to comply with her request. Unless you said something later that you\u2019re leaving out, it sounds like you basically said no and left it at that. Now, your husband may have a point in which it was his place to manage his side of the family, but still nothing wrong was said and if my take is correct it was more of a reflex/reaction than a considered response where you went for all those rationalization phases described (I make more money, my husband doesn\u2019t have that kind of cash and she asked me too), probably also aided by how ballsy she was by asking 25k in one seating\u2026 so stop framing it like that and stop with the guilt", "It\u2019s Kinder to give a direct answer then let her think she may have a chance of getting the money so NTA", "NTA. It sounds like family has enabled her enough. You were right to shut that shit down right then and there.", "NTA. Good on you for shutting her down. Sorry husband feels bad but your answer will make them think twice about ever asking again!!  Lol", "NTA \n\nIf you want to do anything for your MIL then give her this book.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Debt-Proof-Living-Debt-Stay-That/dp/0800721454/\n\nAlways bailing someone like this out is only enabling the behavior and compounding it. She needs to learn to deal with it and dig herself out. I say this as someone that has done it.", "NTA, $25k is a huge ask that doesn\u2019t require any thought. Sorry that\u2019s what bank loans are for.", "NTA but someone needs to tell FIL what\u2019s going on here.", "NTA wtf", "You're so right about FIL.\nMIL knows she's basically feeding an addiction of sorts, and FIL is aware and probably trying to get her to stop. OP should point this out to husband. Enabling behaviour won't help her in the long run.", "25k will turn into 50K..... 50K will be another 50k,  and just keep going and  going.", "Yep, i got a credit card that allows me to go in dept couse im a student, but i dont have a job. I started take little a think i will pay this off easy. In 2 months i go trough all the money. Had to get a job i payed it off in 2 months easy, but when you have larger amount of money at disposil you just take a little by little a think nothing will happen. It will happen the same here. Of course i broke that card in half after i payed of everything. Never doing that again.", "I felt shameful before when I had to ask my dad for \u20ac300 to help with an emergency. It was 9 years ago and I still feel bad about it. 25000!!!! Insane.", "Friends in their 80\u2019s getting a job!?", "Yeah, this one is working as a janitor at an airport. Her reason for working is pretty sad", "NTA! You did the right thing by turning her down right away. Why bring her hopes up, or did your husband think he was going to butter you up, so he COULD give her the money? Your MILs financial woes are caused by her own hands and it is no one's problem but her own.", "NTA. If MIL didn\u2019t want you to answer, then she shouldn\u2019t have asked you for cash. If you didn\u2019t shut it down she\u2019d probably still be harassing you guys and/ or trying to negotiate for less money. It\u2019s an awkward situation but one of her making", "My Aunt did this with her parents/ My grandparents, my Mum eventually had to step in and get them to stop giving her money as it was just feeding her vices and hoarding habits; and draining their savings.\n\nNTA being blunt was the best course of action in this situation, any beating about the Bush and she'd keep pressing and that's not good for anyone", "NTA -- She had no business putting you in that position in the first place.  And your hubby should have backed you up.", "NTA, and tell FIL.  He needs to protect himself from debt collectors.", "NTA. But my concern is MIL has hidden/lied about finances, and now you've said no your husband will do the same. He will help her, which is going to impact your relationship financially and emotionally. FIL has always sorted things out, sounds like he's also said no, and now your other half will step into his shoes, guarantee it. You need to speak to your FIL so he knows the situation, and encourage MIL to get a job.", "NTA. She's got a problem and she's not managing it. The fact that she asked you for money should have been a lightbulb moment for her.", "NTA but I think you should explain to your husband that you didn't mean to be that blunt and it was just a build up of frustration. Clarify that you never thought he'd do something that financially significant behind your back, it was purely a blurted shock reaction.", "You're right not to give her the money. It would just enable her to continue her spending and not deal with her addiction. She has to face the consequences of her own behaviour.", "You shut down the debate immediately and I don't blame you. The solution to her debt is not to give her more money. NTA.", "One HELPS a person with an addiction, or not - but one should not enable it - and you shut down ANY option of accidental enabling.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is time your MIL learns the consequences of her actions and that everybody stops treating her with silk gloves.", "NTA \n\nShe asked you both and as she already knows you were the only one who would have that kind of cash then IMO was better to just tell her no.  \n\nHusband can deal with her as he likes with his personal money however IMO giving her any money to keep doing this is no different than giving an alcoholic booze.  Nothing changes and she will just keep repeating over and over again.  \n\nI\u2019d say I feel bad for your FIL but he knows her by now and is probably just waiting to hear from his son again.", "NTA there would be no point in giving her money as her behaviours haven't changed. She would be better coming up with a plan with her husband to pay it off, by making real changes in her spending and getting a job. Paying it off for her just won't do any good at all. As she will have a clean slate to do it all over again. A clear no was for the best. Why women are taught that a clear no is rude I have no idea.", "NTA why lead her on into thinking you might give her something she got herself in this situation and refuses to get help so hell no", "NTA .Made her feel low? She should've felt low asking for that amount of cash. MIL and husband shouldn't be mad at the answer", "NTA\n\nShe needed to be directly told \"no\". What your husband is doing is enabling. Even giving her \"we'll think about it\" is enabling even if he was still going to refuse.\n\nPeople like his mother get as bad as they do because people spare their feelings over their irresponsible antics.\n\nShe is literally throwing money away during a global recession. She's had her whole life to figure this out and she's still a burden on her family.\n\nSo, yes, this is the exact response she needs to get every time from now on.\n\nYou should speak with your husband about going to therapy himself. He needs to realize he picked up enabler survival tactics which is just continuing this vicious cycle of irresponsible spending.", "I wasnt aware that my cousin got married! This sounds near identical to my Aunt. Seriously though, NTA you have to put your foot down. These people never learn otherwise.  My Dad and Uncle are always helping out my Aunt financially and she just continues to spend money like water.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\n$25K is a big chunk of change. Given the history you described, you would just be extending MIL's problem if you gave her the money.\n\nPersonally, I would also tell FIL what happened. FIL and MIL need to be on the same page over their finances or they will end up destitute.", "NTA considering that the money given would be mostly yours, and she asked the both of you (sounds like yourself more directly) why is it only him who is allowed to deal with this. Giving her false hope while he sits on his hands or pressures you is just cruel and enabling. At least here you haven't wasted her time and she can find another way out of her mess. Keep a close eye on your bank accounts.", "I think your husband absolutely has first dibs on how the two of you go about turning her down, given it's his mother and the relationship between the both of you and your MIL affects him more as a result, so assuming you don't have any reason to assume he wouldn't generally stick to \"we aren't giving you 25 grand\", very gently, YTA.", "NTA\n\n25000 isn't exactly pocket change. It sounds like the FIL doesn't even know about the card debt, or when she finally confessed to him he told her he wouldn't be paying it off, and she would have to pay it out of her allowance or get a job to pay it off. Your MIL would rather ask you for the money so that she can continue spending the way she does. \n\nIt sounds like she does need help to deal with her issues, enabling her won't help her. She won't get help until she hits rock bottom. \n\nIt's time for tough love, you need to help your husband understand this. The whole family needs to sit down and have a frank discussion about this. You all need to be on the same page.", "This. Giving money to friends and relatives is the best way to ruin relationships. In this case it is certain she will waste money on trivial things again. She asked you so you are very much right in denying instead of giving any false hope. N T A", "I think she would  she is likely desperate and debt collectors will show up soon,  which she will not be able to hide from FIL.", "Ohhh seems like a sonsband.", "I think you should tell FIL.  FIL and MIL need to address MIL's problems with money."]}
