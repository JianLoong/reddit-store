{"id": 25669, "submission_id": "16351bt", "title": "AITA for telling my[29f] husband[34m] not to call his ex-wife his wife?", "selftext": "So my husband (Daniel for privacy) and I have been married for just under a year and I love him very much, he has an 8 year old daughter (Jane for privacy) from his previous marriage who I love as my own, he's always been respectful and patient which is part of why I decided to marry him. We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow. We ended up quarantining together and after 3 years we decided to tie the knot. The wedding ceremony was everything a girl could dream of and we've honestly had very few issues in our first year as a couple. It wasn't until we went to pick up Jane from her summer camp that I started seeing an issue\n\nI went to meet up with him at the front desk, I found him chatting with the camp coordinator which is all well and good until I overheard what he was saying. He mentioned that \"my wife made me this jacket actually, she was really good at all that sewing stuff\". He was referring to his ex-wife(Alyssa for privacy) NOT me. It bugged me a little but I brushed it off as a one-time thing, an accident. We don't talk about Alyssa much unless we're around Jane, and even then he usually refers to her as \"Jane's mom\", I never heard him call her his wife, especially now that WE were married.\n\nIt wasn't until a week or two later that I learned he does this a lot. We were at a get-together with some friends from work, my first time meeting them. It was all good until one of them asked me questions about baseball. I admitted I didn't know much about the sport and he said that was weird because Daniel had mentioned I was really good at the game and even played some in college, it left me very confused. After talking to some more guys I found out this was a common issue, a lot of them thought Alyssa and I were the same person because Dan called us both his wife. At this point I got really offended, we had been married for 10 months and he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet, I was super awkward and explaining to people that he still called his ex-wife his wife was utterly humiliating, especially the amount he does it, not just one or two people but the whole office.\n\nWhen we got home we fought. He said he didn't even think about it that way, that since he never divorced Alyssa he never stopped thinking about her as his wife, he still stands by the fact that Alyssa is his wife, despite how embarrassing it is to explain to people that I'm not his second wife but rather his new wife and Alyssa his ex. I told him that if he wasn't ready to move on then he shouldn't have married me, if he can't commit to being my husband then he shouldn't get to call me his wife. I spent the next night at my sister's house ignoring his calls, we recently started to smooth things over by not talking about them but I can tell that this is going to be a sore spot in the marriage I am trying so desperately to save.", "created_utc": 1693177284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16351bt/aita_for_telling_my29f_husband34m_not_to_call_his/", "score": 4682, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You HAVE to stop saying \"ex\" wife. They didn't divorce. You just have to stop using that term. However, she is his LATE wife and you *both* need to start using that term to refer to her. It's disrespectful of you to call her his ex, and it's disrespectful of him to talk about her in a way that makes people think you and her are the same person. \n\nShe is his late wife, you are his current wife. It's not that complicated.", "It\u2019s not his ex wife\u2026 he\u2019s widowed. I have never been widowed, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a hard adjustment to make. Maybe he should say late wife because she\u2019s not his ex.\n\nEdited to add- Soft YTA. I say this because I understand how you feel, but at the same time I understand how it may be weird for him to say ex because she\u2019s not his ex.", "YTA\n\nShe's not his ex. He is her widower. There is a whole world of difference between a marriage that ends in divorce, and a marriage that ends in the death of one of the partners. If you can't cope with the fact that he can love both you and his late wife, then you shouldn't have married him. You are completely at fault here.", "ESH.  She is his late wife not his ex wife.", "I can understand as a new wife, hearing this is probably uncomfortable and he really shouldn\u2019t have gotten into a relationship/marriage with you until he had enough time to grieve it sounds like. It\u2019s unfortunate but there should\u2019ve been a talk in the beginning because I really don\u2019t think a year after his wife\u2019s death has really allowed him enough time to grieve. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how hard it is to once refer to someone as their wife for so long, and then they pass way and now he has to say \u201clate wife\u201d, so for that reason it really does seem he shouldn\u2019t have gotten straight into a long-term commitment with someone and should\u2019ve took the time to heal. I think therapy for him is the best option as he navigates and goes through his grief and also marriage counseling for the both of you. I don\u2019t think either of you know how to deal with this situation because it\u2019s definitely a sensitive circumstance to be put in. Both of you need support in different ways so I think counseling and creating that level of communication will ultimately help you in your marriage. \n\nI know it\u2019s been said in this thread multiple times, but please be careful about how you refer to his late wife as an \u201cex-wife\u201d, because that\u2019s incredibly offensive to her and to him. From personal experience, my mom died when I was a kid and I mistakenly referred to her as my dad\u2019s ex-wife because I was too young and had no idea about the term \u201clate wife\u201d and I\u2019ll never forget the hurt on my dad\u2019s face once I said it and I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it probably felt for him.", "YTA. Alyssa is not is ex wife. It's his late wife.\n\nIf you don't want to have to deal with a late wife and a man's past, don't marry a widower with bagage and try to erase a part of his life.", "YTA. A deceased spouse is not an ex-spouse.\n\nIf you can't accept that he had a wife, the mother of his child, don't marry a widower. She is and will always be part of his life, because she helped to make it what it now is.\n\nI can understand being upset that people were confusing you, but you went way out of line about this.\n\nHonestly, if I were him, I would struggle to forgive a lot of what you said.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s not his ex-wife and you can\u2019t expect him to call her that.\n\nBut he\u2019s making a habit of being unclear about your marriage and it\u2019s actually confusing people. It seems like he might have some unprocessed grief. \n\nInstead of being jealous of a dead woman, try talking to your husband about what he\u2019s been feeling lately. You should talk about his late wife together, not just for the child. It\u2019s healthy.", "Gentle YTA - It is his late wife. Ex-wife would mean he was divorced. It's going to be a transition for him, and for you. You are going to have to be patient, as perhaps this marriage happened too quickly for both of you. If you cannot respect that this will take time, maybe you should move on.", "I think he needs to refer to his deceased wife as his late wife, never the ex-wife.  She will always be a part of their lives. I don't think it is fair to the new wife for him not to differentiate between the two wives. Perhaps couples therapy would help them work through this. No one is the AH, just a lot of confusion and emotions.", "[deleted]", "Maybe you can ask him to say \u201cmy late wife\u201d. She\u2019s not an ex. But I get you wanting the recognition of being his actual wife. I\u2019m going to say NAH but please do not continue to call her his ex wife because I\u2019m sure that angers him and it\u2019s not factual. Like if you\u2019re communicating through this, you have to look at the FACTS. And the fact is that she passed, not that they divorced.", "NAH. He\u2019s mourning and it\u2019s hard to say \u201cex\u201d when it\u2019s not like divorce but death but it\u2019s also not fair to you to be put in those awkward situations. I was more Y T A until the examples made it clear he\u2019s doing a terrible job at differentiating when talking to others and setting you up for awkwardness. \n\nLike many questions on Reddit, I think more communication to each other instead of us is the answer and I wish you both well.", "I would say overall..esh. instead of trying to have him say \"exwife\" when talking about her, maybe ask him to call her his \"late wife\"when he talks about her to others. She isn't his ex because she died. I understand you feeling upset because of having to correct other people as well as it make you feel lesser than, but maybe try wording it differently when talking about the situation. \nYou both need to sit down and talk it out. Maybe ask him what he loves about you? You mentioned all the things he has talked about his late wife and how it was confusing because it wasn't stuff you did. I am nosey, Has he ever bragged about you?", "YTA. She isn\u2019t his ex wife. She is his late wife, or his first wife. You are his current wife, his second wife, whether you like it or not.", "YTA. You mean his late wife, the mother of his child, the woman that died while still being married to Daniel. \nI was going for ESH because I kinda get that you do not want to be on the same level as an ex but here is the deal you are not. I get that it might be annoying but it feels like he has some unprocessed grief or does not know how to handle the situation respectfully. That is why I would say that his \u201eoffense\u201c is less. He seems to have a thought time handling the situation.", "You need to grow up and learn that Alyssa isn\u2019t his ex wife. Jealously is ugly. YTA", ">  he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet  \n  \nLook this is difficult with who should be calling who what and all but she fucking died. He certainly shouldn't be calling her the ex and you should be a little less aggressive with your quest to have him change the nomenclature for his DEAD wife. Right now I don't think you'd get the same naming convention if something were to happen to you. Honestly ESH.", "She's not his EX, she's his LATE wife. I can certainly understand why hearing him call her his wife is upsetting, and he should respect that and make an effort to change what he calls her, but the proper term is LATE wife, or first wife if he doesn't want to get into a whole discussion around his widowhood.", "She\u2019s isn\u2019t an \u201cex-wife\u201d. She is his \u201clate-wife.\u201d I get why you are upset at the confusion but you are going to have to accept that and maybe request he use the term late-wife whenever he refers to her with others. You shouldn\u2019t have married a widower if you can\u2019t accept that she will always be part of his and his child\u2019s life. Sorry. Try and have some grace though. You can\u2019t erase her and if you try it will be met with resentment by him and his child. Soft YTA because I understand, but you are still in the wrong.", "First off, you\u2019ve been married for almost a year and dated for 3 and got together right before the pandemix, do you mean a year before the pandemic? Otherwise the math doesn\u2019t quite match up to me. It\u2019s still rather fresh that he\u2019s remarried even after 4 or 5 years of her having passed. \n\nThe fact that you called her his ex wife is pretty sucky and wrong. There\u2019s a huge difference. My boyfriend died in 2014, I would never refer to him as my ex boyfriend. Late wife or late boyfriend is a bit better in terms of being clear but when talking about him in the past tense I still use boyfriend often and I\u2019m married now. I usually explain he passed, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making it seem I have a boyfriend and a husband. \n\nI also didn\u2019t even date for a year and a half and it took me years still to fully engage in my next relationship. It\u2019s a hard thing to move forward from and we didn\u2019t even have children. \n\nYTA for having no sense of respect for this situation.", "ESH. \n1. Daniel needs to clarify Alyssa as his late wife and you as his 2nd wife when talking to people to avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\n2. You need to correct your descriptors of Alyssa from Ex- to Late since Daniel and Alyssa were never divorced and you calling her an Ex is disrespectful.", "YTA. The only way she would be his ex wife is if they\u2019d divorced. Sure, he could have said \u201clate wife\u201d or something like that, but she will never be his ex. She is always going to hold that place in his heart, and demanding that he change that mindset is never going to end well for you.", "YTA.  She\u2019s not his ex-wife.  So he\u2019s never going to want to call her that.  It\u2019s inaccurate and sounds harsh.  Late wife is more accurate.  I can understand that it may cause a little confusion to call her his wife. In the case of the jacket he was talking about when/how he got it and she was his wife at the time.  You need to let this go though.  She\u2019s dead.  You don\u2019t need to be jealous of her.", "ESH.  While I get the awkward situation he has you in, you need to communicate that in order to make it not awkward, he should refer to her as his \"late wife\" as she passed, they didn't divorce.  Both of you need to discuss this situation and not just ignore it as an attempt to smooth things over.", "Ex wife doesn't make sense.  \n\nBut neither does just 'wife.'  \n\nI'm not quite sure what the best, efficient, accurate language is - 'late wife?'  \n\n'First wife?'", "This is his late wife, not his ex-wife.  Your feelings are valid, so in terms of feeling hurt and frustrated, NTA.  It can be an uncomfortable feeling as the new wife.  Had his late wife not died, you would not be together.  Your husband is still grieving, and it sounds like he was not emotionally ready to get remarried. Unfortunately, this happens fairly often when someone loses a spouse, particularly if they have children. Sometimes, people (subconsciously) try to right the universe for their kids when they really aren't ready yet.\n\nIn terms of referring to his late wife as his ex-wife, a very gentle YTA.  Perhaps suggest to your husband that he refer to his late wife as such, or maybe as his former wife, or just by her name.  I can see how hurtful it would be to have her referred to as his wife now that you are married.  Hang in there.", "Soft YTA, but people on here getting mad when even his COWORKERS were getting confused on who he was talking about.

It\u2019s not a \u201cwe just didn\u2019t work out\u201d scenario. It\u2019s not a deadbeat one either. It\u2019s a situation where a man lost his wife, you became the AH when you refer to her anything other than his Late Wife or his Other Wife, have a little heart for the poor man and just explain that it\u2019s also causing confusion for others.

Stop being jealous of a dead woman before you become his real EX wife", "Alright, I've very clearly made a mistake with the language in this post. I was under the impression that an \"ex-anything\" just referred to someone you were once with, but I am seeing now that for a lot of people ex specifically means a breakup. I've spoken to my husband and he says he doesn't use \"late wife\" because it immediately puts a damper on the conversation and makes people think of grief and loss which is not always the best. We're trying to find a way to refer to Alyssa that is comfortable for both of us as \"late wife\" is to heavy \"ex wife\" is too light and \"first wife\" is apparently a no-go because he doesn't like the idea of numbering his wives. \n\nI also see a lot of confusion in the comments which I will try to clear up. I am not trying to replace Alyssa, I would never ask Jane to call me mom, she calls me Lilly, and I am not trying to erase Alyssa's memory either, she was a fantastic woman and a wonderful mother and wife, we have photos of her on our walls,  we remember her all the time and Dan makes sure to raise Jane in a household where she knows how loved she is by everyone including Alyssa and I respect that completely, they had a life before me, they were a family before me, and I am not trying to take that from them  \nI admit, I was definitely an asshole in how I behaved, but I was never asked to be put above Alyssa as a wife, just that my husband would have enough respect for me to differentiate us", "Lady, Alyssa isn\u2019t his ex wife, she\u2019s his LATE WIFE. They\u2019re not exes, she dies. He can still love her and have love in his heart for his wife that died while also loving you. It sounds like you need to do some work to understand the man you married and how death can impact. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re jealous of a dead woman. He\u2019s not in love with a dead person. And it\u2019s super unfair of you to ask him to refer to her as his ex wife. If anything, you need to come at him with compassion before making any demands and even then the only adjustment i would make is to ask him to refer to her as his late wife. Although i\u2019m sure MANY widowers still refer to their late partners in the present tense even when they remarry. Y\u2019all can coexist in his heart damn.", "She\u2019s not his ex! She\u2019s his late wife! YTA", "YTA for calling his late wife his ex wife for a start. She is not his ex wife and you should never ever expect him to say that and you need to get the idea that is what she is out of your head.\n\nYou can ask him to specify late wife I guess. When talking to people who may be confused and think he means you. Or just use her name. But do not ever expect him to think of her as an ex.\n\nEither get over the fact she is not an ex or get out of the marriage. You should never have married a widow if you have this expectation.", "NTA. That would be confusing and embarrassing also for anyone he's talking to that might not realize she passed away.\n\nShe isn't really an ex-wife since that's usually a divorce, but there's no reason not to refer to her as his first wife and you as current wife.\n\nEdit: Actually, Late wife/husband is what most widows/widowers use to refer to a deceased spouse.", "YTA. She's not his ex wife, she's his late wife. They didn't divorce, she died. That's the only reason he's not still married to her. Stop being so jealous of a dead woman. \n\nPoor child having to deal with this. Her father made a terrible mistake marrying too soon.", "YTA. For one thing, it's not his ex-wife, it's his late wife. He was married to her before you and she passed. Why are you playing semantics and being jealous of a dead person? I just had a friend lose her husband not even two months ago. If someone told her not to refer to her late husband as her husband, she'd probably react the same way your husband did.", "NTA maybe the right term is \"late wife\" but I don't think you're an asshole for wanting to be differentiated from his dead wife.

You cant force someone through grief or fight your way into their grieving heart. \n\nYou should to strongly consider moving on, giving him some space and letting him come back when and if he is ready. \n\nDon\u2019t have a baby with this guy. That will be the worst thing you can do.", "NTA. Your husband should respect your feelings and not refer to his ex-wife as his wife.", "I understand that she isn't an ex, but he should call her his late wife. It is very confusing to other people when he refers to her that way at some point you have to move past. The fact that your wife is no longer there. Yes it's hard and yes it sad but to call her. Your wife when you're married again is very confusing. It's not about not loving previous wife it's just a matter of technically not married anymore due to being deceased and that is considered his late wife not his wife I would also like to add that's very confusing to other people especially if God for bid something happens medically or what not and people are so confused they don't know who he's talking about because technically when you die, you are no longer married my mother just lost her husband. That is a late husband, it's not to be disrespectful but it also is very confusing especially God forbid something happens people who is he is talking about", "Yeah, NTA\n\nI wonder if he's really done with the grieving process or if you're just a placeholder because the key player is not available anymore.\n\nBut not seeing how such a small thing hurts you and not being willing to fix it or even acknowledge it as issue because \"technically we never divorced\" is a d1ck move. He's fine with humiliating you \n\nThere are sooo many options: first wife, late wife, daughter's mum. You name it. I wonder if he just doesn't care and thinks you'll get over it (great precedent to build a life) ?", "NTA. The wording \"ex\" instead of \"late\" or \"first' isn't kind and you should apologize for THAT, but he needs to make that distinction. He's putting you in a really awkward position and to STILL be talking about her as his wife when YOU are his now wife isn't fair. He's also putting OTHER people in uncomfortable situations. I mean, his friend trying to talk to you about baseball must have felt really awkward about it...   \n\n\nI agree, if he wasn't ready to move on, he shouldn't have married you. If he's going to keep calling her his wife and putting you in awkward spots, talk it through or leave if it bothers you.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong.

From what it sounds like he is talking like his first wife never died and he is only talking about her. Is he even talking about u to his coworkers?", "YTA\n\nShe isn't his ex wife. You could be more empathetic, and ask that he refer to her as \"his late wife\", for clarity's sake.

However, he just needs to change the wording to late wife.", "I\u2019m sorry but NTA. Aside from using the wrong phrase, th husband  is calling someone else his wife to the extent that friends think they are talking about his current wife. He should at least be encouraged to use the phrase late wife.", "I would say ESH. Yes he's widowed but it's been 4 years. Healing takes a lot of time but still actively talking to people as if it's the same wife as OP is a bit much. He might need therapy if he hasn't already.To reiterate, I'm not saying he can't grieve or should just get over it, just that it's off-putting with how long the relationship has been.\n\n\n\"We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow.

I definitely thinks it\u2019s something that the two of you need to have a conversation about and listen to each other.", "YTA. He should probably be referring to her as his late wife, however, she will never be his ex-wife.", "YTA - sorry, she's not his ex wife so why would he call her that? She's his wife that died. He's a widower. A widower would not call someone they loved and didn't divorce an ex. He's probably always going to love her and that's a thing you should have understood when you married a widower.\n\nIf you can get passed this and want to stay with him, I'd make the suggestion he call her first wife, that way his friends will know he isn't talking about you and it still gives you recognition as the 2nd wife.", "NTA. Yes she\u2019s his late wife and not his ex wife, but I can understand being annoyed that people think he\u2019s talking about you when he talks about her. He needs to start referring to her as his late wife. People on here are tripping calling you an AH.", "ESH. Alyssa is his FIRST wife, not his ex. You'd better damn sure not describe her that way.\n\nBut Daniel definitely shouldn't have gotten married if he still feels married to Alyssa. He moved on too fast.

You don\u2019t get over the event of someone you deeply love existing one second to never being able to talk to them again, it\u2019s something you just have to deal with. Him talking about her is just a way of keeping her memory alive and feeling close to her in a way.

We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow. We ended up quarantining together and after 3 years we decided to tie the knot. The wedding ceremony was everything a girl could dream of and we've honestly had very few issues in our first year as a couple. It wasn't until we went to pick up Jane from her summer camp that I started seeing an issue\r  \nI went to meet up with him at the front desk, I found him chatting with the camp coordinator which is all well and good until I overheard what he was saying. He mentioned that \"my wife made me this jacket actually, she was really good at all that sewing stuff\". He was referring to his ex-wife(Alyssa for privacy) NOT me. It bugged me a little but I brushed it off as a one-time thing, an accident. We don't talk about Alyssa much unless we're around Jane, and even then he usually refers to her as \"Jane's mom\", I never heard him call her his wife, especially now that WE were married.\r  \nIt wasn't until a week or two later that I learned he does this a lot. We were at a get-together with some friends from work, my first time meeting them. It was all good until one of them asked me questions about baseball. I admitted I didn't know much about the sport and he said that was weird because Daniel had mentioned I was really good at the game and even played some in college, it left me very confused. After talking to some more guys I found out this was a common issue, a lot of them thought Alyssa and I were the same person because Dan called us both his wife. At this point I got really offended, we had been married for 10 months and he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet, I was super awkward and explaining to people that he still called his ex-wife his wife was utterly humiliating, especially the amount he does it, not just one or two people but the whole office.\r  \nWhen we got home we fought. He said he didn't even think about it that way, that since he never divorced Alyssa he never stopped thinking about her as his wife, he still stands by the fact that Alyssa is his wife, despite how embarrassing it is to explain to people that I'm not his second wife but rather his new wife and Alyssa his ex. I told him that if he wasn't ready to move on then he shouldn't have married me, if he can't commit to being my husband then he shouldn't get to call me his wife. I spent the next night at my sister's house ignoring his calls, we recently started to smooth things over by not talking about them but I can tell that this is going to be a sore spot in the marriage I am trying so desperately to save.\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But you suck a lot because you ahev to recognize that he has suffered a big loss and that she was an important part of his life and that she will always have a place in his heart, especially that they had a child together. You need to be more understanding. Instead of fighting, just share how you feel and give him a chance to explain.", "YTA. Yeah your husband probably could've made it clear   to people when referencing his late wife or you, but he's not his ex. She passed away. They did not get a divorce. Insisting he calls her his ex is 1) going to make people assume that she's still around, which is not any better and 2) disrespectful as all heck. \n\nTell him it's actually annoying when people confused you and his late wife, which is very valid. Give him some grace while he gets used to referring to you as wife and Alyssa late wife (or just her name if he prefers). But you don't get to tell him the definition of \"ex\" and making it a bigger issue than it is.

I suggest that maybe suggesting him address her as \u201chis late wife\u201d. That would make a more distinction between you two. But it is an asshole move of yours to expect him to erase her or to expect him to not honour her. It is an asshole move to acting out while you\u2019re threatened by her.

Maybe she\u2019s a slight ah for that, but it really boils down to a little education about why precise language matters when communicating. \n\nThat said, I do see her point. If her husband was referring to Alyssa as his late wife in conversation, then the listener automatically understands that he is a widower and OP is his second wife. It would make things a lot less confusing. I totally hear where  she is coming from that it is embarrassing to interact with people that were told one thing about \u201cyou\u201d ie, \u201cthe wife\u201d and be left confused what they are talking about or have to correct people. It\u2019s also humiliating for the husband to call his late wife \u201chis wife\u201d when his new wife is standing right there. It doesn\u2019t seem like OP wants to erase Alyssa or sweep her existence under the rug, she just wants to be acknowledged as her husband\u2019s partner. Which is totally fair. \n\nSo I think that it\u2019s an ESH situation. Both OP and her husband need to use \u201clate wife\u201d when talking about Alyssa and that would clear up the confusion and avoid embarrassment for OP.", "He should call her his late wife", "I think they that they are both in the wrong.\n\nOP is in the wrong due to her wording (the irony I know), because his *late* wife, is NOT an ex. She died and he is widowed. \n\nHowever, he SHOULD be referring to her, as his late wife. That way people can understand the context when he switches between referring to his deceased spouse and current one. He should not be speaking in a way that she is being commonly confused with his late wife. \n\nI see one way forward here with splitting paths. Perhaps, because she is still his (first) wife forever in his mind, because they did not divorce, it has never occurred to him to refer to her as his late wife, but he needs to do so.\n\nIf OP brings this issue up to him plain and simple and says, hey, I understand she will forever be your first wife and she is not an ex but deceased,  but I do need you to refer to her as your late wife to avoid confusion and because I am currently your wife, and he balks and won\u2019t do so, then he is not ready to be married. If he simply cannot handle to even refer to his deceased wife as such, he has not grieved and moved on in a way where he should be dating, let alone married.\n\nTherefore, I can understand OPs frustration, but I am put off by her reference to his deceased wife as an ex wife.

You\u2019re also a step parent now\u2026 consider how talking like this in front of a child about her mom would sound, consider how difficult this position is for your husband, and apologize. Maybe do a little more research on dating a widower because you should have already done that and this post shows you didn\u2019t. Accept that YTA for this but move on and make an example of a humble apology for step kid, then show your husband how moving on looks. There\u2019s an excellent mini Ted talk on grief that I listened to before my Daniel died, because he was also a widower and I wanted to understand- the base line is that the life you have now would not exist if Alyssa was around, and rather than face that fact with insecurity you need to accept it with grace and show your family that including you is not erasing her, but building new traditions in that honor her memory.", "Couldn't agree more.

I get along with both women and see all my kids regularly, so it often comes up that I'm talkong about \"kid 1's mom\" or \"kid 2 and 3's mom\"\n\nIt works, and as far as I know it's not insulting to either of them.

And I feel so bad for OP because if he has been saying \u201chis wife\u201d but the receiver of the conversation has no idea which wife he is referring to, she couldn\u2019t have had this talk sooner. And if the daughter over hears him saying the same thing, when OP isn\u2019t around to correct him, how is she to know the difference either?

OP\u2019s subconscious feels Alyssa is more like an ex-wife because she didn\u2019t have a relationship with her & in her mind she is dealing with most of the after effects a divorce can cause. So her mind thinks ex. His mind isn\u2019t made up on any term at all, so he says wife.

Really harsh that OP has to tell people she's just met about everything", "Late wife, or first wife. Either works. He can elaborate if questioned. But he really should be only using the term \"wife\" on it's own for the current one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, understandable how he still thinks of her as his wife due to lack of divorce, but the \"till death do us part\" section of the vows kinda covers this.", "Tbh I learnt on Reddit that ex means someone you broke up with/divorced.\n\nWe have a version of late in my language but it's more like old language, I have only seen it in books. If I had less linguistic knowledge (both in french and english) I would have referred to a deceased spouse as an Ex. Because the way you see that word used, it usually ends up meaning \"My former partner/spouse that I am not involved with anymore in a romantic way\".", "Or OP didn't think all the threads through thoroughly when they thought of getting people riled up with some ex wife/late wife young adult fiction", "It's also fairly fresh really from what i can see, it would take me a lot longer to get used to referring to my person I lost as my late spouse because I'd forget constantly I expect. He doesn't seem to have been a widower that long. I wonder if this may have been a speed up relationship because covid put them together quicker than normal.\n\nI understand ops frustration, but he should be saying late and not ex like she wants. He never divorced her she was taken from him, and that's very different. It may be more difficult for op to square away, though, but she will always be competing with a dead lady if she can't make peace with it.", "He needs to go to therapy then because it's the reality of the situation and it's been 4 years", "Like maybe the asshole is the widower who marries another person who is not ready to move on. Yes, I get it. Grieving matters, and they deserve another chance, but if someone wants to be in a relationship, they should always be #1, especially in a marriage. It seems like OP's husband just wants a live-in maid ugh", "but then people will inevitably ask who is Alyssa", "Reddit loves widowers disrespecting their current partners and, even more importantly, assumes everyone is from the strictly same American (and a certain demographic of it) background. So they are all fossilized on thinking that OP meant \"ex\" with oh such malicious intents when it's clearly not the case lol", "Glad im not the only one confused by the top vote. If anything at most esh. But id say nta since everything falls on her and he is just being stubborn", "Yes he should differenciate them both because he is talking about two different people. She has the right to be angry, he can't just call them both wife because he is also confusing people.", "Lol thanks! And yeah, she\u2019s really got a tough one on her hands", "I assume that most of the man's friends and collegues know who she was. And to new people he can introduce her as Janes mother Alyssa.", "Yeah. In my language, the word we have for \"late\" is old enough that you'll only read it in books or hear it from elders. I'm pretty sure not many people would have an issue if you referred to a deceased spouse as an \"ex\" because most people don't have any other word other than, well ... Deceased. Dead. \n\nAnd I genuinely believe that the actual issue OP is going through (aka people mixing her up with her husband's dead wife) is slightlyyy more important than her oopsing the specific word used to refer to aforementioned wife.", "ESH and even then ... I'm of the opinion that not using the right word to refer to his late wife (which, from OP's own admission, is just a mistake, she didn't know better) isn't worth getting the AH title. Especially when on the other side of the issue people mix you up with a dead person because your husband can't bring himself to use the term \"late\" or \"first\", and you end up being the one who needs to initiate the awkward conversations to fix the misunderstanding.", "Tell him to use 'late wife ' or her name. If he doesn't agree , leave.", "You're NTA and absolutely correct that he should not have married you if he hasn't come to terms with his LATE wife's passing where he is still calling her his wife and confusing people.", "You were shocked by the time you got to the 4th word of the title? Just messing with you.   I totally get what you are saying.  I was more shocked that the late wife played some baseball in college.  It's very common for guys to play slow pitch softball but I haven't really heard of women playing baseball outside of A league of their Own and maybe some countries like Japan or South Korea.", "Yeah, if someone told me that their wife was really good at baseball, I would likely assume she doesn't play anymore as she got older and started a family, not that she passed away. Not saying that the husband was in the wrong here, but I know someone who was in a similar situation and refers to his late wife and his new wife by their names rather than just 'wife', which I do agree could be rather confusing.", "Same in my language. You have to be really explicit and basically say \"my dead partner\"... which isn't always the preferred choice of words.\n\nSome people want to make sure they are conveying the exact meaning (= making sure people know they never divorced or break up from their late spouse), and it's totally fair. Others are ok with being more generic and use \"ex\", and it's ok as well. \n\nAnd yes, Reddit decided that a word \"error\" was more important than the key point of the post lol", "Exactly this. I refer to my husband as my late husband.", "Or maybe she just doesn't want to be put in situations where people assume she's her husband's previous wife? Wouldn't have thought it's that unreasonable.", "People take language way too seriously. And that comes from someone who really likes linguistic stuff. Like, would have studied languages if I didn't go into art type of person.\n\nLanguage exists to make communication easy between us, it's a tool, a tool that many people don't know how to use correctly. Because they lack education, or struggle with the meanings and contextual use of words, or because they come from a different cultural background ... And many other reasons. The idea behind the words is the most important, you can always clear up things if there is a misunderstanding.\n\nThis whole thread is unnecessary, by witch hunting OP for litteraly misusing a little word, they completely ignored the core of the issue. Thankfully from the update, OP is currently finding a solution with her husband, so there's that at least.\n\nBut, like- gee Reddit, calm the fuck down lmao.", "It could be worse if he referred to OP as \u201ccurrent wife\u201d", "Yeah I'm honestly shocked by the number of people treating into her for this. It really felt quite clear that she doesn't appreciate being put in these situations, and her husband is refusing to consider her feelings in the matter. Like, you've married twice my dude, learn to accept this fact and just make it clear which wife you are referring to when you talk about them.", "Like many questions on Reddit, I think more communication to each other instead of us is the answer and I wish you both well.", "Maybe there is a language barrier, not every language has a word for \"late\" -spouse", "The post is not about the phrasing. It doesn\u2019t even say that she requested the phrasing \u2018ex wife\u2019 in the argument with him. The post is clearly about her having to explain to people she\u2019s just met that they\u2019re thinking of a different person, and in fact he is no longer married to the previous partner because she died. As she said, that is very humiliating and should have been clarified by her husband rather than by her", "NTA, I don't understand all these crazy comments. He shouldn't marry you if he wasn't over his dead wife. Simple.", "NTA. Ok yes you got it wrong saying the 'ex' instead of 'late' but now Reddit has told you, you know to say 'late' and are owning it.\n\nThe actual issue here is him talking about his 'two' wives interchangeably, leading to confusing people and not being aware of how this could make you feel. It doesn't sound like you're trying to do the whole 'replace her' - so let's keep it simple. I don't think he's an AH either, he just needs to see others' PoV, very much including yours.\n\nGood to hear you're both now having the conversation to find a solution that works for you guys. No one's an AH it's just awkward life things we learn along the way.", "NTA, I may be downvoted to hell but how are you supposed to form your own identity outside and within the relationship if he doesn\u2019t change how he speaks about you both? I do believe that he should say late wife instead of ex wife, as she did pass away but it\u2019s ridiculous.", "**NTA - I am 100% with you on this OP.**\n\nI think it's totally unfair on you and so degrading, for him to call his dead wife \"his wife\".\n\nAnd talk to his friends like she's still alive and she is his current wife.\n\nLike you don't even exist, you're just a physical body that fills a void while he's still mentally and emotionally married to his wife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd saying he still thinks of himself as married to her means...he's not 100% invested in you and he never will be.\n\nHe should've stayed single till he worked this out in his head. He can't mess with other people like this. Totally unfair on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest you do what he can't - move on with your life.", "NTA\n\nYou are in an unusual predicament and I strongly suggest asking your husband to consider counseling with you. It is not unreasonable to ask that he use the term \"late wife\", but I would drop the \"ex wife\" bit. Best of luck to you.", "NTAH I agree with some saying \u201clate wife\u201d instead of ex-wife, but REGARDLESS him calling you both wife is very confusing to others and a bit disrespectful to you. If i read correctly you said you two dated for 3 years before marrying (I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a certain time limit to grieve the loss of a spouse), but i agree with what you said. If he wasn\u2019t fully ready to move on, he should not have moved on. He clearly see\u2019s the difference in how he refer to his late wife in front of you hence him referring to her as \u201cJane\u2019s mom\u201d, so why would it be so \u201cnatural\u201d for him to still refer to her as his wife to everyone else? That i don\u2019t quite understand. Why or how could he still stand by the fact that she is still his wife? That union unfortunately is over and he\u2019s very clearly committed to another. He needs to try to atleast look at it from you perspective and take into account your feelings on this topic. I definitely think it shouldn\u2019t be swept under the rug, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something to lose a marriage over just yet. Hopefully it all works out!", "People are getting very caught up in ex wife vs late wife, but I don't think you're an asshole here. The Y T As are BAFFLING.\n\nHe is actively talking about his first wife as if she is alive. That is very concerning. In your comment you said he doesn't want the awkwardness of saying late wife, but he is then *forcing that awkwardness onto you* when you have to correct people that *you are not the wife he is constantly talking about*. I know you love him OP, but I don't think he loves you. He never got over his first wife, and seems to be using you as a placeholder while continuing to tell everyone about his real wife\n\nI'm so sorry OP, but he needs extensive therapy and you both need couples therapy if there is a hope in hell of this marriage working. Because he is not thinking about you, caring about you, or respecting you. And he can't even see what he's done wrong. That's horrible and you dont deserve that", "NTA - He didn't have to say EX-wife, as it reads as she passed and there was no divorce. He can say his first wife,  his daughters mother, his wife that passed,  or use her name to clarify who he is talking about. Westernized marriage vows end with till death do us part, meaning that no, she isn't still his wife. It may have been tragic and unexpected, but that chapter ended. He needs to respect his living, breathing wife now.", "So confused about everyone calling op TA. Reddit is weird", "She\u2019s his late wife, and he should call her as such. This is a huge problem since you obviously didn\u2019t know he still feels like he\u2019s married to her and you\u2019re the \u201eother\u201c wife. Or more second class wife. He should be 100% committed to you, it\u2019s absolutely fine if he\u2019d say his late wife or janes mom or her name, it\u2019s normal that he talks about her and everything, but you are his wife now. And he\u2019s either with you, 100%, or still with her. Then you need to cut the ties, as hard as it is. You live in her shadow and it seems like it won\u2019t change if you don\u2019t set straight boundaries. Either he accepts them or not, but you don\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. You deserve so much better.", "I think OP\u2019s husband is the AH. \n\nHe can just say late wife and clear all this up. \n\nHe\u2019s insisting on calling both of them wife, which feels like he\u2019s being willfully obtuse for no reason.", "Too many people are getting caught up on her terminology rather than the substance of her post. She clearly doesn't care if he uses the term ex or late. The point is that he needs to distinguish between his living wife and his late wife. Calling her the a-hole when the man doesn't even want to use late wife (according to her new comment) seems like a reach.", "She said she isn't trying to erase the late wife. He says wife all the time, not late wife.\n\nHe is the one who is immature and can't handle saying late wife because \"people get awkward\". Instead he forces his current wife to explain who he is talking about, making it way more awkward.\n\nAlso, if the issue comes up that often he talks about his late wife way too much. So saying late wife might make it awkward too since people will realize that he keeps talking about Alyssa instead of his living wife.", "If I were one of the coworkers and found out after all this time talking to the dude that he is still calling his late wife his wife, without differentiating from the current one, I'd be thinking that he's not ready for his current wife, and would be feeling sorry for OP.

He\u2019s the asshole.", "Exactly. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be remarried.", "This also may not trigger the pity that he is probably wanting to avoid.", ">I am confused by the YTA vote being on top\n\nThe top post is the asshole in this situation!

The use of \"second wife\" here is because if Alyssa is his wife, and OP is also his wife, then OP is the other wife or second wife.\n\nAlso, my impression is that people are getting too hung up on OP's use of the term \"ex-wife\".\n\nThe point of contention of this post is the fact that the husband refers to both Alyssa and OP as wife, which causes confusion.\n\nNowhere in the post is she insisting that the husband specifically uses the words \"ex-wife\". It could be just that she is confused as to what the correct term is.\n\nOf course, I, too, can't be sure.\n\nETA: I mean, not every English speaker has perfect domain of words, especially if they are not a native speaker.
