We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow. We ended up quarantining together and after 3 years we decided to tie the knot. The wedding ceremony was everything a girl could dream of and we've honestly had very few issues in our first year as a couple. It wasn't until we went to pick up Jane from her summer camp that I started seeing an issue\n\nI went to meet up with him at the front desk, I found him chatting with the camp coordinator which is all well and good until I overheard what he was saying. He mentioned that \"my wife made me this jacket actually, she was really good at all that sewing stuff\". He was referring to his ex-wife(Alyssa for privacy) NOT me. It bugged me a little but I brushed it off as a one-time thing, an accident. We don't talk about Alyssa much unless we're around Jane, and even then he usually refers to her as \"Jane's mom\", I never heard him call her his wife, especially now that WE were married.\n\nIt wasn't until a week or two later that I learned he does this a lot. We were at a get-together with some friends from work, my first time meeting them. It was all good until one of them asked me questions about baseball. I admitted I didn't know much about the sport and he said that was weird because Daniel had mentioned I was really good at the game and even played some in college, it left me very confused. After talking to some more guys I found out this was a common issue, a lot of them thought Alyssa and I were the same person because Dan called us both his wife. At this point I got really offended, we had been married for 10 months and he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet, I was super awkward and explaining to people that he still called his ex-wife his wife was utterly humiliating, especially the amount he does it, not just one or two people but the whole office.\n\nWhen we got home we fought. He said he didn't even think about it that way, that since he never divorced Alyssa he never stopped thinking about her as his wife, he still stands by the fact that Alyssa is his wife, despite how embarrassing it is to explain to people that I'm not his second wife but rather his new wife and Alyssa his ex. I told him that if he wasn't ready to move on then he shouldn't have married me, if he can't commit to being my husband then he shouldn't get to call me his wife. I spent the next night at my sister's house ignoring his calls, we recently started to smooth things over by not talking about them but I can tell that this is going to be a sore spot in the marriage I am trying so desperately to save.", "created_utc": 1693177284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16351bt/aita_for_telling_my29f_husband34m_not_to_call_his/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You HAVE to stop saying \"ex\" wife. They didn't divorce. You just have to stop using that term. However, she is his LATE wife and you *both* need to start using that term to refer to her. It's disrespectful of you to call her his ex, and it's disrespectful of him to talk about her in a way that makes people think you and her are the same person. \n\nShe is his late wife, you are his current wife. It's not that complicated.", "It\u2019s not his ex wife\u2026 he\u2019s widowed. I have never been widowed, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a hard adjustment to make. Maybe he should say late wife because she\u2019s not his ex.\n\nEdited to add- Soft YTA. I say this because I understand how you feel, but at the same time I understand how it may be weird for him to say ex because she\u2019s not his ex.", "YTA\n\nShe's not his ex. He is her widower. There is a whole world of difference between a marriage that ends in divorce, and a marriage that ends in the death of one of the partners. If you can't cope with the fact that he can love both you and his late wife, then you shouldn't have married him. You are completely at fault here.", "ESH.  She is his late wife not his ex wife.", "I can understand as a new wife, hearing this is probably uncomfortable and he really shouldn\u2019t have gotten into a relationship/marriage with you until he had enough time to grieve it sounds like. It\u2019s unfortunate but there should\u2019ve been a talk in the beginning because I really don\u2019t think a year after his wife\u2019s death has really allowed him enough time to grieve. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how hard it is to once refer to someone as their wife for so long, and then they pass way and now he has to say \u201clate wife\u201d, so for that reason it really does seem he shouldn\u2019t have gotten straight into a long-term commitment with someone and should\u2019ve took the time to heal. I think therapy for him is the best option as he navigates and goes through his grief and also marriage counseling for the both of you. I don\u2019t think either of you know how to deal with this situation because it\u2019s definitely a sensitive circumstance to be put in. Both of you need support in different ways so I think counseling and creating that level of communication will ultimately help you in your marriage. \n\nI know it\u2019s been said in this thread multiple times, but please be careful about how you refer to his late wife as an \u201cex-wife\u201d, because that\u2019s incredibly offensive to her and to him. From personal experience, my mom died when I was a kid and I mistakenly referred to her as my dad\u2019s ex-wife because I was too young and had no idea about the term \u201clate wife\u201d and I\u2019ll never forget the hurt on my dad\u2019s face once I said it and I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it probably felt for him.", "YTA. Alyssa is not is ex wife. It's his late wife.\n\nIf you don't want to have to deal with a late wife and a man's past, don't marry a widower with bagage and try to erase a part of his life.", "YTA. A deceased spouse is not an ex-spouse.\n\nIf you can't accept that he had a wife, the mother of his child, don't marry a widower. She is and will always be part of his life, because she helped to make it what it now is.\n\nI can understand being upset that people were confusing you, but you went way out of line about this.\n\nHonestly, if I were him, I would struggle to forgive a lot of what you said.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s not his ex-wife and you can\u2019t expect him to call her that.\n\nBut he\u2019s making a habit of being unclear about your marriage and it\u2019s actually confusing people. It seems like he might have some unprocessed grief. \n\nInstead of being jealous of a dead woman, try talking to your husband about what he\u2019s been feeling lately. You should talk about his late wife together, not just for the child. It\u2019s healthy.", "Gentle YTA - It is his late wife. Ex-wife would mean he was divorced. It's going to be a transition for him, and for you. You are going to have to be patient, as perhaps this marriage happened too quickly for both of you. If you cannot respect that this will take time, maybe you should move on.", "I think he needs to refer to his deceased wife as his late wife, never the ex-wife.  She will always be a part of their lives. I don't think it is fair to the new wife for him not to differentiate between the two wives. Perhaps couples therapy would help them work through this. No one is the AH, just a lot of confusion and emotions.", "She will NEVER be an \u201cex\u201d to him. She is his LATE wife which you clearly don\u2019t respect.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: you do realize even she were alive and the \u201cex\u201d you\u2019d ALWAYS be the 2nd wife? That\u2019s just how it works? \n\nYTA", "Maybe you can ask him to say \u201cmy late wife\u201d. She\u2019s not an ex. But I get you wanting the recognition of being his actual wife. I\u2019m going to say NAH but please do not continue to call her his ex wife because I\u2019m sure that angers him and it\u2019s not factual. Like if you\u2019re communicating through this, you have to look at the FACTS. And the fact is that she passed, not that they divorced.", "NAH. He\u2019s mourning and it\u2019s hard to say \u201cex\u201d when it\u2019s not like divorce but death but it\u2019s also not fair to you to be put in those awkward situations. I was more Y T A until the examples made it clear he\u2019s doing a terrible job at differentiating when talking to others and setting you up for awkwardness. \n\nLike many questions on Reddit, I think more communication to each other instead of us is the answer and I wish you both well.", "I would say overall..esh. instead of trying to have him say \"exwife\" when talking about her, maybe ask him to call her his \"late wife\"when he talks about her to others. She isn't his ex because she died. I understand you feeling upset because of having to correct other people as well as it make you feel lesser than, but maybe try wording it differently when talking about the situation. \nYou both need to sit down and talk it out. Maybe ask him what he loves about you? You mentioned all the things he has talked about his late wife and how it was confusing because it wasn't stuff you did. I am nosey, Has he ever bragged about you?", "YTA. She isn\u2019t his ex wife. She is his late wife, or his first wife. You are his current wife, his second wife, whether you like it or not.", "YTA. You mean his late wife, the mother of his child, the woman that died while still being married to Daniel. \nI was going for ESH because I kinda get that you do not want to be on the same level as an ex but here is the deal you are not. I get that it might be annoying but it feels like he has some unprocessed grief or does not know how to handle the situation respectfully. That is why I would say that his \u201eoffense\u201c is less. He seems to have a thought time handling the situation.", "You need to grow up and learn that Alyssa isn\u2019t his ex wife. Jealously is ugly. YTA", ">  he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet  \n  \nLook this is difficult with who should be calling who what and all but she fucking died. He certainly shouldn't be calling her the ex and you should be a little less aggressive with your quest to have him change the nomenclature for his DEAD wife. Right now I don't think you'd get the same naming convention if something were to happen to you. Honestly ESH.", "She's not his EX, she's his LATE wife. I can certainly understand why hearing him call her his wife is upsetting, and he should respect that and make an effort to change what he calls her, but the proper term is LATE wife, or first wife if he doesn't want to get into a whole discussion around his widowhood.", "She\u2019s isn\u2019t an \u201cex-wife\u201d. She is his \u201clate-wife.\u201d I get why you are upset at the confusion but you are going to have to accept that and maybe request he use the term late-wife whenever he refers to her with others. You shouldn\u2019t have married a widower if you can\u2019t accept that she will always be part of his and his child\u2019s life. Sorry. Try and have some grace though. You can\u2019t erase her and if you try it will be met with resentment by him and his child. Soft YTA because I understand, but you are still in the wrong.", "First off, you\u2019ve been married for almost a year and dated for 3 and got together right before the pandemix, do you mean a year before the pandemic? Otherwise the math doesn\u2019t quite match up to me. It\u2019s still rather fresh that he\u2019s remarried even after 4 or 5 years of her having passed. \n\nThe fact that you called her his ex wife is pretty sucky and wrong. There\u2019s a huge difference. My boyfriend died in 2014, I would never refer to him as my ex boyfriend. Late wife or late boyfriend is a bit better in terms of being clear but when talking about him in the past tense I still use boyfriend often and I\u2019m married now. I usually explain he passed, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making it seem I have a boyfriend and a husband. \n\nI also didn\u2019t even date for a year and a half and it took me years still to fully engage in my next relationship. It\u2019s a hard thing to move forward from and we didn\u2019t even have children. \n\nYTA for having no sense of respect for this situation.", "ESH. \n1. Daniel needs to clarify Alyssa as his late wife and you as his 2nd wife when talking to people to avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\n2. You need to correct your descriptors of Alyssa from Ex- to Late since Daniel and Alyssa were never divorced and you calling her an Ex is disrespectful.", "YTA. The only way she would be his ex wife is if they\u2019d divorced. Sure, he could have said \u201clate wife\u201d or something like that, but she will never be his ex. She is always going to hold that place in his heart, and demanding that he change that mindset is never going to end well for you.", "YTA.  She\u2019s not his ex-wife.  So he\u2019s never going to want to call her that.  It\u2019s inaccurate and sounds harsh.  Late wife is more accurate.  I can understand that it may cause a little confusion to call her his wife. In the case of the jacket he was talking about when/how he got it and she was his wife at the time.  You need to let this go though.  She\u2019s dead.  You don\u2019t need to be jealous of her.", "ESH.  While I get the awkward situation he has you in, you need to communicate that in order to make it not awkward, he should refer to her as his \"late wife\" as she passed, they didn't divorce.  Both of you need to discuss this situation and not just ignore it as an attempt to smooth things over.", "Ex wife doesn't make sense.  \n\nBut neither does just 'wife.'  \n\nI'm not quite sure what the best, efficient, accurate language is - 'late wife?'  \n\n'First wife?'", "This is his late wife, not his ex-wife.  Your feelings are valid, so in terms of feeling hurt and frustrated, NTA.  It can be an uncomfortable feeling as the new wife.  Had his late wife not died, you would not be together.  Your husband is still grieving, and it sounds like he was not emotionally ready to get remarried. Unfortunately, this happens fairly often when someone loses a spouse, particularly if they have children. Sometimes, people (subconsciously) try to right the universe for their kids when they really aren't ready yet.\n\nIn terms of referring to his late wife as his ex-wife, a very gentle YTA.  Perhaps suggest to your husband that he refer to his late wife as such, or maybe as his former wife, or just by her name.  I can see how hurtful it would be to have her referred to as his wife now that you are married.  Hang in there.", "Soft YTA, but people on here getting mad when even his COWORKERS were getting confused on who he was talking about.

It\u2019s not a \u201cwe just didn\u2019t work out\u201d scenario. It\u2019s not a deadbeat one either. It\u2019s a situation where a man lost his wife, you became the AH when you refer to her anything other than his Late Wife or his Other Wife, have a little heart for the poor man and just explain that it\u2019s also causing confusion for others. But do not tell him to call his dead wife an \u201cex wife\u201d she is not.", "YTA\n\nshe isn't an ex. you need to accept the unfortunate reality that in a way he will always love his late wife, you will not win this battle. you should emulate the respect and patience he exhibits that made you attracted to him in the first place. this sort of grief is complicated but it's one you signed up for. i don't understand why you say \"i'm trying to save my marriage\" like he's the one destroying it. \n\nyou swept your feelings under the rug and now you can't handle it, you should have addressed it the first time it happened.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA\n\nHe should have said BEFORE the marriage that he hadn't moved on.

Stop being jealous of a dead woman before you become his real EX wife", "Alright, I've very clearly made a mistake with the language in this post. I was under the impression that an \"ex-anything\" just referred to someone you were once with, but I am seeing now that for a lot of people ex specifically means a breakup. I've spoken to my husband and he says he doesn't use \"late wife\" because it immediately puts a damper on the conversation and makes people think of grief and loss which is not always the best. We're trying to find a way to refer to Alyssa that is comfortable for both of us as \"late wife\" is to heavy \"ex wife\" is too light and \"first wife\" is apparently a no-go because he doesn't like the idea of numbering his wives. \n\nI also see a lot of confusion in the comments which I will try to clear up. I am not trying to replace Alyssa, I would never ask Jane to call me mom, she calls me Lilly, and I am not trying to erase Alyssa's memory either, she was a fantastic woman and a wonderful mother and wife, we have photos of her on our walls,  we remember her all the time and Dan makes sure to raise Jane in a household where she knows how loved she is by everyone including Alyssa and I respect that completely, they had a life before me, they were a family before me, and I am not trying to take that from them  \nI admit, I was definitely an asshole in how I behaved, but I was never asked to be put above Alyssa as a wife, just that my husband would have enough respect for me to differentiate us", "Lady, Alyssa isn\u2019t his ex wife, she\u2019s his LATE WIFE. They\u2019re not exes, she dies. He can still love her and have love in his heart for his wife that died while also loving you. It sounds like you need to do some work to understand the man you married and how death can impact. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re jealous of a dead woman. He\u2019s not in love with a dead person. And it\u2019s super unfair of you to ask him to refer to her as his ex wife. If anything, you need to come at him with compassion before making any demands and even then the only adjustment i would make is to ask him to refer to her as his late wife. Although i\u2019m sure MANY widowers still refer to their late partners in the present tense even when they remarry. Y\u2019all can coexist in his heart damn.", "She\u2019s not his ex! She\u2019s his late wife! YTA", "YTA for calling his late wife his ex wife for a start. She is not his ex wife and you should never ever expect him to say that and you need to get the idea that is what she is out of your head.\n\nYou can ask him to specify late wife I guess. When talking to people who may be confused and think he means you. Or just use her name. But do not ever expect him to think of her as an ex.\n\nEither get over the fact she is not an ex or get out of the marriage. You should never have married a widow if you have this expectation.", "NTA. That would be confusing and embarrassing also for anyone he's talking to that might not realize she passed away.\n\nShe isn't really an ex-wife since that's usually a divorce, but there's no reason not to refer to her as his first wife and you as current wife.\n\nEdit: Actually, Late wife/husband is what most widows/widowers use to refer to a deceased spouse.", "YTA. She's not his ex wife, she's his late wife. They didn't divorce, she died. That's the only reason he's not still married to her.

He was married to her before you and she passed. Why are you playing semantics and being jealous of a dead person? I just had a friend lose her husband not even two months ago. If someone told her not to refer to her late husband as her husband, she'd probably react the same way your husband did.", "NTA maybe the right term is \"late wife\" but I don't think you're an asshole for wanting to be differentiated from his dead wife.

Is this reality?", "Oh man NAH\n\nHe is not over his wife. The pandemic move in was like trauma bonding and you all needed time to practice in the regular world. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. You cant force someone through grief or fight your way into their grieving heart. \n\nYou should to strongly consider moving on, giving him some space and letting him come back when and if he is ready. \n\nDon\u2019t have a baby with this guy. That will be the worst thing you can do.", "NTA. Your husband should respect your feelings and not refer to his ex-wife as his wife.", "I understand that she isn't an ex, but he should call her his late wife. It is very confusing to other people when he refers to her that way at some point you have to move past. The fact that your wife is no longer there. Yes it's hard and yes it sad but to call her. Your wife when you're married again is very confusing. It's not about not loving previous wife it's just a matter of technically not married anymore due to being deceased and that is considered his late wife not his wife I would also like to add that's very confusing to other people especially if God for bid something happens medically or what not and people are so confused they don't know who he's talking about because technically when you die, you are no longer married my mother just lost her husband. That is a late husband, it's not to be disrespectful but it also is very confusing especially God forbid something happens people who is he is talking about", "Yeah, NTA\n\nI wonder if he's really done with the grieving process or if you're just a placeholder because the key player is not available anymore.\n\nBut not seeing how such a small thing hurts you and not being willing to fix it or even acknowledge it as issue because \"technically we never divorced\" is a d1ck move. He's fine with humiliating you \n\nThere are sooo many options: first wife, late wife, daughter's mum. You name it. I wonder if he just doesn't care and thinks you'll get over it (great precedent to build a life) ?", "NTA. The wording \"ex\" instead of \"late\" or \"first' isn't kind and you should apologize for THAT, but he needs to make that distinction. He's putting you in a really awkward position and to STILL be talking about her as his wife when YOU are his now wife isn't fair. He's also putting OTHER people in uncomfortable situations. I mean, his friend trying to talk to you about baseball must have felt really awkward about it...   \n\n\nI agree, if he wasn't ready to move on, he shouldn't have married you.

From what it sounds like he is talking like his first wife never died and he is only talking about her. Is he even talking about u to his coworkers?", "YTA\n\nShe isn't his ex wife. You could be more empathetic, and ask that he refer to her as \"his late wife\", for clarity's sake.

He should probably refer to her as his late wife but you are making a mountain of a mole hill.\n\n  \nIf you were that concerned about feelings for his former spouse, you probably should not have hooked up with a widower within a year of their spouses death.", "YTA. He just needs to get into the habit of saying his late wife was good at blah blah. She was and will always be a part of his life. However, he just needs to change the wording to late wife.", "I\u2019m sorry but NTA. Aside from using the wrong phrase, th husband  is calling someone else his wife to the extent that friends think they are talking about his current wife. He should at least be encouraged to use the phrase late wife.", "I would say ESH. Yes he's widowed but it's been 4 years. Healing takes a lot of time but still actively talking to people as if it's the same wife as OP is a bit much. He might need therapy if he hasn't already.To reiterate, I'm not saying he can't grieve or should just get over it, just that it's off-putting with how long the relationship has been.\n\n\n\"We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow.

She isn\u2019t his *ex wife* she is his deceased wife. Completely two different things. And it may be hard for him to change the habit even though it\u2019s been a few years. But him dismissing how you feel about it and how embarrassing it is to you wasn\u2019t right either. I definitely thinks it\u2019s something that the two of you need to have a conversation about and listen to each other.", "YTA. He should probably be referring to her as his late wife, however, she will never be his ex-wife.", "YTA - sorry, she's not his ex wife so why would he call her that? She's his wife that died.

Yes she\u2019s his late wife and not his ex wife, but I can understand being annoyed that people think he\u2019s talking about you when he talks about her.

If you weren\u2019t capable of handling all this why did you marry a widow? She is his late wife. You are his second/current wife. There is nothing bad about that.

Who doesn't know the difference between an *ex*-spouse and a *late* spouse at the age of 29? You have to be awfully self-absorbed to feel jealous of a dead woman potentially (not really) replacing you. You need therapy for this.

You guys should try compromising. Alyssa is not his ex, they never broke up. So I wouldn\u2019t push him to call her his ex.

With the person that I\u2019m dating now, if I\u2019m talking about my late bf, I will refer to him as that, or last bf, or by his name..but I would never call him my ex. You\u2019re diminishing who she was to him and pushing him away if you insist on having him call her this. \n\nGrief is not a one time thing, it is something he might have to heal from his whole life. You don\u2019t get over the event of someone you deeply love existing one second to never being able to talk to them again, it\u2019s something you just have to deal with. Him talking about her is just a way of keeping her memory alive and feeling close to her in a way. If you choose to be with him, this is something that you will have to accept because you can\u2019t just force someone to \u201cget over it.\u201d \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t love you fully.

I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s at, maybe he feels torn between you two, and it\u2019s his way of loving both of you and he hasn\u2019t let go yet, but maybe try couples counseling to understand each other better.", "NAH.\n\nShe\u2019s not his ex wife, she\u2019s his former or late or first wife.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo my husband (Daniel for privacy) and I have been married for just under a year and I love him very much, he has an 8 year old daughter (Jane for privacy) from his previous marriage who I love as my own, he's always been respectful and patient which is part of why I decided to marry him. We met right before the pandemic when he had been recently widowed the year before so we tried to take things slow. We ended up quarantining together and after 3 years we decided to tie the knot. The wedding ceremony was everything a girl could dream of and we've honestly had very few issues in our first year as a couple. It wasn't until we went to pick up Jane from her summer camp that I started seeing an issue\r  \nI went to meet up with him at the front desk, I found him chatting with the camp coordinator which is all well and good until I overheard what he was saying. He mentioned that \"my wife made me this jacket actually, she was really good at all that sewing stuff\". He was referring to his ex-wife(Alyssa for privacy) NOT me. It bugged me a little but I brushed it off as a one-time thing, an accident. We don't talk about Alyssa much unless we're around Jane, and even then he usually refers to her as \"Jane's mom\", I never heard him call her his wife, especially now that WE were married.\r  \nIt wasn't until a week or two later that I learned he does this a lot. We were at a get-together with some friends from work, my first time meeting them. It was all good until one of them asked me questions about baseball. I admitted I didn't know much about the sport and he said that was weird because Daniel had mentioned I was really good at the game and even played some in college, it left me very confused. After talking to some more guys I found out this was a common issue, a lot of them thought Alyssa and I were the same person because Dan called us both his wife. At this point I got really offended, we had been married for 10 months and he didn't even call Alyssa his ex-wife yet, I was super awkward and explaining to people that he still called his ex-wife his wife was utterly humiliating, especially the amount he does it, not just one or two people but the whole office.\r  \nWhen we got home we fought. He said he didn't even think about it that way, that since he never divorced Alyssa he never stopped thinking about her as his wife, he still stands by the fact that Alyssa is his wife, despite how embarrassing it is to explain to people that I'm not his second wife but rather his new wife and Alyssa his ex. I told him that if he wasn't ready to move on then he shouldn't have married me, if he can't commit to being my husband then he shouldn't get to call me his wife. I spent the next night at my sister's house ignoring his calls, we recently started to smooth things over by not talking about them but I can tell that this is going to be a sore spot in the marriage I am trying so desperately to save.\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's not his ex wife in any way. They never separated or divorced. Now knowing that it bothers you, he could use the term \"late wife\" (which would be accurate) or even \"first wife\". He sucks a little bit because he knows it bothers you, but continues. But you suck a lot because you ahev to recognize that he has suffered a big loss and that she was an important part of his life and that she will always have a place in his heart, especially that they had a child together. You need to be more understanding. Instead of fighting, just share how you feel and give him a chance to explain.", "YTA. Yeah your husband probably could've made it clear   to people when referencing his late wife or you, but he's not his ex. She passed away. They did not get a divorce. Insisting he calls her his ex is 1) going to make people assume that she's still around, which is not any better and 2) disrespectful as all heck. \n\nTell him it's actually annoying when people confused you and his late wife, which is very valid. Give him some grace while he gets used to referring to you as wife and Alyssa late wife (or just her name if he prefers). But you don't get to tell him the definition of \"ex\" and making it a bigger issue than it is. It's an annoyance, yes, but it doesn't make your bond with him any less strong, or that your marriage needs saving.", "This marriage was a big mistake. I\u2019m sorry hun.

I suggest that maybe suggesting him address her as \u201chis late wife\u201d. That would make a more distinction between you two. But it is an asshole move of yours to expect him to erase her or to expect him to not honour her. It is an asshole move to acting out while you\u2019re threatened by her. You need to communicate and have a conversation. Rather than this.", "Update me", "Esh for your terminology and him because he was not ready to be married again, he's not over his first wife and it feels like you guys just rushed into living together because of the pandemic and the fact that he saw you get along with his daughter and a good female influence was better then none in his eyes. \n\nDid he do any type of grief counseling after she died? I would say he needs some now and you guys could use some family or couples counseling before you guys go any farther and produce another child. \n\nI hope it all works out for everyone involved", "YTA. She isn't his EX wife. She's his LATE wife.

They didn\u2019t break up, separate or divorce. She DIED. She is, was, and always will be his wife, as are you but only because again his late wife died. You can be an ex-wife but she never can.

Maybe she\u2019s a slight ah for that, but it really boils down to a little education about why precise language matters when communicating. \n\nThat said, I do see her point. If her husband was referring to Alyssa as his late wife in conversation, then the listener automatically understands that he is a widower and OP is his second wife. It would make things a lot less confusing. I totally hear where  she is coming from that it is embarrassing to interact with people that were told one thing about \u201cyou\u201d ie, \u201cthe wife\u201d and be left confused what they are talking about or have to correct people. It\u2019s also humiliating for the husband to call his late wife \u201chis wife\u201d when his new wife is standing right there.

Which is totally fair. \n\nSo I think that it\u2019s an ESH situation.

He should not be speaking in a way that she is being commonly confused with his late wife.\n\nI see one way forward here with splitting paths. Perhaps because she is still his wife in his mind, because they did not divorce, it has never occurred to him to refer to her as his late wife, but he needs to do so.\n\nIf OP brings up to him, hey, I understand the situation but you need to refer to her as your late wife to avoid confusion and because I am currently your wife, and he balks and won\u2019t do so, then he is not ready to be married. If his \u201cwife\u201d is still in his mind his late wife, to the point that he cannot even refer to her as such, he has not grieved and moved on in a way where he should be dating, let alone married.\n\nTherefore, I can understand OPs frustration, but I am put off by her reference as an ex wife.
