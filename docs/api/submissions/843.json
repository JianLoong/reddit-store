{"id": 843, "submission_id": "yjrwpg", "title": "AITA for throwing my children's Halloween candy out without explaining ahead of time why?", "selftext": "I (55M) took my two kids (6M, 4F) out for their first trick-or-treat session Monday night (previous 2 years were off-limits due to COVID, and prior to that one/both were too young). \n\nThey were very excited about finally being able to go enjoy the holiday, and put a lot of effort into their costumes given their age. I told them prior to heading out that this was a fun tradition where kids go door-to-door in costume and are given gifts. I said \u201cgifts\u201d because a good portion of my Halloween hauls growing up were non-candy items: toys, spare change, comic books, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also really not a fan of candy in general \u2013 I dealt with major weight issues prior to meeting my wife (40F) and did irrevocable damage to my teeth in my younger years because my parents didn\u2019t set a limit on my candy, Halloween or otherwise. I believe the US confectionary industry pushes this holiday to get kids hooked on sugar and want to protect my children from getting tangled up in that \u2013 they get dental cleanings three times a year even though our insurance only covers the first two. My wife agrees with this approach in general, and when she makes dessert it\u2019s usually a low/zero-sugar affair. She grew up in Poland and has no childhood experiences related to Halloween proper.\n\nAfter we got home from trick-or-treating, my daughter was exhausted and had to be carried up to her bed by my wife after passing out on the couch. I went to the bathroom to freshen up and came out to my son wolfing down candy \u2013 there were 5 or so empty wrappers already on the floor. I don\u2019t know where he got the idea to eat them, as we have NEVER had candy at home \u2013 I guess he may have gotten some at school (he started 1st grade back in August). \n\nI scolded him on how unhealthy it is to pig out like that, took his bucket away from him, filtered out the non-candy, and dumped the sweets in the trash before telling him he needed to clean up the wrappers he left on the floor. He whined \u201cNO\u201d back and stomped off upstairs. I cleaned up the wrappers and threw out the candy from my daughter\u2019s bucket. She was surprised today that she had a lot fewer \u201ctoys\u201d than she did last night but has been way less sulky than my son. \n\nMy wife came downstairs after putting our daughter to bed and was wondering why our son was in such a bad mood, so I explained. She\u2019s not opposed to me drawing a hard line on sugar like that but said I probably should have told them ahead of time about what candy is and why we won\u2019t be holding on to it, instead of assuming both were oblivious. I\u2019m debating just not taking them trick-or-treating in future years, but they both seemed to really enjoy their costumes and their baskets weren\u2019t full of just candy. I\u2019m also debating mentioning this to my son\u2019s teacher and asking if she gives students in her classroom candy, but my wife thinks that\u2019s a bridge too far. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for throwing out my children\u2019s baskets (in front of one of them), and WIBTA if I loop my son\u2019s teacher into all of this?", "created_utc": 1667353170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjrwpg/aita_for_throwing_my_childrens_halloween_candy/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing is as appealing as forbidden fruit. You and are going to cause your children issues around unhealthy, disordered eating. Neither did you need to throw out all the candy. You could've put the candy up, out of your children's reach and dole out however many pieces you deem ok, when you deem it ok. Trauma from your past problem with disordered eating has caused you to become too strict and will likely harm your children and their relationship with food, especially when they're older.

The AH verdict is given because you trampled on your children's feelings over something which was solely theirs - that they had earned, with no warning or explanation.", "Your son just learned the earliest form of disordered eating- hide it so nobody knows and eat it all fast so they don't take it away. I know many families that limit the candy by letting them pick a few favorites and then trade the rest for a toy or game they want.  But giving them complexes about sugar isn't going to help them. I had a very screwed up relationship with food thanks to diet culture and obsession with not eating \"bad\" foods. The only results were weight gain and eating disorders. Gaining a healthy view that no food is bad and learning to listen to what my body needs are the tools that finally stopped my bingeing and bulemia.

I dealt with major weight issues prior to meeting my wife (40F) ...  that's a you problem.

I don\u2019t know where he got the idea to eat them, as we have NEVER had candy at home - okay im sorry there is no way to respond to this without being snarky. You have two kids and you are legitimately shocked they are aware there is candy in the bright crinkly wrappers? Dude. come ON. Also if you never have candy at home congratulations, you've already made it so that candy is not only 'special' but when the kids DO get ahold of it, they're going to hide it, and binge it. Just like your son did here.  \n4. I scolded him on how unhealthy it is to pig out like that, - LOL so you: didn't prepare your kids for dealing with candy, have until now denied them candy, and now your reaction to them being, you know, normal kids, is to take the candy away and punish them. It's like you're TRYING to set them up have an eating disorder. \n5.  probably should have told them ahead of time about what candy is and why we won\u2019t be holding on to it, - this was the only reasonable approach and frankly your wife is an AH for not taking it BEFORE you contributed even further to the problem. \n6. m debating just not taking them trick-or-treating in future years, - LOL  good luck with that and prepare for your kids to resent you for this big time. \n\nYou need help - and i mean that legitimately, not in an insulting way.

They eat 2 pieces Halloween night and one each night  until they\u2019ve run out so that the special treats have lasted no longer than two weeks.

I told them prior to heading out that this was a fun tradition where kids go door-to-door in costume and are given gifts. I said \u201cgifts\u201d because a good portion of my Halloween hauls growing up were non-candy items: toys, spare change, comic books, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also really not a fan of candy in general \u2013 I dealt with major weight issues prior to meeting my wife (40F) and did irrevocable damage to my teeth in my younger years because my parents didn\u2019t set a limit on my candy, Halloween or otherwise. I believe the US confectionary industry pushes this holiday to get kids hooked on sugar and want to protect my children from getting tangled up in that \u2013 they get dental cleanings three times a year even though our insurance only covers the first two. My wife agrees with this approach in general, and when she makes dessert it\u2019s usually a low/zero-sugar affair. She grew up in Poland and has no childhood experiences related to Halloween proper.\n\nAfter we got home from trick-or-treating, my daughter was exhausted and had to be carried up to her bed by my wife after passing out on the couch. I went to the bathroom to freshen up and came out to my son wolfing down candy \u2013 there were 5 or so empty wrappers already on the floor. I don\u2019t know where he got the idea to eat them, as we have NEVER had candy at home \u2013 I guess he may have gotten some at school (he started 1st grade back in August). \n\nI scolded him on how unhealthy it is to pig out like that, took his bucket away from him, filtered out the non-candy, and dumped the sweets in the trash before telling him he needed to clean up the wrappers he left on the floor. He whined \u201cNO\u201d back and stomped off upstairs. I cleaned up the wrappers and threw out the candy from my daughter\u2019s bucket. She was surprised today that she had a lot fewer \u201ctoys\u201d than she did last night but has been way less sulky than my son. \n\nMy wife came downstairs after putting our daughter to bed and was wondering why our son was in such a bad mood, so I explained. She\u2019s not opposed to me drawing a hard line on sugar like that but said I probably should have told them ahead of time about what candy is and why we won\u2019t be holding on to it, instead of assuming both were oblivious. I\u2019m debating just not taking them trick-or-treating in future years, but they both seemed to really enjoy their costumes and their baskets weren\u2019t full of just candy. I\u2019m also debating mentioning this to my son\u2019s teacher and asking if she gives students in her classroom candy, but my wife thinks that\u2019s a bridge too far. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for throwing out my children\u2019s baskets (in front of one of them), and WIBTA if I loop my son\u2019s teacher into all of this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I let my kids have all the candy they want without any restrictions, they are allowed to have dessert WITH their dinner if we have dessert at all (not common in my culture), they can have ice cream or sweets before dinner. When i first started this, that sweet thing would be the first to be gobbled up and i would have to bite my tongue to not say anything about it. After some time (not long), as i observed, they would actually eat their food WITH the dessert item, or leave cake or pie or whatever leftover on their plates after taking only a bite or two, or let their ice cream melt as they ate their dinner.

The world we live in has abundant cheap and easy access to all the sugar you could ever possibly need or want, and your job as a parent is to manage that *appropriately*. And by appropriately, you need to have the discussion with your kids about why too much sugar isn't good and why you need to eat a healthy diet in moderation. What you are doing is is fine for now, when your kids are too young to make their own choices and buy their own food, but by banning and mystifying it you create this big THING and when they start to want to test boundaries, shoveling sugary rubbish down their throats is the first thing they'll do.\n\nBetter to have the occasional treat, reinforce why sugary food is a sometimes food, get them to help you in the supermarket by educating them on food labels but don't ban it.

Like donating it, I keep energy bars and water in my car when homeless people ask. I would probably just give out candy, for a couple of weeks instead.", "He could still do the switch witch. I don\u2019t tell my kids that Santa is real, but that he\u2019s instead from a fun story and we just PRETEND he\u2019s real. So we still do Santa pictures and presents from Santa, but my kids just think it\u2019s a fun game we\u2019re all in on. \n\nSo anyway, they don\u2019t have to actually think the witch is real. He could just say, \u201call right, as a trade for your candy, you each get to pick out a toy from the store.\u201d Hopefully after a big ass apology for being such a dick about Halloween and candy."]}
