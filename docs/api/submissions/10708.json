Of course, I\u2019m still going to see my daughter when I don\u2019t have work.\n\nMy ex is upset, as she somehow thought that we were going to become a family. I mistakenly hinted a few weeks ago I would be Interested in another baby in the near future if I got a better job? but intended for this to come across as a platonic gesture as I just want another sibling for my daughter.

Well tough shit, those are wants and wants come second to responsibility. \n\nWether you decide to get back together or not, you do in fact have a family, just a separated one. You owe it to your daughter, her mother and yourself to get your HS Diploma, get a good paying job and take your role as a father seriously.

Unfortunately until you have a ged your going to be stuck in a low paying job.\n\n3-find a vocational school near you. Find a trade. Tradesman make a lot of money. Trade school is relative cheap then most colleges and colleges are not for everyone. \n\n4- go to court and establish a custody plan and make sure paternity is established. \n\n5-Take a parenting class(this will be important later). Use every allowed minutes with your child. \n\nBut mainly quit sending the ex mixed signals. That\u2019s what makes you an ah. Quit using her for a place to stay.

Otherwise, grow up and accept that you're accountable for the kid you created, or fuck off.", "Don\u2019t act surprised when a judge slaps you upside the head with a big fat reality check.", "Dude, you\u2019re in for a real rude awakening when the courts inevitably get involved in this. You clearly have a lot of growing up to do. When you become a parent your child is your priority, you can\u2019t just drop them off because your living arrangements aren\u2019t good enough. Figure out your life.", "Your spare time is not her problem, either.", "It takes two to tango, and you don\u2019t have more of a right to spare time than she does. Man the fuck up and do better.", "YTA and a dick", "You do realize that having a baby is a lifetime (or at least 18 year - cause I bet this kid goes NC if you keep acting like this) commitment.", "No he might not but he can take from 08:00 to 22:00 \nOr stay over hers while she goes out. As long as the baby is laid out flat it can sleep just fine in a pram or a cot.\n\n The part that's pissing everyone off is his like I'll just take 2/3 hours on the weekend and then I'll go out shagging.", "So what is your suggestion then? He just see the kid a few hours every weekend while she does all the parenting and providing? Surely he also can\u2019t pay much child support if he\u2019s in shared housing so he just has no responsibility while she takes on all of it? He was equal part in making this baby.", "There isn\u2019t a problem wanting these things. The problem is the way you are coming across. It looks like you\u2019ve gave your baby mum mixed signals and it looks like you want to prioritise casual sex over your child. These things make you TA. It\u2019s human to want that lust, desire, feeling wanted. You just have to put it where it belongs in the list of things to do.", "There isn\u2019t a problem with those things, no. But you seem to believe that your *only* options are to lead on your child\u2019s mother, be an active father to your daughter, and spend the next 18 years without any intimacy OR to spend only a \u201cfew hours on the weekend\u201d with your daughter, leave your child\u2019s mother to raise her herself because \u201cshe can handle it\u201d, and have as much casual sexual as you want. \n\nYou spent 6 months playing house and then said *Ok, now that our daughter is sleeping through the night, here\u2019s a child support check \u2026 I\u2019ll see our daughter at some point, but I\u2019m going to be pretty busy going out and fucking people, so maybe I can hang out with her for a few hours on the weekend \u2026 if I have time. See ya!*\n\nSet boundaries and stick to them. Apologize for leading her on - FFS, you \u201chinted\u201d you wanted another child with her, so you **know** you led her to believe you saw a future with her. Figure out a parenting plan and custody schedule that allows you to remain actively involved in your daughter\u2019s life and puts HER needs above YOUR wants. \n\nAnd then, when you\u2019ve cleaned up your mess, figure out how to fit things like intimacy and dating into it. Because yes, if those things are important to you, you should be able to pursue them. **Just not at the expense of your daughter**.", "Cry me a river. Any woman who has sex with you better know where you stand on neglecting your child.", "Childcare and raising a baby just doesn\u2019t stop once the baby sleeps through the night.  You have a responsibility to be more actively involved in your child\u2019s life, than just a few hours on the weekend, when you\u2019re not hooking up with some random stranger. \n\n What about your ex and her needs?  She deserves to be able to go out and find a new partner and have intimacy in her life as well.  How is she going to do that when she has the baby 24/7 because you are so self-centered that you\u2019ll only take the baby for \u201ca few hours\u201d whenever you feel like it?  Good grief, YTA and a selfish one at that.", "Honestly, you shouldn't be having sex at all if you're just going to create broken families you can't afford", "She also went without sex. Why does this only matter for you?", "Absolutely no one deserves sex lol. It\u2019s not something you have an individual right to", "I do not think you understand:\n\n1-what parenthood means\n\n2-how to coparent\n\n3-women do not dig guys who abandon their children", "Ok so when does she get the time to go have casual sex? For the 4 hrs you\u2019ll take baby on the weekend when you\u2019re free? F off with that. You are the AH. You chose to be a part of this child\u2019s life. Like I said to my ex who is my child\u2019s father- you are all the way in or all the way out. There is no in between. Time to mature and sacrifice for your child.", "Your ex gf has those same social/romantic needs too, why should she be left with the baby basically 24/7 then? Why are your needs supposedly more important than hers?", "You can want those things. \n\nYou can not shirk your parental responsibilities to get those things. \n\nYou need a custody plan that you stick to. \n\nIf that means you only see your daughter on weekends well then you are going to have to figure out a different day to get laid.", "You purposely said misleading things until \u201cyou were ready to get your social life back\u201d YTA. Super selfish asshole. You don\u2019t deserve to be a parent you\u2019re not ready.", "Sex isn't a need - it's a want. You not having sex isn't going to result in immediate death. It's fine to want intimacy, but casual sex isn't intimacy. It's a bandaid for you wanting to feel desired because you're not doing anything to improve your living situation. If you want to be a dad, you need to step up and provide for your kid and be present, not a couch surfing Casanova.", "You don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d anything", "You chose to get your baby momma pregnant! Time to man the f up and take care of your responsibilities. Deal with the consequences of your f ups.", "Like that's understandable but your daughter is your PRIMARY priority, not your social life. Your ex needs breaks, AND your daughter needs her father. So, your weekends should be predominantly filled with HER, not your social life. \n\nYou are a parent now. Fit your social life during the week days after work for a 1-2 hours. If it is only casual sex, it doesn't require much effort and time.\n\nYTA. You're sending mixed signals and need to correct your priorities.", "Ugh this makes me so mad honestly. I had a shitty absent father like this and after having a kid of my own, I just cannot comprehend how a person wouldn\u2019t want to spend as much time as they could with their little one.\n\nAlso OP, you should look into the effects of having an absent father/absent parents. You\u2019re setting your girl up for issues later in life, and you\u2019re setting yourself up to be resented at some point because you didn\u2019t try hard enough", "He said he has a \"shared house\" aka roommates. He's been spending the night at his baby mamas at her request, not living there", "I'm like 500% there are drugs involved if he's working that many hours and is still completely destitute.", "Didn\u2019t say to stay with her either. He\u2019s the one who gave mixed signals. He also had a choice to use protection to prevent a child and didn\u2019t. Him wanting to get laid but also wanting to have another child with her is where he messed up.", "I want to be clear here that I think OP sucks. Just because many men get away with being shittier than him doesn\u2019t mean he gets a pass. He led the ex on with his talk of children and houses and while it\u2019s great he was there through the hardest time it does sound like now he wants to be a part-time parent when it\u2019s convenient and leave the brunt of the child rearing to her. My comment was ONLY meant to address the comment above suggesting they could switch custody regularly for a baby under 6 mos!", "She was on the pill and it didn\u2019t work. We were in a relationship at that time so no condoms", "Which it definitely sounds like she needs to", "I work my ass off during the week and the weekend are the only days I have to see my daughter and you call it convenient.  I\u2019d like to see her more but I can\u2019t. I have to work to Pay child support and to pay rent/bills/food. I don\u2019t have financial stability to get my own place and offer overnights.
