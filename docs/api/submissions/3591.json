I do think they will grow out of this behavior though.", "NTA.\n\nI relate to this very heavily because my younger brother does the same thing. \n\nEvery time I would get my haircut a certain way it wouldn\u2019t be too long before my brother started doing his hair in the exact same style. The worst example of this was most recently. Earlier this year I got an undercut because I have long hair and sometimes like to put it in a man bun but the hair that\u2019s lower on my head was too short to go into the man bun so it would hang out and look terrible. I let the top grow out and now my hair looks the same as it did before but I can put it in a man bun without the extra hair hanging out. When my brother saw my haircut he literally drove to Great Clips and got my exact haircut less than a week after I got my hair cut. \n\nOn top of the haircut thing, he copies my hobbies, dresses like me, and more. I played tennis in high school and my brother used to play soccer. He was really good too. This year, he quit soccer with zero explanation and started playing tennis. Last year, I got diagnosed with ADHD, and now this year my brother suddenly thinks he has ADHD too. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to gatekeep mental illness by any means but I would be genuinely floored if he actually did have ADHD. The year before my diagnosis I was in an AP Psychology class. In class we were learning about ADHD and because ADHD has a ton of misconceptions and misrepresentation in movies and other things I had never known what the true symptoms were before this class and after learning about it I realized that a scary amount of symptoms we learned about aligned with things I was experiencing daily. I didn\u2019t want to self-diagnose so I started reading more about ADHD to understand it more, and I eventually decided to get tested. When I got back my test results my doctor told me I have one of the worst cases of ADHD he\u2019d ever seen. To this day I still do a lot of reading about ADHD to help understand my brain better. All of this is to say, while I\u2019m not a psychiatrist by any means, I have a pretty solid understanding of what ADHD entails as well as how to recognize it in other people too. While I\u2019m very aware that ADHD has many different forms and symptoms and no two cases are the same, I still can say with about 99% certainty that he doesn\u2019t have ADHD. My brother and I are nothing alike in the way that we think, and nothing about the way he thinks, works, acts, talks, aligns with the symptoms of ADHD. Copying things like clothes and hobbies I can kind of understand but wanting to copy my mental illness is something I can\u2019t even begin to comprehend. \n\nLast year, I was home from college for a weekend and I played Break My Heart Again by Finneas on my family\u2019s piano ONE TIME because I had been learning the song earlier that week while I was at school and it\u2019s fun to play. I went back to college, came back home a week later, and he\u2019s playing the EXACT SONG (which, to clarify doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal but he hardly has any songs memorized on the piano but his turnaround on that one was literally a week)\n\nWhen I\u2019m on aux and he\u2019s riding in my car I literally don\u2019t play any music other than oldies that we both know, or current music if I know he already listens to the songs played on his own. He always asks me what song is playing and I used to tell him until he started listening to the same songs I like but overplaying them at my house to the point where the song is ruined and I start to hate it. This one I actually did confront him about but nothing changed. He knows I hate when he does this so I stopped telling him the names of songs and then he started trying to subtly Shazam the songs on Snapchat with his screen turned away and he\u2019d pretend to be doing something in his phone. So now I don\u2019t play him anything I like that he doesn\u2019t already know. \n\nI completely get what you\u2019re feeling and people love to say that \u201ciMiTaTiOn iS tHe HiGhEsT fOrM oF fLaTtErY\u201d which sucks because it\u2019s a super easy thing to say when you don\u2019t get it. I literally feel like he\u2019s trying to steal my life or at least my personality because over half of his personality traits are literally mine so I get your frustration. It sucks. \n\nI hate to gatekeep things but it\u2019s literally the only way i\u2019ve found that works to stop my brother from copying anything else he can from me.", "I will probably get downvoted on this, but I say NAH.\n\n\rOn the one hand I understand your need to have something \"that is only yours\". You want to assert your personality and your individuality and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\n\rOn the other hand, you are the older sister: it's normal for your sisters to look at you as a \"reference\" or a model. Or maybe, once they see your hobbies, they genuinely like them too.", "INFO: you'll have to elaborate a bit. Are the interests they're copying niche or generic general stuff? And how often do they do it now that they're above the age of 18? Because doing that when they were younger is pretty normal, younger siblings tend to want to be like their older one. But from personal experience, that kinda faded after the age of 13/14/15.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/9awcxi/my_younger_brother_copies_almost_everything_i_do/\n\nEventually they will grow out of it and become a little more distant. Foster a loving relationship with them while you can. Share you hobbies and tips and tricks as the older sibling. Embrace how cool you are for having younger people who want to be like you. You will miss it when they develop their own individual lives.\n\nKeep in mind they copy you because they look up to you and love you, whether they realize it or not. NAH", "NAH. \n1. You are confusing an activity you DO with identifying WHO you are. It's not. \n2. Mimicry is the highest form of flattery. Sure, it's annoying, but your sisters are doing it because they love and admire you. \n3. They are right, even if they are annoying. They are free to make their own choices, just as you are.", "No judgment, but as the oldest \u201crole model\u201d child I felt this. The annoyance for me was also because where was my role model? I didn\u2019t have an older-but-in-the-same-generation person to copy, so why couldn\u2019t they just explore themselves the way I did instead of using me? It seemed lazy or sometimes creepy from my point of view. Like, leave me the heck alone!!\n\nI even remember at least one AITA post where OP tricked the copier into cutting their hair a certain way when OP actually didn\u2019t do it, and getting a sense of catharsis from it, whether OP was TA or not.", "NTA, and an appropriate solution is to start picking up hobbies that you don\u2019t actually pick up. You just pretend to pick them up to watch them pick them up and laugh.", "I don't think you're an ahole. Your annoyance is understandable, but I would recommend not making a big deal about, eventually they'll discover more about themselves and develop their own interests.\n\nIf you're passionate about something, sharing those passions with others or helping them discover a passion for it should make you happy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It may help to think of it differently. Instead of copying you, think of it as that they look up to you and wish they were like you.

They won\u2019t like the same things as you forever because there will be a time where all of you will be living in different places so they will definitely have different hobbies than you. They are trying things out to see what they like.", "Nah- tbh lucky you, your sisters are looking up to as a idol. They want to be like you. As an older sister too, I want to share my interest with my sister's but they don't like the same things I do.", "NTA\n\nI agree that they may eventually grow out of it. But if it bothers you that much, stop telling them about new things you're trying. New patterns you learned to crochet, or new shows you started watching or new hobbies you picked up.", "NTA. My brother used to do the same and actually ruined a few hobbies for me this way. He'd copy everything, including music as well. The only difference was that he'd start obsessing over everything and make everything I did into his whole personality. He still does it to an extent, but since we're both adults now, don't live together anymore and see each other much less, it doesn't bother me as much. Our relationship is also pretty strained, in part because of his behavior.", "Aw I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.

I don\u2019t want to sound childish but I\u2019m afraid I do and honestly I don\u2019t mean it in a childish way. \n\nThank you so much for your reply tho! It honestly helped me :)", "Yeah! OP YOU make stuff look cool!", "Exactly, I was completely fine with them copying me when we were younger. That\u2019s normal. But it\u2019s the fact they\u2019re all above 18 and still copying me that kinda irks me sometimes I guess\n\nTo elaborate, they\u2019ll copy me in my passions which I love doing which are crocheting, henna applying and bullet journaling. They all started doing that too and it sort of became a competition of who does it better which I hate coz they turned my passion into a competition. \n\nThey also copy and new things I try and new likes I gain like making diy stickers, origami (I\u2019m a very artsy and creative person), calligraphy, etx", "Hope that helped understand a bit better.

Thank you so much. \n\nI genuinely wanted my feelings to just be validated if I was truly not being an asshole so thank you for that. \n\n I understand that I\u2019m allowed to be upset but I can\u2019t ask them to stop it either.", "My best advice:\n\nLive your authentic self, do whatever you find pleasure in, and know that those things are all a VALID part of YOUR identity.\n\nIf your sisters copy everything, at the end of the day they will be the one's with the identity issues and not you so long as you remember and know that you are not copying anything, you are living YOUR life.\n\nI hope they grow out of it. For the sake of your guys' relationship and also for the sake of their own developing identities. I don't want them to wake up one day and realize they might not even know who they actually are because they relied on you for their identity.\n\n(And I'm hoping they copy you genuinely because they realize they like whatever that thing or activity is. But regardless, it's important they explore and discover things for themself). All the best to all of you xxx", "But OP, you already have your own personality. From what I've read in this thread, you're a kind and thoughtful person who exercises her creativity in ways that she enjoys! \n\nYour hobbies don't define you, your sisters don't define you. Just do you!", "Aw tyyyy haha", "Ah ok. Yeah that's understandable it'd be a little irritating. \n\nHonestly you've just gotta learn to ignore the competition. If you live with them and are in close physical proximity then that makes things harder but don't make a big deal about it, you'll only come off as a bit nutty. Just focus on your business and pay them no mind. If they copy *everything* you do then perhaps they'll also become disinterested if you do.\n\nIf it's unique you want I'd personally recommend going out and travelling without them. But yeah just do your best to keep your head down and just work on your own shit instead of thinking about what they might be copying.", "How do they turn it into a competition? Is it between them?\n\nI do wanna say that your hobby is not who you are. They are important and a huge part of your life but they aren't you. I had a Co worker who loved robots. No big deal, robots are cool. Everyone who worked there liked robots to some degree but you couldn't mention like a movie with them without him jumping into say that robots are his thing. We got a new coworker who also liked robots. And it was insane how much the original guy had to have robots be his and his alone.\n\nYou don't seem like this guy and you're probably not wrong that your sister's are doing it a little to annoy you. And you can not tell them about what you're into as much because there is a line. You don't want to share everything. But it's also cool that they like something you like.", "It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated and annoyed, you obviously want to be your own individual person and when you find your own niche hobbies it makes sense to want to feel special for having them. Maybe if you spend more time away from your siblings and with people who do not share your interests, you will have a higher tolerance and appreciation for your siblings copying you.", "Lol. Glad it helped. I have 4 younger brothers. I'm well versed in annoying younger sibs.", "You're welcome,  I'm glad it helped.", "This was such a sweet comment, thank you \ud83e\udd79", "I think I really needed to hear the last line."]}
