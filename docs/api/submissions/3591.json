I started feeling like I didn\u2019t have my own identity, if that makes sense. I couldnt have my OWN personal likes and passions that were solely just my one.\n\nSo I told them to not copy EVERY new hobby I started or my passion especially since we\u2019re now no longer kids etc. and they were like \u201cyou have no right to stop us, if we like something you do, we can do it too.\u201d\n\nAnd I guess in a way that makes sense but I just wanted them to have certain boundaries when it came to copying what I like and I told them that.\n\nAITA?

I do think they will grow out of this behavior though.", "NTA.\n\nI relate to this very heavily because my younger brother does the same thing. \n\nEvery time I would get my haircut a certain way it wouldn\u2019t be too long before my brother started doing his hair in the exact same style. The worst example of this was most recently. Earlier this year I got an undercut because I have long hair and sometimes like to put it in a man bun but the hair that\u2019s lower on my head was too short to go into the man bun so it would hang out and look terrible. I let the top grow out and now my hair looks the same as it did before but I can put it in a man bun without the extra hair hanging out. When my brother saw my haircut he literally drove to Great Clips and got my exact haircut less than a week after I got my hair cut. \n\nOn top of the haircut thing, he copies my hobbies, dresses like me, and more. I played tennis in high school and my brother used to play soccer. He was really good too. This year, he quit soccer with zero explanation and started playing tennis. Last year, I got diagnosed with ADHD, and now this year my brother suddenly thinks he has ADHD too. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to gatekeep mental illness by any means but I would be genuinely floored if he actually did have ADHD. The year before my diagnosis I was in an AP Psychology class. In class we were learning about ADHD and because ADHD has a ton of misconceptions and misrepresentation in movies and other things I had never known what the true symptoms were before this class and after learning about it I realized that a scary amount of symptoms we learned about aligned with things I was experiencing daily. I didn\u2019t want to self-diagnose so I started reading more about ADHD to understand it more, and I eventually decided to get tested. When I got back my test results my doctor told me I have one of the worst cases of ADHD he\u2019d ever seen. To this day I still do a lot of reading about ADHD to help understand my brain better. All of this is to say, while I\u2019m not a psychiatrist by any means, I have a pretty solid understanding of what ADHD entails as well as how to recognize it in other people too. While I\u2019m very aware that ADHD has many different forms and symptoms and no two cases are the same, I still can say with about 99% certainty that he doesn\u2019t have ADHD. My brother and I are nothing alike in the way that we think, and nothing about the way he thinks, works, acts, talks, aligns with the symptoms of ADHD. Copying things like clothes and hobbies I can kind of understand but wanting to copy my mental illness is something I can\u2019t even begin to comprehend. \n\nLast year, I was home from college for a weekend and I played Break My Heart Again by Finneas on my family\u2019s piano ONE TIME because I had been learning the song earlier that week while I was at school and it\u2019s fun to play. I went back to college, came back home a week later, and he\u2019s playing the EXACT SONG (which, to clarify doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal but he hardly has any songs memorized on the piano but his turnaround on that one was literally a week)\n\nWhen I\u2019m on aux and he\u2019s riding in my car I literally don\u2019t play any music other than oldies that we both know, or current music if I know he already listens to the songs played on his own. He always asks me what song is playing and I used to tell him until he started listening to the same songs I like but overplaying them at my house to the point where the song is ruined and I start to hate it. This one I actually did confront him about but nothing changed. He knows I hate when he does this so I stopped telling him the names of songs and then he started trying to subtly Shazam the songs on Snapchat with his screen turned away and he\u2019d pretend to be doing something in his phone. So now I don\u2019t play him anything I like that he doesn\u2019t already know. \n\nI completely get what you\u2019re feeling and people love to say that \u201ciMiTaTiOn iS tHe HiGhEsT fOrM oF fLaTtErY\u201d which sucks because it\u2019s a super easy thing to say when you don\u2019t get it. I literally feel like he\u2019s trying to steal my life or at least my personality because over half of his personality traits are literally mine so I get your frustration. It sucks. \n\nI hate to gatekeep things but it\u2019s literally the only way i\u2019ve found that works to stop my brother from copying anything else he can from me.", "I will probably get downvoted on this, but I say NAH.\n\n\rOn the one hand I understand your need to have something \"that is only yours\". You want to assert your personality and your individuality and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\n\rOn the other hand, you are the older sister: it's normal for your sisters to look at you as a \"reference\" or a model. Or maybe, once they see your hobbies, they genuinely like them too.", "INFO: you'll have to elaborate a bit. Are the interests they're copying niche or generic general stuff? And how often do they do it now that they're above the age of 18? Because doing that when they were younger is pretty normal, younger siblings tend to want to be like their older one.

I didn\u2019t have an older-but-in-the-same-generation person to copy, so why couldn\u2019t they just explore themselves the way I did instead of using me? It seemed lazy or sometimes creepy from my point of view.

Just focus on your business and pay them no mind. If they copy *everything* you do then perhaps they'll also become disinterested if you do.\n\nIf it's unique you want I'd personally recommend going out and travelling without them.

We got a new coworker who also liked robots. And it was insane how much the original guy had to have robots be his and his alone.\n\nYou don't seem like this guy and you're probably not wrong that your sister's are doing it a little to annoy you.

But it's also cool that they like something you like.", "It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated and annoyed, you obviously want to be your own individual person and when you find your own niche hobbies it makes sense to want to feel special for having them.

Many many symptoms point towards it but I\u2019m not diagnosed officially. Hopefully soon. It explains the many many interests lol", "If you read the manhwa Cheese in the Trap there\u2019s a girl who copies the female protagonist and it was so frustrating to read.", "Well I said a possible reason that they aren't as open for New experiences and you are kind of the tastetester.\n\nAnd a passion to yourself sounds pretty much like you want to identify yourself through it.\n\nSeeing it competetive definetly is not productive in these cases,did they try to one up you everytime or were they discussing how they saw aspects different then you that you felt threatened in your hobby?", "Thank you so much! Honestly this was an amazing reply and had so many things I really needed to hear. Thank you for validating my feelings, I appreciate it \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "I really like your comment. Take my poor man's award \ud83c\udfc5", "Omg sameee :(( I\u2019m sad but also glad that you get it. Even if it\u2019s things they both can\u2019t do, one sister is able to do it anyway. It\u2019s one or the other.", "No, they involuntarily and in an unsaid way make it a competition like \u201cwho does it better? Oh look I\u2019m better than you at this new things you\u2019re started haha!\u201d", "Haha loll", "Thank you so much for the advice and for validating my feelings. I honestly appreciate your reply :)", "Damn that sucks. The way you explain it, it sounds like they feel they are in competition with you. NTA.", "Nope, they try to one up me me everytime with everything and they don\u2019t even admit I started it first. They go like \u201coh I already wanted to do this and I already was gonna do this\u201d and then they go and do it better and I hate that now a like of mine is a competition to prove they\u2019re better :/", "That's AH behavior on their part.", "Thanks :( and yeah a competition is exactly how it feels", "In that case I wouldn't really comment on your hobbys,maybe they saw you trying something new and try to one up you,just pay it no mind it doesn't decrease your personal gain from it and they might stop it as they lack the reaction from you.\n\nIt's could also be a slightly screwed way to bond with you,I don't know,what I know though is if you try to prohibit it they will do it even more and more obnoxiously.\n\nIf you ask why teens are often A's without meaning to be one or even realising that", "Yeah, I\u2019ve realized it gets me nowhere to get annoyed at them and tell them to stop copying everything of mine. They don\u2019t do it immediately after I started it so they claim they\u2019re not copying me and it was THEIR interest from the start too. So I just let it be coz what else can I do :/", "You should tell them you\u2019re going to start a new hobby but make sure it requires a lot of equipment and it\u2019s very expensive. But then don\u2019t actually buy anything yourself and see if they take the bait", "You\u2019re NTA\u2026 here\u2019s why. As the oldest of 3\u2026 I dealt with this once upon a time (context I\u2019m 38M now) and at first like you flattered and then annoyed. My parents didn\u2019t help\u2026 and I felt like I was not allowed to be me or have anything that was mine. It led to feeling like crap and not caring for myself\u2026 I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy for this. Anyway I\u2019m rambling and I\u2019m sorry\u2026 but please know you are not the AH at all\u2026 and I get fully where you\u2019re coming from. Copying a few things sure cool\u2026 everything?!!? No not cool. It is better now\u2026 but that time was hard", "Info diet time! NTA op", "Say you have a new hobby, something you know they hate, tell them you are having an amazing time and absolutely love jt.\n\nTell them stuff that you know they absolutely hate.\n\nPick clothes off websites and mention you got this and that, but don't buy it.\n\nChange your appearance and get a wig, do the absolutely opposite.\n\nNTA\n\nMary did this and her sister cut her hair, Mary went to a restaurant to meet her mum and sister.\n\nThe sister had cut her hair in a pixie cut, Mary walked in with her long hair.\n\nSister went ape but Mary just looked and said what you going on about, my friend and I were going out on night out and thought this would be fun.\n\nYNTA\n\nOh by the way sister eventually stopped copying after that.", "NTA  They sound exhausting.\n\nTime to get some new hobbies that either they won't want to do or you can somehow use to your benefit.\n\nStart studying for the LSAT and announce you want to get into a T14 law school and work for biglaw.  \n\nStart gardening and then let them put in the work to have a better garden.  \n\nStart volunteering someplace.  When they volunteer more and better than you then a charity/good cause will win.\n\nUse their competitiveness against them.", "Tell them you are into stamp collecting and pondering get a  tattoo of  stamp on your lower back and see what happens.", "NAH. \n\nI did the same thing to my older sister and ulna younger sister did the same thing to me. It\u2019s definitely frustrating but if you don\u2019t make a big deal they will get bored and find their own hobbies.", "This may also become a case of the sisters getting exposed to an activity that they may not have really paid attention to until it was in their face via OP. They may have previously paid certain activities dust until they saw it in action and then found that they liked it.", "I mean, I'm petty so I would mess with them.  There was a post here a while ago where I think it was a co-worker copied everything that OP did, fashion-wise.  So, OP posted a bunch of pictures showing herself with a short cut and raving about, so co-worker got one too.  OP then revealed it was a wig and she still had long hair, and co-worker was *pissed*.  It was glorious, and IIRC it solved the problem.  What's the grossest hobby you could convince them you had taken up?", "Lol! I was thinking the exact same thing. Handcrafted fecal jewelry, anyone?", " I guess.\n\nI\u2019ll check out the post you linked!", "NTA", "A suggestion:\n\nTake up some sort of an academic or training course that will benefit all of you.  You don't say whether you are in college or other training, but all three of you would benefit in years to come if you have training that provides good jobs.\n\nThere are so many more jobs available nowadays for women than when I was young.  One young woman I know is a professional engineer, and another is training to be an electrician.  \n\nSeize your opportunities, OP.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But start pretending to take up off-the-wall hobbies.  Get interested in video poker.  Say that you want to start raising llamas.  Buy a wig and pretend like you dyed your hair green.  See how far you can push them.", "NTA I had shared interests with sis growing up and yeah, there could be some one upmanship going on, but we had different interests too, that the other never wanted to be part of. \n\nSome overlap is good. All is bad.", "NTA- if you can stomach it get into something that will gross them out like taxidermy \ud83d\ude05", "NTA, one of my friends do this, I understand how you feel.", "put on a bald cap and tell them you shaved your head.", "YTA their interests in your interests should not diminish your interest or you're not really interested in that thing, you're just there for the imagine. Which is pathetic.", "I was thinking wear a bald cap or Photoshop for social media a picture of you being bald. Say you're trying out a new look. Don't visit for a couple weeks, then show back up with your regular hair. After all of course they can have any hair style they like. And why would you actually shave your head as a tryout? Then if you didn't like it you'd be stuck with it; and you didn't like it so of course you didn't shave your head after the tryout. And they shouldn't be mad at you if they do decide to shave their heads. It's not like you suggested that they shave their heads.", "This really depends on your schedule and how much money you're willing to put into a new hobby. Is it possible to get into a hobby that either has an expensive starting cost, requires a lot of time commitment, or is physically demanding, or is something they fear? \n\nFor instance, an expensive one to start would be something like rock climbing or hockey. Both of those have expensive equipment you need to do, and hockey also has expensive club costs. \n\nTime commitment: this one's harder cause a boggy can take as much or as little time as you're willing to put into it. I would say a table top rpg like d&d or pathfinder. While it would only happen once or twice a week, usually groups meet up on Friday night or weekends and sessions usually last a couple of hours.\n\nPhysically demanding: kickboxing, regular boxing, muay Thai, bjj, mma. All of these are martial arts. All of them are physically demanding, and depending on the gym you do to, most of them will involve sparring against someone.\n\nSomething they fear: if you know they fear spiders you can get a pet tarantula. Or if that's too much of a commitment, you could start being really into fake spider decorations.", "Like others have said, you definitely do have your own personality.  You're a trend setter and leader in your family... your sisters are just followers.  They seem unable to come up with anything of their own, so they just follow you...", "you're kind of evil. I like you."]}
