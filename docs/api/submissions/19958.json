I've been witness to too many friendships or roommate situations going sour over who pays for what streaming and who uses it the most and the constant headache that goes along with those spats.\n\nIMO it's kind of a petty reaction since you're paying for and using the services regardless but there's also nothing inherently wrong with it. You could even phrase it something like, \"After you told us about the Netflix change, we thought it was a good idea to be separately responsible for our entertainment accounts, so we'll be changing our passwords soon.\" The keyword there is \"we,\" however you proceed, you and your husband need to be a united front and in agreement on the action.

Thumbs up.", "Talk to your in-laws. Find out what their objection is. This new licensing is a huge change, and a 130% price jump is a lot. At 8/month, that's an extra $96/year and even well-off people are noticing the pinch of inflation. It is possible that their objection isn't to the idea of you using their service, it's the idea of having to pay extra to Netflix for you to do so. It can feel like Netflix has changed the terms and conditions unfairly (for all that Netflix has been telegraphing that they're going to do this, extensively, for years). Let them have their complaint. Agree with them, it does feel unfair. They're right to feel that this is unfair.\n\nThey are probably unaware that you feel like they're saying they don't value what you kindly gift them. They're probably not aware that you hear this as them saying \"we refuse to pay a tiny bit extra so you can keep sharing because we're selfish\". They probably haven't even thought about the comparative costs to you versus them, because that's not necessarily what this is.\n\nYou're tied to these people through your husband. If you cut them off your subscriptions in retaliation to them airing their frustration with corporate America with you, they won't see it as funny, they'll see it as being mean without any provocation and YWBTA. Even when you tell them that you did it because you felt hurt and unappreciated, the damage will have already have been done. Why not skip forward to the part where you tell you husband and his family that that is how you're reacting, and see whether a compromise could be worked out?\n\nIf it comes down to it, wouldn't the next dozen years of holiday and birthday celebrations with in-laws you get along with, be worth volunteering to pay the extra $76/year? Take it out of their holiday or birthday presents or whatever petty thing makes you smile. Can you imagine a situation where your future self sends you back a message and says \"yes, you were right to start this stupid fight with your in-laws?\"\n\nYou have to pick your battles.

And if you\u2019re gonna be using those accounts anyway, do you really need to be upset they don\u2019t want Netflix? \n\nLastly, do you all go over there? Sometimes it\u2019s just convenient to leave yourselves logged in at their place for the sake of any grandkids etc. Your hard line idea would be awkward when kids ask for a show or whatever while at their grandparents.\n\nPick your battles, $8 sounds like a petty amount to take your stand on - while I fully get you in principle.", "NTA.

I'll still pw share as long as the companies let me, but I won't pay extra for them anymore. If I did that, then like everything else once times get lean for them, I'm stuck paying it for who knows how long. You don't want to know what I pay for phones every month.
