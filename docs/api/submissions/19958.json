It is possible that their objection isn't to the idea of you using their service, it's the idea of having to pay extra to Netflix for you to do so. It can feel like Netflix has changed the terms and conditions unfairly (for all that Netflix has been telegraphing that they're going to do this, extensively, for years).

You don't sound like working class \n\nAgain, I'm sure they'll leave **a little something** for your family when they **depart**. This will far more than compensate for this tiny sacrifice. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.", "NTA", "NTA. If you hear any objections, you could simply say: \u201cAhh, I understood e we\u2019re not sharing streaming services anymore. Let me know if you\u2019d like to change that.\u201d \n\nThey absolutely have a right to refuse their service to you, but it should also be assumed that the same goes for them.", "NAH. He's not required to pay for Netflix, and you're not required to share your other passwords with him. On the other hand, you can't help how other people act, but you can control how you react to other people. If it were me, I wouldn't bother starting a pissing contest with people I have to spend the next eighty years hanging out with. It's the 21st century. You're probably going to live to be a hundred. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You better start picking your battles. Save your strength for the big fights.", "NTA. I\u2019m petty. I wouldn\u2019t even give a head up. If they asked I would be like oh we had to lower our streaming to our household only so we could get our own Netflix since we got kicked off of yours.", "Nta. When you put it in another context is there really a question about it?  Say your family and fil car pooled, with three adults you all drive every third day.  Yes your family drives/pay double the costs, but it even puts in the inconvenience factor.   Prices inflate for fuel so your fil says he is no longer a driver, but still expects to be picked up the same?   Would you kick him out the car or still pick him up. \n\nSo just shoot your fil a simple text stating since the arrangements have changed on their end to online streaming, so have yours and you have reduced the amount of watchers to better save money.  Then advise the passwords had to be updated with the changes.", "Nta\n\nAvoid drama by telling them no worries you understand about the cost  and you're cancelling some of the services and password sharing with another  couple or something to explain why they'll be kicked. You're no longer main account holder etc.", "YWNBTJ (you would not be the jerk) Apparently, the agreement was that your FIL would pay for Netflix and you and your husband would pay for Peacock, Disney, Paramount, and Discovery and the passwords for all streaming services would be shared between you.  Your FIL is changing the agreement by not allowing you to use \"his\" Netflix, therefore you are under no obligation to share the passwords for the other streaming services with him. In fact, now that Netflix is cracking down on sharing the passwords/streaming, you probably should not be sharing the passwords for any of the streaming services because sharing those passwords is illegal, according to the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. While most services have yet to crack down on violators, they are considering stronger enforcement action as it is costing them millions/billions. Penalties currently are a fine and/or jail time (up to 12 months!)", "I am in a similar boat and was starting to reconsider a similar decision. bro in law doesn't want to pay for one streaming service he pays for cause someone else shared their account while continuing to use the ones we pay for.", "netflix just added their new \"home network\" policy. more likely the parents are still paying for themselves", "It might not be 8 dollars anymore. They are doing a thing where you have to pay for every new tv/ip address using the account.", "The heart of this makes me want to say; they paid for every bit of entertainment he had growing up. What\u2019s the difference if you share the password for something you already pay for. Seems a bit petty to me. Whatever will they do without one extra streaming app.", "Yeah I doubt this started out as a quid pro quo situation. It seems petty of OP to boot FIL even though it doesn't make a difference to their bills whether he's using their accounts or not. It sounds like OP has slowly been letting the resentment build over paying more than their \"fair share\" for streaming, and should've asked long ago for FIL to pay half the cost.", "FIL has been providing himself with Netflix all along, and was able to share his password so OP could use his account. Now Netflix isn't allowing password sharing anymore, so for OP to use FIL's account, FIL would need to pay an extra $7.99/month to add a second household to his account.", "I have worked since I was 17 and had a steady job out of college. Yes, I am currently not working but in a full time accelerated masters program.", "Evens out the inconvenience factor, autocorrect changed a word on me", "Did you mean to leave this on a different post?", "Nope", "Where did you get the impression that OP\u2019s FIL is a drunk, and what would his drunkenness have to do with paying for Netflix?", "I mean my old grandpa loves disney+ because of Star Wars, Marvel, and the Discovery Channel. My grandma loves movies like Zootopia. Disney+ is the only streaming service they have because everything they love is on there", "I know plenty of \"old guys\" that enjoy NatGeo which is part of Disney+.", "They could just be lying tbh and that's what's getting people to ACTUALLY sign up.", "Oh well hot damn, now on a second closer look i guess I did!", "> I was also in a very different place financially when I started helping them out.\n\nBetter or worse than now?", "NTA,  if they don't want to pay for you why should you continue to pay for them?", "\"Given the changing terms of service, we agree with you that it makes the most sense for everyone to cover our own streaming services separately from now on. We will be changing our passwords and cease sharing from this point forward as well.\n\nSee you at Christmas!\"\n\nNTA", "I would almost find it strange if you didn't. \n\nLike, the arrangment was \"lets save some cash by sharing streaming apps\", and FIL decided to stop sharing apps because it was more expensive. Thats fine, his call, but its also him choosing to cancel that arrangement.", "You would BTA if you just do it without warning. Like others said maybe they just dont use all the other services? There might be zero malice or pettiness behind this (and maybe there is). What if you just sat down with them and all had a convo? Point out what you spend monthly and share with them and that the additional 7.99 doesnt seem like a lot for their contribution. Maybe they are just pissed (as i am) that Netflix is doing this but aren\u2019t really seeing the bigger picture. So many variables here that might cause unnecessary drama and strain important relationships.  If they say they use all the things you provide, then point out the disparities in what you each pay. And if they still just refuse, then change all the passwords unapologetically!", "I would absolutely say kick them off and I would also say don\u2019t tell them about it, just remove them. It\u2019s not even an extra 10 dollars", "They've implemented a pile of different price tiers this year. And they seem to be testing a bunch of different countries with different options.\n\niirc in Canada we've got like 5 options now. 5.99 with commercials. 9.99 for 1 screen, 1 household, no password sharing, and no HD/4k (this is the one I have for now). Then there something like 15or16.99 with 2 screens at a time, no password sharing but with HD/4k. Another more expensive again, but there is more screens and more sharing and the HD/4k. I guess thats only 4. \n\nBut! starting at the 16.99 option, you can pay something like 5 to add sharing to other location. And then keep adding $5 for more locations.\n\nI got dizzy trying to get thru it all when they changed it lol.\n\nRight now they are trying all sorts of options like those in different regions.", "NTA OP.  My husband and I have deleted most of our streaming services and are now down to just 2: Prime Video with a Paramount + extension; and Peacock.  Netflix was just getting too expensive, and we weren\u2019t really watching Hulu anymore.", "Nta.  Change the passwords.  And delete their profiles.", "So lie? Right. The next time they\u2019re over and everyone decides to watch a movie, oops! -there are those \u201ccancelled\u201d subscriptions."]}
