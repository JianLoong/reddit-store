Like, \"ah, well, it doesn't actually cost us anything to keep them on here, even though they just kicked us off, maybe we are assholes hmmmm\"\n\nNo, it's fine, kick em off.

That's the adult way to handle it. I'm not a password or profile sharer, it's just not my thing, mainly to avoid things like this. I've been witness to too many friendships or roommate situations going sour over who pays for what streaming and who uses it the most and the constant headache that goes along with those spats.\n\nIMO it's kind of a petty reaction since you're paying for and using the services regardless but there's also nothing inherently wrong with it. You could even phrase it something like, \"After you told us about the Netflix change, we thought it was a good idea to be separately responsible for our entertainment accounts, so we'll be changing our passwords soon.\" The keyword there is \"we,\" however you proceed, you and your husband need to be a united front and in agreement on the action. If you're not on the same page, it's most likely that your husband will just log them back in or share the new passwords.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust frame it as \"dad told us he no longer wanted us to share streaming services\".

Go to their house, connect to their wifi, login to Netflix, go home and enjoy your month of free Netflix. Rinse and repeat.", "Yes you will be the YTA. You should have a dialogue with them first. Real child move to just cut them off without notice. Tell them you pay X$/month and that they can either pay the extra share fee or you will cut them off from the other services. I on the other hand share all my accounts with friends and family without batting an eye, i think one should do it since you basically pay for 4-5 persons (and so far only Netflix have enforced this sharing rule).
