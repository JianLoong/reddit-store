It is possible that their objection isn't to the idea of you using their service, it's the idea of having to pay extra to Netflix for you to do so. It can feel like Netflix has changed the terms and conditions unfairly (for all that Netflix has been telegraphing that they're going to do this, extensively, for years). Let them have their complaint. Agree with them, it does feel unfair. They're right to feel that this is unfair.\n\nThey are probably unaware that you feel like they're saying they don't value what you kindly gift them.

This sub selectively chooses when to count score for arbitrary reasons.\n\nFurthermore, people are saying the FIL is an AH because they are assuming that he is going to have a problem with being kicked out.", "I gave the reason in one of my previous comments and in this one too. People are calling FIL because he told OP and her husband that he won\u2019t be paying the extra 8$ for them for Netflix but he did not say anything about the streaming services that they share with him. That usually means that he wants to continue using them but does not want OP to use his Netflix account. \n\nIf someone says to me that I can\u2019t use their shared account anymore but does not say anything about the account I shared with them, I will assume that he/she will want to continue using it and I will consider them an AH. Same with FIL", "No one is making an assumption that he \"will\" make a \"fuss\" about it. The thing is that he did not say anything about the accounts he is using that are not his. He is going to kick them off from his account but made no comment about OP's accounts. Whether he will have a problem or not is another thing that OP will find out after their talk. At present, his words mean that he will still use theirs."]}
