I asked her why because I really didn\u2019t get it. We conversed a little and though she showed signs that she was feeling a little uncomfortable that I was asking her this, I kept the conversation going because I wanted to explain why I was asking her this question instead of saying, sure! I\u2019m not super well off but I make good money and am financially stable.. so spending a few hundred or even a few grand for a designer handbag or a counterfeit for much less was nbd. But I really wanted to rather get her something that has much more intrinsic value, so I wanted to explain my rationale. She ended up getting quite offended that I asked her that question and kept the conversation going. She then told me that this was the worst birthday of her life.\n\nShe\u2019s usually not the type to care that much about showing status (she hasn\u2019t even bought new clothing aside from a few tshirts since maybe a year or two ago).\nShe\u2019s also usually the very meticulous type to always evaluate what she wants to spend her money on. She does her research thoroughly and decides if she wants something or not and buys a cheaper alternative if she thinks there is a lot of overhead on certain popular consumer goods.\nI just wanted to understand why she suddenly felt the need to show status (but not spend the 2k or however much it is for a gucci or dior bag - and hence the ask for a counterfeit) but we now both feel super hurt on her birthday.. AITA?\n\nEDIT: A lot of thoughts usually race in my head. I think the whole counterfeit part triggered most of it, and led to just a lot of questions in my head. But in retrospect I\u2019ve totally fucked up as a partner to just get her what she wants for her birthday. After-all, I did truly want to get something she wanted and she finally answered. The numerous questions that came up in my head dont really matter for shit. Having questions are fine\u2026 but I need to frame them better casually maybe at a later time. (I should probably tame my adhd better as well.)

If she wants the bag get her th bag, who cares why she wants it. It only matters that she wants it. You really are making this a miserable experience for her and in future (if there is one) she might feel weird and not be able to tell you what she actually wants because she's afraid of being interrogated.\n\nI used to ask for practical things for birthdays and Christmas' but my husband said to me one year I should pick something I want, not something I need because we can get the practical anytime.", "YTA. It\u2019s not about the handbag. She showed signs of being uncomfortable and you kept pushing her. I personally don\u2019t buy genuine designer because 1. it\u2019s usually poorly made and overpriced and 2. when I inevitably scuff, stain, or otherwise damage the item, I don\u2019t feel bad.", "Info: how many times did she tell you to drop the conversation? How many questions did you ask?\n\nAsking once and getting an evasive answer would land you an N T A, but you kept at it after she was clear she didn't want to talk about it would change that answer. Also, was she offended or just annoyed? Offended would make me think something weird is going on, but annoyed would make sense after being badgered.\n\nAlso, as the recipient, SHE gets to decide what the 'better' gift is. I can see how that would piss her off.", "'What do you want for your birthday?'\n\n'\\[Thing\\]'\n\n'Ew, gross, why?'\n\n'Never mind, forget it.'\n\n'but y tho?

Nobody likes the Spanish Inquisition.", "YTA. She's allowed to like the style of the bag, and she's not wasting money by getting the super expensive version (granted, depending on the brand, the expensive one may be better made). So your wife wants to branch out style-wise, she wants a cute bag, she'll find it useful -- so what? Did she say any of that -- that she just liked it? Did you interrogate her over her wanting something \"different\"? It was a little extreme to say \"worst birthday ever\", but something has to be missing here.\n\nNew job or friend she may be trying to impress? Maybe she \\*is\\* just trying to play with style. Maybe she's getting older and has decided she wants a nice bag and wants to try out a cheaper version before spending the money on the real thing. I dunno.\n\nEdited: I see some of your comments, and I'm leaning towards her wanting a nice bag. It's not a shocking to want as you get older. So she doesn't know exactly what she wants and maybe she's asking for permission for a nice bag. You know, you could help her look into it.", "YTA.  You didn\u2019t just ask out of curiosity.  You required her to justify the gift.  \n\nSo what if you want her to have something with more \u201cintrinsic value.\u201d  It\u2019s her birthday, and what *she* wants is what matters.  \n\nGood luck getting her to open up to you about anything else.  She showed you that she *does* sometimes desire material things, for whatever reason, and you made her feel uncomfortable about it.", "YTA. Gifts should be about what the receiver wants, not what you (the giver) perceives a gift should be.", "YTA. People are allowed to want things without having a good reason. You asked what she wanted, then required her to justify that want. I'm guessing it will be some time before your wife asks you for anything but the most basic things. Perhaps that's what you want. And that's a sad thing if true. \n\nYou hurt your wife's feelings, and likely made her feel like an idiot for asking. You owe her an apology.", "YTA.\n\nYou made her uncomfortable with being judge and jury over what she wanted for her birthday. \n\nWhy do you feel hurt? She did nothing wrong. You're making her birthday about your feelings over a bag, you don't need to understand or question why. You can justify it all you like but you ruined her birthday when you could have just let it go.\n\nGood luck in her being open with you in the future about gifts. She'll save her self the inquisition and she won't want to risk another day being ruined.", "Man you are absolutely terrible.\n\nYou asked her what she wants, she told you and you keep questioning her.\n\nYou did ruin her birthday for her. If she wants it, then buy it. She did not ask for the original version. If it\u2019s Chanel or Prada it\u2019s more than 5k or 6k so get her the cheap fake version. \n\nBut seriously. You ruined it for her. She\u2019s allowed to have nice fake stuff. there is no need a reason why. She told you what she wants, just buy it.", "So, when someone asks you for a gift on their birthday, you don't make them have to explain and defend their wants. That's what a schoolteacher or boss does, not your partner.\n\nSo yeah, kind of a fuckup on your side. Do something spontaneous and nice, and apologise.\n\nYTA", "YTA but I can empathize what made you ask because I too have adhd and it's difficult for me also to let stuff go if I dont understand the rationale behind something without feeling like my brain is itching. I get it that you were totally ok to buy this but that you were curious as to the thought process behind her decision. I get fixated like that too and I used to be too impatient to hold off on the questioning. So like you, I would also give into my impulses and go on questioning the other person until they got sick of it. In my mind it would just be a matter of curiosity and logic, but I realised later that it came off to *them* as if I was being disapproving or judging and in general way too intense. \n\nWhat I recommend you should do in a similar situation is\n1) agree immediately to buy her the requested gift (especially as it's her birthday and there don't seem to be any financial or other restrictions against buying it)\n2) don't ask questions at that moment (this is where you need to work on impulse control and developing patience)\n3) later once you give the gift to her and she is all happy then you ask her \"btw I'm just asking out of curiosity,  is there a reason you picked out this particular gift?\"\n\nSometimes you just have to make peace with the fact that a lot of neurotypical people will answer with \"no particular reason....I just wanted it\" and you have to train yourself to just be satisfied with that as it can come off a bit rude to hound a person for their reasons and it feels counter intuitive to you because if the roles were reversed, you would actually take great pleasure in explaining in detail the thought process behind your decision.

Why does she have to explain why? That's so weird and a really annoying question to have to answer.", "YTA\n\nYou asked what she wanted and she told you. Why does it matter what her reason is?\n\nBuy the damn bag and move on.", "YTA. \n\nYou asked, she told you, you passed judgement and now you are trying to school her. \n\nShe is your wife, not your child. It's fair that you ask but it's unfair for you to judge and then try to teach her a life lesson. \n\nYou even posted that she puts a lot of thought into her purchases and doesn't shop for clothing often. If this is the case, why didn't you just trust her instead of creating an awkward situation. \n\nYou sir, need to apologize and make this right.", "YTA and why do people think it is OK to act like this?", "YTA\u2026..did u ever think that maybe she just liked the style of whatever bag she wanted? It\u2019s pretty obvious she doesn\u2019t care about displaying wealth/status, since she literally asked for a CONTERFEIT and not a legit one. Especially when u said yourself spending the money to get a real one is no big deal. As well as from ur own explanation of how she usually approaches buying anything.  Also\u2026..why tf does it matter why she wanted it, when she\u2019s asking for it for her birthday present?", "I think, as you said... she might have carefully researched what she wanted and found it at the price point that would do the job for her.\n\nDid you consider perhaps, it wasnt the name on the bag but the actual style of the bag?  \n\nShe just wanted a purse for her birthday and your inquisition made it feel like you were doubting her ability to choose something.... for. her. birthday.\n\n\nYTA", "NTA and these takes are wild. I feel like every time I open this sub it\u2019s filled with the wildest takes. How dare you ask your wife *checks notes* questions?!\n\nDon\u2019t listen to these lunatics", "NTA!  \n\n\nGive her something she likes but that you can stand behind. Giving a gift is not only about the person receiving the gift, but it always has a personal connection to the person giving the gift. If the intersection of the things she likes and you can stand behind as a gift is the empty set, then the birthday is rather the smaller problem, in my opinion.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone else has explained WHY. Now lemme explain how you're gonna fix this mess if you really are committed to doing so.\n\nFirst you are going to go online and find some stores that sell bags. You are going to note down their addresses.\n\nTHEN you are going to book either a lunch or a dinner at a nice restaurant.\n\nIf you book a lunch, you take her to that lunch, you pay for it and you tell her over that nice meal that you are sorry about being such an idiot over the bag thing, and that after you're done eating, you are taking her shopping so she can choose a bag she loves.\n\nIf you book a dinner, you do the apology and the bag shopping first and then the dinner.\n\nGift giving should ALWAYS be about the person receiving the gift. She told you EXPLICITLY what she wanted, do you KNOW how easy that makes shopping for her? SO many people whine about how the people in their lives are hard to shop for whereas your wife actually told you what she wanted.\n\nTry not to get hung up on 'why', especially if the biggest question is 'will this make someone happy?'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not whatever alternate bag you think is best.", "I don\u2019t one why some people do this, but it is absolutely exhausting to be hounded to explain your  reasoning, especially on things like this that really aren\u2019t that deep or can\u2019t be immediately articulated to the asker\u2019s satisfaction. It very much ends up being \u201cJustify your choice to my satisfaction or it is not valid.\u201d", "OH, look at me, I am Mr. ADHD, I can say shit when I want and then hide behind my disorder.\n\nAs I always believe, gift is not about what you think is worth or \u2018logical\u2019, it\u2019s about the person receiving it. Second, you don\u2019t need to understand the logic when giving someone gift. Gift is something what people want, no what people need. This is gift not options where you need to understand intrinsic value, lol. If at all, here\u2019s the thing for you, try to find the intrinsic value of \u2018gift\u2019 rather than bag.\n\nYour conversation was more about explaining how that is illogical and proving yourself right rather than about her. Based on your responses, I suggest you should get checked for ASD as well. Honestly, not a sarcasm.\n\nAnd yes, I understand ADHD and ASD personally. Unfortunately, I am guilty of same things in the past. My advice, don\u2019t try to find logic in everything.", "You weren't trying to learn something. You were trying to undermine her reasoning and convince her to see your side. You're a flaming asshole.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand why everyone is being so harsh.\nAuDHD here and totally understand what you were trying to ask and just get some clarity. If it was an unusual request for a gift it\u2019s not insulting or controlling to just ask why or what type so that you can get the right kind of bag, especially since she only gave you vague information of \u2018a fake designer bag\u2019 without any specific info. \n\nIf someone asked me that I would also check that they hadn\u2019t maybe considered a middle ground of a cool bag that is a mid range price so it\u2019s not super expensive but not a cheap knockoff that will fall apart.\n\nIt\u2019s called having a conversation and it\u2019s about the intention behind the words and not just automatically assuming the worst of your partner, especially when they are neurodivergent. Misunderstandings happen all the time between neurotypical and neurodivergent people and this sounds like one of them.\n\nAlso OP it\u2019s possible that if you were diagnosed before 2013 with ADHD that you wouldn\u2019t  get an autism diagnosis because they generally did not do dual diagnosis back then (and if ADHD was present they would dx for that if meds were being considered). Aspergers is no longer a diagnosed term (it\u2019s level 1 or low support needs autism) and if you are having regular difficulties with communication or social interactions you may want to look at some of the testing for it if you\u2019re interested.

Idk maybe for a birthday gift for your spouse you are not supposed to ask why and just get them what they want \n\nYes. This. No frowny face. And what do 'represent'? The more you write, the more of an AH you appear to be.", "You can ask her in a nice way, like when she started liking that designer. Or oh I didn\u2019t know you liked those handbags. What you did was interrogate her as though she was hiding state secrets. You were making her feel guilty and being judgemental about it. It\u2019s her birthday. Let her indulge for goodness sakes.", "I get it, but just because she wants a nice bag, doesn't mean it's going to be all logo covered or showy. She's allowed to explore her style, and it doesn't mean she's radically changing or anything. You could say you'd be happy to get her one, and to tell her to shop around and come to you with what she wants. Or offer to go exploring together, whether in a range of shops or online. \n\nIn my case, many times I just buy bags at thrift store / vintage stores, they're often not very expensive but quirky and fun. Sometimes I've been able to find designer things for very cheap. But that's not to say that someday I might want to get a new bag, a nice bag, in the exact style that I want instead of trying the odds at the shops I tend to. Personally sometimes I like certain designer things because they're less obnoxiously frou frou than the things I see in stores. But that's just me. \n\nJust saying, support her in this. This is one branching out of her style. It's another if she suddenly or slowly comes to want gaudy designer multi-thousand dollar everything.", "Apologize and talk it out. Perhaps you could offer to take her out soon and do whatever she likes, no matter what it is. If she agrees, do what she wants with a smile and without complaint or question. \n\nAnd buy her a bag if she still wants one. Maybe not counterfeit, those aren't always great quality, but there are shops out there that sell secondhand designer bags. Often those are not as expensive but are just as well made.", "Holy added information to make a silly point \ud83e\udd23", "[Embrace Autism tests](https://embrace-autism.com/autism-tests/)\n\nMentioned it below but here is a link to online tests you may want to check out.\n\n It\u2019s not hiding behind ADHD as an excuse if you are explaining why communication can be difficult with a neurotypical partner. It\u2019s providing context.", "Don\u2019t have aspergers but have been diagnosed with ADHD. I usually have difficulty following the flow of conversations at times. I don\u2019t mean to hide behind my disorder. I really would like to make my partner happy, but I end up saying a lot of shit that doesn\u2019t matter at the end of the day. Thanks for the personal anecdote. I should really just let love and trust take over and not try to find logic in things all the time.", "Yeah I changed from n a h after reading comments.", "It was just a mixed bag of: 1. Why not a genuine one? 2. If she wants one to show someone then what if they find out its fake? 3. Why not a leather brand bag thats equivalent price with better materials and build quality? 4. She\u2019s mentioned a lot of things she sort of wants lately.. why this one that she never talked about?\nBut yeah i done goofed. Honestly she wasn\u2019t asking for too much and I should have just gotten her what she wanted.", "She wants the counterfeit one tho! Just get her one.", "What's your view then, I haven't seen you make any judgement?", "I actually sort of get what you are saying! It\u2019s not using ADHD as an excuse but I also struggle at times especially when I\u2019m run down/stressed to follow conversations when I have a million things going on in my head. I also when I\u2019m nervous or overwhelmed tend to ramble on or over explain. It\u2019s not that I use it as an excuse, I acknowledge it, try to change it and I don\u2019t blame any one else for it but you still have ADHD so you aren\u2019t going to think the same way or not struggle at times with it. However yes, listen to her when she says that\u2019s what she wants or be upfront and say you are happy to buy the expensive version and accept it if she doesn\u2019t want that.", "Why does any of that matter? She's an adult. She's allowed to want what she wants.", "Earlier you said \u201cI only asked 1 question\u201d but here you clearly dumped at least 3 continuous questions, then every time she told you what she wanted you counter her with \u201cwell why not something else?\u201d \n\nAnd you saw she was uncomfortable but you still kept pressing. YTA for misrepresenting yourself to make yourself look better. YTA for thinking you know better then her about bags. YTA for trying to change her mind to pick something you think makes more sense, when it\u2019s all just bags. Bag is a bag. She had an idea of what nag she wants and you tried to convince her if YOUR REASONING why you said what you said. Why not just go with what she said? Why do a series of questions that are phrased in a way to imply that another way is better. \n\nShe decided on a cheaper option - why not get a genuine one??? (So you complain that designer is a waste of money, but then you get on her for choosing the cheaper option ?) this questioning doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nShe wants a bag - oh do you want to show it off to people?? You insinuate that she wants to show off designer bag and that\u2019s the only reason to get one? This was a back handed question that probably hurt her feelings \n\nThird question - why don\u2019t you pick something else, you know, this is better and won\u2019t fall apart. It\u2019s not designer so your not showing off. You already told me what you want but I know better. \n\nThat\u2019s how you come across. That\u2019s why it\u2019s rude and you probably upset her. What\u2019s the point of asking her what she wants, then you come up with reasons and question her as to why it\u2019s not good enough, pick something else when it\u2019s not a good answer you like.", "What the fuck are you talking about. It\u2019s just a bag. Do you pick apart everything like this?", "YTA. \n\nAgreed that ADHD does make it hard to judge situations but the excuse of ADHD doesn\u2019t really apply here seeing as he actively noted he could tell she was uncomfortable but kept pushing anyway because he wanted to explain about his own feelings. I also have ADHD and it\u2019s always only in hindsight that I\u2019m talking too much and wish I\u2019d said less. In the moment, if I realize I\u2019m making someone uncomfortable or embarrassing myself, I am able to pull it back. Maybe not 100% but that\u2019s usually because I\u2019m in a social situation like a party and feel so overwhelmed that I go the opposite direction and go mute and awkward. It\u2019s been described as \u201cturning my lights off\u201d because even my facial expressions go muted. \n\nI\u2019m curious as to why she prefers counterfeit because I think we all are a bit silly to go for the full price option if the counterfeit is just as good, so I\u2019d love to here her thoughts because tbh I don\u2019t have enough money for either counterfeit or real. So I love hearing about people\u2019s choices from a fellow fashionista perspective. But this wasn\u2019t the time or the place, especially when she was visibly uncomfortable. \n\nYou should\u2019ve made one attempt to offer her full price \u201cok cool, just tell me what bag you want! Budget is $2k so if it comes designer under that price, I can buy it non-counterfeit if you prefer. You just tell me what you want most because it\u2019s your day and I want you to be happy!\u201d And then sit back and let her direct it.", "I really dislike that giving an explanation is always seen as an excuse. It can be \"I know I made a mistake, here is the context, which I give to make clear I understand what it is I need to work on\". If someone doesn't know the explanation for their behaviour they are less likely to be able to improve that behaviour. And if someone has ADHD it is relevant context for how they interact with the world, even if it doesn't excuse bad actions."]}
