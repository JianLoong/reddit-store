Where i work im not allowed to ask questions why for stuff like that so I agreed when they were done talking to my boss.

I\u2019m afraid they likely were looking for something/someone to complain about, maybe trying to suggest it was because she was feeding, in order to get something for free.", "NTA Did your boss expected you to force your service on them? They asked you to leave. He should have enough experience to know that they just complain to get free stuff. As your boss he should have your back and not cut you off with a raised hand what is so disrespectful. \n\nI personally would look for another place to work for. If he treat you this in such a clear case, he will treat you shitty otherwise.", "You're NTA. Document exactly what happened on your write up. If you have a Human Resource department, contact them. The customers were complete A-Hs because they complained about the situation they created. Your boss was an even bigger A-H for not listening and backing you up.", "NTA. Sounds like a strategy to get food comped. Learn from your experience though, and if it happens again, maybe politely ask how long she'd like privacy, or maybe say you could come back in 10 min? That way there's no issue with \"walking off\".", "NTA, she told you to leave and you respected that. They were being petty because you probably left \u201cfor too long\u201d but I think 15-20 minutes is a very reasonable time to breastfeed. You did nothing wrong. Your manager/boss has horrible communication skills for a higher up. Absolutely horrible to run a restaurant like this.", "nta\n\nthey were trying it \n\ndont worry", "NTA", "NTA, but you should look for another job.

In the future, you know what to look for. You will see that, and more, in the future in that job. Next time just verbalize their request out loud, as in \"ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR PRIVACY FOR 10-15 MINUTES\"? Lol....They complain anyway though...", "NTA but everyone else is. What kind of job doesn\u2019t allow you to ask questions? They need to go under ASAP", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing in giving them the space they requests.  They did this on purpose in order to complain to get something for free.  It's probably something that they do regularly thinking it's a good scam.  In reality it just hurts people who are trying to do their job.\n\nBased on your managers reaction they clearly don't care about you or they would have believed you and not written you up.  Personally I would tell them where to shove their job if they treat their employees like that and go to work somewhere else.", "Is that what they call that? Either way, I'm with you, op got scammed. NTA", "I own a restaurant and I\u2019ve never heard that term. This happens more often than not hate people.", "Yup, immediately thought this too.\n\nNTA", "This! Probably not their first rodeo either. But its a catch 22 Because if they pushed against their narrative, the restaurant can be shamed in social media as well and there's no recording of the exchange either. Smooth modus operandi I must say.", "Perhaps she expected OP to stand there and not leave but with her eyes closed\u2026", "Tbf, breast feeding with people around vs a person trying to take your order are different, but I agree with the 'looking for something/someone to complain about'.\n\nBig gestures can save you, check the tapes", "Was OP to watch them to see if she'd finished breastfeeding while simultaneously giving them privacy? How does that even work?", "It's actually a boxing term, but the shoe fits.", "It was a boxing strategy used by Muhammad Ali. I just felt this situation felt like being baiting into something to turn the tables on the server.", "Thank for the fun fact. The losers have way to many strategies.", "A good response is \u201csure.  Just set your closed menus on the side of the table to let me know when you are ready to order\u201d.  If they really wanted privacy they\u2019d agree.  If it\u2019s a scam they will find a way to complain no matter what.", "NTA\nShe literally asked you to leave", "I watch these restaurant shorts and one of them had the waiters wearing body cams so when people tried to lie they could play the footage back. I know it was a joke but I would support it. NTA. Definitely a scam for free food.", "If I got written up for something that is blatantly untrue I would quit. Also as a server you are in pretty high demand at least in all the areas around me. Everyone seems to be in demand, so pick a place get a new job and leave them high and dry. They can find a different scapegoat.", "NTA What were you supposed to do? First the mom asked you to walk away for some privacy which you did and then they complained about it. They can't have it both ways. As for your manager, he should have backed you up. I would have quit on the spot and walked away.", "NTA - this was a scam. They know wait staff is treated like shit by management and took advantage of it by asking for one thing and then lying and claiming something else happened.", "NTA\n\n You don't get to both ask for privacy and then complain you got some privacy, and if I had a guest treat me like I'd actually deny them service.\n\nYour Boss taking a guest at their word without even attempting to hear your side before issuing disciplinary actions also lead me to suggest applying for another position as your boss doesn't trust you, and it likely won't improve", "NTA\n\nKinda rude of them to ask for that and then get mad when you offered privacy. A decent amount of time, too, cause no baby I knew would finish in 5 minutes either\n\nBoss, though, and the parents are A H", "You did the right thing, nta. But the fact that you aren't allowed to speak up for yourself or ask questions at work...your boss is an AH. Look for a new job.", "NTA it seriously pisses me off when people do that and even more when the manager doesn't back you.  \nOP you should go to your manager and bring this incident back up and ask how you can better handle it next time.  Ask if you get asked this again if you should just ignore the customer and stay and see what you're manager says then", "Absolutely!", "This is what I would have done.  Say you aren't comfortable.  What is it with people who mess around with the people handling their food? I worked in fast food as a teenager and it was honestly the older folks and the supervisors who were more likely to do something to your food.  Kids don't know better. Op should be looking for another job if this is the type of boss she has.  It isn't even a nice time taking kids to a restaurant anyway.", "Right. I'm 100% down with feeding a baby whenever and wherever it's hungry. ...but in doing so in a public place, you accept that the public place will continue functioning around you while you nurse. Who takes up a server's table and then tells them they need privacy!?! That alone is ridiculous (unless it's a quick \"I need a min to get the baby latched\" kind of thing).", "breastfeeding can take anywhere from a couple minutes to over half an hour depending on the milk letdown and how hungry the kid is. so it\u2019s very possible she could have been breastfeeding for 16 minutes. i think it would\u2019ve been acceptable if they asked for a minute of privacy so the mom could get situated and then have orders taken.", "This exactly, they have no proof unfortunately that the family did ask for privacy and thus risk stuff like that being spread about the restaurant. They definitely know this and use it to their advantage.", "The Rope a Dope Ali Shuffle \ud83d\ude02", "Ali would lean against the ropes and try to put his arms up protectively, like he was almost beaten and needed a solid punch to lay him out, to bait the opponent into hitting him ineffectually and wearing themselves out. Then he'd pop up from his rest and lay into them.\n\nOutside of boxing, it basically means you act passive / defensive to catch someone off guard, then go on the attack."]}
