In the future, you know what to look for. You will see that, and more, in the future in that job.

Lol....They complain anyway though...", "NTA but everyone else is. What kind of job doesn\u2019t allow you to ask questions? They need to go under ASAP", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing in giving them the space they requests.  They did this on purpose in order to complain to get something for free.  It's probably something that they do regularly thinking it's a good scam.  In reality it just hurts people who are trying to do their job.\n\nBased on your managers reaction they clearly don't care about you or they would have believed you and not written you up.  Personally I would tell them where to shove their job if they treat their employees like that and go to work somewhere else.", "Is that what they call that? Either way, I'm with you, op got scammed.

Probably not their first rodeo either. But its a catch 22 Because if they pushed against their narrative, the restaurant can be shamed in social media as well and there's no recording of the exchange either.

I know it was a joke but I would support it. NTA. Definitely a scam for free food.", "If I got written up for something that is blatantly untrue I would quit. Also as a server you are in pretty high demand at least in all the areas around me. Everyone seems to be in demand, so pick a place get a new job and leave them high and dry. They can find a different scapegoat.", "NTA What were you supposed to do? First the mom asked you to walk away for some privacy which you did and then they complained about it. They can't have it both ways. As for your manager, he should have backed you up. I would have quit on the spot and walked away.", "NTA - this was a scam. They know wait staff is treated like shit by management and took advantage of it by asking for one thing and then lying and claiming something else happened.", "NTA\n\n You don't get to both ask for privacy and then complain you got some privacy, and if I had a guest treat me like I'd actually deny them service.\n\nYour Boss taking a guest at their word without even attempting to hear your side before issuing disciplinary actions also lead me to suggest applying for another position as your boss doesn't trust you, and it likely won't improve", "NTA\n\nKinda rude of them to ask for that and then get mad when you offered privacy. A decent amount of time, too, cause no baby I knew would finish in 5 minutes either\n\nBoss, though, and the parents are A H", "You did the right thing, nta. But the fact that you aren't allowed to speak up for yourself or ask questions at work...your boss is an AH. Look for a new job.", "NTA it seriously pisses me off when people do that and even more when the manager doesn't back you.  \nOP you should go to your manager and bring this incident back up and ask how you can better handle it next time.  Ask if you get asked this again if you should just ignore the customer and stay and see what you're manager says then", "Absolutely!", "This is what I would have done.  Say you aren't comfortable.  What is it with people who mess around with the people handling their food? I worked in fast food as a teenager and it was honestly the older folks and the supervisors who were more likely to do something to your food.  Kids don't know better. Op should be looking for another job if this is the type of boss she has.  It isn't even a nice time taking kids to a restaurant anyway.", "Right. I'm 100% down with feeding a baby whenever and wherever it's hungry. ...but in doing so in a public place, you accept that the public place will continue functioning around you while you nurse. Who takes up a server's table and then tells them they need privacy!?! That alone is ridiculous (unless it's a quick \"I need a min to get the baby latched\" kind of thing).", "breastfeeding can take anywhere from a couple minutes to over half an hour depending on the milk letdown and how hungry the kid is. so it\u2019s very possible she could have been breastfeeding for 16 minutes. i think it would\u2019ve been acceptable if they asked for a minute of privacy so the mom could get situated and then have orders taken.", "This exactly, they have no proof unfortunately that the family did ask for privacy and thus risk stuff like that being spread about the restaurant. They definitely know this and use it to their advantage.", "The Rope a Dope Ali Shuffle \ud83d\ude02", "Ali would lean against the ropes and try to put his arms up protectively, like he was almost beaten and needed a solid punch to lay him out, to bait the opponent into hitting him ineffectually and wearing themselves out.

If you're going to get written up for refusal of service then it's best to make it worth it.", "I can almost guarantee you can find a job easier than your boss can find a new server.

They can't have it both ways", "NTA", "New mom here of a 5 month old and still drives me crazy how some people are so entitled just because they have children.", "Its illegal to do that. And you have a bad boss. My anger issues couldn't never \ud83d\udc80", "Info: did you attempt to check on them at any point?  Did they ask for a minute to get baby latched?  I know when I breastfeed in public sometimes I\u2019ll ask for a quick minute to get situated but never to leave the entire time I feed\u2026 Sounds like you may have misunderstood the request.", "Soft YTA.  You're young so I assume you're also inexperienced.  You left a table for almost 20 mins without service!!  Did you not even glance over or check in during that time?", "NTA and he\u2019ll no tell your parents what happened. Have them help you report the boss to his supervisor. You\u2019re a minor his ass will be in so much trouble for essentially bullying you.", "NTA - its a scam to get free food. 15 years in the kitchen, I've heard this one before. Tell your boss he got tricked.", "NTA, that's for sure.\n\nBut it is possible that there was some kind of missunderstanding? People here seem to assume the worst of everyone, but let's be real... I worked as a waitress too when I was at school and (especially if you work with tourists) there are often issues with language barriers. And if I had the feeling that my waiter is judgy about my breastfeeding I would be snippy too.\n\nWhat shocks me more is that you are not allowed to ask why somebody complains about you AND that your boss didn't back you up. That's the red flags you should be looking out for because you probably won't see the family again, but you will have to work with your boss on a daily basis.", "INFO: Could you not see the table from anywhere else where you were in the restaurant? Was she still breastfeeding when they complained to your boss? Or had she stopped and you had never gone back?", "NTA, but your boss is.\n\n As a former restaurant manager I can see both sides but it's not write up worthy. After 10m I would have walked by and asked the man (without looking at at the lady) if they still needed privacy or were ready. If they still needed it then I'd say \"please flag me down when you're ready\" (which honestly you can say that to begin with so it's their responsibility to let you know they are ready since you aren't a mind reader). \n\nAlternatively, (to me) if she needed to feed she should have done so in the car before coming in so she didn't waste your time. (I say this because it's obvious that she needed to as it was the first thing she did and not something that happened mid or end meal)\n\nI'm a blunt person, and I honestly would have told them that once they asked you for privacy is their job to inform you when they are ready, not yours to try to guess when they are ready.\n\nETA:: You (but mostly your boss) need to not get in the mindset that the customer is always right. They are not. And it's okay to firmly but politely (this is key) stand your ground. Let them go to corpo and let corpo soothe their ego but don't give in on your end. Don't say you're sorry, say \"it's unfortunate you feel that way\". Corpo might reach out for details if they complain but as long as you are calm and polite and can recite how you were calm and polite they'll usually drop it.", "If i were you, I\u2019d look for another job.

They are scam artists who set this up so they could get a discount or comped meal. Your manager is an A H though for falling for this trick and writing you up.", "NTA. And I\u2019m willing to bet they've pulled this before in an attempt to get free meals.", "As a parent I wouldn't go to a busy restaurant when I know it's close to feeding time, grab a table, and occupy that space for 15 minutes with no movement of service. They're basically stifling the waitress from making money by hogging space and not being served.", "I agree it sounds like they were trying to get something for nothing.  They are assholes and so is your manager.  And so is the God-damned kid.", "NTA.   It's a scam and it works because people like your manager allow it to work. It's a shame you had to suffer because of it.", "Cheap losers trying to get free food.  I hope you spit in their food", "NTA!!! How can you expect privacy when you are breastfeeding in public?!? And, then, to have the audacity to complain to your manager? This makes my hair hurt.", "I would have been so mad if my manager said that to me and probably would have quit on the spot. How rude. Obviously, NTA.", "NTA- They were probably looking for a free meal.  You got in trouble for giving them the privacy and respect they asked for. While in public there is no privacy by the way. I would have told the manager to assign someone else to the table.", "Nta but your boss sure is", "Your boss and them are assholes.

They\u2019re angling for free crap by complaining.\n\nIt\u2019s super annoying when shit like this happens, just know it\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s a game they\u2019re playing. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve learned? If someone asks you for anything out of the ordinary, tell someone else. It doesn\u2019t have to be a whole thing, just next run through the kitchen be like \u201c5 just asked for a few minutes to breast feed, cute baby!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a loose form of CYA, meaning you alwyas have someone to corroborate. Idk if your kitchen is like mine, but we were always shooting off our mouths so this was just kind of part of it.\n\nNot your fault though. Customers like this suck, because to protect yourself you have to distrust potentially genuine customers and that\u2019s a balance you\u2019ll have to find.", "Yeah exactly what I was thinking. They asked for something weird and complicated, then when they got it they complained about something completely different, just to get a free meal. I bet they do it all the time.", "That\u2019s extra scummy that they\u2019re getting a teenage girl reamed out because they\u2019re taking advantage. Just absolute bottom of the barrel scum.", "> They rope-a-doped you\n\nI can\u2019t believe a fully grown woman with 3 kids is seriously doing that", "OP walked away for 15min though. I doubt they meant walk away and never come back\u2026 More can you please give us a couple minutes? OP needed to keep some sort of eye on the table to know when Mom was done feeding and she could return. Sounds like that didn\u2019t happen.", "So would you have written her up? If so, why? Would you have made her go back to serve them? If so, why? Seems she has a pretty bad supervisor", " If he treat you this in such a clear case, he will treat you shitty otherwise.", "Of course, but they'll justify it saying they're entitled to it. Hell they'll probably create a Go Fund Me for their hurt feelings.", "Yup and I bet they can't afford them. What better way to feed 5 than to cry about service.", "Really? Because I read that story as two entitled parents trying to game the system getting something for nothing, and who cares whose job they endanger in the process.", "I dunno what exactly happened, but couldn't they wave OP over once they were ready to order? And breastfeeding can take a while, right? So maybe OP just wasn't sure how long it'd take and didn't want to seem too obtrusive by hovering around them.", "They obviously have working mouths and can communicate, they can\u2019t just wave her down when they\u2019re done?", "i never worked in any kind of food place. and sometimes you got to remind staf that you are waiting (places just can get busy) but to go to someones boss and complain especialy when you as customer denied service first thats just low.", "I don\u2019t even wanna have kids cuz I\u2019ll never be able to afford them, then I see people pulling stuff like this and it really annoys me. Like, if you\u2019re gonna be a parent, you have to be good enough and mature enough\n\nAnd she doesn\u2019t just have 1 kid.
