I'm 100% down with feeding a baby whenever and wherever it's hungry. ...but in doing so in a public place, you accept that the public place will continue functioning around you while you nurse.

Tell your boss he got tricked.", "NTA, that's for sure.\n\nBut it is possible that there was some kind of missunderstanding? People here seem to assume the worst of everyone, but let's be real... I worked as a waitress too when I was at school and (especially if you work with tourists) there are often issues with language barriers. And if I had the feeling that my waiter is judgy about my breastfeeding I would be snippy too.\n\nWhat shocks me more is that you are not allowed to ask why somebody complains about you AND that your boss didn't back you up. That's the red flags you should be looking out for because you probably won't see the family again, but you will have to work with your boss on a daily basis.", "INFO: Could you not see the table from anywhere else where you were in the restaurant? Was she still breastfeeding when they complained to your boss? Or had she stopped and you had never gone back?", "NTA, but your boss is.\n\n As a former restaurant manager I can see both sides but it's not write up worthy. After 10m I would have walked by and asked the man (without looking at at the lady) if they still needed privacy or were ready. If they still needed it then I'd say \"please flag me down when you're ready\" (which honestly you can say that to begin with so it's their responsibility to let you know they are ready since you aren't a mind reader). \n\nAlternatively, (to me) if she needed to feed she should have done so in the car before coming in so she didn't waste your time. (I say this because it's obvious that she needed to as it was the first thing she did and not something that happened mid or end meal)\n\nI'm a blunt person, and I honestly would have told them that once they asked you for privacy is their job to inform you when they are ready, not yours to try to guess when they are ready.\n\nETA:: You (but mostly your boss) need to not get in the mindset that the customer is always right. They are not. And it's okay to firmly but politely (this is key) stand your ground. Let them go to corpo and let corpo soothe their ego but don't give in on your end. Don't say you're sorry, say \"it's unfortunate you feel that way\". Corpo might reach out for details if they complain but as long as you are calm and polite and can recite how you were calm and polite they'll usually drop it.", "If i were you, I\u2019d look for another job.

Because I read that story as two entitled parents trying to game the system getting something for nothing, and who cares whose job they endanger in the process.", "I dunno what exactly happened, but couldn't they wave OP over once they were ready to order?
