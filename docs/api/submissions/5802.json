They love spending time together and have similar interests.\n\nI should mention that both Erin and Ariel have been diagnosed with autism.\n\nErin's symptoms are a lot milder than Ariel's, though. Ariel is developmentally delayed and goes to a special needs school. She really struggles to make friends and is non-verbal around new people. Ariel is very prone to meltdowns and can't tolerate a lot of everyday things.\n\nErin on the other hand, you wouldn't be able to tell is autistic unless you were very clued up or she told you. Her symptoms are there but they are subtle. Erin struggled more when she was younger but she has been taught coping mechanisms.\n\nOnto the story. For the past couple of years, Ariel has been obsessed with collecting baby dolls. All she wanted for Christmases and birthdays was baby dolls.\n\nAriel treats the baby dolls like they're actual babies. She'll spend hours feeding them all, changing their diapers, holding them, cuddling them, etc. They all have full names and Ariel gets upset if she can't get home to them on time.\n\nOf course there's nothing wrong with her doing that, it makes her happy and no harm done.\n\nYesterday, my brother invited us round, and Erin and Ariel went upstairs to Ariel's room to talk and play.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, Ariel runs down the stairs crying and runs towards my brother and hugs him. The conversation went like this:\n\nBrother: Ariel what's wrong, why are you crying?\n\nAriel: Dad, do my baby dolls have feelings?\n\nBrother: Why are you asking me that sweetie?\n\nAriel: Erin said my baby dolls don't have feelings and that they aren't real people. Do they have feelings?\n\nMy brother went silent for a few seconds and gave me a weird look. Erin soon after came downstairs, and she told Ariel that she's sorry for upsetting her. Ariel told her it was okay.\n\nMy brother told us we should leave so we went. On the drive home I asked Erin what happened.\n\nShe explained that Ariel was showing her some baby dolls she got for Christmas, and Erin made a comment that one of the baby dolls looked prettier than another. Ariel got really upset and said that Erin was going to hurt their feelings and told her she needs to apologize, and Erin told her they don't have feelings and they're just objects. \n\nShe said she thought Ariel knew they weren't real and didn't expect her to get upset.\n\nI got an angry text off my brother saying that Erin needs to be punished for what she said because it was inappropriate and made Ariel inconsolably upset.\n\nI've refused to punish Erin and my brother is now not talking to me and said that Erin is a bully and that I'm not the one who has to deal with Ariel being upset.", "created_utc": 1672173360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwpezv/aita_for_not_punishing_my_daughter_for_telling/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Erin has the right to her factual opinion; dolls do not have feelings. Ariel also has the right to her emotional opinion that dolls do have feelings. Honestly many therapist use dolls to simulate a  person and use human based emotions for that doll. So there maybe some logic behind Ariel\u2019s opinion. \n\nHowever, your brother accusing your daughter of being a bully is unfounded and uncalled for. As you said, Erin apologized to Ariel after she walked downstairs to see her crying. So I see no need for her to apologize a second time. Your brother needs to step back with his emotions and allow his child to self regulate. He himself needs to learn to self regulate his emotional state instead of mirroring it onto his child.", "NTA.  Punishing her would be ridiculous.  She apologized for upsetting Ariel and that should be enough.  It's a bit weird that your brother thinks that Erin should be punished, rather than teaching/helping Ariel cope.  (Although I admit that I have very little personal experience with autism).  I understand that Ariel may not comprehend it, but it just seems weird that your brother would insist Erin be punished when he knows that she is also autistic.", "Erin already apologized to Ariel and Ariel accepted her apology. What does your brother expect to accomplish by punishing Erin after the fact? The girls have already sorted it out. Your brother on the other hand seems unhinged. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA- your daughter did nothing wrong.  Yes, her cousin was upset in the moment, but she also accepted the apology, and TBH it's better to come from home than at school, which it will no matter it being a special needs school.\n\nYour brother's infantalizing of his daughter is concerning, though.  This is unfortunately very common in parents of autistic children, moreso in those who have more severe symptoms like your niece's.  This may seem like a small, non-issue, but I can assure you it's present in other aspects of their lives, and is going to lead to Ariel being unable to do anything for herself and/or being so naive of the outside world that she is taken advantage of in more ways than one.  She's on the cusp of, or even entered into puberty.  What if a boy at school or an extra curricular convinced her she'd never be a true \"mother\" to her dolls unless she did the things that make babies?\n\nIt can be very easy to allow your autistic child to live in their fantasy/happy place.  But it's *never* in their best interests socially or safety.  I would sit your brother down and have a serious talk about this concern.  He can confer with her doctors and therapist/s to figure out how much she can handle learning/accepting about at certain times/life stages.  He won't be around to protect her forever.  She needs to learn about how to handle the real world to the best of her ability while he is still able to help her best.", "NTA.\n\nPunishing her for this would be not only absurd, but also cause further damage to her.\n\nShe only told the truth and didn\u2019t mean to cause AND harm \u2014 so punishment would be ridiculous and harmful towards her.", "NTA. Erin was not being a bully. She didn't realize that Ariel thought the dolls were real and the conversation played out that way. She DID apologize for upsetting her, too. Your brother is just upset because Ariel is inconsolable right now and he doesn't know how to make her feel better. I wouldn't know either.", "NTA: your brother is the asshole for telling you to punish your daughter. I felt, reading that your daughter apologized for hurting Ariel\u2019s feelings, that the situation was dealt with a good as it possibly could have. I couldn\u2019t imagine a better outcome between two autistic children. Ariel even said it was ok. You\u2019re brother is on a crusade and he needs to chill, big time.", "Nta. In your story Erin apologized to Ariel when she came down and Ariel accepted the apology. There's no need to keep piling on punishment. Everyone makes mistakes and says hurtful things, it sounds like Erin realized her mistake and apologized. That's it.", "NTA - It would be absurd to punish her for this.", "My son is mildly autistic, so more like \"Erin\".  He would feel terrible if he made someone cry, no punishment would be necessary, and it would be a good teaching moment in \" knowing your audience\".  I'll go NTA.", "NTA\n\nI have three kids, one (10) definitely is on the spectrum, his little sister (5) is not diagnosed yet but displays a lot of the same behaviors and symptoms as her brother (and frankly myself, when I was their age) \n\nThings like this are always a bit difficult to navigate, roleplay with toys is totally normal behavior and even beneficial for later in life, to learn empathy and other things, but at the end of the day we don't do our children any favors by letting them believe that their toys are \"real\" in this sense. Your brother I'm sure is doing his best, but he's mistaken if he thinks that you are in the wrong here.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter handled the situation very maturely, apologizing for upsetting her cousin and being able to move on, but your bother on the other hand is not being mature about this at all. No children were bullied, but now he is essentially bullying you into punishing an innocent child and trying to force you into dealing with his mistakes as a parent to boot. \n\nNo op, you're NTA here. Your brother is not doing his daughter any favors by parenting this way at all.", "NTA - She apologized for upsetting her cousin straight out the gate. Think your brother is getting a little hot over something he shouldn't and over stepping at the same time.", "NTA This is akin to one kid telling another there\u2019s no Santa Claus, you don\u2019t punish a kid for telling the truth.  Erin apologized for getting her upset, Ariel accepted the apology, your brother is totally wrong to demand more.", "NTA\nYour brother can't put his daughter's emotional well-being on the shoulders of a 10 yo.", "NTA. Your daughter did nothing wrong and should not be punished. I know you have to make allowances for people with disabilities, but you cannot mold the world to fit their needs completely, and your daughter should not be expected to.", "NTA- Uhm Erin is right it\u2019s just a doll not an actual baby no need to apologize for stating facts if Ariel can\u2019t handle it that\u2019s her problem", "NTA Your daughter was not being a bully. Your brother could tell his daughter \"some people believe dolls have feelings, some people don't believe it.\" Don't punish your daughter. She didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA -- from what it sounds like, would it be fair to say that Ariel is more along the lines of being in kindergarten? \n\nYour daughter had good intentions and I can only imagine how challenging that would be as a kid herself to understand.", "NTA\n\nShe feels bad about it already\nEven if you thought she was in the wrong she has been puniy enough.", "NTA.\n\nErin apologized and Ariel forgave her.   \nHaving a special needs kid can be uniquely painful sometimes, and I really do get that, but your brother needs to take a breath and realize that Erin wasn't being cruel.", "NTA. This is just weird. Of course your daughter shouldn't be punished for this.", "NTA for not punishing your daughter. The right thing to do, however, is for your daughter to apologize to her cousin for hurting her feelings (not to the doll).", "NTA, this is such a subtle thing to notice for a 10-year-old especially if they have autism, that you cannot punish her for it. Just try to explain to her why is it a bad idea to say something like that to her cousin and that's that. Tell your brother the same thing and if he doesn't like your explanation, so be it.", "I don\u2019t think she needs punished\u2026 but I don\u2019t necessarily think you handled it great either. This should have been a learning emotional intelligence situation for your daughter, but it doesn\u2019t appear you took that opportunity.", "People with autism that have different levels of of autism perceive, the world differently. They are very smart too!\n\nThough your daughter is right that dolls don\u2019t have feelings but she was in the wrong for doing that to her cousin. Yes your daughter apologized but you should have a proper talk with your daughter.\n\nI am not going to vote because I am on the fence about this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And like I said not everything we teach our children needs to be based around punishment.

If your brother wanted to make sure that Ariel didn't learn the truth about doll non-sentience, he should have given you all a heads-up ahead of time so you would know. He absolutely cannot expect other people to keep up his lies for him when they don't even know about the lies--nor is it reasonable to demand that they do so even if they do know.", "Honestly, I think even a neurotypical 10 yr old would have said the same thing.", "Omg NTA. Erin sounds like a lovely girl to apologize for hurting her feelings. That should have been the end of this. Ridiculous to punish someone for this.", "He should know people with autism can be very black and white and black and white dolls don't have feelings NTA", "Sounds like your brother is babying your niece.\n\nI get making her comfortable and letting her rock with what she wants to be into, but not explaining why the baby dolls are just objects could cause problems down the line.\n\nAnd literally your daughter didn't exactly know that she didn't know that.\n\nSo punishing her would be ridiculous. The most you would do would just be to explain things but then it's like what do you explaining??\n\nThat your brother is avoiding explaining something that might be hard for your niece to hear?? NTA", "INFO: Have you had a discussion with your brother to check if you both got the same story?", "NTA, your daughter didn\u2019t do anything wrong and was apologetic for upsetting her cousin. She had no idea that Ariel thought they were real and by the sounds of it if she did she would have had enough empathy to not say anything out of order. This is like the Santa Claus conversation. One kid hears from an older sibling that he isn\u2019t real and of course shares this information with friends. You try to keep them young and innocent for as long as you can but the truth will always come out some how. It\u2019s learning and development and your brother needs to see this as an opportunity both for him to learn how to handle situations like this with his daughter (because they will become increasingly frequent) and also for her to develop further too. It is a very difficult thing but he cannot protect her from everything and needs to be able to deal when situations like this occur. Your daughter showed no malice towards her cousin and therefore deserves no punishment.", "I do wonder if OP and her brother are working off the same information. It seems like both got the story separately from their respective daughters. I would assume that from the brother's reaction they both got different stories and that the truth is somewhere in the middle", "NTA\n\nDad didn't even answer the question if her dolls have feelings! If he doesn't know how to respond, why expect Erin to know? \n\nBut Erin realised from Ariels response that she did believe that, recognised that maybe the doll didn't have feelings but that Ariel did, and apologised.  You should be so proud if her!\n\nAs for him being upset tgat\n\n>I'm not the one who has to deal with Ariel being upset.\n\nWell, maybe if HE hadn't asked you to leave, you and Erin could've helped him out. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's weirdly ableist of your brother to insist your daughter is punished for not properly understanding a social situation. You would be punishing her for something she has a hard time with due to something she can't control.", "NTA and neither is Erin. Your brother probably means well but I don't think going along with Ariel's fantasy life is a good long term strategy. I'm no autism expert so if I'm wrong about that I apologize.", "OMG NTA who lets there kid believe dolls are real people or have feelings?!", "Your comment was lovely, and this internet stranger thinks you should take your well-deserved nap. Be kind to yourself, and keep being an awesome parent."]}
