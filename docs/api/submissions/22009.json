Don\u2019t feel bad and enjoy yourself.", "NTA- The weekend is dedicated to a specific activity. I\u2019m sure no one else\u2019s SO would be in attendance. I would feel weird attending such a weekend if my husband had this tradition. \n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s upset, but asking to come is a bit odd honestly.

You haven't done anything wrong in this situation; it's understandable that you'd like to spend some quality time with your friends without bringing your girlfriend and child along. However, it is important to think through how you phrase your response so that your intentions are clear. You could explain that you would love to have them come along, but that they shouldn't feel bad if they don't join as the idea is to have a weekend focused on just spending quality time with the guys.", "NTA but does she get to have weekends away too?", "Nta", "NAH you are allowed to want time with the guys and she is allowed to feel disappointed that she doesn't get to hang out with you that weekend. No harm no foul.", "YTA. Pick your friends or your family. It doesn't sound like you can have both. Hint: picking your friends is the wrong choice.

Unless your gf is ok with not getting any attention for the whole weekend, she shouldn\u2019t go. The whole point of this trip is for you to get away for a bit and spend time with friends you don\u2019t get to see. This is your time, let her know you want to keep it like that. I\u2019m sure there has been if not will be a time when your gf wants to go somewhere without you. + you probably would not have as much fun w your friends if she went. You prob act different around your friends (not a bad thing, I feel like everyone does) and want to be free to act that way. Also I just replied to a YTA, and to address that one, you should not have to pick. I\u2019m not even sure where stuff like that comes from.", "NTA.

Given you've said that she also gets some weekends to herself, it is completely reasonable for you to say no to her and kiddo gatecrashing your buddies' weekend.
