I won\u2019t go much into his history, as it\u2019s not super relevant. Suffice to say, in spite of his past, he\u2019s a great guy and the love of my life. If he proposed tomorrow, I\u2019d say yes without hesitation. \n\nMy family, on the other hand, have never really liked him all that much. My sister \u2018Sandy\u2019 especially never trusted him at all. I assumed that, since none of my family act openly cold about our relationship anymore, that they had gotten over it. \n\nOn to the incident. Yesterday, we had some family over at our condo for a cookout. I noticed that my niece \u2018Natalie\u2019 (12f, Sandy\u2019s daughter) was acting really jumpy and anxious. I took her aside and asked her what was wrong, and she said that she was nervous about Caleb because \u201cMom warned me that he might act crazy\u201d I asked why, and she said \u201cyou know, because of the drugs\u201d. \n\nI was furious, not with my niece, but with my sister. My boyfriend has been clean for years, he\u2019d never dream of taking anything stronger than a tylenol. I told her (in kid terms) that Caleb has been clean for a long time, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about. She seemed happy about that, and went back to the gathering no problem. \n\nI then went to talk to my sister. I confronted her in private about what she had told Natalie. She didn\u2019t deny it, and justified herself that \u201cyou never know, he could relapse anytime, better safe than sorry. If [Natalie] has to be around an addict, then she should at least know what she\u2019s dealing with\u201d \n\nI was stunned. She hadn\u2019t been this openly hostile about my boyfriend in a long time, and I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was struggling to find the words, when Caleb came around the corner. I\u2019m not sure how much he heard, but judging by the look of hurt on his face, it was more than enough. I told her to get out.\n\nShe tried to argue, but I was firm. None of my other family members stayed much longer either, each finding an excuse to leave. \n\nNow, family has been telling me that my reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d and that she \u201chad a right to protect her daughter\u201d. I know that my sister is wrong about my boyfriend, but now I\u2019m questioning if my reaction was out of proportion.

Your sister is prejudiced, and the only thing her attitude will teach her daughter is that it's okay to be unkind and profess very harmful views about people who have struggled with addiction. Your boyfriend sounds like he has done a lot of work on himself and fought a very difficult disease, and that is to be commended.\n\nPlus, it's your house, and you absolutely do not have to host people in your home who are rude or worse to you or your partner.", "\u201cAITA for defending my partner\u2019s right not to be insulted and demeaned in his own home?\u201d \n\nNo, NTA at all. \n\nYour sister (and whole family tbh) needs to respect your choice of partner and trust that you know what\u2019s best for you. Also, you need to reevaluate your relationships with all of them, they\u2019re toxic beyond belief.", "NTA.  He welcomed your sister into his home for a gathering, and she talked about him like he's trash.  \n\nHe deserves to be safe in his own home.", "NTA. If she was so worried about Caleb and his past drugs she shouldn\u2019t have brought her daughter. If he\u2019s clean and has been for a while I\u2019m sure he\u2019s worried really hard for that and to be talked about so poorly and basically saying he can never be \u201cnormal\u201d or trusted again is very very rude and I don\u2019t blame you at all. I\u2019m sorry to Caleb who had to hear that and I\u2019m happy for him being clean! I\u2019m also sorry you have to be sorta stuck in the middle as it\u2019s your family so I\u2019m sure you feel bad that he\u2019s kinda not accepted. But it\u2019s not your fault!", "Did any of his criminal or drug-related activities personally involve your family? Either way I'd say NTA, but that if they did and he's attempted to apologize for it, your family isn't obligated to forgive him.

I\u2019d like to highlight that I think there\u2019s no danger here and my next sentence is based on your sister\u2019s thinking. But if she was really that worried, she should have chosen not to bring her daughter to Caleb\u2019s house. \n\nInstead, she chose to speak badly about him to her daughter, then brought her daughter to his house, insulted him and expected you both to be okay with it. She\u2019s not actually worried about her daughter\u2019s safety if she\u2019s bringing her to his house. She\u2019s just feeling morally superior.", "NTA unless you're leaving our relevant information on Caleb and what he did in the past. \n\nYour sister is a huge AH for saying that while she knows Caleb's been clean for years and I'm assuming treats you and others well in this time.", "NTA! You did great by standing up for him against her. Sister has no idea what she is talking about, and what she said was insulting, demeaning, and completely out of line. Good job explaining it to niece and nipping that bs in the bud. \n\nCongrats to your boyfriend on the maintained sobriety! I hope he gets the sincere apology that he deserves from her.", "Caleb should be respected in his (your) own home. This is not okay. Your sister and your other family members behaved in a rude, judgmental, and unacceptable manner.  Time to evaluate who is your true family.  \nYou are NTA.  Hug Caleb and tell him how important he is to you.", "She can protect her daughter by leaving your house. If she was really that worried, she wouldn't have come at all. It sounds like Caleb has worked hard to overcome his addiction and is doing well. Good for him.

You have a right to protect your boyfriend. If that means\nYour family gets called out and distanced, oh well.", "NTA It\u2019s your house, your choice who you let in and I think your sister was being unnecessarily rude. That said, I\u2019m not going to blame a parent for giving their kids a heads up to be aware that they are around someone with a criminal history and who is in recovery. She was an ass in The way she did it and spoke to you (obviously over the top in the warning) but yeah, people do relapse and I\u2019m not going to pretend that\u2019s not a possibility just because he seems like a nice guy.

I believe your sister was well within reasonable and responsible parenting to tell your daughter exactly what she did, and I do not intend to judge her for just how carefully or diplomatically she did so.\n\nHowever, I believe there was little you could have done gracefully in that situation except tell your sister to leave. The tension cannot be papered over in a single conversation.", "After reading through the comments, I think I'm going to have to go with ESH.\n\nWhat your sister said to her niece was inappropriate and if she really felt that Caleb was a danger then she shouldn't have brought her in the first place, so she loses the \"I'm trying to protect her\" defense.  But for your part you are dating someone with a sordid past.  Some people will be judgmental.  If you're trying to convince your niece (or any family member for that matter) that you aren't bad dangerous scary people, then kicking them out of your house probably isn't the best look.", "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s also the Arab proverb, \u201cblood is thicker than milk.\u201d, from which it is understood to mean something similar to what you are commenting. The earliest use of the term in relation to Christianity was in the year 1652, was a reference during a sermon by William Jenkyn, saying,\u201d Blood is thicker (we say) then [sic] water; and truly the blood of Christ beautifying any of our friends and children, should make us prefer them before those, between whom and us there\u2019s only a watery relation of nature.\" The original refers to kin-blood, not blood of the covenant.

I am one of those people, as well as a felon, so the logic is beyond me. I ended up going NC with her.... if it stresses you out and you feel disrespected, limit your contact with your sister.  We are capable of change, even if some people don't believe it.", "NAH. You absolutely should defend your boyfriend if you trust him and feel comfortable around him. You know him better than anybody else in the story. Your family also has every right to be wary about his past. He may be clean now, but all it takes is one bad decision for it to all go downhill. \n\nI started dating someone who was an ex-addict and had been clean for 3 years. Everything was perfect. 2 years into our relationship, she went out with friends and had a drink. Within a week she was back to using again, and then she began stealing and pawning off my stuff to support her habit. It can spiral really quickly. I wish you guys the best.", "NTA. She didn't want to protect her daughter, she wanted to talk trash about your boyfriend.

I had two alcoholic parents who died in active addiction.  I have been on all sides of this disease.\n\nPeople are wildly judgemental and make all sorts of asinine assumptions.  It's painful when it comes from loved ones, but at the same time.. I love knowing that if they understood, they'd be jealous.  In order to recover, we have to do so much work on ourselves from which EVERYONE could benefit but never have a reason to do.  We turn out much better people \n\nAlso, our community is THE most supportive, helpful, non-judgemental, welcoming network ON THE PLANET.  I could call any one of 200+ contacts in my phone at 02:47AM, and that person would tell me I'm amazing  and beautiful.
