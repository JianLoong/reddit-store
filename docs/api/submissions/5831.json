How many more of you are there?!\u201d \n\nSome of the kids laughed, most apparently didn\u2019t really get it, and our brother was embarrassed but also didn\u2019t get the reference.

That kind of joke is not only inappropriate and crass, but it made light of the heavy fact that the kid is an orphan being raised by his siblings and opened up a floodgate for bullying. No one with that little social intelligence should be teaching children. Sadly it looks like some people don't understand the damage that teacher did to your brother, hopefully he and his friends feel comfortable with the affection you and your brother give him after that teacher soured it for him.", "NTA. WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING THROUGH THAT TEACHERS HEAD? That\u2019s absolutely disgusting, a teacher who makes incest jokes in a professional setting, TOWARDS A MINOR? Anything that happens to that teacher is on them. Not you.", "NTA. \n\nThis person should not be a teacher. Joking about your parents death and insinuating that you and your sibling are incestuous is utterly unprofessional, crass and frankly mind blowing. They have implanted this idea into the heads of your brother's class mates. This is how people get bullied and  become the subject of rumours that can have devastating effects on their life. He deserves to loose his job for being so callous. Life is hard enough without an adult rubbing salt in the wounds.", "NTA \n\nAs former teacher myself I would never allow this in my classroom and if I knew other teacher did, I would report them myself. \n\nGood for you for protecting your siblings and you did right for reporting to principal.", "NTA. It's not alright to make a kid feel unsafe or uncomfortable at school. It's doubly not okay for a teacher to do it. It's triply not okay for a teacher to do it to a child with unique circumstances. \n\nThat teacher deserves a harsh punishment for creating a reason for bullying. It shouldn't be an issue, but attitudes like that make problems.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t a \u2018joke\u2019 and it\u2019s not funny. It was an adult teacher bullying a student. They SHOULD lost their job. You and your brother have your hands full without this kind of crap. Your younger siblings are lucky to have you two and I am sorry for the loss of your parents.", "NTA -\n\nNo one should make jokes at anyone\u2019s expense, especially for someone they don\u2019t know. Your brother is young, he will get over being afraid to do things in front of his friends. It\u2019s a thing all middle school kids go through. It\u2019s normal.\n\nThe joke will blow over everyone\u2019s heads, it\u2019s Christmas break. I doubt it\u2019ll be mentioned once schools back in session. If the joke hurt your brother then obviously you\u2019re not the AH for caring about his feelings. School should be a safe place. I never liked when teachers would join in with students to pick on me. So i understand.", "NTA, not one iota.\n\nIF the teacher gets fired, that\u2019s the teacher\u2019s problem. Good on you for standing up for your siblings and escalating this issue to the school administration. That was beyond inappropriate to say, and especially learning that the same teacher has made the same references to your 16 year old. Recurring pattern. Not funny.", "NTA school is hard enough without teachers giving others ammunition to bully or insult. I don't believe the school would fire someone for a first offence anyway. If they have a history of it then it's on them.", "NTA - The sub made an extremely tasteless and inappropriate joke to a kid in front of that kid\u2019s entire class. He has made the kid insecure and a point of teasing. The school should absolutely be made aware of the sub\u2019s behavior and they can deal with it in whatever way they see fit. Those consequences are out of your hands, and honestly if they are him being fired, he brought it on himself.", "NTA. In fact not only is the teacher TA, but your friends are too for even entertaining that joke. \n\nDeadass next time you see them tell them to explain the joke to you. Why\u2019s it so funny? \n\nI had a teacher make a similar joke after my dad died on the day of his funeral. I think about it to this day. You didn\u2019t take it too far. Take it as far as you can. That person has no business being around kids if that\u2019s how they treat them when they\u2019re vulnerable", "NTA. That teacher shouldnt be around kids if she doesnt appreciate individual circumstances.", "NTA\u2026 that is a disgusting joke and whatever comes to that teacher is their own fault. Also, I\u2019d seriously reconsider your friend group", "NTA. It was a very insensitive comment by the teacher and also inappropriate.  Your \"friend\" is also in the wrong. I think may e you should ditch that toxic person. They don't have the maturity to see the big picture or the harm done.", "Clearly NTA. She created a hostile environment for your sibling as a former teacher i have never these kind of jokes.

Can someone please explain it to me? \ud83d\ude05", "NTA\n\nThe comment was quite inappropriate in that setting and highly risky even if it's made in a close-knit circle. The teacher needs to learn that risky jokes and comments are, well, risky.\n\nOr better to just not make them, especially around kids aged 14 because, honestly, that usually backfires (just like this did).\n\nFor what it's worth, it's always better to calm down before reacting outwardly, although it's sometimes really, really hard to do that. I would have also been quite pissed by a teacher making such a comment TBF.", "NTA.\n\nYou're never the one 'doing something to someone' if you are simply telling the truth about what happened.

He\u2019d made the same joke to your sister.

Whether or not you overreacted is irrelevant, but you failed to handle the situation like you should've done as an adult.\n\nWhy go and and meet senior staff to try and get this person fired? Why not meet the teacher in question and tell him that you found his comment completely inappropriate and demand an apology?

Maybe you should before you judge OP, I can't use the words that describe plot because I d probably be deleted. \n\nAnd then you would know that \"poor joke\" is really an insult and should be reported.

Agree - extremely inappropriate! Obviously NTA", "How though? Because married couples have the same last names no? And also were both your names on the attendance sheet?", "And the sub is an adult. He should know better", "[deleted]", "I don't disagree that it was wildly inappropriate! It is, but the question is whether you could've handled this more gracefully and whether firing the person is proportional or not, compared to what he has done.\n\nPerhaps a good talk and a slap on the wrist suffices and this teacher never does something like that again. You only know if you try that first. That would be the better option over firing him. At least I think it is.\n\nPerhaps it has to do with me not being American. We don't fire people so easily where I live, but give them a second chance.", "Fair enough. I think that's a fair demand to make. Your story got muddled a bit in my head when replying.\n\nI also agree with you that talking to the teacher probably wouldn't change much to the story. However, realize that you can only be 100% sure if you actively seek out the other part of the story. It would've also given the teacher the opportunity to explain or apologize.", "Wait a moment. So you\u2019re telling me the teacher ALSO had a nickname for their female student that directly referenced a story with incestual/sexual context? \n\nI would probably bring that up as well.", "The teacher knows us and our situation because they taught our 16yo previously and had met us multiple times. I send out an email to all my siblings\u2019 new teachers every year to let them know our situation. So when they saw 14yo\u2019s surname, they knew he was another sibling.\n\nHope that makes sense.", "Here's the thing, if someone said this in a company and HR got involved, this person would have been fired as well. Why do you think a teacher should get immunity from a hostile work environment issue?", "I just realized you said they should be punished, but honestly I would classify this as sexual harassment and teination is appropriate.", "I think a teacher making sexual jokes towards a student should be treated very harshly \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I'm not American either and I think making an incest joke is a  fireable offense for a teacher to make, especially since it was done in front of the entire class and the sister mentioned it was not the first time the teacher had been inappropriate.", "Sounds like it :/ She only told me this a few days ago. I will bring it up when school starts again, along with all the other things she has told me. She never told us at the time because she already knew what the reference was and didn\u2019t want to upset us. \n\nI could see the teacher saying it was unrelated though as her name is somewhat similar.", "I think it very much depends on the facts. We both agree that it's inappropriate for a teacher to make such a joke.\n\nI also agree the teacher could be fired if it is a repeat offense, but only if he's reprimanded for this kind of behavior before."]}
