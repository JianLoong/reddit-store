Your friends are idiots. \n\nMaking a \u201cfunny joke\u201d implying incest to a student is seriously messed up.", "NTA. That wasn't a \"joke\", it was a shitty, mean-spirited comment made to a teenager in front of a roomful of his peers. It embarrassed him, set him up for bullying, and appears to be changing the way he views his relationship with you. I vehemently hope this teacher gets fired, and it sounds like you might need to fire your shitty \"friends\" too.", "NTA. This teacher needs to reread the books because it isn\u2019t some edgy literary reference joke and I\u2019m surprised children even understood since it\u2019s banned in many districts for the themes. It is literally a trauma story designed to shock and draw emotion from readers. How you miss that and then apply that to ACTUAL, REAL PEOPLE is beyond me. Fired is an understatement. Like, are they calling kids Lovely Bones? Or Color Purple babies?", "NTA this teacher has targeted venerable children twice with a horrible joke, given bully fodder to a bunch of jerk age kids.

That\u2019s an extremely inappropriate comment for a teacher to make.", "NTA I wasn\u2019t familiar with the term \u201eflowers in the attic\u201c so I looked it up. I really this teacher will be fired.", "NTA\n\nThat teacher fully deserves to get fired", "NTA for complaining! That was inappropriate.

What a weird reference as well, considering Party of Five also exists, and I\u2019m not making a joke of it, I\u2019m pointing out that the teacher has focussed on the story about incest even though in FitA the parents are alive. He\u2019s a weirdo.", "NTA.  That teacher knew she was making an incest joke and that is not ok.", "NTA- I work in special education. You absolutely did the right thing. What else has this jerk said to other kids?  I think kids in high school are even more vulnerable than elementary kiddos in some ways and this was a personalized attack.

You\u2019re not just standing up for your family but for other kids.", "Nta, adults who like to bully children should not be teachers.", "NTA. Your friends are though. Why on earth would they expect people to make comments like that?? That teacher deserves to lose her job.

The teacher may lose their job, but as someone who is supposed to help form these young people, if they make jokes like that, they shouldn't have that job.\n\nThe jobs of people who do harm in their employed positions are not holy or free accountability. Of they don't deserve it, they shouldn't have it.\n\nThere is plenty of other work that they could apply for when they won't do as much damage.", "NTA, but you requesting someone be fired over a comment is extreme.

I know I\u2019m going to get down voted for saying it, but we all make inappropriate jokes. That joke should have stayed between the teacher and their partner.

Anyone who thinks mocking a student at all is appropriate shouldn't be a teacher.", "NTA at all. That teacher deserves to be reported.", "Yeah, let make jokes about our students family circumstances\u2026 I know, let\u2019s start with the kids whose parents are dead - that\u2019ll be a real hoot! If incest jokes are what springs to mind (\u201cand should be expected\u201d) when a pair of siblings are taking on the extremely selfless and challenging guardian-role, then that teacher deserves to lose her job because she shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near kids. Oh, and you need new friends. NTA Gods luck to your family. You and your brother - keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", ">They said it was a joke ... that it was pretty funny.\n\nSomeone needs to explain to me how humiliating bereaved kids in front of the entire class is a joke.\n\nNTA, this teacher is a bully and needs to be fired.  Re-evaluate those friendships.", "NTA jokes are supposed to be funny. Fita was not a funny movie in the slightest. The fact the 14 year old is now being bullied for it is the teacher fault.", "NTA\n Go harder. They should lose their job.

Very gross.", "Yeah, it was a joke.", "Yta", "If he\u2019s ever asked why he got fired he can just say \u201coh I made an incest joke about a child whose parents died.\u201d Not a single soul will defend him. NTA.", "Completely uncalled for. That moment is going to stick with that kid, potentially for the rest of their life.\n\nI had a high school bully that really tormented me, but my worst high school memory isn't even any of that. Far and away the moment that has haunted me more was when a teacher made fun of a physical feature of mine. Having that sort of thing come from a teacher is devastating. And mine is peanuts compared to this.", "Agreed - if teacher losses their job, it is their own fault.  Though perhaps your friends were just saying demanding someone be fired vs. reporting the teacher (in other words deferring punishment to school policy) was being an AH.  Also, I don\u2019t know where you are located and what the school officials said to you, but it might not even be that simple anyhow in that teachers have rights and schools may have set disciplinary policies.", "ive musta found a different definition cause it didnt mention incest, whats it mean?", "It sucks even more because besides his actual friends, 14yo does not make it public knowledge that he is being raised by his siblings. He doesn\u2019t want the attention or to have a million questions about it. He likes to blend in. So he refers to us as his mom and dad, and as far as anyone knew, his family is normal. Now that these kids all know the real situation, the \u2018mom and dad\u2019 thing is even worse because it makes it sound like we\u2019ve been acting like a married couple and that he actually calls us that. \n\nHe is dreading going back to school and having to face all the comments, questions and jokes. I am praying he doesn\u2019t start getting bullied over it.", "The whole series of books is messed up.

Your family didn\u2019t get that. I assure that if you find some teachers and/or parents in the 30-something range in the school district that they will flip tables at this story.", "This makes no sense. If the teacher thought there was actual incest happening, then they should be sending the student to the counselor and calling CPS, not cracking jokes in front of the class.

That\u2019s (sort of) what happens in the movie.", "Family friend so they knew your parents, and they think it's appropriate for a teacher to make incest jokes to an orphan? Is that the people your parents would want to be friends with?", "NTA I really admire and fiercely respect what you and your sibling are doing.

But no one should need to know family history to understand \"jokes\" like that, while possibly ok to some people with very old friends in a casual setting, are beyond unacceptable in any kind of professional setting, and particularly around children.", "It literally doesn't matter that the teacher would, understandably, have no idea as to the history of abuse that may or may not be present in your family.\n\nThe fact of the matter *is* that teacher's shouldn't be making jokes to texts like that towards their students, especially knowing how impressionable kids are and how likely they would be to weaponise the same joke and turn it into bullying.\n\nLike, is it anymore appropriate if the teacher called a kid a Twilight kid because there's an age gap between their parents?", "You and OP changed my mind somewhat!\n\nStill not sure if I agree with your comment that going to the principal immediately is the correct way to handle.

But the principal is responsible for overseeing the professionalism of the staff, so should know if a complaint is being made. \n\nThis case, however, is so bad, I wouldn't bother talking to the teacher, and I don't think a 22 year old should have to confront the teacher directly about why it was inappropriate for him to be making incest/ abuse jokes about her relationship with her brother.
