Though we still get some comments at parents\u2019 evenings and correspondence from school is often sent to \u201cMr and Mrs (our surname)\u201d. We are used to it and it\u2019s usually no big deal, sometimes pretty funny. \n\nWhat I did NOT find funny was my 14yr old coming home from school saying he had a substitute teacher (the teacher works at the same school full time but doesn\u2019t normally take any of our brother\u2019s classes) and as they took the register and saw his surname, the teacher said, \n\n\u201cAnother Flowers in the Attic kid! How many more of you are there?!\u201d \n\nSome of the kids laughed, most apparently didn\u2019t really get it, and our brother was embarrassed but also didn\u2019t get the reference. A bunch of the kids googled it in their next break and were laughing about it later on in the day.\n\n(This teacher has taught our 16yr old previously (for a year) so we had met them multiple times at parents\u2019 night. She has since told me they made comments to her too.)\n\nWhen my brother came home and told me what happened, and asked me what Flowers in the Attic is, I was really pissed off. We have had several similar comments before and I don\u2019t find them funny, but it\u2019s next level out of order IMO to say something like that to a young teenager. Let alone in front of classmates. \n\nI complained to the school about it the next day. I went in a little strong but I was PISSED. I met with the principal and another senior staff member (waited over an hour for them to be free). I told them at the very least I don\u2019t want any of the kids being taught by that teacher ever again. I think it will be dealt with after Christmas break, as this was right at the end of their last week. I got the impression they will likely be fired. My older brother followed up with an email to back me up and create a record of it.\n\nWe saw some friends yesterday and told them about the incident. They were horrified but not at the teacher, at ME for complaining about it. They said it was a joke and I may have just cost someone their job. They think I overreacted and that it was pretty funny. They said of course people will make FitA comments because my brother and I are close and affectionate. I don\u2019t feel that I should need to say that it would never be anything like that, but to be crystal clear, there is nothing remotely sexual about our relationship. \n\nOur 14yr old has been pretty embarrassed about it ever since. For the first time ever he asked me not to hug or kiss him when I dropped him off to meet his friends. He\u2019s worried about kids bullying him when he goes back to school.\n\nETA: just spoke to 16yo. She says she thinks it started after our first parents\u2019 night when this teacher met us and saw us interact. Most likely we arrived separately and my brother greeted me with a hug and a kiss on the cheek/forehead. I probably also had my youngest sister on my hip. Scandalous! \n16yo says that might have given off \u201cfamily vibes\u201d. \nIn reality I was probably stressed as hell because I hate parents\u2019 night and 16yo used to be a terror.

Easy answer: People write weird fiction. It's pushing the boundaries to explore uncomfortable topics. \n\nLonger answer:\nThat book in particular was based on a story she heard from a friend who \"knew someone\" that were twins maybe in a relationship, gossip. She wrote about them stuck in the attic because she had a very intense life of disability and isolation, living in an upstairs room and writing most of her days. She was writing about that isolation and was focused on hard awful things in life. \n\nBUT important to note that the later books were written under her name after she died by someone else! They're like...fanfiction. the first few are her actual sad story. Some later ones were written with more \"romance\" and lose a lot of the tragedy from the original story she wrote.\n\nThe books are tragedy more than romance (imo) are more about how messed up generations can be from the cruelty or bad decisions of the generations prior. There's a lot of abuse in the family tree & bad choices to escape that abuse. The kids in the book... their parents were related but ran away to be together and escape abusive family that controlled them.\n Then the kids the book focuses on are the \"happy generation\" that escaped absue... til their mother chooses to hand them over to the abusive grandparents to save herself. Then they waste away in the attic and try to maintain \"healthy lives\" while locked away. It doesn't go well and they become unhealthy attached. It follows them even once they escape, and the abuse / bad choices have left them to carry the burden. While trying not to be like those generations and trying to not make bad choices. But they still make bad choices sadly. Then tragedy keeps following them. \n\nNo character is the good moral center really. It's like Romeo & juliet, misread as a romance when it's a tragedy. \n\nIt's great to read \"dark fiction\" with critical eye, not like a fun story where the moral is positive. It's more like what NOT to do, and exploring bad choices. Like those dark Grimm fairytales. Vs the Disney remakes.

And those kids will latch onto anything to keep the spotlight off of themselves and any unusual or embarrassing things they may have gping on. Is it right?
