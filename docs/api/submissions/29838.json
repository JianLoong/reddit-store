{"id": 29838, "submission_id": "17igncg", "title": "AITA (22F) for not coming home from work because my husband was sick (23M)", "selftext": "\nBackstory: my husband gets extremely sick if he doesn\u2019t take a prescribed medication for his stomach ulcers. He was diagnosed 2 years ago and recently stopped taking his meds as he \u201cfeels better\u201d. My husband also doesn\u2019t do well with sickness and is the same guy who takes time off when he gets a cold but expects me to keep down the fort when I got my tonsils out, flus, and a cesarean in July 2022. \n\nSo last night my husband (23 M) decided to go out with buddies to beer and pizza. We both work and I work nights except these past two days. I have worked early mornings as he has these two days off. Before he left, I reminded him to take his pill so he can have a beer and food as his condition is so fragile that one beer can put him in the hospital ( he doesn\u2019t listen to his doctor when she said no alcohol). He said no to the pill and was on his way. He was out last night until 3 am this morning and I told him that I don\u2019t care if he stays out however he needs to be up to watch our toddler while I work. I wake him up this morning and go to work. 20 minutes in, I get 14 calls begging me to come home as he\u2019s profusely vomiting acid and alcohol and cannot watch our toddler. I explain that I cannot leave work at the moment and to ask family or people around us before I come home. Note: my job is the kind of job that is not one where you can just leave work. While in a very important meeting, I was stuck with calling family, friends, and sitters seeking childcare for my husband who brought this on himself. Not only did this affect my work for the day worrying about them both but my bosses noticed it and I was told it was disrespectful.\n\n I don\u2019t know how to feel. He says I should have come home immediately however I feel that I told him what to do to avoid this and still he didn\u2019t listen. I just need to know, should I have left to go back home to take care of him and my toddler after I told him to take his meds?\n\nUPDATE: After reading your comments, I spoke with my husband this morning and set clear boundaries. He must take his medicine and listen to his doctor from now on about avoiding and limiting certain foods and drinks. I also explained my feelings that he purposefully made himself sick to avoid helping. I explained that if I was the one who was sick, he wouldn\u2019t be coming home to help and I would be on my own. I explained if this happens again, he will not call me and text me about this problem and/or finding childcare. Thank you to everyone who helped show me that what I was feeling was not wrong. I also suggested couples counseling and even AA. I believe (along with those who messaged me) that if he needs to drink even tho he has been told by doctors that he absolutely should not drink then he has a drinking problem and it should be taken to counseling. We are currently discussing next steps. I understand by reading the comments that I am not the asshole however, I am at fault for enabling this behavior. I have told him that I will no longer coddle him and he\u2019s an adult and makes adult decisions so he can deal with adult consequences.

Your husband is obviously TA for refusing to take care of his health and having that affect everyone around him. But you are TA because the person who was most affected was your toddler, who cannot care for himself and who is an innocent party. Something bad could have happened since your husband was unable to care for him, and you put your feelings about your husband's state over the more urgent need to care for the child. What if the child had hurt himself while being unsupervised for hours? \n\nYour boss was already unhappy with you - you should have gone home in order to ensure your child was cared for. You need to address the issue of the medications with your husband as well, but the child should have been the #1 priority. Knowingly leaving him with someone unable to care for him is not the right move, regardless of the reason why that person cannot care for him.", "I'm wondering what you get out of this relationship.

And self-respect. And respect for others. And a general understanding of how a body works. And a need to be a responsible enough human being not to risk another person's livelihood over their own selfishness.\n\nHave you considered the fact that he is purposely doing this as a way to 1) get out of adulting 2) have no responsibilities 3) force you to compromise yourself and your job as a way to demonstrate that he is the only focus in your life?\n\nLeave him. This will only get worse\n\nNTA.", "NTA Does he have a day job or is he responsible for taking care of the house and child during the day?

He doesn\u2019t take care of you when you are sick, but intentionally gets sick and forces you to take care of him?", "I'd say it depends entirely on how this toddler is.\n\nIf the toddler is, say, 18 months, then you would be a huge asshole because no matter how much of an idiot your husband is, *an 18 month old has got to be watched with laser-focus*, at least when they're not in a fenced-in playpen. And even then...   they're constantly doing things that could hurt/kill them. \n\nOn the other hand, if the toddler is 3.5yo like mine (pretty much past toddlerhood), he could be left to his own devices in the living room if I was in the bathroom vomiting. He'd know to come get me if he wanted anything, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seriously....   what the hell is up with your husband's complete lack of judgment?", "You left your toddler with your other toddler, it seems. He sounds like an incredibly useless and annoying partner, though I'm sure he has some redeeming qualities. NTA, but either lay down some boundaries or make some hard decisions. Seems your life would be easier with only one child to take care of.", "I'm very sorry, OP, but the person you describe is irresponsible and immature, and unlikely to change as long as he's got an enabler around to play the grownup and to save him from the consequences of his own behavior.\n\nIf you don't want to be his enabler, then it's sad to say that if you stop enabling irresponsible acts like drinking alcohol, then there's good odds that he would prefer to end the relationship and find someone who will enable his irresponsibility than to grow up and become responsible.  So do try to get him to individual counseling to discuss his self-destructive behavior, but if his goal is to find a way to get away with it rather than to stop, then counseling won't fix him.  Couples counseling has to be tried, but again, there are no guarantees that it will produce change.", "NTA you should have left the marriage not your job.
