Reassure her that your husband can be there in X hours if anything happens. I'd also suggest visiting her a few times during the 4 months that you're away and inviting her to visit you all as well. I went through something similar with my mom when I took projects in other states. I made an effort to visit her more during that time than I did living 30 minutes away.

My husband and I legally adopted her.) \n\nGranddaughter used to spend school holiday breaks with me and 4-6 weeks during the summer.  The last time she begged me to come 'back home', and I told her we wouldn't ever be moving back,  I get a text that I can now only see my granddaughter while visiting her.  She is no longer allowed to come see me.  Daughter won't come see me because her husband 'hates the Beach'. \n\nI understand her feelings of abandonment.  She moved back in with us when my granddaughter was 3 months old and moved out with her boyfriend (now husband) when granddaughter was 5, and just weeks before we moved to the Beach.  My granddaughter (7) and I are extremely close. And if I *really* loved and cared for her and my granddaughter...I would never have moved and realize how much they both need me there.  She even has my granddaughter begging me to come 'stay with them for awhile'. Ugh! The guilt of wanting to be there and protect my daughter and granddaughter and love living at the Beach.", "Nta. They are though", "Frankly visiting them once a month sounds like too much, especially for a woman trying to dictate your living arrangements.", "MIL could be anywhere between 45 - 73.

The family was sick and didn't want to  pass it to anyone. (Pre covid)\n\nOne of the kids refused to eat her food, (kid liked plain food she adds heaps of salt). Of course that was DILs fault for not feeding the child enough proper Asian food.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell the paerents they don't get a vote.", "NTA.

Did the dad forget to cut the umbilical cord when the doctor asked?", "NTA - MIL is entitled to her feelings but to try to get you to change plans bc of them is a little much.

Sounds like you and your husband have a system that works out well for the 2 of you, despite the distance. And y'all adapted it to the new situation. A lot of couples would have foundered here, and healthy parents would be glad that y'all have found a way to make it all work. Disappointed that there may be less visits FOR A FEW MONTHS, and perhaps concerned about finding an OBGYN in a new city, but proud and supportive. If he was primarily responsible for caring for disabled parents, that would be another story, but \"What if there's an emergency?\" Sorry it's inconvenient, but is there nobody else they can rely on?\n\nYou and your husband are partners responding to the realities of balancing jobs with a kiddo on the way. Congratulations to y'all both, and sorry that your MiL tried to make y'all's lives revolve around her. Best of luck, OP!", "NTA\n\nHe's not mommy's little paramedic. He can fly back in an emergency. Lots of people move away from home, even thousands of miles away, they shouldn't let the theoretical possibility of an emergency stop them.\n\nI'd be wary of her faking emergencies to see how quickly her son responds, though, and discussing that possibility with your husband and what to do if she tries that.", "Definitely NTA to put your job and family (you, hubby, and baby) first. Given the reaction of your MIL, you might want to look at making this temporary move a bit more permanent. It sounds like she needs to realize that her son is a grown man with his own responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nYou're married, your husband is moving to be with you, now that your are pregnant. MIL is nuts - her son left them when he married you.\n\nAnyway, your husband should step in to manage his mother - nobody should have to put up with hassle from in-laws, least of all when pregnant.", "Wow, the problem in that scenario is NOT what I thought it was going to be.\n\nI was expecting you to have troubles because your husband was not going to be with you, or that parents were mystified that you were not moving in with THEM after learning you are pregnant.  Nope.\n\nAre his parents extremely elderly or infirm?  I wouldn't think so because you guys are pretty young.  Is he normally a caregiver of some fashion for them?  If not, they should have NO expectations of their adult son living near them.  Do they have constant and real legitimate needs?  Or is it that there is the call once a month to change the lightbulb in the attic, or twice a year to change batteries in the smoke detectors?

It doesn't matter what they want. You and your spouse have to do what is best for the both of you. This is also only temporary. They'll get over it and be over the moon when the baby comes. They're being really weird actually, saying you're 'taking their son away from them' even though this is a temporary work placement?

Your husband, coming to be with you, is making where you are home as well.  \n\n\nThe fact that they don't like it is their problem.  And good on your husband.", "wth.. the MIL is a real piece of work. Don't let her influence your decisions, in fact, go no contact with her for a while until you figure it out. You really don't need her to be stressing you out right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA and your husband is a hero. He has handled this expertly and maturely.

How in heck did they survive before they had a baby?? They can't do anything on their own. Let them be farking unhappy. boo hoo on them.\n\nYour husband is married to you, seems like he is going to move to be with you. MIL is the AH here. I hope he doesn't reconsider. This is a grownass woman here, not a petulant child. (I would hope).\n\nShe'll get over it or she won't. Either way they can stay sad and mope if they want. their loss. and if they keep it up it is possible they could end up driving their own son away.", "NTA. And how refreshing to read about a husband who actually supports his wife and prioritizes her and his marriage over his self-absorbed mother.", "NTA. I'm glad your husband is also not being childish and is compensating both sides by still moving with you and trying to get work from home whilst still promising to visit his parents once a month. Your in laws seem to be TA here. It could also be because they want to be close to their grandchild when they're born, but in that case they should move closer to you, not the other way around.", "NTA- kids move away. She is not the main character in this show.", "NTA.  His parents are adults and need to handle their own issues.", "MIL needs to fuck off", "NTA", "NTA... If his parents have an emergency they can call the emergency numbers.... They are not being reasonable.", "You are NTA.  He is married to you. You are pregnant with his baby.  His first two responsibilities are to you and his baby, as yours are to him and your baby. Parents' responsibility is to teach their children how to be adults and let them go their own way. His mother should be ashamed of herself for wanting to be placed ahead of spouse and child but probably won't be able to figure out why she is wrong.", "NTA.  You are allowed to have an adult life where you choose where you and your family live.  Your mil is an unreasonable AH who is only caring about herself.  Good luck with the new job and new baby :)", "NTA", "NTA let his mom be upset, he has a kid on the way and she needs to get used to not being a priority over you and the kid. There are going to more situations that she is going to be upset about and you guys have to get used to her having a tantrum.", "NTA for MIL.\n\nBut, make sure you aren't in new city alone while pregnant.\n\nYou would be the A H if you stay there for work, while husband can't join. Because it's not a permanent move and your whole support and family is in original city. You'd be AH Because you need support and deny husband being part of pregnancy and helping you+child.", "That and this: many times, children take jobs to move AWAY from demanding parents.

NTA OP, your husband's response indicates commitment to your relationship and the family you are making.
