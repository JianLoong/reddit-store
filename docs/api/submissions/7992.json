MIL's reaction was quite extreme. Is there a logical reason for it? Does your husband take care of her or something? NTA, regardless, but I'd suggest handling the MIL with compassion. Reassure her that your husband can be there in X hours if anything happens. I'd also suggest visiting her a few times during the 4 months that you're away and inviting her to visit you all as well. I went through something similar with my mom when I took projects in other states. I made an effort to visit her more during that time than I did living 30 minutes away. Something about the distance between mother and child  makes mothers a little crazy no matter how old their child is. It's not an excuse to behave badly, but if you react compassionately it can go a long way to easing her fears.", "NTA\n\nMil realizes that you may be more important than her and she can't stand it.", "NTA - this is a temporary situation and your husband has made the choice to be near and support you rather than missing important parts of the pregnancy, which is a time when he can start bonding with your child.\n\nYour husband should explain to his parents that the same reasons they don\u2019t want to be separated from *their* \u201cchild\u201d are the exact reasons he doesn\u2019t want to be apart from his, and he should reassure them that he\u2019ll communicate regularly and keep them updated on their grandchild and himself - that much is reasonable.\n\nBut they don\u2019t get to bully you for a choice your husband made, and they are overreacting to this. They will see you regularly and can travel themselves if they want more access, but your husband is quite capable of using the phone and so are they, so they won\u2019t be far out of touch.", "NTA, this is only one of many decisions that you and your husband will make together that may not be popular with family members, it does not make you an asshole for doing this.", "So 2 months ago you were asking AITA for wanting phone sex with your boyfriend.
