Reassure her that your husband can be there in X hours if anything happens. I'd also suggest visiting her a few times during the 4 months that you're away and inviting her to visit you all as well. I went through something similar with my mom when I took projects in other states. I made an effort to visit her more during that time than I did living 30 minutes away.
