Its just unpaid leave\n\n\nThe subordinate could be terminated.  I don't think op gave a great overview of the situation.  And every company has to provide some sort of benefits in regards to time off. If you continuesly miss work, they can be let go.", "Is it? Most people need to request the time off, even if it comes from their PTO allowance.", "You\u2019re assuming that I\u2019m assuming about an assumption!", "PTO is part of the package. If you can't let your people use their PTO, your business isn't very good .", "PTO and FMLA are two very different things", "Also, small businesses exist. The company I work employs two people including the owner. I have a lot of flexibility but I can\u2019t take off work whenever I feel like it, I have to coordinate with my boss to make sure at least one of us can attend meetings and such. It was a mess when my dad and her mom died at almost the same time, but we made it work!", "If they have the PTO coming to them, you don't get to say what is foolish.", "No, you need enough employees so if one is not available workload can evenly distribute between the remaining ones. People can leave anytime and if that happening jeopardizes your company, you are not staffed correctly.", "OP wouldn't worry about saying no if she wasn't.", "If she has documentation and it meets the criteria than it does.\n\nNeither you nor her boss gets to decide what qualifies for FMLA.\n\n(Spoiler alert: caring for a family member does qualify. And you have no idea what else may be going on that she needs to care for this child with for a week. Maybe she doesn't want to disclose to her boss, considering he clearly came and posted on Reddit.)", "Where does it says she's using PTO?", "Yes, completely agree.  I think jusgement hinges on whether employee is using accumulated sick time/PTO, or just trying to take days off for whatever excuse she can find.  A week off for her child to get glasses is extremely excessive and makes me suspicious.", "But it's still not clear whether employee is actually using PTO, or is just taking advantage of an accommodating small business by taking a week off for a task that can be completed in less than a day.", "Hahaha indeed.", "This!!", "Agreed, everyone in here like \"send her across own to the HR building\". In a lot of small business the Owner is the scheduler and the HR department.", "I don't know why everyone in here is assuming she even has any. She's seems like she uses more than she has. I agree that if you have PTO you should be able to take it, but it doesn't mean taking a week of for you r kid getting glasses isn't foolish. And lets say she does have PTO but this week will uses it up, what is your answer next time when she needs it for some other thing?", "I think the opposite, if it was PTO there wouldn't be a question. \n\nHe's worried he's a bad guy for telling someone with a sick child they can't take any more days off because they lack PTO.  \n\nThat's why he feel like an AH because he wish he he could give her the day off but she used so many days already that it's just not feasible. \n\nSee how he can worry about it without it being about her using PTO", "Of course he would. If he grants her unpaid leave then Mary is overworked and burnt out. That\u2019s an issue.", "Well yeah caring for a family member qualifies...that's the whole point of an FMLA lol fucking stupid \n\nWatching your kid wear glasses for a week isn't gonna get approved but if it's really a med thing then Jane should have no problem at all getting documentation to take the whole week off! I think OP's attempt to compromise is completely reasonable and expected. It sounds like Jane is just taking advantage", "Where does it say she isn't?", "For sure. I do think it's none of ops business why, though. The only concern is coverage, and if they have the time accumulated. You can be denied if there isn't coverage.  Also, if you get denied and you take time anyway, you could also be terminated.\n\n\nThe employee sounds flaky.  But I also would like to know what other medical leave they took. Op makes it sound casual. What if there was a cancer diagnosis or something to that affect. Op isn't exactly being 100 percent forth coming.", "Ahh you\u2019re right, just re-read the bit about not having a doctor\u2019s note at the end, which she wouldn\u2019t need if it were a PTO request.", "Hahaha", "Easy, if she didn't have any PTO, he wouldn't worry about being TA. \n\nUse a little common sense", "Then he is using this subreddit to make himself feel better.", "You're the one saying she is as if it's a fact.", "Isn't that what everyone here does? \n\nThey feel they did nothing wrong and come here to see if they are right.......to feel better about themselves.", "He wouldn't worry about being TA of she weren't.", "You already said that and I responded. \n\n\nStill disagree with you though. \n\nLife has more than one situation that can lead people to the same results . It's not just the one you think", "He'd also answer a question or two. He hasn't", "Nope also again not every situation here is black and white. \n\nA lot of people on reddit post on their lunch break and come back to the results later. Why not just admit you may be wrong and you're just guessing here lol"]}
