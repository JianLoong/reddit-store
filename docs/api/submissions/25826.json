(Btw they are also my next door neighbors). Earlier this morning, I received a text from the Mom (probably in her 30\u2019s). She has 3 kids with her husband (also probably in his 30\u2019s). The 2 oldest kids are twins (5F and 5M). They also have a baby (M 2-3). The text I received from the mom was her asking me if I\u2019m free for 2 hours to watch the TWINS. She said the twins and did NOT mention anyone else. I said yes and when it was time I walked next door and into their backyard where they told me to go. As I opened the gate, a mother and 2 kids walked in behind me. Weird I thought but at first shrugged it off, until I saw a bounce house blown up, and an outdoor table set with a bucket of forks, knifes, spoons, and an ice cream station. They were having a party. And wanted ME, just ME nobody else, to watch over the kids. The kids started to pile in with more and more moms with their kids. In the end, around 15 kids were there, from the ages of 1 YEAR OLD, to 6 YEARS OLD. Very young. I have babysat kids around those ages before, but 2 at a time. Not 15. I was completely shocked. And the mom was so casual about it. Not anything like, oh sorry, I forgot to mention. Nothing. When I was out of the 6 moms sight, I quickly texted my mom to vent and explain how many kids I was watching. My mom could here and see all the kids from next door. I then went back to watching the kids as they played on the bounce house, shoved each other, ate pizza, make ice cream, and keep playing. I ended up staying a bit over the time she asked as well, because not everyone was gone yet. Also, tomorrow is the first day of school. I just feel like I just waisted the last HOURS of my summer. I had no plans today, except to go to the mall and get my nails done, and I finished that before I babysat, but I would\u2019ve much rather sat on my couch while watching some tv. Instead, I watched 15 kids, and got paid 30 dollars. I don\u2019t usually care about how much or little I get paid when babysitting, but I was disappointed. I usually charge 13 dollars per hour, which my mom says isn\u2019t a lot, and whenever I tell people they say to raise my rates. I don\u2019t care, because I enjoy hanging out and watching kids. But when I charge 13 dollars an hour, that for 1-4 kids. Not 15. I get it I got paid 15 dollars an hour, but I was watching 15 kids, I was expecting more. And when I told my mom when I got home, she thought I deserved ATLEAST 50 if not more. Also, I\u2019m on my period and have cramps, it was painful to be standing for all that time that I was, and this is one of the first times I\u2019ve had cramps, I\u2019m not used to it. So I wasted the last hours of my summer, and did that in pain. The Mom asked me if I would ever do something like this again, and I said yes to be polite, but honestly, I don\u2019t ever want to babysit this family again, no matter how many kids I\u2019m babysitting. So, AITA for not wanting to babysit this family ever again?\n\nEDIT: I was not alone they were sitting on the patio but and only check in a couple times for under a minute.

If you'd been expected to watch the twins and set it at 1.5\u00d7 your base, and showed up to find it was them plus their younger sibling, going to 2.5\u00d7 instead of being willing to go 1.75\u00d7 or 2\u00d7.\n\nI'm spitballing the multiplers, but the point is to make sure that what you're being paid is in line with what you're being paid for.

You have no allegiance to them. \nIf you ever work for them again - state your competitive (new) rate and set the rules - this rate is for X amount of kids.

I would have been like \"$30 times 15 kids equals $450 that you owe me. Not just $30.\" Don't ever babysit for them again and if they ask why \"cause you didn't pay me the other $420 that you owe me from last time.\" If they can change the number of kids without telling you beforehand, then you are entitled to change your fees without telling them beforehand, too.", "You should\u2019ve charged them per hour and per child.
