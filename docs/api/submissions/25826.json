(Btw they are also my next door neighbors). Earlier this morning, I received a text from the Mom (probably in her 30\u2019s). She has 3 kids with her husband (also probably in his 30\u2019s). The 2 oldest kids are twins (5F and 5M). They also have a baby (M 2-3). The text I received from the mom was her asking me if I\u2019m free for 2 hours to watch the TWINS. She said the twins and did NOT mention anyone else. I said yes and when it was time I walked next door and into their backyard where they told me to go. As I opened the gate, a mother and 2 kids walked in behind me. Weird I thought but at first shrugged it off, until I saw a bounce house blown up, and an outdoor table set with a bucket of forks, knifes, spoons, and an ice cream station. They were having a party. And wanted ME, just ME nobody else, to watch over the kids. The kids started to pile in with more and more moms with their kids. In the end, around 15 kids were there, from the ages of 1 YEAR OLD, to 6 YEARS OLD. Very young. I have babysat kids around those ages before, but 2 at a time. Not 15. I was completely shocked. And the mom was so casual about it. Not anything like, oh sorry, I forgot to mention. Nothing. When I was out of the 6 moms sight, I quickly texted my mom to vent and explain how many kids I was watching. My mom could here and see all the kids from next door. I then went back to watching the kids as they played on the bounce house, shoved each other, ate pizza, make ice cream, and keep playing. I ended up staying a bit over the time she asked as well, because not everyone was gone yet. Also, tomorrow is the first day of school. I just feel like I just waisted the last HOURS of my summer. I had no plans today, except to go to the mall and get my nails done, and I finished that before I babysat, but I would\u2019ve much rather sat on my couch while watching some tv. Instead, I watched 15 kids, and got paid 30 dollars. I don\u2019t usually care about how much or little I get paid when babysitting, but I was disappointed. I usually charge 13 dollars per hour, which my mom says isn\u2019t a lot, and whenever I tell people they say to raise my rates. I don\u2019t care, because I enjoy hanging out and watching kids. But when I charge 13 dollars an hour, that for 1-4 kids. Not 15. I get it I got paid 15 dollars an hour, but I was watching 15 kids, I was expecting more. And when I told my mom when I got home, she thought I deserved ATLEAST 50 if not more. Also, I\u2019m on my period and have cramps, it was painful to be standing for all that time that I was, and this is one of the first times I\u2019ve had cramps, I\u2019m not used to it. So I wasted the last hours of my summer, and did that in pain. The Mom asked me if I would ever do something like this again, and I said yes to be polite, but honestly, I don\u2019t ever want to babysit this family again, no matter how many kids I\u2019m babysitting. So, AITA for not wanting to babysit this family ever again?\n\nEDIT: I was not alone they were sitting on the patio but and only check in a couple times for under a minute.

You could totally tell a white lie, and say that you aren't taking babysitting jobs because you want to focus on school. You could say that what they did to you was very unfair, because it was. I'd say talk to your mom about the most appropriate way to deal with the neighbors, but don't take anymore jobs from them.

When I worked at this place, I always had 2 grown ups nearby me, but you were alone. You're a child, and babysitting so many children is hard even for adults! What if something would go wrong? It'll be your fault. And 15 dollars for so hard work? Impossible. Talk to the mom about a raise if you have to work with more children than you've been promised, or at least ask for some help. I think that'll be okay, because it's normal that a child doesn't get along with babysitting a whole kindergarten group", "If she ever asks you again, say yes, but I have to tell you, my rates have gone up.

It is a valuable life skill to be able to say no.  This is why.", "NTA. Saying no thank you is also polite. You are allowed to say no to adults, including people with children. This woman knowingly used you because she was confident she could blindside you and you would just cave in to her outrageous expectations for fear of being perceived as rude. \n\nWomen and girls are often conditioned to be people pleasers and to avoid \"causing a scene\" at all costs. This is complete bullshit.\n\nNever be afraid to speak up for yourself and learn how to say no thank you, or even just no, if you are uncomfortable with a situation or a request.

I would also state that you were really underpaid and that you deserve a lot more money for this.", "Next time the neighbors ask, feel free to say yes on the condition that they pay you $75 per hour.  If they complain, your reasoning is that you were grossly underpaid for this party.\n\nAbsolutely NTA and I feel for you OP.", "This makes me sad for you. NTA they took advantage of you and lied to you. $30 is not fair at all for 15 kids. Shame on all of those parents", "NTA.  And I am wondering why your mother did not intervene on your behalf as soon as you made her aware of the problem.  That neighbour clearly scammed you into taking care of so many children.  Don't ever babysit for her again and if she asks, tell her the truth as to why, because she needs to know that you are well aware that she is an AH.  Personally, I would have left immediately when I realised that she deceived me into agreeing to babysit two children and left me with 15.", "NTA\n\nOnce you told your Mom the situation, she should've had words with the neighbor and got you out of there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And if you do have to bump it up more for the unexpected, don't be afraid to push for more than you would have had they been upfront. eg. If you'd been expected to watch the twins and set it at 1.5\u00d7 your base, and showed up to find it was them plus their younger sibling, going to 2.5\u00d7 instead of being willing to go 1.75\u00d7 or 2\u00d7.\n\nI'm spitballing the multiplers, but the point is to make sure that what you're being paid is in line with what you're being paid for. And a little bit of penalizing parents that are trying to pull a fast one on you when needed.\n\nIn your situation here, you could have easily said $20 an hour per mom ($120 - $140 per hour) and still been lowballing it.\n\nHeck, if you'd been given the real details in advance, you'd have been perfectly justifed in asking for $200/hr with the agreement that you could recruit a friend to help you (and split the pay with).\n\nSide-note, if parents do lie to you in advance and refuse to pony up more when you find out and tell them it will cost more, leave. Decline because they were not upfront and are unwilling to pay the increased rate that entails. They'll either blink and pay up or they won't. But no matter what, they'll learn not to play games with you again.", "In the future, if a family outright lies to you like that, just walk out.

A trustworthy   reliable sitter is worth their weight in gold and parents will pay good money for that sitter. \n\nRaise your rates.", "Never go less than $20 (for 2 kids)", "Me too", "Yep. I used to babysit groups of kids when the parents were on scene, but I always knew ahead of time what the gig was. I also had a sumner school class on babysitting and learned a lot from it. One point I still recall is getting your parents involved if you\u2019re unsure about anything - the family, the gig, etc."]}
