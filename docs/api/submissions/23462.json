{"id": 23462, "submission_id": "15d9m62", "title": "AITA for insisting that my teenage son spend Saturdays with us?", "selftext": "My (41F) husband (43M) and I have a very blended family. I have a 16-year-old son, Brian, with my ex-husband (we divorced when Brian was 5 and have reasonable visitation, meaning we don't have a set schedule for Brian to see his father). My husband has a 6-year-old daughter from his previous marriage, who spends the weekends with us. We also have two children together; a 4-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.\n\nDue to all our schedules, weekends are really the only days where we can spend time together as a family, which my husband and I believe is important. My husband and I have set aside Saturdays as our \"Family Day\" where we do various activities (go to the park, see a movie, etc.). Each week, the kids take turns choosing the activities we do.\n\nBrian always complains about our family days, especially when it's his turn to choose the activity. He doesn't like the fact that he must choose activities that are age appropriate for the other kids. His complaining has gotten worse as he's gotten older. I do agree that the age difference limits the activities he can choose (i.e. we can only see movies with a G or PG rating) but I nonetheless feel that these days are important for bonding as a family. Brian says these days are stupid, and that he'd rather spend time with his friends, go over to his dad's house, or even do homework (school's out for the summer but during the school year he often complains that these family days, combined with church on Sundays, leaves him very little time to finish his homework, and I've told him that learning how to balance work and leisure is part of life).\n\nToday was Brian's day to choose the activity. There was a concert that he wanted to go to with his friends, but I insisted that he spend the day with us (I wasn't comfortable with him going to the concert anyway because it's a metal band and those concerts can get pretty wild, plus he would be home past curfew). We ended up going to the movies. Brian asked if we could at least see Haunted Mansion, since it is a Disney film, however, it wouldn't be appropriate for the other kids as it's PG-13. We ended up seeing Elemental. Brian had his earphones in the entire time, and didn't watch the movie.\n\nWhen we got home, Brian announced that this is the last time he will be joining us for Family Day, and from now on he'll be spending Saturdays with his dad, as he's able to do more activities that are geared toward kids his age, since his dad doesn't have any other kids. He's already spoken to his dad, who has said that he's \"100% on board\" with this, as it will mean that he gets to see Brian more often. While I encourage Brian to spend more time with his father, I still feel like these family days are important, and my husband agrees. The other day my younger son asked me why his brother doesn't like him, which broke my heart!\n\nSo, AITA? Should I continue to insist that Brian continue to participate in our family days?", "created_utc": 1690683307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d9m62/aita_for_insisting_that_my_teenage_son_spend/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One day a month might be more appropriate. You aren't fostering togetherness, just resentment.", "YTA. Every Saturday? You think a teenager wants to spend every single weekend with his mother and kid siblings when he could be hanging out with his friends. \n\nIt's time to let go. Your son is his own person.", "YTA. You\u2019re expecting too much from the 16yo. Have an hour every weekend for games but expecting a 16 yo to give up their weekend to play games and do things that are appropriate for a 2yo is wrong. You created a family that is very separated in age. It\u2019s not appropriate to tell your 16 yo he can\u2019t do age appropriate things on the weekend bc it has to be appropriate for a 2yo.", "YTA no teenager wants to spend a weekend night with his mom and siblings >10 years younger than them. Time to let go of the cord and let him do him. He\u2019s not bonding when he\u2019s hating and resenting every single minute. You could\u2019ve compromised and done things appropriate for your older child while your husband cares for the younger ones, you\u2019ve opted to not and now he\u2019s opting to spend less time with you.", "YTA. Ever consider that you need to stop focusing so much on the younger kids and do something that's geared towards Brian? He shouldn't always have to put aside what he wants to do just to satisfy his younger siblings. That's unfair and you know it.", "YTA. You're treating your son like he's six, not sixteen. And your comment is so over the top. You really told him he needs to learn how to *balance work and leisure* when his down time consists of playing games with the family or whatever excursion you plan and going to church. You are something special. Not in a good way.", "YTA. Balance leisure and work? Between school, family day, and church - what leisure? I\u2019m proud of Brian and if I was him I\u2019d stay all weekend at dads. You are in for a rude awakening because Brian\u2019s about to rebel against you. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t my brother like me\u201d because you force him to do childish things even on his days to choose. Ridiculous", "YTA he\u2019s 16 being forced to do kid things. The more you force it the less he will spend time. Forced bonding is not the way to bond. \n\nAs for the younger kids you just tell them he loves them but he\u2019s older and busier. Let eldest develop relationships with his younger siblings when he chooses to instead of forced days.\n\nAnd frankly how about you spend time with your son just you both doing things he likes to do? Perhaps if you bothered to get to know him one on one doing his activities he\u2019d be less annoyed about being forced to see kids films.", "YTA. In order to have a family day, the entire family has to WANT to be involved. You can organize a family day, but you can't force a family day. Nothing is worse than being forced to be somewhere that you are not legally required to be at.", "YTA. He should do whatever he wants. Don't control what a 16yr boy does on his weekend. Or he will hate you the whole weekend anyways. You are forcing him not to just not be able to hangout with his friends on the most easy day for them to hangout, in his most crucial years. But you are also forcing him to do things he doesn't want. You give him the illusion of choice, I don't blame him for putting in his earphones. \n\nI am so happy he stood up for himself and told you he won't. I am glad he will hangout with his dad who will allow him to have a more fun time, and allow him to not spend 1/2 of the days he has fully to himself doing something he hates.\n\nHe goes to school 5 days a week, and the 2 days to rest isn't enough. With you he only had 1. He most likely would have rather been at school with his friends otherwise.", "YTA let your boy do what he wants.  He's gonna remember and resent you for what you're doing.  You're pushing your son away at the time when you COULD be being a great ally to him because you're selfish.  20 years later you're probably gonna act like you have no idea why he has zero interest in spending time with you.", "YTA. He is 16. In two years he will likely be on his own in college. He needs to have time to spend with his friends and get some independence. My daughter is almost 16. Some weekends she wants to hang with friends and I never say no, unless of course we had previous plans like a concert or some non-refundable. Today we went to movies as a family. But we asked her multiple times if she would prefer to go to this movie with friends and told her it was completely okay to do so. She chose not to and spend the time with us. But if you hold on and insist he spend every r Saturday with you and doing things he has no interest in doing, once he leaves your house, I doubt he will visit on weekends. By forcing him to have family time that you insist is important for bonding, you aren actually doing the opposite: you are pushing him away.", "YTA. Are you so blind?? Your son is 16! Of course your husband agrees with you because he\u2019s an AH too!! You\u2019re forcing this kid to play daycare with you because you don\u2019t understand that he has different needs then a 2, 4 and 6 year old. Get over yourselves and give the appropriate attention and assist with the needs of Your 16 year old. Also quit feeling so empathetic for the child who asks why his older sibling doesn\u2019t like/love him. How \u2018bout having a \u2018broken heart\u2019 for the child your forcing into these Family Saturdays???", "YTA so your older son never gets to do something he enjoys, and you're building his resentment to you and his siblings. That does not bode well for your relationship.", "YTA - he\u2019s 16 let him do age appropriate activities!  In a couple of years he will be an adult and if your not careful he\u2019ll just go no contact.\n\nYou are effectively using his whole weekend with \u201cfamily days\u201d that are totally age inappropriate for him and then church on Sunday\u2019s.\n\nSurely church would be considered a family activity if you are all attending.\n\nApologise to your son, maybe talk to him about activities you can do just with him.  Maybe you can grow a relationship with him where he enjoys spending time with you.", "Every Saturday you make your son do things he doesn\u2019t want to do and aren\u2019t interesting to kids his age. Easy YTA. Totally normally to have family days, but every Saturday is ridiculous especially considering every time it\u2019s an unappealing activity. You should encourage him to go to his dads more because he actually wants to give him the opportunity to explore his interests!", "Listen. I get where you're coming from. I do, and family *is* important. But as someone who has several *much* younger siblings, this isn't going to work. You're just going to make Brian resent his younger siblings. If you can find something he *likes* doing with them, great. But forcing him to do things every Saturday that are appropriate for a 4 year old is not helping (It's also not 'leisure' because he doesn't want to do it).\n\nYTA. Listen to your kid, and find a different way to help him bond with the young'uns.", "YTA. While I can see that you cherish and value the time your family spends together, nothing will make your teenage son hate it more than being forced to spend time doing something he doesn't want. It's already unfair that he has to curb his own interests for the sake of the younger ones. Why should he care about it if he can't really enjoy himself?", "YTA. Teenagers want to spend time with their friends - however - he might like it if you hired a babysitter for the little ones and went someplace with only him or maybe him and a friend, doing something he likes. Does he get to invite his friends over to your place? Does he have a bedroom of his own at your place?", "Yep. YTA. \n\nYou want a teenager to spend every Saturday with his family instead of with his friends, a family which includes a bunch of little kids. \n\nWhen you were 16 would you have wanted to spend every Saturday with your parents and two toddlers? What sane 16 year old would want to do that? \n\nOn top of that, even when he gets a small amount of input re: family activities, he doesn\u2019t really because he has to choose something kid friendly. Again, what teenager would want to do that? \n\nYou\u2019re lucky he\u2019s been willing to go along with it for as long as he has. If one of my parents had tried to stop me from going to a concert when I was his age, I would\u2019ve gone anyway and taken the punishment when I got back. Particularly if I\u2019d been expected to give up every single Saturday before that for \u201cfamily night.\u201d \n\nYou chose to get remarried and have additional kids, which is fine. That\u2019s your business. Your eldest didn\u2019t choose to have young siblings, though, and no amount of forced family bonding time is going to change that. \n\nObviously if he has the option he\u2019s no longer going to participate. This whole thing is just bad parenting from start to finish. You\u2019re ignoring the fact that he\u2019s a teenager and you\u2019re trying to force a bond, which isn\u2019t how that works. \n\nUnless you want him to move to his dad\u2019s permanently and grow even more resentment towards you and your new family, you\u2019ll back off.", "YTA. Family time should be measured in quality, not quantity. What\u2019s the point of forcing your son to be with your household when he\u2019s clearly not enjoying your time together? This was your chance to bond with him and make nice family memories and you blew it. You could have been flexible about letting him choose the Saturday activities, but now you\u2019ve created the feeling like spending time with you all is a chore and an obligation. It won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s an adult. Watch how much you won\u2019t be seeing him then.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with spending some quality time as a family, but if you're continually forcing your teenage son into spending time doing activities he does not enjoy  you're going to foster more resentment than bonding.\n\n Instead of making him spend the whole day with you, why not have a nice, sit down breakfast or brunch with the whole family before letting your older son enjoy his day doing something with his friends. Or have family dinners one night a week. Or a game night. A few hours of family fun might be more palatable for a sixteen year old than an entire day,", "YTA jesus every single saturday he's basically forced to hang out with kids just so you can pretend happy families while he's hating every second and the resentment is building, does he ever actually get to go out with his friends", "Yes absolutely", "YTA\n\nYou cannot force a relationship or connection if Brian is unwilling. All you are doing is building resentment and anger, and will likely end with him going NC with your family eventually.\n\nI agree it's sad for your other children, but clearly your son likely still has issues over your divorce and his father. I'd definitely recommend some counseling", "YTA. You guys mean well but it\u2019s his weekend too. He goes to school all week, you\u2019re asking him to eat up his entire Saturday on activities he has said over and over again that he doesn\u2019t want to do, and church on Sunday. That\u2019s pretty ridiculous, come on. Why can\u2019t family day be once a month? Why don\u2019t you do an activity for just Brian once in a while? He should get solo time anyway, and you should take an interest in his interests. Set aside a day every now and then where you go out and do something he wants with him and a friend or just the two of you, or the adults and Brian. I\u2019m kind of surprised that you don\u2019t see the issue here. Ironically \u201cfamily day\u201d is basically entirely excluding him by being geared toward everyone else.", "YTA. Brian is NOT getting to choose an activity. He has to pick which little kid activity he hates least. You made him miss a fun concert to go to a movie he didn\u2019t want to see, with kids too young to realistically even sit still through it, and continue to take away every Saturday. I\u2019m surprised it took more than 2 weeks for him to go to Dad\u2019s. You\u2019re confusing quantity with quality here. YOU are the reason his siblings feel like he doesn\u2019t like them. Sweet moments of him letting them play a video game with him, reading to them, chasing them down the hall, etc. are the real bonding moments. Forcing him to sit through a movie with toddlers isn\u2019t. You are building tons of resentment and pushing them further apart.", "yta. Op became a typical conservative church goer cause of her new man and is  surprised her kids don't wanna spend time with her lmao  \nnot gonna be surprised if he begs his dad for full custody. the delusional is wild today lol", "YTA - you are already losing him by pressuring him into doing things he doesn\u2019t want. You are actively driving him away instead of bringing him closer. He sounds neglected in this whole forced family dynamic you have created.", "YTA that\u2019s ridiculous.", "YTA - Your son complained that he couldn\u2019t choose an activity that he enjoyed and instead of compromising so he could enjoy family day too, you ignore him.", "YTA and you\u2019re going to sacrifice your future relationship with your son in order to get these Family Days now. He is in a crucial stage of development here, time with his friends is really important. If you force togetherness he\u2019s going to push back and resent you.", "This is actually ridiculous! YTA", "yta - your son is 16 and you all treat him like your toddlers.  do u even spend any time alone with him getting to know what his interests are? probably not ur too busy accommading your husband your toddlers.   your 16 yr old son has a right to spend more time with his father and do things of young adults his age.   if you continue this path when he is 18 you can bet he will be gone and go no contact.", "YTA. He's 16, not 6.", "YTA - Me and my brothers have a decade plus age gap. Rather like your kids but a bit less extreme. The thing that's important for your kids to bond and spend time is they have to want to spend time. You pushing him to do things that aren't age appropriate and frustrating him is going to actively prohibit the kids to bond. You need to encourage him to find ways to bond and spend time with his siblings but requiring him to do so isn't going to work. \n\nI also think its important to point out that your 16 year old son is almost an adult. You need to start thinking of him in those terms not as a little kid like your other children.", "YTA - if you want family time, make it the same day as church or something and let your teenager be a teenager for pete\u2019s sake.", "YTA- your son is 16 years old. You literally pushed him away by forcing him to partake in your family days just so you can feel better about yourself as a parent. \n\nHe\u2019s at an age where socializing with friends is important. Do you know how many kids are now unalive because they couldn\u2019t socialize and go to school during covid? \n\nHe wanted to go to a concert and if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable the. You could have dropped him off and picked him up. You also shouldn\u2019t judge metal concerts. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want you to activities that 2 and 4 year olds do. \n\nDo you ever just spend time with Brian alone? Doing what he wants to do? If not, maybe you should start. You have from now till he graduates high school. Then he\u2019s gone.", "Metal concerts don't get that wild lmao you can stand to the side. Death metal and black metal bands rarely even have mosh pits. Most people are just jamming together. Crowd killing at hardcore shows is a whole other thing, and I wish they would stop.", "YTA.\n\nWhy does it have to be a whole day? And if it is to be a whole day, why is it every week? Why not once per month?\n\n>There was a concert that he wanted to go to with his friends, but I insisted that he spend the day with us\n\nThat's mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I nonetheless feel that these days are important for bonding as a family. Brian says these days are stupid\n\nYou're wrong, and he is right. If you're already dragging him to church on a sunday, make that your family day. Forcing him to hangout with far younger siblings, and engage in mind-numbing stuff for toddlers is no way to get him to bond with them. He's going to resent you, and them. Encourage him to play with them, lego, sand pit, board games, art, creative stuff like that, for no more than one hour per week, and call that the family time. Don't make him watch kids films with them, that's a shitty way to treat a teen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I've told him that learning how to balance work and leisure is part of life\n\nHow is he supposed to find balance when you're taking up his entire saturday AND dragging him to church on a sunday? When is he supposed to have time for the stuff he enjoys, and building friendships?", "YTA.", "I think continuing to insist that Brian join you for Family Day will be a waste of your time and will just make Brian resentful. He does have a point if he was at his Dad\u2019s he would spend time with his friends which is what teenagers want to do. You can\u2019t force him to feel family. YTA", "Yta.  He even told you he doesn't have time to finish homework when he's with you.  \n\nGlad he's staying at his dad's.\n\n Your other son asking why his older brother doesn't like him sounds like you trash talk your older son to your other kids or they overhead something.", "YTA. This sounds like hell.", "Well, at this point I hope it\u2019s clear to you that completely unambiguously YTA.\n\nI hope you cherish those fond memories (of bickering and misery) when\u2014between \u201cfamily days\u201d and I\u2019m guessing forced church attendance\u2014Brian quite understandably goes NC on you at the first available moment.", "YTA.  Your idea of \u201cFamily Day\u201d is Brian having to cater to the younger kids all day every single Saturday.  It\u2019s a joke to say that he gets to pick the activity when it has to be age appropriate for a six year old, four year old and two year old.  You really think a 16 year-old will enjoy an \u201cage-appropriate\u201d activity for elementary school children?  And if he spends his entire Saturday in forced family bonding, and Sunday going to church and trying to finish his homework in what little free time he has left, when does Brian get to do what he actually wants to do?  You are just going to drive him away and make him resent his siblings if you always put their needs ahead of his.  Why don\u2019t you consider making family day once a month?  Or at least stop dangling the illusion of choice in front of him if you are going to insist that every activity has to be okay for a two year-old.", "YTA.  He's a teenager.  Spending half his weekend with his parents and much younger siblings is a big ask.  You can incorporate family time in smaller doses... family game night, dinner together, etc.  If you keep insisting on this big block of time every week, you're going to lose ANY time with the siblings.", "YTA- But your time is coming soon... In a couple of years he will no longer be underage and it's likely he'll want to do all those things he was not allowed to do because \"family\". \nWhen a 16 y/o wants to do homework more than a social activity you know the issue is serious. \nAlso, he's already complaining about not having enough time for school activities... It sounds like he's being forced, and that's coming from your narrative, I can only imagine his version of this situation.", "YTA. You're doing nothing more than creating resentment under the guise of family bonding.  Keep it up, and not only will your son spend more and more time with his father. He'll cut the lot of you off when he turns 18.", "YTA you want to force a 16 yo boy to sit through activities for pre primary school aged kids once a week for the sake of togetherness? A weekly family dinner, maybe, but not on a Saturday night. But a whole day on his weekend? jeez.. \n\nI'd have jumped out the window and disappeared every Saturday before anyone woke up. Thank god hes got his dads to run to.", "YTA. It\u2019s \u2018your day\u2019 but you must pick an activity like you\u2019re a 2 year old, and do so with bells on and a chipper all in attitude. \n\nI understand you wanting to spend time with all of your family together, but this way clearly isn\u2019t THE WAY.", "YTA\n\nHe is 16 years old which means he is going to want his own independence and rightfully so. He\u2019s at an age where he wants to go out with his friends and have fun. These activists aren\u2019t fun for him because of what you are requiring. What is the point of him getting to choose what the activity will be if you don\u2019t allow it to be suitable for him aswell. A concert at his age is 100% acceptable as most teenagers are going to them when they are 14 and I understand the worry of a concert this type but he is not the age of the other kids in your household, he is maturing and you shouldn\u2019t berate him for it. I do feel like you are neglecting his needs and wants in replacement for your other children because of how different you have reacted to him saying how he feels compared to your reaction on how your other child feels. You are also neglecting his education as you\u2019ve mentioned that he isn\u2019t able to complete all his homework due to the fact you think that these activities are more beneficial.", "Yta - Why are your new children\u2019s needs more important than your eldest ?\n \nForcing a teenage boy to give up his weekends to cater to your new kids all the time is unreasonable . \n\nYour son has picked up on the favoritism.\n\nEven now when he\u2019s chosen to stop spending time with you , you\u2019re more concerned that your younger kids feelings are hurt .\n\nI\u2019m glad your son at least has his father in his life , who actually seems to give a shit about him.", "YTA and honestly, you\u2019ve already lost him. He already resents you, and his baby siblings. 8 weekend days per month where 7 are geared towards toddlers or Jesus, and then \u201chis\u201d is ALSO geared towards toddlers\u2026? I suggest you reflect, then genuinely apologize for absolutely ignoring his needs.", "Yta, you should not, all you\u2019re going to do is end up in court with your ex in a custody battle because your son absolutely refuses to come see you. And unless there\u2019s proof his dads an unfit custodian it\u2019s unlikely at his age the court will side with you. Also regardless of what your husband thinks your son should do his opinion is meaningless and isn\u2019t relevant to the situation at all. This is between you, your ex and your son. Your son who\u2019s more than old enough to have his own opinion has made it clear what he wants and his dad supports him. Regardless of your morals and beliefs he\u2019s coming into his own and you can\u2019t force them on him like you think you can. Once they\u2019re old enough to start making choices of their own even when you force something like you are now you can\u2019t make your kid believe it or agree. You\u2019re not the sole influence in his life and you can\u2019t make him agree with everything you believe is important", "YTA\n\n> and I've told him that learning how to balance work and leisure is part of life\n\nWhat leisure?\n\nYour son has school during the week -> work\nYour son has to spend his saturdays doing what you want -> a task therefore work (everything you have to do w/o wanting to do it is definitly NOT leisure)\nYour son needs to go to church on sunday morning -> a task therefore work\nYour son has to use sunday noon to finish schoolwork -> work\n\nSo again, what leisure time are you talking about? And now you are pissed your son wants a little bit of control over what should be his leisure time? \n\nYou need to understand that you can make your kids do stuff as a parent, but you can't force them to enjoy it. If not all of your kids enjoy it, there will be no bonding anyway. \n\nLimit family time with all members to one sunday afternoon a month, maybe this way also your son will actually enjoy it and bond with his siblings.", "YTA. Your son asked why his brother doesn't like him and the answer is you. You're trying to force it and it's never going to work. He's 16, give him the space to bond with his siblings in his own way, and stop telling him it's his choice what to do when it's not.", "YTA, but not a huge one. \n\nThe kid wants to have some time to do 16-year old shit. He was even considerate enough to ask for Haunted Mansion instead of something actual more mature. You take away his Saturday and a bunch of his Sunday. Are you willing to compromise church so he can have one full day?", "You are not an AH, but EVERY Saturday is TOO much to expect a teenager to spend all day doing little kid activities.  You have 3 that are little, they likely enjoy the same things.  I don't blame the kid one bit for not wanting to do EVERY Saturday, especially having been forced after voicing how much he hates it and never getting to do what he wants.  Stop making him go every weekend, once a month is enough.", "I would not say you\u2019re an AH - but perhaps unreasonable.\n\nHe\u2019s a teenager, he wants to do his own thing with his friends, not be saddled for the for day having to do little kid things.\n\nWhich is completely age appropriate.\n\nBy forcing him, you will probably end up creating resentment from him against you and the young kids.\n\nYou need to accept the fact that teenagers and small children, just are not going to want to do the same things and stop forcing him to do this stuff.\n\nThey\u2019re not \u201cbonding\u201d, he\u2019ll end up hating them and you.", "NTA win stupid games play stupid prizes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a 16-year-old son, Brian, with my ex-husband (we divorced when Brian was 5 and have reasonable visitation, meaning we don't have a set schedule for Brian to see his father). My husband has a 6-year-old daughter from his previous marriage, who spends the weekends with us. We also have two children together; a 4-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.\n\nDue to all our schedules, weekends are really the only days where we can spend time together as a family, which my husband and I believe is important. My husband and I have set aside Saturdays as our \"Family Day\" where we do various activities (go to the park, see a movie, etc.). Each week, the kids take turns choosing the activities we do.\n\nBrian always complains about our family days, especially when it's his turn to choose the activity. He doesn't like the fact that he must choose activities that are age appropriate for the other kids. His complaining has gotten worse as he's gotten older. I do agree that the age difference limits the activities he can choose (i.e. we can only see movies with a G or PG rating) but I nonetheless feel that these days are important for bonding as a family. Brian says these days are stupid, and that he'd rather spend time with his friends, go over to his dad's house, or even do homework (school's out for the summer but during the school year he often complains that these family days, combined with church on Sundays, leaves him very little time to finish his homework, and I've told him that learning how to balance work and leisure is part of life).\n\nToday was Brian's day to choose the activity. There was a concert that he wanted to go to with his friends, but I insisted that he spend the day with us (I wasn't comfortable with him going to the concert anyway because it's a metal band and those concerts can get pretty wild, plus he would be home past curfew). We ended up going to the movies. Brian asked if we could at least see Haunted Mansion, since it is a Disney film, however, it wouldn't be appropriate for the other kids as it's PG-13. We ended up seeing Elemental. Brian had his earphones in the entire time, and didn't watch the movie.\n\nWhen we got home, Brian announced that this is the last time he will be joining us for Family Day, and from now on he'll be spending Saturdays with his dad, as he's able to do more activities that are geared toward kids his age, since his dad doesn't have any other kids. He's already spoken to his dad, who has said that he's \"100% on board\" with this, as it will mean that he gets to see Brian more often. While I encourage Brian to spend more time with his father, I still feel like these family days are important, and my husband agrees. The other day my younger son asked me why his brother doesn't like him, which broke my heart!\n\nSo, AITA? Should I continue to insist that Brian continue to participate in our family days?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It what world would a 15 year old enjoy being a toddler, REPEATEDLY?? You should\u2019ve been choosing to have family day with just you and him so he could see that YOU actually care about him.", "YTA. You have 2 years to make or break your relationship with an adult son. Choose wisely.", "YTA. You're asking a teenager to spend the entire day every Saturday with preschoolers, after he's told you how he feels about that and has offered some compromises? Of course he's going to look for ways around that. Try reducing it to an hour or two on Saturday morning, or one Saturday a month or something.", "YTA. Each age group bonds differently. Do you really think forced bonding is going to achieve your goal?\n\nYou need to stop being stubborn. Your son is on the first step to permanently remove himself from your family. And you.", "YTA. He's 16. It's totally natural that he wants to spend his weekend with his mates and so he should. He should be off having his own adventures, seeing bands ( ofc curfews can be altered for one night ) and living his life.\n\nYou do need to stop with the guilt too and start telling the 4 year old that a 16 year old not wanting to do family time anymore is nothing to do with him not liking him! They are at different stages of their lives and should be doing different things now. Don't stop your eldest living his life. Family dynamics change as kids get older.", "YTA you are fostering resentment, let him be a teenager. Can\u2019t family time be Sunday dinner or something?", "YTA, and you aren't bonding with anyone, you're making your son resent you, your husband, and all those little kids. He's made this perfectly clear, and you refuse to see it.", "YTA.  Saturday is the most likely day he\u2019d do something with friends and your making him miss it to do little kid stuff.  It would be better to pick an activity after church or a game night during the week, or a family day once a month.  Make it quality time over quantity.  Right now it\u2019s not quality time it\u2019s a little kids fun day that he has to attend and miss out on activities for his group.  He\u2019s not a little kid and deserves time to do teenager stuff.  If you keep ignoring his wants and opinion then he\u2019ll be at Dad\u2019s 100% of the time.", "YTA and you're basically ensuring that the minute he gets the chance and has the financial means to run for the hills, he will. Forcing him to participate now is something you can do I guess but you're seriously damaging your long term relationship with your son. May wanna rethink this, OP.", "YTA. You expect a 16 year old kid to spend every Saturday doing things a 2 year old finds enjoyable? Even on days he gets to \u201cpick\u201d? Why pretend he gets to pick anything? There are absolutely no common interests between a 2 year old and a 16 year old. Brian is right, this is stupid.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re making him hate family life. Keep this up and expect to never see him again once he\u2019s old enough to move out. You\u2019re making his life miserable. \n\nYou\u2019re on the path to permanently losing your son. Please fix this before it\u2019s too late. \n\nThis is the beginning of him not wanting to spend time with you.", "I feel like you've posted this, under a different account. Way too similar.  \n\nYTA was my vote then, and it sticks now.  You need to loosen the reigns as they age not tighten them.  Of course a 16yo isn't interested in Elementals.  Or in spending every Saturday at home instead of with friends. \n\nBut you went restrictive and now he'll be gone every Saturday to the parents' house, who understands he's getting older and needs some freedom.", "YTA\nDon't make your son weird to his friends and school mates. You're causing psychological damage that will last his whole life.", "YTA.  He\u2019s 16!  Saturday is the best day for him to hang out with his friends and is also a completely normal thing for him to be doing.  The only thing you are accomplishing by forcing him to do this is creating resentment.", "YTA", "Good for your son for speaking up and putting his foot down. He's definitely old enough to choose which parent to spend his time with. Since you constantly prioritize everyone but him, it's no wonder he wants to spend Saturdays elsewhere.\n\nYTA", "Sorry further YTA comment. You're not teaching him to balance work and leisure time. To a 16yo, doing childish activities would be work. He basically isn't getting leisure time on weekends at all. Honestly he'll definitely grow to resent you for this. He needs space and his own life. He's becoming an adult. This is completely unfair on him.", "YTA. Leave the kid alone, he\u2019ll grow to resent you for it.", "Yes. Yta for insisting your kid be dragged to small children activities so that you - the adult - can feel togetherness with your children in one place. Get to know your kid for who he is now, you find time to do activities with him 1 on 1 so you can get to know him and encourage him to include himself with a family dinner at home. \nThe other kids are gaining nothing with a bored and resentful teenager. The teenager is gaining nothing but more resentment. \nFind a different way to feel better about yourself and your parenting without damaging the relationship with one kid. \nIt\u2019s not too late to fix your relationship, but it is too late for you to keep demanding he come along to every little kid event you have setup for little kids.", "YTA. I *hate* when people get divorced and make a life for themselves and then stuff kids into it like they don\u2019t have feelings.  **He doesn\u2019t want to spend time with you.**  You and your husband have a family and *you* are living your best life.  **Let him live the life he wants to live too.**\n\nI swear, this is some selfish-ass shit.  **He gets to choose if he wants to spend time with a man you married and kids you had\u2014of your own volition.**", "YTA Forcing your teenager to spend every Saturday going to kiddie movies he hates is the worst possible way to have quality time with your son.\nAlso Haunted Mansion was probably not that bad for kids even of it's PG13.", "YTA Sometimes it's better to be benevolently absent than angrily present. \n\nYour younger children will probably do better when the answer to where is Brian is:\n\n \"oh he's spending time with his Dad\" or \"he's doing homework\" or even \"he's doing big boy things with other big boys\" than \"Oh he's right there visibly resenting all of you\". That's probably why your son asked that question. \n\nSaturday is an important day for anyone.\n\nKeep forcing him to be with you and he won't when you can't.", "Poor Brian. YTA.", "Yes YTA. When does he ever get to do something he wants to do? It's all about you, hubs and younger kids. I'm glad Brian has somewhere else to go to get away from you.", "YTA you should go on that show smothered, EVERY Saturday?!? Holy crap I woulda killed my mom lol she woulda killed me! If it's not quality family time it's not worth it, and it's not quality time because he's miserable.", "YTA. You are not showing your teenager that you value him at all.  He is being forced to do things that the younger kids like and you never do anything that is age appropriate for him. You have basically shown him that he has been replaced by new siblings.  \n\nIf you want a relationship with him you need to immediately apologize, let him have time with his friends and prioritize him \u2014 do something with him just the two of you.", "YTA. He is 16, and it's only natural that he wants to spend time doing his own thing. You are already going to church on Sundays as a family, so I don't understand why you don't extend that to make that the family day. He can do his own thing on a Saturday.", "YTA. So you're already forcing him to spend the whole day with you every Saturday, but then when you tell him he can pick the activity, you also veto that freedom as well. It's one PG-13 movie. You're other kids will be fine.", "YTA and more than a little controlling. \n\nHe's 16. He could have gone to a different movie, one suitable for his age, and met back up with you afterward. He should have been able to attend the concert. He should not be forced to tag along on events focused on toddlers. \n\nIs he attending church voluntarily, or are you forcing that as well? Do you ever do ANYTHING based on what HE would enjoy, even if it means leaving out the three littles? Do you make him babysit them?\n\nI don't blame him for deciding to avoid \"family\" days where he is ignored. I wouldn't be surprised if he decides he wants to live with his dad full-time. Or to see you on here again in 4 years complaining how your son doesn't want anything to do with you or your new family.", "If you didn't continue to force him into this Saturday thing when he communicated to you over and over that he was unhappy, this wouldn't have happened. At least he will only be with his dad and hasn't gone off to an unsafe place. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHe\u2019s having to cater his weekend to his siblings because things need to be age appropriate. Why even give him a day to decide what family activity to do when it\u2019s not really anything he wants to do? Why make him spend the mental energy just to be told that it needs to be age appropriate for little kids? \n\nSo every Saturday he has to spend with you doing activities that aren\u2019t of interest to him and it seems like he doesn\u2019t get to do activities he enjoys with you guys. Then Sunday he has church, so when does this kid get a weekend or time to do what he enjoys or hang with his friends? \n\nYou are going to make him resent you (seems he already does) and you forcing him to spend every weekend with the family is excessive. Why would he want to hang every weekend with you when it seems him and what he wants to do is never taken into account? Why is he the one who always has to make sacrifices and compromises ?", "My mum used to force me to see her every single weekend up until I was in my late teens. I wasn't allowed to switch days with her or skip anything if I wanted to be with my friends bc I was \"choosing my friends over her\".\n\nI'm 40 now and I haven't seen her for nearly 10 years.\n\nYTA", "YTA for forcing 16 to choose activities suitable for 2, 4 and 6 rather than getting a sitter sometimes and letting him choose age appropriate activiland. How much fun do you think baby activities are for him?\n\nSunday should be family day since you go to church anyway. Church and brunch are enough at 16. \n\nHe needs time with friends, not just doing baby activities.\n\nGood that he's spending time with his dad; he may choose to live w dad to escape baby land.", "YTA, he's going to see it as forced and resent you for it. \n\nWhy can't Sunday be family day after church? You're taking up his whole weekend and leaving him no time at all to be a teenager!", "YTA my boys are 13 and 11 years older than their sister.  I never thought of trying to force what you are. Guess what? 18 is right around the corner and bye. Never see you again.", "This. Once a month might even be pushing it.\n\nOP, YTA. I have a 17-yo son and an 11-yo daughter. We learned several years ago that the age gap makes family activities difficult, which means they're not fun for anyone. \n\nI also agree with the comment that you shouldn't make Brian accommodate the younger kids. Why can't you just spend time with Brian doing what he wants once in a while? \n\nAlso, you should have let him see the metal band. He's 16, not 12.", "I can't believe OP actually typed out \"these days are important for bonding as a family,\" continued with the rest of the post, and failed to see just how wrong that reasoning is. No bonding is happening!", "This! Was going to suggest she talk to her son and say \u20183 weekends are yours, but 1 weekend is for all of us\u2019 and actually make the family day inclusive.", "Also, you can\u2019t force people to be a family. He\u2019s sixteen. He\u2019s nowhere near the age of the younger kids. He\u2019s not interested in doing activities picked by a four year old all day Saturday. Or a two or six year old.", "And church is apparently required every Sunday. Kid gets zero weekend days.", "Not to mention he never gets to do anything age appropriate. Ridiculous!", "And OP *knows it*.  You are damn right she knows it.", "It's favoritism and I guarantee it is obvious to the teenager that his wants and needs are unimportant.", "Ya, OP when do you expect your son to have any downtime? I\u2019m genuinely curious.", ">he often complains that these family days, combined with church on Sundays, leaves him very little time to finish his homework\n\nI guess he doesn't get to do much on Sundays, either. It's 5 days of school, 1 'family day' and 1 'church day.' Plus finding time to do homework.", "OP doesn\u2019t mean well, though, and she *does* see the issue.  She just doesn\u2019t care bc what she wants is family time, whether he wants it or not.  Who would actually force a 16 year old to engage in family time geared toward his younger half-siblings and a kid who is in no way related to him whatsoever?\n\nAnd who could be oblivious enough to not see she is being toxic in doing so?  No one.  She knows.", "My son is 17 and is off on his first gig this year. Muse at the 02 in London. Even with rules on his first one (seated not standing), I'm still nervous but he has to go and make these memories.", "Nope, she\u2019s the AH.", "I agree. Soft AH vote from me, but don't try and control the guy so much, he's 16. By the time he's 18, you'll be lucky to see him at all if you're going to be this controlling. Be careful, Mom, you're going to push him away faster with this kind of stuff.", "You\u2019ve confused me on this one. Who played stupid games to win stupid prizes?", "I have the same age gap for my kids. It was very difficult to cater to both at the same time. So we didn\u2019t. We took turns and did more 1-on-1 stuff for a while. Now that they are a bit older than yours, they actually have a lot in common and get along well and want to do similar activities, and spend time together which I\u2019m so happy about.", "My sister and I have about a seven-year age gap between us, and we were never on the same page. Thankfully my parents understood this aspect.\n\nOP's oldest son is at the age where he's not into kiddie activities anymore and shouldn't be forced into doing them.", "Yeah, forced bonding, just screams lasting moments.", "Chances are that kid is gonna let super loose once he hits college and can suddenly decide over his own time.", "Exactly. When are the age appropriate activities for Brian, OP??", "When he\u2019s 18 and is no longer legally obligated to go over there /s", "I overlooked that, making this even worse for the kid...\n\nHe has literally 0 days fully to himself, I would get burnt out that way. I feel so bad for the kid.", "You\u2019re honestly right. I was trying to see it like \u201cshe wants to spend time with her kids, that\u2019s not a crime\u201d but she acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t get to pick activities he would actually like, that he has vocally said he hates it, and that it cuts into his personal interests. She wants to spend time with him on her terms only, rather than engage with him as he is and what he actually enjoys. Spot on.", "Yeah, I was confused as well.", "somebody", "It makes me so mad.  It so unfair to him."]}
