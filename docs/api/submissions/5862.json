The parents wanted us to host Christmas in the new house, for them and mums sister and her children/grandchildren. She was aware we haven\u2019t had time to fully clean/repaint the old house. \n\nSo we have been frantically setting up the new house (while working full time and had plans with my parents 3 out of 4 of the weekends) \nWe have done this and hosted Christmas for  all of them paying for everything and housing them (13 people in total) for 2 nights. \n\nDuring this time they went to the old house and took photos of the state of it. (We have had several renters in with us and there is damage to the walls and just general dirt we haven\u2019t had time to clean). (We were also paying rent until my dad said 4 weeks ago to not bother so we had money to fix up the new yard etc). We are aware of the state of the old house, and have had multiple conversations with them about how fixing this is our post Christmas priority. \n\nDuring dinner at a restaurant mum and her sister came out with \u201cwhen we get home I want to project these photos to show everyone the state of the old house\u201d and I said \u201cif you do that you\u2019re getting out of our house and never welcome back\u201d. \n\nThey got up and left and my Aunt also left saying that we had no right to threaten my parents with losing access to their only grandchildren (we didn\u2019t only said the new house). And now my parents are mad at me for saying that. So I wanted to know AITA?\n\nEdit to add. \n\nThe main damage is a bunch from our dog gate and to the wall paint. We have agreed to pay for it to be repainted, and they want to add a door where we had our dog gate anyway. They haven\u2019t yet chosen colours for the paint, and tradies are on a very very long backlog here in Australia but we will pay for a good chunk of the door/ all repainting. We just haven\u2019t had time/ they haven\u2019t picked.

And then to have them take a stab at you? After you've acknowledged fault, made plans AND your wife is panicking? I don't think you handled it graciously, but I don't think I would have either under the circumstances.", "NTA. Why weren\u2019t they celebrating your new house? Why even go to the old house during the holiday, and take other people too? The request to project photos is clearly just to humiliate there\u2019s no other reason to rehash the visit to the old house. Your family was being mean and petty and no one needs that in their life.", "NTA wow your mom and sister are so ungrateful. You seem so reasonable and acknowledge the damage and will pay for it.

And moving? And working? And taking care of disabled parents? And have dogs? And hosting holiday events?   That is just a lot going on.  It\u2019s stressful.  Are you taking anytime to relax?  Probably agreeing to host Christmas was where you went off the rails here, it\u2019s just too much.   You are putting a lot of pressure on yourselves, no human can keep all those plates spinning at once. \n\nYour parents wanting to project all these house projects for extended family to see was a weird request, but you had kind of an extreme reaction.  Maybe you should have just started off with just saying no and going from there.  But I get it, you are probably feeling like they are shaming you, but honestly you have nothing to be ashamed about.  You guys have ALOT going on.  If anything, you could be right up there at the projector pointing stuff out asking extended family for any and all help you can get to get it done.  But if you feel like the whole family is pressuring you to do all of this at once, and to host, etc etc\u2026 then tell them that.  Don\u2019t just start with the extreme end.

So if you snapped at the whole family in a stressful moment, who the fuck cares? \n\nSo yeah, extreme reaction especially if you\u2019ve been going along with everything and all of the sudden this is the first boundary you\u2019ve put up, it was probably a bit jarring.

From here: apologize to your parents and draw up a written plan with timelines and interdependencies (like them choosing paint colors) that you both agree to. Then do that.

That seems like overreactions / unneccisary rudeness all around.", "Leaning more towards YTA. This was a home your parents owned that they let you live in for 8 years (and I'm guessing for rent that is far below local market) and you repay that generosity by subletting to people who trashed the place and then moved out without so much as cleaning the place up so you can move into your shiny new home and spend all of your time and money making it pretty for YOU. \n\nDo you always trash rental properties and then leave then in total disgrace? \n\nI am guessing that your relatives have had a thing or two to say when your parents now have to put their move on hold, at the holidays no less, while you leave their property to rot. No doubt your parents are feeling very cheated, right now. They told you to stop paying rent so you could use that money to get the house back in order and instead you saw it as more money to fix up your NEW home. \n\nYour relatives have seen the state of the house.

It's understandable that you would be upset if your parents were planning to show others pictures of the old house and criticize its condition, especially after you've been working so hard to get the new house ready.\n\nHowever, it's not okay to threaten to cut off your parents' access to their grandchildren as a way of trying to get them to behave in a certain way. This ultimatum may have made your parents feel hurt and disrespected, and could potentially damage your relationship with them.\n\nIt's important to try to communicate openly and honestly with your parents and find a way to address any concerns or issues you may have in a more constructive manner. You mentioned that you and your parents have already had multiple conversations about the condition of the old house and how you plan to fix it up. It might be helpful to have another conversation with them about their concerns and let them know that you are committed to addressing any issues with the old house.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your parents are not responsible for the condition of the old house if you have been renting it from them. As the renters, it is your responsibility to take care of the property and address any damage that may have occurred during your tenancy. If you are unable to address the damage due to financial or other constraints, it might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your parents about your situation and see if there is a way for you to work together to come up with a solution.\n\nOverall, it's important to try to find a way to communicate and resolve conflicts with your parents in a respectful and constructive manner.", "Yess.

No excuse.", "Mmmm you both are kinda aholes but your moms more. You for what sounds like a knee jerk response. It seems like you skipped around talking about why you didn't want her to do that and went straight to threat. The threat alone isn't an ahole last move.

She should have used photos after you were done with the house. Plus it sounds like some reno is coming to the house as is. It's best to do everything at once so you don't do something needlessly.

There is a bunch of paint damaged from our dog gate, but they want to renovate the house and we are finding the tradies for them and have offered to pay for a chunk of their renovations to cover the damage. This has been an ongoing conversation because they want a door where we had the dog gate etc. \n\nAnd the repainting we are going to cover entirely.

So, NTA in any case.", "To be honest half of the over reaction was that my wife had a panic attack about mum and my Aunt going to the house, and I reassured her that they wouldn\u2019t do anything like this (I was wrong) and that if they did I would tell them how not okay it was. So I just jumped to protect my wife as she is very sensitive to these kinds of comments. \n\nWe have hosted 15 people for days and haven\u2019t slept much from all the preparation and cleaning we have been doing. We are also both pregnant so that also makes it very hard to control our emotions. \n\nThe house is a touchy subject, because mum essentially wanted us to organise their full renovations so they could move in in January. And every tradie we contact to organise it say 12 months minimum turn around at the moment (Australia is nuts for trades right now) and they aren\u2019t happy. So she just picks at everything. They also have made us build them an ensuite for when they stay, a ramp for them to get in the house easier, a driveway that\u2019s level and flat. All for them to be able to stay, so we have had to do all of that as well as move In, decorate and set up 8 beds for the family they want us to host, do all the cooking and cleaning for 15 people for 3 days. And the 4 of them for 6 days (both parents and brothers). \n\nBut also attend my mums birthday, her retirement party, help them organise the renovations they want. \n\nWhilst both being pregnant and working full time.

They sound unreasonable / unrealistic about renovations and restoring the house to what it was is fair. Sometimes you cannot just work with family like that", "We spent the three weekends with my parents the ones with the house not my in laws. \n\nWe were paying full market value rent. We have also paid for all maintenance ourselves because we were going to buy it off them eventually. That was the long term goal, but we decided to move into a bigger house. \n\nThe house isn\u2019t that bad of a house. I have rented much much worse. \n\nThere is a small hole in the wall from the dog gate, but they are putting a door there anyway so fixing it seems moot. The walls need repainting (we are paying for this and they know this). The cleaners didn\u2019t clean the blinds or on top of the air conditioner. \n\nFrom opening the house, it looks clean. But my Aunt has rented out many houses in the past and went with them and pointed out all of the damages they typically look for. So every dent or scratch on the wall, every bit of mould in the shower silicone gaps (they weren\u2019t sealed properly during the build and the parents are aware of this), the spiders in the roof, the cobwebs on the outside of the property, the weeds starting to grow through some pavers out the back. \n\nAll really minor things that happen over 8 years, and we were going to go through, and pay for people to do or do ourselves but time has just not been on our side.", "A reasonable, adult response consists of clarity and facts. Which were delivered. Also, they simply responded on the level they were approached.", "Nah, Mum and Sis should have had the decorum to not ask in the first place.\n\nYou are correct in stating that OP did skip a couple steps in diffusing the situation, but their family also had the option to have a private conversation with OP before jumping to \"Hey, lets have a slideshow of your apparent failings in front of everyone.\"\n\nKeep in mind that a conversation was already had about what OP was covering as far as cleaning and repair. So who in their right mind would have a discussion over what was being done with someone that agreed to cover the cost and still want to shame them?\n\nNTA, the response was warranted given the situation.", "They live 90 minutes away at the moment, but only recently decided to move into the old house. They were going to rent it out, in which case we were going to fix it all up. But we discussed with them to add the painting to the renovations and we will pay for a chunk of that instead.", "There is a small hole in the wall where the gate was. \n\nAnd no that is it. I just didn\u2019t want them to publicly humiliate us with pictures of the blinds and the paint. \n\nBut that actually is it.", "You may have had that issue but that\u2019s not what is going on here. And they aren\u2019t even mad about the state of the house, my dad has been there every weekend and knew what it was like. \n\nThey are upset that I threatened to kick them out of our new home if they publicly humiliated us by showing all of the pictures to everyone in my house.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of doing. I\u2019ll repair the house to the exact state it was when we moved it. It will take about 4 days, so two weekends worth and just stop everything else. \n\nNo more organising contractors for their renovations, no more paying bills at the house, so that contractors can work using the utilities, no more dropping everything to come to everything they want us to, and picking them up to drive them everywhere even though they live 90 minutes away, no helping them pack and move, no more hosting them and their family and friends because we have a big house, just being fucking done with helping them ever again.", "That\u2019s a fair analysis. I withdraw my tone policing above.", "Dusty blinds and a hole.from a dog gate are hardly contractor worthy repairs nor are they something to be embarrassed about. You admit that you Sublette and other renter did damage. So what the actual story?", "As if you have a right to 'tone-police' aka censor anyone. Just saying, you don't. Neither do I.", "They want a contractor to do renovations not repairs. They want a bigger ensuite, convert one bedroom into a walk in robe, and another to an extension for the kitchen. \n\nThe repairs we could do ourselves with just paint and patch. And a pressure washer for cobwebs outside."]}
