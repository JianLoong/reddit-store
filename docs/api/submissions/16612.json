I could understand if it was cumbersome (like antique furniture) or something you'd be expected to wear (like a specific brooch on your wedding day) but by your own admission it will literally just sit in a drawer till it's time to pass it down.

Sorry, you're not getting the family sapphires, I guess.", "YTA\n\nThat was your grandma\u2019s way of saying that she would give you something incredibly special to her, that she trusts and loves you for you to have it. You should apologise. What would the harm in having it be for you? Would it burden you? Would it hurt you? You rejected your grandma\u2019s love, that\u2019s so cruel and insensitive.", "YTA. Very self centered response. I get you aren't bothered about this note, but you basically shat all over something your grandma finds important. You'll think back on this with regret in years to come I suspect", "Dude, you literally just need to keep it safe in a drawer. If that's asking too much it can always stay at your parents until you're older. \n\nYou sound incredibly entitled with the whole 'what am I meant to do with it?' bit. Were you perhaps expecting something more valuable? YTA.", "YTA,  The letter should not be wasted with you, it should go to an appreciative family member.", "YTA - come on. You can't keep a note for your old grandma? It's really not that big of a deal to ruin her mood over it.", "Yes, YTA. At 18 it doesn\u2019t mean anything to you today, but it might one day. Family heritage is a big deal to a lot of people. Imagine your life after having kids and they\u2019re doing a heritage project in class\u2026most people would think it\u2019s cool to have a physical peace of History to present.", "Why would it be in a drawer?  That should be framed and on a wall.  I have to say, that is pretty cool.  Why wouldn't you want it?  The guy was your age, actually a year younger.  It doesn't make you think about what it would be like for you to have an abusive father, join the army, get killed?", "YTA - are you missing the context here, that Grandma has chosen you to receive and preserve an article from an important ancestor? Perhaps you don't see this 17 year old's experiences as important. But it sounds worthwhile preserving, if for nothing else than to remember how struggles don't change much over time.", "YTA\n\nYou know that it\u2018s important to her, so instead of hurting her you tell her \u201eThank you, grandma.\u201c and maybe ask a thing or another about it even if you know already and when the time comes that you inherit it you ask family members wether someone wants it who actually cares about it. Otherwise sell it or do whatever you want. But don\u2018t hurt her feelings.", "Why won\u2019t you just take the damn thing? I know 18 year olds are stupid, I was one 2 years ago. But a little bit compassion for your grandmother wouldn\u2019t hurt you would it? Especially since you know she holds it dear to her heart. It\u2019s a piece of actual history and like you said since it\u2019ll be kept hidden why would it matter if you just took it? YTA", "YTA.  If you don\u2019t want this a museum, university, or historical society would probably want it for their archive.  You could have phrased your refusal better or just allowed her to give it to you and then as a favor to her found a home for it.", "YTA.

It won't hurt you to keep it safe until then.", "YTA maybe someday you\u2019ll realize how immature that response was and how much you probably offended her.", "YTA - for being unnecessarily rude. \n\nIt's fine not to want something but, and no offence here, 18 yos are reeeeeally poor judges of value.

You could donate or loan it to them as a gift from your grandmother or in her name so other people could read it. Someone else would surely find it interesting.", "YTA. I undestood that you are not interested in this think, BUT that its no scuse to be Rud.\nYou can said thank you, and thats all.", "This is basically a gift from your grandmother. It's her way of showing she loves you and trusts you enough to pass an important thing (to her) along to you. It's less about the letter itself and more about your grandmother expressing her love and care for you...and you told her you didn't want it. You didn't just reject the letter, you rejected *her*.\n\nAs well, if you're given a gift, you accept it with a smile and thank you, no matter how much you hate it. After all, it's the thought that counts.\n\nYou are 18 and probably don't consider these things yet. But as you get older, so will your grandma. She won't be around forever and you will probably want to treasure whatever of hers that she left behind.

I get it...I do...your attitude is normal for an 18yr old. Trust me in that your feelings towards this kind of stuff will almost certainly change in about 20-25 years.

You don\u2019t have to voice everything you think. *Saying* it makes you the asshole. Just because it\u2019s useless to you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s useless, and it is clearly important to your grandmother.", "YTA - it\u2019s a really cool historical heirloom, and it takes up almost no space! Why not get it framed and hang it somewhere outside of direct sunlight", "YTA. You could have simply said \"thank you\" and if you really don't want to keep it further down the line, make arrangements for it to be donated to a museum. Perhaps the Smithsonian would be interested in it.", "YTA. I wish my granny was still around to give me \"useless\" things.", "YTA.\n\nThis is clearly an important item to your grandmother, and her wanting to give it to you specifically, which probably means she values you a great deal as well.\n\nEven if it's not something you want, you gain nothing (and cause unneeded distress) by rejecting it now, while your grandmother is still alive. This is a perfect situation for smiling, nodding and saying \"thank you grandma\"\n\nThen, when you do get it in the (hopefully distant) future... put it in a box in the closet, or find a relative who might want it instead.\n\nAlso... you're 18. I didn't value family items when I was 18, but man I'd kill for some of my grandparents loved items now at 40 as a reminder of them. Your view of this (and other) items of family importance may become more favorable in time. \n\nYou had nothing to lose by just being polite here.", "YTA - take it from grandmother, don't upset her, and if you don't want it donate it to a museum.", "I\u2019ll take it\u2026\u2026.", "YTA Be better.", "YTA. Someday your grandma won\u2019t be around. You need to apologize.", "YTA\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t want it you could have rejected her in a less cruel way. It\u2019s obviously very sentimental to her and her great-grandma or the people who passed it down to her was very special to her so it meant more than a monetary value. You saying \u201cwhat am I supposed to do with it\u201d, just diminishes all her feelings about her family and it\u2019s history. As an 18 year old you\u2019re definitely old enough to know that there\u2019s no point in making someone feel bad because you\u2019re pissed off that you didn\u2019t get something flashy. Also it\u2019s a letter. If you don\u2019t want it you can just donate it to a Civil War museum. That way your grandma will be assured it\u2019s preserved, a museum has a primary source and you don\u2019t have to look after it.", "YTA - Clearly you've had a much easier life than the 17 year old who wrote that letter. Can you even imagine leaving home and fighting and risking your life for the things you believe in? Just because you've lived in peaceful times, doesn't mean you should be oblivious and uncaring about those that didn't. I think you're a little immature to fully appreciate this letter right now, but that won't always be the case. Apologise to your grandmother for hurting her feelings at the very least and realise that at 18, you're an adult. Start thinking about other people rather than just yourself.", "I understand some people like sentimental objects and some people don't put any emotions towards them.  Your grandmother is the former and you are the latter.    \n\nSo just a soft YTA, because you could have turned her down in a more loving way.  \"Grandma, omg, thank you!  But Aunt Jane really loves this stuff more than me, could we give it to her instead?\"  Or something like, \"I don't think I'd be the best choice, have you seen my room?\"     \n\nJust a suggestion, but you could maybe apologize to your grandma for being insensitive about an object she obviously has fondly kept for decades, and let her know that you don't put the same emotional weight on heirlooms as someone else in the family might.", "YTA.

You BETCHA!", "If you don't want it, find a local museum and donate it.", "I'm not going to render a judgement here.\n\nI just want you to understand that I work at the National Archives.  My daily job is handling documents like your heirloom, and even older ones.  It's a precious, precious thing to find documents hand written by people long dead--especially personal ones from families that were neither wealthy nor prominent.  It's rare.  You're hearing a voice from the past, and that might be the last remaining personal item of theirs that exists.  What you have is a treasure.\n\nBut if you don't love it, find a place to send it.  Someone else in your family might want it.   \n There are many local historical museums and Civil War museums that would like to exhibit a letter like that, because it gives human context to casualty lists.  Especially if the fight the soldier lost his life in was a small skirmish, and there might not be a lot of information on the ones who died.\n\nI can intellectually understand not being sentimental--my husband isn't, particularly.  He wasn't interested in his family history until I did research and found things that made his ancestors more than just names in a list.

This is exactly why I called it incredible that it's lasted this long outside of a museum.  I, personally, would have no idea how to preserve something like this.  Of course, here in 2023, I'm able to look up such information on the internet.  For well over 100 years, it would've been much more difficult to get this information.  Many, if not most, folks tend to give up when something proves to be harder than expected.  I'm sure that's part of the reason why there aren't many letters like this hanging about.\n\nIt's also difficult to predict how historically significant something, even a war, will be in the future.  It's rare that someone decides to save things like this.  OP would be an idiot if he doesn't change his mind and decide to accept and properly care for this letter"]}
