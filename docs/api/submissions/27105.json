If BIL wanted you to be more stingy with a favorite treat then he is absolutely the asshole.", "I'm not really certain that exercise for ice cream is a healthy attitude about weight, food, or body image for a young teen. \n\nWe don't keep it in the house. We go out and get some here and there.", "ESH\n\nYou just took care of his kid for 3 years while he was in jail and he really has the audacity to complain about how much ice cream she ate? Ridiculous.\n\nOn your end, the problem isn't that she ate too much ice cream. It's having such stringent requirements of only X times per week and only if you work out Y amount. Creating a \"currency\" like that around food can screw up someone's relationship with food.", "Uh, she's 16, why are you deciding when she gets ice cream?  I think better would be to teach her an appropriate serving.  (Like a pint isn't a daily serving of ice cream unless you need to gain weight for some reason).  I think the bigger issue here is how everyone is so focused on what she's eating.  That's eating disorder teaching.", "NTA - I always say everything in moderation. If she's otherwise healthy, this one thing is an odd button to press given that you raised his daughter while he couldn't. It sounds like he's not mad about the ice cream, but rather is jealous/guilty about those lost years.", "Lol, NTA.  The guy wasn\u2019t around for three years and then had the audacity to criticize your parenting?\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t agree with a lot of comments here about the ice cream thing.  First off, if she was healthy and well-taken care of anyways, does it really matter that much?  On top of that, you were rewarding her for keeping an active lifestyle, so I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so wrong about that", "NTA. Maybe he should have stayed out of jail and raised her himself. \n\nThe real question is whether she's healthy and happy. If he wants to change the rules now that he's the parent, that's fine. But she was yours those 3 years, and you kept her alive. Good job.", "NTA. Now that he is a parent again he can decide how often she gets ice cream.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The girl learned that she can't get everything for free and has to work for it so it's anything but having given her own way or something.", "NTA.

So much!", "To be fair, it can also create a healthy attitude towards food. Ultimately eating/exercise is transactional if you want to stay healthy, but not to the point of basic food items being transactional. A good understanding of CICO on top of an understanding of what your body needs is very reasonable. Not all food needs to be \"earned\", treats don't even need to be \"earned\" but if you want to consistently eat a high calorie diet there's nothing wrong with accounting for that with extra exercise", "It doesn't. There's a body of studies researching childhood behaviors around food and health outcomes. This isn't an opinion, but a fairly well understood fact about nutrition that's been researched. Restriction and \"earning\" relationships with food lead to more eating disorders and lack of movement in adults.\n\nNutrition has a lot of pop culture around it and we regularly ignore the evidence, unfortunately."]}
