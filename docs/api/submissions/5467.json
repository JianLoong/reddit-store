If OP is somehow older, they're still acting like they aren't.", "Exactly! I was thinking at least some of her preferences as actions are a result of things she's seen at her job. I'm guessing she's seen some messed up stuff and can't unsee it.", "Right? I want to travel with the gf for that reason lol", "I'll do you one in the feels: How is Carmen Sandiego?", "Hopefully good because she was my childhood", "Honestly, it\u2019s kinda like she could probably do better? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Seriously. He basically says the person she fundamentally is annoys him. It\u2019s very clear they aren\u2019t compatible.", "This. Maybe you\u2019d both be happier if you were with someone else more compatible", "He\u2019s an AH and immature. She is on track to have a good future while OP will be a drug addict", "OP can make whatever choices *he* wants about drinking and/or drugs, but to rag on his girlfriend for not partaking makes him look like a loser every.single.time.\n\nI dated a guy just like him.  He got on my case because I didn't want to knock back drink after drink together.  One night I refused to drink and he blurted out at me, \"GOD, are you BORING!\"  He tried getting the bartender in on it and ordered him to make me something.  The bartender had been a spectator to the whole thing, but he turned to my ex and just glared at him, \"I don't make drinks for people who don't want one\".\n\nGuess who ended up with a DUI years after we broke up?", "Yes and it's so embarrassing for OP because the \"bad points\" he's listed all point to her being way too good for him.", "My friend did cyber security and there can be rules in place from the company about having social accounts or what can be posted.", "Also given that she's in cybersecurity, depending on where she works, especially if it's federal, she might be drug tested, and weed even if legal at the state level is still not at the federal level and federal employers aren't allowed and can be fired. They would also frown upon her posting too much on social media.", "Yeah that's what put me off the most, I drink and smoke but to call someone boring because they don't want to? Why the hell did he start dating her anyways", "I hate the stereotype that stoners have given themselves. I love the way weed feels, but holy fuck it\u2019s not a personality. If someone doesn\u2019t want to partake in drugs or drinking, maybe try to include them in sober scenarios??? \n\nLike I have friends that drink, I don\u2019t drink and I don\u2019t participate. I have friends that don\u2019t smoke and those friends hang out with us in sober settings. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s difficult for people to comprehend that friendships should be built on the fact that you care about the person that you\u2019ve met and enjoy the company of, not a shared interest or hobby, because people grow and change and shit happens. \n\nIf you\u2019re not able to just chill and chat, and you need an activity to hang out with someone, you\u2019re probably doing it wrong.", "He wants to share his life you know. Without Instagram pics it doesn't count.\n\nAnd me too.", "Oh, just that I've seen more femme and women talk about the issue and safety concerns involved than men. Not at all meaning to imply that there aren't plenty of men who prefer staying in control. More that, in my experience, it is more just a preference or more neutral choice for men. \n\nBut then, I'm a woman, so there's probably some selection bias in my experiences.", "Was just about to say the same thing.  That girl is dating way, way beneath her station.  I'm betting they don't make it to 2023.", "I'm guessing she *has* dumped him which is why she's not speaking with him. He's just not realizing it. \n\nYTA OP. Life is just as much fun without drinking & smoking. Also, NOBODY *needs* SM or to post their lives online. You call her boring, but you sound pretty exhausting due to how you think living should be.\n\nHer boundaries are normal & her job gives her knowledge that you don't have. Lay off the weed & alcohol & maybe you'd realize that she's right about some things. \n\nEveryone knows that you *weren't* kidding either. You pretty much doubled down in your post which solidifies that you don't like her very much. So why are you with her if you feel this way? Is it money or was she the only woman willing to put up with you? \n\nGood on your friend for letting her know how you truly feel about her & shame on you for what you said. If she's so \"boring\" then set her free & find someone more \"fun\". Hopefully she's dumped you already because *she* deserves better than you. Lay off the weed & drinks for a while & see what life is really like when you're sober with a clear mind, too. Or would that not allow you to use excuses like you were drunk so you could get by with being an AH?", "For real, this guy sounds like a loser stoner that peaked in high school. How the hell did he even get this girl?\nAnd her concerns regarding cameras in airb&bs and social media are totally valid - she's a cyber security engineer. She literally knows how easy that shit is to hack.", "Yeah, idk. Maybe it\u2019s just cause I don\u2019t drink or smoke or anything, but it just seems so miserable to me, having to be drunk or high to feel like you\u2019re having a good time.", "Yep. I totally agree with you. Drinking and smoking should be something you do occasionally (imo) in the same way that gambling, going to the movies, or any cost based activity is participated in. If the rate or amount you\u2019re drinking or smoking would be considered a serious issue if you replaced it with gambling, then you probably need help.\n\nThat\u2019s always been my outlook.", "100% YES. A few times I\u2019ve been too drunk and cried because I love my partner so much my drunk ass couldn\u2019t handle the emotion. I\u2019m a soppy bastard.", "OP\u2019s coming across as the villain in a bad *After School Special*.  YTA dude.", "Carmen San Diego is in the \u201cworld\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My daughter loved that game. It made learning fun.", "The thought of relying on it like that is scary, yeah.", "I was thinking this also. She works in CYBER SECURITY OP! If anyone is aware of the dangers of people stashing webcams and having your face/public information on the internet it\u2019s her! What an asshole. My ex would be mean to me while drunk and then say he was joking. I told him it wasn\u2019t okay to be mean to me whether he\u2019s drunk or not.", "Glad he's your ex!", "ngl when he said it takes her 30 minutes I was like...wait that's it?  30 minutes to check for something extremely terrifying to a young woman that actually happens often. She probably witnessed first hand illegal hotel porn being distributed. Hell, I've seen a few dodgy looking ones when looking up porn myself. \"That woman doesn't seem to know there's a camera, I don't like this.\" Of COURSE she is going to check. 30 minutes seems like nothing to check to me.  She's not flipping mattresses and taking 3 hours, which would be almost still reasonable given her job.", "Me too! I\u2019m with a man now that\u2019s very respectful to me no matter how drunk he is. It\u2019s a good life.", "I'm so happy for you. I hope you have a wonderful holiday together \u2764\ufe0f"]}
