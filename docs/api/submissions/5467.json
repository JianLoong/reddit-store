I don't blame on the air bnb thing, though", "She should break up with you", "YTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how to have fun without alcohol and weed you\u2019re the boring one\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA\n\n>but in my defence I was super drunk\n\nBeing drunk is not an excuse to talk bad about your girlfriend.", "YTA what the fuuuck. Drinking/smoking is so normalized, but it's still unhealthy, and some people just don't like the effects. How is that boring. So what if she doesn't like social media? I wish I used less social media it takes away a lot of time. Also secret cameras in airbnbs are a thing. \n\nTry to consider her side. Why doesn't she like drinking? Maybe it makes her sick. Maybe she doesn't like not being in control. Maybe she has an alcoholic family member. Maybe she feels insecure about how she looks in pictures. \n\nBut you don't do that. You don't take a second to consider her point of view and just want her to be a way that fits into your idea of what someone should be like. And then you laugh about her behind her back and call her boring just because she doesn't like what you like. YTA and your gf deserves better.", "YTA - she\u2019s given you reasons for everything. She\u2019s not making you stop using alcohol/drugs/social media. She\u2019s respecting your choices and she\u2019s even tagging along. Sounds like a great person. Respect her choices.", "You seem very basic and she seems highly intelligent. It's a mistake to be with someone who is less intelligent.", "YTA. Some people value their lucidity. And their privacy. How does that hurt you? Leave her be.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA, and she sounds way smarter than you\nI hope she sees you for who you are and dumps your ass.", "YTA. Do you even like your girlfriend? Sure doesn't seem that way.", "YTA why are you with her?", "You and your friends are so cool for drinking and doing drugs. Is that the only way you can have fun? \n\nYour defense in laughing at her and calling her boring is that you were super drunk? Really? And don't say you were teasing, because you weren't.\n\nIf she's so boring, by making personal choices that are right for her, then why are you with her?\n\nYTA.", "YTA - do you even like her?", "I wonder how long it's going to take for her to dump your AH, drunk and stoned ass.\n\nYTA", ">you want someone more \"mainstream\" who likes social media\n\nSounds boring", "It\u2019s not a convincing defense at all. I hate that excuse! I was drunk/high - you choosing to be get messed up doesn\u2019t absolve you from guilt. You made a choice. \n\n(YTA) as someone who does drugs, drinks etc - if that\u2019s what makes you an interesting person you need to work on you a bit more. She sounds super interesting and since she works in cyber security I suspect her concerns are very valid.", "Good point, GF\u2019s stated reason is not wanting to feel out of control, and here OP is all \u201cI just said mean shit about you bc I was super drunk, lol\u201d I\u2019m sure GF will definitely change her mind about the wonders of alcohol now. YTA OP.", "Was looking for this comment. Girlfriend is correct about social media and recording devices in air b&b. \n\nIt's also not strange for women and femme presenting people to want to stay sober/in control. And that part is completely subjective. Frankly, i find most drunks a bit boring.", "Especially since she's in cyber security. So she probably knows all those things about social media and tech that most people either don't know, or don't want to acknowledge. Her stance is completely reasonable, and she deserves someone more compatible with her.", "Oh, of course, don't forget she needs to loosen up so op and their friends can party without the gf killing the buzz.\n\nNever mind,  often you hear about women getting creeped on with hidden cameras and stuff in rentals, etc.", "Yeah, this. OP is too drunk and high to put 2 and 2 together.", "She's his gf, sounds like that's the only nice thing he founds about her", "But he pokes fun at everyone, y\u2019all!! He\u2019s so fun and she\u2019s so boring! So uptight.\n\nHe needs to do her a favor and dump her if she decides to start talking to him again", "No matter what OPs age is, he is still stuck in the high school loop of friends being his #1 source of everything. \n\nThe longer he and his friends stay enmeshed in this miasma of navel gazing and stupidity the smaller his window of achieving anything meaningful in life will be. \n\nGood news for OPs (soon to be ex) gf as she will be able to periodically look him up and remind herself of the time when she made one bad choice. Since he will be live tweeting every bad decision he does as he does it for decades to come.", "Plus her profession is cyber security, the few college classes I\u2019ve had on the subject are enough to make think twice about this stuff. A whole degree and profession in field, no way I wouldn\u2019t  be \u201cparanoid\u201d", "I thought the same while reading his story. Somehow, while OP tried his best to describe her as this ridiculous unreasonable boring person, with every sentence my opinion of the gf went higher and higher.  \nWhat's a permanent DD?", "That was my tough the whole time I read the post. \n\nYTA and you need to either grow up or break up.", "That's what I thought! \nI'd trust my cyber security working gf that she knows about the dangers of social media. \nAnd there have been loads of cases of recording devices in air bnbs, like.. it'a not like she made up unbelieveable stuff here. \n\nOP clearly doean't enjoy spending time with their gf. \nYTA", "Nah, I read that loud and clear. Agree YTA", "Yeah, you\u2019re clearly not compatible based on how you describe her. Both move on. YTA", "The question honestly is why she even likes him??", "Actually it sounds like the friends, or at least one of them, also thought he's an AH, since they told the girl about his comment. There's nothing wrong that his friends drink or smoke, though, that doesn't make them AH. So far we can only judge that the OP was one.", "Yep. And he clearly said all these things in his post here, I assume being sober...", "Sounds like he is afraid to be single, so is sticking to that girl who he doesn't like. But eventually the truth comes out.", "Lol exactly op doesn't even seem to like her", "YTA, as a women not in security I do a lot of these things to stay safe. Actually the looking for cameras one is new to me and I\u2019ll be starting this as well. Not drinking and doing drugs is a choice that everyone\u2019s allowed to make for themselves. If OPs friend told her the next day about the rude comments then they probably like her more than OP. Truly sounds like an obnoxious AH and gf deserves better.", "How isn\u2019t he an AH? What he did was an AH move. And the fact that he complains/thinks it\u2019s uptight that she won\u2019t drink or do drugs and isn\u2019t comfortable sharing her entire life on social media? That\u2019s also just being an AH.", "Well, to me, too, but I'm not OP.  :)", "> without the gf killing the buzz\n\nAlso, hanging out sober with drunk/high people is annoying as *fuck*.  If she's still there hanging out, taking pictures, being a part of everything *but* the drugs then quit whining.", "i would guess she is going to dump him instead.  or hope so anyway.", "DD = designated driver. I was kinda like this girl in my younger years, I did not do drugs but most of my friends did, so I was the designated driver/babysitter to make sure everyone was ok/safe. I didn\u2019t have an issues with people enjoying themselves, I just didn\u2019t enjoy doing drugs myself.", "She\u2019s also very different to his friends. In that situation, she was absolutely being boring and uptight.  She wasn\u2019t having fun and wasn\u2019t joining in.  She shouldn\u2019t have gone in the first place.  He shouldn\u2019t have brought her.  They both must have known that she was going to be a downer in that situation.  The friends would have known it too (and fwiw I would also be a downer in the same way at a drinks and drugs party, and so I wouldn\u2019t have gone there).  They have no business being together.", "Because they\u2019re just not compatible and so shit is inevitably going to happen.  He said she\u2019s boring and uptight because that\u2019s what he thinks.  He wasn\u2019t doing it to be nasty, he was just speaking his truth.  Don\u2019t feel I can judge him for that.  And she probably thinks equally demeaning things about him that she complains about to her friends.  They\u2019re fine as people, just very very different."]}
