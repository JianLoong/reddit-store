Not asking, telling he WAS coming. With his new girlfriend.\n\nAgain, for some context, my uncle left his wife of 20 years and had since 2-3 girlfriends. Never met them. And his ex-wife and daughter are really mad (can't blame them since he kind of abandonned my cousin and expect her to forgive him everything because family). But I digress.\n\nSo when my father told my mother that they were coming, my mom was kinda mad. Because we had things planned. My mother works in Monday-Friday, and Christmas is coming, so we planned to do pierogis (a type of polish food) this Sunday. And a lot. So it takes time. And my mother really don't want them here. I get it, she don't like my uncle because of what he did (and kinda all my father's side mentality of \"not family if not blood related\", like my aunt or my mother). And she don't want to see the new girlfriend because she met the others and, let's say, my uncle have toxic taste.\n\nSo I was helping my father cook, and he was venting that my mother was upset and never want to welcome my dad's family and is always OK for hers (I mean, they live in Poland, us in France, don't see how she can see them as often as him and they plan in advance to come, like my cousin). And I kinda juste replied : \"Even if it's family you don't just invite yourself. You ask first if it's ok to come. And can't you two just communicate? I'm tired of hearing you two vent to me everytime.\" And he snapped. He started yelling that \"You don't like my family you always forbid me from seeing them. When your mother invite someone she don't ask me permission. Why should I?\" And other things. Like, we don't forbid him, he can see them when he wants, he is a grown ass man, they don't live that far. We just don't like people expecting us to accomodate them in such short notice, especially if forced to.

Your father yelled at you the things he knew he couldn't get away with yelling at your mother. Not that that's an excuse by any means! They need to stop complaining to you.", "NTA,\n\nI want to speak first to the general frustration I see in your venting rather than this situation in particular. I live on the other side of the world from my parents and they \\*still\\* constantly try to pull me into their drama. As an adult living at home, you really need to learn to set some boundaries with your parents. Otherwise you will constantly find yourself pulled into every squabble. When that happens, just try to keep your distance and resist their attempts to \"recruit\" you to their side. Become a master of neutral platitudes.\n\nNow on to the matter at hand. Of course you can't just invite yourself to someone's house (family or not), or at the very least you shouldn't expect them to adjust their pre-existing plans for you. You and your mom should just try to carry on as if your uncle and his new squeeze aren't there as much as possible. Be polite, but don't feel obligated to accommodate.", "NTA but clearly this is between your dad and your mom. Just something you need to know: Not just with your family, you will sometimes hear people vent. You need to learn to gauge when to state an opinion or give an advise and when to just listen.", "NTA\n\nIt is incredibly rude for people to just show up and expect to be welcomed. Good on you and your mum for calling this kind of behavior out.", "NTA. Does Mom do the vast majority of cooking, cleaning and \"host\" prep work for ANY visit? I bet shoe does. So she can invite whoever the heck she wants over...and they invited themselves right? Dad didn't even invite them right? He is just too spineless to call his bro back and tell him they need to reschedule for another date so he is misdirecting his anger elsewhere because he knows he's spineless. No, no one just invites themselves over to your home. People have plans, etc. OR is it possible Dad DID invite his bro without considering his wife's plans for the day and he cannot admit this so he is blaming brother for \"inviting himself\" over? Hmmm. Either way, this is some inconsiderate BS. Tell your Mom to do her thing! Do what she had planned and leave it to your Dad to host. That'll teach em.", "NTA in theory two days isn't too little notice necessarily, but I get that this time of year it's not ideal. What your Dad should have done is make sure there were no plans or issues with them coming around before agreeing, since it was only a couple of days away.\n\nAnd he should absolutely not expect your mother to do all the prep and provisions for their visit. If he agrees to them coming around he can make the plans. \n\nBut this is between them, and you were right in reminding your dad that the person he should be communicating with is your mum.", "Your dad is the asshole", "NTA I understand that your father might feel that his family is treated differently, but you were completely correct in what you said. You uncle should've asked if he could come over with his girlfriend, not only for permission, but also to allow your family to prepare, especially if there is some history. \n\nHowever, I do feel like you should be more empathetic towards your father, since he wants to also spend time with his family.", "YTA if your mom invites people without checking with your Dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you were trying to communicate to your father that it's important to be considerate and communicate with your family members when you want to visit or have them visit, rather than simply expecting them to accommodate you without any notice. You have a right to express your thoughts and feelings to your father, and it's understandable that you would be hurt if he snapped at you and yelled.  \nIn this situation, it doesn't seem like you are the one in the wrong. It might be helpful for you to have a conversation with your father about how to communicate and be more considerate of each other's schedules and plans in the future. It's also important for you to take care of yourself and set boundaries if you don't feel comfortable with the way your father is communicating with you.", "Yes! Never involve your kids in the parent stuff\u2026 not as kids and not as adults. My parents did this to some degree as well and I always hated it. I cannot and will not choose between them. I love them both. It is the reason I forbid my husband to deal with problems when the children are near (or could possibly hear us talking problems out). Children have the capability to make our problems theirs and blame theirselves. And they cannot always see that the little fights we have are not going to break us up. But they don\u2019t know that. And I don\u2019t want them to fear for it or to take any blame. \n\nYou handled it well OP.", "Lol I love the \"master of neutral platitudes\". Will try. Thanks that made me chuckle.

My dad does some things too, but yeah I think my mom does the majority (also because she likes to control things).

My dad will entertain them.", "Yes, polite but firm boundaries are a great way to get ahead of those \"explosions\". Think of them as both a defense and a release valve \ud83d\ude09 I get the sense that other than this family drama you generally have a good relationship with your folks, which is good. But for your own sanity, don't let your affection for them or theirs for you override your sense of self. \n\nI hope you have friends outside the home you can spend time with and talk to. If you don't, make some. Not only is it just good to have friends generally, it's good to have friends you can go see to get you out of the house when you see a parental fracas headed in your general direction.", "that is why i voted NTA. I actually agree with you. Your uncle cant just invite himself, especially at holidays like this.", "Good on you for snapping back. NTA. If he didn\u2019t hire you to be his therapist, he could go talk with your mother like a rational human."]}
