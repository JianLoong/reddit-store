He's their responsibility, not yours. They'll have to figure out what to do when they pass away and the answer isn't \"make her sister take care of him,\" and you should continue to make that known to them.

You did not mention whether you have a job outside the home or not, but you should have one.  I would also go ahead and make plans to move out of the house as soon as possible.  Your mother needs to consider going ahead and putting your brother in a home before she dies.  There is no reason you should be caring for your brother now, or after her death.", "NTA. As someone that worked with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities for years, this story is very common. Parents spoil these children because it\u2019s easier. So many people with ID/DD are given whatever keeps them quiet as children. This makes them spoiled rotten adults.

It sounds like you're close to a mental health crisis. You can't be a good caregiver if you need care!\n\nSecond thing is to come to terms with putting him in a home. After you get out, you need to have a frank conversation with your mom about what she is putting in her will about the guardianship of your brother. It will likely be you. It sounds like you are very young and your mental health isn't great. No judgment, nobody's is when they're in your situation! That means you're not a good caregiver.

What happens to your brother if you die or become disabled?  Unless arrangements have been made, he becomes a ward of the state.  You need to get on with your life.  Don\u2019t let your mom guilt you into anything.  This is not your problem.  Siblings can be close to each other, but they usually all live separate lives.  \n\nWhat surprised me in your post is you state that your mom knew that your brother had conditions.  I\u2019m not suggesting that you should not support her choice, but if she had options, and she and your dad decided to take responsibility for your brother, that\u2019s their decision.  Not yours.

But she should realize now that you will not be his long term direct caregiver. \n\nA great many people with intellectual disabilities do really well in well-run group homes. As part of this conversation, encourage your mother to start looking into group homes. It is usually an easier transition if the person can make visits to the group home over a period of time to get used to it before moving in, rather than the shock of a parent's death and sudden removal to a group home.  That would be hard on anyone, let alone someone with an intellectual disability who might not fully understand what is going on. \n\nYour mom could also take out life insurance that would go towards his care after her death. \n\nThere are all sorts of things your mom could be doing to prepare for the future, but she isn't .

I would be the logical one to be a caregiver for her.  However, the type of care that she needs is not what I could provide for her.  At this point, with your mother aging, you have very few options.

That is fine if they accept that they made that choice and then they live by it. But you did not make that choice. You deserve a life of your own, not to sacrifice it to your sibling's care. \nI don't mean to be callous to your brother or parents as I myself have relatives that need care but there needs to be balance and always a choice.", "Btw this is first contribution to this subreddit, sorry if my etiquette isn\u2019t up to standard.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get out as soon as you can and live a happy life.", "NTA your parents should find a way for their child not the sibling.", "This falls 100% on your parents and not you.  NTAH.", "Kinda sounds like OPs parents have been to busy surviving and normalizing their situation to create a solid plan..\nReally hoping OP\u2019s mom has more than a verbal plan for if something happens to her.. \nIts pretty common that siblings will drop in for their chunk of the estate and bounce leaving OP with the burden of putting him in state care and/ or having to pay for brother\u2019s needs.. op should consider running they deserve their own life.", "Dude your 100% on the right track a  group facility would give your brother a lot of structure. Keep putting pressure on your mom to DEAL.. even just adding respite care (full care offered over the weekend or a couple nights a week to give you a break and potentially ease your mom into letting go of control) \nI can\u2019t imagine what your family has gone through but OP you are an amazing brother and son for choosing to break the cycle that has been surviving and normalizing a really tough situation. Best of luck!", "Your mom has her head in the sand.  SHe will not change unless you force it.  Give her a deadline and mean it.  You are moving out in X months and will not be available to help care for bro beyond 1 day every other weekend (or whatever amount you are willing to do).  Then stick to that plan.  Remind her constantly, ask her what her plan is, and then move out.", "You have your answer- taking care of him full time, if you know it will cause you so much stress, it's no longer a healthy option for him either, right? You being in his life while he's being taken care of else where will mean you vouch for him, you are advocating for him, and doing right by him and therefore you. It's ok. You'll still feel bad about it bc you're a good sibling. You've got this. It's ok. Plz take care of yourself too", "nta. get out of that house, start living your own life.", "NTA. Honey, leave that home as soon as possible. Your brother is NOT your responsibility. Your mother made him the way he is behaviorally and let her deal with it. Run and live your life.  You only live once. Make it count!!!", "NTA maybe you need to just rip the band off nothing will change for you until you take the first step and that sounds like moving out, your mother relies on you too much and sounds like she has become complacent and thinks you will always been around. Maybe sit down with her and your therapist or a social worker and come up with a plan. What would she have done if something happened to you, you can\u2019t have been the plan all along at some point they must have thought about what would happen to your brother long term. You need to be selfish and put yourself first because it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else in your family will. Maybe it might pay to start a bank account with the money you would pay your mother for rent to go towards his care in the future, and if you don\u2019t need it and your parents have been responsible and planned for their deaths then maybe you\u2019ll have a deposit for a house or go on vacation.", "Move. Out.", "You are NTA and need help to separate yourself from the situation as soon as you can get it. Your brother has been enabled to run things in a nonfunctional way. Professional help is needed to help him, and by extension you navigate your lives effectively. Do your homework on group homes in your area. while I agree there\u2019s plenty of horror stories, I also worked 15 years in direct care in some amazing homes. I ran one for awhile as well. If you find a good fit, your brother can thrive. But if routines like the nightly birthday party continue he\u2019ll never be able to live to his full potential. Nor can you expect to if you\u2019re being held hostage to what your parents have enabled. Best of luck to you, I truly hope this situation turns out well for both of you.", "I think your in the right", "NTA. You were not born into this world to spend all of it accommodating your parents. It sucks but when your mom dies he will need something that you should not have to provide. Just research care facilities and choose the one that feels best.", "NTA.", "This.  My ex backpeddled on the care for her brother plan and moved him into my house.

You deserve better.", "I say this as a mother who will be taking care of my (only) autistic son until his father and i find a home for him to live in when his dad and i get older. Your brother is not your responsibility. It's your parents solely. They should have gotten him on government benefits and on lists for group homes/etc when he was a infant or child.", "So NTA.  Listen, this will be hard, but you need to get all your security docs (drivers license, birth certificate, social card, etc) and get out of that house and never look back.  Have you had a chance to research what No Contact is?  I think it's high time, when safe for you to do so, leave the house and completely cut off your mother and brother.  You need to focus on YOUR life now.  Once out, change your phone number, block their emails and all social media, and leave no forwarding address.  Find a new state to live in.  Change your first and last name if you like.  Whatever you need to do to support yourself and your mental health.  God speed", "If you cannot mentally deal with the issues and stress that comes with caring for someone with down syndrome then please dont let it happen. At best you dont ever have a life worth living and at worst youll resent him to the point of murder.", "NTA\nYou need to tell your mum all this, the toll it is having on you. The fact that you deserve to have your own life she chose to have him but you didn't get a say in that and your life shouldn't be forfeit for his. Because your mum wont be able to do this forever and then what does she expect you to give up your life to look after him. If she does she is one selfish woman and the minute you can I would be moving out. You can offer to help her find help but if she wont have it then you can leave she cant make you stay, and it would be shitty of her to try do that.\nYou can love your brother and mother and still want your own life free of burdens that aren't yours to carry, the two things are not mutually exclusive.\n\nTalk with her she may be too worried about him to see whats happening to you.", "NTA. We do not have children for our children to raise. Repeat that a few times. \nI raised my brother, I became a mother at 10 years old. \nOn another note, we all have boundaries and capabilities. Not everyone CAN nor SHOULD take care of special needs kids/adults. \nBoth of my brothers have aspergers and I worked in a group home for the kids with severe, often violent special needs. It's not for everyone, as I learned after ending up being beaten by my student \ud83d\ude10 so no...finding a home for your brother is 100% on your parents. They created and birthed him. Their responsibility.", "Tricky situation but have a serious talk with your mom about your future and that you are drawing a line right here right now. And start looking for your own place to rent asap. She should be understanding that you want to start your own home eventually and need to create an environment for yourself to prepare for all this. It\u2019s her job to find a place or extra care.", "NTA. Your parents CHOSE to have kids, you did not CHOOSE to have siblings. It\u2019s outrageous for your mother to expect you to be his full time caregiver, especially since you offered to pay rent. Honestly your mother should have been looking at options for him, not you. And for your family to expect you to take care of him alone after your mother dies?? I\u2019m really sorry, this situation sounds so stressful. \n\nI have a question though, what does your mother and the rest of your family think about sending him to a home? Or at least getting some help from a professional? Because it\u2019s absolutely outrageous to put all of this on you.", "Ultimately a home is what's best for him. He needs people who are professionally trained to handle his care, and he needs the opportunity--like everyone else--to grow, experience things, and meet new people. That can only happen in a home. There, he might make friends, or discover new activities that will bring him happiness. Sure it'll be hard at first, but it would be unkind and unfair of OP's mom to withhold these opportunities from her son because she doesn't want to transition or because she doesn't see the potential. \n\nMy advice to OP: let your mom know that a home has just as much potential for good as it does for bad. Point out that your brother deserves friends, experiences, lessons, and chances just like everyone else. Perhaps, instead of focusing on releasing the stress from you and your mom, a focus on the potential for prosperity will help convince her.", "NTA you are entitled to live your life. You are not a prisoner being punished and your sentence is to care for your disabled brother your entire life. Please free yourself and enjoy everything in life you are meant to do.", "NTA - I feel for you and can relate as I will be facing a similar problem in the future.", "My wife and I have a similar situation with her niece.  She's 31 years old and mentally around 5 years old.  Her father, my wife's brother, died during the pandemic and with no provisions for her care, my wife's mother took her in. Problem is she's 88 years old, and there's an obvious time limit on this care situation.\n\nI honestly don't have any answers for you.  It's a hell of a thing to have hanging over your head.  My only advice is don't let the long term care decisions be put of until it's all on you.  That's what my wife's brother did, and it's looking like that's what her mother is going to do now again.\n\nMy heart goes out to you, it's a hard thing to have to live with", "How is shouting your parents helpful? If you actually read the post you know it is only mom now, and likely she called the shots when dad was around anyway. Otherwise agree. This is on mom to care for her son, mom has already put too much on kid already, and any stepsibs or other flying monkeys who don't agree with what OP does can just pitch in themselves. You have every right to live your own life.", "NTA\nNot at all.   Every reason you give in your post OP, is 100% correct and 100% valid.  You don't exist to take care of your brother, you're your own person and like you say, you've your own life to live and your own future. \nI understand that your Mom is probably finding things extremely difficult with your brother's incredibly high care needs, and the fact that your dad has sadly passed away.  However it's not your responsibility at all to fix this situation.\n\nYou need to stick to your point, and you hopefully will be able to move out with your bf soon. \n\nYou have every right to live your life, without being your brother's carer, and I truly truly hope that you get to do this.", "Nta, find out how much it would cost to hire a home health aide. Tell your mom that you will either hire an aid or pay the equivalent in rent, but you are not a caregiver for your brother.\n\n\nSucks for everyone, I'm so sorry", "NTA but you have to move out ASAP.", "This reminds me of a post on here about a guy whose mother literally spent THOUSANDS on her special needs son even though doctors told her REPEATEDLY nothing would change. The mother would basically make the sibling take his brother out and dumped the son on him. After a while, he met this girl and wanted to become more serious with her and didn\u2019t want to have the brother tag along with him everywhere. Long story short, he was called selfish. Point is, YANTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think parents realize that once they bring a child into this world, it is THEIR responsibility. Too often, I\u2019ve seen and heard of parents putting \u201cadult\u201d roles on children and not expecting them to want more and when they do, they\u2019re labeled as selfish. You deserve to have a life, do NOT feel guilty about a situation YOU cannot change. If I were you, I\u2019d save up my money and move. Start setting boundaries.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t decide to have him, your parents did. They should search for place, where someone will be able to take care of him 24/7. You need to live your own life, not his.", "NTA - you\u2019ve spent a whole life not being noticed and in the shadows. Of course your going to feel selfish to make something about you for a change. Just don\u2019t let your mum make you think you are for making sure your needs are met. It\u2019s so hard being the \u2018good\u2019 sibling, the one that needs no looking after, we become neglected. And then chronically neglect ourselves as adults, feeling guilty for something to be about us. You need to start advocating for yourself right now, and continue to the rest of your life with employers, when your partners job gets stressful and you self-sacrifice etc etc. you need to make you a priority or no one else will they\u2019ll let you do it.", "I think it was meant to emphasize that it's on the parent to figure the brothers care out, not OP.\n\nI agree, putting parent instead of parents would have been much clearer though.", "I've worked with individuals with autism for 17 years, ranging from 3 years old to adulthood. This topic is brought up very often.  Parents need to plan early, at least in NJ, wait-list for group homes are YEARS long. It's better to be proactive with placement, rather than it be an emergency situation where you have no say where they go.  I've talked to parents with kids in group homes and they say the quality of the time together is better because staff can help and parents are focused more on the time together not dealing with \"care\"\n\nAlso not on you, you're a sibling and entitled to your own life experiences separate from your brother. You can still love and care about him without being a caretaker", "It might be heartless what I will say but if you have means then put your foot down and move out because you mom will not listen to you at this point and you are not a martyr that should sacrifice your life for their mistakes.  \n\n\nIf your mother is left alone to take care of him she might be more open talking about placing him into care he actually needs."]}
