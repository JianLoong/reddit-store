He's their responsibility, not yours. They'll have to figure out what to do when they pass away and the answer isn't \"make her sister take care of him,\" and you should continue to make that known to them.

It does not make you an AH for wanting a life outside of your current situation. Honestly, your mother should not have placed you in such a tough emotional position to begin with.

You did not mention whether you have a job outside the home or not, but you should have one.  I would also go ahead and make plans to move out of the house as soon as possible.  Your mother needs to consider going ahead and putting your brother in a home before she dies.  There is no reason you should be caring for your brother now, or after her death.", "NTA. As someone that worked with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities for years, this story is very common. Parents spoil these children because it\u2019s easier. So many people with ID/DD are given whatever keeps them quiet as children. This makes them spoiled rotten adults.

She is not respecting your feelings or your choices, and she is not considering your brother's best interests either. \n\nHe may need more professional care and support than you can provide, and he may benefit from being in a place where he can interact with other people like him. \n\nConslusion: You are not an asshole for not wanting to care for your brother.", "NTA.

It sounds like you're close to a mental health crisis. You can't be a good caregiver if you need care!\n\nSecond thing is to come to terms with putting him in a home. After you get out, you need to have a frank conversation with your mom about what she is putting in her will about the guardianship of your brother. It will likely be you. It sounds like you are very young and your mental health isn't great. No judgment, nobody's is when they're in your situation! That means you're not a good caregiver.

What happens to your brother if you die or become disabled?  Unless arrangements have been made, he becomes a ward of the state.  You need to get on with your life.  Don\u2019t let your mom guilt you into anything.  This is not your problem.  Siblings can be close to each other, but they usually all live separate lives.  \n\nWhat surprised me in your post is you state that your mom knew that your brother had conditions.  I\u2019m not suggesting that you should not support her choice, but if she had options, and she and your dad decided to take responsibility for your brother, that\u2019s their decision.  Not yours.

But she should realize now that you will not be his long term direct caregiver. \n\nA great many people with intellectual disabilities do really well in well-run group homes. As part of this conversation, encourage your mother to start looking into group homes. It is usually an easier transition if the person can make visits to the group home over a period of time to get used to it before moving in, rather than the shock of a parent's death and sudden removal to a group home.  That would be hard on anyone, let alone someone with an intellectual disability who might not fully understand what is going on. \n\nYour mom could also take out life insurance that would go towards his care after her death. \n\nThere are all sorts of things your mom could be doing to prepare for the future, but she isn't .

I would be the logical one to be a caregiver for her.  However, the type of care that she needs is not what I could provide for her.  At this point, with your mother aging, you have very few options.

They had him knowing his disabilities - that was their choice. They raised him in the way they have and haven't looked into programs or care facilities - that was their choice. That is fine if they accept that they made that choice and then they live by it. But you did not make that choice. You deserve a life of your own, not to sacrifice it to your sibling's care. \nI don't mean to be callous to your brother or parents as I myself have relatives that need care but there needs to be balance and always a choice.", "Btw this is first contribution to this subreddit, sorry if my etiquette isn\u2019t up to standard.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
