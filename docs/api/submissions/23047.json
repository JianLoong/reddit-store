I grew up very independent because my parents and family were more focused on my bro. \n\nI\u2019ve been constantly offering to start paying rent instead of taking care of this kid. Im 22, I shouldn\u2019t be ignoring my own potential and future because my dad made a shitty decision and my mom won\u2019t let me pay rent. My mom is getting older and it makes me wonder. When she passes, I\u2019ll have to take care of him. He needs 24/7 care. I want to have my own kids, my own family, a job, a LIFE. I\u2019ve been living with this kid for my entire life now. I know what it\u2019s like and I\u2019d hate to see myself decades later doing this same bullshit. My half siblings got to leave the house and do as they please.

Not all facilities are the same and finding one who can give the care needed for your brother could be hard to find and very expensive.\n\nBut,  OP,  this is on YOUR PARENTS,  not you.\n\nYou deserve to have a life of your own and your  brother deserves to be in a place where they can give him the care and support he needs.\n\nNTA", "NTA,  Your parents need to start looking at homes now.", ">He needs 24/7 care\n\nThis right here makes you NTA.\n\nIt's one thing to have to help out a sibling every now and then, like have them stay with you while they're transitioning to a new place to live, maybe lost a job and just need a little money in between before they get back on their feet, but you are NOT obligated to care for them 24/7 unless you want to.\n\nCaring someone for 24/7 is extremely difficult to do, as I'm sure your parents have shown you, and that's with two dedicated parents. He's their responsibility, not yours. They'll have to figure out what to do when they pass away and the answer isn't \"make her sister take care of him,\" and you should continue to make that known to them. I know it'll be hard to make that decision but clearly caring for him in a limited capacity is already taking its toll on you - now just imagine living that way 24/7.", "NTA - It\u2019s an extremely hard thing to reconcile the knowledge that someone you love needs more care than you can give them and still retain your own mental, physical, and emotional health. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve tried, looked into options, done your own mental health work, and the unfortunate truth is that your brother needs full-time care. It does not make you an AH for wanting a life outside of your current situation. Honestly, your mother should not have placed you in such a tough emotional position to begin with. She certainly should not be saying that you should devote your life to your brother\u2019s care now or in the future. You deserve to have your own life.", "NTA.   You did not mention whether you have a job outside the home or not, but you should have one.  I would also go ahead and make plans to move out of the house as soon as possible.  Your mother needs to consider going ahead and putting your brother in a home before she dies.  There is no reason you should be caring for your brother now, or after her death.", "NTA. As someone that worked with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities for years, this story is very common. Parents spoil these children because it\u2019s easier. So many people with ID/DD are given whatever keeps them quiet as children. This makes them spoiled rotten adults. And when the parents pass and the siblings are left to care, they become forgotten or neglected.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not responsible for him, and you have your own life and dreams to pursue. You have been caring for him for your entire life, and that is a huge burden and sacrifice that you never asked for or agreed to. You have done more than enough, and you deserve to be happy and free. \n\nYour mom is being unfair and unreasonable by expecting you to take care of him forever, and by not letting you pay rent instead. She is not respecting your feelings or your choices, and she is not considering your brother's best interests either. \n\nHe may need more professional care and support than you can provide, and he may benefit from being in a place where he can interact with other people like him. \n\nConslusion: You are not an asshole for not wanting to care for your brother.", "NTA. I have a mentally ill family member we siblings all know we're going to have to take care of and we're kind of playing hot potato about it once her caretaker died. She's already sliding downhill and it's a matter of time before it becomes critical, but none of us are ready to give up our lives for it.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is work on getting out. It sounds like you're close to a mental health crisis. You can't be a good caregiver if you need care!\n\nSecond thing is to come to terms with putting him in a home. After you get out, you need to have a frank conversation with your mom about what she is putting in her will about the guardianship of your brother. It will likely be you. It sounds like you are very young and your mental health isn't great. No judgment, nobody's is when they're in your situation! That means you're not a good caregiver. You can't light yourself on fire to keep other people warm. Even if a house isn't ideal, it's better than you. They're licensed and trained. You are not.", "NTA, I have an uncle with DS & he lives in a home in Brookshire, TX. Do research & find a place well suited for him.", "Op this is the question you need to ask yourself.  What happens to your brother if you die or become disabled?  Unless arrangements have been made, he becomes a ward of the state.  You need to get on with your life.  Don\u2019t let your mom guilt you into anything.  This is not your problem.  Siblings can be close to each other, but they usually all live separate lives.  \n\nWhat surprised me in your post is you state that your mom knew that your brother had conditions.  I\u2019m not suggesting that you should not support her choice, but if she had options, and she and your dad decided to take responsibility for your brother, that\u2019s their decision.  Not yours.  Get on with your life.  You deserve it.  Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou should never, ever have been your parents' long-term plan for his care. \n\nWhen you feel safe, sit down with your mother. Explain that you cannot and are not willing to spend the rest of your life being your brother's one on one aide and support. If you are willing, you can tell her that you will be his guardian, and supervise his care at a group home or other facility. But she should realize now that you will not be his long term direct caregiver. \n\nA great many people with intellectual disabilities do really well in well-run group homes. As part of this conversation, encourage your mother to start looking into group homes. It is usually an easier transition if the person can make visits to the group home over a period of time to get used to it before moving in, rather than the shock of a parent's death and sudden removal to a group home.  That would be hard on anyone, let alone someone with an intellectual disability who might not fully understand what is going on. \n\nYour mom could also take out life insurance that would go towards his care after her death. \n\nThere are all sorts of things your mom could be doing to prepare for the future, but she isn't . There is nothing stopping you from doing research and devising a plan, though.", "NTA.  I'm going through almost this exact thing with my grandmother right now.  She needs 24/7 care at this moment.  I would be the logical one to be a caregiver for her.  However, the type of care that she needs is not what I could provide for her.  At this point, with your mother aging, you have very few options.  If you want to live your own life, putting him into a facility is really the best thing.", "NTA\nYour parents parentified you from a young age - by your own admission, you grew up independently because they didn't have time to raise you, their other child. They had him knowing his disabilities - that was their choice. They raised him in the way they have and haven't looked into programs or care facilities - that was their choice. That is fine if they accept that they made that choice and then they live by it. But you did not make that choice. You deserve a life of your own, not to sacrifice it to your sibling's care. \nI don't mean to be callous to your brother or parents as I myself have relatives that need care but there needs to be balance and always a choice.", "Btw this is first contribution to this subreddit, sorry if my etiquette isn\u2019t up to standard.", "See if you can have him double the extra chromosome and give it to the next person", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just want what\u2019s best for everyone included in this situation, myself, my mom, and my brother. There is a solution that everyone gets what they want, it\u2019s putting him in a home. It sucks to accept that, but I have, now my mom needs to.

I feel terrible even thinking about putting him in a home but the sad reality is that neither me or my mom are built for this. No hate on my mom I love her dearly.

Not just the aging factor but I was not made to care for others in this matter. I look forward to being a mother to my own children in the future, but this is a life long 150 pound toddler we\u2019re talking about.
