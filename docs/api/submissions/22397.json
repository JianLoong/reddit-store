Thank you, I really appreciate your words\ud83d\udda4", "I didn't even need to read the full post before I came to the decision that you're NTA here. It is not up to the parents if they want you there or not, it is up to the couple getting married. You were invited. If anything, Jane needs to uninvite her mom because she is being entitled an jerk trying to control who can & can not come to her wedding, which they have no business doing in the first place.\n\nNow, I am sure some people would disagree on the stance of; \"If the parent(s) helped pay for it, then they have a say in who shows up.\", No, no they don't have a choice, regardless of if they helped pay for it or not. I know if my mother ever tried pulling a stunt like that when I get married, she would be the one who is uninvited and I would most likely go no contact.\n\n'OP, go to the wedding. Celebrate this beautiful occasion with your friend. The first wedding, is  a once in a lifetime opportunity. If you didn't show up, it'd probably break her heart. Not to mention if you don't show up, then you are just allowing the bully in this situation to win, and knock you down. The best way to defeat her mother is to show up & have fun.", "NTA because JANE invited you and clearly wants you to be there\n\nBut for the sake of any love you once had for John/Jane's parents, DON'T take new boyfriend.  Sorry that would be rubbing it in their face.  \n\nGO, and stay chill, don't let them provoke you(stay on other side of room as much as possible).  Also be prepared to leave if it becomes untenable--You can likely get through the ceremony without a problem(they will be busy and it's not really a mingle situation) but at reception, make a plan.    \nTake Paul Simon's Advice:    \n<<*You just slip out the back, Jack*  \n*Make a new plan, Stan*  \n*You don't need to be coy, Roy*  \n*Just get yourself free*  \n*Hop on the bus, Gus*  \n*You don't need to discuss much*  \n*Just drop off the key, Lee*\\>>", "NTA - also want to add that as someone with a chronic illness, if I pass before my husband, I hope he finds love again and that that love is accepted by all.", "YTA-they lost a son that they cannot replace.

It\u2019s a pity that the day will 100% be drama filled. \n\nEspecially when your bf seems to be close to the family as well, as he knows Jane and groom longer than you. For the parents - yeah they\u2019re grieving. Losing their kid and watching the partner get a new one not even 5 months later is weird as hell. Somebody will for sure cry, either parents, bride or you - it\u2019s a lose lose situation tbh", "In comments, you mention having spoken with Jane about your fears, it looks like? If she knows you're worried her parents will make a scene at their daughter's wedding and she STILL wants you there, I'd encourage you to go. \n\nYou're NTA either way, but it is HER day, and if SHE wants you there and you love her, I'd encourage that you go. \n\nThat said, maybe have some plans in place- I was fully prepared for two bulky friends to bounce my sister if need be from my wedding if she went into her normal Make A Scene Mode and we had folks on standby if my partner's family decided to Make A Scene (nonbinary and preferred nontraditional clothing and their parents hate it, but it was OUR wedding so if we both wanted to wear the attire we were comfortable in, by golly we were). I also spoke with the likely Scene Partners for my sister to make sure they knew to literally walk away if she started, so it wasn't about the scene or them and so that afterwards it was obvious it was HER and not THEM. \n\nI'm not saying get her to plot bouncer friends, but definitely be prepared for how to step away and how to let it go and move away from it if Her Parents make a scene? Don't be part of it, essentially- if they choose to pursue a scene and cause an issue, everyone will know its Them and not You. \n\nIf you don't go, in five years, will you be more sad you missed out celebrating her or more happy you didn't interact with them? \n\nGood luck to you and to Jane. <3", "Nta. Go.", "I would go to support her 100%  if she wants you there go. If drama starts maybe be willing to leave early but I'd go, the bride gets what she wants lol. Sorry for your situation.

I'd discuss it with her and make sure she knows you're concerned about things and that you'd accept if she changed her mind.", "Maybe it's time to forget about the past and move forward.\n\nPeople that don't like you generally never will.

Not the asshole at all, but tread cautiously.", "NTA. But I don't think you should go. Jane has shown you she wants you there and that you are welcome. Brides barely spend time with their guests. I would not want to take the chance that your presence causes drama, so why risk it? Better to invite her and her new husband to lunch or dinner after they return from their honeymoon. Then the four of you can properly celebrate.", "NTA since Jane's adamant about you coming to the wedding.

This is not about them, though. This is Jane's day and she wants you there as much as you want to be there for her.

That's really hard. No wonder they are acting out. That's gotta be a lot of guilt and shame. It doesn't make it OK how they're acting about you going to the wedding, but it makes sense that they are looking for someone to blame.", "I definitely agree on the parents. I was an ass for a little while when my mom started dating a guy \"too soon\" after my dad passed. The only person it was too soon for was me and I had to come to terms with that and luckily I was able to pretty quickly. Sounds like the parents are still very raw over their lose and have found the easiest outlet for their grief/anger. They're definitely wrong but hopefully with a little time they'll realize that OP loved their son and he would want her to continue on and be happy with the rest of her life.", "Then go. Jane, who knows very well that you loved and helped her brother as best you could, wants you there, so be there for her. She's grieving her brother too - your presence at her wedding might help that.\n\nAs for your late fiance's parents, they're grieving the death of their child, and there are no words in any known language that can capture the depth of such grief. You're their target right now because, over a year after your fiance's death, you are starting to move forward with your life, which is very healthy and appropriate. But his parents haven't been able to do that yet, so to them the fact that you are moving on is a betrayal. They're wrong, but they won't be able to see that until they're emotionally ready to do so (which may be never).\n\nGo to the wedding. Sit well apart from your late fiance's parents, don't attempt to introduce your new boyfriend to them unless they seek an introduction, and ask Jane to seat you far from her parents at the reception. You are NTA at all.

For your own sanity. Check where you're sat, try to make sure you're not in their eye line as much as possible, arrive/leave at different times, etc.\n\nNo, you shouldn't have to. But the last thing you want, is them starting a fight. Seeing you at their daughter's wedding, with the new guy (whilst they're thinking they won't ever see John get married), might indeed spark conflict. That's only something that will distress you (and possibly spoil the wedding).\n\nSo for your own emotional wellbeing, try to reduce opportunity for that. Good luck.", "You loved and cared for her brother. You were the person he loved and she wants you there.", "Please don\u2019t marry another alcoholic. You do not have to put yourself in a caretaker role. Women do that at their own expense.

Then politely ignore them.", "Or maybe not, that's not explained anywhere.

But it is a very delicate situation and even OP is feeling the emotions and anxiety.   Honestly the bride needs to step outside her own desires and look around to see what is best for everyone involved. If OP is uncomfortable,  parents are uncomfortable and OP can\u2019t (and really shouldn\u2019t) take her SO as emotional support- then maybe Jane can get past OP not being at the wedding.
