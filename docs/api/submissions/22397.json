This is her day and she's shown she wants you there and supports you. She supports you so much she included your new partner. \nSounds like the parents are still grieving and placing all the blame on you cause they can't accept they might have drove their child to this.

But they are so proud they will never say it. \nPlease go for her and know you arent not pooping on your late fianc\u00e9 memories. Infact, showing you are still this close to sister, proves you are honoring by being there for her when he can't now.

You are strong enough to handle this, remember that those who  matter understand you and love you. Enjoy the wedding celebrating the love of someone you care about.

That alone will be very challenging & her parents should be given grace. Everyone should be allowed to celebrate this event with their family in peace.
