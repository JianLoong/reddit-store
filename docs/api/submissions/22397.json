It's important to Jane and she's clearly a wonderful friend. Honestly I think it's more likely that your presence could actually dislodge some of that debilitating pain the parents are feeling.

You are not the main character in this story. \n\nI am sympathetic to your position, and it isn't really fair to you, but this is a moment when you can rise to the occassion and do kindness for your SIL but removing the stressor from the equation. You are the stressor.\n\nYou're NTA but you shouldn't go to this wedding if it's going to cause a conflict for the bride.", "This removes all agency from Jane - she wants op at her wedding and is very clear it wasn't just an invitation to be polite.  So op should attend.", "Maybe but Jane is also being forced into a position where she has to choose, which is wrong. So, out of respect and love for her, I wouldn't put her in that position. In time, the odds are that the bride will miss and regret not having her parents at her wedding. I would not want to be the person who took that from her.", "Her parents will be there. That\u2019s not a question. As they should be.", "The bride already made her choice when she adamantly stood up and defended the OP. The bride had decided and is aware of the consequences. She is an adult. It's her wedding. She can decide who she wants there and had made her choice blatantly known.", "Good I'm glad to hear that. \n\nAnd please don't take this to mean I am not sympathetic, and I know it's isn't particularly fair to you. I responded, knowing I would get downvoted to hell because you asked for perspective. I think that it is important to take a step back and see it from this angle as well. I'm just thinking about what is best/easiest for the bride. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and can't imagine how difficult the last few years have been. I wish you all the best.", "Really! Thank you for presenting me with a totally different perspective than I have received! I very much value what you said and why. Thank you, I really appreciate your words\ud83d\udda4"]}
