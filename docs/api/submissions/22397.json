It sounds like his family is still grieving and they\u2019re taking it out on you (which isn\u2019t fair).", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t attend.

What her parents wants is immaterial.", "NTA. I don't see mom and dad are getting married, i see it's their daughter and someone who was already sister level close to you is getting married. This is her day and she's shown she wants you there and supports you. She supports you so much she included your new partner. \nSounds like the parents are still grieving and placing all the blame on you cause they can't accept they might have drove their child to this. You were there when they wouldn't and that parent guilt is still eating them cause they know. They know they didn't step in and help like you did. But they are so proud they will never say it. \nPlease go for her and know you arent not pooping on your late fianc\u00e9 memories. Infact, showing you are still this close to sister, proves you are honoring by being there for her when he can't now. Bring tissues \u2764\ufe0f this is coming from someone with horrible social anxiety to any level. I can't leave my house without taking meds. So i understand how crippling anxiety can be. Just be there for her because she wants you there.", "NTA - but please talk with Jane and make clear that it is her day and that you appreciate that she fought for you, but if she is afraid that the conflict will ruin her day you are willing for her to stay away.", "NTA, it's her wedding, not her parent's", "NTA, The Bride wants you there and has made a point of it.

You have every right to attend. You also have the right to preserve your peace. Know that you can leave at any time.", "NTA.  The bride envied you both.", "YWBTA if you allow John\u2019s family to prevent you from honoring his sister. They sound shallow, and I hope you reconsider and put on a brave face to go to the wedding.", "NTA, but perhaps keep a low profile on the day. Just to avoid any drama with the parents. For example, try sit far away from them during the service/meal etc.", "Nta, but you will be if you let your anxiety win. You are strong enough to handle this, remember that those who  matter understand you and love you. Enjoy the wedding celebrating the love of someone you care about. Let the noise of the parents fall to the side because if they choose to make their daughters wedding about you by criticizing/talking about you remind them that it\u2019s not your day but there daughters, and the focus should really be on the joyous union. You got this!", "NTA.  It's the bride's day, and her choice.", "NTA. The parents guilt is driving their misguided anger towards you. So sorry for your loss. You have every reason to move forward with your life. Have fun at the wedding.", "You\u2019re not an ah whatever decision you make ...... however weddings are not the place for drama. Jane & her parents should be allowed to enjoy this event. Politely declining the invitation would be the kind thing to do. You & Jane can celebrate together another time.\n\nIt\u2019s great that Jane is a such a wonderful friend however it will not go unnoticed by this family that this event is happening without a brother & a son. That alone will be very challenging & her parents should be given grace. Everyone should be allowed to celebrate this event with their family in peace. Without disruption.\n\nNAH\n\neta \u2014 you could just attend the ceremony. I highly recommend you don\u2019t bring your boyfriend. It\u2019s really not fair to him to be involved in this situation. I\u2019m not saying you did anything wrong here but grief is a powerful emotion & it can get the best of the most well behaved & kind people.", "NTA, fuck what the parents want it\u2019s not their wedding they sound a bit knobheadish", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
