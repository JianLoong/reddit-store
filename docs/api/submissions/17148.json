You acknowledge that your jokes can be acerbic and near the knuckle, and those kind of jokes don't always land with people.  Some people find those jokes offensive, and as the comedian, it's on you to make sure your audience is ok with your jokes.

My absolute uninformed opinion is that you act this way with new people to see if they will have your back, like a forced inclusion of military brothers, who, whether or not they like you or not, are supposed to be there for you.

They are very different things. And disability isn\u2019t a monolith. It\u2019s an umbrella. And there\u2019s tension in the LGBTQ+ umbrella (which I am also part of) about co-opting, erasing and assuming no nuance between different \u2018spokes\u2019 of the umbrella. It gets spiky.\n\nAlso as a woman with PTSD partly from growing up in a civil war but also because of prolonged sexual abuse, I find \u2018let\u2019s make trauma jokes our bonding thing first off the bat\u2019 never bodes well. It\u2019s usually triggering AF for me especially if it\u2019s a man and playing into veteran PTSD specific aspects.\n\nPlus disabled people can be ableist, lack empathy and not know shit about other disabled people\u2019s lives, experience or feelings especially if they have only just met them. Equality is getting the consequences of being an asshole while disabled instead of treated like some kind of special case when you fuck up.\n\nI don\u2019t like joking about my disabilities with 99% of people but when I do, I have a really dark sense of humour. But I grew up with a traumatised population so learned early you can use dark humour but there is always the risk it will backfire even when you know someone well because with trauma especially it is as I\u2019m sure you know always day to day. \n\nI claim zero insight into the disabled experience of an amputee because it is utterly unlike mine. We might have shared experiences of abled bodied people reacting but honestly I don\u2019t necessarily have much in common with a lot of disabled people compared to those who don\u2019t meet a PTSD diagnosis but have had tough times. For example I\u2019m semi bedbound so the Paralympics is as insightful to me as a disabled person as abled sports. It\u2019s all stuff I cannot physically do due to fatigue. I\u2019d relate more to elderly people because my body thought it was 80 when I was eight.\n\nOh yeah and there\u2019s another massive lack of insight: people born with disabilities and those who acquire them and when they do tend to have more to bridge. I have had disabilities since childhood so someone who develops theirs as an adult?
