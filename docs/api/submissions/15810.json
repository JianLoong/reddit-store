Paige asked if that meant that she could still have the birthday party that she and her friends had planned. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because I still wasn\u2019t happy with her for lying to me in the first place. Paige said that she was more way upset about having to tell her friends that her party was cancelled than about having to share a party with Dylan, and that she didn\u2019t really get why I was apologizing for that instead. I asked Paige what she thought a more appropriate consequence for lying was instead of having her party cancelled, and she suggested getting grounded, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with. Lastly I told Paige that since I know she and Dylan are getting older now, I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year. Paige said that she only did this year because her friends decided they didn\u2019t want any boys. I told her that was fine and I guessed we\u2019d just talk about it again next year.\n\nAnd then I told Dylan that I was letting Paige have her all-girls party with her friends, and that I realized I shouldn\u2019t have used sharing a birthday party with him as a punishment because that wasn\u2019t fair to either one of them. Dylan said it was okay and that if he was having a solo party after all, he knew what he wanted to do for it. I also told Dylan that since he and Paige are getting older now, I\u2019d start assuming that they want separate parties unless they tell me otherwise. Dylan said he guessed that made sense.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much it, Dylan and Paige are each having their own party. And at some point they talked it out between themselves as far as Dylan\u2019s feelings being hurt that Paige hadn\u2019t talked to him about what she wanted to do this year, I wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation but they\u2019ve been friends again since it happened.", "created_utc": 1682604813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130ng9c/update_aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_share_a/", "score": 85, "replies": ["I am glad it worked out, BUT I think you need to think about WHY she lied?  Does she feel that you always favor Dylan?", "That's more like it!\n\nHowever: that grounding had better be a token brief one. Yes she lied, but in response to an unreasonable situation that *you* created.", "Nice to see a happy ending, glad this got resolved. And happy birthday to your kids!", "INFO: What's Dylan planning on doing for his party? Also you never mention a partner anywhere so if you supervise one party, who would supervise the other?\n\nI think you made the right choice, just a few worries about logistics", "Couldn't ask for a better resolution.", "I missed your original post, but I think you were judged too harshly by the responses.\n\nI am a twin and I am (or have been) friends with 7 or 8 sets of twins throughout the course of my life. Sharing a birthday party, as a minor, is par for the course.\n\nIt isn't an egregious affront to individuality. It just often makes the most sense logistically and it also pays homage to the fact that they were born together.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule that says they have to share the same party, but lying and trying to manipulate your way into a separate party (without even discussing it with your twin) is a bullshit move.\n\nThere are multiple ways to address this situation, but it begins with open communication, not manipulative tactics, to get what you want.\n\n\nAs parents of a twin, it is important to support their individuality. It is also important to address unnecessarily manipulative behavior by any child.\n\nThrowing two separate parties is great, if you can pull it off both logistically and financially. \n\nIt is just as important to hammer home the message that honest communication is the best means with which to advocate for your needs and desires while balancing these against the needs and desires of the people you care about.\n\nIt is great that both children were ultimately happy with the solution. It just needs to be made clear that lying and manipulation aren't the best tools for getting what you want.", "Perfect in my opinion.", "I don\u2019t really understand why Paige is being punished for lying. She lied because you force them to each be half of a matching set, and probably because she knew how you\u2019d react. I\u2019m still seeing this as a you issue. \n\nGlad they both get their own party now.", ">but in response to an unreasonable situation that *you* created.\n\nI still don't entirely agree with that, because Paige made it pretty clear that she never had a problem with the concept of a sharing a party and that wasn't the reason behind her lying. But that said, yes, she's only grounded for a week.", "A movie and then laser tag, he found a place that does a birthday package for X number of guests. I'm not too worried about the logistics, I think they're old enough that I probably don't need to supervise either party.", "Forcing 14 year old twins to share a birthday isn't cool. Neither is the concept that if one wants to share and the other doesn't, too bad so sad, you're sharing. \n\nI'd be more focused on the fact that she was afraid to be open than the fact that she lied. This isn't a pattern of behavior for her. Someone forced her hand here. She made a mistake, but let's not go crazy about it.", ">I missed your original post, but I think you were judged too harshly by the responses.\n\nThanks, I think so too. A lot of people really went off the rails and made the issue into something completely different."]}
