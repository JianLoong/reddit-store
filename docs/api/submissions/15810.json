Paige asked if that meant that she could still have the birthday party that she and her friends had planned. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because I still wasn\u2019t happy with her for lying to me in the first place. Paige said that she was more way upset about having to tell her friends that her party was cancelled than about having to share a party with Dylan, and that she didn\u2019t really get why I was apologizing for that instead. I asked Paige what she thought a more appropriate consequence for lying was instead of having her party cancelled, and she suggested getting grounded, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with. Lastly I told Paige that since I know she and Dylan are getting older now, I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year. Paige said that she only did this year because her friends decided they didn\u2019t want any boys. I told her that was fine and I guessed we\u2019d just talk about it again next year.\n\nAnd then I told Dylan that I was letting Paige have her all-girls party with her friends, and that I realized I shouldn\u2019t have used sharing a birthday party with him as a punishment because that wasn\u2019t fair to either one of them. Dylan said it was okay and that if he was having a solo party after all, he knew what he wanted to do for it. I also told Dylan that since he and Paige are getting older now, I\u2019d start assuming that they want separate parties unless they tell me otherwise. Dylan said he guessed that made sense.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much it, Dylan and Paige are each having their own party. And at some point they talked it out between themselves as far as Dylan\u2019s feelings being hurt that Paige hadn\u2019t talked to him about what she wanted to do this year, I wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation but they\u2019ve been friends again since it happened.", "created_utc": 1682604813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130ng9c/update_aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_share_a/", "score": 726, "replies": ["I am glad it worked out, BUT I think you need to think about WHY she lied?

Sharing a birthday party, as a minor, is par for the course.\n\nIt isn't an egregious affront to individuality. It just often makes the most sense logistically and it also pays homage to the fact that they were born together.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule that says they have to share the same party, but lying and trying to manipulate your way into a separate party (without even discussing it with your twin) is a bullshit move.\n\nThere are multiple ways to address this situation, but it begins with open communication, not manipulative tactics, to get what you want.\n\n\nAs parents of a twin, it is important to support their individuality. It is also important to address unnecessarily manipulative behavior by any child.\n\nThrowing two separate parties is great, if you can pull it off both logistically and financially. \n\nIt is just as important to hammer home the message that honest communication is the best means with which to advocate for your needs and desires while balancing these against the needs and desires of the people you care about.\n\nIt is great that both children were ultimately happy with the solution. It just needs to be made clear that lying and manipulation aren't the best tools for getting what you want.", "Perfect in my opinion.", "I don\u2019t really understand why Paige is being punished for lying.

Neither is the concept that if one wants to share and the other doesn't, too bad so sad, you're sharing. \n\nI'd be more focused on the fact that she was afraid to be open than the fact that she lied. This isn't a pattern of behavior for her. Someone forced her hand here. She made a mistake, but let's not go crazy about it.", ">I missed your original post, but I think you were judged too harshly by the responses.\n\nThanks, I think so too.

She knowingly lied, knowingly hurt her brothers feelings\u2026because her friends told her to. Then she doubles down and gripes about her party being cancelled as a potential punishment\u2026because her friends will be upset with her. I\u2019m not loving her friends. I also think she\u2019s getting off super light here with being \u201cgrounded\u201d, though it\u2019s never expressed what that actually entails.", "I like a good success story. Way to make it right!", "Honestly you shouldn't ground her. \n\nYou created a really bad situation and yes she rebelled. When children sneak and lie it's usually due to fear, mistrust etc. You created an untrusting environment. Are you getting grounded for being an AH?\n\nMove on let her be.", "Here's a wild parenting philosophy: not every thing a kid does that's \"wrong\" needs a consequence/punishment. \n\nSometimes just talking about an issue calmly together can have a more meaningful impact. If another person has been hurt by a child's actions, making that up to them is a better approach.", "She shouldn't be punished. You need to take responsibility for creating that situation.", "It amazes me that parents these days are letting their kids have a democratic voice in their punishment at 14 years old as if a 14 y/o has any reasonable brain development to honestly tell their own parents how to raise them. I\u2019m also astounded that the mother apologized to the child for her own oversight rather than the child apologizing for lying and planning expenditures that presumably the mother would be covering without asking her mother if those expenditures and plans were permissible. \nThis is just crazy. OP could have recognized and reconciled her own oversight without permitting the child to lie and dictate the terms of her own punishment. I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes. This practice simply doesn\u2019t scale up to a mature worldview. And this child totally runs the house. \nBring on the downvotes from the army of Reddit teens.", "Tell Paige she\u2019s not important. You already showed her that", "You're still TA here. \n\nPaige wanted to have her own party and be treated like her own person. By you assuming that Paige and Dylan would both want to have a joint party and would have to decide between themselves and then tell you otherwise, you were treating them as a unit and not as individuals. This put Paige in a position where, to get what she wants (independent party) she has to risk hurting her brother's feelings and disrupting his plans. So she opted to tell a lie about a decision, that should have been hers to make anyway, because it was easier than telling the truth. Why do you think that is?\n\nOpting straight to punishing her by taking away her autonomy was a bad move. It's good that you backpedaled on that, but you still haven't looked into why she felt the need to lie in the first place. In your comments, you mention you don't think it was deeply motivated; I don't think you're looking deep enough yourself. \n\nAlso, canceling a birthday party or grounding Paige is a disproportioned response to a white lie. Considering Paige and Dylan have worked this out themselves with 0 input from you (you don't even know how they worked it out!), the only reason for the punishment is lying about to get out of a situation that you put her in. You should take time to understand why she felt like she had to lie, rather than talk to you about it; punishing her without understanding that is only going to make her less likely to open up to you in the future.", "Honestly, if there's any message to be taken from this, it's that you need to get better at communicating with your children. \n\nIt sounds like if you'd just spoke to them both and seen both sides things would've gone a lot smoother. Paige just wanted more freedom but didn't feel like she could properly ask for it. Dylan didn't actually care about not getting the joint party he just wanted to at least be consulted first. It seems like this whole family just needs to learn how to communicate properly.\n\nHonestly, the actual \"punishment\" you should have gotten here is just sitting both twins down, have Paige apologise to Dylan and then smooth things out between them. Then just a slap on the wrist for Paige for lying. Maybe ask her to help out in preparing Dylan's party as a token gesture.", "\\> I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year.

I'm not sure you've fully grasped the lesson this situation is offering.", "Unless she always lie, I feel like a verbal warning would have been better, after all, she just didn't ask her brother what to do and lied about it. To me, it feels way too strict and feel like you want to force a punishment because you already did a bad punishment with the joint party.", "pretty great resolution.\n\nI'm glad you talked to them.  And it's funny that she felt you apologized for the \"wrong\" thing.", "I think this is one of the most controversial Reddit posts I\u2019ve seen so far this year, holy chalupa", "What does Dylan want to do for his party?", "Good job. Paige needed to know that lying isn't okay, especially when all she had to do was communicate with you or her brother. Glad it all worked out.", "No, the \"why\" behind Paige lying really wasn't that deeply motivated. She wasn't afraid that Dylan would be favored over her or that she wouldn't get what she wanted unless she lied, she just skipped talking to him about birthday plans for normal teenager reasons but then lied about it because she felt bad afterwards.", "Hell with that, Paige did nothing wrong in my view", " Why are you ignoring how her lies and manipulation made him feel? Why are you only throwing yourself into the perspective of the daughter?", "I really don\u2019t see being forced into a matching set in this story, and I speak as a twin. Most years they\u2019ve chosen to share a party, that\u2019s not unusual. Then Paige lied that she\u2019d already talked to her brother about it, which understandably hurt him. It sounded I\u2019m the original post that if she\u2019d either talked to him beforehand or told OP the truth, that she hadn\u2019t spoken to him yet, OP would have been just fine with that.", "I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes.

If the mom hadn't talked to the son, there's a good chance he'd have been left out to dry when the day itself came and he realized his sister wasn't there. These repliers have zero consideration for the brother or if he got hurt by his sister's lie. Her feelings should not only trump the brother's, but she did nothing wrong by deceiving him. It's narcissistic, but what teenager isn't? I'd have hoped those (presumably adult) repliers ITT would have grown out of it, though.", "These replies are wild.

How is there an expectation?", ">If she had talked to her brother and he had said he wants to share a party, would she still have been forced to have a joint party?\n\nNo, if this had happened then there wouldn't have been a joint party. In the past Paige and Dylan always happened to agree and both wanted the joint party, but if only one of them had then I wouldn't have made the other one go along with it.", "So giving her her own separate party like she wanted, is showing her she\u2019s not important?", "Did you read where Paige said \"her friends decided they wanted a girls party\" and she was only upset because she would be upsetting her friends by not having the party they wanted...\n\nPaige wasn't trying to exert her individuality.  She even said she didn't care if it was joint with her brother, she only cares that her friends would be disappointed.  OP isn't the asshole for grounding her child for lying.  Lying where the result cause someone to be emotionally hurt.  OP took the overly harsh criticism and reaching and talked to her children and everyone walked away happy.  Paige even said an appropriate punishment was being grounded!  She could have said more chores.  She could have said something confiscated.  Plus you don't even know the perameters of grounding.  It could have been lightly over a weekend.  Your making it sound like a grounding lasts weeks and is a terrible punishment to inflict on any child.", "A movie and laser tag, he found a place that offers a pizza party deal alongside the laser tag.", "> She wasn't afraid that Dylan would be favored over her\n\nIs she?

You're going to leave these kids on their own?

It's weird to me that they needed to run their potential bday plans by the other before they can make any plans for their own bday. Planning a kids bday is between the kid and the adult(s), not between the kids and THEN the adults. When kids feel they are backed into a corner, they don't have many options(or the mental capabilities to think of many) to come up with logical reactions so they'll typically lie or lash out. Paige went with lying instead of lashing out. Not that it matters now tho since the dynamic has obviously changed lol. I just hope her punishment is a token grounding and not a full fledged, several week punishment.

The daughter lies and says they both talked and wanted separate birthdays. \n\nOP was totally fine with separate parties, she wasn\u2019t fine learning that her children hadn\u2019t discussed it and Paige had lied saying they had. \n\nIt\u2019s sounds like if Paige had actually talked to her brother, he would have been fine with separate birthdays. Had she done that, none of this would have happened.", "What? OP didn't force anything, she asked a very normal question to ask people who share a birthday and got lied to. She tried to have an open conversation and got lied to. She gave them the *option* of sharing a party as they'd eagerly chosen to do so in the past.", ">OP created this situation by ASSUMING her two teenaged children would want to share a bday.\n\nThe OP never made this assumption. What she did do was ask her daughter what sort of Bday she wanted and the daughter chose to lie and say that she had talked to Dylan about it.\n\nSimple solution that doesn't require lying:\n\n\"I haven't spoken to Dylan, but I would really like to have a solo party this year\"\n\nInstead the daughter said:\n\n\"I've spoken with Dylan and we both want separate parties this year\"", ">her parent expected her to get her brother's permission to have a separate party\n\nThey never said that, they just wanted her to check in with her brother because they normally share birthdays\n\n>She knew if Dylan said he wanted to have a joint party, that is what would have happened.\n\nOh I didn't realize that you're like their cousin or uncle or something and that you know them personally. Cuz that is the only way you can say that because there is zero proof that is the situation. When you come here you're supposed to talk about what's actually in the post not the stuff that you're making up in your mind cuz that's how you think it's going to go based off your own personal history with your family.", "You seem very sure.", ">touch some grass\n\nOh boy. Take a breath, friend.", "From a person with reading comprehension, I agree with this statement. Good lord with these comments.", "No?", "Good lord, people are being unreasonable here. Yes, the shared birthday party was an incorrect punishment, but of course the lying needed punishing. Am I going crazy here? Do we need to make every single thing about gender?", "Couldn't ask for a better resolution.", "She\u2019s like \u2018well I changed the punishment from forcing them to share a party to grounding her so I\u2019m clearly a different person from a week ago\u2019", "> eagerly chosen to in the past \n\nWe must be reading different posts bc OP said herself they'd had separate parties in the past\n\nGood parents typically want to find out the root cause of a problem, not just blindly punish their kids without caring as to what made them behave differently. OP is acting like she exhausted all possible reasons why her daughter felt she had to lie by asking kiddo ONCE", "I think the guy didn\u2019t get his own party or something\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Seems you haven\u2019t learned much from this. \n\nI get the vibe she\u2019s being punished because you don\u2019t want to be the only one who was wrong in this situation. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "What would have happened if she had never lied?  What if Dylan wanted a joint party and Paige wanted a separate party, what would have happened?", "Her kid lied in a way that hurt her brother; that deserves punishment. OP *consulted* with the kid and they came to a punishment *the kid agreed* was fair.\n\nI dont get why you're railing on a good mom who made a mistake, asks for advice, and then *takes* that advise to amend the situation? like, what the everloving fuck do you want from her?\n\nFFS reddit is brutal sometimes.", "If you had read the original post, you would see where it said they had separate birthdays like twice prior. Before that they typically shared their birthdays. It's not that you guys are reading different posts, it's just that you're not actually paying attention to what you're reading, and making stuff up. The Root cause of the problem is that she lied to her parents about talking with her brother about them having separate birthdays. When they asked the son, the son said that never happened. When they confronted the daughter she confirmed that she lied. When asked why she lied, the reason is because she wanted to have a birthday party on her own without any boys and just her girlfriends. In essence you can say she lied because she wasn't mature enough to just tell her parents she wanted to have a birthday on her own and did not communicate that to her brother.", "Nope, same post. OP said they've chosen both.\n\nThis isn't \"Am I The Good Parent\", and obvi OP isn't one or she wouldn't be posting here. Based on what we know there *isn't* anything else OP can do yet without pushing her daughter away. Having her around could even give OP the opportunity to work on their relationship and talk to her daughter to try to find out what's going on. But I guess that would require, I dunno, not being some online rando who thinks that a child lying to get what they want is not the child's decision.", "Nope. In the original post they have chosen to do both separate parties and shared in the past. The norm is the siblings discuss it, OP asks what they decided to do, and they do that. OP asked her daughter what the plan was, and her daughter lied as a first option. The root problem was that her friends decided they didn\u2019t want boys at the party, so OP\u2019s daughter chose to lie and say they agreed to do a separate party. OP even [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130ng9c/update_aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_share_a/jhy23at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) that if Paige had just said that she didn\u2019t want a shared party even though her brother did groom the beginning, they would\u2019ve gotten separate parties.", ">I get the vibe she\u2019s being punished because you don\u2019t want to be the only one who was wrong in this situation.\n\nInteresting that you're getting that vibe. That doesn't even make sense to me.", "Then they would've had separate birthday parties.", "Because most people here are also assholes. That's why people like to come in and talk smack about other people being assholes.", "They really are. They got issues.", "> OP herself said they'd had separate parties in the past\n\nI litchrally said they'd had separate parties before?", "Because you didn\u2019t address the fact you obviously favor your son over your daughter \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She lied to remedy something you did that you admit was wrong. She did not trust you to be fair (and rightly so) and lying is a rational response when you don't trust someone.", "Right, it dose not make sense to you because you are grossly obtuse. Either deliberately obtuse or lacking the mental faculties to recognize when you are avoiding looking your mistakes in the eye. \n\nBut no one here can make you a better person, so honestly you should probably just stop engaging as you are not listening and this defensiveness seems like an exhausting exercise.", "That's just inaccurate, I don't favor Dylan over Paige.", ">She lied to remedy something you did that you admit was wrong. \n\nI think you have the order of events confused, actually."]}
