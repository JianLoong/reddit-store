Paige asked if that meant that she could still have the birthday party that she and her friends had planned. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because I still wasn\u2019t happy with her for lying to me in the first place. Paige said that she was more way upset about having to tell her friends that her party was cancelled than about having to share a party with Dylan, and that she didn\u2019t really get why I was apologizing for that instead. I asked Paige what she thought a more appropriate consequence for lying was instead of having her party cancelled, and she suggested getting grounded, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with. Lastly I told Paige that since I know she and Dylan are getting older now, I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year. Paige said that she only did this year because her friends decided they didn\u2019t want any boys. I told her that was fine and I guessed we\u2019d just talk about it again next year.\n\nAnd then I told Dylan that I was letting Paige have her all-girls party with her friends, and that I realized I shouldn\u2019t have used sharing a birthday party with him as a punishment because that wasn\u2019t fair to either one of them. Dylan said it was okay and that if he was having a solo party after all, he knew what he wanted to do for it. I also told Dylan that since he and Paige are getting older now, I\u2019d start assuming that they want separate parties unless they tell me otherwise. Dylan said he guessed that made sense.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much it, Dylan and Paige are each having their own party. And at some point they talked it out between themselves as far as Dylan\u2019s feelings being hurt that Paige hadn\u2019t talked to him about what she wanted to do this year, I wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation but they\u2019ve been friends again since it happened.", "created_utc": 1682604813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130ng9c/update_aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_share_a/", "score": 2458, "replies": ["I am glad it worked out, BUT I think you need to think about WHY she lied?

Sharing a birthday party, as a minor, is par for the course.\n\nIt isn't an egregious affront to individuality. It just often makes the most sense logistically and it also pays homage to the fact that they were born together.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule that says they have to share the same party, but lying and trying to manipulate your way into a separate party (without even discussing it with your twin) is a bullshit move.\n\nThere are multiple ways to address this situation, but it begins with open communication, not manipulative tactics, to get what you want.\n\n\nAs parents of a twin, it is important to support their individuality. It is also important to address unnecessarily manipulative behavior by any child.\n\nThrowing two separate parties is great, if you can pull it off both logistically and financially. \n\nIt is just as important to hammer home the message that honest communication is the best means with which to advocate for your needs and desires while balancing these against the needs and desires of the people you care about.\n\nIt is great that both children were ultimately happy with the solution. It just needs to be made clear that lying and manipulation aren't the best tools for getting what you want.", "Perfect in my opinion.", "I don\u2019t really understand why Paige is being punished for lying.

Neither is the concept that if one wants to share and the other doesn't, too bad so sad, you're sharing. \n\nI'd be more focused on the fact that she was afraid to be open than the fact that she lied. This isn't a pattern of behavior for her. Someone forced her hand here. She made a mistake, but let's not go crazy about it.", ">I missed your original post, but I think you were judged too harshly by the responses.\n\nThanks, I think so too.

She knowingly lied, knowingly hurt her brothers feelings\u2026because her friends told her to. Then she doubles down and gripes about her party being cancelled as a potential punishment\u2026because her friends will be upset with her. I\u2019m not loving her friends. I also think she\u2019s getting off super light here with being \u201cgrounded\u201d, though it\u2019s never expressed what that actually entails.", "I like a good success story. Way to make it right!", "Honestly you shouldn't ground her. \n\nYou created a really bad situation and yes she rebelled. When children sneak and lie it's usually due to fear, mistrust etc. You created an untrusting environment. Are you getting grounded for being an AH?\n\nMove on let her be.", "Here's a wild parenting philosophy: not every thing a kid does that's \"wrong\" needs a consequence/punishment. \n\nSometimes just talking about an issue calmly together can have a more meaningful impact. If another person has been hurt by a child's actions, making that up to them is a better approach.", "She shouldn't be punished. You need to take responsibility for creating that situation.", "It amazes me that parents these days are letting their kids have a democratic voice in their punishment at 14 years old as if a 14 y/o has any reasonable brain development to honestly tell their own parents how to raise them. I\u2019m also astounded that the mother apologized to the child for her own oversight rather than the child apologizing for lying and planning expenditures that presumably the mother would be covering without asking her mother if those expenditures and plans were permissible. \nThis is just crazy. OP could have recognized and reconciled her own oversight without permitting the child to lie and dictate the terms of her own punishment. I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes. This practice simply doesn\u2019t scale up to a mature worldview. And this child totally runs the house. \nBring on the downvotes from the army of Reddit teens.", "Tell Paige she\u2019s not important. You already showed her that", "You're still TA here. \n\nPaige wanted to have her own party and be treated like her own person. By you assuming that Paige and Dylan would both want to have a joint party and would have to decide between themselves and then tell you otherwise, you were treating them as a unit and not as individuals. This put Paige in a position where, to get what she wants (independent party) she has to risk hurting her brother's feelings and disrupting his plans. So she opted to tell a lie about a decision, that should have been hers to make anyway, because it was easier than telling the truth. Why do you think that is?\n\nOpting straight to punishing her by taking away her autonomy was a bad move. It's good that you backpedaled on that, but you still haven't looked into why she felt the need to lie in the first place. In your comments, you mention you don't think it was deeply motivated; I don't think you're looking deep enough yourself. \n\nAlso, canceling a birthday party or grounding Paige is a disproportioned response to a white lie. Considering Paige and Dylan have worked this out themselves with 0 input from you (you don't even know how they worked it out!), the only reason for the punishment is lying about to get out of a situation that you put her in. You should take time to understand why she felt like she had to lie, rather than talk to you about it; punishing her without understanding that is only going to make her less likely to open up to you in the future.", "Honestly, if there's any message to be taken from this, it's that you need to get better at communicating with your children. \n\nIt sounds like if you'd just spoke to them both and seen both sides things would've gone a lot smoother. Paige just wanted more freedom but didn't feel like she could properly ask for it. Dylan didn't actually care about not getting the joint party he just wanted to at least be consulted first. It seems like this whole family just needs to learn how to communicate properly.\n\nHonestly, the actual \"punishment\" you should have gotten here is just sitting both twins down, have Paige apologise to Dylan and then smooth things out between them. Then just a slap on the wrist for Paige for lying. Maybe ask her to help out in preparing Dylan's party as a token gesture.", "\\> I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year.

I'm not sure you've fully grasped the lesson this situation is offering.", "Unless she always lie, I feel like a verbal warning would have been better, after all, she just didn't ask her brother what to do and lied about it. To me, it feels way too strict and feel like you want to force a punishment because you already did a bad punishment with the joint party.", "pretty great resolution.\n\nI'm glad you talked to them.  And it's funny that she felt you apologized for the \"wrong\" thing.", "I think this is one of the most controversial Reddit posts I\u2019ve seen so far this year, holy chalupa", "What does Dylan want to do for his party?", "Good job. Paige needed to know that lying isn't okay, especially when all she had to do was communicate with you or her brother. Glad it all worked out.", "No, the \"why\" behind Paige lying really wasn't that deeply motivated. She wasn't afraid that Dylan would be favored over her or that she wouldn't get what she wanted unless she lied, she just skipped talking to him about birthday plans for normal teenager reasons but then lied about it because she felt bad afterwards.", "Hell with that, Paige did nothing wrong in my view", " Why are you ignoring how her lies and manipulation made him feel? Why are you only throwing yourself into the perspective of the daughter?", "I really don\u2019t see being forced into a matching set in this story, and I speak as a twin. Most years they\u2019ve chosen to share a party, that\u2019s not unusual. Then Paige lied that she\u2019d already talked to her brother about it, which understandably hurt him. It sounded I\u2019m the original post that if she\u2019d either talked to him beforehand or told OP the truth, that she hadn\u2019t spoken to him yet, OP would have been just fine with that.", "I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes.

If the mom hadn't talked to the son, there's a good chance he'd have been left out to dry when the day itself came and he realized his sister wasn't there. These repliers have zero consideration for the brother or if he got hurt by his sister's lie. Her feelings should not only trump the brother's, but she did nothing wrong by deceiving him. It's narcissistic, but what teenager isn't? I'd have hoped those (presumably adult) repliers ITT would have grown out of it, though.", "These replies are wild.

How is there an expectation?", ">If she had talked to her brother and he had said he wants to share a party, would she still have been forced to have a joint party?\n\nNo, if this had happened then there wouldn't have been a joint party. In the past Paige and Dylan always happened to agree and both wanted the joint party, but if only one of them had then I wouldn't have made the other one go along with it.", "So giving her her own separate party like she wanted, is showing her she\u2019s not important?", "Did you read where Paige said \"her friends decided they wanted a girls party\" and she was only upset because she would be upsetting her friends by not having the party they wanted...\n\nPaige wasn't trying to exert her individuality.  She even said she didn't care if it was joint with her brother, she only cares that her friends would be disappointed.  OP isn't the asshole for grounding her child for lying.  Lying where the result cause someone to be emotionally hurt.  OP took the overly harsh criticism and reaching and talked to her children and everyone walked away happy.  Paige even said an appropriate punishment was being grounded!  She could have said more chores.  She could have said something confiscated.  Plus you don't even know the perameters of grounding.  It could have been lightly over a weekend.  Your making it sound like a grounding lasts weeks and is a terrible punishment to inflict on any child.", "A movie and laser tag, he found a place that offers a pizza party deal alongside the laser tag.", "> She wasn't afraid that Dylan would be favored over her\n\nIs she?

You're going to leave these kids on their own?

It's weird to me that they needed to run their potential bday plans by the other before they can make any plans for their own bday. Planning a kids bday is between the kid and the adult(s), not between the kids and THEN the adults. When kids feel they are backed into a corner, they don't have many options(or the mental capabilities to think of many) to come up with logical reactions so they'll typically lie or lash out. Paige went with lying instead of lashing out. Not that it matters now tho since the dynamic has obviously changed lol. I just hope her punishment is a token grounding and not a full fledged, several week punishment.

The Root cause of the problem is that she lied to her parents about talking with her brother about them having separate birthdays. When they asked the son, the son said that never happened. When they confronted the daughter she confirmed that she lied. When asked why she lied, the reason is because she wanted to have a birthday party on her own without any boys and just her girlfriends.

She shouldn't have had to include her brother in the decision making, so I don't think it should have mattered if he had agreed to it.
