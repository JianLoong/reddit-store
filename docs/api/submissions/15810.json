Paige asked if that meant that she could still have the birthday party that she and her friends had planned. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because I still wasn\u2019t happy with her for lying to me in the first place. Paige said that she was more way upset about having to tell her friends that her party was cancelled than about having to share a party with Dylan, and that she didn\u2019t really get why I was apologizing for that instead. I asked Paige what she thought a more appropriate consequence for lying was instead of having her party cancelled, and she suggested getting grounded, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with. Lastly I told Paige that since I know she and Dylan are getting older now, I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year. Paige said that she only did this year because her friends decided they didn\u2019t want any boys. I told her that was fine and I guessed we\u2019d just talk about it again next year.\n\nAnd then I told Dylan that I was letting Paige have her all-girls party with her friends, and that I realized I shouldn\u2019t have used sharing a birthday party with him as a punishment because that wasn\u2019t fair to either one of them. Dylan said it was okay and that if he was having a solo party after all, he knew what he wanted to do for it. I also told Dylan that since he and Paige are getting older now, I\u2019d start assuming that they want separate parties unless they tell me otherwise. Dylan said he guessed that made sense.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much it, Dylan and Paige are each having their own party. And at some point they talked it out between themselves as far as Dylan\u2019s feelings being hurt that Paige hadn\u2019t talked to him about what she wanted to do this year, I wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation but they\u2019ve been friends again since it happened.", "created_utc": 1682604813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130ng9c/update_aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_share_a/", "score": 3978, "replies": ["I am glad it worked out, BUT I think you need to think about WHY she lied?

Sharing a birthday party, as a minor, is par for the course.\n\nIt isn't an egregious affront to individuality. It just often makes the most sense logistically and it also pays homage to the fact that they were born together.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule that says they have to share the same party, but lying and trying to manipulate your way into a separate party (without even discussing it with your twin) is a bullshit move.\n\nThere are multiple ways to address this situation, but it begins with open communication, not manipulative tactics, to get what you want.\n\n\nAs parents of a twin, it is important to support their individuality. It is also important to address unnecessarily manipulative behavior by any child.\n\nThrowing two separate parties is great, if you can pull it off both logistically and financially. \n\nIt is just as important to hammer home the message that honest communication is the best means with which to advocate for your needs and desires while balancing these against the needs and desires of the people you care about.\n\nIt is great that both children were ultimately happy with the solution. It just needs to be made clear that lying and manipulation aren't the best tools for getting what you want.", "Perfect in my opinion.", "I don\u2019t really understand why Paige is being punished for lying.

Neither is the concept that if one wants to share and the other doesn't, too bad so sad, you're sharing. \n\nI'd be more focused on the fact that she was afraid to be open than the fact that she lied. This isn't a pattern of behavior for her. Someone forced her hand here. She made a mistake, but let's not go crazy about it.", ">I missed your original post, but I think you were judged too harshly by the responses.\n\nThanks, I think so too.

Then she doubles down and gripes about her party being cancelled as a potential punishment\u2026because her friends will be upset with her. I\u2019m not loving her friends.

Way to make it right!", "Honestly you shouldn't ground her. \n\nYou created a really bad situation and yes she rebelled. When children sneak and lie it's usually due to fear, mistrust etc. You created an untrusting environment. Are you getting grounded for being an AH?\n\nMove on let her be.", "Here's a wild parenting philosophy: not every thing a kid does that's \"wrong\" needs a consequence/punishment. \n\nSometimes just talking about an issue calmly together can have a more meaningful impact. If another person has been hurt by a child's actions, making that up to them is a better approach.", "She shouldn't be punished. You need to take responsibility for creating that situation.", "It amazes me that parents these days are letting their kids have a democratic voice in their punishment at 14 years old as if a 14 y/o has any reasonable brain development to honestly tell their own parents how to raise them. I\u2019m also astounded that the mother apologized to the child for her own oversight rather than the child apologizing for lying and planning expenditures that presumably the mother would be covering without asking her mother if those expenditures and plans were permissible. \nThis is just crazy. OP could have recognized and reconciled her own oversight without permitting the child to lie and dictate the terms of her own punishment. I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes. This practice simply doesn\u2019t scale up to a mature worldview. And this child totally runs the house. \nBring on the downvotes from the army of Reddit teens.", "Tell Paige she\u2019s not important. You already showed her that", "You're still TA here. \n\nPaige wanted to have her own party and be treated like her own person. By you assuming that Paige and Dylan would both want to have a joint party and would have to decide between themselves and then tell you otherwise, you were treating them as a unit and not as individuals. This put Paige in a position where, to get what she wants (independent party) she has to risk hurting her brother's feelings and disrupting his plans. So she opted to tell a lie about a decision, that should have been hers to make anyway, because it was easier than telling the truth. Why do you think that is?\n\nOpting straight to punishing her by taking away her autonomy was a bad move. It's good that you backpedaled on that, but you still haven't looked into why she felt the need to lie in the first place. In your comments, you mention you don't think it was deeply motivated; I don't think you're looking deep enough yourself. \n\nAlso, canceling a birthday party or grounding Paige is a disproportioned response to a white lie. Considering Paige and Dylan have worked this out themselves with 0 input from you (you don't even know how they worked it out!), the only reason for the punishment is lying about to get out of a situation that you put her in. You should take time to understand why she felt like she had to lie, rather than talk to you about it; punishing her without understanding that is only going to make her less likely to open up to you in the future.", "Honestly, if there's any message to be taken from this, it's that you need to get better at communicating with your children. \n\nIt sounds like if you'd just spoke to them both and seen both sides things would've gone a lot smoother. Paige just wanted more freedom but didn't feel like she could properly ask for it. Dylan didn't actually care about not getting the joint party he just wanted to at least be consulted first. It seems like this whole family just needs to learn how to communicate properly.\n\nHonestly, the actual \"punishment\" you should have gotten here is just sitting both twins down, have Paige apologise to Dylan and then smooth things out between them. Then just a slap on the wrist for Paige for lying. Maybe ask her to help out in preparing Dylan's party as a token gesture.", "\\> I\u2019ll just assume going forward that they want to have separate parties every year.

I'm not sure you've fully grasped the lesson this situation is offering.", "Unless she always lie, I feel like a verbal warning would have been better, after all, she just didn't ask her brother what to do and lied about it. To me, it feels way too strict and feel like you want to force a punishment because you already did a bad punishment with the joint party.", "pretty great resolution.\n\nI'm glad you talked to them.  And it's funny that she felt you apologized for the \"wrong\" thing.", "I think this is one of the most controversial Reddit posts I\u2019ve seen so far this year, holy chalupa", "What does Dylan want to do for his party?", "Good job. Paige needed to know that lying isn't okay, especially when all she had to do was communicate with you or her brother. Glad it all worked out.", "No, the \"why\" behind Paige lying really wasn't that deeply motivated. She wasn't afraid that Dylan would be favored over her or that she wouldn't get what she wanted unless she lied, she just skipped talking to him about birthday plans for normal teenager reasons but then lied about it because she felt bad afterwards.", "Hell with that, Paige did nothing wrong in my view", "[removed]", "I really don\u2019t see being forced into a matching set in this story, and I speak as a twin. Most years they\u2019ve chosen to share a party, that\u2019s not unusual. Then Paige lied that she\u2019d already talked to her brother about it, which understandably hurt him. It sounded I\u2019m the original post that if she\u2019d either talked to him beforehand or told OP the truth, that she hadn\u2019t spoken to him yet, OP would have been just fine with that.", "I wonder what society would be like if adults dictated their own punishments for their crimes.

If the mom hadn't talked to the son, there's a good chance he'd have been left out to dry when the day itself came and he realized his sister wasn't there. These repliers have zero consideration for the brother or if he got hurt by his sister's lie. Her feelings should not only trump the brother's, but she did nothing wrong by deceiving him. It's narcissistic, but what teenager isn't? I'd have hoped those (presumably adult) repliers ITT would have grown out of it, though.", "These replies are wild. And it really concerns me how many people think that lying should be encouraged.", ">Do we need to make every single thing about gender?\n\nI don't fully understand how that became the main focus either.", "I think I skipped the lying part what did she lie about?", "I feel like I\u2019m going crazy too.

How is there an expectation?", ">If she had talked to her brother and he had said he wants to share a party, would she still have been forced to have a joint party?\n\nNo, if this had happened then there wouldn't have been a joint party. In the past Paige and Dylan always happened to agree and both wanted the joint party, but if only one of them had then I wouldn't have made the other one go along with it.", "So giving her her own separate party like she wanted, is showing her she\u2019s not important?", "Did you read where Paige said \"her friends decided they wanted a girls party\" and she was only upset because she would be upsetting her friends by not having the party they wanted...\n\nPaige wasn't trying to exert her individuality.  She even said she didn't care if it was joint with her brother, she only cares that her friends would be disappointed.  OP isn't the asshole for grounding her child for lying.  Lying where the result cause someone to be emotionally hurt.  OP took the overly harsh criticism and reaching and talked to her children and everyone walked away happy.  Paige even said an appropriate punishment was being grounded!  She could have said more chores.  She could have said something confiscated.  Plus you don't even know the perameters of grounding.  It could have been lightly over a weekend.

You're going to leave these kids on their own?

It's weird to me that they needed to run their potential bday plans by the other before they can make any plans for their own bday. Planning a kids bday is between the kid and the adult(s), not between the kids and THEN the adults. When kids feel they are backed into a corner, they don't have many options(or the mental capabilities to think of many) to come up with logical reactions so they'll typically lie or lash out. Paige went with lying instead of lashing out. Not that it matters now tho since the dynamic has obviously changed lol. I just hope her punishment is a token grounding and not a full fledged, several week punishment.

The Root cause of the problem is that she lied to her parents about talking with her brother about them having separate birthdays. When they asked the son, the son said that never happened. When they confronted the daughter she confirmed that she lied. When asked why she lied, the reason is because she wanted to have a birthday party on her own without any boys and just her girlfriends.

She shouldn't have had to include her brother in the decision making, so I don't think it should have mattered if he had agreed to it. Granted, it's still a lie but it's on the lowest rung of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What if OP never talked to the son and he didn\u2019t know they were having separate parties?

It\u2019s not a big lie or out of panic.", "If it were the boy lying to his mother and trying to cut his sister out\u2026you\u2019d be reaching for the torches and pitchforks.", "Oh my god. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23 Well, I suppose it's a brief change from her being the AH favouring Paige.\n\nOP, I'm sorry, you absolutely cannot win this one. It's actually not you, AITA has been absolutely batshit on this story.", "There are a lot of people on this thread who really want to make you the bad guy. I don\u2019t really see any bad guys in this story, just humans. You\u2019re doing great, mama.", "You don't fully understand a lot of things but don't put any effort in trying. I am glad you saw reason for now, but if you're already not inspiring confidence here, how can you expect your children to truly believe you have their back?", "I think it's more likely Paige wanted a solo party and simple assumed everyone else had the same idea", "Oh? You know them personally and feel qualified to make that judgement?", "Lying isn't that big of a deal, especially when it's used to spare someone's feelings. \n\nBut it didn't spare his feelings it meant that he was finding out from someone else which makes it seem so much worse because she didn't respect him enough to tell him herself. Its not like he wasn't going to find out about it at some point. This isn't like telling someone you like their shoes when you're actually not keen or something, she lied and as a direct result someone got hurt.\n\n No its not that big a deal because shes only 14 and it likely wasn't malicious just a bad misjudgement but also she does need some correction and consequences. I'm not sure I'd have gone with a grounding but I'd definitley have done more than ask for an apology. This is something she needs to learn early in life, even if the lies are small and mostly harmless it makes you less trustworthy and people will not want to deal with you if you get a reputation as a liars its her parents responsibility to teach her these basic life skills.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s more the parents fault for engineering this situation where the only way to not have to share a birthday party is to lie", "No, I wouldn't. It literally doesn't make a difference.", "Because lying has consequences. She made amends with the brother, but she lied to one of her parents.", "Well, it is Reddit- mostly people who either don\u2019t interact with others irl or teenagers, neither of which would give stellar parenting advice\u2026", "WTF are you saying ?", "But everything means something and has deeper levels. We need to understand why she lied *at the cosmic level*. /s", "People on Reddit can seriously be so rude and overstep their boundaries. I get that by posting on AITA you\u2019re putting yourself and the conflict on a platter to be picked apart by strangers. But I feel like people ask questions/see questions answered, then jump to their own conclusions anyway. We have no insight into OP\u2019s life beyond the context they provided/any answers to questions, that\u2019s what\u2019s fair game for discussion and anything else is none of our business. It\u2019s common courtesy on the Internet AND if this was an in-person conversation. The only exception is people who make very skewed posts, leave out key info, then argue in the comments because they\u2019re deluded and just want validation. That\u2019s not the case here.", "This is Reddit, home of the Angry Female Children(tm)!", "I am not concerned re lying, I am more concerned that OP needs to think about her relationship with both kids.   She seems like she favors the brother", "But that wasn\u2019t the situation. She could have said \u201cactually, I\u2019d like a separate party this year, I guess we should tell my brother that,\u201d and they would have had separate parties. The OP has done that before and has said that they wouldn\u2019t have had any problem with that.", "Everybody always says that, and everybody\u2019s always lying.", "Exacly.", "Yes. Daughter should not have been able to have her original planned party bc of her lies and mistreatment of her brother. Not a joint party.  Just actions have consequences and that is your fancy party is off. You can have a small thing with some friends.", ">has said in the replies that if they disagreed, she'd give them their own parties anyway\n\nIt sounds like the daughter didn't have that understanding", "I stand by what I said", "What? Why do you say she \"knows that mom will force her to have a joint birthday\"? She specifically says that they decide themselves whether they will have joint o separate parties. She punished her daughter not for wanting a separate party but for lying about having told her brother.", "She solved things with her brother, but her mistake wasn't only with him. She lied to one of her parents. Actions have consequences.", "That says a lot about some people's agenda", "It's that assuming the answer that the person wants and giving it despite the truth is lying. \n\nE.g. - \nMom: \"Did you finish your homework?\" \nKid, who knows mom wants it to be done, but hasn't yet completed the work: \"Yes.\"\n\nOr at least, this is how it works in my experience.", "You are mostly right. But please remember she\u2019s not an adult yet. She\u2019s not thinking as an adult now. It\u2019s probably first sensitive conversation she needed to have. The lie was easier and she didn\u2019t think that much into future. \nThat\u2019s the great opportunity to sit her down to explain and teach her how react in situations like this. That\u2019s the parenting moment. \nWhat the punishment teach her now? \n\u201cI got fought in lie so I am punished\u201d - so need a better lie next time. \nIt\u2019s her first time. Of course if she lies again then punish.", "Right? OP even said they had separated parties in the past. I don't get why people are assuming the girl lied cause she would get a negative response.", "IKR? It was made clear in the original story that they've had seperate parties before. But AITA got the bit between the teeth in the original and did everything up to and including making shit up to attack her.\n\nHowever, I am rather amused that *now* she's the AH for favouring *Paige*. By talking to her. As AITA demanded, albeit with more sackcloth and ashes.", "There is to many children on this sub that's the problem.", "I was friends with a boy girl twin set in secondary school and they always had joint parties. They were in the same class and had a lot of the same friends and were close. Also it doesn't sound like the mum did assume she asked the daughter what they wanted to do. I think it sounds more like the daughter didn't want to hurt the brothers feelings tbh by having the conversation where she'd have to say i don't wanna spend my birthday with you.", "She's 14, not 5. She knows what lies are and the impact they have.", "Sure. But it was probably the first time she was faced with the situation of uncomfortable talk and not wanting to hurt someone\u2019s feelings. \nBut if you want to punish your kids just for the sake of punishing sure go ahead. They\u2019ll just get better at lying so they won\u2019t get caught. \nFor your example with stealing. Well yes they got caught so they are punished. But sometimes, they just get a warning if it\u2019s the first time. So yes, no \u201creal\u201d punishment. Additionally it they are NOT caught, does it mean it was worth it? \nWouldn\u2019t it be better to just sit and talk with your kid? So next time she will find a better way to not hurt her brother instead of just coming with a better lie?", "Of course 14yo don't have the ability to communicate that well but if they aren't directed and taught that things like lying are hurtful and wrong then they'll never gain that skill. Being punished for lying is one way in which people learn that so long as the reasoning is explained about the punishment which it sounds like OP has done now.", "You seriously grounded her? Wow still YTA. You\u2019re acting like she lied about an assault or something serious. It\u2019s a fucking birthday party \u2026\u2026..  A simple talk should have sufficed, plus she made up with her brother. Grounding is such an overkill for no reason.", "I don\u2019t know if anyone brought this up before, but I share a birthday with my cousin and we had a joint family party and then separate friend parties.", "I'm happy to see this resolved. I'm still concerned about the fact that Dad thought canceling a party is appropriate punishment for lying about one conversation when she told the truth about how she wanted to spend her birthday. That grounding is appropriate for that?  Instead of grounding did you ask her why? \n\nPossibly, she found her way to tell her truth because saying, I'm 14, my friends are the same age and we understand what boys around that age may never, we don't want to talk about farts, boners, and things like that could have been embarrassing or created a situation.  We'd like a space of comfort and plus, it's hard to look at boys when you have your brother with you. \n\nPlease, pay attention to what your kids *don't* say throughout the upcoming years. Sons and daughters are not the same and there are already large growth and hormonal separations between them.", "This update is so refreshingly mundane that it must be real! In all seriousness, though, good job, OP!", "I am glad it worked out but concerned that Paige's reason is her friends wanted it and she didn't want to disappoint them.  Be careful how much influence they have over her", "Bro you can\u2019t let your kid decide their punishment lmao they\u2019re not your equal they are a child", "I just don\u2019t understand why people think that just because kids are born at the same time they are the same people. I\u2019m 18 months younger than my sister and my mom treated us as twins. I absolutely hated it. I acted out to have my own identity. I moved 2500 miles away the first chance I got. \n\nOP, I\u2019m glad you learned. Im sad it took all this for you to realize that sharing a birthday doesn\u2019t mean you share everything.", "As a triplet, thank you for giving them their own party. I didn't have that until I was an adult.", "What\u2019s YOUR punishment for being a bad mother making your daughter and son share a party? You grounded your daughter. What about you?", "This little white ass lie doesn\u2019t deserve grounding. A talk and making up with her brother should have sufficed\u2026\u2026 id hate to have any of you guys as parents.", "She probably lied to you because she knew how you\u2019d react. You\u2019re still TA.", "> she just skipped talking to him about birthday plans\n\nDid Dylan do the same?", "I feel like she might just be maturing a bit faster than her brother, and wanted her mom to break the news.", "She\u2019s 13 years old.  This is the time of her life where she needs to learn honesty and integrity.  The lie itself doesn\u2019t matter in the long run, but this is the age that kids develop their internal moral compass.  She needs to know that lies = bad.  \n  \nWhen she\u2019s an adult, she can make further decisions about when and why she wants to fudge the truth, and when it\u2019s justified and when it\u2019s not.  It still wasn\u2019t in this case though.  She was obviously going to be found out and benefit nothing from it.", "Lots of projection here.", "Kinda easy to say this when you don't have a 14 year old. They are not the most logical creatures.", "I also think I would have done the same, just not asked my brother and told my parents I did. Source: I did this all the time (yeah mom, Luke said I can pick the movie tonight. Yeah, no he's fine with it)", "> to specifically exclude someone\n\nIt wasn't setup to exclude Dylan.  It was to exclude all boys.  I'd think a parent of a 14 year old girl would be happy about this.", "Do you not have siblings? As an older sister when I was a young teen I would purposely leave my brother out of things, and it would obviously hurt his feelings, lying about talking to someone about them not being included isn\u2019t okay. Doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t want them to ruin your activity. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being acknowledged before it becomes a habit of doing.", "Why gives a shit what you think with your garbage responses?", "She knows lying is bad. 5 year old know lying is bad. To be grounded over a silly ass situation like this is truly wild. A serious talk would do all that you just said. She doesn\u2019t need to be grounded over this, I stand by that.

So so true, too many factors.", "Teenagers really are overgrown toddlers developmentally, they test boundaries, they test lies, and they test social norms, just on a bigger scale. They really do just lie sometimes, for no bigger reason than its easier. Theyre just more sophisticated about it... usually", "I'm an adult and I still occasionally lie when I think it's easier (e.g. I'm always \"busy\" when someone invites me to church). I've just gotten better at knowing when lying is actually easier versus just postponing a problem.", "Like, tell me you don't remember being 14 without telling me.", "No trust me as a preteen or young teen you start bending the rules to see what you can and can\u2019t do, I\u2019m glad the mother is stopping that before it becomes a habit. She should be considerate of her brother when making decisions that also effect him", "Something tells me you are very young.  Grounding is barely a punishment.  It\u2019s a slap on the wrist.  It\u2019s nothing.", "A lot of teenagers lie from panic also.  I wasn\u2019t expecting this question so I shall make up something wild.", "Oh they realize.  It's just more expedient in the moment...path of least resistance.", "No, the responses are a bunch of ridiculous projection, plus a large percentage are teenagers themselves that side with a teenager regardless of facts.", "Unreasonable what? She lied and basically left her brother out of the party without talking to him about it, do you not have siblings who want to be with you?", "Hell, this is even a thing as adults still. I regularly tell my parents I don't need help with taxes or saving because I know if I say I do, the phone call will immediately become four hours longer.", "And the original punishment was unreasonable. They talked it out. Did you not read the update?", "You clearly aren\u2019t a good sibling then, you need to discuss things which will effect someone else, nonetheless their feelings. The day of the party could\u2019ve came and he wouldn\u2019t have known they were having separate parties. There isn\u2019t no deeper meaning to it other than the sister lying because she wanted the party and didn\u2019t want to talk to her brother about it. You need to work on your social skills and being considerate of others", "And full of questions that are inappropriate. Questions that if you ask them, you probably get grounded for even at a not so tender age? Yep. The struggle is real.", "I\u2019m shocked at how many people here are defending and supporting lying, manipulation, and social exclusion. \n\nNot even exaggerating, this is stunning. I really hope those people aren\u2019t parents because these same people aren\u2019t going to bother to teach their kids why that\u2019s wrong because they think it\u2019s perfectly fine to do.", "I don't know why everyone is targeting you so badly even after the resolution. You made a mistake and fixed it. It sounds like both your children ended up with an outcome they're happy with and you made sure Paige understood that lying wasn't ok.\n\nBeing a parent is super hard and it seems like you're trying your best to make sure they are appreciated but well rounded.

Grounding really seems like an extreme when the whole thing was a \u201cteachable moment\u201d but instead became a punishment. Idk. I\u2019m not part of the family but I feel like grounding was a bit overboard when it seems like this family doesn\u2019t know how to communicate. Poor girl just wanted to have a party and at 14 it\u2019s hard as hell to balance peer pressure and becoming an individual.
