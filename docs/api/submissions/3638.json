I may just be petty but honestly I think if people make insensitive remarks they deserve any 'trauma dumping' that comes their way as a result, Sam should treat it as a learning opportunity and check himself next time. Years ago when I was in university I was really struggling financially putting myself through uni because of my family situation and background. The uni was in a wealthy area and most of the other students were local, from privileged backgrounds and being funded by their parents. One night I was sat having dinner with a group of friends who were nagging me to go out with them, I said I couldn't afford it, one of the guys said \"Come on stop being a baby, why can't you just ask your dad for more money?\" So I said \"because I don't have one\". Yes things got awkward fast, no I didn't regret it, then or now. And he was a nice guy who was just young and being thoughtless, Sam sounds like a racist, pretentious dick.

She should be the one apologizing to you.", "NTA - maybe this will make Sam think twice before doing something like this again. Sarah and Sam are the assholes here and honestly your other friends kinda are, too, for getting upset at you over it.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nHe thought he was being clever and funny by correcting you, but instead he was rude and condescending.
