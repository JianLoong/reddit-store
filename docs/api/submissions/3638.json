The uni was in a wealthy area and most of the other students were local, from privileged backgrounds and being funded by their parents.

Sarah is mad her boyfriend acted like a racist AH, which led to him also being a callous AH due to circumstances he knew nothing about, and then he got called out in it. She's embarrassed and it's easier to take it out on you. Sounds like she may also be a ring leader in the group if everyone is agreeing, because frankly she is 100% incorrect here.", "NTA. Sounds like your friend is trying to maintain her relationship with her BF and is worried more about his feelings than being there for you. You are not in the wrong at all.", "Sam sounds like an entitled mainsplainer asshole and Sarah should be embarrassed about being associated to him. \nYour sentence was perfectly correct, but he was clearly looking for excuses to pick on you.

I have friends from Countries around the world and yes sometimes words can get mixed up! \n\nYep, these conversations can be a lot of fun, sometimes they can be confusing when words get muddled. But the fact its all part of the conversation and like your other friends are able to follow what you are saying I can with my friends.\n\nNow when I meet anyone new and English isn't their first language I certainly wouldn't be calling them out if they said something where possibly it wasn't the right word or used in context!\n\nI mean as English is my first (and only language) I certainly make me mistakes! I wouldn't call someone out if this was the 1st or 5th time of meeting them!\n\nIf I was confused by what was said I may have spoke to the person who knows them best, but let's be honest on the whole some conversations are just that!

He was being petty and knew it and unfortunately for him, the correction of his assumption included finding out about your mother passing. Your \u201cfriend\u201d Sarah is also an AH for not only letting her bf slide on his pettiness but then acting like you did something wrong.

It's one of my favorite things when someone says something about \"your mama\" and I get to pull out the \"well she would be she dead\" card. \n\nI hate grammar nazis, (reformed one myself) and you did not trauma dump.

Anyone at that table could have diffused the tension but they let the burden be on you.", "That\u2019s not what trauma dumping is. Sarah\u2019s not a very good friend. NTA", "NTA! Maybe Sam should choose HIS words a bit more carefully instead of worrying about correcting others.", "NTA.

And why was is okay for him to \u201ccorrect\u201d you and not you him?", "NTA, and neither is Sam. Sarah is for making a big deal about it and blaming you. What Sam said is a very common joke in English because even English speakers often make this grammatical mistake. It's the same as when someone asks \"can I...\" Instead of \"may I...\" And someone responds with, \"I don't know, *can you?*\" But this also got mixed with a \"yo mamma\" joke where the person's mom is dead. Sam's mistake was making a teacher/dad joke to the wrong person. Sarah made the situation worse instead of fixing it.", "NTA.

His GF is just trying to cover for his terrible behavior. NTA", "Definitely NTA. I once had someone ask me something similar, since I said my dad was from Texas. My response was 'Well he's dead, so everything about him is past tense.\"", "NTA and what in the world is Sarah going on about that is most definitely NOT trauma dumping. OP Sam and Sarah were extremely rude. They need to get a grip. I am genuinely sorry for your loss. Get new friends as well. The ones you have think acknowledging death is too much? SMDH.", "NTA. You weren't trauma dumping and this isn't even a grammar situation. I am a native speaker and I say the same thing, my dad was a nurse, he was white (as I explain my biracial background to people). He died over ten years ago so he's neither of those things now.", "As someone with a similar situation in most aspects (Mom died when I was 5, English is my 3rd language), I can definitely say you are well within your rights to do what you did. This wasn't trauma dumping, this was subtle mastery of the English language. Sam was being a smartass, you deflated him, then Sarah got upset. I'm willing to bet that nobody else at that tsble had lost a parent at an early age. So they really can't judge you, their reference framework is biased.

This asshole tried to mansplain her grammar and was embarrassed he was SO wrong so tried to throw it back on her. Add on that he's pretty racist for making assumptions about her background.

Absolutely NTA", "One of my other friends apologized to me this morning, but everyone else still thinks I could have just let it go instead of making things awkward.", "You must be sarah or one of her other friends.", "I\u2019m really sorry that happened to you. I\u2019m sorry you lost your mom so young. Also sorry that your friend is kind of a jerk. \n\nAt 19 I probably would have stayed friends with someone like her. Now I definitely wouldn\u2019t.

That was such a jerk thing to do, I\u2019m glad OP said what they did!! Sarah\u2019s reaction is concerning, as well as the other friends agreeing with her.

It just goes to show how \"much\" Sam really knows about English.\n\nAnd you can take THAT back to your friends :).", "So, being rude to people he doesn't know is a hobby of his? Hard pass.

Only in that their source is latin, but they are two very distinct languages. I'm Portuguese and I do speak Spanish, having learned it from very good Spanish friends.
