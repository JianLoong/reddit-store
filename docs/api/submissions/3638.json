The uni was in a wealthy area and most of the other students were local, from privileged backgrounds and being funded by their parents.

I'm sure he wouldn't have corrected you if you were white and had no accent.", "NTA\nI'm so sorry for your loss, the pain never goes away...\nAlso had my mom pass away in my teenage years. The way you shift your language (say parent instead of parents, always refer to dad/mom depending on who is still alive etc) in order to not draw attention and at the same time stay true to reality is a real thing.\n\nAlso, people who lost a parent immedietly recognize that language when talking to someone else with just one parent left alive.", "NTA.

He did not need to 'correct' you, and certainly not laugh while doing that.  Seems to me he wanted to put you down so he could think he was the big man.

But that's what your friends bf is. He was being a condescending little prick and now your friend feels embarrassed and everyone else also has second hand embarrassment because they all know he fucked up by being a nasty jerk and saying some unnecessary shit.

Of course it\u2019s easier to be mad at you and paint you as unreasonable because she wants to stay with her bf and acknowledging his wrongdoings makes it hard for her to keep up the fantasy that he\u2019s not a jerk.
