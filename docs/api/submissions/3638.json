Seriously, you have to be a blooming idiot to not err on the side of caution with that one. \n\nSarah is being a jerk, too. I would be mortified if a partner of mine behaved so stupidly.", "NTA.   Some people really love to embarrass you publicly,  and they really hate it when the attempt backfires and it THEY get embarrassed publicly.  In the words of our national treasure, James Brown:  \"Don't start none, won't be none.\"", "NTA.\nThat's a trauma dump? No. \nThat's what's called correcting an assumption.\nThat's what he gets for being unnecessarily pedantic.", "NTA. Sarah is not your friend. She should be mad at her boyfriend if she's going to be mad at anyone here. She also didn't even need to get mad. She could've just apologized to you for her boyfriend putting you in an awkward position and let the conversation move on. Although really he should've apologized. But instead she's mad at you for...having trauma in your life. You didn't even say anything beyond the simple fact that your mom died. Sarah makes no sense. She has no good argument here. She just felt embarrassed and lashed out and now is doubling down. Maybe ask a mutual friend to check in with her that she isn't acting this way because she's afraid of her boyfriend taking out his embarrassment on her, like maybe he's abusive and she's scared to do anything but defend his ego, but otherwise she's just being awful. And even if her boyfriend is abusive, that doesn't mean you have to tolerate her treating you so cruelly.", "NTA, I think what is key here is that you are all young and probably not super experienced at handling uncomfortable situations. It is likely that everyone recognised that Sam was being an AH and you were just stating facts, but they also know that it was YOU who said the thing that turned the conversation tense and have misattributed fault to you because of it.", "NTA\n\nThat's not trauma dumping that's literally you explaining why you used the word 'was' instead of 'is'. You have awful friends..Sarah being the worst of them.", "NTA. Sam was trying to be a smartass and it went over like a ton of bricks. You responded the only way you could. Now your \"friends\" are victim blaming. They each owe you an apology for their part in it. You in no way ruined the lunch.", "NTA - sarah obviously doesn\u2019t know what trauma dumping is, or she\u2019s just a really inconsiderate \u201cfriend\u201d. you have nothing to apologize for love", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. You didn\u2019t trauma dump however, both Sam and Sarah owe you apologies.", "NTA. Get better friends", "I never understand this scenario.\n\nWhy is ok for Sam to \"correct\" you, but not ok for you to correct him back?", "You have most certainly NOT messed up and I would seriously consider your relationship with Sarah. \n\nWhat a foul thing to say to someone who lost their mum so young. \n\nWhatever you were doing, and as far as I know 'trauma dumping is not a thing in the UK, it seems to me that this was far from being an example of it. You were simply correcting an inappropriate comment from sneering weasel who was probably trying to make himself look intelligent in front of a crowd. He failed, as did your (hopefully) former friend.\n\nDon't back down, don't apologise and look further afield in an effort to find a group of people that will really be your friends.", "Seriously.  He was trying to be smarter than her by \u201ccorrecting\u201d her English.  She corrected his assumption.  Normal reaction is \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d and everyone moves on.  Sarah is not a good friend.  OP is NTA.", "When you have a \u201cforeign\u201d accent it just means you speak more than one language. This guy was being an ass trying to belittle you by correcting grammar. Whenever an adult corrects another adults grammar they are in the wrong. He heard you with your accent assumed you were \u201cstupid\u201d and wanted you to know he knew you didn\u2019t belong there. He\u2019s a major AH. And to be honest a little racist, he understood your connotation but wanted to make himself superior. Good for you for correcting him, he should feel uncomfortable he\u2019s an ass.", "Plus if mother was still alive and lived in US, then she WAS from Brazil she IS now from Texas or florida or whatever.    \nFor instance I live in a location different from where I was born, I don't ever reference the birth location unless I am saying I was born in X. or I lived in X when I was young.", "Really like this retort(re: second language)", "Also had a parent due when I was a kid, and, yeah, people correcting you for using the wrong tense when describing them sucks hard. Nope, used the past tense on purpose, thanks for drawing attention to it in the most awkward way possible. Your choice was either to lie about your mother passing away, or correct him. You chose wisely.", "He's not an English major who does a \"thing\", he's a AH who likes to try & make himself feel important by belittling other people. Maybe you can correct Sarah's pronunciation with my correction?", "I\u2019m very particular about grammar. I would have been, therefore, happy to know that *was* was the correct usage in this case because your Brazilian mother is deceased.\n\nPeople who only care about the correctness of the grammar have no problem with being corrected themselves. Because it\u2019s all about what word is right, not what person is right.\n\nSam just likes being right and is butthurt that he was shown to be wrong. He\u2019ll live.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who condescendingly corrects someone who\u2019s first language isn\u2019t English is automatically an asshole in my book. \n\nSorry for your loss, OP", "Oh, so he\u2019s one of THOSE insufferable AHs\n\nI always scored well in English, grammar, and spelling (fight me about the Oxford comma).  However I don\u2019t feel then need to correct people - spoken and even written English is way less formal nowadays.  Especially with the advent of text speak.\n\nAnd spelling is hard.  My brother struggled a lot as a kid where I excelled with spelling and reading.  So it taught me a lot of patience with people.\n\nMy partner doesn\u2019t have the best grammar or spelling, but as long as I can figure out via context clues what he\u2019s actually trying to say in a message, I\u2019m not pressed.\n\nOnly AHs feel the need to correct people on every little thing.", "so he fucks around on the regular and this was his turn to find out\n\nNTA having a dead parent can be just a fact about you, it\u2019s not your fault that it makes other people uncomfortable", "He's an English major who doesn't know why people get referred to in the past tense? I think the true explanation is that being an oblivious asshole I'd \"a thing he does\" and your \"friend\" has gotten used to defending him and making excuses for his behavior. NTA", "I teach college English -- correcting people is entirely unnecessary (and classiest and racist, on top of being cruel). And he was wrong, to boot! You're in the right! He sucks!", "He's a pedantic AH you mean?", "Yeah I've got a degree in English studies and nope, he's just being pretentious. Anyone who's done extensive study of English knows how absolutely convoluted it is. We literally added in words and rules from latin and other romance languages because at one point germanic languages were considered 'ugly.' \n\nI have SO much respect for anyone who learned English as a second/third/fourth etc. language!  It's HARD and illogical!  \nCorrecting someone who hasn't specifically asked for help with their language is incredibly rude, and you weren't even incorrect! He owes YOU an apology, but I wouldn't expect to get one. He was trying to make himself look/feel superior by belittling your language skills, and is probably the type who can never admit that they're wrong. (I bet he doesn't even speak a language other than English).", "I was an English major.\n\nAt Berkeley... which is currently tied with Yale for #1 English program in the country.

He needs to get over himself.", "Correcting someone's grammar is just rude and lacking in manners. He should have apologized on the spot. Too bad Sarah thinks this behavior is acceptable. You had a right", "but he's wrong, she isn't from brazil, she doesn't \"is\" anymore", "I like your dad.", "There\u2019s also a lot of different dialects of English. There\u2019s different grammar and different spelling. Language is complicated and languages are alive and English is not Icelandic with one official correct", "and I wonder how many languages Sam speaks. OP mentioned 3 (and no, Portuguese and Spanish are not that closely related; handling both is a feat). I am so impressed with people who handle more than one. \n\nAnd OP, NTA. Your response was factual and perfect.", "I mean, technically speaking English does have one correct form, it's just that no one in any part of any English-speaking region speaks that form because we all have well-developed dialects.
