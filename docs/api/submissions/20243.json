{"id": 20243, "submission_id": "14fapee", "title": "AITA for insisting that my boyfriend and I sleep in the same bed whilst staying at my parents?", "selftext": "So I (22F) am the eldest of 6 with siblings who are 19, 15, 13 and 10 year old twins. The 19 yo is at uni in another city some distance away. My parents unexpectedly need to go to visit relatives abroad and have asked if I can look after the kids for a week. This is generally fine except 1 day I'm attending a course in another city. I will have to leave my parents house at around 6.40am and won't return until 7 or 8pm. Luckily my bf, who I live with, is off that day and is happy to help. When I told my Mother this she was incredibly appreciative of it and I thought nothing more about it.\n\nWell fast forward to today, two days before they leave, and my Mum asks if bf is ok about getting up so early to get out here (we live in the city, parents out in the suburbs about an hour by bus). I tell her that that's ok, he'll just come through the night before. To say my Mother freaked out is an understatement.\u00a0\n\nMum: 'and where exactly will he be sleeping?'\n\nMe: 'on the pull out, with me'\n\nMum: 'absolutely not! not under my roof!'\n\nNow to be clear, when my bf and I first started dating, on the couple of occasions we did visit my parents together, we did sleep in separate rooms however, my parents always said that that was just because they didn't know him and earlier this year, before we were living together, my entire family rented an Airbnb for a wedding and there were zero issues about me and my bf sharing. Not only was it not a big deal but my Mum specifically did the room arrangements and put us together herself, without any discussion from me so I was pretty blindsided by this reaction today.\n\nI checked the timetable and he'd need to get the bus just after 5am to guarantee he'd be there before I had to leave and presumably my Mother was also expecting him to leave once I returned that night meaning he'd potentially be getting home around 10pm. That is a ridiculously long day imho and far too big an expectation for someone who is doing you a favour. I advised my Mum as such and reminded her about the Airbnb and the fact that WE ALREADY LIVE TOGETHER and she reiterated that 'there will be none of that under my roof'. For the record, the couch is in the living room which has no closable doors, just open archways to the hallway and dining room. As such, there is ZERO chance that we'll be doing anything 'scandalous' over those two nights. I told her this but she still maintained that it's 'her house so her rules'. I told her that I felt my terms were more than fair and if she didn't like them then should find someone else for the week and hung up.\n\nShe's been texting calling me selfish and how this now means she'll need to stay behind and that I hope I'm proud of myself. I made it clear that it really doesn't mean that, there's a pretty easy fix here.\u00a0\n\nEdit 1: Apologies, I deleted a bit for word count but the pullout is my parent's bed.  It's in a little recess in the corner.  They downsized last year.  It's a 2 bedroom and the other rooms are already crowded with my siblings and we'd have to sleep on the floor which I'm also unwilling to do", "created_utc": 1687361138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fapee/aita_for_insisting_that_my_boyfriend_and_i_sleep/", "score": 866, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then 15 and 13 would only need to look after them for a few hours and take care of themselves.", "Thank you for the clarification.\n\nYou are right, I was wrong: it was at least 5 times.\n\nWell, I guess, 5 times is acceptable, 6 would not have been.\n\nLISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER, YOUNG GIRL!", "I always think when someone leaves out an important detail and then casually adds it in they\u2019re the AH. \n\nI\u2019ve also never heard of a homeowner or parent letting a couple use their bed.", "Then don't go help.\n\nYour options are: \ngo by her rules and boyfriend doesn't come with you. \n\nGo by her rules and boyfriend has to be majorly inconvenienced\n\nOr Don't go help at all.", "Then NTA. If this were from certain conservative Asian or Euro cultures, religious subsets, then yeah, sleeping in the same bed as your bf while in your parents' house is a very disrespectful thing to do. But since this is a white household, sleeping in the same bed shouldn't even matter. Having sex with said bf under the mom's nose is a different story.", "It is her house & her rules but you have EVERY RIGHT to say no to her.  She\u2019s being ridiculous.  If he was being paid, id understand but you\u2019re going well out of your way (literally & metaphorically) to help her & it\u2019s not enough.", "Exactly. Beggars can't be ~~mortality police~~ choosers. It would be one thing if they were doing you both a favor by letting you stay there. In that case it would be a \"their house, their rules\" situation. But your mom is asking you and your boyfriend to do HER a favor. That combined with the fact that you live with this person and the fact that you aren't about to get down and dirty in an open living room, make Mom super irrational. \n\nBut if those are her rules, those are her rules. She can't get upset if you do her the favor of following them by backing out. NTA", "My rules isn't a get of jail free card for being an AH.

Sex is just for making babies. Duh.", "Exactly. The 15 year old is qualified to watch the other two for 12 hours one time lol\n\nI don\u2019t think these parents really have their priorities straight.", "> why it is such a big thing for a 15, 13 and two 10 year olds to be home alone on one day for around 12 hrs?\n\n\nGiven how OP's mom reacted to her sharing a bed with her LIVE-IN BF, I am guessing the kids might be coddled or sheltered and might not have the skills to care for themselves for a day.  \n\nI'm just guessing here, of course, but helicopter/curling parents ruin a lot of kids.", "I mean it should be pretty easy to say something like \"your sister is living with her BF, until you are doing the same you don't get the same treatment\".

The problem is also with reddit having a word limit in posts.\nYou're basically saying that you will consider someone an AH based on their judgement of what is important,.not based on the merits of the story.\n\nIf there is only one bed available, do you really know people who will make their housesitter/babysitter/petsitter sleep on the floor instead?\n\nYou have still not mentioned one reason why OO is an AH though. Their mother is making an unreasonable request but they respect it and don't put up a fight. What makes OP an AH?", "that's essentially her post, asking if she is the asshole for not doing the favor because of the mother rules, she is not asking what she should do.", "You let family stay together.\n\nEither he's family, so he can stay the night, or he's not family, so he doesn't have to help.", "And there\u2019s where some would agree.
