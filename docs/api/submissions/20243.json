{"id": 20243, "submission_id": "14fapee", "title": "AITA for insisting that my boyfriend and I sleep in the same bed whilst staying at my parents?", "selftext": "So I (22F) am the eldest of 6 with siblings who are 19, 15, 13 and 10 year old twins. The 19 yo is at uni in another city some distance away. My parents unexpectedly need to go to visit relatives abroad and have asked if I can look after the kids for a week. This is generally fine except 1 day I'm attending a course in another city. I will have to leave my parents house at around 6.40am and won't return until 7 or 8pm. Luckily my bf, who I live with, is off that day and is happy to help. When I told my Mother this she was incredibly appreciative of it and I thought nothing more about it.\n\nWell fast forward to today, two days before they leave, and my Mum asks if bf is ok about getting up so early to get out here (we live in the city, parents out in the suburbs about an hour by bus). I tell her that that's ok, he'll just come through the night before. To say my Mother freaked out is an understatement.\u00a0\n\nMum: 'and where exactly will he be sleeping?'\n\nMe: 'on the pull out, with me'\n\nMum: 'absolutely not! not under my roof!'\n\nNow to be clear, when my bf and I first started dating, on the couple of occasions we did visit my parents together, we did sleep in separate rooms however, my parents always said that that was just because they didn't know him and earlier this year, before we were living together, my entire family rented an Airbnb for a wedding and there were zero issues about me and my bf sharing. Not only was it not a big deal but my Mum specifically did the room arrangements and put us together herself, without any discussion from me so I was pretty blindsided by this reaction today.\n\nI checked the timetable and he'd need to get the bus just after 5am to guarantee he'd be there before I had to leave and presumably my Mother was also expecting him to leave once I returned that night meaning he'd potentially be getting home around 10pm. That is a ridiculously long day imho and far too big an expectation for someone who is doing you a favour. I advised my Mum as such and reminded her about the Airbnb and the fact that WE ALREADY LIVE TOGETHER and she reiterated that 'there will be none of that under my roof'. For the record, the couch is in the living room which has no closable doors, just open archways to the hallway and dining room. As such, there is ZERO chance that we'll be doing anything 'scandalous' over those two nights. I told her this but she still maintained that it's 'her house so her rules'. I told her that I felt my terms were more than fair and if she didn't like them then should find someone else for the week and hung up.\n\nShe's been texting calling me selfish and how this now means she'll need to stay behind and that I hope I'm proud of myself. I made it clear that it really doesn't mean that, there's a pretty easy fix here.\u00a0\n\nEdit 1: Apologies, I deleted a bit for word count but the pullout is my parent's bed.  It's in a little recess in the corner.  They downsized last year.  It's a 2 bedroom and the other rooms are already crowded with my siblings and we'd have to sleep on the floor which I'm also unwilling to do", "created_utc": 1687361138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fapee/aita_for_insisting_that_my_boyfriend_and_i_sleep/", "score": 2771, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You backing out because of this is a bit of an YTA ... not even e s h ... because she is well within her rights to not want this in her home, you are being a good daughter sitting for her within your constraints, and it is up to her to make arrangements for the days you can't.  \n\nThis puts her morals squarely against her convenience ... with my mom, convenience won out :-)", "And she can find other childcare! Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, and the accommodation she expects is extreme!  She can pay someone or suck it the eff up!", "I\u2019m thinking you didn\u2019t read the whole post.  You\u2019d really ask this person\u2019s boyfriend to make the journey he\u2019d have to make in order to do her mother a favor? These people LIVE TOGETHER.  Nah, your suggestion here is bananas.  I think we found the mom.", "She has 5 siblings, and her parents sleep in this bed, so...", "No, she put it in ignorant and stupid trashy words!", "No, you are trashy and ignorant!  Much better!", "That would seem to be different from hovering. Love the description.", "6 kids in a 2 bedroom house?", "NTA. While my husband and I were dating - and living together - we went to visit his parents. They put me in a whole other house\u2026that they were \u201chouse-sitting\u201d. Sure it was next door but wow! Did I mention it was over Christmas?!? Nothing like curling up in a complete strangers house by yourself on Christmas Eve! The relationship with the parents never did improve.", "ESH\n\nYou and your BF the least of which\n\nIt\u2019s her house, her rules -  regardless of how dumb the rule is.\n\nYou/BF:  Could out an air mattress of the floor somewhere and sleep apart.\n\nMom:  She\u2019s totally unreasonable - you/BF are doing her a favor and she acting like it\u2019s the other way around.  It\u2019s totally ridiculous to expect someone doing you a favor to subject themselves to that long a day, for no apparent reason.\n\nIf an acceptable compromise can\u2019t be reached, decline to watch to kids and tell her to make other arrangements.  That is her problem, not yours.", "YTA their house their rules", "Agreed NTA - Mother is a fool and I hope OP stands her ground.", "Yeah, ya don\u2019t get it both ways.  OP I\u2019d let mom figure it out.   This is insanity", "Best answer.", "Lol. Not the mom. Just a little older and hopefully less narcistic than my youth. Still have my parents alive and have teens myself. Mom sounds maybe a Lil religious maybe has reasons there. Anyhow I'm okay letting my parents be the asshole once in a while and going along with it just because I have respect for what they did/do as parents.", "Sleeping in the same bed is inappropriate? \n\nI don't think you owe someone respect when they're trying to enforce their own values on you, especially when these values are actively preventing the person from receiving a favour from you (that they asked for!).", "You understand OP and her bf are doing the mother a huge FAVOUR, right?\n\nWould you want to wake up at 4am, commute between 1-2 hours each way to babysit 4 kids and then leave to be home by a 10 pm for someone who is very ungrateful for the help she\u2019s getting?", "In a2 bedroom house!", "Lol but not for your boyfriend to imposition himself for a 17 hour day of babysitting and bus rides. Your mom sounds like my ex\u2019s mother. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for you for that. Don\u2019t cave.", "I guess I'm okay with respecting someone else's values even temporarily, and even more so when they are my parents. I know the sticky part here is its a favor.   \n\n\nThe problem is these parents have minors in the home and they are trying to project what they believe to be positive values to the rest of their children. Willing to bet if there were no children in the home, mom wouldn't ask such a thing. Moms do way more than they ever get back...so yeah, I'd say throw her a bone. And the favor is big, and very upsetting to schedules. I would probably leave my significant other at home while I helped out my family and not put them through the travel nightmare. This is a huge favor for her parents (I totally understand with young ones). All the help you give will come back to you anyways with your own kids, weddings, college, whatever. Karma, good parents, whatever you want to call it, the favor is a sucky good thing to probably do.", "I appreciate your reply!  I understand.  I\u2019m not religious, but my mom is.  I get the occasional bending to one\u2019s mom over their beliefs but in this case it\u2019s ridiculous to me. They\u2019re offering to do the mom a really big favor and her request here is dumb as heck.  I don\u2019t like the idea of asking someone for help and demanding how they give it.", "It's almost unreasonable to ask them not to fuck (had they not been sleeping in a public space). \n\nThey're staying in their house, looking after their children for free, and are adults who live together. \n\nI think being asked not to have sex is a concession I would make in this situation, as I understand that is a somewhat reasonable thing to be uncomfortable about, especially if they are using your bedding. \n\nBeing asked not to share a bed is abject disrespect. Not only does it show that the mother still sees her daughter as a child, it also implies that the daughter would agree not to fuck and then go back on her word.", "Mortality Police sound like something out of Logan's Run. \n\n\nNTA -\"Her House, Her Rules\" hope she enjoys ruling over her domain, instead of visit abroad. Heavy is the head and all that rot.", "Damn right she isn't!"]}
