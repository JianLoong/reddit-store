I knew that Vicky would be there, but I hoped that she would be kind enough.\n\nOnce again, we were wrong.\n\nAt first, it was fun.\n\nVicky came over to (surprisingly) apologise to Alina for speaking about her body like that.

She told Alina that Alina \u201cowed\u201d her, because she helped Alina get over her \u201cnasty accent,\u201d &introduced her to her husband(me). \n\nAlina &I found this so discomforting.

More insults? NTA", "Heard her out - after basically telling you your wife was 'ugly' and without value?\n\nWhy? So she could double or triple down and insult, hurt, and ridicule Alina some more?\n\nShe is spiteful, mean, and selfish (not sure about insane) and for sure delusional - your family apparently supports her ideas and methods - why else should they claim you should have 'heard her out'.\n\nI\\`d say you had heard enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you \"hear vicky out\"? Go no contact with that toxic AH.", "NTA. The worst relative goooess toooo ...", "Yes. You are absolutely 100% YTA. Not for what you called your sister, but for allowing her to berrate your wife and child as she did for as long as she did. Calling your kid the ugly duckling of the family? Are you effing kidding me?", "NTA.\n\nWhat does Vickey think of your/her mum?", "NTA\n\nhow many times will it take you to understand there is no coming bsck for your sister and going NC should be forever?\n\nSIster also sounds like she has feelings for your wife, i dunno...", "NTA. WOW your sister is a piece of work. There is nothing wrong with wanting to stay child free but she should not try to force it on everyone else", "NTA, jesus what kind of obsession does your sister have with her? She was upset she couldn't control her body like how she influenced her thinking when coming here? Stay away, very far away. Talk to the family and lay it down and draw a clear boundary.", "NTA\n\nSuper misogynistic, Vicky!!", "NTA.  You should have 'heard Vicky out'?  She was saying that your child is a mistake, that Alina betrayed Vicky for keeping her child.  There is no 'hearing her out' when she is spewing such AH nonsense.  I suggest you put a mile-wide distance between you and your AH sister, and tell your parents that you will never step foot in a room that Vicky occupies.", "and then everyone clapped", "Vicky's in love with your wife.", "Is your sister unable to have children? NTA", "this was exactly my thought. Maybe she built up the life they were going to have, some version of it, and her getting pregnant ruined it.", "Or unable to have children herself\u2026", "Whenever I hear people say stuff like this I wonder how they would react if the same things were said to their mother figures/important people who happen to be mothers in their lives.", "The family isn't much better if they wanted OP to \"hear Vicky out\" - I'd be keeping wife and baby away from the whole family.", "Also how is she ALSO racist? How is there even anymore room for another kind of awful in this? And what does hearing her out involve - more body shaming, misogynistic, racist insults? NTA and carry on living your good life away from her.", "Just on a biological level this is ridiculous... obviously women have worth outside of childbearing but if we're reducing things to just a \"value\" judgement then what is more valuable than having children? How does she think our species functions? Does she resent her own mother for giving her life? Is it just some extreme nihilism/self hate projected onto others who dare to procreate? Idk, but obviously NTA.", "Anyway what is there to \"hear out\" what would the outcome of them staying to hear her out be? She shouts more abuse at them? \n\nI am quite curious what OPs sister and family want them to hear her out on? Convince them to ditch the baby? lmao", ">Also, my family rarely bands together around a single person like this so I must have done something wrong.\n\nPretty sure as far as your family is concerned you married someone with a \u201cnasty accent\u201d....I mean, I hope that's not the case but pretty sure they're putting blood first. Honestly it's time to write the whole family off and protect your daughter from their toxicity. NTA at all. Your sister's child hate is more than a little disturbing.", "Yeah person A is screaming and insulting persons B and C for no reason at a family gathering and the parents\u2019 response is\u2026.let person A keep screaming until she pops a blood vessel? The proper response is to lead person A away from other guests and tell her to leave immediately.", "That they essentially condoned this treatment is what gets me. That entire family needs to be on immediate lessened contact until they get their priorities straight. Wow... And this has been ongoing for that long! And his parents are so busy trying to LeT hEr Be HeArD that to hell with how she treats his wife and child???? I... yah, nope. \\*smh\\*", "Issues???  Issues???  Hell, this woman has whole life-time subscriptions.\n\nNTA, and I wonder if Sister Vicky is gay and in the closet.", "Vicky is either in love with Alina or cannot have children. Either way, she\u2018s also a massive asshole for treating her family this way. NTA", "You know, I think you might be right.  Hadn't considered it until I read your comment, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's true.\n\nOP is NTA", "Check all that apply: misogyny, fat-phobia, mom-phobia, etc. She probably has some deep seated insecurities about growing older and \u201closing\u201d her beauty or gaining weight. She\u2019s fallen head first into the hate society shines on moms and agrees with them.", "Exactly, I get why people don't want kids and that's fair (I don't want them either) but what is the point they are trying to make hating on those who do want kids? They lose that argument before it even starts just from them being born themselves", "OP should just have gone \"Ouch, Vicky, is that what you think of OUR mom too?\" I imagine the tables would have turned real quick.", "My guess is that the sister would like them to apologize for daring to have a child without her permission. Obviously since the world revolves around the sister this is the only answer.", "I was wondering if she\u2019d had an infatuation with the wife years ago and not wanted to acknowledge it.", "This. Vick's belief that since she helped Alina be more social Alina is somehow beholden to her FOR LIFE? Please. \n\nAnd even if Vicky feels how she does and that Alina has \"ruined her life\" by having a baby - why say it out loud? Just keep it to yourself? How hard is that? The family backing up Vicky is disturbing because all she had to do was NOT SAY ANYTHING.", "YES. I had the same thought, complete with a crush on the wife. She seems oddly attached to another woman's body..."]}
