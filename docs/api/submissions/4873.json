Well there\u2019s a 5 year old boy who I\u2019m going to call Blake. Cute kid but he\u2019s aggressive and doesn\u2019t listen. If he doesn\u2019t get his way, he throws tantrums. He also has a bit of a bullying problem. \n\nAll of this has been discussed with dad who doesn\u2019t give a shit but apparently there\u2019s nothing we can do because his dad could close down the place if he wanted to. \n\nAs an adult who works there, I do my best. My coworkers as well. We don\u2019t say anything to Blake and try our best to keep him and the other kids happy and safe. But I\u2019d be lying if I said that we like him. He\u2019s been aggressive towards us too and many of my coworkers have been reduced to tears. \n\nDespite all this, one coworker, Jade, has never complained about him once, offers to take care of all his needs, and defends him 24/7. I can respect that. But I also think it\u2019s unfair for her to call us bad people for not enjoying having to take care of Blake. \n\nWe were cleaning up and all the kids had gone home. One coworker was a little upset because Blake had been particularly nasty to her. \n\nShe then said she hopes he\u2019ll change because she doesn\u2019t see a bright future for him. Some coworkers agreed and said that he\u2019s definitely committing this crime or that crime in the future. I kept my mouth shut.  \n\nJade suddenly went \u201cYou guys sound real pathetic talking shit about a little kid.\u201d\n\nSome coworkers rolled their eyes but one jokingly asked her if she was his mom.  \n\nJade got really mad and said something along the lines of: \u201che\u2019s just a kid and yet all you 20 something year olds are treating him like he\u2019s the next coming of Satan. We need to do better.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to say it so loud but I ended up saying that we\u2018re doing our best but some kids are just not nice to be around. \n\nJade asked me what I meant by that and I just told her that she just needs to realize that she can try all she wants, but some kids are just terrible and she can\u2019t expect everyone to like him. \n\nShe began to cry? And then told all of us that if it weren\u2019t for Blake and the other kids, she\u2019d quit on the spot. She then called me heartless and has been cold to me since. No one thinks I\u2019m in the wrong but my boyfriend and mom do and are agreeing with her (forgot to add->)because of something that happened to Blake which I\u2019m sympathetic of course but I\u2019ve taken care of many kids in similar situations and Idk, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671199512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znffyu/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_stop_expecting_us/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was ridiculous - hitting and screaming and disrupting everything. It was horrible and impacted all of us and the other kids. We found out she was in foster care and had come from a chaotic situation. So we (a bunch of teenagers and one former substitute teacher) created a behavior plan for her that was a combination of correction, redirection, modeling and positive reinforcement. \nAt the end of the summer her social worker came to see us and explained that we had been a place holder while they searched for an institutional option, but that her behavior had improved so much over the summer that she was able to stay with her foster family and would move back into a regular classroom. \n\nYTA. Pull up your socks and support the child you are being paid to care for", "Yta because you didn't put in your post that the boys mom left dad and he kid months before school started.", "Look, Jade is completely right - you shouldn't badmouth 5 year old kids and you SHOULD do better. This 5 year old kid, with proper help, will probably get his shit together and frankly you as a professional childcare specialist have a big responsibility to help him do that.\n\nThat being said, you work in a stressful field and honestly you NEED a safe space to vent on occasion with other people who understand your line of work (aka your coworkers). Jade should understand that. But, I think the important piece is to separate your vent sessions from your work as much as possible so that you can keep things professional. Honestly, if y'all expect Blake to act like a turd, he'll rise up to meet your expectations. It's hard for kids to shake the expectations placed on them, and if you and all your co-workers are using work as your place to vent about his poor behavior than it might actually just compound to make the problem worse.\n\nIt might be better to get a drink with one or two coworkers after work on occasion to vent about work? This way you are at least trying and build some professional separation from the place where you express how you feel about Blake versus the place where you are literally being paid to try to help Blake improve?", "ESH. Are you kidding me? Venting is healthy. Ragging on this kid and keeping it going well after he's gone for the day isn't. It's probably hard for Jade to be nice to him too, but keeping positive helps. Talking shit about him is probably wearing on her last nerve for him. She doesn't have the right to tell you who you can or cannot like, but if you and your co-workers are going to be that petty about a whole child, you're probably in the wrong field.", "ESH. I get it because I used to work as a camp counselor and I have kids of my own. Kids can be nasty, especially if their home situation isn't the best, which sounds like it might be the case for Blake. Your coworker is an asshole because you shouldn't be expected to like everyone. However, you and your coworkers are assholes for talking about what kind of criminal this kid is going to become. Its clear he is misunderstood at home if thats how his father reacts to his behavior, the last thing he needs is to be misunderstood at his care center as well. This creates a bias towards him because no one will want to handle a kid they believe to be a future carjacker. He is ignored at home and he is ignore by his care providers. How is he supposed to act in this scenario?", "NAH I work with a kid a bit like that. He yell, hit, spit, bite, destroy everything around him. When I try to put him in time out, he just laugh in my face and the other 3 kids I work with are affected by this.\nI never had a child like that. I dread it when I know I have to spend my entire day watching him. (7am to 8pm) This kid stress me out so much and I did cry out of frustration more than one time.\nI really don't like him and I am relieved that in 8 month he'll be 3years old and be sent to school and I'll never have to see him again.\nI tried everything... being nice and understanding didn't work, be firm didn't either.\nEven his own mother doesn't know what to do anymore since his big brother was nothing like that at his age.\nBut still. He is a child and I do my best to treat him like everyone else and engage him in different activity.\nMy days are filled with him being punished for one thing or another and it is exhausting.\nHe will need therapy for sure, and I hope for his and his mother sake that one day he will be  better.\nHe is a child so its best not to judge him too quick. But I can understand the need to vent as well.", "ESH\n\nSome kids are just plain unpleasant to be around. \n\nESH bc you all are lacking in professionalism to keep your opinions on children to yourself. Take it to a private, Jade free, environment. And Jade too for popping tears at work. Extremely juvenile all around.", "You're NTA for finding a child difficult to like and manage. But it isn't fair to label a 5 year old, especially if that leads to him being treated differently. You've already indicated that you don't think he's 'normal' and that you find him 'scary.' You might think you're not going to treat him differently, but if you're already thinking of him in these terms you might be unconsciously displaying to him that you think he's different or bad, and children will pick up on those things.\n\nBlake's behaviour is certainly challenging, but he's 5, and apparently has little parental guidance. He may be being abused, which in little boys can manifest this type of outwardly aggressive behaviour. So maybe try and view him through that lens-- Blake might not yet have a way to express his fears and frustrations, except through disruptive behaviour, because he's 5 and hasn't learned how to communicate any emotional distress he may be feeling in healthy ways.\n\nYou don't have to like the child, but your coworkers speculating that he's a future criminal isn't exactly stellar behaviour either. And you have no way of knowing whether Blake is picking up on all your resentments towards and frustrations with him. Maybe you could access some extra child psychology resources to help figure out what's behind Blake's behaviour and how you as the adults looking after him could try different approaches with him, instead of writing him off as a future jailbird.", "YTA. He is a 5 year old child. If he's displaying aggressive behaviours then there's a high possibility it's because he's experiencing these at home. \n\nTreat him with kindness, and maybe he will have a bright future. He is a child!", "I worked childcare for several years. I quit when I was 9mo pregnant and a \u201cBlake\u201d was head butting me as hard as he could in the gut, after months of bad behavior. It\u2019s normal to have nasty thoughts about someone who is making your life miserable. *But we do not speak those thoughts aloud about children.* THAT is an AH move, and therefore ESH except Jade.", "YTA. Not liking a kid is one thing, we're all human, but speculating that a **5-year-old** is going to grow up to be a criminal is fucked-up and, yes, pathetic. Condemning that kid's inner character (\"some kids are just terrible\") is maybe even worse, and frankly it's a bit disturbing that you're working in childcare while deciding that some kids are beyond hope. Jade is in the right and you and your coworkers need to do some serious self-reflection about how you're viewing the young children under your authority.", "ESH (except Jade). She's not wrong that you're all kind of pathetic for talking smack about a defenseless little kid. Because he's just that- a kid. Just because Blake is aggressive now, doesn't mean he always will be, and did you stop to consider that there's some reason he's like this? That maybe there's issues at home and he's just acting out because of that? Jade has the right idea by treating him just the same as the other kids and the rest of you are terrible for singling him out. If you didn't want to deal with kids (and by that I mean ALL kids, not just the \"normal\" ones), you definitely got yourself into the wrong business.", "NTA- but if he's acting like this then there's most likely problems at home and you should see about getting him help. It sounds like his mom might not be around and that could definitely lead to him acting out to get attention", "\"Because of something that happened to Blake\"\n\nThat seems like important information that explains his behavior. You chose to work with children. It's your job to nurture and care for ALL of them. 5 year Olds don't know how to regulate their emotions, yet, and he sounds like a very unhappy child. Rather than help him navigate his emotions, you and his other carers decided to write him off and say he's a future criminal. Shane on all of you. \n\nYTA", "NTA. The stresses of dealing with kids would send me around the bend . Props to you for being able to deal with an absolute terror and still keep going back to work.", "Esh. The adults gossiping about which crime he'd commit in the future were way out of line and deserved the criticism. But you weren't one of them. But you did defend them. And she needs to understand that you're all allowed to dislike whoever you want as long as you still treat them with respect.", "Yta. He's a 5 year old with some sort of truama and you're expecting him to do what exactly? Be a robot? Behave better than most adults? If you can't even regulate your our emotions how tf are you expecting a child to? \n\nI'd love to understand why people think children should behave better than adults. Talking shit about a child really isn't behaving as an adult now is it?", "So I'm a nurse manager for child and adolescent inpatient psych unit and I feel I'm a bit qualified to weigh in on this. YTA. A big gaping one that might pull small planetary bodies into it's gravitational field. You're an ignorant, completely unprofessional,  entitled AH and should probably not take care of anyone's children. I would fire you for your lack of empathy and clear inability to intervene with therapeutic de-escalation techniques. You're a childcare worker and have no contractual guarantees that the job you have will be all cupcakes and ponies.  I would also coach your coworker who is well-intentioned but stepping outside of her lane.", "NTA. Children can be terrible. Entitled adults who bully other people don't spring out of the ground fully grown.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with not liking a rotten kid. But it's up to everyone to treat him with the same kindness as every other child and handle his behavior appropriately. Most kids (mental issues/ traumas aside) will learn what they can get away with, and where. You can retrain his behavior while he's in your presence (and then do it again every Monday because his parents will ruin it over the weekend).", "yta\n\nBlake doesnt seem to have the greatest home life and being only 5, it has a huge impact on his behavior. Jade is right, you re being pathetic. sure, you dont have to adore him but speculating about him becoming a criminal based on his behavior at the age of 5? thats an utter ah move right there.\n\nthe child needs help and not adults who judge him and already think of him as a future criminal.", "NTA. I feel like we\u2019ve all met people we didn\u2019t like. You are not required to like a child that makes you cry or is constantly fighting you.  You are a person and are allowed to feel frustrated. You treat the kid well and keep him safe. That\u2019s what your job requires you to do and that\u2019s what you do. Next time be more mindful who you vent with! Coworkers aren\u2019t your friends.", "YTA. Interesting that you didn't include the fact that Blake's mother had just left him in your main post. I mean, it's pretty obvious that is would cause a 5 year old to act out. Coupled with the fact you and your co-workers are writing him off as a criminal, I'm not surprised he lashes out at you.\n\nThe kid is FIVE and you and your other co-workers are writing him off as a bad egg, saying some kids are just bad. That's actually shocking. Jade is absolutely right and I admire that she can be professional and caring in this situation. \n\nVenting about a child being badly behaved is one thing. But that's not what you're doing - you're making nasty predictions that he'll be a criminal. He's FIVE. Don't write children off like this. You're adults being paid to work there; you are not the victims here.", "NTA because you didn\u2019t say anything to the kid but remember he\u2019s s the product of his environment. Does the care center work with a counselor you can refer him to? He needs help and obviously his father isn\u2019t handling things right.", "More information needed - how old is this child?\n\nI feel both sides are right, usually it's not the child's fault, look at the parents. I am a nursery manager, some children are difficult and we have a moan and a laugh, but at the end if the day they are children and we have to look at what we can do to help them. We are there to teach and guide them, their behaviour is a reflection of their troubles and their level of understanding. Usually \"bad\" behaviour is a cry for help or need for connection and understanding. I'm guessing this child is older than nursery level, I also taught in secondary schools and some of the behaviour was very threatening and scary, but usually that child is having a hard time and the system just isn't able to meet their needs. Children that drove me crazy in lessons were great when I spoke to them one on one. They just couldn't handle the full class lesson.", "YTA and so are all your coworkers, except Jade. He\u2019s 5, you\u2019re adults. Act like it.", "YTA. In fact, all of your coworkers are huge assholes too and if I ever overheatd the staff at ANY childcare facility or school speaking ill of a child like this, I'd file a complaint and I'd push it hard. You've said so far that this CHILD has an inattentive father, has had \"something\" happen to him to cause his behavior and a mother who essentially abandoned him just a few months ago. Oh, and you also stated that almost every employee who cares for him not only hates the kid, but actively talks shit about him together like it's some kind of break room gossip. This is gross and concerning. You and your coworkers are entitled to *feel* however you want, but speaking on it crosses a huge line. This child very clearly needs extra help and support.
