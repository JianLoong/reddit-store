Well there\u2019s a 5 year old boy who I\u2019m going to call Blake. Cute kid but he\u2019s aggressive and doesn\u2019t listen. If he doesn\u2019t get his way, he throws tantrums. He also has a bit of a bullying problem. \n\nAll of this has been discussed with dad who doesn\u2019t give a shit but apparently there\u2019s nothing we can do because his dad could close down the place if he wanted to. \n\nAs an adult who works there, I do my best. My coworkers as well. We don\u2019t say anything to Blake and try our best to keep him and the other kids happy and safe. But I\u2019d be lying if I said that we like him. He\u2019s been aggressive towards us too and many of my coworkers have been reduced to tears. \n\nDespite all this, one coworker, Jade, has never complained about him once, offers to take care of all his needs, and defends him 24/7. I can respect that. But I also think it\u2019s unfair for her to call us bad people for not enjoying having to take care of Blake. \n\nWe were cleaning up and all the kids had gone home. One coworker was a little upset because Blake had been particularly nasty to her. \n\nShe then said she hopes he\u2019ll change because she doesn\u2019t see a bright future for him.

We need to do better.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to say it so loud but I ended up saying that we\u2018re doing our best but some kids are just not nice to be around. \n\nJade asked me what I meant by that and I just told her that she just needs to realize that she can try all she wants, but some kids are just terrible and she can\u2019t expect everyone to like him. \n\nShe began to cry? And then told all of us that if it weren\u2019t for Blake and the other kids, she\u2019d quit on the spot. She then called me heartless and has been cold to me since. No one thinks I\u2019m in the wrong but my boyfriend and mom do and are agreeing with her (forgot to add->)because of something that happened to Blake which I\u2019m sympathetic of course but I\u2019ve taken care of many kids in similar situations and Idk, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671199512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znffyu/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_stop_expecting_us/", "score": 860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was ridiculous - hitting and screaming and disrupting everything. It was horrible and impacted all of us and the other kids. We found out she was in foster care and had come from a chaotic situation. So we (a bunch of teenagers and one former substitute teacher) created a behavior plan for her that was a combination of correction, redirection, modeling and positive reinforcement. \nAt the end of the summer her social worker came to see us and explained that we had been a place holder while they searched for an institutional option, but that her behavior had improved so much over the summer that she was able to stay with her foster family and would move back into a regular classroom. \n\nYTA. Pull up your socks and support the child you are being paid to care for", "Yta because you didn't put in your post that the boys mom left dad and he kid months before school started.", "Look, Jade is completely right - you shouldn't badmouth 5 year old kids and you SHOULD do better. This 5 year old kid, with proper help, will probably get his shit together and frankly you as a professional childcare specialist have a big responsibility to help him do that.\n\nThat being said, you work in a stressful field and honestly you NEED a safe space to vent on occasion with other people who understand your line of work (aka your coworkers). Jade should understand that. But, I think the important piece is to separate your vent sessions from your work as much as possible so that you can keep things professional. Honestly, if y'all expect Blake to act like a turd, he'll rise up to meet your expectations. It's hard for kids to shake the expectations placed on them, and if you and all your co-workers are using work as your place to vent about his poor behavior than it might actually just compound to make the problem worse.\n\nIt might be better to get a drink with one or two coworkers after work on occasion to vent about work? This way you are at least trying and build some professional separation from the place where you express how you feel about Blake versus the place where you are literally being paid to try to help Blake improve?", "ESH. Are you kidding me? Venting is healthy. Ragging on this kid and keeping it going well after he's gone for the day isn't. It's probably hard for Jade to be nice to him too, but keeping positive helps. Talking shit about him is probably wearing on her last nerve for him. She doesn't have the right to tell you who you can or cannot like, but if you and your co-workers are going to be that petty about a whole child, you're probably in the wrong field.", "ESH. I get it because I used to work as a camp counselor and I have kids of my own. Kids can be nasty, especially if their home situation isn't the best, which sounds like it might be the case for Blake. Your coworker is an asshole because you shouldn't be expected to like everyone. However, you and your coworkers are assholes for talking about what kind of criminal this kid is going to become. Its clear he is misunderstood at home if thats how his father reacts to his behavior, the last thing he needs is to be misunderstood at his care center as well. This creates a bias towards him because no one will want to handle a kid they believe to be a future carjacker. He is ignored at home and he is ignore by his care providers. How is he supposed to act in this scenario?", "NAH I work with a kid a bit like that. He yell, hit, spit, bite, destroy everything around him. When I try to put him in time out, he just laugh in my face and the other 3 kids I work with are affected by this.\nI never had a child like that. I dread it when I know I have to spend my entire day watching him. (7am to 8pm) This kid stress me out so much and I did cry out of frustration more than one time.\nI really don't like him and I am relieved that in 8 month he'll be 3years old and be sent to school and I'll never have to see him again.\nI tried everything... being nice and understanding didn't work, be firm didn't either.\nEven his own mother doesn't know what to do anymore since his big brother was nothing like that at his age.\nBut still. He is a child and I do my best to treat him like everyone else and engage him in different activity.\nMy days are filled with him being punished for one thing or another and it is exhausting.\nHe will need therapy for sure, and I hope for his and his mother sake that one day he will be  better.\nHe is a child so its best not to judge him too quick. But I can understand the need to vent as well.", "ESH\n\nSome kids are just plain unpleasant to be around. \n\nESH bc you all are lacking in professionalism to keep your opinions on children to yourself. Take it to a private, Jade free, environment. And Jade too for popping tears at work. Extremely juvenile all around.", "You're NTA for finding a child difficult to like and manage. But it isn't fair to label a 5 year old, especially if that leads to him being treated differently. You've already indicated that you don't think he's 'normal' and that you find him 'scary.' You might think you're not going to treat him differently, but if you're already thinking of him in these terms you might be unconsciously displaying to him that you think he's different or bad, and children will pick up on those things.\n\nBlake's behaviour is certainly challenging, but he's 5, and apparently has little parental guidance. He may be being abused, which in little boys can manifest this type of outwardly aggressive behaviour. So maybe try and view him through that lens-- Blake might not yet have a way to express his fears and frustrations, except through disruptive behaviour, because he's 5 and hasn't learned how to communicate any emotional distress he may be feeling in healthy ways.\n\nYou don't have to like the child, but your coworkers speculating that he's a future criminal isn't exactly stellar behaviour either. And you have no way of knowing whether Blake is picking up on all your resentments towards and frustrations with him. Maybe you could access some extra child psychology resources to help figure out what's behind Blake's behaviour and how you as the adults looking after him could try different approaches with him, instead of writing him off as a future jailbird.", "YTA. He is a 5 year old child. If he's displaying aggressive behaviours then there's a high possibility it's because he's experiencing these at home. \n\nTreat him with kindness, and maybe he will have a bright future. He is a child!", "I worked childcare for several years. I quit when I was 9mo pregnant and a \u201cBlake\u201d was head butting me as hard as he could in the gut, after months of bad behavior.

Not liking a kid is one thing, we're all human, but speculating that a **5-year-old** is going to grow up to be a criminal is fucked-up and, yes, pathetic. Condemning that kid's inner character (\"some kids are just terrible\") is maybe even worse, and frankly it's a bit disturbing that you're working in childcare while deciding that some kids are beyond hope. Jade is in the right and you and your coworkers need to do some serious self-reflection about how you're viewing the young children under your authority.", "ESH (except Jade). She's not wrong that you're all kind of pathetic for talking smack about a defenseless little kid. Because he's just that- a kid. Just because Blake is aggressive now, doesn't mean he always will be, and did you stop to consider that there's some reason he's like this? That maybe there's issues at home and he's just acting out because of that? Jade has the right idea by treating him just the same as the other kids and the rest of you are terrible for singling him out. If you didn't want to deal with kids (and by that I mean ALL kids, not just the \"normal\" ones), you definitely got yourself into the wrong business.", "NTA- but if he's acting like this then there's most likely problems at home and you should see about getting him help. It sounds like his mom might not be around and that could definitely lead to him acting out to get attention", "\"Because of something that happened to Blake\"\n\nThat seems like important information that explains his behavior. You chose to work with children. It's your job to nurture and care for ALL of them. 5 year olds don't know how to regulate their emotions, yet, and he sounds like a very unhappy child. Rather than help him navigate his emotions, you and his other carers decided to write him off and say he's a future criminal. Shame on all of you. \n\nYTA", "NTA.

The adults gossiping about which crime he'd commit in the future were way out of line and deserved the criticism. But you weren't one of them. But you did defend them.

He's a 5 year old with some sort of truama and you're expecting him to do what exactly? Be a robot? Behave better than most adults? If you can't even regulate your our emotions how tf are you expecting a child to? \n\nI'd love to understand why people think children should behave better than adults.

But it's up to everyone to treat him with the same kindness as every other child and handle his behavior appropriately.

Jade is right, you re being pathetic. sure, you dont have to adore him but speculating about him becoming a criminal based on his behavior at the age of 5? thats an utter ah move right there.\n\nthe child needs help and not adults who judge him and already think of him as a future criminal.", "NTA. I feel like we\u2019ve all met people we didn\u2019t like. You are not required to like a child that makes you cry or is constantly fighting you.  You are a person and are allowed to feel frustrated.

Coworkers aren\u2019t your friends.", "YTA. Interesting that you didn't include the fact that Blake's mother had just left him in your main post. I mean, it's pretty obvious that is would cause a 5 year old to act out. Coupled with the fact you and your co-workers clearly dislike him, I'm not surprised he lashes out at you.\n\nThe kid is FIVE and you and your other co-workers are writing him off as a criminal, saying some kids are just bad. That's actually shocking. Jade is absolutely right and I admire that she can be professional and caring in this situation. \n\nVenting about a child being badly behaved is one thing.

I am a nursery manager, some children are difficult and we have a moan and a laugh, but at the end if the day they are children and we have to look at what we can do to help them. We are there to teach and guide them, their behaviour is a reflection of their troubles and their level of understanding. Usually \"bad\" behaviour is a cry for help or need for connection and understanding. I'm guessing this child is older than nursery level, I also taught in secondary schools and some of the behaviour was very threatening and scary, but usually that child is having a hard time and the system just isn't able to meet their needs. Children that drove me crazy in lessons were great when I spoke to them one on one. They just couldn't handle the full class lesson.", "YTA and so are all your coworkers, except Jade.

In fact, all of your coworkers are huge assholes too and if I ever overheatd the staff at ANY childcare facility or school speaking ill of a child like this, I'd file a complaint and I'd push it hard. You've said so far that this CHILD has an inattentive father, has had \"something\" happen to him to cause his behavior and a mother who essentially abandoned him just a few months ago. Oh, and you also stated that almost every employee who cares for him not only hates the kid, but actively talks shit about him together like it's some kind of break room gossip. This is gross and concerning. You and your coworkers are entitled to *feel* however you want, but speaking on it crosses a huge line. This child very clearly needs extra help and support.

Obviously it's easier to have that reaction when it's so obviously a vibe thing and not the child being \"objectively bad\" (I guess I'm more like Jade - there was one kid who was quite badly behaved and he was one of my favorites. I liked the challenge I guess). (ETA: also should say I'm not endorsing my past self in terms of not liking those kids. I have no idea what my efforts to \"not let it affect how I treated them\" amounted to, and if I were to go back with what I know now I'm curious whether I'd find a better way of managing those feelings. It would be nice if so, we'll see if I ever get back into childcare).\n\n\nThe problem is that these aren't coworkers you have to deal with, they're children who are growing and developing and learning the world and you are an important participant in that.

You are also authority figures who are much more powerful than he is, even if it doesn't always feel that way because you can't wield your full power against him (and good thing you can't, in a no-holds-barred fight one of you would die and it wouldn't ever be you). And labelling a child like that as hopeless, as a guaranteed future criminal, as a bad seed, has its own impact on the child and their development. It's not a neutral act, or an act against a peer who can be expected to handle it.\n\n\nI'm not saying you can't think those things; to some extent you probably can't help it, and maybe you believe they are factually true and therefore fair to think, and if you think them it's unavoidable it will bleed into how you treat the child. I can say it has a negative impact on the child but it is what it is, nobody's perfect at their jobs. But you can still make things worse or make things better, and I'd say talking about him between coworkers in terms that validate between all of you that he's inherently bad and a lost cause is a way of making things worse.\n\n\nTo some extent there's a question of \"how much did you mean it\" - you can say \"we were just venting of course we don't *really* think he's 100% sure to do those crimes and even if we say that it doesn't mean we aren't mindful to treat him in a fair and kind way\" and \"are you saying we can't vent about how hard our jobs are at all\" but the problem is, nobody can read each other's minds. In that kind of conversation between 6 people, 3 could be thinking it's all in good fun, 2 could be relieved to have kindred spirits about how bad the kid is and 1 could feel comforted in their belief he should be treated a certain way accordingly. And in this conversation we *know* that at least one person interpreted the tone of the conversation as \"treating him like he's the next coming of Satan\". (and from both the sentence you report and the context of your post we can assume this comes from the aggregate of all of your experiences together with this kid, not just this conversation).\n\n\ntl;dr: You don't have to like every kid. But you have to treat them all in a way that gives them the best chance to develop in a well-adjusted way, and talking between yourselves as caregivers of a certain kid about how terrible the kid objectively is increases the chance that the kid won't be treated this way, by you or by others in the conversation.", "YTA\n\nUsually when kids act like jerks, especially at the preschool age, someone else in the kid's life is abusing or neglecting the child. \n\nI get being frustrated and I think you and your coworkers were venting and I know you are probably not trained or paid enough to deal with \"problem\" children, but the Blake is an innocent.

Which means they have their own personalities, coping mechanisms, etc. \nOf course he's been through something horrible, no kid acts like this just because. However you can still not like how he treats you. You can still not like him as a person. \n\nBut you cannot let it affect the care you give. That's the boundary. You don't have to like him, but you still need to treat him with love and respect because that's your job. Working with kids means you're going to be a stable adult who shows up and demonstrates care. And after your shift you can leave and cry in your car. \n\nHere's where I can understand your coworker. I don't think it's appropriate to make subjective comments about children or coworkers in the work place. I think this is a line that should be held for your mental health as an employee, and for the betterment of the kid. For example: Jack hit me today and it hurt, has anyone else experienced this? Is there a pattern when he hurts people physically? This prompts conversation, prompts an opportunity to learn, share experiences, and doesn't make the kid the villain.\n A example with a coworker: I notice that Margaret has been praising Jack after he knocked someone's tower down, can we all check in to make sure we're holding the same behavioral expectations? \n\nI know this is a lot of info, but remember you're NTA! And, there's still room to grow as a teacher always, and you don't have to like every kid or coworker, and you can't let it affect your job performance.", "NTA because you need a safe space to be able to vent & Jade should understand that.

The exception would be if his behavior forces different treatment for the sake of the other kids, then that does sometimes need to happen. Kids are people, and thry all have different personalities, and not everyone will be able to handle every kid. Part of going into every childcare field is learning how to handle and accept the personalities  that are not compatible with yourself. Sometimes, that comes in the form of venting.\n\nI would add a caveat that it seems management and this kids father has contributed to the issues with Blake- you are actually unable to treat him the same because of potential repercussions on the daycare. That seems to be an unsolvable issue and contributing to the aspects of Blake's personality you guys cannot handle. It is also negatively impacting students and staff. You aren't wrong in thinking it will likely continue. This will make him difficult  to deal with, and Jade should not be trying to micromanage the staff venting their frustrations on this particular student. It seems to be the only real coping mechanism you have left because you cannot address the root issue. She's not wrong in saying the workplace has an issue, but I don't think she understands the issue well either. And it's her choice not to depersonalize work, but she does need to understand there is a level of emotional exhaustion for most people with child related jobs\n\nI'd say NAH because the situation sucks and you guys are just coming from different perspectives that are completely subjective.", "ESH.

I actually think this whole story is more about how you talk about a 5yr old than you telling a coworker to stop expecting you to like a 'problem' child. This child is nothing but a product of their upbringing right now. You say you kept your mouth shut when other workers spoke ill of the child and their future but in my mind the fact that you immediate went to the defense of the other coworkers when one coworker defended the CHILD speaks a lot more about you than it does her.\n\nTo me it seems you only have one person working around you that sees these kids as kids and not just little bundles of joy you get to take care of. Some people truly believe kids can do no wrong, but that isn't how I read your coworkers demeanor.

My son waited for the jerk to come out of class, and then knocked his ass out.

You can care about a child you work with, or even love them in a way, but don't have to like them. I nannied a high needs child for three years and she was definitely worse at home than at school, but the poor behavior was a result of her parents not teaching her correctly or addressing the behavior properly. It doesn't matter what they're diagnosed with or not, it was their failure to parent. She was extremely smart and could be genuinely loving and kind when things were going her way but extremely violent or manipulative if she didn't agree with something. My only hope is that kids like her and Blake are treated with extreme patience as they are raised to be better people and control their actions towards others.

With that being said, kids with behavioral issues need extra attention, redirection, and compassion.

My need for her approval actually caused me to look like even more of a shit in front of her because my attention seeking behaviour as a kid is what pissed her off, which I didn\u2019t understand at the time. So I would express my frustration to my friends and other teachers and they\u2019d say \u201cno! No, she likes you, she\u2019s just hard on you because she wants you to succeed!\u201d But I knew that she didn\u2019t like me.

They know how you feel about them. I guarantee everyone's opinion of him is fully transparent to that child. He might not be able to explain it, but he knows you treat him differently. You should quit. You're not cut out to be a care taker. \n\nAnd frankly, it doesn't matter if you've had other kids in \"worse\" situations. First of all, you don't really know that. It sounds like you don't know much about his home life at all, so you have no idea what he's really dealing with. For example, did those kids have parents who weren't ignoring the issues like Blake's father? That would make a difference to how they were handling their issues. \n\nALL KIDS ARE DIFFERENT. You can't expect one to handle things the same way as another.", "Reserve all your sentimentality, the child is a rebel and that is why anyone who thinks that is a serial killer or a criminal, mature life is not black or white, an emotional creature who likes to project himself", "Thank you for your service to public education! This former Blake really appreciates you!", ">I wonder what the subtle attitude of \u201cthis one sucks\u201d does?\n\nWell you're in luck! Look up The Monster Study from 1939 (University of Iowa)", "There have been studies about troublemaker kids (usually kids of color) and how their behavior may be identical to \u201cgood\u201d kids, but because of their label they receive harsher punishments.", "OMG exactly! I was a Blake and I knew which teachers/support workers hated me and which were trying to help me. I promise Blake knows, and it will only make his behaviour worse because he is acting out due to pain and trauma and knowing the adults around you low-key hate you is more pain and trauma!", "Maybe you're right, but it's incredibly frustrating to try to work with a kid who's behavioral issues aren't being dealt with at home. It doesn't matter how much you try to reach the kid, or how nice you are, or understanding. If he is allowed to behave poorly at home, it's not going to change outside of the home.", "Yeah easy to say.\nWhy don't you give a crap about the OTHER kids.\nThe majority.\nWhy does this little prince matter more than them?", "But he is being rewarded for bad behavior. He is stealing time and resources from the other kids. \nHe IS getting special treatment.\nSure don't rag on the kid so he can hear but why reward his bad behavior?", "That's a very great argument to get a salary raise, but unfortunately, unless you're a doctor, if you work with kids, you don't get a good salary. And even if we say that daycare workers are well paid, they still didn't go to school to learn how to be a therapist for children, especially of that age. \n\nAnd if everyone knew how to handle this kind of children, therapists wouldn't exist.\n\nYes her coworkers shouldn't say that this kid will be a criminal, but she's definitely not an ahole for not knowing how to take care of his trauma. That's just not her job. Her job is to make sure they are safe, fed, socialising, and stimulated. You can't blame her for not knowing how to handle his trauma when it's not her job.", "[removed]", ">Find another job that doesn't require empathy and compassion.\n\nThis. 100%. She should quit yesterday.", "> Kids aren\u2019t dumb. Just because you guys don\u2019t say it to his face, doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t noticed that you aren\u2019t as warm to him.\n\nDo you think he's also noticed the correlation with his own behavior?", "This right here.", "It's a fair comment?", "And that's exactly how kids end up being criminals. When all the adults in life fail them.", "\u2764\ufe0fhonestly, learning it all and the experience I had teaching was such a cathartic re-parenting for me. And teaching SEL helped me integrate those lessons into my own life really holistically and my interpersonal relationships have never been better. \n\nI wish I could have stayed in education indefinitely, but it was just not enough money for the HCOL city. Best working experience of my life so far, though.", "\"Socialising and stimulated\" - so you agree it is part of her job to help the child.", "Oh, I'm aware of how low educators and Para educators get paid. But, it is in the job description. If everyone who worked with kids did the bare minimum, society would crumble. More than it is. Compassion and empathy for others costs nothing. It's a shame that more people don't realize that.", "They chose the job.", "She knew the pay when she took the job. Caring for all the children is the job. I agree that teachers and Para educators make little money, but that is a separate conversation. Thank you for your mature and measured response.", "Likely not because he\u2019s literally 5 and the cognition involved in consequence comprehension isn\u2019t fully developed until 13 or so (why we have laws structured around young offenders, they are not able to understand the potential consequences of their actions). On top of that, regression is one of the most common responses to trauma (I.e kids might start wetting the bed again, go back to sucking their thumb, act out like they did as a younger child, etc). 5 year olds are only starting to learn social tools and behaviour regulation. A kid that age who has been abandoned by a parent is experiencing a huge amount of confusion, anger, and despair with no ability to cope, ask for help, or mitigate those emotions.", "He is 5, expecting that of him is developmentally inappropriate.", "No, because, he\u2019s five. He doesn\u2019t have to. That is not a developmentally appropriate expectation for him. An adult woman on the other hand? \n\nAn adult woman working with children absolutely should be able to do that, and if not, you find a new job. You don\u2019t shit talk little kids. There will always be children like Blake. If you hate those kids that much, the solution is to work elsewhere.", "What he's noticed is that his behavior gets him attention, something he is craving.", "That doesn't mean she is a therapist either way. You need at least a master degree to offer proper help for trauma. I know a lot of people don't believe in therapy, but I would certainly not trust a daycare worker to help a child with his trauma. It's just gonna fuck the kid up. It's literally what's happening there too. The kid doesn't need more Jade, he needs someone who knows how to help him. None of my teachers, none of the daycare workers knew how to help me with my trauma, so yeah, I wouldn't expect neither OP nor Jade to know how, and they don't either. Even social workers weren't helpful for me. Only well trained therapists gave me the help I needed.", "Doesn't mean they choose to deal with issues that SHOULD be dealt with at home or outside of daycare.", "[removed]", "You don't need an advanced degree to understand this child needs compassion. He was abandoned by his mother, and his father is now a single parent. The kid is acting out because he is angry, doesn't know how to process those emotions, BECAUSE HES 5, and attention for bad behavior is still attention. I'm not saying she provide therapy,  just not shit talk a child behind his back. Do you need an advanced degree to know that makes her the AH?", "People who scapegoat kids will always find a kid to scapegoat.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Sorry if compassion for a 5 year old is too \"emotional\" for you.", "I mean... she didn't say that the kid would never be a nice person growing up. She only said that some kids just aren't nice to be around with. Her coworkers are assholes for saying that the kid will become a criminal, but she didn't say that. She only said that despite all efforts, there are kids that people just don't like. It doesn't mean she'll never show compassion nor empathy to him. I dislike some people but still show some empathy, compassion, and try to be nice to them. Doesn't mean I'm not allowed to dislike them.", "And people who excuse poor behavior will always find a reason to excuse it, but that doesn't help the kid in the long run. And there is only so much you can do outside of the home.", "I don\u2019t recall him receiving less care than any other child. Idgaf what they say when he\u2019s not around as long as he\u2019s taken care of when he is. There is compassion and then there is being soft. You fall under the latter."]}
