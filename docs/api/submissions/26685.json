They said something about there being issues with a dentition Kay got and I need to come down to the school. I got to Kay\u2019s school to find Kay, her principal, and vice principal all in the Principal\u2019s office. \n\nLast Monday Kay got a detention for being late to class As her school works they give you a week to serve your detention and if you don't you get ISS (in-school suspension ). They went to get my daughter for ISS and my daughter refused to get up telling them if they made her go to ISS that's double jeopardy since she already severed detention and that she should be allowed to use her rights to the 5th amendment\u2026 pretty bold for an 8th grader to say. I asked them if they could check to see if she served it since I do remember having to pick Kay up late so she could go to detention. \n\nWell turns out Kay did serve that detention After looking through video cameras the teacher that day just accidently didn't mark her off. After being there for a while it was almost afternoon I decided to just say I was going to pick Kay up for a dentist appointment anyway and Just get her out of school early. Kay and I just went out to lunch and then home. \n\nMy wife worked an 8-hour shift yesterday so she got off at 2 Kay gets done with school at 3 so she was surprised to see Kay at home. I explained what happened and how I just decided to bring her home early while I was there. The wife got mad at Kay making her go to her room for being disrespectful and a smart ass. She then got mad and yelled at me calling me a AH  for rewarding Kay for acting like a smart ass. I'll admit Kay was a smart ass but she was using stuff she learned in school against them\u2026 usually, she's a good kid and gets great grades so I seriously don't see a problem with it but my wife still won't talk to me AITA?", "created_utc": 1694485010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gex5h/aita_for_rewarding_my_daughters_smart_ass_behavior/", "score": 1054, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She did the punishment she was supposed to do, school made a clerical error and she simply called them on it.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe stood up for herself by using the information she learned at school. Was it slightly smart-assed? Yes, but most 8th graders tend to be smart-assed at least half the time. At least it was that way back in the dark ages when I was in school. Taking your kid home early was no big deal, it doesn't look like it's an all-the-time thing.  \n\n\nPerhaps the teacher should have detention for not marking a student as doing a detention. Kidding. Teachers can make mistakes.", "NTA - I only see \"smart\", no \"ass\".

You need to talk to your wife about what she expected, why she is upset, and what she would have wanted to have happen. I wonder if there is something more at work in her mind than is immediately apparent.", "NTA. In fact I'd be proud of my daughter if she stood up for herself like that instead of just accepting unjust punishment, even if it was a bit of a smartass way to go about it, it was effective. Your wife though, punishing your daughter for not being an obedient servant who willingly accepts being punished unjustly, just had a bad mom moment and owes your daughter an apology. One she's unlikely to be willing to give because she sounds stubborn.\n\nAs for taking her home for the day, it was probably for the best, and not necessarily a reward. The staff would likely be peeved about the situation for the rest of the day, and it's just better to let everyone at school sleep it off, then back to business as usual the next day.", "NTA! lol Kay is definitely going places. She stuck to her guns and stood up to the school when she knew they were in the wrong. Your girl has a bright future(:", "NTA. \n\nAs a high school teacher, I fail to see the issue here.

Many young women struggle with having a against adults that are in the wrong.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe is going to school to be educated.  She just got a great education on why its important to speak up when you're being treated unfairly.

NTA.", "You let your kid know you have her back and to me that's awesome parenting!", "NTA, but your wife sure is.\n\nThere is NOTHING more awful and depressing and damaging then \\*knowing\\* that you are 1000% right about something when you are a child, and then all of the adults around you going \"NO!  We are the ADULTS and WE know that WE are right and YOU are the one that is WRONG because WE are the GROWN UPS\" and they just don't listen.\n\nIt's horrible how adults behave this way towards children, and refuse to listen to kids and actual investigate, and leads to horrible outcomes far worse than having extra detention - we're talking abuse and bullying.\n\nKudos to you for believing your child and allowing her to stand up for herself, and for teaching her that it was the right thing to do.", "YTA for letting your wife punish your daughter for being 100% right. Stand up for your kid, even if its against her mom or some crackpot teacher who can't keep attendance straight. If you're right, you're right. Being a teen doesn't mean you have to be a doormat.  She did absolutely nothing wrong. Are you trying to raise an independent adult or some mindless sheep who let's people walk all over them? Pur your pants on and stop letting her get bullied when she's not the one screwing up. Your wife is completely out of line.", "NTA why is your wife mad?

This isn\u2019t even being a smartass, this is your daughter standing up for herself against wrongdoing. Your wife is way out of line on this one.", "NTA. There is a big difference between being a smart ass and standing up for yourself. This was obviously the latter. You rewarded her for standing up for herself, and there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nIn fact, I would say it's a good thing because it reinforces in her brain that what she did was right.", "NTA. Mom needs to calm down and stop being so controlling.", "NTA. Your kid is smart, she knew she was in the right and defended herself. I would've pulled her out too.", "NTA\u2014 and your daughter is far from a smart ass. all she did was call the school out for their bs, as she should. kay definitely is going places. she sounds like an aspiring lawyer.", "Nta Does your wife never want your daughter to stand up for her self? Your daughter proved that she was in the right. Good on you for having her back.", "NTA - there is no other situation in which anyone would agree to go through double the punishment.

She\u2019s likely worried that as a teenager, her being able to \u201cbest\u201d her teachers in this situation could cause her to want to try to do it all the time, turning her into someone who is disrespectful of authority. I agree that she stuck up for herself and she was right to do so in this case, but there is further conversation that you could have here about being sure she is respectful when she disagrees with someone and making sure to pick appropriate battles and not just to disagree for the sake of being difficult. She sounds like a smart girl, now you just need to make sure she knows how to be mature about those brains :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She had the right to assert that she had already served her detention. What is wrong with advocating for yourself? \n\nI did something similar in 9th grade when a teacher claimed he wanted to search my backpack for candy. There were other kids around me that had candy gift bags from a sports thing. I was not part of that sport and I have no idea why he decided to pick on me. I was a debate kid so I told him under New Jersey v TLO (a Supreme Court case) he needed reasonable suspicion to search my backpack and he didn\u2019t have it. The teacher made a joke about it and moved on. \n\nI would have a further talk with your wife about why she is upset. There is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself but there are always discussions that can be had on the best ways to do so. For example, it is better to be calm and explain why you disagree with someone rather than curse at them. I know that your daughter didn\u2019t curse anyone but I can\u2019t think of a better example. Good luck to your daughter. Sounds like she could be a very good lawyer one day.", "NTA, good for you to stand up for your daughter.

It usually isn\u2019t their fault.  Half the time parents can wake up late or get side tracked with a work call. The car might of malfunctioned or their was a traffic accident. Kids who are under driving age rarely can be faulted for being late if they are ready when they are meant to be. \n\nWhen I was your daughter\u2019s age I had a teacher super angry about how kids who take the bus don\u2019t get marked off as tardy when they are late. She claimed it didn\u2019t matter why the bus was late it was still late. I then told her how that scenario happened to me the year prior. I woke up on time and went to my bus stop 15 minutes before it arrives. Which was 90 minutes before school even started. Private school that started at 8 ended at 2. I was there at 6:30 and at 7:30 my bus driver rolls by me and the other kid who used the bus saying they woke up late. He was driving his car so we had to wait for him to go get the bus. How is that our fault we were on time and our parents left to go to work already. We had no other alternative to get to school. Mind you this is in Suburban America where public transport is sparse and doesn\u2019t go to our school. It was too far to walk to without being late or getting lost.  After I gave her a valid reason that kids who rely on the bus have no control over how they get to school they shouldn\u2019t be held responsible compared to someone who lives down the street and can walk there.", "NTA.   \n\n\nSchool messed up.  She called them on it. Then you listened to her (as a parent should do) and showed the school they messed up. Did anyone there apologize to her?  You did the right thing.", "NTA. You didn't \"reward\" anything -- you did what was right. Your daughter already served her punishment and communicated that she shouldn't be punished twice. She was absolutely correct to use what she'd learned in school. \n\nIt's probably time to have a discussion with your wife because there may be something deeper going on. It's not great that how she reacts to disagreements is not talking to you.", "NTA. I don't understand why your wife is mad?Why should your daughter get double punished because someone else made a mistake?", "NTA\n\nYour daughter called them out for their marking error, while being polite about it. She wasn't disrespectful or witty about it, she politely objected. There's a mile wide difference there.\n\nYour wife is TA for second guessing your parental decisions. She should not punish your daughter over something she wasn't present for whilst you were.", "Nta. Was your daughter a bit of a smart-ass. Yes...but she was still RESPECTFUL in her manner. You did the right thing to stand behind your daughter in support of her standing up for herself against injustice. Her takeaway is dads got her back, she doesn't have to be a silent victim to a system in error and the things she's learning in school can be applied to life! even if she kind of mixed the legal definition up a bit she still applied it in a logical and rational manner. Good for her. And good for you daddy. Also I'd be encouraging her to try for debate team if the school has one!", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't being a smart ass, she was resisting being falsely accused of not serving her detention.\n\nI think your wife is only concerned about feeling embarrassed because others might think less of -her- because you and her child rocked the boat rather than just meekly submitting to the accusation.\n\nYour daughter had a unique way of expressing it, but all that matters is she was resisting a false accusation of not serving detention.  You backed her up when she needed help proving she wasn't lying by making the school double check, which is completely fair.\n\nYou need to sit your wife down and talk about why she's actually angry.  Why does she think her daughter should have submitted to something that wasn't fair?  Is it only because she feels embarrassed?  If that's the case, she needs to reexamine her priorities.  What is she teaching her child with her behavior?  That it's wrong to stand up for herself?  That image in the eyes of strangers is more important than the truth?  That she should accept injustice against herself for the sake of keeping the peace?  That her mom won't have her back when she's falsely accused and so she can't trust her when she needs help?", "NTA she did the crime, she did the time. She should stand up for herself. I always taught my daughter to stand up for herself because my parents never stood up for me. For anything, especially in their church.

She caused a disruption in class. She could have talked to the principal privately and asked to have you present with her during that meeting.

But disrupting other kids while they are learning is a no no. There are exceptions of course but in this instance it was made into a bigger deal than it needed to be.\n\nBTW, I dont think she was being a smart ass.

Yes, you should talk to her abt being respectful but she wouldnt have gotten anywhere other than detention by being polite at school. They would not have listened, just sent her on her way.

I asked when it had happened, as I got to school early every day to get good parking (parking lot didn't fit all the cars they gave passes to) and never parked in the teacher's section. They said \"Huh, that's weird, I don't have a record of the date, or even the ticket. Will you be paying cash or check?\" Took another 5 minutes of explaining that if I never received the ticket and they have no record of the ticket, just a balance in the computer not associated with anything, that I wasn't going to pay for any ticket and they had to give me the year book I had already paid for.

She definitely needs to have reinforcement that polite refusal is almost always better than being sarcastic or rude, but standing up for yourself isn't something we should want to quash either here.", "The reason my daughter got a dentition was pretty messed up in the first place\u2026. Basically, my daughter had started her period and her school doesn't allow them to carry backpacks where she had pads so she had to run to her locker and then back to the bathroom which caused her to only be a few minutes late but even after explaining to her teacher they still didn't excuse it so she got detention \n\nSo the initial incident wasn't really even her fault or at least something she can't help", "True, but whether one's job makes them \"cranky\" or not, it doesn't make it okay to potentially take it out on their kid ... Especially when their kid was only trying to stand up for themselves in an unfair situation.", "I understand that,  I know I couldn't do what my wife does. Her job can be very stressful at times", "I don't think there are very many 12 or 13 year olds that would simply acquiesce to being punished for some dumb adult's mistake. When you were in 8th grade you would just let yourself be punished again because somebody forgot to write down that you were already punished?", "This is hilarious lol", "When does your wife want her to learn to stand up for herself, smart ass or not. In 8th grade when she has parents to back up her or teach her right from wrong. Or when the authority she's been taught blindly obey tries to take advantage in a more dangerous way! \n\nWomen/girls can't afford to be nice, or subtle. When a wrong is wrong it's okay to yell first, and apologize later. Adults are not by default correct, and deserving of respect, and children are not automatically wrong, and subservient!", "I think it's about time you start saving for law school. The girl is going places.", "You have a good kid. All the structure of school is not for everyone. She seems smarter than most adults. Once she\u2019s out in the real world, she\u2019s going to crush everyone. Keep encouraging her to think outside the box and never to just accept a wrong doing because an \u201cauthority\u201d figure says so. That\u2019s never okay.", "Double jeopardy isn't about serving a sentence twice, it's about being tried twice.", "Well, obviously. She should have said that it violated her right to due process under the 14th amendment, not double jeopardy under the 5th. Don't they teach these kids anything?", "And the daughter too as she did nothing wrong in standing up for herself. NTA op", "Yes.  Welcome to the idiocy of public schooling in the US, where the rules are the rules because the administration can't be trusted to think and apply logical thought processes to the scenarios that play out with children sometimes.  It'd be so sad if it wasn't actually necessary once in a while, at the least (it's the same as the tags that say 'don't iron while wearing' and the like - you... you sort of do, but sort of don't, want to know why someone felt the need to write that down, you know?).", "Wait, your wife knows this?", "Doesn't matter - adults are expected to act like adults, and children will act like children.  It's understandable that an adult with a difficult day / week / month / etc. can sometimes get short-tempered, but that's a REASON, and not an EXCUSE (something the wife and I regularly remind my children when we see it happening).  I suspect, given your response, that this is something you are already teaching your children, but it bears repeating that your wife, assuming your daughter wasn't rude here, now has a teachable moment where she can admit she was wrong, why, and your daughter gets reinforcement today on the fact that no one is infallible, apologies can absolutely solve some problems, and another example of what \"being the bigger person\" looks like.", "I think its an ongoing thing or the wife wouldn\u2019t be so upset. Cos like you said that school detention situation was dumb, but I don\u2019t sit around acting like there isn\u2019t signs of neglect in the family. I think we could use one less entitled smart ass in the world. Should be an asshole for coming to the internet instead of getting his household under control.", "But you can raise a double jeopardy challenge if you were about to serve a second sentence based on \"finality.\"", "The 14th amendment is equal protection and irrelevant in this situation. The 5th amendment includes double jeopardy, which would apply here since they were attempting to punish her twice. Due process is the 6th amendment and is not applicable since she was not denied due process since the meeting with the principal et al. would serve as due process in a school setting.", "You didn't say he was an asshole, you told him to \"man up\" to get his kid to, uh, be nicer to authority.", "Also, the prize values are doubled and there are two more Daily Doubles on the board to find.", "1) There is a [due process clause](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/amendment-xiv/clauses/701) in the 14th amendment and it applies against the states, which includes bodies politic created by the state, such as a school district. In this case, the in-school suspension is arbitrary and capricious because she has already served the detention upon which it is based.\n\n2) Double jeopardy is a criminal right, not civil. \n\n3) The [5th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause), not the 6th, also contains a due process clause, but it only applies against the federal government.\n\nSource: IAAL", "he needs to man up and stop worrying about what the internet thinks on a very narrow minded situation. Like all he\u2019s getting is a bunch of quirky assholes acting like its no big deal when they could just be real with him and hit the problem in the roots. Why solve one problem when you could solve everything", "[deleted]", "Pfffft. Friggin casuals. WHAT IS double jeopardy", ">And?\n\nI'm doing my part by trying to help you.", "Who respects authority for authority's sake?", "All you did was point out what i said. Thats dumb cos i want to know what you think not what i think. Thats why i said And?", "Like hes literally saying his wife still wont talk to him but yeah lets all just call her an asshole and not act like he should go do something to fix it", "I said your opinion was bad, then I made that little joke about you (getting better) being the improvement in the world. Complaining about some kid being rude, LMAO", ">Yeah its sooooooo quirky letting your children have 0 guidance.\n\n>getting his household under control.\n\nRethink these statements.", "If his marriage fails or his kid grows up to be a smart ass I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter. I think its pretty goofy to have people call your wife an asshole on reddit cos she wanted her kid to learn something. Its not my place to raise the kid im just saying why the fuck would anybody like a smart ass? Are you 13 too cos maybe you don\u2019t have the experience to really see how dumb this post was", "Youre cringe", "I could spell because when I was 13.", "~~Heres your apostrophes ''~~\n\nOh, I missed some so the joke doesn't land.
