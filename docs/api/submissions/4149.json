So I didn\u2019t have a say in it. But i was okay. \n\nShe comes early Sunday morning and tells me a long list of food intolerances. I have a busy schedule and meal prep weekly. So, i bought all the groceries she needed but asked her to cook her own meals as i may not be able to prepare as per her specifications. \n\nApart from this she had a lot of special requests and complains. She constantly complains about how cold it is even though its not under my control. Our thermostat is controlled by apartment building. She made me close up all the windows and still complains cool wind is coming from somewhere. I feel suffocated as i need atleast a little airflow i usually keep the kitchen window a little open. And she wants all the lights off at night which is not how i keep,  i have a couple bed lights in the hallway and keep the kitchen light on at night. Its a little irritating that i have to make so many changes to accommodate her and she doesn\u2019t adjust on anything.\n\nAfter the interview, she came home and informed us that she maybe need to stay a few more days or upto 2 weeks. I told my husband it doesn\u2019t work for me. I had a busy couple of months and am looking forward to the holidays to relax. My husband told her we have other plans and she needs to look for other accommodations. My husbands been a little angry for me making him do that. She seems to be offended.

You've been polite thus far. You don't owe her a 2 week stay.", "NTA- \n\nShe asked to stay for an interview. She had the interview... \n\nShe has intensive needs as a guest that literally are in opposition to your needs as a person who lives there or are things you can't even control (the temperature in your own apartment). \n\nYou already did what was asked. It's okay not to do more... And your husband can be annoyed but honestly, he's not the one fielding her complaints.", "NTA, she made a change of plans you couldn\u2019t accommodate. But it\u2019s bizarre you had to buy her groceries.", "NTA. She is not entitled to stay in your home, and frankly she sounds exhausting and high maintenance. Your husband should not have invited her to stay without discussing it with you.", "NTA - it's your house. Your place of peace. If you don't feel peaceful at home due to a guest, or course you can tell them to leave", "NTA  \n\nYour place is not her hotel.   She can't tell you how to run your home or how to set the lights. \n\nShe is the guest and not the owner.    \n\nYou gave her a bed and a bathroom and your kitchen.  AND you bought her food for goodness sakes!    \n\nShe is a chore to have around and your husband is wrong for getting upset about this.   \n\nShe got the few days she originally asked for and you are not required to extend her stay.     \n\nPay for a hotel, lady!", "NTA - you\u2019ve already done much more than a lot of people would have. If they\u2019re that self-centered and needs to be catered to, perhaps a hotel is a good fit for her.", "NTA \n\nThat woman comes from the interview and just tells her hosts that she may need to stay for a few more days or even 2 weeks!\n\nAnd this was after constantly complaining that her accommodation was not upto her standards. Well, she can find an AirBnB and stay as she wants", "Thank you all for the positive comments. I am still getting used to the married life and was worried that my husband would think less of me. This helped a lot!", "Nta! Oh my goodness this chick is rude. \n\nThat is a lot of request for a self invited guest and that is a long stay to spring on you. Not to mention right around the holidays. \n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with you not wanting a un expected guest.", "Holy cow NTA!\n\nLet\u2019s be real, it\u2019s more than rude to not consult you first, and personally, it would make me incredibly uncomfortable that this friend is also a woman. Add to that her completely out of line demands which she decided to then up the ante by simply announcing she might have to continue mooching there for UP TO TWO MORE WEEKS.\n\nHer behavior is more than a little weird, incredibly thoughtless, and regardless of how salty he is, you had every right to kick her to the curb. His one redeeming quality in this situation was at least he was intelligent enough to go along with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have every right to feel the way that you do.  It\u2019s ok to stand your ground when A. Someone is making you feel uncomfortable in your own house B. You are unhappy with how someone is treating you. \n  Your husband made this decision without consulting you. You were more than kind to humor the two of them until after her interview. Compromise is one thing but bending over backwards to someone that is disrespectful is stupid. You did the right thing. I\u2019m glad your husband told her no, even if he was unhappy about it.", "NTA. House guests should not come with demands, nor should they be changing the way you live. I\u2019m still shocked that she gave you a list of HER food needs and that you actually bought the food instead of telling her where she could find the nearest grocery stores.", "NTA and I question your husband's taste in friends.  This one is an entitled person and he seems fine with that, but he's not the one having to accommodate her, you are.  Don't let your spouse get away with this.  Let him be mad he had to tell her to leave and stew in it.  He created this situation with bad boundaries.", "NTA.  Two weeks is too long for even some family members. This chick needs to make other arrangements", "NTA. And this is weird. When I\u2019ve been recruited for out of town interviews, the interviewing company has generally paid my expenses.", "NTA \"informing\" your host that your 3 day visit may need to be more than two weeks is completely out of line. It sounds like your husband is uncomfortable being in the middle.", "NTA, beggars can't be choosers. However, it shouldn't have been your husband's responsibility if it's your problem.", "NTA- Whenever I have ever stayed at Friends homes I have tried to make as little hardship for them as I possibly can. I completely clean up after myself. I have never asked for any \u201cspecial\u201d accommodations to be made for me. I\u2019ve also bought new toilet paper rolls and put them in the cabinet to replace what I use. I\u2019ve bought groceries for all of us and help cook and clean up. I try to make my short stay as pleasant as possible. I would NEVER expect them to cater to me as they were doing me a favor by allowing me to stay with them for the short time I was there. \n\nIf I were sleeping on the couch, I made sure I was up before they got up and had everything folded. I used the bathroom before they were scheduled to be up and made it quick so I didn\u2019t use all the hot water. I completely cleaned the bathroom so they weren\u2019t walking into a mess.\n\nI would absolutely NEVER treat my friends the way she treated you. My food restrictions are my own issue to deal with and unless someone has a food allergy it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to accommodate!!! \n\nI am so sorry you had to deal with that!! You and your husband need to sit down and discuss this. While it is admirable to want to help out a friend, bringing anyone in to live with you is something you BOTH need to discuss before allowing- and Boundaries need to be respected.\n\nYou were more than accommodating! You went overboard with buying her groceries and trying to make her feel at ease in your home. I cannot imagine treating my friends the way she was treating you and demanding you to change your home to accommodate her many wants. If you are cold you put a sweater on - you don\u2019t demand they turn up the heat! \n\nIf she asks again to stay with you please have your husband tell her no. People like her use others to pay their way thru life - and it is damaging to your marriage to have her stay with you. Your husband will be torn by trying to cater to his friend and she will try to make it seem like you are against her. \n\nIf she gets the job was she planning on living with you while she \u201clooks for a place to live\u201d? \n\nUgh! No. Just say no. Discuss this with your husband NOW so that he is ready to say NO when she asks again. And she will ask again because she\u2019s looking for someone to pay her way so she can live for free and have all her Wants taken care of. \n\nYour marriage will not be able to survive this. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. You must have the patience of a saint! I would have asked her to leave after she started complaining. I\u2019m glad your husband asked her to leave. Let him be upset.", "NTA \n\nBut you\u2019re husband sure is one though.\nThis isn\u2019t already starting out as a good marriage if he\u2019s treating you like a doormat by not discussing what you\u2019d both think or want from a situation like this first. \nThen he gets mad that you finally say you have enough of what she\u2019s doing and tell her to leave when she was already an unwanted guest your husband dragged into the house\n\nMakes me wonder if there\u2019s some other reasons as to why the husband wanted you to keep her in the house\u2026. Affair?", "NTA, she's not offended, she's annoyed that her free accommodation has reached its expiry date.", "NTA. She's had what you agreed to.", "NTA. She wasn't angling to stay just for the interview; she wanted cheap permanent accomodation. If you don't nip it in the bud, 2 weeks turns to 2 months, turns to 2 years.\n\nGet her out.", "NTA. You need to talk to your husband about your guest policy. It was his friend that he sprung on you yet you were the one doing all the heavy lifting to make her feel welcome? And fielding all her complaints? He needs to play host to his guests not just dump them on you. And talk to you before agreeing to host.\n\nI'm glad you said No to her extending her stay. If she was so miserable, why on earth would she want to extend the torture for all involved?", "NTA.\n\nShe is the one who has offended you and overstayed her welcome.\n\nYour husband put you in a position by not discussing her stay with you at all.\n\nShe put you in a position with her extreme requests as if you are there to serve her.", "NTA. Honestly I gotta go with your husband is kind of AH. When I got married, my wife moved into the place I bought, but it's now our place. Which means if I'm having people over, I have to get the ok from my wife, even if it's my brother crashing the night. The fact that he didn't ask you and just made the decision unilaterally is super AH move.", "You have already be t over backwards for this woman. NTA. And you need to have a serious talk with your husband about inviting people without consulting you.", "NTA.", "NTA. You have more patience than I, after a few of her complaints I would have kicked her out for her demands and for being so ungrateful. You are not running a hotel. Now she can stay in one, at considerable expense.", "Nta \n\nShe is his guest he should be doing the shopping or she should be doing her own shopping. She can get a hotel. You arent one nor a maid service or a cook.", "Just proof Op was a gracious and accomidating hostess for sure. And I agree, why would you be MAD someones life is not accomidating to your last minute schedule? How can that be offensive??", "Your husbands friend is extremely entitled asking for so much and especially right before the holidays. If your husband has a problem with telling her no, he\u2019s the one who needs to grow a spine, not you.", "This ain\u2019t it.  Think less of your husband for not running it by you in the first place.", "Entirely possible he is projecting the perceived anger/irritation because he did a dumb and didn\u2019t think to ask you first. Would maybe go easy on him depending on how newly married and/or if you were cohabiting long beforehand or not, but might be worth a chat about what you each do or don't need consulting on just to ensure there's no future mistakes. You'll learn together and that's much easier done when ye both feel safe to say what you need.", "Any future guests need to be agreed upon by the two of you.  And it was his responsibility to shut her down when her bad behavior started up.  Also, you are not a hotel or restaurant, so any special food needs she had she needed to handle herself.  Rude behavior from \"guests\" is unacceptable - it should not be tolerated.", "If he does, then he can go with her!! You are wrong. In any shape or form", "Especially since it\u2019s right before Christmas. There\u2019s usually a lot to do, at least for people who celebrate.", "He didn\u2019t even talk with his wife before agreeing to let this woman stay in their house. She was more than patient and understanding. She has every right to make her husband handle the situation since he was the one who put his wife in this position. She always has a right to say no in her own home. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Houseguests need to learn to live with their hosts without complaint of get a frigging hotel/Airbnb. How hard is this concept? You don\u2019t go to peoples houses and start dictating how they live.", "NTA. What is it with people living on the generosity of others making demands? There's no way I would've bought groceries for her. Either your husband or his friend can do it. Cold? Put something warmer on. Don't like the lights? Buy a sleeping mask.", "Agree 100%\n\nWho comes in blazing with demand after demand when they are a guest? If it were me, would be extra careful to not disrupt the owners routine. \n\nNo wonder she's interviewing for another job, and doesn't seem to have folks to hang out with during the holidays. It's really sad actually."]}
