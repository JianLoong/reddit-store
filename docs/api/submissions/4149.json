You have every right to feel the way that you do.  It\u2019s ok to stand your ground when A. Someone is making you feel uncomfortable in your own house B. You are unhappy with how someone is treating you. \n  Your husband made this decision without consulting you. You were more than kind to humor the two of them until after her interview. Compromise is one thing but bending over backwards to someone that is disrespectful is stupid. You did the right thing. I\u2019m glad your husband told her no, even if he was unhappy about it.", "NTA. House guests should not come with demands, nor should they be changing the way you live. I\u2019m still shocked that she gave you a list of HER food needs and that you actually bought the food instead of telling her where she could find the nearest grocery stores.", "NTA and I question your husband's taste in friends.  This one is an entitled person and he seems fine with that, but he's not the one having to accommodate her, you are.  Don't let your spouse get away with this.  Let him be mad he had to tell her to leave and stew in it.  He created this situation with bad boundaries.", "NTA.  Two weeks is too long for even some family members. This chick needs to make other arrangements", "NTA. And this is weird. When I\u2019ve been recruited for out of town interviews, the interviewing company has generally paid my expenses.", "NTA \"informing\" your host that your 3 day visit may need to be more than two weeks is completely out of line. It sounds like your husband is uncomfortable being in the middle.", "NTA, beggars can't be choosers. However, it shouldn't have been your husband's responsibility if it's your problem.", "NTA- Whenever I have ever stayed at Friends homes I have tried to make as little hardship for them as I possibly can. I completely clean up after myself. I have never asked for any \u201cspecial\u201d accommodations to be made for me. I\u2019ve also bought new toilet paper rolls and put them in the cabinet to replace what I use. I\u2019ve bought groceries for all of us and help cook and clean up. I try to make my short stay as pleasant as possible. I would NEVER expect them to cater to me as they were doing me a favor by allowing me to stay with them for the short time I was there. \n\nIf I were sleeping on the couch, I made sure I was up before they got up and had everything folded. I used the bathroom before they were scheduled to be up and made it quick so I didn\u2019t use all the hot water. I completely cleaned the bathroom so they weren\u2019t walking into a mess.\n\nI would absolutely NEVER treat my friends the way she treated you. My food restrictions are my own issue to deal with and unless someone has a food allergy it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to accommodate!!! \n\nI am so sorry you had to deal with that!! You and your husband need to sit down and discuss this. While it is admirable to want to help out a friend, bringing anyone in to live with you is something you BOTH need to discuss before allowing- and Boundaries need to be respected.\n\nYou were more than accommodating! You went overboard with buying her groceries and trying to make her feel at ease in your home. I cannot imagine treating my friends the way she was treating you and demanding you to change your home to accommodate her many wants. If you are cold you put a sweater on - you don\u2019t demand they turn up the heat! \n\nIf she asks again to stay with you please have your husband tell her no. People like her use others to pay their way thru life - and it is damaging to your marriage to have her stay with you. Your husband will be torn by trying to cater to his friend and she will try to make it seem like you are against her. \n\nIf she gets the job was she planning on living with you while she \u201clooks for a place to live\u201d? \n\nUgh! No. Just say no. Discuss this with your husband NOW so that he is ready to say NO when she asks again. And she will ask again because she\u2019s looking for someone to pay her way so she can live for free and have all her Wants taken care of. \n\nYour marriage will not be able to survive this. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. You must have the patience of a saint! I would have asked her to leave after she started complaining. I\u2019m glad your husband asked her to leave. Let him be upset.", "NTA \n\nBut you\u2019re husband sure is one though.\nThis isn\u2019t already starting out as a good marriage if he\u2019s treating you like a doormat by not discussing what you\u2019d both think or want from a situation like this first. \nThen he gets mad that you finally say you have enough of what she\u2019s doing and tell her to leave when she was already an unwanted guest your husband dragged into the house\n\nMakes me wonder if there\u2019s some other reasons as to why the husband wanted you to keep her in the house\u2026. Affair?", "NTA, she's not offended, she's annoyed that her free accommodation has reached its expiry date.", "NTA. She's had what you agreed to.", "NTA. She wasn't angling to stay just for the interview; she wanted cheap permanent accomodation. If you don't nip it in the bud, 2 weeks turns to 2 months, turns to 2 years.\n\nGet her out.", "NTA. You need to talk to your husband about your guest policy. It was his friend that he sprung on you yet you were the one doing all the heavy lifting to make her feel welcome? And fielding all her complaints? He needs to play host to his guests not just dump them on you. And talk to you before agreeing to host.\n\nI'm glad you said No to her extending her stay. If she was so miserable, why on earth would she want to extend the torture for all involved?", "NTA.\n\nShe is the one who has offended you and overstayed her welcome.\n\nYour husband put you in a position by not discussing her stay with you at all.\n\nShe put you in a position with her extreme requests as if you are there to serve her.", "NTA. Honestly I gotta go with your husband is kind of AH. When I got married, my wife moved into the place I bought, but it's now our place. Which means if I'm having people over, I have to get the ok from my wife, even if it's my brother crashing the night. The fact that he didn't ask you and just made the decision unilaterally is super AH move.", "You have already be t over backwards for this woman. NTA. And you need to have a serious talk with your husband about inviting people without consulting you.", "NTA.", "NTA. You have more patience than I, after a few of her complaints I would have kicked her out for her demands and for being so ungrateful. You are not running a hotel. Now she can stay in one, at considerable expense.", "Nta \n\nShe is his guest he should be doing the shopping or she should be doing her own shopping. She can get a hotel. You arent one nor a maid service or a cook.", "Just proof Op was a gracious and accomidating hostess for sure. And I agree, why would you be MAD someones life is not accomidating to your last minute schedule? How can that be offensive??", "Your husbands friend is extremely entitled asking for so much and especially right before the holidays. If your husband has a problem with telling her no, he\u2019s the one who needs to grow a spine, not you.", "This ain\u2019t it.  Think less of your husband for not running it by you in the first place.", "Entirely possible he is projecting the perceived anger/irritation because he did a dumb and didn\u2019t think to ask you first. Would maybe go easy on him depending on how newly married and/or if you were cohabiting long beforehand or not, but might be worth a chat about what you each do or don't need consulting on just to ensure there's no future mistakes. You'll learn together and that's much easier done when ye both feel safe to say what you need.", "Any future guests need to be agreed upon by the two of you.  And it was his responsibility to shut her down when her bad behavior started up.  Also, you are not a hotel or restaurant, so any special food needs she had she needed to handle herself.  Rude behavior from \"guests\" is unacceptable - it should not be tolerated.", "If he does, then he can go with her!! You are wrong.

There\u2019s usually a lot to do, at least for people who celebrate.", "He didn\u2019t even talk with his wife before agreeing to let this woman stay in their house.

You don\u2019t go to peoples houses and start dictating how they live.", "NTA. What is it with people living on the generosity of others making demands? There's no way I would've bought groceries for her. Either your husband or his friend can do it. Cold? Put something warmer on. Don't like the lights? Buy a sleeping mask.", "Agree 100%\n\nWho comes in blazing with demand after demand when they are a guest? If it were me, would be extra careful to not disrupt the owners routine. \n\nNo wonder she's interviewing for another job, and doesn't seem to have folks to hang out with during the holidays. It's really sad actually.", "NTA your guest is a tad entitled don't ya think?", "NTA\n\nHusband made the sole decision to invite her to your shared home. You get to make the sole choice when she goes.", "NTA - Your husband will get over it\u2026just like you got over it when he told her she could stay without asking you. Also - you should tell him that the next time he does something like that, he will be responsible for hosting his guests by himself.", "NTA - she sounds horrible, just horrible. This is YOUR house, take it back! Do your routines and keep things how you want them unless she\u2019s paying rent. This isn\u2019t a hotel.

She should have purchased her own groceries along with extras for you hosting her. Your husband's behavior is a bit concerning.", "Your husband should have asked you if it was ok for her to stay in the first place. \n\nIt's not his place to be mad after she's been such a nuisance and made your life harder.", "He already thinks less of you if he is having guests stay over for unspecified amounts of time without your ok. Then allowing said guest to bully you around, and extend her stay without asking. Good for you for putting your foot down. If he thinks less of you for having, and enforcing, boundaries then this marriage has a lot of work needing done already.", "Oh I read the original post incorrectly. Thank you for clarifying!", "Your home is your castle. Defend it. \n\nNTA\n\nYou understood and were tolerant of the guest for as long as possible. It seems as though it's possible this person doesn't have a home to go back to by the way they are acting. Also, wanna keep an eye on your husband, too, just in case.", "NTA.

Sounds like she out stayed her welcome BEFORE she had the interview!", "nta \n\nIt's worth considering couples counseling since it seems like you two have very different viewpoints.

One of my kids has a long list of \"cannot eat\" foods and I always bring my own food for her.\n\nNever-mind that it can be time consuming and difficult to track which foods are actually safe. If shes only asking for meat/fruit/veg that can be okay but with grain based stuff a lot has additives snuck in and buying thr wrong brand or even wrong variety of a brand can be unsafe.\n\n I spend way too much time reading ingredient labels. \n\nNot reasonable to expect a hostess to do.", "Yeah that confused me.

Fish and houseguests go bad after three days, she can't expect to stay for weeks. \n\nBut -- with the risk of sounding like a whacko greeny -- please turn off your kitchen lights at night!
