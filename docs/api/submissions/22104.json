When my daughter was going to be born, my mother in law, who lives out of town was going to come see us and bring my bf's daughter to stay with us.  I thought that was pretty imposing and vehemently objected.  My bf was well aware of my feelings about having another person to care for immediately after having my baby.  I texted with my mil about it as well and suggested that it would be better if they waited until after the baby was born to visit(only because I knew his daughter would be staying with us from the time they arrived).  So my due date arrived and passed and I was scheduled to be induced, they decided to come the day after I was induced.  Visiting at the hospital was fine because it was very short and I was too tired to care, having been in labour for about 18 hours.  But beyond that I wasn't physically or mentally prepared to deal with a very dependent teenager who has been doted on and is completely incapable of even the simplest tasks.\n\nWe get home the day after the birth and are bombarded with family members who decide to show up because other were going to be coming to my home, and they leave my bf's daughter at our house for the following week and half.  This kid doesn't clean up after herself, won't tell anyone about messes she's made and was not helpful in any way with the baby.  I guess it should also be mentioned that I had a natural birth with third degree tears, as well as an episiotomy, so I could barely walk.\n\nAfter that time of having to cook, clean, learn to care for a newborn and do the majority of my usual household tasks, the mil visits again and the subject of new mothers not wanting company for the first while after giving birth comes up, and I say how I didn't want anyone at the house for at least a week she asks me why I didn't speak up, and at that point I felt too defeated to confront her about how she forced me into the situation I was put in, I simply replied that I told my partner.  She and I have had minimal interactions because she lives out of town, so I sort of just sulked.  \n\nSo now I've been avoiding her during her visits and don't want to host my partner's daughter for the last month of summer break.

I put that in quotes because partner implies sharing of responsibilities, and he is somehow totally absent in all this. HE should be taking care of his daughter, and you, and the new baby, and he is clearly...not, like, at all. You need to talk to him and mil; you need to stand up for yourself and your child. All this avoidance only makes things worse.", "Where was your partner while all of this was happening? Why wasn't he parenting **his** daughter? Why were you doing the majority of the household tasks and looking after the baby? Does he work away or something?", "You're NTA, but your partner is. It's HIS daughter. If he hasn't done the work to teach her how to be a decent person, that's on him. If he can't make plans that give you the time you need to recover, that's on him. Where was he when you were cooking and cleaning? HE should have been the one cooking and cleaning, HE should have been the one getting his daughter and his mother to chip in. You should have been the one waited upon, fetched water and food for etc. Hospitals don't send you home completely recovered (unless there's no other choice), they send you home when you're recovered enough that non medical people can do everything that needs doing so that you can finish recovery in the comfort of your home.\n\nYou need to talk to your partner and find out whether he's going to change whatever your current arrangement is. It doesn't sound like his daughter has been living with you and him. Is he thinking that she should now live with you more? What is he willing to do to make that work? Is he going to pick up after her? Or does he think that if you're parenting his second child, that you may as well parent both?\n\nI know it's typical to blame parents in law for these sorts of situations, but you told him, not your MIL about what you wanted (which is very reasonable of you), and given what else you've said, how confident are you that he actually told his mother and tried to make alternate arrangements?\n\nNow is a difficult time to be finding out that your partner is less reliable than you were counting on. But that's what you're seeing. You should tell him to shape up.", "You can\u2019t host someone who lives there,\nShe\u2019s your bfs child and just as important as your baby.

It is logical that a child lives with their parent, and in this case with you as well. \n\nHe could\u2019ve turned it around by asking his mother nicely to watch his child for a week. But I\u2019m put off by the fact that you write like his mother is responsible for the kid and not your partner \n\nESH", "ESH\n\nYou married a parent. His child came with him as part of the package. I get you were tired, but his daughter should be welcome in his home whenever she wants to be there. You can't ban her even if it's inconvenient for you. That's verging into evil stepmother vibes.\n\nYou're also perfectly capable of telling your MIL the truth at all points. You can't just keep quiet and then sulk. You're a mother now; keeping quiet to keep the peace is a thing of the past.\n\nBut, your MIL and husband are the biggest AHs here. His daughter is his responsibility always, and it doesn't sound like he did anything to support you or parent either of his children. Why have you had a child with a man like that? Is this what you want your future to be? Being a single parent whilst married?\n\nAnd your MIL has no right to invade your space without an invitation then play innocent about it. That was manipulative of her, and you need to lay down very firm boundaries that she doesn't get to do that again.", "NTA.  You *did* speak up. \n\nFrom now on you know that you just need to be very blunt about such things.  \u201cNO, we cannot accommodate your plans to visit that week, we already have xyz planned.  <Date> is the earliest that you could come.\u201d", "NTA but don't expect his daughter to help with the baby, that's not her responsibility", "NTA but your TA for having a child by this man. what made you think he would be a good father to your child if his first child doesn\u2019t even live with him, and apparently has no manners", "NTA, but your partner is. Where is he? He is responsible for the care of his daughter, partner, and baby. Shame on him for failing you when you need him the most.", "Yta, she is part of your immediate family.

Deal with his doormat issues first.", "NTA, In my country, thanks to public healthcare, mothers stay in the hospitals for at least 1-2 weeks, precisely to avoid being pressured into  going back to household responsabilities while they can't even walk. Everything is taken care of and the other kids usually visit for a bit every day. \n\nPeople diminish post partum recovery while it's actually very dangerous to try and go about your day with a wound the size of a fist and your organs moving around. The fact that your family did not care that you were going through it says alot about them, specially your MIL.", "NTA, you have a massive boyfriend problem since he appears to be completely spineless and happy to leave you to deal with this nonsense.

I get not wanting visitors, but lots of mothers come home after giving birth and immediately cook, clean, care for a newborn as well as care for their other children.  If you have a second child, are you then going to banish the first child from the house as you wanted to banish your partner's daughter?  Are you not planning on being a family?  And what do you mean, you don't want to 'host' your parents daughter?  That's his daughter!  How petty.", "NTA if you have family, take yourself and the baby there for the month that his daughter is staying for and leave her to him", "YTA. This is your boyfriend's kid. You shouldn't have babies with a man and then demand his child doesn't get to stay with her dad or see the new baby.

I was too tired from my extended pregnancy to be assertive enough to stand my ground (it was overdue by 8 days by the time my baby was born). Now I'm scared to address the issue and cause a rift in the family because I might be too aggressive about it.", "His daughter lives with her mother about a 6 hour drive away, where my bf's mother also lives, his mother took it upon herself to bring the daughter up for the explicit purpose of staying with her newborn sister, which she had expressed wanting to help with, so in this case his mother should have been responsible for her seeing as she decided to bring her away from her home, without so much as asking if that was alright given the circumstances.", "She had said she wanted to come help with her newborn sister, but I didn't expect her to, since she is a teenager, but instead was entirely dependent on adults, which at her age was sort of unreasonable.  She is 14, and is capable of making her own breakfast and cleaning up after herself.", "But this isn't exactly her expectation. This was what the MIL claimed. When visiting AND staying with a mother and a newborn, it isn't an insane expectation that the mother and newborn are the focus. Pitching in even to clean up after yourself is very much important. \n\nOp wanted no company. Then she got many including MIL and a 14year old that wouldn't even clean up after herself or make her own breakfast. All on top of an absent partner.", "The thing is, it's actually my house that everyone is coming to, that I've had before he and I got together and I wasn't about to leave my own home for their convenience.  All I wanted was to have a week or two alone (aside from drop in visits from family that would obviously be fairly short) at home with my new baby and her father.  He also didn't actually have that much time off work, so mostly it would just be me and the baby, without any additional responsibilities.", ">Now I'm scared to address the issue\n\nBetter get over that--fast. You now have a child to look after and if you can't stand up for yourself, who's going to stand up for her?", "Your issue isn't that you need your partner to stand up to his mother. Your issue is that you just had a baby with a man that already has one child he completely failed.\n\nWhy is she living with his parents? How can you call her indulged when her father is such a absent parent? His daughter should be taken care of by him.", "I dont agree. Your husband should \nhave said no, or let them come and parent his daughter. It is his daughter in the end.", "MIL is completely right. Future me- my son is having a second child and I have the first physically six hours away. Of course I'm planning to bring the first child to be with my son, to be a family unit together, and to experience their sibling being in this world. If I don't then the family unit will develop WITHOUT the oldest child. The oldest child IS a part of your family. Not grandma's nuclear family. Wanting a week to settle...without the oldest child.....is wrong. That child IS your family.\n\nYTA/ESH ..\n\nBut really just you and your husband. If you wanted a quiet week advocate for yourself. Your husband's first child, your step child, IS NOT part of that quiet week.", "In your step daughter\u2019s defense: It sounds like this isn\u2019t her home. She is a guest. Therefore her young mind means she doesn\u2019t need to clean up after herself bc she doesn\u2019t live there. I mean at 14 I wouldn\u2019t think I need to do chores when I visit family. I would also guess it hurts that dad is having another baby and she doesn\u2019t live with either parent.  I would be shocked if she doesn\u2019t have some big emotions about it but unsure how to express them even at 14. You\u2019re NTA for not wanting guests but I would be very careful in the future about not letting SD stay bc you will be blamed for their relationship problems.", "Can you imagine in a man had said this?  That he didn't want his step children around because it's his house?"]}
