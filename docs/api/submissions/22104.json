When my daughter was going to be born, my mother in law, who lives out of town was going to come see us and bring my bf's daughter to stay with us.  I thought that was pretty imposing and vehemently objected.  My bf was well aware of my feelings about having another person to care for immediately after having my baby.  I texted with my mil about it as well and suggested that it would be better if they waited until after the baby was born to visit(only because I knew his daughter would be staying with us from the time they arrived).  So my due date arrived and passed and I was scheduled to be induced, they decided to come the day after I was induced.  Visiting at the hospital was fine because it was very short and I was too tired to care, having been in labour for about 18 hours.  But beyond that I wasn't physically or mentally prepared to deal with a very dependent teenager who has been doted on and is completely incapable of even the simplest tasks.\n\nWe get home the day after the birth and are bombarded with family members who decide to show up because other were going to be coming to my home, and they leave my bf's daughter at our house for the following week and half.  This kid doesn't clean up after herself, won't tell anyone about messes she's made and was not helpful in any way with the baby.  I guess it should also be mentioned that I had a natural birth with third degree tears, as well as an episiotomy, so I could barely walk.\n\nAfter that time of having to cook, clean, learn to care for a newborn and do the majority of my usual household tasks, the mil visits again and the subject of new mothers not wanting company for the first while after giving birth comes up, and I say how I didn't want anyone at the house for at least a week she asks me why I didn't speak up, and at that point I felt too defeated to confront her about how she forced me into the situation I was put in, I simply replied that I told my partner.  She and I have had minimal interactions because she lives out of town, so I sort of just sulked.  \n\nSo now I've been avoiding her during her visits and don't want to host my partner's daughter for the last month of summer break.

Where was he when you were cooking and cleaning? HE should have been the one cooking and cleaning, HE should have been the one getting his daughter and his mother to chip in. You should have been the one waited upon, fetched water and food for etc. Hospitals don't send you home completely recovered (unless there's no other choice), they send you home when you're recovered enough that non medical people can do everything that needs doing so that you can finish recovery in the comfort of your home.\n\nYou need to talk to your partner and find out whether he's going to change whatever your current arrangement is. It doesn't sound like his daughter has been living with you and him. Is he thinking that she should now live with you more? What is he willing to do to make that work? Is he going to pick up after her? Or does he think that if you're parenting his second child, that you may as well parent both?\n\nI know it's typical to blame parents in law for these sorts of situations, but you told him, not your MIL about what you wanted (which is very reasonable of you), and given what else you've said, how confident are you that he actually told his mother and tried to make alternate arrangements?\n\nNow is a difficult time to be finding out that your partner is less reliable than you were counting on.
