We split utility bills while she also pays 300e for rent. Its a 2 bedroom, living room, kitchen and 1.5 bathrooms in a nice area, 300e is not nearly how much rent for that place would cost under normal circumstance. Nevertheless, our parents are civil with eachother so the massive discount was agreed upon on the premise that we split utility.\n\n\nI don't pay rent as my parents own it, but work and spend my own money for daily needs and groceries. D doesn't either, her parents pay everything. For a year now, D has been inviting her college friend who I'll call A to study at our place, sometimes sleep over. A lives off campus but in a really dodgy area with her older brother and his friend. More than a month ago, D asked if A can stay over for a week, I told her no problem because I had a vacation set for that time. When I got back 9 days later, she was still at our place, so I asked D when A was going home, as I had planned for my friend to come over for the weekend. She told me A got into a fight with her brother and didn't want to be there rn. I was annoyed but I never found an issue with A so I just asked she leave until the end of the week. She didn't. 3 weeks passed and bills came in, which were almost double of what they were previously. I sat down D, gave her a run-down of the bills and she seemed surprised. She said me \"I'm not paying that much\". I looked at her and made a joke \"Yeah you're not, your dad is\". D got angry and went into her room. I thought the joke didn't land well so I knocked on her door to apologize, but I overheard D ranting how I don't even pay for anything so I wouldn't understand why her parents are mad.\n\nI entered the room, told A to pick up her stuff and leave. She seemed embarrassed, but 20 minutes later she left. I asked D what she meant by that, and she said \"The bills are twice as much as last months and dad is going insane over why he has to pay this much when you even had a guest over.\" I told her shes a hypocrite if she thinks my friend staying over for a weekend affected the bills nearly as much as A living here for a month. She told me I'm heartless for blaming A ,who was having a hard time, for the increased bills, and screamed I should contribute MORE to them. Then, she called her dad in the bathroom and demanded that I pay rent too because it's unfair. I told her she's insane if she thinks I'll pay rent in my own apartment and that she has until the start of the semester to find another place and move out, D started crying and throwing some towels on the ground. She did move out a few days ago. We haven't spoken since, but A texted me apologizing for burdening me.\n\nMy parents told me it wasn't my decision to make, even though they agree. Now, I'm not sure if i was an asshole for making her to move out or for how I acted towards both her and A.", "created_utc": 1692889734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1604kip/aita_for_kicking_out_my_22f_friend_21f_for/", "score": 2880, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So - either D needed to pay the extra, or A should have been asked to pay the extra for that month, however they wanted to handle it.\n\nAs for \"fair\" - D does realize that your parents paying for your \"share\" of the rent & bills is no different than her parents paying her share of the rent and bills, right?  Your parents still have to pay the taxes and upkeep on the apartment just for it sitting there, whether there's a mortgage owed or not, and whether people are living in it or not.\n\nNow for the future, you know that you are not authorized to allow a third person to stay in the apartment for more than a few days, and you are not authorized to kick out another tenant.

I paid \u201chalf\u201d of the market rate, which was definitely affordable at that time (it was $595 total in 2003, so my rent amount was $297.50). I honestly have no memory of if my roommate paid her mother or not, so either she did or it didn\u2019t occur to me that she would & I didn\u2019t have a problem with it. I mean, I was living off a $500/month budget provided to me by my parents, so why pay your mother rent if she\u2019s giving you money for living expenses? I had a larger budget than my roommate did, so she was pretty on top of keeping our utility bills as low as possible while still being comfortable so they never spiked like that.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t put the entire amount of the increase on D. I would also make sure that your utilities didn\u2019t increase naturally. I don\u2019t know how long her parents have owned this basement, but utilities can increase sharply from month to month and if it\u2019s the first year you\u2019re living there the utilities are based off the previous tenants usage for things like heat. \n\nFor example, one of my roommates my first year of college was from a warmer climate. I\u2019d like to keep the house at 80+ all winter long and we were paying for that, even after she moved out for one year because it takes that long for it to reset. That being said, it\u2019s pretty normal for utility prices to increase sharply as soon as the weather gets cold/hot i\u2019ve had them be almost nothing because the fall was comfortable so we didn\u2019t run any heat or AC and had a bill of $15 and the next month have the bill be $80 because that\u2019s how quickly temperatures can drop. \n\nFor kicking her out yourself I do think YTA. Your parents are 100% right and you should not have done that because you got mad at her. And it\u2019s flexing a Power dynamic in a living situation which is really crappy. You should absolutely go to your parents with the situation and they could even talk to her parents about the extra money since her parents seem to be upset. I also would\u2019ve gone to them with a higher utilities, and explained that situation before trying to charge her the entire extra amount. Kicking her out randomly also puts both families in a bad situation and you should\u2019ve considered that for your family. And it\u2019s probably why your parents are annoyed at you. Because now they have to pay for the entire bill of the apartment and if I were your parents, I would make you pay her half of rent until we found a replacement. And tenant replacement, especially when you care about it being a good person because they\u2019re living with your child is not actually a cakewalk. Plus it would put a strain on both families because now she has to live somewhere else and her parents have to help her find that and that\u2019s not gonna be good for your parents and her parents friendships. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re a landlord, but you\u2019re not taking on the responsibilities and consequences of land-lording. Plus, depending on what kind of written contract existed. There\u2019s always a potential that they could sue. (which you definitely want to keep in mind with future roommates because those people might not be your parents close friends and so they might choose that option.)\n\nI do think that you were reasonable to explain that the bill was probably was increased by another person living there almost the entire month not just the weekend. I do think D was unreasonable to claim that you pay nothing when she also pays nothing. But you were eavesdropping and she was venting. And people say extreme things and I understand what made you mad because you were coming to patch things up. It is definitely unreasonable for her to think you\u2019re going to pay rent in an apartment your parents own, but you probably need to get the new perspective that it is not apartment that you own. And lots of people do charge their children rent. Honestly, you guys are both pretty lucky kids and I don\u2019t think either of your parents would be unreasonable to agree that that\u2019s still your living situation and not let either of you change it and make you work it out which is exactly what student dorms would do.", "NTA.

D will understand this in the future, you both are responsible for your end of the agreements.\n\nI have a friend who had a similar situation. My friend R was livening with Z and his boyfriend C. Although R had previously given me a key for emergencies to his apartment, Z was uncomfortable with that. R said that was fine, and a rule was created that only people on the lease can have a key. Cut to a few months later, R was home alone in the shower, and he heard a noise out in the apartment. It turns out that Z\u2019s friend S had come over unannounced and was doing her hair/makeup and had gotten personal key that Z had given her, without talking to R. R immediately talked to Z and demanded that he take back the key, citing the rule that was put in place due to Z\u2019s discomfort with me having a key. Z refused and R warned that there would be grave consequences if he did not take the key back. When Z continued to refuse claiming R was trying to break up Z\u2019s and S\u2019s friendship \ud83d\ude44, R immediately went down to the leasing office and asked to be moved into a one bedroom. Because R was paying a majority of the rent, because Z and C were unable to afford it, it equated to essentially kicking Z and C out, without formally kicking them out. Was it harsh, sure. Unwarranted, no. Z should have realized this was a possibility and considering their lease arrangement. \n\nR followed the rules, and applied them evenly without judgment. D should have as well. It was not you who requested A to stay. It was D. D is now responsible for A, as well as the extra living expenses incurred from A\u2019s stay. Its your house too, and D should respect that.

My sister had a very wise approach that, while she was the child of the owner - the Owner (our parents) were the landlord. She was VERY careful to separate some things as \"not her responsibility\" and \"Not her decision\" so that she did not have to get in fights with her roommates - it was simply \"I will have to ask my parents - it will be their decision.\"\n\nOf course - our parents would do whatever my sister suggested (within reason) - but - it made it so that if my sister made a suggestion that wasn't popular among the roommates - she could push the blame off on her parents. By unilaterally making a decision like you did - you lost that ability to save the friendship by blaming your parents for issues.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that - it is none of your roommate's business how much \"Rent\" you pay if you are managing the apartment for your parents - all that is their business is how much THEIR rent is - and what their rental contract says. This is especially important when you are giving them a good deal and below market rent: and bear in mind that your recourse against them is to charge them market rent - or advertise the room to someone who will pay market rent.\n\nAlso - My approach was different than my sisters: She always rented to friends (which meant there was more drama). I always rented to strangers - so - I had much less emotional attachment if they were 'mad' at me and they had much less emotional attachment to being treated \"fairly\" at a friend. My former roommates have become friends and we have stayed in touch after they've moved out - but - when we were roommates - I was their landlord/property manager and they showed me the respect expected of a landlord.\n\nI do want to warn you - your eviction of your friend & tenant sounds illegal - and they can likely sue you.

And then had the nerve to say \u201c I\u2019m not moving out. \u201c\n\nEventually she did, but it was a nightmare. It gave me trust issues around money for years.", "Sounds like D never thought of the increase in utility bills from having A there, and knew her dad would be mad when he found out. Instead of asking A to help pay, she decided to lash out at OP.\n\nOP, NTA.  You probably should have run it by your parents first, but I think you handled it well.", "Yup. Easy to share if you don\u2019t need to pay for what you are sharing. I was baffled by OPs roommate\u2019s behavior because she sounds like an entitled toddler who is just pissed that it\u2019s not her (parents) place. I wonder how does D\u2019s mind work. If you invite someone to stay for a month (without OPs consent) and usually split the bills two ways.. then either you should split the bill three ways and pay for 2/3 or let the guest pay her share. Why would she blame OP for that bill and take it out on OP  when her dad is pissed at her? She needs to learn how the real world works. \nHowever OP shouldn\u2019t call it her apartment before it\u2019s officially hers. Kind of weird tho that the bill almost doubled considering that OP was away for a week and OPs own guest only stayed for two days.", "I don't get why D didn't just ask A to chip in, sure they were having a bad time but chipping in towards living costs would be the right thing to do for the people helping you.", "> people are too soft and illogical these days.\n\nYeah clearly a modern problem :eyeroll:", "She did know, but from what I've gathered had the impression I was approving of her staying that long.

She owns it.", "I know this info is crucial but I had well over 3k words with it so I wasn't allowed to post, but wanted to say my parents aren't hit financially with this, they used those 300e to pay my own share of the bills so they had 0 income from her renting. They were undercharging her because of me (I asked for her to move in instead of living alone) and our parents know eachother relatively well. They also, by their own will, do not accept that i pay them rent or pay bills, instead asked me to find a flexible job for experience and personal spending so I can focus on my studies.", "It was more than a 30 day notice, I failed to mention I live in eastern Europe so our semesters start in october, so i gave her half of august and the whole september to figure it out.", "We had a mutual policy to pay for our own respective guests, but since I didn't mind A's presence at all and because she never makes a mess, pays for her food and is generally respectful I didn't even suggest that D should pay for A's part and thought we'd split it evenly between ourselves", "I didn't even think of this if I'm being honest. That's actually really smart.", "The apartment is in OPs name and the damage deposit was hers. Her parents just help with the mortgage payments. So yeah, it is her \u201cplace\u201d", "I told A to leave the apartment so I can speak to D alone, I didn't want to involve anyone in our business. I have no ill feelings towards A, even though she wasn't my friendy she was D's, I genuinely really liked her and enjoyed her company. The problem was that D expexted me to pay for HER guest, while I made it clear since the beginning that there's no problem inviting anyone to stay, but we have to pay for our respective friends. I did apologoze to A for being rude, and told her none of it is her fault and that she isn't a burden, just collateral damage from an existing problem.", "The apartment is in my name, bills get payed in my name, morgage gets payed in my name all from a bank account in my name. My parents just pay for all of it, in my name, which is why I call them the true owners by principle lol", "In legal terms, it is my apartment, it's in my name. But my parents pay for everything regarding it by putting money in a bank account also in my name. By principle, i call them the owners because i contribute nothing to it financially.", "Like I said over and over again, both of us come from working class parents. Property in Eastern Europe was cheap some years ago. University is free here if you do well enough on entry exams. Have a sense of grace to not let your imagination run wild when deciding critically at least. I don't know where the idea of either of us being anything more than middle class comes from.", "I replied to her and told her she personally had nothing to do with the whole ordeal, and apologized for being rude and giving the impression that she was the problem", "Just curious. If your parents feel it wasn't your decision to make, would they have preferred you just continued living with this toxic individual or did they just expect you to ask for their permission first?", "Yeah my HS best friend and I lived together for 2 years. It was a horrible decision, we were both right and in the wrong about our conflicts. In the end we got into a fist fight and finally moved out.\n\nGood news. After no contact for a few years we started seeing each other through mutual friends. Slowly over rekindled our friendship and now 12 years after we lived together our friendship is solid, I wouldn't say we are best friends but we are good friends.

Move on and study well", "It\u2019s done and sorted. Move on and study well", "It's not really ops money either...\n\nSounds like roomie's parents were close family friends. This has likely damaged the relationship between the parents.  OP needed to discuss the situation with her parents - not act unilaterally. \n\nMaybe roomate still would have had to move out but all the parents would have the straight story. This way there likely wouldn't be a rift between them even if roomate/op friendship is done.\n\nIf you're going to heavily rely on your parents financially, the least you can do is be considerate of them.", "The parents coming down on her for making the call feels like bad faith criticism though. They agree she made the right call, just don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve made it. \n\nThey raised this person, instilled into them your knowledge and empathy as best they could. OP were put into a difficult situation and handled pretty much exactly how her parents would have handled it, dealing with a complex situation head on and deftly instead of running to them to fix it.
