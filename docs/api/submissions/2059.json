I wanted them to be pissed that neither of them stood with me at all. Not even as groomsmen. AH move. I know.\n\nThe day of my wedding was great until he left. He gave quite the emotional best man speech. Brought me to tears if I'm being honest.\n\nThe family kept approaching him but he's always been shy. He said hi to some of them but he seemed out of his element. I kept trying to stay with him as much as I could. He, my wife, and his fianc\u00e9e really hit it off. I was glad. When he excused himself to grab some champagne, I saw our mom approach him, and immediately got worried.\n\nI'd already felt horrible about all the stuff he went through when we were younger, and didn't want him to know the real reason why he was the best man. Our mom kept talking to him, but I couldn't hear what she was saying.\n\nHe suddenly looked shocked, and asked me if he was only the best man to make our other siblings pissed. I said yes, I'm not the best liar. I kept apologizing and begging him to forgive me. All of this was away from the guests.\n\nI never said he wasn't getting invited. Our mom did. His invite was one of the first to go out.\n\nHe didn't make a scene, but he did leave with his fianc\u00e9e, everyone saw them leaving and kept questioning us why he left, including my wife. I told her the truth and she got very mad at our mom. The whole atmosphere was awkward from that point on.\n\nI did text him after the wedding. I told him he could've just stayed and then we would've chatted later. But he said that he didn't want to talk to me and blocked me.\n\nThe real AH is mostly our mom.\n\nOur sister sent me his post and told me to look at the comments, I was getting bashed left and right.
