He gave quite the emotional best man speech. Brought me to tears if I'm being honest.\n\nThe family kept approaching him but he's always been shy. He said hi to some of them but he seemed out of his element. I kept trying to stay with him as much as I could. He, my wife, and his fianc\u00e9e really hit it off. I was glad. When he excused himself to grab some champagne, I saw our mom approach him, and immediately got worried.\n\nI'd already felt horrible about all the stuff he went through when we were younger, and didn't want him to know the real reason why he was the best man. Our mom kept talking to him, but I couldn't hear what she was saying.\n\nHe suddenly looked shocked, and asked me if he was only the best man to make our other siblings pissed. I said yes, I'm not the best liar. I kept apologizing and begging him to forgive me. All of this was away from the guests.\n\nI never said he wasn't getting invited. Our mom did. His invite was one of the first to go out.\n\nHe didn't make a scene, but he did leave with his fianc\u00e9e, everyone saw them leaving and kept questioning us why he left, including my wife. I told her the truth and she got very mad at our mom. The whole atmosphere was awkward from that point on.\n\nI did text him after the wedding. I told him he could've just stayed and then we would've chatted later. But he said that he didn't want to talk to me and blocked me.\n\nThe real AH is mostly our mom.\n\nOur sister sent me his post and told me to look at the comments, I was getting bashed left and right.

Imagine how excited you would've been to think you're thought of so highly. *ESPECIALLY* if you've had a difficult childhood with members of that side of the family.

I\u2019m so sorry he had to go through this but he\u2019s very lucky to have you by his side. Keep him close and the rest of his AH family far away!!", "Don't pick OP for best man!", "I hope you both have the wedding of your dreams and keep his AH family far away from him!!", "I'm so happy he has you, and your family.\n\nI know he's in a lot of pain. My husband had an absolute shitty family. His mom always played favorites. His brother was the golden child. Until brother got married and she then decided my hubby was her golden ticket. He paid her rent, bought her furniture and appliances, paid her bills, etc... Her love was absolutely conditional. When I came along, she pretended to like me at first. But then I got pregnant. She made it her mission to break us up. She would tell him, daily that I was baby trapping him and baby wasn't his. She would tell her family I was manipulative, using him for his money (even tho I made more), etc... It was a nightmare. Then she wouldn't talk to him because he wasn't giving her as much money. So now the brother was the golden child again. There were times my husband saw his mom for the manipulative, selfish, mean person she was. However, there was a big part of him that over looked her actions because he wanted to feel her love and acceptance. He tried so hard too. It broke my heart. I cannot tell you the number of times I cried because of the things they did to him, and the way they made him feel. My husband was way too forgiving when it came to his family. To him, their treatment was normal. He would tell me to \"be the bigger person\" and \"this is just how they are\". It finally ended tho when his mom was mean to our child. In that moment, he knew his mom was an awful person who would never change. He stopped trying. For over 3 years we did not hear from his mom, grandparents, or aunt. My husband unexpectedly passed away from undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. I sent one of hubby's best friends to tell her. She never once asked about our kids...nor did she ever reach out. I invited her, and her son, to the mortuary to help make arrangements, and they never showed up. I had a complete breakdown in the mortuary restroom. I ugly cried for close to an hour. I was so pist that even in death they made absolutely no effort to be there for him. Some people just truly suck! Sometimes it's better to just completely cut them out of our lives. I'll never forget the time my mom called. This was early in our relationship. My hubby asked what she needed. I said she just called to see how we were. He just looked at me and asked \"how does it feel?\". I was confused and asked him to explain. He asked what it was like to have family that love you enough to just call and check on you. That his family only calls when they want something. If they didn't need anything from him, they would never call. That hurt on so many levels. My husband was hands down the most amazing person. He was incredibly strong and caring. He never met a person he didn't like. He could meet a complete stranger and within minutes they would feel like they were talking to their best friend. It's sad that his family never realized what a great man he was. I know it is their loss. But it's heartbreakingly sad that he was so hurt but then and it affected him his whole life.\n\nI'm so grateful your fiance has you. Just continue to tell him he is loved and that he is enough. He has some nothing wrong. His \"family\" is punishing him for things out of his control and there's no excuse for that.", "You sound amazing! I hope you guys have a very happy life ahead", "Sadly doesn\u2019t appear that OP really cares what people have to say.  After seeing your responses the usual cowardly Reddit OPs would\u2019ve deleted their post hours ago."]}
