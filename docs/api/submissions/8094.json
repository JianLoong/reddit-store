We live in the same town as my parents, and she's become close with them.\n\nShortly after I met my gf, my twin brother (who I'm very close with) proposed to his girlfriend of 3 years - let's call her Ananya. The wedding later this year is going to be a small Indian wedding (250-300 people). My gf wants to come to celebrate with my family, and my parents and I all want her to come as well. My parents are also paying for a large fraction of the wedding. I asked my brother if I could invite her, and he was ok with it but said I would have to ask Ananya myself.\n\nOne piece of context here is that a few months ago I was concerned that my own relationship was moving too quickly and I confided in my brother and Ananya about this. Even though my certainty in my own relationship has grown, Ananya has doubts as to whether I'm serious about my relationship.\n\nAnanya said that she doesn't want my gf there. She said they don't know her well enough (they've only met her once, because they've been busy with wedding planning) and that this wedding \"has nothing to do with her\". Ananya is also concerned that my gf will become the focus of the wedding and detract from her special day. Finally, she's offended that my girlfriend would even assume that she would be invited in the first place. My brother has told me that Ananya feels like my parents already know my gf better than they know her (by virtue of us living in the same town) and that this makes her uncomfortable.\n\nMy mom got involved and told Ananya this decision could have long-term impacts on our long-term family dynamic, as my gf might resent Ananya for not including her in this family event. Ananya feels like this is unreasonable and that her decision is final. She also doesn't want me to tell my girlfriend that this was Ananya's decision, as she doesn't want to create tension in our family.\n\nI'm upset that my future sister-in-law isn't letting my girlfriend attend. Would I be the asshole for wanting to be honest to my girlfriend to keep Ananya accountable for her decision? I know this might create tension in our family in the future, but I want her to know that everybody else is excited about the possibility of her joining us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  \nA wedding size of 300 is considered small for Indian weddings. Our families are both large, and the rule they've set is that only spouses and engaged-to-be-married partners are automatically invited.

I have a hard time believing that she knows everyone going well enough.
