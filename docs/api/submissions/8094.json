We live in the same town as my parents, and she's become close with them.\n\nShortly after I met my gf, my twin brother (who I'm very close with) proposed to his girlfriend of 3 years - let's call her Ananya. The wedding later this year is going to be a small Indian wedding (250-300 people). My gf wants to come to celebrate with my family, and my parents and I all want her to come as well. My parents are also paying for a large fraction of the wedding. I asked my brother if I could invite her, and he was ok with it but said I would have to ask Ananya myself.\n\nOne piece of context here is that a few months ago I was concerned that my own relationship was moving too quickly and I confided in my brother and Ananya about this. Even though my certainty in my own relationship has grown, Ananya has doubts as to whether I'm serious about my relationship.\n\nAnanya said that she doesn't want my gf there. She said they don't know her well enough (they've only met her once, because they've been busy with wedding planning) and that this wedding \"has nothing to do with her\". Ananya is also concerned that my gf will become the focus of the wedding and detract from her special day. Finally, she's offended that my girlfriend would even assume that she would be invited in the first place. My brother has told me that Ananya feels like my parents already know my gf better than they know her (by virtue of us living in the same town) and that this makes her uncomfortable.\n\nMy mom got involved and told Ananya this decision could have long-term impacts on our long-term family dynamic, as my gf might resent Ananya for not including her in this family event. Ananya feels like this is unreasonable and that her decision is final. She also doesn't want me to tell my girlfriend that this was Ananya's decision, as she doesn't want to create tension in our family.\n\nI'm upset that my future sister-in-law isn't letting my girlfriend attend. Would I be the asshole for wanting to be honest to my girlfriend to keep Ananya accountable for her decision? I know this might create tension in our family in the future, but I want her to know that everybody else is excited about the possibility of her joining us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  \nA wedding size of 300 is considered small for Indian weddings. Our families are both large, and the rule they've set is that only spouses and engaged-to-be-married partners are automatically invited.

You may call it small but a lot of people consider it a large wedding. We aren't Indian though, lol.", "It actually sounds like the future in laws are steam rolling her into what they want for her wedding.", "Well you aren\u2019t as close as you think if he won\u2019t allow your serious girlfriend to attend the wedding with you.", "If it\u2019s a rule than yes ywbta to push it further.", "So from Ananya's perspective, you want yourGF of one year to be an exception to the +1 rule, even though your relationship (as far as she knows) isn't even that solid? I think Ananya's being very reasonable here, personally.", "If Ananya is \"allowing\" your family to invite a few cousins and close friends, why can't your GF be included in your family's list of close friends to receive an invite? They know her well, want her there, and should also get to invite who they want. Your SIL-to-be is the TA with petty excuses.", "Oh the edit with the rule makes it very clear she isn\u2019t the only non-engaged/married partner going, so she isn\u2019t the only one AND her going could piss off others who followed the rule. \n\nOP YWBTA for saying FSIL doesn\u2019t want her going, YWNBTA if you told her the truth the same rule applies to her as it does to all other guests who aren\u2019t engaged/married to their partner.", "Why doesn\u2019t mom insist that she\u2019s invited? She\u2019s paying for 300 guests ffs.", "I think the proper thing is to invite her as a guest not in the wedding party. That\u2019s correct for the length of their relationship. To not invite her would be shocking. For one, wedding party members get an automatic guest. Second, if she refuses to consider a relationship of a year serious, the same rule has to be applied to every other guest. Last, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s jealous and attention seeking. Your brother should put his foot down if he wants your partners to have a decent relationship in the future. He should be the one to talk sense into her", "I feel like this is a huge cultural element that people need to consider before making a judgment.", "Did no one else read where the bride didn't want OP's girlfriend to come because girlfriend might get more attention than her??????  Seriously, f'ing deranged brides there days!  \nOP, I would tell your girlfriend the truth.  NTA.  I respect honesty more than most anything else.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d tell Ananya first that you do take your gf seriously and can\u2019t start with a lie. Make sure Amanda knows it\u2019s not for lack of solidarity with her or tarnishing how you support her as a SIL, but to be fair to both women it\u2019s better to be honest.\n\nThat said Ananya is clearly jealousy and insecure, she\u2019s better off doing what she can stand for publicly.\n\nAlso note, in many cases not pointing fingers is a solidarity thing, she may feel by naming her you\u2019re hanging her out to dry. The way you said \u2018hold her accountable\u2019 is that. Hence my suggestion - focus on the impact to your relationship if you lied. How would she feel if the tables were turned?", "Your GF isn't invited.  Why would you need to explain this to her or talk about the reasons, and create tension?  No one should expect to attend a wedding until they are invited.  All your GF needs to know is that she wasn't invited.  Don't make a big deal out of this, or else it will become a big deal.", "NTA but you have to tell her that SIL doesn\u2019t want her there. She sounds super jealous of your girlfriend", "NTA. Ananya sucks. What a bridezilla. Your twin should stand up for you.", "Sounds like she's jealous of your girlfriend.", "Just a small wedding of over 250 people, all of whom have a deep personal connection with the people getting married?\n\nYTA", "Ananya can say no to your gf attending but she's out of line for insisting that you not tell your gf it was her decision because she's asking you to lie (even by omission) to cover for her which is an awful thing to do. \n\nYWNBTA if you tell her the truth.", "NTA. You have to tell your gf the truth. It roll come out later and backfire on you if you don\u2019t.", "Tell your gf the truth.", "You have to tell your GF that this was all Ananya's decision. Be prepared however for Ananya to tell your GF sometime in the future when this comes up that 'oh, I didn't think you guys were serious, OP himself had doubts about it.' So when you tell your gf, tip her off as to a bit of the background.\n\nAnanya will just have to deal with the consequences of a strained relationship. Your girlfriend is going to be a bit hurt regardless.", "NTA. BUT: give Ananya the heads-up that you will not be lying about why your girlfriend is not invited. She can make her choices AND own them. She might change her tune then...", "People absolutely will make up that kind of  rule especially to exclude one person with looking like they\u2019re TA when it comes to weddings.", "Twin brother of the groom doesn\u2019t get a plus 1? How is that reasonable?\n\nNTA"]}
