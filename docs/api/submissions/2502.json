Kind of hard to find unbiased opinions irl so I figured I\u2019d turn here. \n\nI (29M) had a kid with my ex-wife (32F) 10 years ago, my daughter. And there\u2019s no real way to sugarcoat this but as soon as she was born, I left and I never ended up seeing her in the hospital as a baby. Was never really present in her life at any point but ended up getting a divorce 11 months later with her getting full custody of course. I married young, was really stupid and thought I\u2019d end up being a good dad despite no skills but got scared that I\u2019d turn out like my dad and chickened out. Not really an excuse but an explanation I guess. I paid child support for the first 3 years but stopped afterwards.\n\nI\u2019ve been speaking with the girl\u2019s mother about reconnecting with her, but she thinks it\u2019s best that I stay out of their lives majorly. But I think making amends is always possible so I\u2019m not sure, I just really want to make things right but I will respect their decision. I\u2019ve seen her a few times but her mother has always introduced me as a friend. She says she will tell her when she is ready. \n\nI\u2019ve been dating a girl (28F) for about 10 months, and I really like her. I think I could definitely see a life for us and I know that sounds weird but she\u2019s also said the same. I was also speaking to my daughter\u2019s mother about meeting this girl, but she says absolutely not and that\u2019s a bad idea. But if I want to reintroduce her into my life isn\u2019t it fair that she gets to see my life too?\n\nAITA for this? Her mother says it\u2019s a very bad idea, so it\u2019s making me think I am but I just genuinely cannot see why. Obviously I care for this girl and I will care for her life too, but a relationship has to be two-sided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to show her my life too.", "created_utc": 1668642103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxa52c/aita_for_wanting_my_daughter_to_meet_my/", "score": 9430, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're lucky your ex is willing to even let you spend any time whatsoever with your daughter.\n\nWhat's your real reason for trying to push so hard for her to meet your girlfriend? Is this about her wanting to meet the daughter maybe?

It is very common and also a very good idea to keep kids out of a parent's dating life until there is a more permanent commitment. If you want to build a relationship with your daughter, *you* need to spend time with her, not your girlfriend. The fact that you keep refering to this 28-year-old woman as a girl raises some red flags.

Both of those mean she is not someone you really want around your daughter.", "YTA.  I hope this isnt real.

Kind of hard to find unbiased opinions irl so I figured I\u2019d turn here. \n\nI (29M) had a kid with my ex-wife (32F) 10 years ago, my daughter. And there\u2019s no real way to sugarcoat this but as soon as she was born, I left and I never ended up seeing her in the hospital as a baby. Was never really present in her life at any point but ended up getting a divorce 11 months later with her getting full custody of course. I married young, was really stupid and thought I\u2019d end up being a good dad despite no skills but got scared that I\u2019d turn out like my dad and chickened out. Not really an excuse but an explanation I guess. I paid child support for the first 3 years but stopped afterwards.\n\nI\u2019ve been speaking with the girl\u2019s mother about reconnecting with her, but she thinks it\u2019s best that I stay out of their lives majorly. But I think making amends is always possible so I\u2019m not sure, I just really want to make things right but I will respect their decision. I\u2019ve seen her a few times but her mother has always introduced me as a friend. She says she will tell her when she is ready. \n\nI\u2019ve been dating a girl (28F) for about 10 months, and I really like her. I think I could definitely see a life for us and I know that sounds weird but she\u2019s also said the same. I was also speaking to my daughter\u2019s mother about meeting this girl, but she says absolutely not and that\u2019s a bad idea. But if I want to reintroduce her into my life isn\u2019t it fair that she gets to see my life too?\n\nAITA for this? Her mother says it\u2019s a very bad idea, so it\u2019s making me think I am but I just genuinely cannot see why. Obviously I care for this girl and I will care for her life too, but a relationship has to be two-sided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to show her my life too.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
