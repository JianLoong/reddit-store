Back at the start of the pregnancy which was a complete accident (my partner was taking the contraceptive pill) we did not think we could keep the pregnancy and needed an abortion. We both love each other and have been together 12 years, but we weren\u2019t planning on having a baby for another 5/6 years as we are saving for a house. When we found out we where pregnant her parents came to see us, who we have always had a very poor relationship with as her mum is a scheming controlling manipulative individual so keeping her at a distance is what\u2019s best, and for the first time ever she genuinely seemed to care. She listened to everything we said, tried to give us some advice, pampered my partner and looked after her, and together we all agreed the only thing missing in our family puzzle is the security owning a house, but sadly for me and my partner is was too big a piece of the puzzle and we where going to get an abortion and wait a few years before trying for a baby. The next morning my partners mother says I\u2019ve come up with a plan, I\u2019m going to move some finances around and sell some things off and I\u2019m going to give you enough for a deposit, and all your childcare! Because I want to help you both and you deserve a family. We where ecstatic, it fixed everything for us and meant we could have our family now and give this baby the life we want. WE WHERE FOOLS. 8 months later we now know the entire thing was a lie to get us give her a grandchild, because after numerous lies, numerous weeks/months of no contact, now she\u2019s manipulating my partners other family members against us saying she never promised us any of this, we now know that there never was any money, she just lied so we wouldn\u2019t get an abortion and she could be a grandmother. Having talked I persuaded my partner to completely and utterly stop them from ever seeing our baby, as they have been brought into the world on a complete lie. Her mum won\u2019t ever get to be a grandparent. Is this fair?

Sounds like you pressured your partner rather than convinced her TBH.", "So you decided to go through with the pregnancy cause you thought someone would give you money. \nYeah so that is just plain dumb. You can't financially raise a baby on your own and decided to do it anyway cause someone else was footing the bill. Yeah YTA", "ESH except for the pregnant lady. You pressured her to keep a baby neither of you wanted, based on the promise of money from somebody you both know is a manipulative liar. Jesus christ, what did you actually expect to happen?", "ESH. Yes your MIL lied to you and that was shady and absolutly sh\\*t. But if your partner wants/need the contact don't pressure her to go non contact. I see your point, why you don't want your inlaws to have any contact with the baby. But in the end you should discuse it with your partner not with strangers on the internet. If she is okay with it, yes it would be the best to cut of those liars from your life. But if your partner needs/want them, don't say that she should never meet them again. Best to do is to talk with your partner about this situation - most likly more than ones as she could be hormonal do to pregnancy and giving birth and could change her view on topics like this depending on this a little bit often.", "YTA because you just want revenge, you are not thinking about what is best for your baby. Oh and btw are you not excited about the baby? Are you wishing she had told you the truth so that you had had an abortion?

So you're calling OP an asshole for something he never actually said or did?", "how would it in baby\u2019s best interest to be around people who lie? and how can it be exciting to have plans pulled from under you and now have to scramble extra because they lied about giving you help. are you okay in the head ?"]}
