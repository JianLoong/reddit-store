You can't financially raise a baby on your own and decided to do it anyway cause someone else was footing the bill. Yeah YTA", "[deleted]", "ESH. Yes your MIL lied to you and that was shady and absolutly sh\\*t. But if your partner wants/need the contact don't pressure her to go non contact. I see your point, why you don't want your inlaws to have any contact with the baby. But in the end you should discuse it with your partner not with strangers on the internet. If she is okay with it, yes it would be the best to cut of those liars from your life. But if your partner needs/want them, don't say that she should never meet them again. Best to do is to talk with your partner about this situation - most likly more than ones as she could be hormonal do to pregnancy and giving birth and could change her view on topics like this depending on this a little bit often.", "YTA because you just want revenge, you are not thinking about what is best for your baby. Oh and btw are you not excited about the baby? Are you wishing she had told you the truth so that you had had an abortion?

So you're calling OP an asshole for something he never actually said or did?", "how would it in baby\u2019s best interest to be around people who lie? and how can it be exciting to have plans pulled from under you and now have to scramble extra because they lied about giving you help. are you okay in the head ?", "I would really recommend a closed adoption. It seems that neither you nor your partner is ready for a child. It might be the best for your baby, to have people in its life who really want them.", "Why do you wonder if you would be the asshole? Did somebody say it to you, is there a voice _deep down_? And INFO: Where are your parents in this situation?\n\nAnyhow, while the situation is shitty, I would go for ESH. Your MIL obviously, for lying, but you too!\nThroughout your question, you put lots of emphasis on money and your feelings, but what does your partner feel about this situation? And you \"persuading her by talking\", did she really get involved or did you get back to it over and over again (which I honestly think because you to about persuasive talking in the same sentence construction twice) and she was done talking about it? Did she need persuasion, or did she actually need support while se carries the baby you both contributed to?\n\nThat being said, check with your partner how she feels about this situation, what she envisioned the grandparent role (from both sides) for your upcoming child. Keep your opinions to yourself until she asks for it. Eventually, if that differs, make some solid agreements on boundaries and stick to it. If that means you go no contact with your in-laws, go ahead, but if your partner is not on the same page, accept it.", "NTA.

Too bad you can\u2019t get that kind of thing in writing", "NTA. As a parent, your most important job is to keep your child safe and raise them in a healthy environment.

So you only had the baby because someone was paying you? Poor kid. You're both AHs", "NTA she really tricked you into bringing a human into this world when you couldn\u2019t afford to. That\u2019s insane. Your partner is going to need therapy but you should absolutely limit contact with your partners mother.", "NTA wow Well that didn\u2019t work for her. And sadly she even laid out a plan that sounded good. She could have done something good and been a beloved grandmother. Now she gets nothing but scorn \nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you.

It's a lie.", "I know I am going to get downvoted to hell for this but YTA. This child isn\u2019t a lie, a lie was made up so the kid wouldn\u2019t die, just give the baby up for adoption instead of going nuclear on the grandmother.

Its not 100%.", "Happy cake day! \ud83c\udf82", "This!  If you were going to terminate because you weren\u2019t stable enough to have a baby and your in-laws lied to get you to have the baby, then your situation is the same as before.  You\u2019re still not stable enough to have this baby.  Closed adoption will give the baby a chance for a better home (and also a chance for a worse one, let\u2019s be real).   But also makes sure your in-laws won\u2019t be able to weasel their way into the kid\u2019s lives making all of you miserable.", "Sorry I don\u2019t agree.

What the hell is wrong with you??", "Pretty sure wanting to abort is an indication.

They aren't financially stable yet to raise a human.", "OP said numerous times in their post that the pregnancy was unexpected, they wanted to wait until they had a house (5-6 years from now), & both OP & partner wanted an abortion.

Even if they had a great relationship with MIL for their entire lives, what happens if she died suddenly or they had a argument and she stopped providing?\n\nI personally think NTA, but that\u2019s because I have compassion knowing OP and their partner probably really wanted to keep the baby and we\u2019re just trying to find a way for everything to work out.", "Persuading my partner is what\u2019s wrong here.

It looks like they already resent this baby before it's born. \n\n2.) OP makes their feelings and thoughts VERY clear but says nothing about how their partner feels. The only hint to partner's feelings is that OP claims they \"convinced\" their partner to go NC with MIL. OP uses the word \"convince\" and \"persuaded\" more than once. Meaning this isn't something that partner was comfortable with originally. Considering OP's partner is also the baby's parent AND the one birthing the child, her feelings matter. \n\n3.) Yes MIL sounds super manipulative, but that's not why OP wants to go NC, it's purely for spite because he's angry there's no money coming in. Yes it's shitty what MIL did, but he's not worried about baby or partners feelings, he wants to give MIL the finger so \"she doesn't get to be a grandma\". \n\n4.) Why is partner's whole family banned from seeing baby because MIL lied about the money? Meaning after giving birth and going through postpartum, OP'S partner will have NO support from her family?
