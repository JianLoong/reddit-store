I see your point, why you don't want your inlaws to have any contact with the baby. But in the end you should discuse it with your partner not with strangers on the internet. If she is okay with it, yes it would be the best to cut of those liars from your life. But if your partner needs/want them, don't say that she should never meet them again.
