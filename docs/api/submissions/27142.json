Henry is his wife's child and Aria is his affair partner's child.\n\nWhile he is a good dad to Henry he is a terrible dad to Aria. He is the every other weekend dad who does the bare minimum. Unfortunately Aria has a terrible mom too so she spends most of her time at my home. I love expriencing new things like new food, new activities, going to new cities.... and Aria has started to enjoy these too so a few times a week we like to try something new. She also has an instagram page that she posts everything she does.\n\nA few days ago my brother called me and said that Henry is upset that I never include him and asked if I could take Henry with me as well sometimes. That's when I lost it. I asked him if he seriously expects me to parent his son too while I basically had to adopt his daughter. I told him that frankly I don't care that Henry is feeling left out and I'm not going to include him in activities I do with my daughter.\n\nHe called me an asshole both for excluding Henry and refering to Aria as my daughter\n\nEdit: why is everyone acting like I'm completely ignoring Henry? I spend time with him, I go to some of his important basketball games, I call him whenever I have time and I buy him nice gifts for birthdays and christmas. Last month was his birthday and I bought him an expensive pair of headphones.

Like he sees one of those kids as his own and is the only adult in their life to be there for her while the other child has two loving parents and then one of those parents (who\u2019s also one of the people responsible for hurting the child op loves as his own) is like \u201cbut what about MY kid he is sad you should spoil him without even acknowledging the WHY of op having to step up like this. Like bffr. He didn\u2019t explode on the nephew, he exploded on the shitty dad, and I don\u2019t blame him. NTA op.", "Info - what\u2019s the kids relationship like. As in do they get along or what?", "I have a half brother my father completely abandoned. He's also in a wheelchair and gets 0 child support from my father. If my dads family chose to support him and not me I wouldn't care. I'm not close to anyone on my dads side and am much closer to my moms side. My half brother is also in a way worse spot than me, even though both our moms are single. My dad still makes an effort to see my brother and I, but has completely abandoned my half brother. I would completely understand why my half brother would need more support and love than I do from my dads extended family. \n\nIdk. I just think at 17 he should understand why Aria gets more love from you. She has no one else in her life. He can feel jealous sure, but he shouldn't be asking to go on trips too. \n\nI don't really think youre an asshole tbh. I think you're a great uncle/father figure to her. She doesn't even really have a mom... \n\nAlso, my mom's brothers have never taken me out on trips to new cities lol. They got me gadgets on holidays sure, but taking me on vacations? They're not my dad. I don't know why you have to take him. You do it for Aria because you think shes your daughter. You get him gifts because hes your nephew. Thats a normal uncle nephew relationship.\n\nI do think you do sound a bit annoyed about him in your replies to other people, but you may also just feel defensive.  I also hope her and her half brother can repair their relationship. It sounds like you mostly treat him like a nephew and nothing more. \n\nYou're not treating them equally, no. But its sort of like equity instead because Aria is in a way worse spot. If your brother can't understand that then maybe he should begin to be more equal to Aria...", "NTA\nY'all damn crazy.\nThe niece doesn't have anyone to care for her, hates the brother and has only op to rely on. Now, why he's supposed to ruin the only relationship that this poor girl has in favor of her brother, who has both parents that love and care for him?\nOP you're a great uncle and your niece is super lucky to have you in her life", "You are NTA at all and I don\u2019t understand any of these comments clearly none of these commenters have been the child in this situation and as someone who WAS aria please continue exactly what your doing. Henry gets two great parents while she gets nothing if she gets to see Henry also get you it will tear her apart. Don\u2019t listen to these people and keep being a good parent figure to her since she has no one.", "NTA\n\nNot your monkey not your circus. They're not your kids, you don't owe either of them your time. Aria is lucky to have you. Just don't be a dick to Henry about it.", "NTA you have a good uncle relationship with Henry but stepped up to a dad role for Aria. Nothing wrong with keeping it that way", "NTA ! Now your brother clearly sees how he treats Aria, you specifically give her the attention she doesn't get from her parents that Henry DOES (It seems like everyone is forgetting that Henry is their golden child, but since you're dealing with this weekly this isn't new to you) people screaming that it isn't fair to Henry are forgetting that Aria is missing out on BOTH her parents.", "Nta why? That kid has two loving parents Aria has none and you still do stuff with Henry but not as much as you do with Aria because Aria needed a parent you stepped up provided that. Not your job to make Henry happy if that was the case your brother needs to step up reimburse you for your help with HIS AFFAIR CHILD instead of being a great father to one child and be a crap father to the other. He should have more to do with Aria and make sure she's taken care of so you can spend more time with Henry.  What kind of parent doesn't make sure their kid has a decent place to live? Also regardless is Henry mom still in the picture if so I'm willing to bet that's why she can't Stay with them", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your brother is an idiot. Honestly maybe you should have a talk with Henry. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s fault that both children feel out of place", "NTA\n\nYou are not the person who decided to have the kids. So long as you are kind to Henry when you are in his presence, you owe him nothing more.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt sucks for the son, but guess what?\nYour brother CLEARLY wanted to keep him rather than HIS OWN daughter.\nHe virtually allowed you to adopt, raise, clothe, feed, school costs, basic care needs... But that's not enough, now take my other kid too? Ungrateful!\n\nYou're NOT punishing your nephew. Have your daughter block and private her pages from him and your brother on social media. They won't see the pictures of you raising his (YOUR) daughter, so feelings won't get hurt! Problem solved!\n\nPlus, if your brother brought up you raising his daughter only AFTER you spent a long time with her, who's to say he wouldn't also dump his son on you?  \"But you've bonded soooo much, take my other kid please!\"", "Nta. You love Aria and she loves you, so you spend a great deal of time together. She sees you as a dad and you see her as a daughter. I think its great that she has you. You aren't close to your brother or his son, so you spend less time with him. Makes sense to me. I spend more time with my sisters kids than I do with my brothers. I like my sis and her kids a lot better. Sorry, not sorry. You get to choose who to spend time with. Don't sweat it and enjoy your time with your daughter.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA and I\u2019m confused as to why people are upset with you. I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to spend more time with your niece since you know she doesn\u2019t get as much attention as your nephew. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s your responsibility to explain why you choose to approach the situation like this. At the end of the day your brother should be the one trying to fix all of this.", "NTA. From what I've read you're only compensating your niece since your brother basically doesn't care about her. Agree with your comment that your nephew will survive not being everyone's favorite. Your nephew already monopolizes his parents time attention. Its okay to treat your niece as your child since she needs to be someone's priority as well. If you do the bare minimum like bday and xmas gifts for nephew then its fair", "honestly I\u2019m going against all the comments but I don\u2019t think you are a ahole here\u2026 or it\u2019s a situation to me where it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a ahole or not.\n\nIf you see Aria as you actual child then it\u2019s normal that you love her more then any other niece or nephew.\n\nAnd even though it might be sad for Henry you aren\u2019t obligated to love or spend time with him if you don\u2019t want to same for Aria and you don\u2019t have to but you did and now you need to stay in her life if you consider her your daughter and vice versa it\u2019s a forever commitment so take this seriously.\n\nAnd expect for parents and grandparents (imo) relatives are not obligated to love each other and it\u2019s sad yea especially when the favouritism is shown but in this situation it isn\u2019t who is more important nephew Vs niece.  \nIt more like nephew Vs daughter so if your daughter is first and that\u2019s fine.\n\nPs: sorry if it\u2019s messy English is my third language and have ADHD", "NTA. He wants you to take care of Henry as well. Well, I\u2019ll be darned, I bet you wish he\u2019d take care of Aria but I guess nobody really gets what they want. Why he doesn\u2019t see this is beyond me.", "NTA and lol at the ESH or YTA responses. Good on you for taking care of Aria. I hope the two of you will have a great lifelong relationship. Your brother can go pound sand.\n\nEdit: furthermore, it\u2019s not like OP is actively excluding the nephew. The niece who has been effectively abandoned by her father is spending time with her aunt. He never said anything bad to Henry\u2019s face, just told his brother off for being insensitive to Aria\u2019s needs and advocating for his favorite child.", "Do you 2 consider each other father daughter? If you both do then that makes you he parent. Ink and blood doesn't make a family. \n\n\nShe is your daughter in all the ways that matter and of course your daughter who lives with you is going to be treated differently than a nephew.", "You \u201cinclude\u201d Aria because she has no one else.  You\u2019ve basically adopted her.  Your brother, who\u2019s Aria\u2019s father, excludes her twelve of every 14 days.\n\nIf Aria is living with you and you are acting as her parent, then Henry has no real reason to be jealous.  NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like he does plenty with Henry.", "As a middle child who had an older brother who was my mom's favorite, and a little sister who was my dad's favorite.  Thank you for existing and being you're awesome self. If it wasn't for my aunt stepping in to do what you're doing life would have been way shittier for me", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here. Family relationships like this are very complicated. I have cousins my parents basically adopted and we all know who actually parented them. You taking on Henry would just alleviate your brother of more of his responsibility.", "NTA. Sounds like Henry is living his best life with both his parents and Aria only gets to see her Dad every other weekend and it\u2019s not the best time and the 12 days she has with her mom suck too. And OP does stuff for Henry just not as much as OP does for Aria because Arias actual parents aren\u2019t doing for her like Henry\u2019s parents are for him. The only AH here is Henry and Aria\u2019s father", "I mean. Ideally each kid would have full parenting. But as far as who is doing the parenting, Aria has you and Henry has his dad. Your brother SHOULD be parenting both of them, but aria is lucky to have you step up and be a parent for her. Objectively, Aria is your daughter, and Henry is your nephew, regardless of what blood says. I say NTA", "NTA - For Aria, she\u2019s spending time with the only person who treats her as their child, a parent figure. For Henry, he just wants to go on paid vacation. I would be more sympathetic if he wants to spend time with you, not just go fun trips.", "NTA you are doing what is right for you and for Aria. Henry has his parents. If he wants those experiences then he can ask his Daddy and Mommy.", "NTA. I don't know what's wrong with the comments but seriously guys. Henry has two loving parents. Aria has none. Uncle stepped up and that's bothered you??\n\nFather asked to include his favourite in those trips OP refused no matter what the situation NO is NO. \n\nAs simple as it is OP has the right to choose where and to whom he is spending his time and money on.\n\nHenry gets the attention of two adults but it is upsetting when Aria gets to have one. ???\n\nHenry is entitled as the picture shows. It's either he gets all or well 2 and Aria gets nothing.\n\nOP for this headache to be over just tell Henry and your bother at some point  \"That's I'm sorry. But I can't include you in these trips because one I don't have the budget for that and two I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing if your father had done his role as a good father for Aria.\"\n\nRegarding OP calling Aria his daughter. Well if he feels that connection none here has the right to judge that. He is parenting her while 2 of her living parents aren't. Y'all need to be thankful.", "NTA.  Maybe look into actually adopting Aria, though.", "NTA. You are Aria's dad, not Henry's. Clearly your brother doesn't include Aria in everything (or anything), so why would you include Henry?", "So, NTA, but I feel compelled to point out two things- it\u2019s not Henry\u2019s fault his dad is useless, and maybe he\u2019d like to get to know his sister better. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to include him once or twice a month. You\u2019re still his uncle, and you\u2019re caring for his sister. When does he see her? \n\nNo, it\u2019s not your responsibility to parent these kids, but you could bring a little light and happiness to their lives by including him once in a while.", "Info how has Henry treated Aria in the past? you talk about your brother being a shit father to Aria which clearly makes him an AH and you have talked about Henry being spoiled in some comments and you have also said Aria hate Henry.\n\nIs this just because Henry gets the picture perfect family with a mother and father that seemingly spoil him or was he actively bad to her in the past and treated her badly because she is the affair child?\n\nThis really determines it for me because if Henry just been kinda spoiled but neutral to Aria then its probably ESH but if he has been actively horrible to Aria then its NTA.", "NTA nice that she has you in her life.", "I mean, your brother is overall a giant AH for how he treats his kids, but I think you need to reframe this request.  \n\nYour brother was not calling to ask you to do something *for him*.  He was asking you to do something for *Henry*.  And as big of an AH as your brother is, Henry isn't an AH.  He's a kid who didn't ask to be a part of this mess.  Henry is a kid who sees you doing things with his sister that you don't do with him.  Henry is a kid who loves you too and wants special time with you too.  Henry is a kid who is feeling left out by his own family.  Your brother deserves what he gets, but did *Henry* deserve this?  Does Henry deserve to be pushed aside by a relative just because his dad sucks?\n\nNo, he doesn't.  And you're an AH for not caring about the fact that a child, your nephew, is hurt by your behavior.  Put all those high horses you rode in on back in the stable.  You only have the high road when it comes to your brother.  NOT when it comes to the innocent children who are not at fault for this situation.  \n\nESH except for the kids", "NTA and I've actually been in a similar-ish situation. My sister lived with my aunt during my mom and dad''s divorce for a few years. They are naturally much closer than me and my aunt are. And that's normal. Not \"favoritism\". Everyone saying he's choosing his niece over his nephew blah blah blah blah is not looking at the actual situation. OP is raising Aria. She calls him her dad. He thinks of her as his daughter. It's not niece vs nephew it's daughter vs nephew. Of COURSE he spends more time with the girl he considers his daughter. It would be way weirder if it was the other way around. But you guys are hung up on the technicalities. Who cares if he isn't her biodad and hasn't legally adopted her. He's taking care of her, he loves her. Why do the legal/bio definitions of their relationship matter to you guys more than the ones they BOTH use???", "Nta nephew has a stable life all aria has is op", "ESH.  Aria is lucky to have someone who is there for her.  But, you are exactly your brother.  You feel so much for Aria that you treat Henry the same way your brother treats Ara.  Have you ever heard that two wrongs don't make a right?  You COULD be the person that ensures these two siblings grow up with a good relationship.  Eventually, they will be strangers now, thanks to both you and your brother being gigantic assholes.", "ESH.  Brother sucks for being a terrible parent.  You suck because children that are your relatives want to spend time with you and you rejected one of them.  Take the opportunity to improve your relationship with your nephew who apparently wants to have a relationship with you.\n\nFocus your anger on your brother who deserves it.", "NTA. You're totally right, it isn't your responsibility to parent his son too. What he's asking is unfair, and you don't owe him this when he doesn't even bother with Aria on a regular basis. His expectations are ridiculous and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about standing up for yourself.", "NTA - you say ni\u00e8ce even refers to you as her father, so you are her father figure in her life and essentially her only present parental figure. If we then imagine this as two brothers who have their own children, then this is an insane request. My cousins go on many vacations with their families and include none of the cousins, similarly I go on trips with my father and we invite none of my cousins. Unless your brother is doing a similar level of activities and trips with Aria then all he has to say to Henry is \u201cyour uncle takes Aria and not you as he is taking her as his child same as how I take you to do xyz\u201d.", "Nta. Does he know what gis dad did? Screwing around and abandoning his affair child? He is old enough to know why the dynamics are the way they are. His feelings are miss directed. \n\nAnd family is more than blood. Aria calls you dad, you are dad. Maybe bro should keep it in his pants.", "Definitely NTA you have looked after her like your own daughter and see most definitely sees you as a father figure. Your not Henry\u2019s dad nor should you cater to his needs your a very kind man for stepping up where your brother refused.", "You are definitely NTA, your brother is the asshole. Henry has his parents that care about him, and now Aria has one too. Your comment to your brother came from pent up frustration with his behaviour, don't listen to the \"YTA\" comments because they're wrong. Everyone saying \"how does Henry feel\" well how would Aria feel with Henry once again getting everything given to him, you all have no idea how much the poor girl would be cherishing her time with her uncle, and Henry going along to their things would probably build more resentment. Let the girl have her time without needing to include Henry", "Many people here do not understand the difference between equality and equity.", "Here is a game changer. How are Henry and Aria with each other?  Any animosity?  And be fair answering.", "NTA. you technically didn\u2019t even have to step up for Aria. I think we can both agree that Henry *probably* knows he\u2019s the favorite and encourages his fathers behavior because it benefits him. Henry is sad he isn\u2019t the favorite in everyone\u2019s life.", "INFO: are you your niece's primary caregiver or do you just take her a lot because you want to?\n\nIf you are her caregiver (or have actually adopted her) and she only goes with her parents sometimes, definitely not TA. If you are raising her in his stead it is not your place to include the child he decides to keep in everything you do, the same way it is not your place to do the same for any niece/nephew as you would your own child as long as you still treat him well and are a good aunt or uncle to him. \n\nIf you and her are just choosing to spend this time together but her parents are still her primary caregivers, you are TA. They are allowing you to take her because it makes her happy and this would mean that you're ignoring her brother in these adventures because you have decided he has it good enough and you don't need to treat them the same.", "NTA. it doesn't seem like you are close to your nephew and from your comments his and Aria's relationship isn't good at all, so you'd both be incredibly uncomfortable the whole time. maybe talk to him and explain that you do those things with her because you see her as your daughter, but not taking him doesn't mean you don't care about him, just that you wouldn't feel comfortable with making her unconfortable, and then tell your AH of a brother that if he wants his kid to have those experiences he should do it himself bc he's not your responsibility.", "ESH except the kids. She isn\u2019t your daughter no matter how much of a father figure you have been to her. Your nephew also doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for his dad\u2019s crappy parenting.\n\nEdit: for people coming late into the post OP added detail once all the ESH and YTA ratings started to come in.", "Esh despite your generosity with aaria, your nephew still sees you as his aunt/uncle.

Bless you for thinking about Aria. I was in her shoes as a kid (my parents divorced when I was a year-old), and my father never cared about me. He only fought for custody of me, so he wouldn't have to pay child support. He and the rest of my family on his side who lived close by ignored me 99% of the time I was there. It was like I was a fly on the wall or invisible. It sucked.", "NTA", "NTA. Maybe Henry needs to be reminded that all of this is his father's fault.", "NTA.

NTA, no one should expect you to treat them equally when they are not equal where family relationships are concerned", "NTA. Henry had two parents who love and treat him well. Aria has two parents who are complete shit to her and her father\u2019s blatant favoritism towards her brother has caused her to hate Henry. OP seeing this stepped up for Aria so she could at least have one adult in her life who actually cares about her well being. Gonna be honest I don\u2019t understand what all the fuss is about OP only taking Aria on trips and doing fun things with her. OP has stated that Aria is basically his daughter and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d adopt her if given the chance. OP still gives Henry gifts (and nice obese it sounds like), but Aria is basically his kid. Why should his kid be uncomfortable so Henry can feel more special?", "NTA, do contact a lawyer and try to get custody of this girl.

Your nephew has his father and mother while your niece barely has a father and doesn't have a good mother. She needs someone to be in her life and look after her and to spoil her.\n\nIm sorry that your nephew feels left out but its not your responsibility to treat them the same when your brother cant even treat his children the same.\n\nKeep doing what your doing with your niece, and hopefully your brother will pull his head out of his ass and man up and be the father his daughter deserves if he has such a issue with you calling her your daughter.", "NTA.

It\u2019s completely fair for you to just be his uncle.

The nephew did nothing wrong and the fact that he is favored by his parents shouldn't cost him a relationship with his uncle and sister. It seems like OP is trying to level the playing field by giving his niece what he feels she is missing out on by taking it from his nephew. And I can understand where that impulse might come from. But instead of leveling things out, the result is that the family will be more fragmented and the kids involved will learn that love is conditional and can be relinquished as a consequence of someone else's actions. \n\nIf I were OP, I would focus on cultivating a relationship with both the niece and nephew, as their uncle. You can have just as close a relationship as their uncle and without excluding one. This will be much more beneficial, especially for the niece, as she has experienced the pain of unjustified rejection and surely wouldn't want to impose that on someone else. You don't need to keep everything 100% fair and square. It's fine to spend a bit more time with your niece and it's even fine if you enjoy spending time with her more. But it isn't doing her any favors to perpetuate the same wrongdoing onto her brother that was done to her. Be an example for both of them of what family looks like. What love looks like.

He in no way highlights any way in with their dad favours Henry he just states that Aria spends her time through the week with him instead of her mom or her dad and that their dad is an every other weekend dad who apparentrly does a good job with Henry but not Aria with absolutely zero examples of favouritism from their Dad to Henry but examples of his favourtism to Aria\n\nI think people should own their descisions and choices and try to mend their relationships if they matter to them.\n\nUncle has decided Aria is his daughter and stepped up for her as a result of her fathers behaviour towards her.

At the end of the day if you cannot actually call him to talk about it with him and explain it to him OP, then thats a sign to me that on some level you are not proud of the decision. Also at this moment in time, OP's BROTHER asked for him to spend more time with Henry and said henry asked for it, until OP actually speaks with Henry who the heck knows he could very well call Henry and find out Henry could not give a rats rear end. He could also find that Henry is not wanting to go to fancy restraunts and have uncle spending money on him but does want to do some cool stuff with him or that actually Henry is asking for this for Uncle to be a bridge to his half sister. Point being Uncle shoudl talk to Henry screw his brother, actually talk to the people that matter and looking at it all. Its not Henry's dad, its Henry and Aria and himself, uncle has said Aria likely would not be interested in going if Henry was there, if Henry's goal is to get close to his sister then its a dead end and OP should let Henry know that, if its purely about \"fancy restraunts\" and not spending time doing fun things with uncle and simply treating uncle as an ATM then uncle should tell Henry how that makes him feel and that its not going to happen.", "Yes, I can see that.

It's not Henry's fault that the adults in his life suck. It's not his fault his sister is treated as less than.

OP doesn't realize that they're doing the exact same thing their brother is doing. And if OP can call his behavior out, everyone on this site can call OP's behavior out. It sucks that Aria's situation is what it is, and I totally get why OP wants to step up for her, but the nephew is noticing the difference between how OP treats them and it's totally fair to call what OP is doing favoritism. And I think ppl would be more on OP's side if they weren't so combative in comments-it makes it feel like all their reasons are driven by spite. \n\nAlso, the excuse OP gave was money, so that's what I addressed.", "[deleted]", "Sure, we don't know the whole story, and op might only know some, but this has golden child and scapegoat written all over it.

To me that sounds like a normal relationship between an uncle and a nephew/ niece. Henry is jealous because aria is getting something he isn't but the thing about relationships is that you don't get to demand a certain type of relationship with someone just because they have that relationship with someone else. The only exception there being the relationship between a child and their parents because parents are morally obligated to treat their children equally. Op leveling the playing field isn't neglecting Henry nor is it anywhere close to them having a crappy relationship close to the level of aria's relationship with her parents. Being neglected by your parents is going to have a much larger psychological effect than having an uncle that's present and active in your life but simply doesn't treat you like their own child.\n\n\nThat's not even considering the possibility that op spending more time with Henry when aria doesn't want to be around him will mean op will have to choose between spending time with her or Henry. Choosing Henry just so he's not jealous is going to make a child that is already unloved and unwanted by their parents feel like the one person that does love and want them is now also choosing the kid that everyone chooses. I mean I guess op can pile on to the feelings of being unloved and unwanted just because a kid (that won't ever know what being unwanted by your parents feels like) feels jealous but in my opinion it'd be an asshole move.", "Henry's old enough to understand why he isn't being treated the same as his neglected sister", "I don't have any financial problems but that doesn't mean I want to spend all my money on someone else's kids.

She took me on special trips for my bday, and I would come visit her in the city for 2 weeks on summer break. Things like that. She would make time to call me and talk on the phone semi-regularly. While my parents still took care of my actual needs, my emotional needs and emotional support was from my aunt. \n\nTo this day, I have an amazing relationship with my aunt.

If Henry has seen her treated this way all these years and his only concern is \"wait, now there's finally one good thing she's getting I'm not!

How dare they not spend just as much money on their brother's favored kid that has parents? \n\nHonest question: How many sibling pairs are you personally funding and fostering, taking to restaurants and on trips? Beacuse since you think you're so much of a better person then OP, I assume you've taken in and are raising more neglected children yourself then OP?

Hanging out doing fun things once a week doesn\u2019t make her his daughter!", "Why do you think that? I'm not asking that as a gotcha, I'm quite serious - what makes you so sure that this is his real motivation?", "Cool story they murdered a trans woman. \n\nDoesn't matter what they do after that.", "No one should be working for 22 cents an hour.", ">Embarrassed-Act3\n\nLet's say you have a daughter and a nephew. Which one are you going to spend more time and money and care on? Probably Curtain #1. LIKE EVERY DECENT PARENT IN HISTORY. OP is NTA.", "Thank you! I don't understand why everyone is accepting this argument. It's actually really weird to claim parenthood over a child just because they like to try new things with you every once in a while.", "For real. The whole \"his daughter\" thing is bizarre as fuck. You can't just claim someone else's child as your own and you certainly shouldn't encourage them to call you that when you don't have a proper parental relationship. Hanging out three days a week is not being a parent.", "You seem to know Henry better than OP, his own uncle, does. Are you Henry?", "If the nephew has noticed the difference in his treatment from his uncle and thinks its wrong then he's capable enough to notice the difference in how his sister is treated by her parents and know thats worse, hes 17, he knows why there's a difference and instead of recognising that he's selfishly complaining to daddy that it's not fair to him, he's not a little kid and he's got 2 parents to spend time with him"]}
