Henry is his wife's child and Aria is his affair partner's child.\n\nWhile he is a good dad to Henry he is a terrible dad to Aria. He is the every other weekend dad who does the bare minimum. Unfortunately Aria has a terrible mom too so she spends most of her time at my home. I love expriencing new things like new food, new activities, going to new cities.... and Aria has started to enjoy these too so a few times a week we like to try something new. She also has an instagram page that she posts everything she does.\n\nA few days ago my brother called me and said that Henry is upset that I never include him and asked if I could take Henry with me as well sometimes. That's when I lost it. I asked him if he seriously expects me to parent his son too while I basically had to adopt his daughter. I told him that frankly I don't care that Henry is feeling left out and I'm not going to include him in activities I do with my daughter.\n\nHe called me an asshole both for excluding Henry and refering to Aria as my daughter\n\nEdit: why is everyone acting like I'm completely ignoring Henry? I spend time with him, I go to some of his important basketball games, I call him whenever I have time and I buy him nice gifts for birthdays and christmas. Last month was his birthday and I bought him an expensive pair of headphones.

Like he sees one of those kids as his own and is the only adult in their life to be there for her while the other child has two loving parents and then one of those parents (who\u2019s also one of the people responsible for hurting the child op loves as his own) is like \u201cbut what about MY kid he is sad you should spoil him without even acknowledging the WHY of op having to step up like this. Like bffr. He didn\u2019t explode on the nephew, he exploded on the shitty dad, and I don\u2019t blame him. NTA op.", "Info - what\u2019s the kids relationship like. As in do they get along or what?", "I have a half brother my father completely abandoned. He's also in a wheelchair and gets 0 child support from my father. If my dads family chose to support him and not me I wouldn't care. I'm not close to anyone on my dads side and am much closer to my moms side. My half brother is also in a way worse spot than me, even though both our moms are single. My dad still makes an effort to see my brother and I, but has completely abandoned my half brother. I would completely understand why my half brother would need more support and love than I do from my dads extended family. \n\nIdk. I just think at 17 he should understand why Aria gets more love from you. She has no one else in her life. He can feel jealous sure, but he shouldn't be asking to go on trips too. \n\nI don't really think youre an asshole tbh. I think you're a great uncle/father figure to her. She doesn't even really have a mom... \n\nAlso, my mom's brothers have never taken me out on trips to new cities lol. They got me gadgets on holidays sure, but taking me on vacations? They're not my dad. I don't know why you have to take him. You do it for Aria because you think shes your daughter. You get him gifts because hes your nephew. Thats a normal uncle nephew relationship.\n\nI do think you do sound a bit annoyed about him in your replies to other people, but you may also just feel defensive.  I also hope her and her half brother can repair their relationship. It sounds like you mostly treat him like a nephew and nothing more. \n\nYou're not treating them equally, no. But its sort of like equity instead because Aria is in a way worse spot. If your brother can't understand that then maybe he should begin to be more equal to Aria...", "NTA\nY'all damn crazy.\nThe niece doesn't have anyone to care for her, hates the brother and has only op to rely on. Now, why he's supposed to ruin the only relationship that this poor girl has in favor of her brother, who has both parents that love and care for him?\nOP you're a great uncle and your niece is super lucky to have you in her life", "You are NTA at all and I don\u2019t understand any of these comments clearly none of these commenters have been the child in this situation and as someone who WAS aria please continue exactly what your doing. Henry gets two great parents while she gets nothing if she gets to see Henry also get you it will tear her apart. Don\u2019t listen to these people and keep being a good parent figure to her since she has no one.", "NTA\n\nNot your monkey not your circus. They're not your kids, you don't owe either of them your time. Aria is lucky to have you. Just don't be a dick to Henry about it.", "NTA you have a good uncle relationship with Henry but stepped up to a dad role for Aria. Nothing wrong with keeping it that way", "NTA ! Now your brother clearly sees how he treats Aria, you specifically give her the attention she doesn't get from her parents that Henry DOES (It seems like everyone is forgetting that Henry is their golden child, but since you're dealing with this weekly this isn't new to you) people screaming that it isn't fair to Henry are forgetting that Aria is missing out on BOTH her parents.", "Nta why? That kid has two loving parents Aria has none and you still do stuff with Henry but not as much as you do with Aria because Aria needed a parent you stepped up provided that. Not your job to make Henry happy if that was the case your brother needs to step up reimburse you for your help with HIS AFFAIR CHILD instead of being a great father to one child and be a crap father to the other. He should have more to do with Aria and make sure she's taken care of so you can spend more time with Henry.  What kind of parent doesn't make sure their kid has a decent place to live? Also regardless is Henry mom still in the picture if so I'm willing to bet that's why she can't Stay with them", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your brother is an idiot. Honestly maybe you should have a talk with Henry. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s fault that both children feel out of place", "NTA\n\nYou are not the person who decided to have the kids. So long as you are kind to Henry when you are in his presence, you owe him nothing more.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt sucks for the son, but guess what?\nYour brother CLEARLY wanted to keep him rather than HIS OWN daughter.\nHe virtually allowed you to adopt, raise, clothe, feed, school costs, basic care needs... But that's not enough, now take my other kid too? Ungrateful!\n\nYou're NOT punishing your nephew. Have your daughter block and private her pages from him and your brother on social media. They won't see the pictures of you raising his (YOUR) daughter, so feelings won't get hurt! Problem solved!\n\nPlus, if your brother brought up you raising his daughter only AFTER you spent a long time with her, who's to say he wouldn't also dump his son on you?  \"But you've bonded soooo much, take my other kid please!\"", "Nta. You love Aria and she loves you, so you spend a great deal of time together. She sees you as a dad and you see her as a daughter. I think its great that she has you. You aren't close to your brother or his son, so you spend less time with him. Makes sense to me. I spend more time with my sisters kids than I do with my brothers. I like my sis and her kids a lot better. Sorry, not sorry. You get to choose who to spend time with. Don't sweat it and enjoy your time with your daughter.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA and I\u2019m confused as to why people are upset with you. I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to spend more time with your niece since you know she doesn\u2019t get as much attention as your nephew. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s your responsibility to explain why you choose to approach the situation like this. At the end of the day your brother should be the one trying to fix all of this.", "NTA. From what I've read you're only compensating your niece since your brother basically doesn't care about her. Agree with your comment that your nephew will survive not being everyone's favorite. Your nephew already monopolizes his parents time attention. Its okay to treat your niece as your child since she needs to be someone's priority as well. If you do the bare minimum like bday and xmas gifts for nephew then its fair", "honestly I\u2019m going against all the comments but I don\u2019t think you are a ahole here\u2026 or it\u2019s a situation to me where it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a ahole or not.\n\nIf you see Aria as you actual child then it\u2019s normal that you love her more then any other niece or nephew.\n\nAnd even though it might be sad for Henry you aren\u2019t obligated to love or spend time with him if you don\u2019t want to same for Aria and you don\u2019t have to but you did and now you need to stay in her life if you consider her your daughter and vice versa it\u2019s a forever commitment so take this seriously.\n\nAnd expect for parents and grandparents (imo) relatives are not obligated to love each other and it\u2019s sad yea especially when the favouritism is shown but in this situation it isn\u2019t who is more important nephew Vs niece.  \nIt more like nephew Vs daughter so if your daughter is first and that\u2019s fine.\n\nPs: sorry if it\u2019s messy English is my third language and have ADHD", "NTA. He wants you to take care of Henry as well. Well, I\u2019ll be darned, I bet you wish he\u2019d take care of Aria but I guess nobody really gets what they want. Why he doesn\u2019t see this is beyond me.", "NTA and lol at the ESH or YTA responses. Good on you for taking care of Aria. I hope the two of you will have a great lifelong relationship. Your brother can go pound sand.\n\nEdit: furthermore, it\u2019s not like OP is actively excluding the nephew. The niece who has been effectively abandoned by her father is spending time with her aunt. He never said anything bad to Henry\u2019s face, just told his brother off for being insensitive to Aria\u2019s needs and advocating for his favorite child.", "Do you 2 consider each other father daughter? If you both do then that makes you he parent. Ink and blood doesn't make a family. \n\n\nShe is your daughter in all the ways that matter and of course your daughter who lives with you is going to be treated differently than a nephew.", "You \u201cinclude\u201d Aria because she has no one else.  You\u2019ve basically adopted her.  Your brother, who\u2019s Aria\u2019s father, excludes her twelve of every 14 days.\n\nIf Aria is living with you and you are acting as her parent, then Henry has no real reason to be jealous.  NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like he does plenty with Henry.", "As a middle child who had an older brother who was my mom's favorite, and a little sister who was my dad's favorite.  Thank you for existing and being you're awesome self. If it wasn't for my aunt stepping in to do what you're doing life would have been way shittier for me", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here. Family relationships like this are very complicated. I have cousins my parents basically adopted and we all know who actually parented them. You taking on Henry would just alleviate your brother of more of his responsibility.", "NTA. Sounds like Henry is living his best life with both his parents and Aria only gets to see her Dad every other weekend and it\u2019s not the best time and the 12 days she has with her mom suck too. And OP does stuff for Henry just not as much as OP does for Aria because Arias actual parents aren\u2019t doing for her like Henry\u2019s parents are for him. The only AH here is Henry and Aria\u2019s father", "I mean. Ideally each kid would have full parenting. But as far as who is doing the parenting, Aria has you and Henry has his dad. Your brother SHOULD be parenting both of them, but aria is lucky to have you step up and be a parent for her. Objectively, Aria is your daughter, and Henry is your nephew, regardless of what blood says. I say NTA", "NTA - For Aria, she\u2019s spending time with the only person who treats her as their child, a parent figure. For Henry, he just wants to go on paid vacation. I would be more sympathetic if he wants to spend time with you, not just go fun trips.", "NTA you are doing what is right for you and for Aria. Henry has his parents. If he wants those experiences then he can ask his Daddy and Mommy.", "NTA. I don't know what's wrong with the comments but seriously guys. Henry has two loving parents. Aria has none. Uncle stepped up and that's bothered you??\n\nFather asked to include his favourite in those trips OP refused no matter what the situation NO is NO. \n\nAs simple as it is OP has the right to choose where and to whom he is spending his time and money on.\n\nHenry gets the attention of two adults but it is upsetting when Aria gets to have one. ???\n\nHenry is entitled as the picture shows. It's either he gets all or well 2 and Aria gets nothing.\n\nOP for this headache to be over just tell Henry and your bother at some point  \"That's I'm sorry. But I can't include you in these trips because one I don't have the budget for that and two I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing if your father had done his role as a good father for Aria.\"\n\nRegarding OP calling Aria his daughter. Well if he feels that connection none here has the right to judge that. He is parenting her while 2 of her living parents aren't. Y'all need to be thankful.", "NTA.  Maybe look into actually adopting Aria, though.", "NTA. You are Aria's dad, not Henry's. Clearly your brother doesn't include Aria in everything (or anything), so why would you include Henry?", "So, NTA, but I feel compelled to point out two things- it\u2019s not Henry\u2019s fault his dad is useless, and maybe he\u2019d like to get to know his sister better. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to include him once or twice a month. You\u2019re still his uncle, and you\u2019re caring for his sister. When does he see her? \n\nNo, it\u2019s not your responsibility to parent these kids, but you could bring a little light and happiness to their lives by including him once in a while.", "Info how has Henry treated Aria in the past? you talk about your brother being a shit father to Aria which clearly makes him an AH and you have talked about Henry being spoiled in some comments and you have also said Aria hate Henry.\n\nIs this just because Henry gets the picture perfect family with a mother and father that seemingly spoil him or was he actively bad to her in the past and treated her badly because she is the affair child?\n\nThis really determines it for me because if Henry just been kinda spoiled but neutral to Aria then its probably ESH but if he has been actively horrible to Aria then its NTA.", "NTA nice that she has you in her life.", "I mean, your brother is overall a giant AH for how he treats his kids, but I think you need to reframe this request.  \n\nYour brother was not calling to ask you to do something *for him*.  He was asking you to do something for *Henry*.  And as big of an AH as your brother is, Henry isn't an AH.  He's a kid who didn't ask to be a part of this mess.  Henry is a kid who sees you doing things with his sister that you don't do with him.  Henry is a kid who loves you too and wants special time with you too.  Henry is a kid who is feeling left out by his own family.  Your brother deserves what he gets, but did *Henry* deserve this?  Does Henry deserve to be pushed aside by a relative just because his dad sucks?\n\nNo, he doesn't.  And you're an AH for not caring about the fact that a child, your nephew, is hurt by your behavior.  Put all those high horses you rode in on back in the stable.  You only have the high road when it comes to your brother.  NOT when it comes to the innocent children who are not at fault for this situation.  \n\nESH except for the kids", "NTA and I've actually been in a similar-ish situation. My sister lived with my aunt during my mom and dad''s divorce for a few years. They are naturally much closer than me and my aunt are. And that's normal. Not \"favoritism\". Everyone saying he's choosing his niece over his nephew blah blah blah blah is not looking at the actual situation. OP is raising Aria. She calls him her dad. He thinks of her as his daughter. It's not niece vs nephew it's daughter vs nephew. Of COURSE he spends more time with the girl he considers his daughter. It would be way weirder if it was the other way around. But you guys are hung up on the technicalities. Who cares if he isn't her biodad and hasn't legally adopted her. He's taking care of her, he loves her. Why do the legal/bio definitions of their relationship matter to you guys more than the ones they BOTH use???", "Nta nephew has a stable life all aria has is op", "ESH.  Aria is lucky to have someone who is there for her.  But, you are exactly your brother.  You feel so much for Aria that you treat Henry the same way your brother treats Ara.  Have you ever heard that two wrongs don't make a right?  You COULD be the person that ensures these two siblings grow up with a good relationship.  Eventually, they will be strangers now, thanks to both you and your brother being gigantic assholes.", "ESH.  Brother sucks for being a terrible parent.  You suck because children that are your relatives want to spend time with you and you rejected one of them.  Take the opportunity to improve your relationship with your nephew who apparently wants to have a relationship with you.\n\nFocus your anger on your brother who deserves it.", "NTA. You're totally right, it isn't your responsibility to parent his son too. What he's asking is unfair, and you don't owe him this when he doesn't even bother with Aria on a regular basis. His expectations are ridiculous and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about standing up for yourself.", "NTA - you say ni\u00e8ce even refers to you as her father, so you are her father figure in her life and essentially her only present parental figure. If we then imagine this as two brothers who have their own children, then this is an insane request. My cousins go on many vacations with their families and include none of the cousins, similarly I go on trips with my father and we invite none of my cousins. Unless your brother is doing a similar level of activities and trips with Aria then all he has to say to Henry is \u201cyour uncle takes Aria and not you as he is taking her as his child same as how I take you to do xyz\u201d.", "Nta. Does he know what gis dad did? Screwing around and abandoning his affair child? He is old enough to know why the dynamics are the way they are. His feelings are miss directed. \n\nAnd family is more than blood. Aria calls you dad, you are dad. Maybe bro should keep it in his pants.", "Definitely NTA you have looked after her like your own daughter and see most definitely sees you as a father figure. Your not Henry\u2019s dad nor should you cater to his needs your a very kind man for stepping up where your brother refused.", "You are definitely NTA, your brother is the asshole. Henry has his parents that care about him, and now Aria has one too. Your comment to your brother came from pent up frustration with his behaviour, don't listen to the \"YTA\" comments because they're wrong. Everyone saying \"how does Henry feel\" well how would Aria feel with Henry once again getting everything given to him, you all have no idea how much the poor girl would be cherishing her time with her uncle, and Henry going along to their things would probably build more resentment. Let the girl have her time without needing to include Henry", "Many people here do not understand the difference between equality and equity.", "Here is a game changer. How are Henry and Aria with each other?  Any animosity?  And be fair answering.", "NTA. you technically didn\u2019t even have to step up for Aria. I think we can both agree that Henry *probably* knows he\u2019s the favorite and encourages his fathers behavior because it benefits him. Henry is sad he isn\u2019t the favorite in everyone\u2019s life.", "INFO: are you your niece's primary caregiver or do you just take her a lot because you want to?\n\nIf you are her caregiver (or have actually adopted her) and she only goes with her parents sometimes, definitely not TA. If you are raising her in his stead it is not your place to include the child he decides to keep in everything you do, the same way it is not your place to do the same for any niece/nephew as you would your own child as long as you still treat him well and are a good aunt or uncle to him. \n\nIf you and her are just choosing to spend this time together but her parents are still her primary caregivers, you are TA. They are allowing you to take her because it makes her happy and this would mean that you're ignoring her brother in these adventures because you have decided he has it good enough and you don't need to treat them the same.", "NTA. it doesn't seem like you are close to your nephew and from your comments his and Aria's relationship isn't good at all, so you'd both be incredibly uncomfortable the whole time. maybe talk to him and explain that you do those things with her because you see her as your daughter, but not taking him doesn't mean you don't care about him, just that you wouldn't feel comfortable with making her unconfortable, and then tell your AH of a brother that if he wants his kid to have those experiences he should do it himself bc he's not your responsibility.", "ESH except the kids. She isn\u2019t your daughter no matter how much of a father figure you have been to her. Your nephew also doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for his dad\u2019s crappy parenting.", "Esh despite your generosity with aaria, your nephew still sees you as his aunt/uncle.

It's unfortunate Henry feels that way but it's really not your problem.", "NTA but this part\n\n>Henry is his wife's child\n\nThis makes it sound like Henry married his own mom lol", "NTA. Bless you for thinking about Aria. I was in her shoes as a kid (my parents divorced when I was a year-old), and my father never cared about me. He only fought for custody of me, so he wouldn't have to pay child support. He and the rest of my family on his side who lived close by ignored me 99% of the time I was there. It was like I was a fly on the wall or invisible. It sucked.", "NTA", "NTA. Maybe Henry needs to be reminded that all of this is his father's fault.", "NTA. You actually sound nice...But you just can't refer to your niece as your daugther. Is not okay", "Aria is your kid, Henry is your nephew. NTA, no one should expect you to treat them equally when they are not equal where family relationships are concerned", "NTA. Henry had two parents who love and treat him well. Aria has two parents who are complete shit to her and her father\u2019s blatant favoritism towards her brother has caused her to hate Henry. OP seeing this stepped up for Aria so she could at least have one adult in her life who actually cares about her well being. Gonna be honest I don\u2019t understand what all the fuss is about OP only taking Aria on trips and doing fun things with her. OP has stated that Aria is basically his daughter and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d adopt her if given the chance. OP still gives Henry gifts (and nice obese it sounds like), but Aria is basically his kid. Why should his kid be uncomfortable so Henry can feel more special?", "NTA, do contact a lawyer and try to get custody of this girl.  After this it will be living hell with your brother and most of all being around Henry.", "Nta", "NTA as a woman who is one of the oldest grandchildren and nieces in my family I wish I had an uncle like you when I was growing up(i have and amazing mother but my father left and no of my uncles ever stepped up to be a male role model for me not one, and i had a lot) and I think your doing a great thing for your niece. Your nephew has his father and mother while your niece barely has a father and doesn't have a good mother. She needs someone to be in her life and look after her and to spoil her.\n\nIm sorry that your nephew feels left out but its not your responsibility to treat them the same when your brother cant even treat his children the same.\n\nKeep doing what your doing with your niece, and hopefully your brother will pull his head out of his ass and man up and be the father his daughter deserves if he has such a issue with you calling her your daughter.", "NTA.

It\u2019s completely fair for you to just be his uncle. Aria deserves to have at least one parental figure in her life and people saying you either need to step back from her or basically adopt him too so it\u2019s even are ridiculous imo.", "NTA, if you wanted nothing to do with Aria the comments would be saying you\u2019re NTA.", "Henry is realizing he's missing out after seeing his half sister, who his father has neglected, getting to experience actual love from a parental figure.

This is something you folks don't seem to be getting. One of them he considers his own child, the other he does not. You generally treat your own kids differently to other children.", "Agreed here. YTA.", "Because those activities are expensive so at least on a financial level it feels like I'm gonna have another child", "No he just wants to go to the fancy restaurants and nice trips. I will call him every night and talk to him if that's what he wanted but let's nit pretend like he wants to spend time with me", "Family is made just as much as it is born from blood.\n\nJust for the record.  \n\nNTA.", "This is ridiculous. They are not the same, One is a parent who had a child, blamed her for existing, and neglected her in favour of his other child.\n\nThe other took in a child no one wanted, made her feel loved and like she finally has something of her own, and now is getting hate for not treating the children the same.\n\n\nMy grandfather fought in World war 2. He killed Nazis. Does that make him as bad as the Nazis? After all, they both killed people, and context isn't relevant.\n\n\nWhat a take honestly. All her life she's been second fiddle, not even receiving the crumbs of affection her brother doesn't want, but the second someone does something just for HER, she has to share with him. \n\nFunny how 'treating them equally' ends up just giving the brother what he wants, and who cares if she doesn't want that, right? \n\nAnd to address how 'blatantly favouring' the sister will destroy the brother, how is it you gloss over that she's been living like that her whole ass life? \nHow is she not destroyed? And if you think she is, why does she have to let people that contributed to that keep doing it? When is the last time something the brother got to do was also offered to her? Her bro does stuff with his family all the time, and she's not invited. But because her stuff is now expensive and he wants it, fuck her feelings, right? \n\nBe better, understand context, and let him protect the girl For.fucks.sake", "Why wouldn\u2019t they? They don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s all the reason needed.", "So you would rather for her have nothing at all? My uncle was like that did that would bring me on holidays and trips same for my step grandfather they were both great and if I didn\u2019t have them in my life I wouldn\u2019t have had no one and I would rather have whatever weird dynamic you assume then only have parents who do nothing for me and barley like me in my life. And it\u2019s his niece can people not make everything weird? That kid has someone she consider a dad and vice versa that\u2019s it. If you find it weird then that\u2019s a you issue.", "You need to learn that. He loves her, he loves Henry, IN DIFFERENT WAYS. \n\nHe's a good UNCLE to Henry, and a good FATHER to her, but Henry has never had to deal with her getting something he didn't before, so he feels left out.", "Okay and the same is true for Henry. If OP is showing up in the ways for him he has described, then Henry can accept that OP shows love for Aria in a different way.", "I disagree. The niece is abused. She should be allowed to have one person in her corner.", "Ok but that\u2019s not for us to decide and op doesn\u2019t have to spend time with his Nephew if he doesn\u2019t want to from the edit he clearly does what he \u201cshould\u201d as a uncle but to Aria he is a dad and she is his daughter and it\u2019s not that simple I\u2019m sure Aria is aware op loved her brother as his nephew but they are not the same for op one is his kid and the other is is nephew ofc one will be more of a priority.", "OP seems to hold something against Henry. In the comments, they assume Henry only wants to be included to exploit the benefits, not because Henry actually wants to spend time with OP.", "Even if he does understand the reason he's being left out, the whole dynamic is still pretty sad. The nephew did nothing wrong and the fact that he is favored by his parents shouldn't cost him a relationship with his uncle and sister. It seems like OP is trying to level the playing field by giving his niece what he feels she is missing out on by taking it from his nephew. And I can understand where that impulse might come from. But instead of leveling things out, the result is that the family will be more fragmented and the kids involved will learn that love is conditional and can be relinquished as a consequence of someone else's actions. \n\nIf I were OP, I would focus on cultivating a relationship with both the niece and nephew, as their uncle. You can have just as close a relationship as their uncle and without excluding one. This will be much more beneficial, especially for the niece, as she has experienced the pain of unjustified rejection and surely wouldn't want to impose that on someone else. You don't need to keep everything 100% fair and square. It's fine to spend a bit more time with your niece and it's even fine if you enjoy spending time with her more. But it isn't doing her any favors to perpetuate the same wrongdoing onto her brother that was done to her. Be an example for both of them of what family looks like. What love looks like. What stability looks like. And let them come learn where the true fault lies, which is not in each other.", "She lives with him, and spend the majority of time with him, they have a parental bond, he is her dad simple as that. Having the legal custody is irrelevant.  \n\n\nAllot of \"parents\" who have custody dont deserve to be parents. For most of human history there was no paperwork, if you take in a kid and raise them they are your kid, that's it. Who do you think she is going to ask to walk down the aisle? to come back and visit when she is at college? To call grand pa? \n\n\nYour family is the people you love, I hope you understand that some day.", "But we don\u2019t know that he\u2019s giving his son what he needs. He may be providing the basic necessities, but that doesn\u2019t make you a good parent. He could be a totally neglectful asshole to his son at home. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility, of course, but I do think he should have a talk with his nephew to see how he feels about the situation, instead of relying on what his brother said.", "Exactly. OP\u2019s brother is a shitty parent to one of his children. Therefore, he\u2019s a shitty person. We can logically conclude that he\u2019s not that great to his son either. Being present and providing financially don\u2019t make a good parent.", "Yes I think the crap father SHOULD call his daughter and address his relationship with her and fix it. Aria CHOSES to spend time at her uncles instead of her fathers through the week because her mom is shit, at no point does OP say that her Dad in anyway form or manner actualy does treat Aria different from Henry other than that he has Custody of her every other weekend and does bare minamum. He in no way highlights any way in with their dad favours Henry he just states that Aria spends her time through the week with him instead of her mom or her dad and that their dad is an every other weekend dad who apparentrly does a good job with Henry but not Aria with absolutely zero examples of favouritism from their Dad to Henry but examples of his favourtism to Aria\n\nI think people should own their descisions and choices and try to mend their relationships if they matter to them.\n\nUncle has decided Aria is his daughter and stepped up for her as a result of her fathers behaviour towards her. Kudos to uncle, uncle has also decided that despite nephew wanting to spend more time with him and do fun things with him he is not interested in spending more time with Henry and doing more fun things with him. Screw Henry he has his dad, and two wrongs make a rite.\n\nAre you genuinly against the idea of the uncle speaking to his nephew who he supposadly cares about when the nephew has said he feels excluded by said uncle and wants to spend more time with the uncle.\n\nAre you genuinly against a crappy father calling their daughter and trying to make amends to repair their relationship.\n\nWhy is it a bad idea for people to call each other and talk about their feelings and relationship\n\nEDIT\n\nTo be clear as blunt and angry sounding as my call Henry comment was, it is something that OP should think about, actually talking to Henry about this situation. At the end of the day if you cannot actually call him to talk about it with him and explain it to him OP, then thats a sign to me that on some level you are not proud of the decision. Also at this moment in time, OP's BROTHER asked for him to spend more time with Henry and said henry asked for it, until OP actually speaks with Henry who the heck knows he could very well call Henry and find out Henry could not give a rats rear end. He could also find that Henry is not wanting to go to fancy restraunts and have uncle spending money on him but does want to do some cool stuff with him or that actually Henry is asking for this for Uncle to be a bridge to his half sister. Point being Uncle shoudl talk to Henry screw his brother, actually talk to the people that matter and looking at it all. Its not Henry's dad, its Henry and Aria and himself, uncle has said Aria likely would not be interested in going if Henry was there, if Henry's goal is to get close to his sister then its a dead end and OP should let Henry know that, if its purely about \"fancy restraunts\" and not spending time doing fun things with uncle and simply treating uncle as an ATM then uncle should tell Henry how that makes him feel and that its not going to happen.", "Yes, I can see that.  If Henry being there will drive Aria away, I can see OP not wanting to do that. But I still think that he could plan something just for him and Henry.  You are right that he is not obligated, but it would be nice.", "Then leave.", "OP can do that, but they are still purposefully treating their nephew differently. It's not Henry's fault that the adults in his life suck. It's not his fault his sister is treated as less than. He sees OP and would like to be closer to them as well. \n\nOP excluding Henry is their prerogative, but it's still showing favoritism. It would be different if Henry didn't give a flip about OP.", "Now you're just talking in circles, either the money is an issue or it isn't, it's your choice. \n\nIf the money is an issue, tell your brother that he has to pay for tickets and meals for his son. \n\nIf money isn't an issue, then you can't keep whining the occasional extra ticket feels like having another child. \n\nEither way you're an uncle being an asshole to your nephew right now", "[removed]", "So then tell your brother you\u2019ll include Henry if he picks up the tab.", "It seems he sees Aria\u2019s social media and want to be included.  It\u2019s jealousy of the material things you provide Aria, as portrayed in social media.\n\nNot your problem OP.", "You have such animosity for a kid who did nothing more than get born to his parents - it\u2019s an ugly look, to be honest. Why do you assume the worst of Henry like that?", "Did he tell you this, O great and wise AH?", "How do you KNOW that\u2019s what Henry wants? He I do you even know how he\u2019s treated at home when nobody is around? You\u2019re taking your resentment toward your brother out on your nephew. Maybe you should actually have a serious conversation with the boy, and see how he really feels, and go ahead and explain to him that you spend more time with his sister because her parents suck. He\u2019s old enough to hear that.", "Why would he want to spend time with you when you don't seem to want to spend time with him?  YTA", "And what do you do on those nice trips and fancy dinner with Aria? Do you not spend time with her? You know quality time a phone call doesn't replicate.\n\nYou'd save yourself a lot of money for Aria's future if you two spent quality time at home too and not at fancy restaurants and trips.", "So glad there are others who can read between the lines on this one. Reading these comments you'd think it was some lost little boy looking for his uncles love rather than a 17 year old who's always been favoured, getting jealous because finally someone is putting his sister first, he's old enough to see that she's been neglected in his favour and yet is still trying to take the one thing she does have away too", "Well, that's why everyone's calling them an asshole. OP doesn't realize that they're doing the exact same thing their brother is doing. And if OP can call his behavior out, everyone on this site can call OP's behavior out. It sucks that Aria's situation is what it is, and I totally get why OP wants to step up for her, but the nephew is noticing the difference between how OP treats them and it's totally fair to call what OP is doing favoritism. And I think ppl would be more on OP's side if they weren't so combative in comments-it makes it feel like all their reasons are driven by spite. \n\nAlso, the excuse OP gave was money, so that's what I addressed.", "[deleted]", "Sure, we don't know the whole story, and op might only know some, but this has golden child and scapegoat written all over it. Dad cares about his sons feelings being hurt. He's trying to make sure he has even more now, what he spoils his son with, and now trying to get op to do it too.", "I don't think spending time with someone, going to their important events, calling them during your free time, as well as giving them expensive gifts is considered a crappy relationship. To me that sounds like a normal relationship between an uncle and a nephew/ niece. Henry is jealous because aria is getting something he isn't but the thing about relationships is that you don't get to demand a certain type of relationship with someone just because they have that relationship with someone else. The only exception there being the relationship between a child and their parents because parents are morally obligated to treat their children equally. Op leveling the playing field isn't neglecting Henry nor is it anywhere close to them having a crappy relationship close to the level of aria's relationship with her parents. Being neglected by your parents is going to have a much larger psychological effect than having an uncle that's present and active in your life but simply doesn't treat you like their own child.\n\n\nThat's not even considering the possibility that op spending more time with Henry when aria doesn't want to be around him will mean op will have to choose between spending time with her or Henry. Choosing Henry just so he's not jealous is going to make a child that is already unloved and unwanted by their parents feel like the one person that does love and want them is now also choosing the kid that everyone chooses. I mean I guess op can pile on to the feelings of being unloved and unwanted just because a kid (that won't ever know what being unwanted by your parents feels like) feels jealous but in my opinion it'd be an asshole move.", "Henry's old enough to understand why he isn't being treated the same as his neglected sister", "I don't have any financial problems but that doesn't mean I want to spend all my money on someone else's kids. Is that hard to understand?\n\nMy brother won't pay just like he is not paying for Aria", "Even if moneys isn\u2019t the issue he shouldn\u2019t have to pay for someone else\u2019s kid? (Niece is a daughter to him so i don\u2019t really view her as his \u201cniece\u201d but more as a adopted/foster daughter)", "If my brother paid equal attention to both kids I wouldn't include either of them", "He said Aria hates Henri and wouldn't go if Henri was invited. And she needs more, Henri has 2 loving parents. OP is NTA.", "Or how about Henry gets attention from his uncle when arias father treats her like he does Henry. \nI can\u2019t believe how many of you are fine with a father abandoning their kid, but an uncle is an AH for just not taking him too.", "To play devils advocate, a lot of kids and even older teens will say this to your face. I've seen it firsthand.", "Did you even read the post?", "If the nephew can notice the difference between how uncle treats him and his half sister then he should be able to see the difference in how his own father treats him vs his half sister and should call his dad out for favoritism but he won't because that in his favor.", "As one of the people commenting out of spite: you are correct in saying that it is fair to recognize this as favoritism, but my point is that it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s favoritism or not. She doesn\u2019t want to spend effort (be it in money or time figuring out a more equitable solution) to include both children. That alone is justification for not doing so.", "Op isn\u2019t doing the same thing because he\u2019s not his father??", "That's what you're focusing on? \n\n\nEven if by your interpretation she doesn't sleep in his home, she is still spending her waking time with him which s what matters"]}
