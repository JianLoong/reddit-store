It certainly helps but it\u2019s not cool.", "People keep saying this and have clearly no idea how houses in the UK are built. Overheating is a huge issue in new builds in the UK - google it. My flat is hot in winter and extremely hot in summer. I don't have to use heating in winter because it's hot enough without it. In summer it's often over 30 degrees (86 to americans) in my flat.", "Lol it\u2019s easier to handle heat when you don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to AC. It\u2019s way harder to handle 100+ when you are used to a 68f office all day", "you must be american? completely normal where i live", "He is in Europe, it's normal here", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s typical behaviour", "Hmmm I am not sure what that is!\n\nHere we actually kiss hello and goodbye. If there is too many people we just blow a kiss from like the door before we leave. It can be a pain in the ass hahah", "Baked and un-crispy.", "That's likely an issue with too little or failed cavity insulation, not too much. If you have windows on either side the ideal scenario is to have them both open a bit, but shaded from sun, to allow for cross ventilation. The best thing is to shade the windows externally, which is what you see in historically hotter, mediterranean countries. If your windows are at ground level the foil backed radiator insulation is good for this, if you only have internal access you can add this to the window side of your blinds (foil out).", "That is not an issue with \u201ctoo much insulation\u201d it is a solar gain issue, but sure - I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about I just have multiple degrees in building design and architecture.", "English, in north Hampshire", "Where do you live?\n\nBritains also got some weirdness with full nudity.", "No it isn't. I live in Germany but 'normal' it's not. Some do it but it's not normal", "Midwesterners just...cannot leave. There are tons of funny YouTube videos about it! :)", "Me? austria", "I don't know where you live, but I lived in Rostock and Bremen and most of the children under 6 are naked on the beaches.", "Ooh I will look for that \n\nThings here do last a looooong time, I guess haha. Maybe the humidity just makes us sluggish", "Ah yeah, then yeah, Britain's very different from a lot of mainland Europe culturally. We're way more uptight about shit like that for... reasons? You'd figure we would've chilled out when we got rid of the extreme puritans to American and switched from Catholicism, but who knows.", "There were also kids till about 10 according to op. Yes maybe until 4-5y o are naked but older?! No"]}
