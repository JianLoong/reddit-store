As a result, she has moved out of their house and is currently bouncing around from family member to family member.  She's been doing this for about 6 months.  She's stayed with us for about 2 months of that time, spread out over 3 visits.  This has caused some stress on our marriage as I don't do well with extra people in my living space.  But my wife feels bad for her mom because she was fully dependent on step-dad and doesn't have a job or a place of her own anymore.  \n\nFor Xmas this year, we were going to spend Xmas Eve with my wife's family at my wife's aunt's house and then come home and spend Xmas Day at our house as a family.  But now my MIL has asked my wife if she can come home with us after Xmas Eve and spend some more time with us over the holidays.  \n\nI told my wife that spending Xmas Day at home as a family, alone, was her idea and we agreed on it together.  But she said she doesn't want her mom to be alone on Xmas.  I told her that her mom was planning on staying at the aunt's place, but is only now wanting to come home with us.  It started to turn into an argument about MIL needing to get her life figured out, and my wife told me to stop fighting about that because that part isn't important and she just wants her mom to feel like she's still part of a family during Xmas.  \n\nSo, I eventually relented and said that MIL can come with us for Xmas, but I have conditions.  I said that MIL can come home with us if she agrees to watch our 2 kids for New Year's weekend so that my wife and I can go do something fun with some friends, or alone, if we want to.  Get a hotel or AirBnB, who knows.  \n\nMy wife said that her mom is not a free babysitter and that we can't expect her to just watch our kids for us whenever we want.  I told her that if MIL isn't a babysitter, then we aren't a hotel and if she's going to keep going from house to house being dependent on people, she's going to have to pull her weight if it's going to be our house she's staying in. \n\nMy wife said she won't ask her mom to babysit our kids for free for an entire weekend so I said in that case, she and MIL can stay home with the kids and I will find something fun I want to do for New Year's weekend by myself.\n\nMy wife said I am being selfish and that MIL is going through a hard time in her life and she needs family support.  She said I am being a jerk by making that support conditional on MIL doing things for us instead of just doing it because we want what's best for her.  She said that if I leave to do something on my own for New Years, then I will have to be the one to explain to our kids why I am not there to bring in the new year with them. \n\nI told her that I have no problem talking to our kids about that, but I won't tell them the whole truth that their mom is putting MIL ahead of our family and relationship.

MIL needs to get it together and make her own way.  It\u2019s entirely reasonable to ask her to stay w your kids so you can go away when she\u2019s literally spent 2 months living with you for free.  Your wife needs to cut the apron strings w her mom", "NTA! There has to be compromise here. Yes, it's awful that MIL is going thru a hard time, however, she also needs to figure out what she is going to do to stabilize her life. Couch hopping isn't a good thing. Either you all are going to take her in to bring in stability and the condition to allow her to live with you all would be to help with the kids. That's not an unreasonable request or expectation. You're not asking her to be the sole & primary caregiver, just to help out where the kids are concerned. You seem to be the only one compromising as well & that's not okay either. As for the New Year's thing, saying you'll do it alone while they stay home will never work in your favor. But your wife has to respect  your thoughts as well and come to a MUTUAL decision that works for all, not just her & her mother. Try to imagine if this were your Mother to get some understanding, but your wife also has to understand that this dynamic is affecting the whole household & it's not unreasonable to ask for some boundaries and compromise. Sheesh.", "NTA \n\nSix months is a long time for a middle aged woman to couch surf without responsibilities or getting her self together.\n\nThere's a difference between supporting someone and enabling them not to move forward.\n\nYour MIL should definitely have responsibilities, wherever she stays. She cannot expect to be a forever guest. Or a guest until her divorce is final.\n\nYou said that she is completely dependent on her estranged spouse. That leads me to believe that she doesn't have a job. ( After six months, she really should have one, unless she has a physical or mental condition that prevents her from working)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think that your request is reasonable. I think your wife is wrong for shutting it down. \n\nAsking your wife's mother to watch your children for a few days, so that you and your wife can have some time away is something that isn't objectionable at all.", "I think that asking her to watch the kids in exchange for a place to stay is pretty fair.

Would you really be happy for your MIL to stay of the two of you could get awy for 2 days?  You will still probably be miserable.  I think you threw that out there, knowing wife would not agree to it.\n\nSo why not consider other options that allow MIL to be with family on the holidays, but maybe not stay with you full time.

But I would not go away by yourself on nye if you want to stay together. However, the idea of your MIL also doing something in the house when she stays over for a longer period of time sounds reasonable to me.
