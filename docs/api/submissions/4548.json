As a result, she has moved out of their house and is currently bouncing around from family member to family member.  She's been doing this for about 6 months.  She's stayed with us for about 2 months of that time, spread out over 3 visits.  This has caused some stress on our marriage as I don't do well with extra people in my living space.  But my wife feels bad for her mom because she was fully dependent on step-dad and doesn't have a job or a place of her own anymore.  \n\nFor Xmas this year, we were going to spend Xmas Eve with my wife's family at my wife's aunt's house and then come home and spend Xmas Day at our house as a family.  But now my MIL has asked my wife if she can come home with us after Xmas Eve and spend some more time with us over the holidays.  \n\nI told my wife that spending Xmas Day at home as a family, alone, was her idea and we agreed on it together.  But she said she doesn't want her mom to be alone on Xmas.  I told her that her mom was planning on staying at the aunt's place, but is only now wanting to come home with us.  It started to turn into an argument about MIL needing to get her life figured out, and my wife told me to stop fighting about that because that part isn't important and she just wants her mom to feel like she's still part of a family during Xmas.  \n\nSo, I eventually relented and said that MIL can come with us for Xmas, but I have conditions.  I said that MIL can come home with us if she agrees to watch our 2 kids for New Year's weekend so that my wife and I can go do something fun with some friends, or alone, if we want to.  Get a hotel or AirBnB, who knows.  \n\nMy wife said that her mom is not a free babysitter and that we can't expect her to just watch our kids for us whenever we want.  I told her that if MIL isn't a babysitter, then we aren't a hotel and if she's going to keep going from house to house being dependent on people, she's going to have to pull her weight if it's going to be our house she's staying in. \n\nMy wife said she won't ask her mom to babysit our kids for free for an entire weekend so I said in that case, she and MIL can stay home with the kids and I will find something fun I want to do for New Year's weekend by myself.\n\nMy wife said I am being selfish and that MIL is going through a hard time in her life and she needs family support.  She said I am being a jerk by making that support conditional on MIL doing things for us instead of just doing it because we want what's best for her.  She said that if I leave to do something on my own for New Years, then I will have to be the one to explain to our kids why I am not there to bring in the new year with them. \n\nI told her that I have no problem talking to our kids about that, but I won't tell them the whole truth that their mom is putting MIL ahead of our family and relationship.

Yes, it's awful that MIL is going thru a hard time, however, she also needs to figure out what she is going to do to stabilize her life. Couch hopping isn't a good thing. Either you all are going to take her in to bring in stability and the condition to allow her to live with you all would be to help with the kids. That's not an unreasonable request or expectation. You're not asking her to be the sole & primary caregiver, just to help out where the kids are concerned. You seem to be the only one compromising as well & that's not okay either. As for the New Year's thing, saying you'll do it alone while they stay home will never work in your favor. But your wife has to respect  your thoughts as well and come to a MUTUAL decision that works for all, not just her & her mother. Try to imagine if this were your Mother to get some understanding, but your wife also has to understand that this dynamic is affecting the whole household & it's not unreasonable to ask for some boundaries and compromise.

That leads me to believe that she doesn't have a job. ( After six months, she really should have one, unless she has a physical or mental condition that prevents her from working)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think that your request is reasonable.
