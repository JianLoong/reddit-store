{"id": 29107, "submission_id": "17a0r09", "title": "AITA for getting our neighborhood dog Olympics canceled instead of bending the rules for a neighbor?", "selftext": "I understand that this is a silly issue to have, but it's an issue we have an I need advice. \n\n5-6 years ago my HOA decided our neighborhood is boring and encouraged people to come up with ideas/activities to liven things up. This, my Pup Olympics was born. \n\nIt's just the neighborhood dogs competing (poorly), in different silly events for 2 days and being rewarded with treats. Early on there would be prizes for the owners of whichever dog won each event, and it really was all fun and games. After a couple years we started doing a paid entry for each event, and the money went toward cash prizes and a donation to a really great local animal shelter (where lots of us got our pups!). Might be worth it to note that most people in the neighborhood choose to donate their cash prize toward the shelter fund, so we usually come up with a pretty great donation. People look forward to the Olympics every year, it's ridiculous but it's fun and we all loved it. \n\n18 months ago a new neighbor moved in and she has a Poodle who frequently competes in (and wins) dog competitions. This dog has a million followers on Instagram. We all follow the page and obvious root for this dog in the competitions. No issue with the dog itself. \n\nHowever, it ruined pup Olympics last year. This dog swept every single competition. There is literally one event for senior dogs that it didn't qualify for and that's the only one that this Poodle didn't win. We all just kind of stood there for two days and gave cash prizes to the same woman for every event. To make matters worse, she also didn't donate a single extra penny to the shelter fund (bonus AITA for if I'm wrong for being judgey here). This has taken a event for families and kinds and turned it into something it was never meant to be. It's like having a professional athlete compete at a high school field day. \n\nSo, Pup Olympics are happening soon, but this year my committee decided on \"No Competition Dogs\" rule, to make it more fair for the other owners/families. \n\nThe Poodle owner got notice of this and has gone ballistic. Our HOA had a committee meeting and decided in her favor, that we couldn't exclude her or her dog if we wanted to have the competition in the neighborhood. I thought about it and then just went ahead and sent a cancelation notice out. Somebody from the HOA board tried to pull it back together but just isn't getting much interest. \n\nNow the Poodle owner has sent me multiple vindictive messages implying that I did this to hurt her personally and the neighborhood is split 50/50 on who was in the wrong. So, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;Dr: Changed the rules of our neighbor pup Olympics to exclude a professional show dog, which put the neighborhood in shambles.\n\nEdit for moe info: \n\nI didn't have space in the post, but to clarify, deciding to cancel was more of a long story short after 4 days of meetings with this woman to try to come up with something agreeable. \n\nFirst, I offered to do a couple of categories for more serious competition dogs, but was told by the HOA that I'm not allowed to host any kind of events that make it seem like any part of this is a 'real' dog competition. \n\nThen I tried to restrict how many events each dog can enter, and she wanted that number to be 8. Out of 10 events, she wanted 8. That was the number she got the HOA board to agree with her on, and they basically told me that if I couldn't let that happen, then I couldn't host the competition.", "created_utc": 1697555898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a0r09/aita_for_getting_our_neighborhood_dog_olympics/", "score": 5779, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems you tried some adjustments and direct cooperation with the poodle owner, and she pretty much dug her heels in at the standard of completely redefining the scope and spirit of the event, which is mindboggling. Obviously NTA. In light of that detail, OP, I'm surprised you're even questioning it. You tried to make it work and she refused to accept any compromise or adjustment that restored the event to what it was intended to be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~So, realizing the woman sounds like a beast, I do feel this is E S H because a lot of things could have and should have been done differently. Let me make this clear - if you're the primary organizer and no longer wish to hold / facilitate the event because of pretty much any reason, you're not obligated to hold the event. BUT there were some missteps that created the circumstances for disaster...~~\n\n~~I think events like this that have an unwritten expectation that winnings get donated back towards the cause are kinda shitty. They leave the winners feeling there is no REAL choice because of the unstated rule that winnings become donations...and if there is no real choice, why feign it? If the goal is to maximize charitable earnings, entry fees should go straight to charity and you should have OTHER prizes that aren't expected to be donated back to the cause (treats, dog toys/supplies, GCs to a local groomer or supply store, etc.). If that had been the way this event was organized, her unfortunate choice of keeping several events' worth of winnings would have been non-existent. It also seems like it might have been possible to set up silly competition categories the poodle could not win (cutest underbite, longest legs, or a general talent comp), or set a max on the number of events any one  competitor could be in. Lastly, someone could have talked to her directly about the background and intent of this event, that it's not in any way a serious competition, and that it's more about community building than showcasing any one dog, and that it feels unfair and out of sync with the spirit of the event to bring in essentially a trained professional.

She might have a competitive dog and thus be a competitive person which is crappy for a neighborhood event, but you also made a rule knowing it would only exclude one single dog in the entire neighborhood which is kinda crappy too. Why not instead limit it to one win per dog? So if her dog wins an event, the dog isn't eligible for future wins. You don't exclude your neighbor and her dog, just because she competes, and she and her dog can't be fun suckers for the event by winning every event.", "NTA for changing the rules, but YTA for cancelling rather than finding a different host. \n\nThere\u2019s other ways of handling the issue without cancelling: talking to the poodle owner, handicapping pros, having her host an exhibition if she didn\u2019t compete, adding non-athlete categories - stupidest trick, best costume, closest owner lookalike, best kiss, most likely to eat you, etc. \n\nIt sounds like a super fun event.

While the poodle sweeping the competition wasn\u2019t fair, I\u2019m sure your neighbor wanted to be included and have a sense of community. Creating a rule to exclude a single neighbor was the most ostracizing way to approach this situation and you are the asshole for handling it that way. Your post says that this is a multi-day affair. I\u2019m confused as to why you couldn\u2019t create/replace competitions with things that would create more specificity. For example, create a category just for small dogs or a silly game that would be unfamiliar to competition and pet dogs. There are a thousand approaches you could\u2019ve taken to solve this problem that wouldn\u2019t have been an unnecessary dig at the neighbor.\n\nYour neighbor sucks here too. They may have been surprised by their dog sweeping the competition and they may have struggled to react appropriately in that social situation, especially since it sound like they typically compete seriously. That said, going ballistic and sending you harassing messages isn\u2019t justified and that makes them the asshole too.\n\nYou all sound petty and unpleasant.

It's terribly sad that the day started just to get people together and it's all canned because of one.  She won't have known the history,  but it'll have been obvious it was a very localised event.  I can only imagine the personality of someone that is comfortable to win every competition and fail to notice the fun has gone for others.  Since she was pissed at the change it's reasonable to believe she intended the same for this year.   \n\nSo I understand why you'd throw in the towel.  But the fact the neighbourhood is divided suggests to me not everyone sees this the way you or I do.  While I'm sad at the injustice it seems others either didn't care or thought it didn't matter.  So now you've unilaterally cancelled based entirely on your own judgement.

This, my Pup Olympics was born. \n\nIt's just the neighborhood dogs competing (poorly), in different silly events for 2 days and being rewarded with treats. Early on there would be prizes for the owners of whichever dog won each event, and it really was all fun and games. After a couple years we started doing a paid entry for each event, and the money went toward cash prizes and a donation to a really great local animal shelter (where lots of us got our pups!). Might be worth it to note that most people in the neighborhood choose to donate their cash prize toward the shelter fund, so we usually come up with a pretty great donation. People look forward to the Olympics every year, it's ridiculous but it's fun and we all loved it. \n\n18 months ago a new neighbor moved in and she has a Poodle who frequently competes in (and wins) dog competitions. This dog has a million followers on Instagram. We all follow the page and obvious root for this dog in the competitions. No issue with the dog itself. \n\nHowever, it ruined pup Olympics last year. This dog swept every single competition. There is literally one event for senior dogs that it didn't qualify for and that's the only one that this Poodle didn't win. We all just kind of stood there for two days and gave cash prizes to the same woman for every event. To make matters worse, she also didn't donate a single extra penny to the shelter fund (bonus AITA for if I'm wrong for being judgey here). This has taken a event for families and kinds and turned it into something it was never meant to be. It's like having a professional athlete compete at a high school field day. \n\nSo, Pup Olympics are happening soon, but this year my committee decided on \"No Competition Dogs\" rule, to make it more fair for the other owners/families. \n\nThe Poodle owner got notice of this and has gone ballistic. Our HOA had a committee meeting and decided in her favor, that we couldn't exclude her or her dog if we wanted to have the competition in the neighborhood. I thought about it and then just went ahead and sent a cancelation notice out. Somebody from the HOA board tried to pull it back together but just isn't getting much interest. \n\nNow the Poodle owner has sent me multiple vindictive messages implying that I did this to hurt her personally and the neighborhood is split 50/50 on who was in the wrong. So, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;Dr: Changed the rules of our neighbor pup Olympics to exclude a professional show dog, which put the neighborhood in shambles.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And there are many reasons one would participate in them main reason for most is showing your dog is a big part of ethical breeding, it's putting your dog in front of a third party judge who dose not have your bias about the dog, and hopefully out of all the other dogs your competing against whether they be the same breed or group you get chosen. Winning these tiltes/gaining points is a big part in determining whether or not the dogs is good enough to be passing on its genes. \n\nPut it this way a dog can pass health test but if it fails in the conformation show ring that usually means there is something wrong with the dog like the structure is off which is the main thing checked by the judges in the ring, it's why they touch and handle the dogs the way do. A dog with poor structure won't walk the way the breed is suppose to, won't stand correctly, their bite might not come together correctly all things that add up to the overall health and breed specific performance of the dog. It could also spell out a poor temperament think of how stressful such an environment can be a dog of less than sound mind and temperament will fall apart in the ring regardless of what training it has, and that's something it can pass down to a litter. Fearful and aggressive dogs make for fearful and aggressive puppies.\n\nOther reason love of whatever breed there showing, AKC event and others like it are a place for breed/dog enthusiasts who like to see and have dogs do what they do best from show to barn hunts. Or even just demonstrate the abilities of their dog while having fun dock diving, flyball,  bite sports, and lure coursing.", "It's fairly rare for there to be cash prizes, although it does happen, usually in the special puppy and veterans sweepstakes.  More often you get silver or crystal trophies in conformation at big trials, just a ribbon at smaller ones. \n\nIn obedience or rally, it's usually a ribbon and a little dog toy, but at big trials or specialties you sometimes will get say \"$100 for the top scoring dog with a junior handler given by HappyDogOwner\" or \"$100 for the oldest qualifying dog - given in memory of Fluffy McFlufferkins\". We once  won highest scoring poodle in a large rally trial.   I think it was a  $25 gift card to Petco and a poodle stuffy.\n\nFor the sports I compete in, you do it to have fun with your dog.  Spend time with them, train them, meet up with friends, etc.  Conformation, in theory, is to show other breeders your dogs and have them judged to the standard to support and improve the breed. \n\n I mean, I wouldn't take my dogs to this neighborhood meetup and compete in an obstacle course, because my dogs have freaking agility titles. I'd be helping in the ring!  And getting them to do tricks....because that's fun stuff!   There are plenty of people in the dog world who are OBSESSED with winning, and literally cannot understand the concept of a nice day out with your dog.

At the end of the day everyone can give some money to donate to the shelter.", "Poodle patty \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m the owner of a bougie AF standard poodle and had to laugh. And NTA. The poodle owner is being a total dick", "Or frankly make all the prizes go towards the shelter. That way she can compete and \"win\" but she's not taking home the prize money which i think truly is the crux of the issue", "This is a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  She gets her dog into serious competitions to win significant money, and I'm guessing that represents a significant investment in time and money, especially if she isn't training the dog herself.  She sees a neighborhood competition with cash prizes and she thinks \"hey, easy money\" because to her, it isn't just a fun little game, it's part of her bottom line.\n\nThis reminds a bit of professional (or at least serious) poker players.  Sure, the bulk of your time is spent at casinos playing mid to high stakes against much stiffer competition, but the gravy train is when you can get an invite to soft home games where everyone is there to drink and socialize, and maybe throw a bit of money around, and a lot of people really don't know what they're doing.  While drink and socialize also, your primary goal is to win money \u00f1o\n  Neighbor has an inside track on a home game, and while it may be lower stakes than what her dog is used to competing in, for her it's basically free money.", "It's always a safe bet that anyone on an HOA *board* is totally guaranteed to be one.", "Oh thank you so much! This is pure gold!", "Boom! Solved.", "Oof, I would not want to be a judge for that event!", "Oh god. I thought they were polishing their own dog to give them a nicer coat, like the dog version of a last minute root spray. That\u2019s so depressing. :(", "Probably $200.", "> Instead give out metals\n\nYeah, a nice shiny hunk of tin or maybe some cast iron, yeah, that'd be great.", "But that would still make the games boring to watch if her dog is still going to win every sport. It would just be two days of everyone praising the same pair of dog and owner.", "If this lady has a big following on Instagram I wanna bet she twists it into sounding like SHE is the one donating. She seems like the type.", "If she couldn't make cash off this she probably wouldn't compete.", "Yeah, this one would clearly be a fun competition", "Newfie has entered the chat.\n\nSecond runner up my tiny ass Keeshond.", "Right, I have a newfie and a pit. No comparison my newf destroys \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I change my mind. This is probably the best solution. I suspect she only cares about the participating because it's essentially free money. If money isn't included in the prize she might lose interest all together.", "Obstacle course with a mud pit\n\nhot dog eating contest (no chance she feeds a show poodle a hot dog once in a while)\n\nfastest hole digger (my Aussie will dig a hole big enough for the owner in maybe a hour)", "Hello \ud83d\udc4b", "I agree. I wouldn't be ignoring the dog before, but I would be acknowledging the real winner after the event.", "I also want to know who it is because I have agility poodles too!", "Give poodle lady's dog first prize.", "I have two saints getting in their winter coats. I'd have a damn good chance there.", "As a former housing discrimination attorney, you have me cackling.", "I love this! I was so proud when my boy learned to beg quietly. \ud83d\ude02 He just sits, stares, and drools while we eat. He gets a little panicky as you near the last bite, but remains quiet. Yeah\u2026. I tell him he\u2019s a good boy but he\u2019s really not. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If I were a neighbor I'd be happy to let the poodle have that win.", "Heyoooo", "The poodle wouldn't win. She would.", "I want hercInstagram so I can shame her.", "It's not always like that. In this instance, they could probably make her pay legal fees.", "See Ganking"]}
