I\u2019m the gentle parent who helps identity emotions, comforts him, and am also a SAHM.\n\nMy husband is the harsh one; he gets impatient, has anxiety and raises his voice but has never hit my son as far as I know. If my son cries or has a hard time he will yell \u201cstop crying!\u201d with no effort to help him work through the feelings. He also tends to ignore my son most of the time and is always on his phone.\n\nMy son has a meltdown every day when my husband comes home from work. He listens for footsteps when he is in the house and freaks out when he\u2019s coming or tries to hide. He tells me he doesn\u2019t like daddy and he wishes daddy would live in a different house. He\u2019s always in flight or fight mode when dad is home.\n\nHe does like other people and enjoys playing with his teacher at school, and some of my cousins and friends so he\u2019s not typically afraid of other adults.\n\nThe last time my husband was home for 2 weeks on PTO a few months ago, my son had a breakdown every day after about the 8th day.\n\nI told my husband in the future 2 weeks of him home is too much for our son. I said to try 1 week instead or suggested he take a trip with friends or solo so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nWell he decided to \u201cwork from home\u201d for a week and take another week for PTO. \n\nI suggested again to my husband that he take a trip on his own for a few days. He refused and said why don\u2019t YOU go?? So I did!\n\nI decided after 5 days of my son having anxiety attacks that he needed a break. I booked a local trip for 2 nights (Monday -Wednesday) so my son could have a short vacation with me and relax. I already saw SO much improvement and happiness in the first few hours. And he had no tantrums the whole time.\n\nMeanwhile my husband was home angry texting me how I\u2019m breaking up the family and that I need to tell my son that vacations are NOT fun without dad and that I should not have gone without him. He was saying how I\u2019m the reason his son hates him because I probably tell him bad things (I don\u2019t). And that because I\u2019m a SAHM and very close with my son, that is the reason he is always saying he doesn\u2019t like his dad.\n\nMy husband says every time my son says he doesn\u2019t like daddy, I should respond with \u201cdaddy loves you and that is not ok to say.\u201d \n\nInstead, I tell him it\u2019s ok to share his feelings and that he can always tell me the truth. I have been also asking him to share the reasons and validate him that it\u2019s ok to have body boundaries (one of the things is that dad will pick him up or try to touch without his consent). I am trying to set him up for telling me now and in the future if anyone ever violates his boundaries and that mama will always listen to him and validate his feelings.", "created_utc": 1684514541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m0tq0/aita_for_taking_my_3_year_old_son_on_vacation/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is way beyond a reddit concern.", "NTA for the vacay but...\n\nClearly something is going on here between your son and his dad. It is not normal for a child to listen for their parents footsteps and hide. It is not normal for a child to be so anxious after X days of their parent being around they have fits and anxiety. It's not normal for a child to have NOTICEABLY BETTER BEHAVIOR immediately after leaving for a vacay without their parent. Girlfriend, what is going ON? Clearly your son does not feel safe with your husband, and you need to find out why.", "NTA for this issue but like. Your kid is actively expressing how traumatized he is by your husband and lives in neverending fear, and that's the real issue. This is going to deeply scar him and you're allowing it to continue. If you don't get him help and get him out of this living situation then you're supporting the abuse continuing and contributing to hurting him. \n\nSincerely, if you want to protect your son you need to get your husband to change permanently so he is able to express remorse and be a better parent, or you need to get your son out of a living situation with your husband. Your son can't advocate for himself, he needs you to do it for him.", "YTA for keeping your son in such an abusive situation, unfortunately. NTA for taking him away from it for a little while.", "I don't think you're wrong for the trip. But I'm curious: does your son act like this on weekends when hubby is home too? Cuz sometimes, even often, kids have a \"witching hour\" when they are just cranky and unregulated and it often coincides with working parents getting home/picking up kids. So that could ve exacerbating the issue. But it also sounds like your husband is ... not a positive presence in ypur son's life.", "Thank you for sharing this, OP really needs this info and you sound like a reliable source! I have a question: I know in cases of spousal abuse, the advice is generally not to agree to marital counseling because the abuser may turn it into another venue to abuse the victim. Does that not apply for child abuse cases if both parents attend family counseling?\n\nEdit: typo.", "My uncle was never abusive but my aunt used to do this with her son. He would cry nonstop and demand time alone with his mom. He is 22 now, no friends, no future, my aunt cant go anywhere without him and he is basically in love with her. \n\nThe kid can feel not protected around his father and it should be investigated by a therapist, but i dont think she is dealing with this well, but more like creating more distance between them", "If a kid reacts like that to his father, any reasonable court will not do that.", "Don't take legal advice from your opposition. Contact a DV shelter near you for case management like the YWCA", "Take a video of your husbands mistreatment and then a restraining order and divorce", "Document everything, go to a lawyer, and contact domestic abuse resources for your area in secret. Yes there is a risk that he will get custody but it's not guaranteed, and can be renegotiated. \n\nThe fact that he's threatening you with it means that he is well aware that his presence is damaging your young son.", "What about a couple's therapist?  Or giving your husband the ultimatum of individual counseling to work on his relationship with his son or divorce?", "relying on a court to be reasonable is dicey", "Uh... look, generally speaking, short of outright physical abuse with documentation, dad is going to get some time with the kid and mom won't get to be there if they get divorced. In most states, you'd need a team of doctors, therapists, and teachers to show by a preponderance of the evidence that seeing dad isn't in the child's best interests to completely restrict his time with the kid. The standard for seeing a parent *not* being in a child's best interests is high\u2014like team of experts and expensive litigation high\u2014without proof of physical abuse. A guardian ad litem would, at best, recommend temporarily supervised visitation. As long as dad isn't using \"unreasonable\" discipline, verbally abusing a toddler until he's scared of you isn't abuse (though I agree it should be). Lots of abused spouses and spouses of child abusers don't leave for this reason.", "This is just not true, and something you shouldn\u2019t lie about and give people false hope. Especially if he has money.", "That's a disturbing take but probably not out of order", "\"has never hit my son as far as I know\"\n\nThat is a troubling statement. NTA but methinks a longer vacation from Daddy might be better.", "Clearly something has happened for your son to react that way. Is he really the dad? Because it\u2019s always my son, never our son. Maybe he has some kind of resentment towards the kid. Regardless, this isn\u2019t working. NTA", "You choose to stay with a man who frightens your child so intensely that he cries when he hears his father\u2019s footsteps? He is *abusing* your son. And likely you too, since you talk about all of this so nonchalantly and don\u2019t see the giant, glaring red flags for what they are. \n\nHoney, I\u2019m not gonna make a judgment on who the AH is, because I think you already know it isn\u2019t you. Take off the blinders and save yourself and your child. Just because he hasn\u2019t hit him, doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t. Just because he isn\u2019t hitting your son (you don\u2019t mention whether he hits you) doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t abusing him. Please find a way to get to a safe place and get away from your husband. He is nothing but bad news and you and your son deserve to be happy at home, not living in fear.", "\u201cI should respond with daddy loves you and that\u2019s not ok to say\u201d\n\nFuck right off mate (to the husband)\n\nFor a kid to have that reaction to his own father at 3 years old is not ok.\n\nWhat I mean by this is your husband is the problem.\n\nWake up. This is not normal.", "YTA! Why are you with someone who is abusing and traumatising your son? My heart broke reading how he has a meltdown EVERY SINGLE DAY his dad gets home. My parent also was extremely angry but not even to this extent and do you know how many mental health issues I have now because of it? I was terrified of every thing, I self harmed, I developed OCD using obsessive rituals to \u2018save myself\u2019 and to protect myself from getting in trouble (which I got in pretty much from breathing sometimes). I\u2019m now in my mid twenties and only after intensive therapy and strong medications have I begun to heal and make any progress. Your son has a similar future if you don\u2019t get him out of this situation.\n\nI can\u2019t believe your son is being abused to the point he has a breakdown every day and you\u2019re bothered about a holiday?? Have you ever heard the saying \u2018if your parents are together and you have one abusive parent, then you have two abusive parents\u2019.\n\nEdit: I saw in comments you are worried about him taking full custody if you divorce. You need to gather evidence, can you secretly record him via audio on your phone or have a baby cam somewhere? I really hope you manage to get out. Good luck.", "Yes he was around all the time for the first 2 years bc we were stuck together during Covid. He didn\u2019t start expressing himself more until he turned 3 and could verbalize things. He\u2019s ok when I leave him with other people for a few hours.", "Yeah, unfortunately he\u2019s like this on weekends, and on days when my husband works from home and is there all day :(", "It's a little tricky and I'd defer to a divorce attorney with experience with domestic violence but generally, if you can find a therapist with experience dealing with possible abuse, it can be very helpful to have their clinical records available when you go into the custody process. That said, even if you don't have that paper trail, your attorney can hire a parent evaluator as part of the process (paid out of the family bank account) and they'll usually catch behavior as egregious as this.", "Not a lawyer, but the advice focused on getting a professional witness to the husband's actions and the son's reactions. The goal of family therapy wouldn't be to reconcile and live together (or really to listen to what the husband has to say); instead, the goal is for the husband or son to reveal what specifically has the son so terrified to an adult outside of the family unit.", "when her three year old son is having panic attacks when his father is home and she doesn\u2019t see an issue with this we can call her AH", "I don\u2019t know why you got downvoted. You\u2019re telling the truth. My husband had to allow unsupervised visitation with his criminal drug addict ex. It\u2019s too scary.", "Family courts are biased towards men."]}
