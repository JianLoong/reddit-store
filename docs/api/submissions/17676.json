I\u2019m the gentle parent who helps identity emotions, comforts him, and am also a SAHM.\n\nMy husband is the harsh one; he gets impatient, has anxiety and raises his voice but has never hit my son as far as I know. If my son cries or has a hard time he will yell \u201cstop crying!\u201d with no effort to help him work through the feelings. He also tends to ignore my son most of the time and is always on his phone.\n\nMy son has a meltdown every day when my husband comes home from work. He listens for footsteps when he is in the house and freaks out when he\u2019s coming or tries to hide. He tells me he doesn\u2019t like daddy and he wishes daddy would live in a different house. He\u2019s always in flight or fight mode when dad is home.\n\nHe does like other people and enjoys playing with his teacher at school, and some of my cousins and friends so he\u2019s not typically afraid of other adults.\n\nThe last time my husband was home for 2 weeks on PTO a few months ago, my son had a breakdown every day after about the 8th day.\n\nI told my husband in the future 2 weeks of him home is too much for our son. I said to try 1 week instead or suggested he take a trip with friends or solo so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nWell he decided to \u201cwork from home\u201d for a week and take another week for PTO. \n\nI suggested again to my husband that he take a trip on his own for a few days. He refused and said why don\u2019t YOU go?? So I did!\n\nI decided after 5 days of my son having anxiety attacks that he needed a break. I booked a local trip for 2 nights (Monday -Wednesday) so my son could have a short vacation with me and relax. I already saw SO much improvement and happiness in the first few hours. And he had no tantrums the whole time.\n\nMeanwhile my husband was home angry texting me how I\u2019m breaking up the family and that I need to tell my son that vacations are NOT fun without dad and that I should not have gone without him. He was saying how I\u2019m the reason his son hates him because I probably tell him bad things (I don\u2019t). And that because I\u2019m a SAHM and very close with my son, that is the reason he is always saying he doesn\u2019t like his dad.\n\nMy husband says every time my son says he doesn\u2019t like daddy, I should respond with \u201cdaddy loves you and that is not ok to say.\u201d \n\nInstead, I tell him it\u2019s ok to share his feelings and that he can always tell me the truth. I have been also asking him to share the reasons and validate him that it\u2019s ok to have body boundaries (one of the things is that dad will pick him up or try to touch without his consent). I am trying to set him up for telling me now and in the future if anyone ever violates his boundaries and that mama will always listen to him and validate his feelings.", "created_utc": 1684514541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m0tq0/aita_for_taking_my_3_year_old_son_on_vacation/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
