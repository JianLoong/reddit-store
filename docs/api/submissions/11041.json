That night my daughters (16f) boyfriend (17m) drove to our house to visit her. As he was about to leave he noticed his car door was frozen shut and he couldn\u2019t get in it. I was willing to pay for him to get an uber home, but the app kept saying there were no drivers available. He asked if he could stay the night and try to defrost his car door in the morning. That obviously wasn\u2019t happening, he\u2019s not allowed to stay the night under any other circumstances so why would this time be any different. So he just walked back home, and honestly it was only a 15 minute walk. My daughter was and is still currently upset with me for making him walk home \u201cin that weather\u201d. She says I was being inconsiderate and anything could\u2019ve happened to him. To be fair it was only 15 minutes and he made it out just fine.

If there were no Ubers available it's likely because the conditions were that crappy. Temperatures and windchills were in the negatives and you had him out there walking in it.

You let a kid walk 15 minutes in bad weather, potentially icy conditions, likely no sidewalk access, at a time when roads may be narrower than usual because of the snow banks. You really can\u2019t accommodate a guest stranded at your home for 1 night? If your kid wants to sneak around they can do it in the daylight. Sex doesn\u2019t follow vampire rules around the sun.

That obviously wasn\u2019t happening, he\u2019s not allowed to stay the night under any other circumstances so why would this time be any different. So he just walked back home, and honestly it was only a 15 minute walk. My daughter was and is still currently upset with me for making him walk home \u201cin that weather\u201d.
