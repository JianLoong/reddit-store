She had her son at 15 and because she was in high school Bill and Iended up raising him until he was 7. We also paid for Amity's college. My reasoning is that we have already given her childcare for seven years and college, so she already received the payout from us even though I was alive and well at the time. \n\nThough it seems Bill already told Amity we'd help her out and she was getting half the inheritance, so I had to correct her and tell her I'm not giving her or her brother any money. \nThis has been blowing up the family. Amity was furious because she says she's in a bad financial place and she can't believe I'm not helping her even though I could. Bill understands where I'm coming from but says Amity is living in a trailer and I could at least help her out.

You can do whatever you want with your money, but it's very cold that your daughter needs financial help and you won't help her because you \"already did.\" Even worse that you're holding her having a kid as a 15 year old against her. She was just a kid.", "YTA - I'm voting this way because I think you really resent your daughter for getting pregnant at 15.  She made a mistake.  She didn't rob a bank.", "INFO: Why aren't you helping her brother either?", "Why are you cutting your kids out? Did they do something wrong?", "It might be unpopular but YTA \n\nYou have the opportunity to ensure your daughter, son and grandkids have a financially secure future in a climate where things are hard and getting harder.\n\nYou\u2019re keeping a scorecard of previous parenting are patting yourself on the back and consider your parenting done.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s your money and your decision, I just think it\u2019s the wrong one.", "INFO: is Bill their father? Is there more to the story between you and your daughter? It sounds like basically she disappointed you by having a baby so young and you\u2019re still punishing her for it. Please correct me if this isn\u2019t the case.", "YTA. When a kid has a kid at 15, it's not the kid's fault, or at least not mostly. It's a parenting fail to not provide birth control (preferably long-term), guidance, and some coaching on how to handle pressure in a relationship. At the VERY least, it was YOUR choice to keep and raise the kid rather than abort, adopt, place with family, place with the FATHER'S family, etc.  So you screwed her over when she was a teen, but at least you did pay for college and stepped up to raise him. And why are you not, at the very least, putting it in trust funds for the grandkids? Even if you don't care about what happens to Amity, what about your grandbabies? Are they supposed to pay for her not making you happy?", "I mean you can do whatever you want with your money but that doesn't mean people in your life, mainly your family, won't think you're TA.

YTA, and big time.\n\nAt the beginning I wondered if your daughter is well off and that's why you want to give away your money. But she lives in a trailer park. A trailer park! Do you know what that kind of money can do to help someone in such a bad situation? You're essentially choosing to help random people over your own kids _who are in need_.\n\nSorry but YTA.", "YTA you're going to be charitable to others and not your kids? That's cold.", "YTA. I understand you don't want to leave anything to your daughter, though I think you are callous, but what did your son do to be ignored in the will? I get it. You want to punish your daughter, but your son apparently has done nothing to warrant that.\n\nBut I think it's ironic you want to donate to charity, BUT you are okay with your daughter living in a trailer park. Sounds to me you just don't like your children.", "YTA. I get it\u2019s your money and whatever, but I can\u2019t imagine bypassing my own children when I have a mass of wealth I\u2019ll be losing after I\u2019m dead.\n\nAlso you resent your underaged child for getting pregnant. That was your failing as a parent. She was a kid.", "YTA, not because you\u2019re leaving the money to charity, but because you\u2019re doing so not because you have love for charity/humanity, but because you want to punish your daughter for getting pregnant as a teenager. You are deciding that your last act in life is to hurt your family. That will be your legacy, the way you are remembered. Not as a person who cared so much she left everything to charity, but as a woman who had so little love in her that she purposefully didn\u2019t do anything to help her own family when she could have.", "You can do whatever you want with your money. But it's wrong to hold such resentment toward your child because she was got pregnant at a young age and you helped her raise your grandchild. And it's wrong to hold you paying for her college against her. A parent-child relationship is not transactional. Furthermore, why wouldn't you want her to have that money so she can move out of her trailer? I'm not trying to be on a high horse here, but this just seems wrong.", "Soft YTA. 1. With inflation, how do you know Bill won\u2019t need the money if he lives a long time? 2. What about your son? He didn\u2019t get any help and now gets nothing? 3. Why don\u2019t you want to help your daughter and grandchildren not live in a trailer? Even buying them a home could make a small dent and they would be set. You could even put it in a trust if you didn\u2019t want amity to control it.", "It's your money, but I'm going to say that YTA for your reasoning. Having a pregnancy *at 15* is at least as much an indictment on the parents as the child, and treating that and her college like a purely financial transaction (which is nowhere near $1M) seems extremely assholish to me; you're effectively punishing her for the fact y'all failed her as parents when she was a teen and for totally normal, if nice, support during college.\n\nE: Regarding the edit:\n\n> Edit to clarify: Bill is going to leave everything to the children/grandchildren when he passes. Caleb hasn't done anything, but they will both be getting money regardless.\n\nThis doesn't really make things better. For one thing, it makes the your entire argument about why your daughter doesn't \"deserve\" her inheritance moot; you lied to us and you lied to her about the reasoning, because it's just \"I don't wanna!\"\n\nAnd, like, sure, if you don't want to give them money you don't have to, but the fact is that if your finances are so segregated that you can give out $2,000,000 to charity on your own, you can't use your husband as a shield for randomly cutting your kids off for no reason. They're your kids too, it's still an AH move to cut them off arbitrarily and it's certainly an AH move to invent justifications for it you don't actually care about.", "YTA - even after your edit. You should be putting a portion into a trust.  One for the grandkids one for the daughter and son. With a trust you can still have stipulations such as money is only to be spent on xyz.... prior to your edit, all you were doing is making the grandkids suffer and potentially stunt their growth as good human beings by making it needlessly harder on your daughter because of your resenting judment of when or how capable she was when she had children.", "info: how did your daughter get pregnant at 14/15 and have a baby at 15?Did she not have good sex education? Did she not have access to abortion? Why or why not?", "First of all I'd say that I'm sorry for what you're going through. \n\nSecond, it seems like there is something more here you're not telling us about your daughter. Is there animosity? Do you think she's not responsible? Your post implies it. Simply refusing to include your daughter in the will because you already paid for her college and childcare is kinda trivial in my opinion. Especially when you know she is in a bad financial situation. What about your son? \n\nat the end of the day it's your choice but if I was someone in a bad financial place and find out my dying mother wasn't leaving me anything I would feel a type of way as well. \n\nAgain, if she's irresponsible then it makes sense. I just wonder what about you son makes you deny him too?", "INFO. Why don\u2019t you want to leave anything to your son either? It\u2019s an AH move, at least in my eyes to not want to leave anything at all to your children when they need it (or at least one does as evident). Are you fine with your daughter living in a trailer with your grandchildren? Why wouldn\u2019t you want to help when you can? Did they do something to warrant leaving them out of the will?\n\nEdit: I originally said they weren\u2019t an AH by technicality since it\u2019s their money but I take that back since their reasoning is also AH-ish and an AH is still an AH.", "I mean, it is your money but wow, YTA.\n\nLet me get this straight... You'd rather donate your money to complete strangers than help your own flesh and blood (who sound like they are struggling) to succeed in life? Because of why exactly? A teenage pregnancy?\n\nHarsh.\n\nYou can justify however you want, it's your money afterall. Your children are losing their mother, and that's the memory you want them to have? It sounds like you hold a huge grudge, and are on a mission to ensure your own children don't show up at your funeral.\n\nI'd reconsider your choice if you want to preserve whatever is left of your relationship with your children before you die. They're your legacy. If you want to live on, it'll be through them.\n\nIf you have 1 charity, 2 children, and 3 grandchildren, divide your money in 6, spread the wealth equally at the very least, leaving the grands funds in trust until they're 25 or something.", "YTA - Missing, missing reasons", "Ok, big question though - What charity?", "Have you considered leaving the money in a trust for your grandkids? I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, but YTA. Who is to say someone from one of those charities hasn\u2019t received some big generosity, but you\u2019re willing to help them?

Did whatever charity tell you they can't name the building after you unless it's the whole $2 mil?", "If she has kids and one that is already close to college bound, why not save set money aside to give the grandkids a good start at life? That way Bill isn't stuck with with total responsibility when you pass. He seems to want to take care of things. It is your money so you can do whatever you want but if you care about Bill, I would figure something out so that he has peace of mind too.", "I would put it in a trust so they can't blow the money, but can almost get a monthly allowance per say.

Five years ago, my son (whom I love to the ends of the earth and back), at the request of his wife, took our two precious and only grandchildren and walked out of our lives. Abandoned us.  No address. No phone calls, no texts.  No birthdays. No Christmases.  No messages to his 93 and 94 year old grandparents.  Long, deep, ugly, painful silence. From the kid we loved, sheltered, and supported with every drop of our beings for 28 years.\n\nDo you know how many people told us to cut them out of our will?  I lost count. But I refuse. This kid is heart of my heart.  Love of my life.  He always will be.  And I refuse to take the low road and treat him - or his family - badly. In the end, love is love is love.

You state you already gave a lot to your daughter, why aren't you leaving anything to your son? You seem to have a lot of resentment to your daughter. Did raising her kids prevent you from having the life you imagined or is it something else.

That's nice, but it seems like they need the money sooner then in thebyears to follow. why not leave the money to your husband to save for the kids or to setup a trust so they can get a little extra income monthly or something for your grandkids.

Youre as much at fault for her mistakes as a child as she is! I don't think she should be punished for struggling as a mum when she was a literal child herself! I also generally don't believe most charities actually do much for those in need so it's like you would rather burn your money than see your kids be comfortable and I'll just never understand parents like that. I was homeless for half my childhood and I would sell my insides if it meant my son will never experience that. It just seems really, cold, to leave your children nothing knowing they need help. And to resent your own child for needing help? That's just whack.", "YTA.  It is your money and of course you can decide where it goes.  However, your actions seem designed to cause pain, to in effect say that you don\u2019t care about your children and grandkids.  This makes you the AH here.  Dying people don\u2019t come to this decision though without some provocation, so this post is really missing the backstory that would mitigate an AH judgement.", "YTA - I could understand not leaving everything to them and setting up a trust with some conditions but to leave both children and grandchildren absolutely nothing seems petty.

Do you realise most charities are just rich peoples fax free bank accounts and dont actually help? \n\nAnyway your daughter is literally in a bad financial place and you're leaving her with nothing? Not even 50k? 5k? Absolutely nothing at all?\n\nDonate most of your money if you have too but give your kids something. They do not have the same privilege you had growing up.

They wasted ALL of their money on brand new toys and luxuries and whatever else. It was their money they could do what they wanted. But now my parents, my siblings, cousins and me are below the poverty line. I will never own a house, or be able to have children.

I think we can leave room for some nuance but here it is.\n\n1. Your husband is an asshole for promising your daughter money when you explicitly said she wouldn't be getting any. Even if his heart was in the right place or maybe hes morally correct in some way that she doesn't deserve a punishment you seem intent on doling out, all he did was cause an enormous amount of grief and strife when you are going to die in a year. I don't think any good has come from trying to handle the situation by manipulating you, Which is what hes attempting by telling your daughter you were going to give her money when he knew damn well you didn't want to.\n\n2. You daughter is an asshole IF she really wasnt involved in her kids life for SEVEN years. Having a kid at 15 means you likely got pregnant at 14. When a child has a child I don't think that placing blames fully on them is a great idea, nor is punishing them for the rest of their lives. She didn't commit murder, she didn't molest somebody, she had a kid. If you are telling the truth and she didn't really care about her child for 7 years then yes, she's an asshole. If she was out partying all night for years she's an asshole. If she was leaning heavily on support because she was finishing an education, that doesn't make her an asshole. The timeline matches up to graduation. My guess is that she's not guilty and not an asshole, and she didn't assume you'd harbor a lifetime of resentment while making choices to support her. \n\n3. From reading your updates it sounds like you were rather unclear on your post. 1st of all comment your husband is their father which wasn't quite clear and 2nd of all come at you aren't totally disinheriting them, you are giving 2 million to charity off the assumption that your husband won't need the money, and when he passes, he will give an inheritance to both children and the grandkids. So it's not so much that you are disinheriting both children as that your husband thinks giving your daughter some level inheritance upon your death instead of his would be helpful to her because she's in financial trouble. \n\nIf I've got all of that right, then you probably aren't *as* bad of a person as your post makes it sound. Normally, most couples wouldn't pass on an inheritance to the children before both partners die because the cost of retirement, in home care, or a nursing home is outrageous (in the millions, you can be elderly for many years if genetics allow) It sounds like both of you have wealth that is substantial enough that you don't have to worry about that.  But it isn't that odd for your kids to not receive an inheritance when you pass and instead receive it when your husband passes, which is what you are planning.\n\nSo why are you the asshole?\n\nThe kids. And the spite.\n\nIf you truly have wealth that is substantial, your husband is independently rich and your grandkids are living in a disadvantaged situation, it makes a lot more sense to try to help them out now. The situation they are in at present will set up the rest of their lives. Maybe you don't need to give a ton of money to their mother but you could set up a situation like a better house that's paid off, or address that takes care of the children's needs and only the children's needs. It seems like you are so hell bent on punishing their mother for something that there well being isn't at the front of your mind, which is frankly very weird & feels assholish for no reason.\n\nYou wouldn't have to give all 2 million of it to anybody. Or 1 mil for that matter.  Although if you did give some early inheritance to your daughter it would also make sense to give some to your son just for the sake of not favoring one kid. Unless someone has done something unconscionable that you have left out of your post, I doubt there is reason to be cruel. It sounds very much like your daughter needed help for 7 years because 15 + 7 is 22 and that's high school and college. So yes of course she needed help during that time. I find it really weird that you calculated helping your daughter and now want to deduct that from her inheritance as if she committed a crime she needs to pay for.\n\nYou would be an asshole too, not because you can't do whatever you want with your money. You can. It belongs to you and no one else and nobody is entitled to it. But this forum isn't are you legally in the right or are you entitled to something, it's are you an asshole. And it sounds like you are denying your children out of spite, and spite alone.\n\nI'm very sorry for your terminal diagnosis and I'm sorry that your husband has caused such an acrimonious, painful last year for you. It may be that your children are not close to you or kind to you or you are not wishing to give them an inheritance for some other reason. If we are going based solely off your post it feels like spite for childhood choices. If it's more nuance than that, maybe you're not the asshole, but based off what I'm reading, everyone sucks.", "Even if we agree to suspend our belief a bit and choose to believe it was nothing to do with OP's parenting, her daughter was 15 and made a mistake, which still shouldn't be held against her forever by her dying parent who at least got to have and know grandchildren.\n\nBut also, how is OP not the asshole when she could choose to significantly improve the life of her child who - as far as we know - hasn't done anything particularly wrong and does have a relationship with her, but OP *just doesn't want to*.", "And she didn't throw her life away, did she? \n\nShe seems to be doing okay, right?

(It is also pretty telling that OP barely acknowledges her son.) \n\nOP's daughter is living in a trailer and struggling, probably in big part to the decisions she made as a 15 year old. That's not OP's fault, but when a child gets pregnant - you probably should do some self reflection about your parenting..... I just couldn't imagine knowing the end is near and wanting my last acts on this world to be fueled by pettiness.", "And Bill leaving money for the kids/ grandkids doesn\u2019t help them now! He\u2019s 66, there\u2019s a chance he could live another 30 years! That won\u2019t help them get out of the trailer or with future tuition costs.", "I'm definitely getting ultra conservative family vibes from this woman for her failure to teach daughter about contraception and not helping her get an abortion. Agree that trust funds for the kids is the least OP could do.", "I agree mostly but I really don't think it was their parents choice to abort their daughters child.", "I work in charity. We would love a \u00a32m donation but not one made out of spite. \u00a31m would be a dream from a private individual and her children still get looked after", "YTA- you very obviously sound like you\u2019ve got an issue with your children. I\u2019m wondering what has gone on that has made you feel this degree of anger towards them. I want you to consider how being left out of their mothers will will impact your children. This is coming from personal knowledge as my grandmother chose to leave her children out of her will. My dad was so devastated that she treated him like that it affected him for many years to come.\n\nI feel like you\u2019re leaving a big chunk of the story out as to why you don\u2019t wanna leave money to either one of your children.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about how she/they are going to spend the money, why don\u2019t you set up a trust, that sets up a payout schedule. Or setup to help the grand kids out. Maybe have it geared towards their education.\n\nAlthough, I think it\u2019s laudable to want to donate to charity, there\u2019s nothing wrong, and helping your children out along the way as well.", "A high proportion of teenage pregnancies have a much older father. How this happened and why OP is blaming a child for becoming pregnant are the crux of this.", "i'll put money on it being abstinence only sex ed. which actually results in higher rates of teen pregnancy", "I don\u2019t even think she loves her money OR cares about charity.\n\nDefinitely give us the vibes of a narcissist who wants to manufacturer a respectable legacy for herself (OP, the noble humanitarian who gave her life savings away ) despite the fact that her entire family is probably counting the days until this gone. \n\nSad asf", "Yup, classic Boomer nonsense. Textbook case of boomer\u2019s favorite tactic: climbing the ladder then kicking it over", "Yes", "Imagine wrangling up your kids from a trailer park to wait in line for an ounce of the charity that your mom gave away to strangers.\n\n I have never hated an OP so much.", "Yes. This is what was on my mind, too.\n\nOP, is that the dying thought that you want to leave with any loved one - \"I've done enough for you already. Bye now!\"\n\nMy (step)kids have done much worse than anything you mention your daughter doing - not dinner table topic stuff. We ended up getting 7 grandkids given to us by CPS. That was 10\u00bd years ago and 2 of them are still under 18 and living with us. I've been used and abused and lie to. I've been threatened. I've lost so much. It's been so bad that I've wondered if I've offended God, Satan, or some random rock somewhere to the point that I feel like I'm being punished for it.\n\nThe thing is that my response to it all is about who I am and who I want to be. I don't want to become who I didn't even want them to be. I want their last memories of me to be loving and gracious. Whether they feel cared for or spited by that is on them. I wish I was loving enough to not even have that last thought in my head but I'm working on it.\n\nI hope you find a way to get rid of your resentments before you run out of chances, regardless of what you do with the money.", "My thoughts would be .25 to the son and daughter, with the remaining .5 in a trust due the grands.   But that's because I actually live my family or some other insane reason.   So yes, the op is completely YTA in this instance.", "Wait, am I the only person wanting to know WHY this person\u2019s son just walked away? How are they somehow the good guy if their son had to cut them out of his life? What did they do to his wife? Why is everyone praising the person who was such a butthead to their son\u2019s wife that he actually had to cut them and his grandparents out of their lives?? Because they said they loved their son? What?! \n\nTotally makes me think of that article about narcissistic parents who insist they love their children and have NO IDEA what they did wrong to make their mean children cut them out of their lives.", "Thank you for saying this. I\u2019m an adult child who had to set boundaries with my mom and went no contact for about three months. My first thought when reading the above comment was that the son absolutely had a reason for walking out of her life. \n\nIt isn\u2019t easy for adult children to decide to not have a relationship with their parents. It\u2019s usually for a lot of reasons and often the parents would know the reasons if they actually listened. I\u2019m so glad you took the time and effort to heal with your child. My mom has done some work, but not near the amount of work it sounds like you\u2019re doing. I know your son feels loved by your effort alone.", "Here is the comment I was looking for, the financial climate is horrible right now. OP is blinded by their own failure as a parent and would rather let her kids deal with the world on their own instead of helping them in one of the only ways they could actually see her as a parent. I\u2019m appalled by this behavior, I don\u2019t even think twice when I feed my kids first and myself second. It\u2019s my job to care and nurture them, OP gives parents a bad name. There is more I\u2019d want to say but I\u2019d rather stop there than get more frustrated by this high horsed buffoon.", "I think part of the bootstrap mindset is also ignoring she failed her daughter. Teen mom, living in a trailer, while her parents keep millions.\n\nThis daughter probably lost her mother long ago, if she ever had a good one to begin with.", "If her daughter is anything like most of her generation, even $50k would probably be a beyond life changing amount of money. Hell, if someone was able to spare me $20k it would literally rewrite the course of my entire future. \n\nImagine having 2mil and not even consider throwing a (comparatively) small bone to your kid(s)?", "\u201cWhen I am dead let fire the earth consume\u201d.

I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way but you\u2019re right.", "I wonder if they ever checked to make sure she was a willing member in the conception. At 15, it's a toss-up. Not a lot of experience staying safe and avoiding creeps and predators, and not a lot of experience with self-control either.", "Yep, so 3 of the 7 years of child care were her legal responsibility.\n\nSo she spent for additional years helping her daughter raise the child.  \n\nMaybe because she\u2019s sooooooo transactional, she\u2019ll agree to give Amity 3 years of child care money as an inheritance instead \ud83e\udd79", "He\u2019s obviously done something, since OP\u2019s excuse for not leaving the daughter anything was that 7 years of childcare was \u201cenough\u201d, and daughter shouldn\u2019t expect anything else ever again. \n\nLike, even though I don\u2019t agree with it, I can at least understand the feeling about not wanting to support the daughter further. \n\nBut there are two kids here. One of the two million dollars should have been going to him, right?\n\nWtf did he do to piss OP off, forget to make his bed too many times as a teen?", "My sympathies. It\u2019s hard to explain this hurt without sounding entitled Princess isn\u2019t it?\n\nMy parents are wealthy. I did not realise the extent when younger because I didn\u2019t pick up the coded statements or hidden narratives about my mum\u2019s family having sold a huge farm when I was about 5. I\u2019m a city kid. My aunt worked in a bank so I for ages assumed the family just had good habits. My parents had teacher level jobs and partly raised me to budget in sensible ways and partly acted like if I asked for a birthday cake we would be bankrupt. \n\nThey were godawful parents and I never knew when they were lying. Their divorce was murky and it took working backwards as an adult to realise they were worth millions. Millions they hoard. They cut me off at 16 because I was not the child they liked. Scapegoat but also female, disabled, queer and annoyingly not compliant.\n\nI ended up homeless and my parents refused to either gift or loan me a rental deposit. I was homeless because I was attacked and had to leave my house. \u00a31500 would have changed my life. Instead I lived in hostels for over a year until I was placed in social housing. I lost my job, had a breakdown, ended up on welfare and for the only time in my life incurred debt by paying for storage to keep my worldly possessions on credit card. I calculated this was cheaper than replacing it all when housed.\n\nWhen I moved in, they did not even send a housewarming card let alone a gift. I paid for all my furniture etc over the last 18 years and in the end the fact I had the social housing freed me from them to go no contact. \u00a31500 would have trapped me. But it was still agonising knowing my parents could afford to help me, they just didn\u2019t want to or care to.\n\nMy mum built a summerhouse in her garden for \u00a340000. She lives in Ireland. Summer is 5 minutes long. But she has never helped me when homeless or to pay off that debt. I did it all myself and when people said \u2018don\u2019t be so proud, ask your family. They would be heartbroken if they knew\u2019 I had to say \u2018they know. They just don\u2019t care.\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t expect to inherit because that is not how no contact goes but it will still hurt when my parents make a deliberate statement in writing in one of the most important legal documents an adult ever makes which is also public record that they pick the donkey sanctuary over their own child and wish everyone to know that is the final act of their life.\n\nMoney cannot buy love but it can symbolise it and it can weaponise it. When your chump change is someone else\u2019s life or death and you taunt with that, wishing for the money is not entitlement. It\u2019s grief. But rich parents and family are a hard world to explain without people assuming you are greedy and money makes life simple.\n\nI hope things look up for you. I have no advice. I just wanted to say I know how much it hurts and is oddly lonely. I see many families with very little material asset and an abundance of love, practical efforts and empathy and it is a world away from families who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.", "Maybe because of the cancer she needs to smoke to make the meal look delicious?", "Listen, I just made a comment about my mother, who WAS a doctor, responsible human, wife, etc. and STILL hit some major bumps along the way & needed her parent\u2019s help.

Every kid will be different, and yep, some will become doctors and then might also still go off the rails. As a parent my love is unconditional. As I mentioned further down you can put restrictions on a trust, you don\u2019t just have to hand the cash over and worry about it being wasted if that\u2019s the concern. I just cannot understand any parent giving it to charity just cause, \u2018she should achieve it on her own.
