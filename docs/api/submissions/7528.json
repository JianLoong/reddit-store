She had her son at 15 and because she was in high school Bill and Iended up raising him until he was 7. We also paid for Amity's college. My reasoning is that we have already given her childcare for seven years and college, so she already received the payout from us even though I was alive and well at the time. \n\nThough it seems Bill already told Amity we'd help her out and she was getting half the inheritance, so I had to correct her and tell her I'm not giving her or her brother any money. \nThis has been blowing up the family. Amity was furious because she says she's in a bad financial place and she can't believe I'm not helping her even though I could. Bill understands where I'm coming from but says Amity is living in a trailer and I could at least help her out.

You can do whatever you want with your money, but it's very cold that your daughter needs financial help and you won't help her because you \"already did.\" Even worse that you're holding her having a kid as a 15 year old against her. She was just a kid.", "YTA - I'm voting this way because I think you really resent your daughter for getting pregnant at 15.  She made a mistake.  She didn't rob a bank.", "INFO: Why aren't you helping her brother either?", "Why are you cutting your kids out? Did they do something wrong?", "It might be unpopular but YTA \n\nYou have the opportunity to ensure your daughter, son and grandkids have a financially secure future in a climate where things are hard and getting harder.\n\nYou\u2019re keeping a scorecard of previous parenting are patting yourself on the back and consider your parenting done.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s your money and your decision, I just think it\u2019s the wrong one.", "INFO: is Bill their father? Is there more to the story between you and your daughter? It sounds like basically she disappointed you by having a baby so young and you\u2019re still punishing her for it. Please correct me if this isn\u2019t the case.", "YTA. When a kid has a kid at 15, it's not the kid's fault, or at least not mostly. It's a parenting fail to not provide birth control (preferably long-term), guidance, and some coaching on how to handle pressure in a relationship. At the VERY least, it was YOUR choice to keep and raise the kid rather than abort, adopt, place with family, place with the FATHER'S family, etc.  So you screwed her over when she was a teen, but at least you did pay for college and stepped up to raise him. And why are you not, at the very least, putting it in trust funds for the grandkids? Even if you don't care about what happens to Amity, what about your grandbabies? Are they supposed to pay for her not making you happy?", "I mean you can do whatever you want with your money but that doesn't mean people in your life, mainly your family, won't think you're TA.

YTA, and big time.\n\nAt the beginning I wondered if your daughter is well off and that's why you want to give away your money. But she lives in a trailer park. A trailer park! Do you know what that kind of money can do to help someone in such a bad situation? You're essentially choosing to help random people over your own kids _who are in need_.\n\nSorry but YTA.", "YTA you're going to be charitable to others and not your kids? That's cold.", "YTA. I understand you don't want to leave anything to your daughter, though I think you are callous, but what did your son do to be ignored in the will? I get it. You want to punish your daughter, but your son apparently has done nothing to warrant that.\n\nBut I think it's ironic you want to donate to charity, BUT you are okay with your daughter living in a trailer park. Sounds to me you just don't like your children.", "YTA. I get it\u2019s your money and whatever, but I can\u2019t imagine bypassing my own children when I have a mass of wealth I\u2019ll be losing after I\u2019m dead.\n\nAlso you resent your underaged child for getting pregnant. That was your failing as a parent. She was a kid.", "YTA, not because you\u2019re leaving the money to charity, but because you\u2019re doing so not because you have love for charity/humanity, but because you want to punish your daughter for getting pregnant as a teenager. You are deciding that your last act in life is to hurt your family. That will be your legacy, the way you are remembered. Not as a person who cared so much she left everything to charity, but as a woman who had so little love in her that she purposefully didn\u2019t do anything to help her own family when she could have.", "You can do whatever you want with your money. But it's wrong to hold such resentment toward your child because she was got pregnant at a young age and you helped her raise your grandchild. And it's wrong to hold you paying for her college against her. A parent-child relationship is not transactional. Furthermore, why wouldn't you want her to have that money so she can move out of her trailer? I'm not trying to be on a high horse here, but this just seems wrong.", "Soft YTA. 1. With inflation, how do you know Bill won\u2019t need the money if he lives a long time? 2. What about your son? He didn\u2019t get any help and now gets nothing? 3. Why don\u2019t you want to help your daughter and grandchildren not live in a trailer? Even buying them a home could make a small dent and they would be set. You could even put it in a trust if you didn\u2019t want amity to control it.", "It's your money, but I'm going to say that YTA for your reasoning. Having a pregnancy *at 15* is at least as much an indictment on the parents as the child, and treating that and her college like a purely financial transaction (which is nowhere near $1M) seems extremely assholish to me; you're effectively punishing her for the fact y'all failed her as parents when she was a teen and for totally normal, if nice, support during college.\n\nE: Regarding the edit:\n\n> Edit to clarify: Bill is going to leave everything to the children/grandchildren when he passes. Caleb hasn't done anything, but they will both be getting money regardless.\n\nThis doesn't really make things better. For one thing, it makes the your entire argument about why your daughter doesn't \"deserve\" her inheritance moot; you lied to us and you lied to her about the reasoning, because it's just \"I don't wanna!\"\n\nAnd, like, sure, if you don't want to give them money you don't have to, but the fact is that if your finances are so segregated that you can give out $2,000,000 to charity on your own, you can't use your husband as a shield for randomly cutting your kids off for no reason. They're your kids too, it's still an AH move to cut them off arbitrarily and it's certainly an AH move to invent justifications for it you don't actually care about.", "YTA - even after your edit. You should be putting a portion into a trust.  One for the grandkids one for the daughter and son. With a trust you can still have stipulations such as money is only to be spent on xyz.... prior to your edit, all you were doing is making the grandkids suffer and potentially stunt their growth as good human beings by making it needlessly harder on your daughter because of your resenting judment of when or how capable she was when she had children.", "info: how did your daughter get pregnant at 14/15 and have a baby at 15?Did she not have good sex education? Did she not have access to abortion? Why or why not?", "First of all I'd say that I'm sorry for what you're going through. \n\nSecond, it seems like there is something more here you're not telling us about your daughter. Is there animosity? Do you think she's not responsible? Your post implies it. Simply refusing to include your daughter in the will because you already paid for her college and childcare is kinda trivial in my opinion. Especially when you know she is in a bad financial situation. What about your son? \n\nat the end of the day it's your choice but if I was someone in a bad financial place and find out my dying mother wasn't leaving me anything I would feel a type of way as well. \n\nAgain, if she's irresponsible then it makes sense. I just wonder what about you son makes you deny him too?", "INFO. Why don\u2019t you want to leave anything to your son either? It\u2019s an AH move, at least in my eyes to not want to leave anything at all to your children when they need it (or at least one does as evident). Are you fine with your daughter living in a trailer with your grandchildren? Why wouldn\u2019t you want to help when you can? Did they do something to warrant leaving them out of the will?\n\nEdit: I originally said they weren\u2019t an AH by technicality since it\u2019s their money but I take that back since their reasoning is also AH-ish and an AH is still an AH.", "I mean, it is your money but wow, YTA.\n\nLet me get this straight... You'd rather donate your money to complete strangers than help your own flesh and blood (who sound like they are struggling) to succeed in life? Because of why exactly? A teenage pregnancy?\n\nHarsh.\n\nYou can justify however you want, it's your money afterall. Your children are losing their mother, and that's the memory you want them to have? It sounds like you hold a huge grudge, and are on a mission to ensure your own children don't show up at your funeral.\n\nI'd reconsider your choice if you want to preserve whatever is left of your relationship with your children before you die. They're your legacy. If you want to live on, it'll be through them.\n\nIf you have 1 charity, 2 children, and 3 grandchildren, divide your money in 6, spread the wealth equally at the very least, leaving the grands funds in trust until they're 25 or something.", "YTA - Missing, missing reasons", "Ok, big question though - What charity?", "Have you considered leaving the money in a trust for your grandkids? I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, but YTA. Who is to say someone from one of those charities hasn\u2019t received some big generosity, but you\u2019re willing to help them?

Did whatever charity tell you they can't name the building after you unless it's the whole $2 mil?", "If she has kids and one that is already close to college bound, why not save set money aside to give the grandkids a good start at life? That way Bill isn't stuck with with total responsibility when you pass. He seems to want to take care of things. It is your money so you can do whatever you want but if you care about Bill, I would figure something out so that he has peace of mind too.", "I would put it in a trust so they can't blow the money, but can almost get a monthly allowance per say.

Five years ago, my son (whom I love to the ends of the earth and back), at the request of his wife, took our two precious and only grandchildren and walked out of our lives. Abandoned us.  No address. No phone calls, no texts.  No birthdays. No Christmases.  No messages to his 93 and 94 year old grandparents.  Long, deep, ugly, painful silence. From the kid we loved, sheltered, and supported with every drop of our beings for 28 years.\n\nDo you know how many people told us to cut them out of our will?  I lost count. But I refuse. This kid is heart of my heart.  Love of my life.  He always will be.  And I refuse to take the low road and treat him - or his family - badly. In the end, love is love is love.

You state you already gave a lot to your daughter, why aren't you leaving anything to your son? You seem to have a lot of resentment to your daughter. Did raising her kids prevent you from having the life you imagined or is it something else.

That's nice, but it seems like they need the money sooner then in thebyears to follow. why not leave the money to your husband to save for the kids or to setup a trust so they can get a little extra income monthly or something for your grandkids.

Youre as much at fault for her mistakes as a child as she is! I don't think she should be punished for struggling as a mum when she was a literal child herself! I also generally don't believe most charities actually do much for those in need so it's like you would rather burn your money than see your kids be comfortable and I'll just never understand parents like that. I was homeless for half my childhood and I would sell my insides if it meant my son will never experience that. It just seems really, cold, to leave your children nothing knowing they need help. And to resent your own child for needing help? That's just whack.", "YTA.  It is your money and of course you can decide where it goes.  However, your actions seem designed to cause pain, to in effect say that you don\u2019t care about your children and grandkids.  This makes you the AH here.  Dying people don\u2019t come to this decision though without some provocation, so this post is really missing the backstory that would mitigate an AH judgement.", "YTA - I could understand not leaving everything to them and setting up a trust with some conditions but to leave both children and grandchildren absolutely nothing seems petty.

Do you realise most charities are just rich peoples fax free bank accounts and dont actually help? \n\nAnyway your daughter is literally in a bad financial place and you're leaving her with nothing? Not even 50k? 5k? Absolutely nothing at all?\n\nDonate most of your money if you have too but give your kids something. They do not have the same privilege you had growing up.

They wasted ALL of their money on brand new toys and luxuries and whatever else. It was their money they could do what they wanted. But now my parents, my siblings, cousins and me are below the poverty line. I will never own a house, or be able to have children.
