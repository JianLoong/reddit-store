It's almost become trendy? Which is weird. He probably saw a tiktok video with generic symptoms listed and latched onto it, honestly. And him doing so makes it a lot harder for people who actually have it.\n\nIf you need to get better proof to show your mom, hit up r/mcas and on the toolbar they have a whole diagnostic criteria and everything.", "ESH- It is ableist to just assume your brother doesn't have these conditions. That said, self diagnosis is NOT something that should be done with connective tissue disorders and other genetic conditions, which makes your brother TA for wanting others to take his chronic illness seriously when he is not doing so at all.\n\nIf your brother receives a diagnosis from a geneticist  then you and any future children you have are also more likely to have HEDS or a similar condition so he and you both need to visit a geneticist. You may have a milder firm of hypermobility syndrome for example, but one of your children have a more severe form of EDS. \n\nBack when EDS was fairly unknown (say early 2000's) getting an HEDS diagnosis took a geneticist and a ton of testing and paperwork. I know the condition was first mentioned to me as fitting my symptoms in 1998, but I was actually diagnosed with it until 2015.  That many years to be diagnosed with such an odd condition isn't unheard of. I know the geneticist I met with who diagnosed my family immediately gave me a referral to a cardiologist who specialized in POTS and other dysautonomia, and that doctor referred me to be checked for MCAS/MCAD. The three conditions are pretty much a trifecta of comorbidities so it isn't odd to have all three.\n\nThat said, HEDS is suddenly a \"popular\" diagnosis and since hypermobility is not uncommon, some doctors and lots of patients with chronic pain may be diagnosing themselves and others incorrectly. Which leads to doctors not believing patients have it at all, to the point I carry a copy of my diagnosis letter from my geneticist with me when meeting a new doctor because I've had to many make disparaging comments or doubt my diagnosis.\n\nIf your brother really does think he has these conditions, not getting diagnosed is dangerous for him. He needs a medical care team. If he is willing to travel, Baltimore has amazing specialists in diagnosing and treating EDS and its cormorbidities that would be worth a long visit. That said, I've heard there is a 2 year waiting list for some of them :(\n\nYour brother needs to treat his issues as the serious medical conditions they could be. There are other forms of connective tissue disorders that have dangerous heart involvement and more risk of retinol detachment and aortic disstention. He needs to get recommendations from the local EDS support groups of doctors in the area who are aware of HEDS, and should be seeing a cardiologist, a rheumatologist, a geneticist, an optometrist, an allergist and even physical therapists. \n\nAnd if he continues to not be diagnosed with any chronic issues, OP needs to be willing to discuss her brother's possible mental illness with her mother. But she shouldn't assume that is the case.", "NTA\n\nIt's very difficult to deal with people who lie and manipulate to get the attention they need.

These things we call \"mental illnesses\" are caused by real issues in the body. Our thoughts are neurotransmitters and nerve impulses in our physical brains.

Haha\n\nETA wow thanks everyone! You've all been super helpful :)", "On the one hand, these three are difficult to diagnose, but on the other it's more that they're difficult to pin down as those specific things. Work ups and tests will show that *something* is wrong. I'm in the process of figuring out if I have hEDS and MCAS myself.

He could also tell my allergies are weird, but I haven't had my appointment with the allergist yet to figure out the MCAS aspect.\n\nWhich is a long-winded way of saying OP's brother would have something show up by now if he really has those conditions and has seen that many doctors.", "Forgive me if I'm wrong but aren't all of them easily disproved by objective medical exam? \n\nI have generalized joint hypermobility syndrome, diagnosed by ortho and endo.

The blisters were something spectacular, looked like I had wrested with an octopus.\nWe found out I have mild tachicardia but it's not posture related and low BP, it just happens and it's nothing concerning, just more frequent ECG to keep an eye on it. \n\nThe most likely culprit for my love of floors in summer is weak vein valves in legs, possibly linked to the connective tissue disorder.

A good allergist can diagnose you with MCAS. There are tests that can be done to determine MCAS, but unfortunately it can be really hard to catch a MCAS diagnosis through the tests (blood tryptase) because of how quickly it changes and the samples need to be perfectly kept in certain conditions. Any allergist (or doctor) who claims you have to be positive on the tests to have it is not a good doctor for it.

It was a therapist who finally told me that anxiety does not make you faint and that something is clearly wrong but it's not anxiety.

Basically, it's often coupled with neglect or their own experiences with illness. Sometimes being ill for a long time makes it hard to figure out who you are without the illness, I was terrified of handling my depression because I was scared I wouldn't have a personality, so self imposed illness makes this more predictable. \n\nUnfortunately there's no treatment for fictitious disorder so far - but it's classed as a mental disorder for a reason.

The second time I did the test I couldn't touch my toes even though I did the first test which had something to do with the EDS but I didn't really understand which is why I still scored for touching my toes even though I couldn't. My sister was pediatric when we got our diagnosis so she couldn't see the actual doctor but since my mom and I got diagnosed and she showed similar symptoms he gave her the official diagnosis anyway. I'm the only one with EDS in my family who doesn't have elastic skin.
