POTS is the only one that is more invisible than the others, is underdiagnosed, and i wouldnt be surprised if he had - but the main reason why it's underdiagnosed is because it's also very common and easy to diagnose and most doctors wont diagnose you unless you ask for a diagnosis, at least from what ive heard/in my experience. honestly, im kinda pissed off at him for not at least researching the medical issues he's trying to have and not trying to chose more easily fakeable illnesses lmfao. dude obviously has some serious problems and some serious disconnect with his own body, but his mom is actively hindering his recovery by choosing to ignore the facts. you were right to tell her she is in denial, and her attitude almost makes me wonder if she's straight up encouraging him to claim medical problems.", "He doesn\u2019t want to work or make the effort to go to school.", "NTA.

Hopefully your brother can get his mental stuff under control before he procreates (honestly, there\u2019s probably a LOT more going on mentally that JUST the factitious disorder, which is fairly common); because a lot of the time, and I\u2019m going to use the throwback terms here for clarity, Munchausen Syndrome can easily turn into Munchausen by Proxy when someone who suffers with that illness has children or other vulnerable people they end up caring for.

Does he report pain or discomfort in red body parts, particularly burning pain? MCAS is a relatively common cause of redness, especially in the hands. But isn't related to h-EDS or POTS.\n\nBut there is one condition that is very rare that has those redness symptoms, causes pain/discomfort,  and has h-EDS and POTS as common comorbidities. This condition is notable as MCAS is on the differential diagnosis. \n\nIf all that sounds familiar then your brother should be evaluated for erythromelalgia. The website of The Erythromelalgia Association has a Physician Directory listing medical providers familiar with the condition. \n\nErythromelalgia is so rare that most doctors have never seen a case.
