It's almost become trendy? Which is weird. He probably saw a tiktok video with generic symptoms listed and latched onto it, honestly. And him doing so makes it a lot harder for people who actually have it.\n\nIf you need to get better proof to show your mom, hit up r/mcas and on the toolbar they have a whole diagnostic criteria and everything.", "ESH- It is ableist to just assume your brother doesn't have these conditions. That said, self diagnosis is NOT something that should be done with connective tissue disorders and other genetic conditions, which makes your brother TA for wanting others to take his chronic illness seriously when he is not doing so at all.\n\nIf your brother receives a diagnosis from a geneticist  then you and any future children you have are also more likely to have HEDS or a similar condition so he and you both need to visit a geneticist. You may have a milder firm of hypermobility syndrome for example, but one of your children have a more severe form of EDS. \n\nBack when EDS was fairly unknown (say early 2000's) getting an HEDS diagnosis took a geneticist and a ton of testing and paperwork. I know the condition was first mentioned to me as fitting my symptoms in 1998, but I was actually diagnosed with it until 2015.  That many years to be diagnosed with such an odd condition isn't unheard of. I know the geneticist I met with who diagnosed my family immediately gave me a referral to a cardiologist who specialized in POTS and other dysautonomia, and that doctor referred me to be checked for MCAS/MCAD. The three conditions are pretty much a trifecta of comorbidities so it isn't odd to have all three.\n\nThat said, HEDS is suddenly a \"popular\" diagnosis and since hypermobility is not uncommon, some doctors and lots of patients with chronic pain may be diagnosing themselves and others incorrectly. Which leads to doctors not believing patients have it at all, to the point I carry a copy of my diagnosis letter from my geneticist with me when meeting a new doctor because I've had to many make disparaging comments or doubt my diagnosis.\n\nIf your brother really does think he has these conditions, not getting diagnosed is dangerous for him. He needs a medical care team. If he is willing to travel, Baltimore has amazing specialists in diagnosing and treating EDS and its cormorbidities that would be worth a long visit. That said, I've heard there is a 2 year waiting list for some of them :(\n\nYour brother needs to treat his issues as the serious medical conditions they could be. There are other forms of connective tissue disorders that have dangerous heart involvement and more risk of retinol detachment and aortic disstention. He needs to get recommendations from the local EDS support groups of doctors in the area who are aware of HEDS, and should be seeing a cardiologist, a rheumatologist, a geneticist, an optometrist, an allergist and even physical therapists. \n\nAnd if he continues to not be diagnosed with any chronic issues, OP needs to be willing to discuss her brother's possible mental illness with her mother. But she shouldn't assume that is the case.", "NTA\n\nIt's very difficult to deal with people who lie and manipulate to get the attention they need.

These things we call \"mental illnesses\" are caused by real issues in the body. Our thoughts are neurotransmitters and nerve impulses in our physical brains.

Haha\n\nETA wow thanks everyone! You've all been super helpful :)", "On the one hand, these three are difficult to diagnose, but on the other it's more that they're difficult to pin down as those specific things. Work ups and tests will show that *something* is wrong. I'm in the process of figuring out if I have hEDS and MCAS myself.

He could also tell my allergies are weird, but I haven't had my appointment with the allergist yet to figure out the MCAS aspect.\n\nWhich is a long-winded way of saying OP's brother would have something show up by now if he really has those conditions and has seen that many doctors.", "Forgive me if I'm wrong but aren't all of them easily disproved by objective medical exam? \n\nI have generalized joint hypermobility syndrome, diagnosed by ortho and endo.

The blisters were something spectacular, looked like I had wrested with an octopus.\nWe found out I have mild tachicardia but it's not posture related and low BP, it just happens and it's nothing concerning, just more frequent ECG to keep an eye on it. \n\nThe most likely culprit for my love of floors in summer is weak vein valves in legs, possibly linked to the connective tissue disorder.

A good allergist can diagnose you with MCAS. There are tests that can be done to determine MCAS, but unfortunately it can be really hard to catch a MCAS diagnosis through the tests (blood tryptase) because of how quickly it changes and the samples need to be perfectly kept in certain conditions. Any allergist (or doctor) who claims you have to be positive on the tests to have it is not a good doctor for it.

It was a therapist who finally told me that anxiety does not make you faint and that something is clearly wrong but it's not anxiety.

Basically, it's often coupled with neglect or their own experiences with illness. Sometimes being ill for a long time makes it hard to figure out who you are without the illness, I was terrified of handling my depression because I was scared I wouldn't have a personality, so self imposed illness makes this more predictable. \n\nUnfortunately there's no treatment for fictitious disorder so far - but it's classed as a mental disorder for a reason.

Unfortunately self-diagnosis happens because very few docs have training in diseases such as POTS/MCAS/mecfs/post viral illnesses such as long COVID and patient groups with the help of the very few specialty centers provide outreach to help patients suffering with symptoms that are prevalent in these to guide them to help. Long COVID is the most recent example of a similar (post viral illnesses) that is finally turning the tide on labeling undiagnosed patients as having a mental disorder instead of a very real physiological illness. Often conversion disorder or other mental illness labels are used because the science behind these diseases has been woefully underfunded for decades.", "I think this is past the point of social media making you aware of a disorder and you show symptoms so you suspect you might have it.

It's hard wired into our brains to occupy ourselves with something productive.  Even if it's in a way that doesn't make much money. People who avoid this avoid it for a reason. Like extreme anxiety, PTSD, fear of failure or the judgement of others. So they say they don't want to, or can't be bothered, or are too unwell. But it usually has a root cause in a fear based mental health condition.", "Bullcrap, doctors 99% of the time turn to mental disorders for these and other diseases (mecfs/post-viral illnesses/long COVID) because they are not trained in them, are arrogant and don\u2019t listen to their patients.

Even worse, I see you are from England which is notorious for having a medical system that is awful for knowing about POTS/MCAS/mecfs/post viral illnesses. \nHow do I know this? I am someone with a few of these disorders who primary care and specialists couldn\u2019t diagnose  after all kinds of tests came back negative. It took a post-viral specialty center here in the US to make the diagnosis at quite the expense not covered by insurance. \n\ntldr; your brother is claiming diseases that are little understood in mainstream medicine and have patients suffering for decades often gaslit that their symptoms aren\u2019t real. It can take years/decades to find a physician who understands these diseases to make a diagnosis (often of exclusion) after many other common diseases are ruled out.
