However I am always learning new words, or hearing words used differently. We never stop learning or adding to our vocabulary.\n\nI mainly teach Asian students, and only adults, who often approach me with this phrase, 'I'd like to book a lesson with you because I want to improve my oral English', so I make a lesson out of that phrase. Usually we come up with approximately 25 alternative words we could use to make that same sentence, and on average my students know 20-23 of the alternatives but can't think of them at that moment. This happens to all of us at times. Often we simply cannot think of a word we need. We know it but it just doesn't come to mind when needed.\n\nI do not think I am a very good teacher, but I am always trying to expand my students knowledge, understanding and communication skills. I try hard.\n\nI commend your brother on wanting to to be a teacher, as it is not an easy job. But I do think he needs to expand his vocabulary considerably.

Lovecraft, for example)... and when I do, I look them up.  In a dictionary, generally, although I often encounter new slang or acronyms, in which case I go to my favourite websites specializing in them. \n\nIf he's going to teach English... he has got to get in the habit of looking up words himself. And you're right that he needs to know more than his students.  Otherwise... he's gong to have students realize that his command of English isn't much better than theirs, and he's going to have trouble getting and/or keeping their respect.

So, to me it shouldn't really be a big deal for you to simply tell him what you mean in reference to the conversation you are having.  But i get it.  If you have to explain the definition of every word you use, then it becomes exhausting.\n\nThis reminded me of that scene in Kives Out: Glass Onion, when Ed Norton was talking to the group and every word out of his mouth was \"almost\" right. He was using words to sound educated. When i watched it, i was like this sounds completely off for some reason.  Daniel Craig later goes on to explain all this, and i was like \"i knew that whole scene was weird\"\n\nGave me a good little chuckle", "NTA, he needed to hear it.

The shortages are getting worse by the day. Meanwhile, I hope the following makes you feel better: Surprisingly many of the best teachers you'll ever find went through serious struggles with their chosen subjects. There is education research saying that having difficulties AND OVERCOMING THEM makes one a better teacher in the long run. Teachers need to know what students' difficulties might be and to have compassion. Having had personal difficulties helps with both. In fact, teacher's stellar knowledge of the subject makes surprisingly little difference in the success of that teacher's students. There are studies of that as well. That's even true for subjects like mathematics. \n\nOn the other hand, being an actual poet? That's awesome for teaching English!\n\nIt looks like your brother IS trying to learn. He's learning by asking someone who's close and who probably can explain words in a more human, fun, and relatable way than a dictionary ever could (you). Learning phrases in conversation with a close friend works better for many learners at all levels. It could also be a fun family activity. It looks like your worries about your brother's future stand in the way of you enjoying these neat learning moments together. Maybe the two of you, or just you, could talk to some actual teachers about their past struggles and learning journeys (teachers have a good subreddit here) or read some articles on the art of teachers' professional development.

Great app. Meybe it will help.", "That reminds me of my 7th grade English teacher.\n\nWe had to write poetry one class - the 'poem' I 'wrote' was one of the riddles from The Hobbit (this was late 90's so before the movies), because I hated writing poetry.
