The American dream so to speak. We are from SouthAsia (around India). \nAs the oldest daughter I of course have always had a lot of responsibilities and I was always expected to be the perfect child. So I went to the college they wanted me to go to (close to home).  I got a full ride (including housing) so my parents would did not have that as a burden. I worked really hard in high school (also expected of me) and the scholarship was my way of showing them gratitude for everything they have done. \nEverything in my life has been according to things my mom wanted me to do. My career, my lifestyle, my friends, no dating/ who I date etc. I have never really had a problem with it until I did a few things without her approval. \n1. I got a cat when I was living in my college apartment. She absolutely lost it. This was around COVID and we were all told to evacuate and go back home as classes went online. My mom would not allow me to bring the cat as she was scared of my cat and concerned of what people would say. I ended up having to rehome my sweet boy (my roommate took him) and to this day it\u2019s a heartbreak I will not get over. \n\n2. I wanted to start living on my own after college. That\u2019s when all hell broke loose. She brought up society and how females in my culture don\u2019t live alone. Regardless I stuck with my decision and started living on my own. Well for my mom she still does not approve of it and still brings it up as this could be viewed as a very shameful thing. \n\nIf you have not noticed the pattern yet : my mom cares A LOT about societal opinion.\n\nNow moving on to the current issue. I have saved up enough to buy a home. During college I worked 25-30 hours weekly while being a full time student because I did not want to be financially dependent on my parents. So I have saved up here and there and after starting my full time job last year I have enough to buy a home. \n\nThe issue now is that my mom wants me to purchase a property that is big enough for all of us( me, mom, dad, lil bro). She wants me to pay the mortgage on the home while they pay for utilities. I should also preface that my parents already have a home of their own and their mortgage is $1200. My mortgage would be over $3200 if I got a house as big as she's wanting. She also wants me to pay most of the down payment and she will not sell her house as she plans to just rent it out. \n\nI have told her several times that I DO NOT want to live with her. Like I already help them financially a lot. But I want to have my own property and continue to live on my own. She calls this selfish and emotionally blackmails me as to how family should stay together and how I am a bad daughter. \n\nI feel very very guilty when she tells me these things So am I a selfish asshole?", "created_utc": 1677349211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11brqh2/aita_for_not_wanting_buy_a_house_with_my/", "score": 352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your relationship with yourself will be negatively impacted. \n\nIn our cultures (Asian) filial piety becomes conflated with enmeshed and codependent family dynamics. Boundaries are viewed as bad. \n\nBoundaries are actually good. They protect us so that we don\u2019t develop burning resentment. They protect our relationships with people so we don\u2019t snap and explode at them. \n\nYou are not being a bad daughter. When she says this - your ego will definitely be triggered. Don\u2019t react to this. People are wired to protest change because of old survival instincts. They will threaten and act out as an attempt to stay with what is familiar to them because that is what is safe. That is what your mom is doing. Do not take it personally. \n\nRemember: setting appropriate boundaries so that you can be the healthiest you - is you being a good person. When you can show up as the best version of yourself, you can have a better relationship with your parents rather than doing things out of guilt and feeling anger/resentment. That stuff eats away at people. Parents are flawed and not always right. They have lessons to learn too - among which is when to let go. \n\nAs a child, you did what your mother wanted because you wanted to be valued as a \u201cgood\u201d child. Now as an adult, you have the ability to decide for yourself - do you want your purpose for living to be of value to some as \u201cgood\u201d in order to receive love? <- do you think this is beneficial or detrimental to your well being? \n\nOr are you willing to withstand pushback and grow on a new learning curve so you can do what you know is good for you? \n\n(Receiving love at the cost of self-love or loving yourself and setting boundaries/standards for love you are willing to receive?) \n\n~ all the best", "NTA. Of course, this is from a very American perspective. Your mom may be concerned about what society thinks, but I'd like to point out that here in the US, a woman who excels in school, gets a full ride scholarship, manages to save enough to buy a home on her own at the very young age of 23, and yet can still help support her parents, is looked upon *very* favorably by society. You're what we call a \"winner\". \n\nGet your house, get a cat. Live your life by the American Dream you came to pursue.

I have been here more than half of my life, and you brought us here so that \\[brother\\] and I could have a better life. I intend to have one.\"\n\nI have an old friend who was born and raised here, but whose parents are Indian (Gujarati). The only way they were able to live the life they wanted (no medical school, no arranged marriage, etc.) was to move out and provide for themselves. It was hard at first. The parents were upset for a number of reasons -- because of appearances, like your parents, but also legitimate concern, because their perspective on how involved they should be in their adult children's lives was informed by their culture.\n\nMy friend didn't write them off, or shut them out.

She can't pick and choose, taking only the economic opportunities but keeping you behaving exactly the way you'd have to behave if you were back in her original homeland. \n\nIn this place, in this culture, you have no duty to live with your parents when you're grown, and it's actually expected that you won't. You have a duty to make sure they're all right, and take care of them if you can and they really need it; but the key to this is \"only in the ways that both you can and they really need.\" \n\nIf they have other options for a place to live, you have no duty whatsoever to let them live in your house. If they didn't have other options, but you couldn't do it because it would drive you around the bend, then you *still* wouldn't have a duty to live with them. \n\nIn this case, they own a house, which you said they would consider renting out if you'd allow them to live with you. That means they've got another option for how to live, so you are absolutely free to say no to them.\n\nOf course you feel guilty anyway, though! They've trained you to feel that way, so that they can make you do what they want. You're going to need to be firm anyway. Therapy might be a good tool to help you. \n\nP.S. Get another cat!

Doesn't your mom worry about what people will think knowing their young adult daughter is paying for her parents and brother? Especially when most parents would be helping their kids making the next step in life at your age, not tying them down on purpose. \n\nSo your mom supposedly cares about peoples opinions yet throws away her values when it benefits her.

They have done the bare minimum for you, you don't owe them any more than that.\n\nI would go low contact or no contact for a while, and buy that place without telling them. It's gonna blow up anyway and get ugly if you go through with it, why let them make the whole process difficult? At the end, at least you're gonna have your own door that you can lock with your own key, and decide who comes and goes. And get a cat too, while you're at it. Good luck!", "NTA. And you know it. You\u2019re just here because you\u2019ve been raised on guilt, just as they were and many of us were.

Lol. You don\u2019t want that, do you? Of course you will help them if they truly needed it, it would be all hands on deck! Sometimes parents forget their kids want their own lives.", "NTA I feel like I\u2019m reading someone writing out my origin story, though I admit my parents were not this bad. They gave my cat away and I had no say, they threatened to pull me out of school if I disobeyed even if the disobedience wasn\u2019t actually bad, so much as things they thought their family and friends would be judgmental of.  My whole life seemed to be at the mercy of their whims and their fear of looking bad to the community. So I made it a life goal to be financially independent, to make a life I could be in charge of. I still used to cave from time to time and let them push me around but at least I knew that was my own weakness and not them holding money over my head.\n\nYou need to decide what kind of life you want to live. I know women who went all in, they accepted their parents\u2019 role as the decision makers and lived as they were told to no matter what their professional and financial situation was and then they transferred control to their husband when the time came. I\u2019ll admit, most of them are divorced now but not all - some are genuinely happy.  They have homes with children they love and a strong cultural and religious connection. \n\nThen there\u2019s women like me (much smaller number\u2026). I have my own house, my own car, TWO cats and I do only as I please. I refused to get married though if I meet someone who I cared about, I might change my mind. But I won\u2019t care if my parents don\u2019t approve of a man. I laid down boundaries and enforced them - stop harassing me about rishtas or I won\u2019t pick up the phone anymore and you won\u2019t see me again. I was lucky that it worked. I get to have a mom and a dad and be an aunt to my sister\u2019s children. And I have freedom.  But it\u2019s a very different life. My sister would be so unhappy living the way I do. And I would be miserable in her shoes as a doctor with a traditional husband and two kids with her parents in and out of her house constantly. \n\nSo what is your happiness? If you want that traditional life, things like this aren\u2019t so uncommon. If something like this upsets you and you\u2019d not want to have to do it, maybe you can make a different life for yourself. But it won\u2019t be without sacrifice and you have to be ready to stand up to disapproval.", "NTA.  No no no!   You will live to regret it if you do.

Sibling groups who never lived apart, never got married, and definitely never had kids. Because few accomplished Western-raised people want to date a 45-year-old man who lives with his parents and sisters. \n\nYou can strike a balance. Live close enough together and have family meals during the week, support for future kids, etc. but be able to retire to your own space. Take all the pros of BOTH types of family structured. That\u2019s JMO from experiencing this kind of blended family. They both have amazing things to offer and neither should be entirely dismissed.", "Stop telling them your plans.

Please buy only what you can afford and get yourself a cat. I know so many conservative families where the daughters have moved out on their own \u2014 just not in with a guy. This is so normal for the diaspora", "Simply say no. They've been guilting you your whole life, end it now. NTA", "NTA.

I'm sorry she made you give up your sweet boy, is there any way your old roomie might let you see him every now and again?", "Embrace the dark side- by a house just for you.\n\nYou are caught between two worlds but you are also an adult.

Its moronic to then try and hamstring you with expectations from other cultures.\n\n\nI'm not south asian so I may be wrong, but don't most of these expectations fall on the eldest son and not the eldest child? They shouldn't chop and change cultural expectations to fit their own personal wants.", "NTA Her expectations are completely unreasonable. Rather than feel guilty, break it down to its simplest elements: What she wants will never make you happy. What you want will never make her happy. Those two facts will not change. Only one of you gets to be happy here. You have the choice which one of you gets to be happy in YOUR life. I guarantee that if she were in control of that choice she wouldn't feel a shred of guilt choosing to dedicate your life to HER happiness so you don't have to feel guilty either.", "NTA.

It took many years with me having to put my foot down on occasion, yet also letting them know I appreciated their raising of me, but this is how I live my life. I also researched how I wanted to live my life and raise my own children. I endeavoured to not 'throw the baby out with the bath water' as the saying goes and kept healthy traditions while introducing new methods.

In exchange, you worked very hard and paid for your entire college education. You also saved enough money to pay for your housing. You have followed her directions to life. You gave up your cat. You are now even imo.  \n\nThe only thing I can see there is you lived with them over the pandemic, maybe there's a small thing there but they aren't retired. Your mom literally wants to loot you. She wants you, in your early 20s, to buy a house for four people while they rent out and profit from their house and only pay utilities. You're not going to be able to maintain that life. $3200/month mortgage means you have to get and keep a job that earns at least $120K a year. \n\nThe agreement is you help them later, not pay for everything for 30 to 40 years. Your mom is 54! She doesn't get to demand a house of her choosing. \n\n>The issue now is that my mom wants me to purchase a property that is big enough for all of us( me, mom, dad, lil bro). \n\nBut they already have a house big enough for all of you? If they asked you to chip into their current mortgage I could possibly see that but they didn't pay for your education so that's usually what prompts the exchange. The idea being they spend XX to fund your education so in exchange you spend XX to help them later. \n\nTbh maybe just point out you're female so this isn't on you. You are supposed to get married and leave the family. She can't have it both ways where she takes everything from you like your previous culture (although that's not accurate either) while pushing this on a female (which is more western culture.)\n\nFemales in your culture don't live alone but don't they also tend to be taken care of and not pay for an entire house?", "NTA. \n\nNever live with her again.

Live with that.\n\nLove your life, continue supporting yourself, you made yourself as small and convenient as possible and they keep wanting to take more.  It maybe a cultural norm but it\u2019s no way to live.  Stop the financial support.  Find a chosen family, find a partner you love or choose.  You\u2019ve done everything on your own continue doing so.", "As a child of an immigrant, what in the crazy shit hell bat shit nonsense is this. You're 23.

It applies to more than just parents. :)", "How does she think \"society\" will view her mooching off her daughter by forcing her entire family into a house her daughter is paying the mortgage for?  I bet she and your father would insist their names be put on the deed for their huge future investment of utility bills so they could claim you're living with THEM.  Don't do this.  Don't give them a key.  Don't let them spend the night, and watch your mail.  Go low contact.  Your mother only cares about the aspects of her culture that bring her what she wants.  She's dumping the inconvenient ones.  But be ready to shut her down if she brings up marriage..."]}
