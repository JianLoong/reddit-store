A few years ago, I was undecided on whether I was going to stay in the state  I went to college or move back to my home city. My parents  wanted me to 'come home,' so they offered instead of me going and renting in a different state, getting a job they didn't approve of- that they'd help me buy a place. I was hesitant to move back because my family is fairly toxic, but it seemed really financially stupid not to take the opportunity so I agreed to move home and we started looking. \n\nI found a place that I loved, and my parents generously provided the down payment and cosigned so I could get a very low interest rate. In the \\~2 years I lived there, I paid all bills, all mortgage, repairs, etc. etc. Furnishing, all that. It really felt like *my* home. They stressed that I should view it as their gift to me and not to feel obligated to pay them back for the down payment, that it was mine. They did threaten to 'take it away' as a manipulation tactic but I just brushed it off. Like for example...my mom didn't think I deserved a house because I only mopped once a week and not every day. During the covid boom, my neighbors started selling off their homes at a profit and I mentioned it to my parents. They pushed me to sell, and said that I could make a profit on the sale, move in with them, then spend the money on another place in the future. I realize how stupid I was to say yes considering I know how poorly living with my family goes, but again I tried to favor logic over emotions. They presented it to me as \"*You* can sell *your* house\" and how this great investment would pay off for me and I could find an even better place later with the money.\n\nWe ended up selling the home at a profit of \\~80k. Immediately after the sale, they took the money and no more was said. I honestly didn't feel I deserved the profit, since I didn't pay the down payment- but while I lived there I put in around 30k in mortgage payments alone. I asked for my equity- as in, only the money that I myself put in, and they refused. They said that if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have had a house to put money into and that I'm not entitled to the money. So....now I'm stuck. I was pouring my money into this place, thinking that I was paying to own instead of throwing away on rent, investing in my future, and now I'm right back where I started. I am going to move out and rent a place, but I'm honestly really upset that they did this to me- it's like I was just a pawn in a property investment for them. They've tried to use the money as a bargaining chip (if you do x and y, then might give it to you) but I'm really not interested in being manipulated even further in my mid 20s. I want to push and ask for my money so I can try and find a new place to actually own, but at this point I don't know if I'm being ungrateful or entitled, or if I'm being reasonable, or if it's even worth it.

Usually it's transferred directly to the seller's bank account. So wither the profit was legally theirs because of the deed, or you simply let them access money that was not theirs. How exactly did they end up in possession of the money? INFO", "Dude, they STOLE your money. That was your house, you paid the bills, you maintained the property. Yes, you should offer to pay them back for the down payment even if they did say it was a gift, JUST so that they couldn't continue to hold it over you that they paid that. But they were not owed that money and they definitely were not owed the entirety of the sale of your house. That \"you only have x because of us\" is a weak-ass argument. Litteraly ANYTHING in your entire life can be boiled down to \"you wouldn't have x if not for us\", because they can simplify it to \"we made you therefore you only exist because of us, therefore you owe us everything you have\". It's garbage. Don't buy into that filth.\n\nAlso, HOW did they take the money? Why did they have acess to this money? Who's name was on the title of the house? You MIGHT have a legal case against them and I would HIGHLY reccomend you take legal action if possible. It is not OK for them to litteraly steal your house sale.", "You said in the comments that you have shares in their company totaling around 60K...and that they're trying to get you to sign them over? \n\nlol, do they think you're that stupid? Sell the shares, go back to your college town or somewhere else far away, and buy yourself a place. Maybe they'll learn it's not the nicest thing in the world to cheat their kids.", "NTA. Your parents cosigned for a house for you. You say they've always been really toxic to you so, immediately, terrible choice. All three of you were on the title? Also terrible choice. If it was to be your house, it should have been in only your name. Beyond that, when you decided to sell, how did your parents get the money anyway? There would have been a setup for what bank account everything was going into, and I'm curious why it was deposited into anyones other than yours.\n\nYour parents used you to flip a house. That's why they wanted you to clean it daily, pour your money into customizing it... that may not have been their *original* intent, but the minute there was a possibility of decent profit, that's what they turned it into. I'm inclined to think they always intended to force you to buy them out or sell it.\n\nYou need to get a lawyer, if you haven't already. Just because you agreed to a sale doesn't mean you forfeited your 1/3 ownership, and should be compensated as such. There might be some sort of limit on how long you have to file, so I definitely suggest *immediately* as opposed to waiting.", "Umm, OP you need a lawyer badly, there\u2019s a word to describe your parents, and I\u2019m actually going to say it right here. Your parents are so self-centred they cannot accept that you are living on your own, it kind of feels like like control, they want to manipulate you into doing what they want, I think you should follow a couple simple steps.\n\nStep 1: get a lawyer, if your parents are willing to steal from their own child, what else are they willing to do? You paid 30K, which means legally, morally, ethically, that money is yours, as long as your name is on the deed your parents can\u2019t take that away from you, so yeah, get a lawyer, get paid, and run like hell.\n\nStep 2: freeze your credit, you need to make sure that your mom and dad haven\u2019t opened any outstanding credit card bills in your name.\n\nStep 3: find an apartment that you can call your own, the reason why I say you get an apartment is so that your parents can\u2019t manipulate you or hold the apartment over your head.\n\nStep 4: don\u2019t agree to anything your parents offer you, apply this old saying \u201cif it\u2019s too good to be true, it usually is\u201d\n\nNTA, honestly your parents kind of sound like narcissists, I would also recommend you check out r/legaladvice, which actively has lawyers watching, to sum all of this up, this is financial abuse.\n\nOh, and finally, Step 5: go \u201cNo Contact\u201d with your parents.", "NTA But you need a real estate lawyer, not Reddit. If your name was on the deed and you can show you've been making the payments legally at least part of that money is yours", "Tell them to either give you the excess profit above the down payment they lent you aloe you will be contacting a lawyer. And then I would have very limited contact with your parents. They sound very manipulative and narcissistic. They stole from you.", "NTA. They took advantage of you bigtime. I would talk to a lawyer to see what your options are, they definitely did you very dirty.", "I'm sorry they ran this game on you. Truly. That's not your fault. But their past behavior is a really good indicator of their future behaviors. So, pay attention to your instincts now.\n\nThey cosigned so some of the proceeds from sale are rightfully theirs. Its their property too, it seems?\n\nIn your excitement over what they offer, you forget that what they want most is control? That's what it costs you every time they proposition you and you believe things will work in your favor and they will be more hands off. They won't. They trap you with their help, IMO. If your name was on the deed, how did the check go to your parents in the first place?\n\nNTA. You are being viciously manipulated and not even greatly compensated for remaining close and putting up with all the knee jerk nonsense. I think you should run like hell or sue them for your half of the proceeds and then run like hell. (And sue the bank if they wrongly issued the check from the sale only to your parents.)\n\nJust because our parents \"love\" us, doesn't mean they treat us right or even fairly.", "NTA. But dude, stop taking \u201cfavors\u201d from your parents. You said it was about logic not emotions, but you said they were toxic before, they bribed you into coming to your home town, they treated you like shit while you were in the house, they wouldn\u2019t let you pay back the down payment because they knew they could hold it over you, and then they stole the money from the sale. \n\nAt this point, them screwing you over IS the logical conclusion. \n\nTalk to a lawyer, see if you can get the money back and then go far far away from them and never connect your finances or decision making to them ever again.", "NTA, your parents are HUGE AHs.\n\n\nFirst if all, im pretty sure your name was on the deed, making it yours. Even if their name was also on the deed, they cant bar you from your home for ANY reason\n\n\nNext, as someone stated, the money should go i to the sellers account. Fine. But you asked for 30k back, and they basicly told you to fuck off. Yeah... id get a lawyer", "NTA - You\u2019ll probably want to see a lawyer. You should get your money back. If they think the effort of signing paperwork is worth an additional 30k on top of the 50k, they really are terrible people.", "NTA. You co-signed on the loan, and paid the mortgage and bills. Tell them you will be suing them. You should be able to get an amount equal to the ratio of the amount you have paid in and their portion. Could even argue that they called it a gift and it is all yours", "So at the end of the day,\n\nYour parents bought a house, you rented the house from them, they sold the house. It is their money. \n\nIt really sucks and they absolutely manipulated you. But you weren\u2019t paying putting equity into YOUR home, you were just a tenant.", "ESH\n\n> We ended up selling the home at a profit of ~80k.\n\nThat hardly seems worth it?\n\n>  I was just a pawn in a property investment for them.\n\nWell *you* could have just kept *your* house.\n\n> I realize how stupid I was to say yes considering I know how poorly living with my family goes, but again I tried to favor logic over emotions.\n\nI don't see anything logical about this, either.\n\nThis whole situation was *ridiculous*, and you would be wise to stop letting your parents and their money dictate the path your life takes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have access to my parents bank accounts since I'm the eldest (I have never once touched any of their money, it's solely in case something happens to them) and I noticed that the money had been taken out. I asked about it out of concern that maybe someone had stolen it, and he told me he moved all of it to an investment (or something? I'm not incredibly familiar with financials etc.) so that he could earn more money for retirement. To add more info, they're about to sell off their company for a **LOT** of money. As in, eight figures. So it's not like they're hurting financially and need my equity to survive. They gave me very small equity in that company in fact when I was born and they're currently trying to get me to sign over my shares back to them before the sale because they don't feel I 'deserve' them.

A lawyer will easily cost several thousand dollars, and your parents will likely be well-positioned to argue that, e.g., they actually didn't turn much of a profit (all sorts of house and transactional \"expenses\" will likely pop up) and that the equity value of your mortgage payments should be offset by factors including their down payment, the lower interest rate you paid, and the fact that you lived in the house. It's quite possible that actually using a lawyer means an upside of a few thousand bucks at best, against the potential downside of seriously pissing you parents off.

It the court agrees, your parents also have to pay for your lawyer as a rule.\n\nThat's a lot of money to leave on the table. Thirty grand is a nice portion towards a down payment of your own.", "It\u2019s perfectly fair to say I am tired of you guys manipulating me and if you continue to do so, I will contact with you, I want to come to a fair agreement and so therefore I expect half of this money to mine or I will retain the lawyer", "When you move out, without their help, so they can't find you.

They dangled a house in front of you to keep their control over you. \n\nThey sold the house, again, to keep control over you.\n\nIt sounds like it's time to get to the heart of the matter -- that you can't trust toxic people because they will ruin your life.\n\nYou almost got away from them by going to college somewhere else, you  almost got away from them by living separately. Now is the time to commit to this, to put yourself first, and to stop believing their lies. They care about controlling you.\n\nNTA But please stop believing these people, and get away for real.", "NTA.\n\nI'd take them to court to get my share back.

Hopefully you can get your money back, although I strongly suspect it will rtke lawyers and/or police to do so. Afterwards... go ahead and cut them out your life. I can't imagine wanting to ever meet them again.", "What was the logic for selling? The cost will just be higher in the future so no real gain. This is really strange. Was the house in your name?

The only logic that should apply to them is how could they screw me in this situation & how to prevent it? They've probably trained you since you were a kid that they're always right, know more than you, & will get their way with you. You're going to have to break that mental/emotional habit too. Do not take their word for anything. Assume that what they say is BS. Always seek detailed outside information for anything involving them.

They aren't/haven't only abused ppl in your name/interests: Your parents are abusing you. They're doing it financially, mentally, emotionally, isolation, etc. It isn't okay. It isn't loving and you don't deserve how they're treating you. I'm  sorry you're in this position. Your deserve much better and better people in your life. Sometimes those better people aren't family members. Protect yourself with lawyers & other professionals. Keep working towards your escape. Seek professional mental/emotional support.

But really it\u2019s probably call it lessons learned and only be polite but distant.\n\nThey showed you that they don\u2019t care about you at all.
