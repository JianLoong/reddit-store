We\u2019ve known each other for quite some time now, as we met in high school. I will admit that back then, at least during the first year or two of high school, I wasn\u2019t exactly nice to her, but I have since owned up to that.\n\nWe became better friends in college and during our last year of it, she started developing feelings for me. I know this because around this point, she became very nice to me and would seemingly always find reasons to be around me. Her friends also point-blank told me that she liked me and that I should make a move. Since I was pretty busy at this point in my life, I never did. Instead, she asked me out a few times. Given that I was so busy, I had declined most of her offers.\n\nSince graduating, we have begun seeing each other and became a couple around 3 months ago. She\u2019s been ecstatic about this and basically tells me every day how happy she is with this. But recently, I think she's starting to have second thoughts.\n\nLast weekend, several of my friends were in town, so I decided to hang out with them. She really wanted us to hang out on that particular weekend for some time now (since we\u2019d both have time off from work), but when I explained that my friends were coming, she said that it was alright if I spent time with them instead of her.\n\nI did, but since then she seems to have become distant and a bit cold. Yesterday, while I was at work, she came by my apartment. When I got back, she was cooking something, and I could tell that she had tidied the place up a bit.\n\nI tried chatting with her a bit, but she\u2019d only give short answers and seemed upset. I asked her if anything was bothering her, and she told me that this relationship was nothing like how she had imagined and that I was being very self-centered because I didn't hang out with her last weekend. She also said that overall, I seemed much more focused on myself versus us (I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means).\n\nI got a little defensive and (probably stupidly) reminded her that she was the one who pursued me. She looked surprised at this and said that was irrelevant now. I then jokingly added that maybe instead of being upset, she should feel privileged that she got herself to the point where she could cook for me.\n\nShe got really upset with this and started grabbing her things. I told her to stay so that we could talk, but she refused and left. I have not texted her since, as I think she would like some space. This morning I got a text from one of her friends just saying \"Wow you're dumb\".\n\nAITA?\n\nMore context: For those wondering, I did try to show affection when she was complaining. I tried to hug and kiss her but she moved away from me and said it was belittling.

And she is very over that nonsense, and not going to put up with it much longer. She expected that once you were together, that you would value her as a partner.
