My boyfriend (30m) proposed and it was one of the best experiences of my life, we are also expecting our first baby in December. The proposal was cute and in our apartment. I already had brunch plans with my friends so I went to brunch around 10 am, and then immediately went to my moms house to tell her.  I thought it would be a cute idea for me to not immediately say I was engaged and hope she spotted the ring and then I could surprise her.  \n\nAbout 10 mins at her house she noticed the ring and asked me if I was engaged and I happily told her yes.  She said \u201cis it real? Are  you sure it\u2019s not cubic zirconia?\u201d I said no, and asked if she wanted to see it. She didn\u2019t want to see it, and asked me if his parents knew. That\u2019s when I informed her that at dinner with his parents the night before, while I was in the bathroom he quickly mentioned that he was going to propose soon. \n\nMind you, this was an impromptu dinner because they originally called earlier to see if they can visit our new apartment and then we ended up going to dinner. As soon as my mother heard they he \u201cexplicitly\u201d told his parents that he was proposing while at dinner, she told me that it was disrespectful that he didn\u2019t alert her either. Even though, he discussed proposing to me months ago with my mom at another dinner. She also said that he knows I don\u2019t have a Dad( he left) and she took this as the ultimate disrespect. \n\nNot only did my fianc\u00e9 mention proposing to me at dinner earlier this summer, but I told my mom when we were looking at rings, and that I thought he was proposing soon about a month ago. I also asked her if she felt it was important for him to ask/ officially discuss it with her a few months ago and she said no he didn\u2019t have to. However, she is now telling me that he should\u2019ve texted/ called or said something to let her know. She feels as though respect was given to his parents and not to mine because they were told closer to when it was happening, and she was told over the summer. \n\nI can understand if she were blindsided and had no idea, while his parents knew the entire time but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I\u2019m 8 months pregnant, my baby shower is in a week and this worrying me because we all have to attend this baby shower and I don\u2019t want there to be animosity.

Why does she feel entitled to this info? This has nothing to do with her.", "NTA. While she may have said she didn't want him to ask permission, she obviously didn't mean it. It sounds like the only reason he told his parents was because it was the day before he was going to and maybe he was really excited-that's an exciting event! Your mom is taking this way to personally. It literally has ZERO to do with her. If I were you, I'd set a hard boundary right now that if she can't move past this, then there will be consequences. \n\nCongrats on the engagement and baby!", "NTA, obviously.  And your fiance isn't either.  I don't at all get where your mom is coming from.  Sure, his parents got to know in advance and she didn't, but HE was the one who was planning the proposal, and they're HIS parents.  Could he have told her?  Sure, I guess.  But she wasn't at the dinner when the opportunity arose.  And it's not like she needed to know for any reason - in fact, if there was even a little bit of a surprise for you, there's reason NOT to tell her - she might spoil it.\n\nI would completely ignore this tantrum.  Laugh about it with your fiance and do nothing whatsoever.  Let your mom pout if she wants.  \n\nI have a feeling, no matter how this went down she'd find a way to be offended because she likes using being offended as a way to be the center of attention.  Like - if she said \"ooh I'm jealous, I wish I had known this was about to happen!\" - fair.  But to go from there to saying that she was \"disrespected\" - outrageous.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is keeping score and is being an AH with her comments about the ring.  She's  looking for trouble and finding it under your rock.\n\nYour bf mentioned it to his parents because they just happened to be there.  He did not go seek them out to tell them and intentionally keep your mom in the dark.  Nobody was hiding it from your mom.  She needs to grow up and realize she is not going to always be number one on the phone tree call list.", "NTA\nMay I suggest keeping the wedding plans from mummy dearest. It sounds like she's got a jealous streak and she could make things very difficult with the wedding planning.\nYour engagement should have been a time of happiness and your mother is making it all about her. Time to adult and tell her you won't accept this behavior forward. She said she didn't think it was important to ask, so it stands to reason she wouldn't think it was important for him to tell her either. Don't let her ruin this good time in your life. It's possible she's just feeling like ye are growing apart because you are having a baby and you got engaged but it really seems like jealousy from this post. If you see signs at the baby shower that your mother is grabbing for attention then you definitely need to back away from her.", "NTA - you mom is a little old school it seems but she really should just be happy for you.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on your engagement. \n\nNeither you or your fianc\u00e9e did anything wrong. Hopefully your mother will get over feeling left out and focus on the more important aspects of your new and growing family.", "NTA.  It sounds like it has been just you and your mom for a long time.  It s probably an adjustment for her to share you, not with your fianc\u00e9 but with his parents.  If this is not normal behavior for her, just give her some space for a few days.  My guess is with the baby shower and then a new grandchild, she will stop focusing as much on you.", "NTA\n\nShe's letting her jealousy get in the way of your joy\n\nHas she even congratulated you?

Obvi neither you or fianc\u00e9 or your soon-to-be in-laws are the assholes here. Your mom should be excited out of her gourd right now and I\u2019m so sad she isn\u2019t. She should be jumping up and down with you and listening to you dream about your day. She needs to be a mom. She\u2019s not. She\u2019s made this about herself instead of you and your sweet guy.
