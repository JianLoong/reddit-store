In that group is her boyfriend from college, a Muslim guy she's known for a couple years. He seems like a nice guy, and I've got no problem with them, though our parents are kinda pricks about it. But I do know Muslims need halal food, so I drove an hour thirty to a specialty place that can get me some halal chicken to make in the food.\n\nCome the day of the potluck, I show up with my gumbo, and it's the hit it usually is. He won't give it a shot and says it's not halal. I showed him the receipt from the place, even did a run down on the ingredients, and no dice. I dropped it and let the rest of the evening run its course, and we had a pretty good time.\n\nThis morning my sister asked if I was upset he didn't have any, and I was honest with her. It's not my business what a man puts in his body, but I did my research, and made sure every part of that gumbo fits their diet. If he doesn't like gumbo he doesn't like gumbo, I'd just rather him shoot straight with me and tell me outright he doesn't wanna have any instead of saying it's because of the religion thing. In the moment I kinda felt like he thought I was trying to trick him.\n\nShe said she understood, but two of our mutual friends think I was trying to make him eat something he didn't wanna. I'm not an expert on the Muslim thing, but I really did do my research, and I asked a lot of questions at the specialty place to make sure I got it right.

You went to a lot of trouble to make a nice gumbo for your sister's BF. Ultimately he didn't want any. Hard to know if he was passively accusing you of trying to trick him or whether maybe it's more culturally polite for him to say that rather than, 'gumbo gives me explosive gas.' Who knows? You tried to do something nice, didn't work out. That's all.", "NAH. You tried to accommodate for him and put in a lot of effort. That\u2019s nice. It would have been nice if he thanked you for that.\n\nHe didn\u2019t feel comfortable eating the dish. That\u2019s his choice. You can feel hurt, but you can\u2019t force feed him. And you didn\u2019t.", "NTA.", "NAH. God (Allah) save us from well-meaning cooks. I\u2019ve had people serve me food that made me sick saying things like, \u201cYou said you\u2019re allergic to dairy, not butter! I specifically made it with no milk just for you!\u201d My diabetic sister ended up in the hospital when someone told her they got her sugar-free coffee syrup, not realizing that corn syrup is sugar, not vegetables. This guy has probably been burned before, like \u201cIt\u2019s not pork, it\u2019s just bacon!\u201d Don\u2019t take it personally.", "NAH. You were very considerate in making food that he could eat. It's hard for Muslims to trust the food non-Muslims make though because of hidden ingredients that non-Muslims may not pay attention to. My husband is Muslim and while he doesn't care if the food is halal or not doesn't even trust McDonalds to not put bacon on food and will check out his burgers thoroughly before eating. And the amount of people who don't know that things like bacon and ham  are pork is insane. Then there is gelatine which is in so many things and more often than not pork based. \n\nAgain, were very considerate and I'm sorry he declined. If he ever comes to a dinner again you would never steer wrong by making a pork free meal and ever better to be as halal as you can. It's very respectful. Just remember that he can decline the food too. Someday he may feel more comfortable", "I wouldn't necessarily say your an AH, but you should respect his choice not to eat. Religious reasons or not, food is something that many people are picky about and it doesn't necessarily mean it is a personal diss to your cooking abilities. I have no special diet, but I have a hard time accepting food from others which I fully realize it is silly... Potlucks make me cringe and I'm that person that goes for the prepackaged garbage over the delicious home made stuff and it is totally psychological. You may have been insulted, but he probably felt bad for declining your food too. Sometimes you just have to be okay with not agreeing and just don't make a big deal about it.", "YTA\n\nHe didn't think you are trying to trick him or anything. People with dietary restrictions are in general more careful. Halal food is more than just the meat. Its about surface, how it's cooked, utensils. It's an entire thing. He has the right to deny it. \n\nAnd if you love to cook you need to accept not everyone wants to try your food. Or give it a try. They don't have to. It's there. Whoever wants to eat, they can eat. No need to make it a deal. He didn't insult you. And it wasn't even about you. It was about the meal. And even if you did everything properly he has the right to not trust you because he has that right. It has nothing to do with YOU", "NTA, and given the rampant Islamophobia in the world, I guess it's not surprising that he doesn't trust relative strangers, AND gumbo frequently includes pork sausages, so I guess he'd be nervous.\n\nHopefully you'll gain his trust: you seem like your heart's in the right place.", "As someone who only eats kosher food, I can definitely understand. \n\nThere\u2019s all sorts of variables here that you probably aren\u2019t aware of other than the ingredients - in fact , there would literally be no way for me to be able to eat it, unfortunately. In addition, the straight explanation could definitely be insulting, so i would do everything in my power to avoid giving the real reason.\n\nNo one should blame you for being upset, especially after all that effort. As long as you weren\u2019t being overly pushy and accepted the no, NAH.\n\nI would recommend seeing if your sister can give you an idea of what his actual restrictions are if this situation comes up again - it\u2019s not impossible that there could be a workaround, but honestly they might prefer you didn\u2019t go to the extra trouble - I know I would", "NAH...you went to a lot of trouble, and feel upset that it was not recognized. He is wary of unknowingly eating something: it takes time to build trust, and he knows how hard it is to eat halal...someone new to cooking halal can trip up so easily. \n\nKeep trying. Make sure your sister and he know how hard you are trying. Even if he doesn't like the food you cook, it is the thought that counts.", "NAH, you tried.  It's odd he didn't believe you, and disappointing he didn't try it, but, actually I don't think this rises to AH level.  People try stuff at parties or they don't; most hosts hope they will.", "NTA. Some people are more uptight.", "Yeah, dude, YTA. First, if someone doesn't want to eat, forcing them to eat is a bad move regardless of whether they are keeping a special diet or not. Second, while the chicken you picked up was halal, what about the stock, the thickener, the spice mix? There might have been an ingredient there that was NOT halal. Third, lots of really observant people actually insist that the food is cooked by someone who is Muslim for it to properly count as halal, regardless of the ingredients. So yes, his observance practices are not for you to judge on.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I don't eat non veg food from stranger non Muslims. It's not personal I just want to be sure what I eat is permissible. You say it's halal, that you've done research ok but how does he know that? Was there any other meat in it? You know it's zabiha? Also isn't gumbo normally made with shellfish? You know he follows a school of though that finds that permissible?  You checked every stock or seasoning or thickener you used for gelatine?At the end of the day he doesn't know you very well, doesn't know if you know/ care about what he can and can't eat. It's not that he's accusing you of lying just that he doesn't know weather everything used was halal. Don't take it like an insult and make a big deal about it", "YTA - \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence. No one owes you justification or a reasoning for saying so. In addition, just because he said no doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t appreciate the effort, however, pressing the issue obviously had diminishing returns. This is a lesson in respecting someone\u2019s boundaries.", "YTA.\n\nI've been vegetarian and also vegan for a few years, and people were frequently confused about what was considered either vegetarian or vegan. It didn't bother me too much because it's not like I'm allergic to anything or have religious beliefs around it, but it's different with the BF.\n\nHe has very strict rules and he can't afford to screw them up because it's very important to him. Your ego doesn't have a place here and if he doesn't feel comfortable with you cooking for him then you have to accept that. He will likely only eat food from people he trusts to cook halal food and accept it from nobody else.", "Yeah YTA. \n\nWhy should this man trust you with his spiritual wellbeing, because you said so. No. Back up.\n\nMaybe next time dont make gumbo, which was specifically created to hide questionable meat.", "NTA and hope you learned the lesson to not try to do extra for people who don't care or who are not worthy of your effort.", "NTA, I understand he may be sceptical but it would have been more reasonable of him to have an open discussion rather than assume he wouldn't be able to eat it. \nIf you'd kicked up a fuss on the night, then this would be different, but you were asked out right and were honest with your answer. I see you providing the receipt and explaining your research as a normal response, not one trying to get him to eat it, as you're addressing the issue he has not just spewing some bull.", "NTA because he was basically accusing you of lying about it being Halal.  Maybe he can't take a chance but it would have been better of him to say that instead of insisting it wasn't halal when he didn't know that.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t push the matter because at the end of the day he has the right to choose what he does or doesn\u2019t eat. It\u2019s clear you know that, so you\u2019re definitely in the clear.\n\nI would have gone with NAH, except the boyfriend comes off like a bit of an AH when he insists the dish isn\u2019t halal even though you\u2019ve done the research and put in the time and effort to accommodate him. Of course, \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence and he doesn\u2019t have to just justify his dietary choices to you, but when you\u2019ve clearly gone to great lengths to make sure the dish is suitable, the least he could do is at least honestly explain either why it\u2019s not halal so you can get it right next time (or spare yourself the effort), or give you the honest truth about why he won\u2019t try it even if it is halal.\n\nI don\u2019t think this has to be super serious. Maybe have a private conversation with him later to see what exactly the issue was? If he truly thinks the dish wasn\u2019t halal, maybe he can explain where you went wrong so you know for the future. Maybe there\u2019s another reason he was reluctant - you said your parents haven\u2019t responded well to his religion; maybe he\u2019s doubtful that you truly are and was extra wary that you might be tricking him. Another factor may be that it sounds like other people were there too - maybe he didn\u2019t want to explain his hesitance in front of lots of people, or it\u2019s someone else at the potluck that he didn\u2019t trust.", "NTA. You made sure it was halal. Assuming you're correct that it was, he's either lying about why he doesn't want to try it, or he thinks you're lying about what's in it. Both are concerning.", "YTA. I have food allergies and even when people make the best attempt they can get it wrong. Lots of food products don\u2019t list pork as a specific ingredient. He\u2019s allowed to turn down food for religious reasons, even if you don\u2019t believe him.", "NTA you're allowed to be upset. It's not like you made a rude remark to him or anything. Everyone saying you were trying to force him to eat is weirding me out. You didnt say \"He has to eat it or I wont like him\" you were mildly disappointed when you tried really hard to be accommodating. You're allowed to have emotions, ffs", "Sorry, but you\u2019re kinda YTA here. Halal is more than the ingredients. It\u2019s nice what you tried to do, but it likely wouldn\u2019t have confirmed with strict Halal guidelines. Just let it go.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people with super high dietary requirements/ choices go to events like potlucks.", "There may be other dietary restrictions he doesn't necessarily feel like getting into as well.", "Siding with the NAH vote. You're not an asshole for feeling hurt. He's not an asshole for refusing.", "NTA. I\u2019d be offended too. Especially after you went to such lengths to make sure it was okay for him to eat. People tend to be over the top with religious dietary restrictions. It can be a bit silly at times.", "YTA, someone didn\u2019t try your gumbo? Nothing wrong with it. Grow up", "YTA, just leave him alone, he doesn't want to eat it", "YYA.\n\n> It's not my business what a man puts in his body,\n\n>. If he doesn't like gumbo he doesn't like gumbo, I'd just rather him shoot straight with me and tell me outright he doesn't wanna have any instead of saying it's because of the religion thing.\n\nHe gave you his reasoning \n\n>He won't give it a shot and says it's not halal. \nYou did not accept it. \n\n\n\n>I'm fine if he just didn't wanna have any,\n\nHe DID NOT want any and you did not accept it.\n\n>In the moment I kinda felt like he thought I was trying to trick him.\n\nHe could have had experience where a restaurant, store or butchery tried to pass off food as halal and it wasn't.\n\nLook what you did was considerate but you should have rather run it by them. The \"religious thing\" is very important to Muslims and they can respect it how they like.\n\nAlso after doing ALL that effort and he rejected the food cause he didn't like gumbo would you realy be more okay with that? I highly doubt it. I feel this man was in a lose lose situation.\n\nWith all that being said, you made a huge deal out of this.

On the other hand, he knows more about it, obviously, so it's certainly possible that you missed something and he really just couldn't eat it.  Did he explain exactly how it wasn't Halal?", "YTA. The vast majority of gumbo recipes contain something not halal whether it's bacon, seafood, sausage etc. There are literally too many ingredients to parse out so it's way easier to simply not eat if it's made by people who have zero experience making halal food.\n\nIf you wanted to be nice, you could have gone to a specialty shop and gotten a halal dish, instead of being so arrogant you think a 30 minute Google search means you're an expert.", "I knew about the how it's cooked part, I didn't know it had anything to do with utensils.

And that's a veeeeery big assumption here. Yes, the chicken was halal, what about the rest of the ingredients? If some of them had gelatin, like gumbo thickener often does, it makes the whole dish non-halal regardless of the status of the chicken. And OP most likely didn't check.", "Community? Friendship?

Guy said no again and OP dropped it. You honestly sound like the child here.", "The surprise  probably didn't help either. He probably came with a plan, either to bring his own food to eat or to stick with veg food. You tried to do a nice thing and it didn't work and its normal you'd feel a bit upset at that but taking it as a insult when if really wasn't isn't right. Maybe if you'd talked to him, asked him the questions you asked at the shop then he would have been more sure about the fact you were making sure the food Is halal", "I would honestly try talking to him before the party next time, so you can address his concerns without a bunch of people complicating the issue. That way, if there is a part of it you missed, he can fill you in.", "Surprise him with a veggie dish next time to make sure he will eat it. No need to walk on the thin line since he feels uncomfortable.", "I have a Jewish friend who keeps kosher (she\u2019s explained some of it but I can\u2019t reliably tell you what that means) and she has two refrigerators to keep things separated.

It's possible he wasn't able to eat your food despite your best efforts, and maybe he just didn't want to go into whatever religious dietary reason (could be as simple as not knowing if you followed every rule, or just that your kitchen itself isn't halal enough). Or it could be that he wasn't eating for another reason, or he doesn't like gumbo... It literally doesn't matter. It's his choice what he eats and you have to respect it.\n\nMoving forward, I would suggest having a conversation and asking what you can do to make food that will be acceptable for him.

If I made a mistake along the way that's on me, but I triple checked everything with google and the lady.", "The receipt plus the guy asking about gumbo ingredients would certainly have been enough to resolve that.", "Just so you know halal is less strict than kosher. The reason your firend has two refrigerators is because for food to be kosher meat and dairy have to be kep separate and there can be no contamination, that restriction dose not exists in Islam. We can have zabiha halal meat and dairy together. It's still very complicated but in that respect it is less than ksoher. Of course we don't have alcohol or alcohol derived products so in that way it's slightly more strict but fairy is more common than alcohol", "Oh I agree fully but I also think that there\u2019s been opportunity for both parties to talk post party to talk about why the food wasn\u2019t ok for the boyfriend - in any event it given this is unlikely to be the last event  that the boyfriend attends and that OP a conversation between both on the actualities of cooking for someone who is Muslim would benefit both", "This is why people shouldn\u2019t do nice things for others.

The chicken?vA receipt also dosent show all the ingredients and just because the chicken is halal dosnet mean the dish is necessarily", "Yeah, well, he can't know for sure how thorough you were, if you cleansed all of the utensils before cooking, if you used a new cutting board, et.c.", "The mistake might be on you but the sin (for lack of better term) would be all his", "You made so much of an effort and he still refused to even try it.

Wasn't for this particular gumbo but the handle on my other one popped off and burned the hell out of me so I had to get a new one anyway. All it touched was dish soap.  \nI don't know how I could've done anything different with the cookware.  \nI don't think I was pushy, but maybe it came off that way? I hope not.

OP I would\u2019ve too appreciated your thoughtfulness and would\u2019ve had it too.", "what.", "Wow! None of the Muslim I know had an issue with extracts in baking, so it's interesting to learn that some teachings do.", "Muslims can eat the same as a vegetarian would without issue, the halal requirement for food only applies to meat other than fish. Since the gumbo had meat in it, I can understand him being wary. \n\nIt's likely that the potluck had vegetarian dishes, or dishes with fish in them.", "I could understand if he asked you to do all this & then he said I'm not having any, but sounds like you decided to do this all on your own. That's kinda on you.", "Exactly though you didn\u2019t know everything and if he ate that it wouldn\u2019t have been halal. They take it very seriously.   Yta if you still hold a grudge, I\u2019d have a chat with him and say no hard feelings", "OP was feeling insulted because someone didn\u2019t try their food - that is childish. His Reasons doesn\u2019t matter.", "Pots, and cutting boards too?", "Aw, man, that's sweet AND sad! Sounds like you have a good group there, though, and I'm glad you had the option, just in case.", "OP was under the impression that they were friends.  He drove an hour and a half to buy a halal chicken.  And the young man refused to trust and accept his hospitality which is a significant aspect of islamic culture.  I have eaten parts of sheep cows and goats I didn't even realize we're edible to show appreciation for my hosts hospitality and I never regretted it because I was raised to accept hospitality and offer it in return if I could.  Refusing bread and salt is indeed an insult.", "Thinking that if someone refuses to eat your food is an insult to you is problematic. It has nothing to do with OP. At all. \n\nI would never eat something that I don't want to eat just because of the hosts feelings. If you are willing to host people for food you need to accept that not everyone will eat the same way you eat. Not everyone grew up eating a lambs eyes. And if my hosts loves it that is up to them. I don't have to eat it because the host likes it otherwise he will be offended. You don't put things inside your body just because someone can't take no for an answer.", "Once anything (pot, pan, spoon, fork) has touched anything non halal or non kosher it becomes unclean.  For example, you can not eat gumbo that was made in a pot that ever had pork in it.\n\nThat is a very basic way to think of it.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to not even try to cook for my kosher friends; it\u2019s just easier to let them cook.", "The fact the post made it here shows that OP does believe the gumbo is halal, and the boyfriend believes it is not. If they had gone through all of the ingredients in a discussion, rather than simply OP showing the receipt, then they wouldn't have this disagreement. Something being halal is not up for debate or opinion, if the boyfriend said a specific ingredient is not halal, then OP has to accept he made a mistake. Or, if it truly was halal, but the boyfriend wasn't certain about it, he'd have surely been more polite or clear in saying 'It may be halal, but I can't know for sure, so I can't eat it, but I appreciate the effort you went through to try accommodating me'.\n\nThe fact that they still have their total disagreement can only come down to a lack of communication, which means OP, who was clearly interested in communicating, is NTA. And while the boyfriend is free to not eat the gumbo, OP is entitled to acknowledgement of his effort he went through in trying to make it halal. So if there was acknowledgement of OP's effort, then I'd agree OP is TA for still being upset over it after an apology or more respectful rejection.", "NAH, you gave it an honest effort and didn't try to force anything on anyone.", "YTA bc yes, you went to a lot of effort for his sake, but you\u2019re still the asshole bc you NEEDED validation for it. If someone politely turns down food, and you try to win an intellectual argument against them to convince them to eat it, and they still politely turn it down a second time, just drop it and get over yourself", "NAH\n\nMaybe next time you can reach out ahead of time and say \"hey, I want to make something halal so that you can partake if you want. Can you give me the guidelines you need to follow so I don't miss anything?\" This way he knows you are serious, isn't caught off guard, and can maybe comment if there is certain food he doesn't care for before you put in the effort.", "N T A\n\nI'm saying this as a Muslim, I'd never eat food that is not halal either. But I would also never use my religion to say no to something, using religion like that is frowned upon too, he'd get smack for it if another Muslim was there. And if someone went out of their way to make halal food just for me I'd try it even if it isn't a dish I don't particularly like, that's just basic decency.\n\nEdit: Some others made good points on why he might not have eaten like maybe he just can't be sure, that would actually make sense. In a case of uncertainty & doubt, I'll also stick to being safe so I'm changing to NAH. Tbh there's no way to know what was really on his mind lol\n\nI think making this a surprise was a mistake, it should've been discussed beforehand.", "NTA. Are people nuts? You went to so much effort and he didn\u2019t even have the curtesy to say no. He just said \u201cit\u2019s not halal\u201d. Freaking hell. You showed the receipt and that was a perfect opportunity to elaborate if his diet is more strict, but instead of elaborating he just simply said \u201cno thanks\u201d. That\u2019s pretty rude of him.", "NTA. Next time, serve him some yummy noodlely appendages.", "all of this!! i had a friend bring me sorbet, and after i had a bite she clarified that it was actually sherbet \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab i had to take a benadryl & call it a day. ppl such as op mean well!! but when you have any dietary restrictions i\u2019ve found that pretty much the only food you can trust is the food that you cook :)", "This, as a Muslim woman myself this boyfriend\u2019s behavior is bizarre. It\u2019s like when halal food in Europe is found in\u2026casinos (true story).", "In the future *ask* and *communicate* before going so above and beyond trying to accommodate someone that clearly does not want you to try to accommodate him in that way.", "i\u2019m Muslim, and i\u2019ve literally never heard of this\ud83d\ude2d i\u2019ve used vanilla extract my entire life and now i\u2019m kinda freaking out that it had alcohol in it this entire time???\n\nETA: okay nevermind it\u2019s all good, apparently it is still halal because the alcohol has no effect on the vanilla and does not make you intoxicated :)", "It's not that confusing.", "Extracts use alcohol to pull the flavours out of the original material since they can get the flavour compounds that are not water soluble. \n\nWhen considering something like vanilla extract you're not using a very large amount, and the baking process is also evaporating most of the alcohol. From the reading I've done tonight, very few Muslims consider it Haram since the prohibition is actually against the sin of intoxication, something harmful to the body and mind. It is essentially impossible to experience any effects of alcohol when using an extract; similarly there are no prohibitions against vinegars or yeast bread which naturally have a very small alcohol component. In addition perfumes that use alcohol are not forbidden either.\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/177030/is-vanilla-extract-halal", "Also there's real vanilla and then there's \"vanilla flavor\", which is a lot cheaper and I don't think it contains alcohol (but please double-check). They taste basically the same, so many people actually use vanilla flavor in baking.", "thank you for this explanation about how it works! i was pretty sure the prohibition was more against intoxication/deliberately impairing (??) the body & mind. it is very interesting that some still consider it haram, but then again that\u2019s just how different ppl choose to interpret things.", "oh, interesting! i\u2019ll have to look into this for the future.", "I never attempted to give him no for an answer.  I honored my host as he honored me, and believe me, I didn't grow up eating lamb's eyes. Disabuse yourself of the notion that it had nothing to do with 0P. it had everything to do with him being an infidel."]}
