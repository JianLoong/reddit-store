I dropped it and let the rest of the evening run its course, and we had a pretty good time.\n\nThis morning my sister asked if I was upset he didn't have any, and I was honest with her. It's not my business what a man puts in his body, but I did my research, and made sure every part of that gumbo fits their diet.

You went to a lot of trouble to make a nice gumbo for your sister's BF. Ultimately he didn't want any. Hard to know if he was passively accusing you of trying to trick him or whether maybe it's more culturally polite for him to say that rather than, 'gumbo gives me explosive gas.' Who knows? You tried to do something nice, didn't work out. That's all.", "NAH. You tried to accommodate for him and put in a lot of effort. That\u2019s nice. It would have been nice if he thanked you for that.\n\nHe didn\u2019t feel comfortable eating the dish. That\u2019s his choice. You can feel hurt, but you can\u2019t force feed him. And you didn\u2019t.", "NTA.", "NAH. God (Allah) save us from well-meaning cooks. I\u2019ve had people serve me food that made me sick saying things like, \u201cYou said you\u2019re allergic to dairy, not butter! I specifically made it with no milk just for you!\u201d My diabetic sister ended up in the hospital when someone told her they got her sugar-free coffee syrup, not realizing that corn syrup is sugar, not vegetables. This guy has probably been burned before, like \u201cIt\u2019s not pork, it\u2019s just bacon!\u201d Don\u2019t take it personally.", "NAH. You were very considerate in making food that he could eat. It's hard for Muslims to trust the food non-Muslims make though because of hidden ingredients that non-Muslims may not pay attention to. My husband is Muslim and while he doesn't care if the food is halal or not doesn't even trust McDonalds to not put bacon on food and will check out his burgers thoroughly before eating. And the amount of people who don't know that things like bacon and ham  are pork is insane. Then there is gelatine which is in so many things and more often than not pork based. \n\nAgain, were very considerate and I'm sorry he declined. If he ever comes to a dinner again you would never steer wrong by making a pork free meal and ever better to be as halal as you can. It's very respectful. Just remember that he can decline the food too. Someday he may feel more comfortable", "I wouldn't necessarily say your an AH, but you should respect his choice not to eat. Religious reasons or not, food is something that many people are picky about and it doesn't necessarily mean it is a personal diss to your cooking abilities. I have no special diet, but I have a hard time accepting food from others which I fully realize it is silly... Potlucks make me cringe and I'm that person that goes for the prepackaged garbage over the delicious home made stuff and it is totally psychological. You may have been insulted, but he probably felt bad for declining your food too. Sometimes you just have to be okay with not agreeing and just don't make a big deal about it.", "YTA\n\nHe didn't think you are trying to trick him or anything. People with dietary restrictions are in general more careful. Halal food is more than just the meat. Its about surface, how it's cooked, utensils. It's an entire thing. He has the right to deny it. \n\nAnd if you love to cook you need to accept not everyone wants to try your food. Or give it a try. They don't have to. It's there. Whoever wants to eat, they can eat. No need to make it a deal. He didn't insult you. And it wasn't even about you. It was about the meal. And even if you did everything properly he has the right to not trust you because he has that right. It has nothing to do with YOU", "NTA, and given the rampant Islamophobia in the world, I guess it's not surprising that he doesn't trust relative strangers, AND gumbo frequently includes pork sausages, so I guess he'd be nervous.\n\nHopefully you'll gain his trust: you seem like your heart's in the right place.", "As someone who only eats kosher food, I can definitely understand. \n\nThere\u2019s all sorts of variables here that you probably aren\u2019t aware of other than the ingredients - in fact , there would literally be no way for me to be able to eat it, unfortunately. In addition, the straight explanation could definitely be insulting, so i would do everything in my power to avoid giving the real reason.\n\nNo one should blame you for being upset, especially after all that effort. As long as you weren\u2019t being overly pushy and accepted the no, NAH.\n\nI would recommend seeing if your sister can give you an idea of what his actual restrictions are if this situation comes up again - it\u2019s not impossible that there could be a workaround, but honestly they might prefer you didn\u2019t go to the extra trouble - I know I would", "NAH...you went to a lot of trouble, and feel upset that it was not recognized. He is wary of unknowingly eating something: it takes time to build trust, and he knows how hard it is to eat halal...someone new to cooking halal can trip up so easily. \n\nKeep trying. Make sure your sister and he know how hard you are trying. Even if he doesn't like the food you cook, it is the thought that counts.", "NAH, you tried.  It's odd he didn't believe you, and disappointing he didn't try it, but, actually I don't think this rises to AH level.  People try stuff at parties or they don't; most hosts hope they will.", "NTA. Some people are more uptight.", "Yeah, dude, YTA. First, if someone doesn't want to eat, forcing them to eat is a bad move regardless of whether they are keeping a special diet or not. Second, while the chicken you picked up was halal, what about the stock, the thickener, the spice mix? There might have been an ingredient there that was NOT halal. Third, lots of really observant people actually insist that the food is cooked by someone who is Muslim for it to properly count as halal, regardless of the ingredients. So yes, his observance practices are not for you to judge on.", "NAH It was a pot luck no one has to try every dish. Maybe he just doesn't like gumbo. I don't.", "YTA. I don't eat non veg food from stranger non Muslims. It's not personal I just want to be sure what I eat is permissible. You say it's halal, that you've done research ok but how does he know that? Was there any other meat in it? You know it's zabiha? Also isn't gumbo normally made with shellfish? You know he follows a school of though that finds that permissible?  You checked every stock or seasoning or thickener you used for gelatine?At the end of the day he doesn't know you very well, doesn't know if you know/ care about what he can and can't eat. It's not that he's accusing you of lying just that he doesn't know weather everything used was halal. Don't take it like an insult and make a big deal about it", "YTA - \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence. No one owes you justification or a reasoning for saying so. In addition, just because he said no doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t appreciate the effort, however, pressing the issue obviously had diminishing returns. This is a lesson in respecting someone\u2019s boundaries.", "YTA.\n\nI've been vegetarian and also vegan for a few years, and people were frequently confused about what was considered either vegetarian or vegan. It didn't bother me too much because it's not like I'm allergic to anything or have religious beliefs around it, but it's different with the BF.\n\nHe has very strict rules and he can't afford to screw them up because it's very important to him. Your ego doesn't have a place here and if he doesn't feel comfortable with you cooking for him then you have to accept that. He will likely only eat food from people he trusts to cook halal food and accept it from nobody else.", "Yeah YTA. \n\nWhy should this man trust you with his spiritual wellbeing, because you said so. No. Back up.\n\nMaybe next time dont make gumbo, which was specifically created to hide questionable meat.", "NTA and hope you learned the lesson to not try to do extra for people who don't care or who are not worthy of your effort.", "NTA, I understand he may be sceptical but it would have been more reasonable of him to have an open discussion rather than assume he wouldn't be able to eat it. \nIf you'd kicked up a fuss on the night, then this would be different, but you were asked out right and were honest with your answer. I see you providing the receipt and explaining your research as a normal response, not one trying to get him to eat it, as you're addressing the issue he has not just spewing some bull.", "NTA because he was basically accusing you of lying about it being Halal.  Maybe he can't take a chance but it would have been better of him to say that instead of insisting it wasn't halal when he didn't know that.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t push the matter because at the end of the day he has the right to choose what he does or doesn\u2019t eat. It\u2019s clear you know that, so you\u2019re definitely in the clear.\n\nI would have gone with NAH, except the boyfriend comes off like a bit of an AH when he insists the dish isn\u2019t halal even though you\u2019ve done the research and put in the time and effort to accommodate him. Of course, \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence and he doesn\u2019t have to just justify his dietary choices to you, but when you\u2019ve clearly gone to great lengths to make sure the dish is suitable, the least he could do is at least honestly explain either why it\u2019s not halal so you can get it right next time (or spare yourself the effort), or give you the honest truth about why he won\u2019t try it even if it is halal.\n\nI don\u2019t think this has to be super serious. Maybe have a private conversation with him later to see what exactly the issue was? If he truly thinks the dish wasn\u2019t halal, maybe he can explain where you went wrong so you know for the future. Maybe there\u2019s another reason he was reluctant - you said your parents haven\u2019t responded well to his religion; maybe he\u2019s doubtful that you truly are and was extra wary that you might be tricking him. Another factor may be that it sounds like other people were there too - maybe he didn\u2019t want to explain his hesitance in front of lots of people, or it\u2019s someone else at the potluck that he didn\u2019t trust.", "NTA. You made sure it was halal. Assuming you're correct that it was, he's either lying about why he doesn't want to try it, or he thinks you're lying about what's in it. Both are concerning.", "YTA. I have food allergies and even when people make the best attempt they can get it wrong. Lots of food products don\u2019t list pork as a specific ingredient. He\u2019s allowed to turn down food for religious reasons, even if you don\u2019t believe him.", "NTA you're allowed to be upset. It's not like you made a rude remark to him or anything. Everyone saying you were trying to force him to eat is weirding me out. You didnt say \"He has to eat it or I wont like him\" you were mildly disappointed when you tried really hard to be accommodating. You're allowed to have emotions, ffs", "Sorry, but you\u2019re kinda YTA here. Halal is more than the ingredients. It\u2019s nice what you tried to do, but it likely wouldn\u2019t have confirmed with strict Halal guidelines. Just let it go.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people with super high dietary requirements/ choices go to events like potlucks.", "There may be other dietary restrictions he doesn't necessarily feel like getting into as well.", "Siding with the NAH vote. You're not an asshole for feeling hurt. He's not an asshole for refusing.", "NTA. I\u2019d be offended too. Especially after you went to such lengths to make sure it was okay for him to eat. People tend to be over the top with religious dietary restrictions. It can be a bit silly at times.", "YTA, someone didn\u2019t try your gumbo? Nothing wrong with it. Grow up", "YTA, just leave him alone, he doesn't want to eat it", "YYA.\n\n> It's not my business what a man puts in his body,\n\n>. If he doesn't like gumbo he doesn't like gumbo, I'd just rather him shoot straight with me and tell me outright he doesn't wanna have any instead of saying it's because of the religion thing.\n\nHe gave you his reasoning \n\n>He won't give it a shot and says it's not halal. \nYou did not accept it. \n\n\n\n>I'm fine if he just didn't wanna have any,\n\nHe DID NOT want any and you did not accept it.\n\n>In the moment I kinda felt like he thought I was trying to trick him.\n\nHe could have had experience where a restaurant, store or butchery tried to pass off food as halal and it wasn't.\n\nLook what you did was considerate but you should have rather run it by them. The \"religious thing\" is very important to Muslims and they can respect it how they like.\n\nAlso after doing ALL that effort and he rejected the food cause he didn't like gumbo would you realy be more okay with that? I highly doubt it. I feel this man was in a lose lose situation.\n\nWith all that being said, you made a huge deal out of this. You would rather feel better if he rejected on you terms.\n\nMajor AH.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You tried really hard and I totally understand being disappointed that he wouldn't even try it.  On the other hand, he knows more about it, obviously, so it's certainly possible that you missed something and he really just couldn't eat it.  Did he explain exactly how it wasn't Halal?", "YTA. The vast majority of gumbo recipes contain something not halal whether it's bacon, seafood, sausage etc. There are literally too many ingredients to parse out so it's way easier to simply not eat if it's made by people who have zero experience making halal food.\n\nIf you wanted to be nice, you could have gone to a specialty shop and gotten a halal dish, instead of being so arrogant you think a 30 minute Google search means you're an expert.", "I knew about the how it's cooked part, I didn't know it had anything to do with utensils.

You say \"assuming you're right\", maybe he doesn't know OP well enough to make that assumption", "That's the thing, assuming the OP was correct about it being halal. And that's a veeeeery big assumption here. Yes, the chicken was halal, what about the rest of the ingredients? If some of them had gelatin, like gumbo thickener often does, it makes the whole dish non-halal regardless of the status of the chicken. And OP most likely didn't check.", "Community? Friendship?

YTA for not accepting no.", "How does that make him TA? Guy said it wasn't halal because of the chicken. OP pointed out the chicken and other ingredients are halal. Guy said no again and OP dropped it. You honestly sound like the child here.", "The surprise  probably didn't help either. He probably came with a plan, either to bring his own food to eat or to stick with veg food. You tried to do a nice thing and it didn't work and its normal you'd feel a bit upset at that but taking it as a insult when if really wasn't isn't right. Maybe if you'd talked to him, asked him the questions you asked at the shop then he would have been more sure about the fact you were making sure the food Is halal", "I would honestly try talking to him before the party next time, so you can address his concerns without a bunch of people complicating the issue. That way, if there is a part of it you missed, he can fill you in.", "Surprise him with a veggie dish next time to make sure he will eat it. No need to walk on the thin line since he feels uncomfortable.", "I have a Jewish friend who keeps kosher (she\u2019s explained some of it but I can\u2019t reliably tell you what that means) and she has two refrigerators to keep things separated.

And I understand that you feel deflated that he wouldn't try it. But this comes down very simply to him having autonomy over what he eats. It's possible he wasn't able to eat your food despite your best efforts, and maybe he just didn't want to go into whatever religious dietary reason (could be as simple as not knowing if you followed every rule, or just that your kitchen itself isn't halal enough). Or it could be that he wasn't eating for another reason, or he doesn't like gumbo... It literally doesn't matter. It's his choice what he eats and you have to respect it.\n\nMoving forward, I would suggest having a conversation and asking what you can do to make food that will be acceptable for him. Let him know your intentions so there's no surprise. \n\nAnd I will happily eat your Gumbo if there's any going :)", "It may be that OP didn't do anything wrong but that the Muslim couldn't know this randomly at a party.

I do wish he had been more gracious and acknowledged your efforts.", "Yeah, I def wouldn't go about changing your whole religion and worldview just so that he would try your gumbo.", "Alternatively he used the \u201cit\u2019s not halal\u201d excuse\nto things he doesn\u2019t want to try and not hurt people\u2019s feelings.

If I made a mistake along the way that's on me, but I triple checked everything with google and the lady.", "The receipt plus the guy asking about gumbo ingredients would certainly have been enough to resolve that.", "Just so you know halal is less strict than kosher. The reason your firend has two refrigerators is because for food to be kosher meat and dairy have to be kep separate and there can be no contamination, that restriction dose not exists in Islam. We can have zabiha halal meat and dairy together. It's still very complicated but in that respect it is less than ksoher. Of course we don't have alcohol or alcohol derived products so in that way it's slightly more strict but fairy is more common than alcohol", "Oh I agree fully but I also think that there\u2019s been opportunity for both parties to talk post party to talk about why the food wasn\u2019t ok for the boyfriend - in any event it given this is unlikely to be the last event  that the boyfriend attends and that OP a conversation between both on the actualities of cooking for someone who is Muslim would benefit both", "This is why people shouldn\u2019t do nice things for others.

Either way you cut it he was quite rude.", "She cared cuz she put in a lot of extra effort to make it \"safe\" for him. Halal meat is more expensive and she had to go to a specialist.

The chicken?vA receipt also dosent show all the ingredients and just because the chicken is halal dosnet mean the dish is necessarily", "Yeah, well, he can't know for sure how thorough you were, if you cleansed all of the utensils before cooking, if you used a new cutting board, et.c.", "The mistake might be on you but the sin (for lack of better term) would be all his", "You made so much of an effort and he still refused to even try it.

Wasn't for this particular gumbo but the handle on my other one popped off and burned the hell out of me so I had to get a new one anyway. All it touched was dish soap.  \nI don't know how I could've done anything different with the cookware.  \nI don't think I was pushy, but maybe it came off that way? I hope not.
