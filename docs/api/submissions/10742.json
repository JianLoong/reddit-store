My mom doesn't think they should sit in the sink for longer than a minute and I don't think it matters if they sit in the sink for about a day. For context, I am 18 years old and a full-time college student with a part-time job. (not a basement dweller)\n\nThe problem now is that my mom has made a new rule: if there is a dish in the sink and she washes it, we have to pay her 5 dollars. I don't take this rule too seriously, as I usually leave whatever dishes I have in my room and wash them in the morning before I go to class. But last night, I had a couple of friends over and they put their dishes in the sink before we went to bed. I woke up with a 5 under the fruit basket and my mom told me she took it out of my cash stash because she washed my friend's dishes this morning.\n\nI'm pretty peeved about this. I'm upset that she took anything out of my cash jar, and also that she is really taking this rule seriously. We got into the basic argument, \"Don't touch my stuff\", and \"wash your dishes\". But Am I Really the Asshole about this? Is this a typical parenting tactic or am I being an annoying teenager?\n\nObviously, my parents think I'm being an ass and so does one of my friends that was over last night. But my other friend said my Mom is being crazy and that she is weirded out by this rule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I was told to add, I CANNOT do dishes at night. Mom's a light sleeper and she wakes up early for work so she asked me to not do any dishes after she is in bed. I don't know if it is important but she goes to bed around 8 and wakes up around 4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I talked to my mom. She came in and told me she feels bad because she knows she just was being petty. She said she didn't have the intention of keeping the money but when I argued about it this morning, she got mad and held her ground about it. I did apologize and just asked for her to be more communicative with me when she is upset with something I'm doing. (this is a new problem). I still will be just keeping any more dirty dishes in my bathroom if it is overnight or if I simply don't have time before class. But the comments do make me realize I should be better about making it a habit to wash them immediately.

Clean up after yourself and don't hoard dishes in your room, that's disgusting too.", "Sorry pal YTA here. If it helps I\u2019ve also been this AH before. This is one of those things that is a \u201cmy house my rules\u201d type thing with parents. Some of those rules are ridiculous, like as an adult living at home, things OUTSIDE of the home shouldn\u2019t really fall into this category. As for cleaning and things like that, My House My Rules, is kinda king. \n\nPersonally, when I was dorming and had roommates we were pretty on the same page about dishes getting done, but it\u2019s something that varies person to person and communication with the person you\u2019re living with is a part of that. My first two roommates were mostly \u201cclean it right away\u201d people, however we were only roommates, not really friends outside of that, so we\u2019d wash our own dishes when we got to it but within reason. Like as busy as I was going to class and working, (also not a basement dweller), I still would feel bad leaving my dishes in the sink for more than a couple days (and that\u2019s like rinsed and sitting to soak at LEAST). My third roommate was a friend so I could be a bit more lax, however she was WAY more lax than me and would leave dishes all the time. Plus we shared dishes so it was harder to be like \u201cokay I\u2019ll just leave hers for her to wash\u201d. So then I was like okay this IS pretty annoying.\n\nLiving back at home afterwards, I didn\u2019t want to be complacent so typically I leave my dishes in my own space until I\u2019m going to clean them because I know if I put them in the sink to wait, someone else will clean them. Which isn\u2019t really fair. My parents like an empty sink at LEAST by nighttime but pretty much throughout the day. In fact at this point when I put my dishes there, and say i have a couple other things to do before i get to washing them, or they require soaking, and income back and they\u2019re done? I actually get annoyed. Sure it\u2019s nice I didn\u2019t have to wash the dish but I\u2019m an adult and trying to have self discipline and be responsible for myself regardless of being an adult child living in my parent\u2019s home. I don\u2019t want to be enabled. \n\nAnd honestly I wish they\u2019d implement the rule your mom has bc my also adult sibling living at home (older than me), is the MOST complacent person you\u2019ve ever met. Leaves dishes wherever, in his bedroom or just anywhere really. He\u2019ll cook a meal, leave the mess, and then even after eating not go back and clean it. He\u2019ll do it at bedtime and then if not called on it just go to sleep and wake up to a clean kitchen and sink. It drives me nuts bc he is enabled and it\u2019s like \u2026.grow tf up. It\u2019s certainly not fair to my parents and they\u2019re pissed about it too but enable it rather than dealing with leaving a mess where he makes it. Like truly they\u2019d be balling out if they implemented the same rule, not from my dishes but from his. \n\nAlso worth noting, maybe if you spoke to your mom and explained, then she\u2019s dress that you approaching it like an adult. I\u2019m going to write verbatim, what kind of convo I would have with mine if I was in your shoes\n\n \u201chey mom, I totally get why you implemented that rule and it\u2019s fair. Even though I may disagree with the sink being empty 24/7 or washing immediately after, it\u2019s the sink in YOUR house so I get why you would implement that rule. Typically I adhere to it by keeping my dishes in my own space until I am ready to clean them, even if it isn\u2019t straight after I\u2019m done eating. I\u2019ve been sticking to doing that and abiding by your rules, and really wish that you had approached me about my friends\u2019 dishes. I weren\u2019t aware that they were there, and would be happy to clean them too as they are my guests, but didn\u2019t have the chance to because you go to them first. I\u2019m wondering if we can come to a compromise about that for the future bc despite the rule you set, that i respect, I feel like it crossed a line/boundary of mine, for you to go into my money and take it. Even when we\u2019re written a ticket, the onus of responsibility falls on the ticketed person to pay up. The rule is don\u2019t go over 50mph, a cop doesn\u2019t pull you over and take the fine out of your wallet. I really would have appreciated it if you could have instead asked me for it, and then this convo would\u2019ve happened more organically, while also feeling like my space is respected even though I\u2019m your adult child living under your roof. I get that you don\u2019t want to have to call me every time there\u2019s a dish in the sink to get me to do it, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s at least one of the points of your rule, however if it\u2019s my guest\u2019s dishes, I\u2019m wondering if you could give me some courtesy time where you leave the dishes I\u2019m responsible for to the side until company leaves and I\u2019m able to get to it? Maybe as a compromise during that time, whatever dishes you put in the sink during that time, I\u2019ll also take responsibility for and wash while I clean the rest from my friends.\u201d", "This is clearly the product of years of slobbery.

Not sure how this was emotional manipulation, but if it is, OP should be encouraged to move out and set firm boundaries.", "Guilting people is emotional manipulation.", "I mean, OP\u2019s mom admitted she was putting him in an impossible situation by insisting that there be no dishes in the sink when she wakes up, but also not allowing him to wash dishes after 8pm.\n\nUnless I\u2019m misremembering, I believe OP said that they do all their dishes (and whatever dishes are in the sink) in the morning before they leave for class.\n\nSo OP IS doing their dishes, and doing plenty of other chores around the house.\n\nI think it\u2019s silly to say that just because OP disagrees with a new rule that they should move out, especially when that doesn\u2019t seem to be what anyone wants.\n\nThere\u2019s such a thing as conflict resolution, which it sounds like OP has already engaged in to solve this tiff. And let\u2019s get real - it IS a tiff, not the HUGE DEAL a lot of people are making it out to be."]}
