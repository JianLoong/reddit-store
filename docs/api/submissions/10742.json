My mom doesn't think they should sit in the sink for longer than a minute and I don't think it matters if they sit in the sink for about a day. For context, I am 18 years old and a full-time college student with a part-time job. (not a basement dweller)\n\nThe problem now is that my mom has made a new rule: if there is a dish in the sink and she washes it, we have to pay her 5 dollars. I don't take this rule too seriously, as I usually leave whatever dishes I have in my room and wash them in the morning before I go to class. But last night, I had a couple of friends over and they put their dishes in the sink before we went to bed. I woke up with a 5 under the fruit basket and my mom told me she took it out of my cash stash because she washed my friend's dishes this morning.\n\nI'm pretty peeved about this. I'm upset that she took anything out of my cash jar, and also that she is really taking this rule seriously. We got into the basic argument, \"Don't touch my stuff\", and \"wash your dishes\". But Am I Really the Asshole about this? Is this a typical parenting tactic or am I being an annoying teenager?\n\nObviously, my parents think I'm being an ass and so does one of my friends that was over last night. But my other friend said my Mom is being crazy and that she is weirded out by this rule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I was told to add, I CANNOT do dishes at night. Mom's a light sleeper and she wakes up early for work so she asked me to not do any dishes after she is in bed. I don't know if it is important but she goes to bed around 8 and wakes up around 4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I talked to my mom. She came in and told me she feels bad because she knows she just was being petty. She said she didn't have the intention of keeping the money but when I argued about it this morning, she got mad and held her ground about it. I did apologize and just asked for her to be more communicative with me when she is upset with something I'm doing. (this is a new problem). I still will be just keeping any more dirty dishes in my bathroom if it is overnight or if I simply don't have time before class. But the comments do make me realize I should be better about making it a habit to wash them immediately.

Clean up after yourself and don't hoard dishes in your room, that's disgusting too.", "Sorry pal YTA here. If it helps I\u2019ve also been this AH before. This is one of those things that is a \u201cmy house my rules\u201d type thing with parents. Some of those rules are ridiculous, like as an adult living at home, things OUTSIDE of the home shouldn\u2019t really fall into this category. As for cleaning and things like that, My House My Rules, is kinda king. \n\nPersonally, when I was dorming and had roommates we were pretty on the same page about dishes getting done, but it\u2019s something that varies person to person and communication with the person you\u2019re living with is a part of that. My first two roommates were mostly \u201cclean it right away\u201d people, however we were only roommates, not really friends outside of that, so we\u2019d wash our own dishes when we got to it but within reason. Like as busy as I was going to class and working, (also not a basement dweller), I still would feel bad leaving my dishes in the sink for more than a couple days (and that\u2019s like rinsed and sitting to soak at LEAST). My third roommate was a friend so I could be a bit more lax, however she was WAY more lax than me and would leave dishes all the time. Plus we shared dishes so it was harder to be like \u201cokay I\u2019ll just leave hers for her to wash\u201d. So then I was like okay this IS pretty annoying.\n\nLiving back at home afterwards, I didn\u2019t want to be complacent so typically I leave my dishes in my own space until I\u2019m going to clean them because I know if I put them in the sink to wait, someone else will clean them. Which isn\u2019t really fair. My parents like an empty sink at LEAST by nighttime but pretty much throughout the day. In fact at this point when I put my dishes there, and say i have a couple other things to do before i get to washing them, or they require soaking, and income back and they\u2019re done? I actually get annoyed. Sure it\u2019s nice I didn\u2019t have to wash the dish but I\u2019m an adult and trying to have self discipline and be responsible for myself regardless of being an adult child living in my parent\u2019s home. I don\u2019t want to be enabled. \n\nAnd honestly I wish they\u2019d implement the rule your mom has bc my also adult sibling living at home (older than me), is the MOST complacent person you\u2019ve ever met. Leaves dishes wherever, in his bedroom or just anywhere really. He\u2019ll cook a meal, leave the mess, and then even after eating not go back and clean it. He\u2019ll do it at bedtime and then if not called on it just go to sleep and wake up to a clean kitchen and sink. It drives me nuts bc he is enabled and it\u2019s like \u2026.grow tf up. It\u2019s certainly not fair to my parents and they\u2019re pissed about it too but enable it rather than dealing with leaving a mess where he makes it. Like truly they\u2019d be balling out if they implemented the same rule, not from my dishes but from his. \n\nAlso worth noting, maybe if you spoke to your mom and explained, then she\u2019s dress that you approaching it like an adult. I\u2019m going to write verbatim, what kind of convo I would have with mine if I was in your shoes\n\n \u201chey mom, I totally get why you implemented that rule and it\u2019s fair. Even though I may disagree with the sink being empty 24/7 or washing immediately after, it\u2019s the sink in YOUR house so I get why you would implement that rule. Typically I adhere to it by keeping my dishes in my own space until I am ready to clean them, even if it isn\u2019t straight after I\u2019m done eating. I\u2019ve been sticking to doing that and abiding by your rules, and really wish that you had approached me about my friends\u2019 dishes. I weren\u2019t aware that they were there, and would be happy to clean them too as they are my guests, but didn\u2019t have the chance to because you go to them first. I\u2019m wondering if we can come to a compromise about that for the future bc despite the rule you set, that i respect, I feel like it crossed a line/boundary of mine, for you to go into my money and take it. Even when we\u2019re written a ticket, the onus of responsibility falls on the ticketed person to pay up. The rule is don\u2019t go over 50mph, a cop doesn\u2019t pull you over and take the fine out of your wallet. I really would have appreciated it if you could have instead asked me for it, and then this convo would\u2019ve happened more organically, while also feeling like my space is respected even though I\u2019m your adult child living under your roof. I get that you don\u2019t want to have to call me every time there\u2019s a dish in the sink to get me to do it, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s at least one of the points of your rule, however if it\u2019s my guest\u2019s dishes, I\u2019m wondering if you could give me some courtesy time where you leave the dishes I\u2019m responsible for to the side until company leaves and I\u2019m able to get to it? Maybe as a compromise during that time, whatever dishes you put in the sink during that time, I\u2019ll also take responsibility for and wash while I clean the rest from my friends.\u201d", "This is clearly the product of years of slobbery.

Some of ya\u2019ll were really never loved by your parents", "Please don't take advice from internet strangers who barely know you to heart", "YTA, and wtf eweww \" keeping your dishes in the bathroom tf is wrong with you.", "NTA she's being ridiculous.", "NTA. Mom could have asked for the money in the morning, but going into your stash was wrong. Seems like you solved it OP, so no one is the asshole here.\n\n Keep the lines of communication open, and actual ask her if the idea of you moving out in the future means she will miss you. It's time for you all to be honest with each other.", "You're 18, so you should be cleaning up after yourself.  However, you said that your mother is a light sleeper and goes to bed at 8pm and gets up at 4am - demanding that you don't clean dishes after 8pm.  This rule is incompatible with her \"$5 per dish in the sink\" rule, especially if you have friends around.  On the other hand, your mother doesn't want you to move out.  I think your mother is the AH here, you're NTA.\n\nIt does sound like your mother is overly controlling and you are probably ready to move out.\n\nBTW Have you got a dishwasher? You could just put dishes in the dishwasher and your mother could turn it on when she gets up.\n\nI have a suggestion which may be useful when your friends come over: use disposable plates, cups, etc.  No cleaning required, you and your friends bin them as they leave.", "Nta. Also cash jar? Use a bank weirdo. \n\nDon\u2019t let them fester, but it\u2019s fine to not clean immediately", "NTA\n\nWow to all the people voting TA (before the edit). I\u2019m 39 with a full time job and my partner and I regularly leave dishes in the sink for more than a minute simply because we are tired at the end of the day and also like to save up a load instead of washing a glass or cup the moment we\u2019ve taken the past sip.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear the dad\u2019s perspective. Does mum split the dishes according to who used them and he does his own? Does she charge him as well as I\u2019ll assume they share their income? \n\nAlso, get a dishwasher!", "NTA\nYour mom is a control freak. Dishes can stay in the sink for an hour or two. No big deal. \n\nI never understood the issue people have with having a clean sink before bed. It\u2019s dishes. They can be done in the morning. As long as you put water on them so they don\u2019t get crusty. \n\n$5 seems petty.", "He's just 18 WTF are you takking about moving from home? Not everyone turns into rich people on their 18's birthday", "How messy are you to think leaving a plate unwashed overnight causes sudden infestation and mold? Grow up man lol", "Until I got dishwasher I left them in the sink and usually cleaned in bulk.", ">I've offered to move out\n\nAfter 18, it's \"I'm moving out\", when you're ready to do so. \n\nThough you'll need to work out if you can afford to do so vs the downsides of living at home. Living with parents is usually a big, big saving over living with friends/in your own place. But if your parents are not nice, it's worth the tradeoffs. If this is your biggest beef, it's not the worst. If your parents are constantly limiting your freedoms and being manipulative then moving out may be more appropriate if possible. \n\n(I had a mum who was a frequent pain in the ass and had stuff to say on just about everything. If I wasn't getting married after uni, I would have probably moved out sooner...).", ">my mom says it is a waste of money.\n\nBecause for the sake of washing some damn dishes it is a waste of money. It takes 1 minute to do.... JFC stop being so lazy.", "So clean up your dishes.  Tell mom if she doesn\u2019t want you to wash them at night and risk waking her, there must. Be a reprieve on $5 penalty \nShe must chose the dirty dishes in the morning or the running water at night", "I think it's unreadonable. Of course, the dishes can't wait to the next day like OP thinks. But it also doesn't has to be done immediately. If you're coming home after a long day at work or school it's fine to rest 30 minutes after dinner before doing the dishes.", "Comments like this are ridiculous - OP isn\u2019t not cleaning up after themselves, they\u2019re doing the dishes later when they have time since their mother doesn\u2019t want them to wash dishes at night.\n\nLike there is no indication that OP isn\u2019t cleaning up, just that they\u2019re not cleaning up immediately (which is pretty normal, at least in my household).", "It's not weird, it's just not what you're used to. You underestimate the desire for independence that exists in young Americans. It wouldn't wreck the relationship and it would get OP out from under the mother's rules. OP says themselves it is an option for them. Unless they want to do that then they are going to accept house rules, which includes washing dishes.", "You sir are a proper person", "Yeah, but they're eventually washing them in the kitchen. A solution might be for the OP to give them a wash in their bathroom sink, and then again in the kitchen. Just closet the toilet lid before you flush, it spews droplets into the air if you don't!", "A lot of people here only like this sub because they get a license to rip people apart. I mean, I love watching an abusive spouse or deranged roommate get a reality check once in a while. But the hostility here over such a small thing? Reddit moment.", "utterly untrue", "I think i love you!! That caught me so off guard i choked on smoke lmmfao. Your a genius though and this is the perfect compromise.", "Or, get the Dawn spray bottle. It is great! Just spray the detergent on and and wash under the running water. It is great if you only have a couple of items to wash. I live alone and got one recently. Instead of collecting enough dirty dishes to fill the sink, I wash them straight away and keep my kitchen clean.\n\nAt 18 you are old enough to take care of your own mess and not leave it for your mother.", "This is still something he isn\u2019t allowed to do after 8pm\u2026which if there are dirty dishes made after 8pm and they are still sitting there at 4am when mum wakes, op gets in to trouble, but op also gets in trouble for doing dishes after 8pm\u2026."]}
