We thought that it would be fun to do a potluck dinner, where people brought a food from where they were from. This was in June. \n\nI am from the United States, and not a big metro area. So there\u2019s not exactly a ton of interesting cuisine from my area. The dish I decided was most relevant to bring is comprised mainly of pasta and chicken, with a sauce. It\u2019s not the most complex dish, it\u2019s not something that would wow you, but it\u2019s a local dish and it\u2019s good, so I made it and brought it. I made it homemade, so I did put effort into it.\n\nI brought it to the dinner and my friends seemed to like it. However, a couple of people that I am not as close to, and the girlfriend of one of my friends(\u201cElla\u201d), were not impressed. She had been one of the ones to put more work into organizing it. \n\nI don\u2019t know Ella too well but we\u2019ve met a few times and she\u2019s always been nice to me and I\u2019ve been nice to her. Her partner is from Japan and brought a really good dish, and something I had never tried before. Ella asked who brought the pasta and when I said I did she just said \u201coh\u201d. Afterwards she texted me saying that I should\u2019ve brought something \u201cnicer\u201d. She hasn\u2019t talked to me since and some other people also said stuff to me saying that I was rude by bringing what I did to the dinner, but we made up. There also have been several jokes made about it. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was wrong but the more I think about it the more I wonder if I should\u2019ve just brought nothing. I did try and I did make a local food, but maybe I should\u2019ve left the food to the people with more interesting local foods and stuff people hadn\u2019t tried. \n\nAITA for bringing what I did?", "created_utc": 1689106337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x22bg/aita_for_what_i_brought_to_a_potluck_of_cultural/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or is just a judgement on your American pasta dish? \n\nI cannot imagine her reaction for what I would bring as a Canadian.

One time in college I invited some visiting students from Spain over for a potluck.  They brought a traditional frittata that consisted of potatoes, eggs, and I think onions.

You could have made spiedies, salt potatoes, white hots, half moon cookies, beef on weck sandwiches.  I could go on.\n\nETA: I see you made chicken riggies.

Four pounds of potatoes, 3 quarts of water, and about a cup of pickling salt.  That's enough salt to raise the boiling point so the potatoes are almost creamy inside when they are fully cooked.  Then you drain the potatoes and they have a decent coat of salt on the skins.  Typically eaten by cutting them and dipping the chunks in melted butter.  It's a BBQ food, along with the spiedies, hot sausage patties, white hots, and possibly clams.", "Those look awesome!"]}
