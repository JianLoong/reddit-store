If you can\u2019t go, don\u2019t go. Most people manage to find childcare for one night. And parents deserve a night out, too. Obviously if it\u2019s a long flight, or you have no family nearby, then you can discuss with the bride and groom. Is there a local babysitter they trust to watch any children? \n\nIt\u2019s one night. It\u2019s not forever. I like kids and I have two of my own, but I also had a child-free wedding before I had kids and no one complained.", ">Technically it is your wedding but I find child free to be rude honestly. Weddings are a pain for guests and expensive, have to often take time off of work, travel expenses and gifts. So you want family to come but leave children where at home- are you paying for overnight sitter? Leave children at another part of the hotel - did you arrange for baby sitting services at the hotel your guests are staying at? While it is your special day you put an undue burden on guests with kids to the point where they may not be able to attend as a result. And yes, I do find it odd you are ok with one kid from your side of the family. Nothing like some hypocritical favoritism when joining a new family.\n\nIf the child is in the party then it's fine. But I find your demand that your kids always be invited to everything extremely rude and entitled. \n\nWeddings are expensive as hell. We didn't invite kids to ours because we were already pushing 250+ without them. We both have large families where both sets of parents have 7 siblings each.  All those aunts and uncles had at least 3-5 kids. Then those kids all have 2-6 kids. Do you see our problem? And we didn't have an expensive venue or anything. \n\nAdding kids would have been a nightmare. Plus, everyone deserves a night out without kids. I've seen weddings ruined because a child was running around and pulled down cakes, decorations, or ran into a server with a full tray of empty glasses. Let adults have one night to themselves once in a while. Not everything revolves around your kids.", "Wow, does your employer cover childcare? That's awesome!", "You keep commenting\n\nJust say you want people to pay for your babysitters when they invite you places and MOVE ON.", "So others have to suffer the brats? Nope", "We had a kid free wedding because there would have been 12 kids under 7 on the dance floor. My adult friends love to dance (not sexy, just goofy) and they absolutely could not have done that whole worrying about accidentally kicking a kid in the face. The dance floor would have been completely controlled by the whims of the kids and that was not the vibe I wanted.\n\nWe considered inviting teenagers, but then one of my cousin's teenagers (who always tries to sit next to me at social gatherings and pouts when I want to spend time with other people) tried talking to me about marvel movies at my grandmother's graveside. I decided I didn't want to talk about marvel movies or Pokemon at my wedding. \n\nKids don't know how to adapt to situations that are not about them. They literally don't have the social awareness developed yet, and I know my cousins are not good at wrangling their kids and prefer to let them be the center of attention. I didn't want children setting the mood of my wedding.", "There's no burden and the invitation is just an invitation. Anyone can accept or decline for any reason.

If you want a reception without the chaos of children, or don't feel comfortable having children around lot of alcohol and the excess that can result, but still invite kids anyway, that means renting an extra room, hiring a babysitter, and providing children's activities. On top of everything else. It's not financially feasible for everyone. And not all venues even have the option of a separate children's space. And not all venues/caterers offer children's plates, so their meals could easily be $30+ plate, even if a three year old would never finish it!", "You seem to think that weddings are about the guests, and they are not.

Of course it would and the fact that she hasn\u2019t done anything to try and help find a solution that doesn\u2019t cause alienation is very telling. For example, we have some autistic people in my family that can get overwhelmed and guess what I plan for that and have an option available for them to step away and have their tablets or what they need when we have large family events. I would never say hey so and so gets overwhelmed and may not behave well or normal so let\u2019s exclude them. No as a functioning adult I can anticipate Y so I plan for X accordingly. In the case of OP, if I wanted a child free which I get as adults wnat to let loose, I would host reception at a hotel so no one had to worry about being drunk and getting back to hotel. Id also arrange baby sitting services or make sure the hotel had that option. So guests could make those arrangements ahead of time.

His mom was pissed because they're her sisters and she was so mad they were acting that way. The kid in question was like 12, I think.

Plenty of kids are around alcohol all the time, and plenty of adults don't WANT to get drunk, whether their kids are there or not. It's like the posters think people are sober for exactly 18 years because they had kids or something. Another one I see a lot is that parents will leave earlier if their kids are there.

As I said, only ONE mum complained, and there were 350 people at my wedding, family and friends.

A wedding, by the very fact that it's a *wedding*, is about the hosts, who graciously wish to share their special day with their own special people.\n\n\nBut *any event* is hosted by a person or persons who wish to share the event with those people they specifically choose.  Hosting does *not* extend to having to invite those persons you don't want there, whether tiny or fully grown.\n\n\nAnd let's not ignore cost.  Kids at a wedding cost the same as the adult you really wanted there!  OP, feel free to point this out.  Some people only get it if you couch it in monetary terms.  Which you only point out, thoughtfully, as a courtesy--not because you're cheap or whatever, but just because you don't feel like paying the $150 plate cost for their child when you can have your best friend there!\n\n\nFor a child to be expected to attend at an event for adults who are close to you is just ridiculous.  If you're personally close to a particular child is one thing, but why should OP be expected to invite *anyone* they're not close to?!  If an adult invited to any event whatsoever cannot bear to attend without their child there, that's *never* on the host or hostess, but on that invitee.\n\n\nOP:  Never explain.  Just call their bluff--refuse to be manipulated or bullied!!--\"I'm so sorry to hear that you aren't able to come.  Thank you for letting me know ahead of time.* even if you just heard it via others.  Because, what bullshit's this, anyway.

I still hear about it 35 years later from a couple of relatives. \ud83e\udd23", "Nta. Be grateful, more seats!", "NTA this is your wedding! You can simply say I'm sorry you feel that way you will be missed. People throw a tantrum in hopes that you will give in. That is not how it works they are the ones being selfish by putting demands on your wedding.  Surround yourself with love that day and write off those who want to be negative.", "NTA.  If that\u2019s where they want yo draw the line, good riddance.  Tell them \u201cthank you for rsvping no, now I can invite more friends!\u201d", "Remember that an invitation is not a summons. An invitation with conditions is even less so. Some people see weddings a certain way, like a family reunion, and don't like child free events. So long as you are polite about it and accept the folks who won't come can make their own choices, NTA.", "Yta because you aren\u2019t having a child free wedding. You are having one child but not the other kids of your loved ones.  \n\nWhy can someone from overseas not get a babysitter for a night?", "This \ud83d\udc46", "That\u2019s presuming that there are other kids it kid friendly activities included. Not every family/generation has that dynamic. The problem is everyone pursuing the same family dynamic even if that\u2019s what is not the dynamic at the time.", "The wedding PARTY is much different than wedding guests.  The wedding PARTY gets their pictures taken with the bride and groom.  The wedding PARTY wears matching outfits and has a job in the wedding.  The wedding PARTY also usually eats at the same table as the bride and groom.  Guests don't  get the same treatment.", "And therefore they\u2019re getting special treatment. It is hypocritical to make other guests abide by rules and make exceptions for the \u201c wedding party\u201d just because you have closer relations. Again, op can make what ever rules they want to, but it is still biased and hypocritical."]}
