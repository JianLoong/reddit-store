I wasn\u2019t about to remove people I see and speak to regularly and have a fantastic relationship with from my guest list to invite someone\u2019s child that I have met once or twice in my life and doesn\u2019t even know my name.", "The bride and groom didn't force anyone to have kids. Not all events are all ages. it's the parents' responsibility to find childcare for events where children are not allowed.\n\nIf you can't find childcare, you dont attend.", "I used to kind of agree until I read that horror story last week with the kid having a melt down throwing cake on the dance floor at the reception and now I can understand not even wanting to chance it.", "I'll take it you have kids. Decline if you don't like the stipulations. It's not Your Day and you're not required to attend. Your children aren't entitled to attend. Your loss, not theirs.", "This sounds like someone who thinks their children are gods gift to the planet and everyone should kowtow to their every need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChildren are often a nuisance at weddings, running around and yelling. Child free weddings are only growing in popularity. If you can't afford a sitter or feel so strongly say home, wedding is happening with or without you.", "No one wants kids at a wedding. They disrupt the ceremony, they scream and cry, and it\u2019s straight up dangerous to have them on a dance floor full of adults who may have been drinking, are wearing heels, etc. It\u2019s also very loud. And the parents can\u2019t relax when they\u2019re vigilantly watching their kids (or, they get hammered and drag some other poor family member into watching the kids).\n\nAs many people on this sub have said, a wedding invitation is not a summons. If you can\u2019t go, don\u2019t go. Most people manage to find childcare for one night. And parents deserve a night out, too. Obviously if it\u2019s a long flight, or you have no family nearby, then you can discuss with the bride and groom. Is there a local babysitter they trust to watch any children? \n\nIt\u2019s one night. It\u2019s not forever. I like kids and I have two of my own, but I also had a child-free wedding before I had kids and no one complained.", ">Technically it is your wedding but I find child free to be rude honestly. Weddings are a pain for guests and expensive, have to often take time off of work, travel expenses and gifts. So you want family to come but leave children where at home- are you paying for overnight sitter? Leave children at another part of the hotel - did you arrange for baby sitting services at the hotel your guests are staying at? While it is your special day you put an undue burden on guests with kids to the point where they may not be able to attend as a result. And yes, I do find it odd you are ok with one kid from your side of the family. Nothing like some hypocritical favoritism when joining a new family.\n\nIf the child is in the party then it's fine. But I find your demand that your kids always be invited to everything extremely rude and entitled. \n\nWeddings are expensive as hell. We didn't invite kids to ours because we were already pushing 250+ without them. We both have large families where both sets of parents have 7 siblings each.  All those aunts and uncles had at least 3-5 kids. Then those kids all have 2-6 kids. Do you see our problem? And we didn't have an expensive venue or anything. \n\nAdding kids would have been a nightmare. Plus, everyone deserves a night out without kids. I've seen weddings ruined because a child was running around and pulled down cakes, decorations, or ran into a server with a full tray of empty glasses. Let adults have one night to themselves once in a while. Not everything revolves around your kids.", "Wow, does your employer cover childcare? That's awesome!", "You keep commenting\n\nJust say you want people to pay for your babysitters when they invite you places and MOVE ON.", "So others have to suffer the brats? Nope", "We had a kid free wedding because there would have been 12 kids under 7 on the dance floor. My adult friends love to dance (not sexy, just goofy) and they absolutely could not have done that whole worrying about accidentally kicking a kid in the face. The dance floor would have been completely controlled by the whims of the kids and that was not the vibe I wanted.\n\nWe considered inviting teenagers, but then one of my cousin's teenagers (who always tries to sit next to me at social gatherings and pouts when I want to spend time with other people) tried talking to me about marvel movies at my grandmother's graveside. I decided I didn't want to talk about marvel movies or Pokemon at my wedding. \n\nKids don't know how to adapt to situations that are not about them. They literally don't have the social awareness developed yet, and I know my cousins are not good at wrangling their kids and prefer to let them be the center of attention. I didn't want children setting the mood of my wedding.", "There's no burden and the invitation is just an invitation. Anyone can accept or decline for any reason. If you can't find childcare then don't go.", "fair isn't always equal and equal isn't always fair.\n\nIt's her niece. She wants her there. Her brother is coming from overseas and his entire family that would watch said child is going to be at this wedding. You're expecting her brother to drop her kid off to some stranger just because other people might be upset about it? No f\\*ck that. It's her wedding and her choice. She doesn't need other peoples children there that are not related to her.", "You said no, but then restated what I said in a different way. You apparently have not attended many weddings, or you would know that this is pretty normal.", "Who do you expect her brother to babysit her niece? Her family is going to be at this wedding and they live overseas. Do you expect him to leave his child with a stranger so that he doesn't offend anyone? Yeah right. It's her choice. She wants her niece there and she is the flower girl. One child isn't going to be a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but 15 kids would.", "It\u2019s a private event. So it factually is... my wedding my rules. No one is forced to attend if they don\u2019t like the rules. \n\nNiece has a role in the wedding. She is not a guest.  Her parents can worry about how she will be entertained.", "Welcome to the real world, where you don\u2019t get to dictate how other people spend their money.", "Which 15 adults should be uninvited from the wedding to accommodate 15 children?", "I mean there are a lot of parents of children in the comments who disagree with you and think what OP is doing is fine. No one gets to speak for all of the parents and not all parents are as entitled as you.", "God forbid you think of your guests and how best to accommodate them and have your vision of the day. They are their to celebrate you why make it more difficult to do so.\n\nMy SIL let kids from her side of family attend but not mine and I always resented that. We don\u2019t see relatives too often so some that flew all the way out to attend basically went to ceremony but not reception so we didn\u2019t get a chance to really spend time with them. It\u2019s just rude to ask people to jump through that many hoops and it\u2019s not the foot to start off a marriage on. It is OP choice but for the reasons I stated I would not choose it.", "Kids not behaving parents should take outside in that story the parents didn\u2019t and most likely kid is used to parents not doing anything.", "I say kids you say brats I think that sums up your view of the world.", "Normally child-free means kids are allowed at the ceremony but not the reception. Post doesn't make it clear what her plans are.", "Double standards are rude, which is what it sounds like your SIL did. But that's not what's going on with OP's wedding. She's made an exception for the single child involved in the ceremony. Every child who would be just a guest isn't invited.\n\nWeddings are expensive. If you want a reception without the chaos of children, or don't feel comfortable having children around lot of alcohol and the excess that can result, but still invite kids anyway, that means renting an extra room, hiring a babysitter, and providing children's activities. On top of everything else. It's not financially feasible for everyone. And not all venues even have the option of a separate children's space. And not all venues/caterers offer children's plates, so their meals could easily be $30+ plate, even if a three year old would never finish it!", "You seem to think that weddings are about the guests, and they are not. It\u2019s an invitation not a\nSummons. No guest is entitled to attend. If you can\u2019t attend that\u2019s fine. I have a problem with couples who do child free but then get mad when people can\u2019t come.", "\"your vision of the day\" says it all.\n\nIt's NOT YOUR DAY!", "And the fact that you think everyone else has to bear the responsibility of your choice to have children sums up YOUR view of the world.", "Not necessarily. I've never been to a child free wedding where the kids were allowed at the ceremony but not the reception. It depends on the couple. \n\nEither way, as a parent, I wouldn't want to bring my kid to the ceremony. That is the most boring part and they don't understand what's going on.\n\nYou know well enough in advance to make arrangements for a babysitter for those who are in town. \n\nHer brother is the exception since niece is a flower girl plus, they live overseas which means his only support system in this area would be family who would be attending the wedding.", "Yeah kids complicate things for sure but the reality is people have kids, so she can\u2019t be upset that people aren\u2019t coming and expressing the reason to her parents and that this is causing a rift. Of course it would and the fact that she hasn\u2019t done anything to try and help find a solution that doesn\u2019t cause alienation is very telling. For example, we have some autistic people in my family that can get overwhelmed and guess what I plan for that and have an option available for them to step away and have their tablets or what they need when we have large family events. I would never say hey so and so gets overwhelmed and may not behave well or normal so let\u2019s exclude them. No as a functioning adult I can anticipate Y so I plan for X accordingly. In the case of OP, if I wanted a child free which I get as adults wnat to let loose, I would host reception at a hotel so no one had to worry about being drunk and getting back to hotel. Id also arrange baby sitting services or make sure the hotel had that option. So guests could make those arrangements ahead of time. Like in the invitation say reception child free but hotel has  baby sitting services you can utilize.", "I was referring to the bride and how people view it as their day lol reading comprehension. But to me, the day is about being a good host though especially when wanting these people to celebrate with you and give you gifts.", "Never said that. But OP can\u2019t be surprised that intentionally excluding certain family members especially of the family she is marrying into is going to back fire like it has. \n\nPs - kids have a right to exist and go to places just like adults. I may not want to be near small kids on a plane but I recognize they have a right to be there and travel too.", "Sounds like you need to get over what your SIL did, you\u2019re projecting hard all over this post. None of the \u201cpoints\u201d you\u2019re making are actually points. Public transportation is not the same as an invitational event. \n\nShe\u2019s not intentionally excluding certain family members. She\u2019s excluding children that aren\u2019t in the bridal party. Be for real, now."]}
