They would yell at and only punish Leilah over ridiculous things. (An example is how they expected Leilah to put her shoes in a specific order in the shoe cubbies and re-arrange the other shoes if necessary to maintain the specific order. Everyone else just got to leave their shoes wherever.) They never showed any actual interest in Leilah in a positive way. They forced her to pay for all her own extracurriculars and figure out carpools because they would refuse to take her. Leilah revealed to me later that the first time an immediate family member came to one of her non-mandatory events was when I was 13 and my friend and I bought tickets to Leilah\u2019s talent show. Our parents basically kicked Leilah out the day after she graduated high school, despite Leilah never doing anything bad. She was always respectful to them and did chores. I still don\u2019t understand why my parents treated Leilah the way they did. Leilah and I talk regularly but she wants nothing to do with our parents as they\u2019ve made no attempts to make amends or apologize for treating her terribly. My parents were loving and involved with me growing up, but we only communicate once a month maximum, largely because of how they treated Leilah.\n\nAbout two years ago, my father was diagnosed with an illness that I will not disclose for privacy reasons. The condition itself isn\u2019t life-ending but it is very debilitating and my mother is unable to care for him by herself anymore. My mother knows Leilah and I talk regularly, and reached out to me because she needs help but doesn\u2019t want strangers in the home nor to put my father away in a treatment facility. My mother knows that I cannot as I have a family of my own that needs me. My mother told me that I need to convince Leilah to help because my mother has been trying to reach out to Leilah but Leilah won\u2019t respond to her. I told my mother that Leilah has a life of her own and she should respect Leilah\u2019s choice not to help with our father. My mother went off about how one of her friends\u2019 kids quit her job to take care of her parents and called Leilah a selfish asshole for not helping. I snapped at my mother that her friends' daughter probably quit her job since her parents actually treated her like a daughter and if they hadn\u2019t treated Leilah terribly then maybe they would actually have a child to help take care of her and my father too.\n\nLeilah told me that my snapping at my mother was justified because being sick/unlucky doesn\u2019t erase your own bad behavior, but Leilah is obviously biased in this situation. A bunch of my other family members, including the ones who don\u2019t talk to my parents, said that I should have had more compassion with my parents despite their past mistakes.

It kind of sounds like the thing we hear about from children of narcissists where one child is the golden child and the other one is treated like shit. Your mom seems pretty oblivious as to the damage she\u2019s caused, or she knows and doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m glad you stood up to her on behalf of your sister.", "NTA. She and your father are reaping the consequences of their behaviour and actions.  \n\nThere's a reason so many adults are estranged from their families. And I don't consider it \"estranged\" I consider it \"escaped\"...\n\nAgain, NTA.", "You're a good person to stick up for your sis against bullying. And for not candy coating the truth to your Ma. You're NTA at all.  Hope your parents wise up and apologize to Leilah for those years of shaming and pain.  It'll do em some good.", "NTA.   When my mother suffered a traumatic brain injury, I put everything on hold and went home to care for her.   One day, as I tied her shoelaces, she burst into tears and apologised to me.\n\nI told her that I could remember her tying my shoes many, many times.   I didn\u2019t mind returning the favour.\n\nYou were completely right.   If your parents had been parents when they were needed, maybe they\u2019d still be parents now they need to be.", "NTA.  Bless you for standing up for your sister!!", "NTA. You spoke the truth and nothing more. Your parents will have to make some hard choices because Leilah's living her own life minus 2 terrible parents.", "NTA\n\nThey made their choice all those years ago.  This was a part of that decision - \u201cif something happens in the future, she won\u2019t be there for us\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely disgraceful that anybody in the family would think Leilah should put her life on hold to dedicate herself to helping either one of them.", "NTA. Being late to a parent teacher interview is a mistake. Forgetting to pay for the next piano lesson is a mistake. Packing the wrong lunch is a mistake. Forgetting to put their uniform in the wash is a mistake. Emotionally bullying and mistreating your child for 18 years, having no communication since you kicked them out, and then demanding they jump into action when you want them to is not a mistake. Your sister isn\u2019t biased, she\u2019s realistic - there is absolutely no evidence that they would treat her any differently if she did help them and they have made no effort to reconcile with her. They called her names when she said no. They have no respect for her as a person, let alone as their daughter. Your other family members are minimizing the mistreatment she\u2019s had and telling her that she should accept it and help them - no she shouldn\u2019t. Being born to a family out of sheer genetic chance doesn\u2019t mean shit these days. Yeah it mattered back when your neighbors could and would kill you for your cows or food or house or land etc. your expected life span was 30, and you relied on inheritance to survive (yes inheritance is still a thing but not to the same extent it was) but these days not so much of a problem. \n\nYour parents were abusive to her and still have no remorse and make no effort to fix their fuckery. Even when they \u201cneed\u201d her, they can\u2019t muster up enough decency to try and make amends.\n\nEdit to add - you say that you benefitted from your parents behavior, but there isn\u2019t a limited supply of kindness or decency in a parental pie. Parents with more than one kid don\u2019t go \u201cwell this is child number 4, time to treat the others a little worse to compensate, or we keep the split and treat one like shit,\u201d. Yeah there are challenges in having multiple kids, but love and respect isn\u2019t a finite resource. You didn\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d how they treated you compared to your sister, they made that choice. Giving her arbitrary rules didn\u2019t mean you benefitted more. \n\nYou may have been the golden child, but that was never a choice you made nor something you controlled. At least you didn\u2019t treat your sister the way they did and that screams volumes to your character.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s bias happens to fall in the right direction. Your parents are bad people because good people don\u2019t treat their or really any child like that. Bad things happening to the just and unjust alike. They sowed their rotten seeds, and this is their harvest.", "NTA.  If you want your kids to take care of you when you\u2019re old, don\u2019t abuse them in childhood.  My father went through dementia and died alone because of how badly he treated us kids.  None of us were willing to take care of him, or even see or talk to him for the last 5 years of his life\u2014though it was even longer for another sib.  Once our mother died we all bailed.\n\nIf we\u2019d had a decent dad in childhood, we would have put up with all the horribleness that comes with dementia.  We would have dealt with the anger and the rage and all the other associated stuff if we all didn\u2019t have ptsd from having had him as a dad.", "NTA and Leilah is lucky to have you. Do they KNOW how their parents treated her, and that it was done in front of you? If not, might be time to have a public Airing of the Grievances.", "NTA.  \n\nUnrelated, but perhaps Leilah and you should do DNA tests to see if you share the same mother and father. I have no reason to think otherwise, it was just the first thing that came to my mind when reading about how bad your sister was treated.", "NTA Since these family members feel you should be compassionate towards your parents why aren\u2019t they. I mean they could go help your parents they aren\u2019t strangers.", "NTA at all, and your friends saying you should not have said anything as you benefited from your parents evil behavior should fuck all the way off. You never asked for them to treat you better than her. You actually give a shit about your sibling, and your mothers is an outright demon for trying to belittle your sister\u2019s perfectly sane boundary. I can\u2019t even call your sister your mothers daughter because how could she treat a child she bore so cruelly??", "NTA, Your parents are lucky your older sister isn't vindictive enough to just have APS home your dad.", "\u201cA bunch of my other family members, including the ones who don\u2019t talk to my parents, said that I should have had more compassion.\u201d\n\nThanks for offering to care for my dad, Uncle Jack! He\u2019ll be thrilled you want to show him compassion and reconnect.\n\nNTA", "NTA Some people told you that you benefited from your parents raising you, so you shouldn't judge them, but that's just absurd. First, it's irrelevant to the issue at hand whether you judge them, because Leilah gets to make her own choices. The second, you don't owe your parents anything for raising you, because that's their job as parents. Third, it's axiomatic that if parents want adult children to help and support them, parents need to work hard to create that environment. Fourth, even if there is something to the ridiculous logic that they raised you and made you who you are, nobody can say for sure whether you would have been an even more amazing person if you had different parents, parents who knew how to treat all of their children well.\n\nIt sounds like your parents and some of your extended family are narcissistic and some of them are trying not to rock the boat. The problem for them is that it's too late. The boat already capsized, now they're asking for help, but the people who could help have long since drifted away.", "NTA\n\nHere are the consequences of your mother's actions...", "NTA. Keep fighting for your sister. Your sister is not biased, she\u2019s the one who experienced all of that abuse, and therefore, the only person who actually has valid opinions on the effects of your parents\u2019 treatment of her.\n\nYour parents are entitled assholes who pop out children as a retirement plan.", "No you most certainly are NTA for being honest and holding that mirror up to your mothers' face. The audacity of her to treat Leilah like an indentured servant and kick her out as soon as she could and then think that she can manipulate you (and her) into bringing her back to be taken advantage of, and shit on, and abused. Your parents are reaping the toxic rotten seeds that they chose to sew many years ago. Good on you for standing up for her. You are the sibling she deserves.", "NTA your sister deserves better your parents don't", "NTA. Throw your whole family away, except your wonderful sister. Your parents are demons. Like wtf is wrong with them? Continue to support your sister, you're a wonderful sister.", "NTA. You get out what you put in. You may have benefitted, but that\u2019s still pretty weak. Your parents treated your sister like they didn\u2019t want her around. So she is obliging them.", "It was bad for you, being raised sort of adequately while seeing them abuse your sister.  (Because watching abuse is awful)  You are lucky that you *have* a relationship with your sister, despite them.  I totally respect for for that!  NTA.  It would be bad for Leilah for you to try to convince her and bad for your relationship with her.  Neither of you owe your parents anything, for abusing her and making you watch.", "NTA. I see why you feel the way you do but\u2014\n \nThey are keeping some HUGE secret from you. No one, and I mean no one, treats their young child that way for no reason. Maybe its her ***true*** parentage? Just guessing. Whatever the reason is, it\u2019s big.", "NTA. You told your mom no more than the simple truth. They did not 'make mistakes' as parents, they systematically drove your sister away from them both emotionally and physically, and they don't get to play the 'family ties' card now.", "This is a perfect fit for OhNoConsequences.
