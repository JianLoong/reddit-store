I love being a senior dog mom!  It's not that there isn't work involved with senior dogs, but giving a dog a loving, safe, forever home in its golden years is my passion.", "I think it's also crucial for the person who has to do the work to decide on the animal too. There are so many factors to consider when choosing a dog: Size, temperament, energy level, personality, dietary needs, habitat needs, independence, availability of a vet, etc. \n\nLike, you don't get a person living in an apartment with no AC in a warm climate and working 12 hour shifts a Husky, then say \"I guess you'll have to buy a house then, lol.\"", "I agree. Especially on \"any living creature\". For one of my birthdays a friend of a friend gifted me a marigold plant. It does within 2 months :(\n\nI didn't own any plants because I used to frequently travel for work, sometimes being away for 3+ weeks. It's been 7 years, I still mourn that dead marigold plant. :(", "> Also, NO ONE SHOULD EVER GIVE ANOTHER PERSON A LIVING CREATURE AS A SURPRISE GIFT!!!!!\n\nThe only exceptionI see to this is if parent  \"gift\" a pet yo their young child. As caretakers with the child\n\nim willing other opinions though", "Exactly.\n\nFuck all the people who give baby chicks and rabbits for gifts on Easter.", "Same here.  I get my fix by babysitting my friends' dogs when I'm available.", "Bot account", "They are younger than boomers. Oldest would be Gen-X. OP is 24.\n\nEnough with the hate. There are, I am certain, terrible decisions made by parents in every generation, and some good parents (who will still make mistakes) in every generation as well.", "Yea like, when I was a kid I wanted a dog SO BAD yet my parents said no for years. Finally they surprised me with one when I was around 11 and although I was absolutely thrilled and loved that dog with all my heart I was a little bummed I wasnt able to be involved with picking it out and naming it (my parents named her themselves), but I'm so glad they got her for me cause she was the absolute sweetest. Dogs are a big commitment, my girl passed away earlier this year at 11 almost 12 years old. Springing a 10+ year agreement on someone with no prior discussion is selfish and unreasonable.", "You're right about the parents not asking and invading her space with a dog. 100 % correct.\n\n\nMy problem with OP is how she responded. Op knows it too, that's why she posted this thing in the first place. \n\nIf she felt that she was in the right, we wouldn't ne here. She wants strangers to help her feel validation in her decision.", "I chose to get a puppy (wasn't allowed to rescue) and my god I don't know how I actually did it. My life is completely different now (she's 1.5yrs) and this was with 2 adults in home and 3 different households offering dogsitting and help", "I'm also a cat person and when I adopted cats in 2020, it was four adult cats. After we lost one to cancer, I wanted another and fell in love with a five month old cat.\n\nI'd totally forgotten how crazy kittens could be - and he wasn't even a tiny kitten like the previous one I had twenty plus years ago. Not only is this guy (now just over a year old) bold and gets into everything, he is smart and figures out ways to get into trouble no other cat I've owned has.\n\nSince these will be the last cats I own - I'm seventy one - I'm of two minds about adopting this kitten. I'm glad I got him and experienced the joys (and annoyance) of owning a kitten one last time. But dang, he can be a total nuisance and a total joy.", "With a helping of \"It's past time you had a baby anyway.\"", "I disagree. For one boomer and zoomer has evolved to more of a mentality description than an actual birth year. Plus I'm 29 and my mom is 69 so it's definitely possible their parents barely fall into boomer age range", "Ok but op is still nta", "People, fellow redditors, stop down voting this comment. It was a legitimate question.", "I mean, now we're coming to the end of it, I'm starting to feel the puppy fever again and have to keep reminding myself how hard it was.", "I feel much the same about cats--love cats, but I like them better when they are mostly past the asshole kitten stage, so that's what I adopt.\n\nI also love dogs, but have never had one because I am well aware that they are SO MUCH MORE WORK than a cat if you want them to be well-adjusted, well-behaved canine citizens.", "Shelters are now, at least in my area, strongly recommending that kittens only be adopted in pairs: that way they can burn off some (but by no means all!) of the energy and need for stimulation on each other.  They're that much of a handful.\n\nWhich is to say, I feel you.   Mine are two years old now, and have *mostly* settled down.", "It's only forever. That's not long at all.", "Sorry Mrs Jackson. Woowoowoowoo", "In your opinion OP can be whatever you want. For me op is an AH!.", "Like, I kind of get the thought process of something to love and cuddle up with you when you are feeling sick. But damn, the last thing someone fighting cancer needs is a new responsibility!", ">But she\u2019s half remote and he\u2019s 100%. They explained this. Still rejected because \u201cif they\u2019re working they can\u2019t pay enough attention to the cats.\u201d\n\nThis is utter madness. Would they have preferred them both to be unemployed with no money to provide the cats with the care they need?", "They wouldn\u2019t adopt a cat to a couple because they worked?  That\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Well, for what it's worth, fostering may be a good option to help with your puppy fever. All the puppy love, none of the long term commitment... :-)", "That's fair it is your opinion and I can't change it", "I know right!? I was utterly flabbergasted when they told me this. Then they didn't even care what happened to the cat if she died. This happened about 25 years ago and I'm still shaking my head sadly. :-)", "There are a lot of \"shelters\" right now that take in cats and purposefully deny adoptions for petty reasons so they can keep them. That way they receive government funding to hoard cats. Many of them also charge a fee just to apply to adopt a cat even if you get denied. The whole thing is just a way to scam people.", "No kidding.\n\nI mean, I could see it if it was like my situation was for a while - single person, lives alone, studio apartment, works six or seven days a week long hours.  If they only wanted one cat that would be a bad situation for most cats.\n\nBut two bonded cats to two people with a house working only 40 hours a week, mostly at home?  Nuts.", "A pleasure chatting with you. Have a great friday.", "Thankfully they have real lookalike cats that feel, purr and meow just look normal cats, costs a pretty penny though. Last I checked it was about \u00a3300.", "Yes, unfortunately, there are quite a few rescues that are nothing but animal orders or bleeding hearts where everything has to be perfect for the cat. The type of people that will put down an animal before they'll let someone else take care of it. I've had experience with that type too.", "You as well mysterious stranger", "Do they have them 25 years ago? If I had known such things existed I would have suggested that. That's actually a good idea for someone in that situation. Can you imagine someone doing the litter box in pain from cancer? They were trying to foster off their dying friend on a cat. They were tired of her trying to get reassurance from them. They would have had the money to buy such a cat substitute.", "I love the Simpsons and he sounds like the perfect dog for the name.", "I wouldn't know about that, I think it's been around for the past 10 years though. It's similar to the idea of a real baby (although I like the idea, at the same time I find the lifelikeness of the doll unreal and creepy especially the lifelike eyes). \n\nBut I was looking to get a more lifelike cat for my daughter as I didn't have the time and commitment for one just yet, but there were no in-betweens there were cheap toys and expensive cats which said were good for alzheimer's. But you learn something new everyday, and if my nan ever got bad I'd suggest getting her one and would get everyone to chip in."]}
