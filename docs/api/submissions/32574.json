NTA. Getting a puppy is not a small thing. I love dogs. I absolutely adore them. I want to get one and have been thinking about the responsibilities, time, care etc. and did not get one yet. They can\u2019t just force you a gift of extreme responsibility. You did right. Because that pupper would suffer if you can\u2019t spare enough time and care for it. \nAlso, I hate people who give dogs as gifts. Would they give a human kid as a gift to someone?", "Not only are you NTA, but you're a genius who is taking care of your own business.  Sheesh, I wish more people your age had your wisdom.", "NTA.  It\u2019s only appropriate to give a pet as a gift if the recipient has been involved and enthusiastic about the selection of the pet.  If the recipient is a kid, than both the recipient and their parents need to be involved and enthusiastic.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019re likely giving an unwanted burden.  No living, feeling being should live its life as an unwanted burden.  It\u2019s cruel to both the recipient and the pet.", "NTA\n\nYou do not surprise someone with 10+ year obligation like that and then go \u201coh well now you need a bigger house haha\u201d have your parents always been jerks like that?", "NTA. A 15-year responsibility should never be given as a surprise. It's not fair to you or the dog. Bad idea, maybe well intended, but still a bad idea.", "Definitely NTA - puppies are forever, not just for Christmas! I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t half-ass take care of it for a little bit, then dump it at an overcrowded shelter in a few months like a lot of people do.", "Pets are not presents!", "NTA. Your parents are highly manipulative, but you handled it brilliantly.", "NTA, and it\u2019s more responsible and caring to the dog to know you can\u2019t take care of it, than to get one that\u2019s alone and cooped up. I don\u2019t think you were too blunt at all, you tried being nice, when that didn\u2019t work, you switched to firm. That\u2019s the correct escalation.", "NTA. I feel bad for the puppy. I hope it goes to a good home.", "NTA  \nNo 1 rule, do not buy any animal to a person unless it's asked  \nMorover a puppy takes a lot of time to train and it's a real investement  \nI really don't understand what was their reasoning (and no moving to a house won't change anything you'd still have to take care of the dog)  \nI hope the puppy is fine and not abandonned tho", "Nta.  Live animals should never be a surprise gift", "NTA. Getting puppies as a gift is always a horrible idea. Your parents are trying to force you into living a life they want you to live (in a home, with children, etc.), but you're an adult and can do what you want.", "NTA puppy is like a child they need your time and your care, you can't just get a puppy and leave it in the house. It's great that you actually said no because honestly if you had taken the puppy and not care for it that would have been a AH move", "NTA. It was the responsible thing to do. Your parents, on the other hand have been utterly irresponsible. I hope the puppy goes to a wonderful home, and fair play to you for knowing what you can and cannot provide.", "NTA. An animal that you did not ask for is never a gift. It's an obligation. They should never have got this animal without ensuring that you were willing and able to care for it. It's their problem.", " I feel badly for the dog, but you ace'd this.  I took me a bit too long to have your ability to say no.  NTA.", "NTA \nAs several people have already said a pet isn't a gift, it also these feels like your parents are trying to make some sort of weird power play to force you to live the way they did.", "NTA. PETS ARE NOT GIFTS!! This is how shelters and rescues become overcrowded once Christmas passes and people realize that cute \u201cgift\u201d is actually a 10+ year commitment.", "You are NTA at all, your parents ATAs for even thinking this was okay. Are they buying you a house with a big yard for the dog abd making the mortgage payments, paying for dog training and a dog sitter? No?

You absolutely have the right thought here. Also, their argument about having kids makes no sense. No one showed up at their apartment and dropped off a baby. \n\nNTA. Your parents are being ridiculous.", "Nta and well done. Never apologize for setting firm boundaries!", "NTA\n\nAnimals are not toys to foist on people. They were irresponsible to give you a dog without conferring with you first.", "you are an asshole plain and simple man i'm sorry to tell you. you must HATE dogs because they are convienent for baby especially pitbulls. i bet you think casey anthony was guiilty.", "NTA\n\nPuppies are not gifts, you are correct in that they are a massive commitment. Not only did your parents thoughtlessly give a puppy as a gift but were manipulative AHs when pushed back on this. Really messed up behavior on their parts.", "NTA\n\nGiving someone a puppy as a gift is usually a terrible decision. It\u2019s only maybe acceptable if they live in the same house as you, and/or they have told you explicitly that they want one as a gift.\n\nYou handled this really well.", "You absolutely did the right thing. NTA.\n\nPeople love puppies; even if it ends up in a shelter, I'm sure it'll get adopted quickly by amazing owners. You don't need to spend the next 8-15 years of your life caring for a pet you never asked for.", "NTA. Owning a dog is equivalent to 16~20 years of commitment. Which is longer than some marriage these days. In other words, it's not an easy task. You're being responsible by returning the dog, when you can't guarantee the time and effort to care for it.\n\nI love dogs, but even so I'm still holding back in getting one. A surprise gift like that to me is going to be a surprise stress, because I'm not ready.", "Wow. NTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople who buy puppies as surprise gifts are the worst! Getting a dog is a massive 10+ year responsibility. I love dogs, but no one should ever be doing surprises like this.

What with training them not to pee and poo all over the dang place, and also taking them to the vet, for their first needles. Definitely NTA OP.", "NTA. Live animals are not good gifts, especially when it comes to family in rental properties. Houses and apartments are both subject to landlords allowing pets and charging pet deposits, in addition to the animal itself requiring the added expenses of food and medical needs that does not fit everybody's budget.", "I love dogs. Dogs are a massive commitment for many years. My dog is 16 and going strong. \n\nYears ago, I worked in an animal shelter. Do you know how many dogs were given up because they were a gift, and the new owner couldn\u2019t handle it? Too many.  A gift is a necklace. Shoes. Ugly art. A book you won\u2019t read.  Tickets to see that one guy from that one band.  \n\nA pet is a commitment, a responsibility, and a life. Not a gift. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Pets should never be surprise gifts. Animals are huge commitments and they are not all the same. Every animal has a unique temperament and unique needs that should line up with their humans.", "The ONLY time a pet is a good gift is when you know the person wants one. You don't give the actual pet as a gift though, you go to the local shelter and get them an adoption gift voucher. And if you're really feeling nice, get them a gift card to the local pet supply store. That way, they pick the pet they actually bond with.", "NTA. It's the same vibe I get when people in those holiday commercials buy cars for their family members. Did you put no thought into this? Did you consider the time? The effort? Now I have to scramble to find a place to live cuz what if this is a no-pet apartment? I have to uproot everything I know because you thought you were being kind.   \n\n\nGood sentiment, terrible followup.", "NTA\n\nSpringing a dog on someone who has not agreed to owning one is a major AH move. I say this as a dog lover and owner. Dogs need food, water, a space to do their business, exercise, toys, vet visits, training, and more. There is nothing wrong with people who don't want that commitment, and if someone is not prepared for a pet they are given, they will likely be bad owners.", "NTA.  It is just wrong to give a dog for a pet without prior approval.  Also, love my dog to death, but it can be a real pain in the ass sometimes to have one", "NTA.  They wanted to gift you something without your consent that would be a major life changer for you.  Tell them you'd prefer a houseplant and point out which one you want.", "NTA. What ever possessed them to think that was a good idea? They've owned dogs before, they should know the responsibility and time needed to raise a puppy. You were responsible and told them no, then held your ground on the issue. Good on you!", "NTA, no one should give any living thing - from pets to plants - as a gift. All you are doing is burdening someone with an obligation. If someone wants that, they can make their own choice and decision on it.", "NTA\nAnimals are not suitable as surprise gifts. Your parents were out of line doing this.  Thank you for not accepting an animal you can't care for adequately.", "I don't understand the expectation for us to handle parents with kids gloves.

You had to be that blunt otherwise they would have left you with the dog.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey thought it was a nice gift, but they didn't once think about it from your perspective. Then, they continued to push it off when confronted with that fact. You stood your ground and shouldn't feel bad about it.

Not even for a second. *THEY ARE THE A-HOLES*\n\nI am a dog person. I adore dogs. They are amazing creatures and I looooove them, but I waited until I was 38 and had a partner that having a dog with worked and something we both wanted. I lived a really incredible and interesting life until I chose to get a dog (it\u2019s now incredible and interesting to me in a completely different way *with my dog*, but *I had to be ready to male that choice*). \n\nHaving a dog is an incredible responsibility and I commend you for understanding that. You are caring for another being and their happiness and health is very important. If you are not financially, mentally, or emotionally ready to commit to that, then you shouldn\u2019t have a dog-so being aware of that and politely declining was an act of impeccable awareness and principle on your part. \n\nYour parents may have acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d in their hearts, but their actions were incredibly inconsiderate, irresponsible, and obtuse.", "Agreed. You said it all. I have a little dog called Max and he's my world.", "I love dogs and have always had at least two, and sometimes three. (I currently have three.) But I *never* have puppies.

And, crucially, since I'm the one who has to do the work, I am also the one and only person who gets to decide whether or not I'll do it.
