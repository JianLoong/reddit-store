{"id": 21526, "submission_id": "14skdam", "title": "AITA for not agreeing with my husband that I shouldn't drink??", "selftext": "Ok, so it's a long one. \n\nI'm originally from England, but I moved to Australia when I was 19, I was there for 3 years and about a year and a half in I got together with my husband who is Chilean. \n\nHe was on a covid visa, which allowed him to overstay his working holiday during the pandemic. We spent the whole pandemic living together and fell very much in love. About a year into our relationship he made me aware that he would need to go home(Chile) at the end of his visa. Eventually, he asked me to come with him. I was scared because we had only been together a year, and if I followed him there I wouldn't be able to work, I wouldn't know the language, and I would be very heavily dependent on him. But I loved him, more than I had ever loved anyone, so I decided to take the jump. \n\nHe left 7 weeks before me, and this was pretty tough on our relationship. Wed just spent everyday of a year and a half together, this being the first time we spent apart. Towards the end of the 7 week period he asked me to marry him, this was because so far a lot of our problems had come with the stress of it being hard for us to stay together due to complications with visas, and this would allow us to stay together, wherever we may be. I said yes, I arrived in Chile and we had a small wedding in an office here in Chile. \n\nIt was quite a culture shock when I arrived here, and I'm still getting used to the language and culture, but I finally feel as though I am settling in nearly a year down the line. \n\nThere is a bit of an age difference between me and my husband, I am 22 and he is 29. Which hasn't been too much of an issue so far but that brings me to the problem. \n\nThings are a bit more traditional here than what I am used to in the UK and Australia, in that I feel like I'm expected to be more submissive. I am fine with this, I actually prefer this dynamic mostly. I let my husband take all decisions regarding our relationship. Especially since I still am unable to work here due to a long processing time with my partnership visa. I spend most of my time at home just practicing Spanish and doing the cooking and cleaning. \n\nThey love to have BBQs and his family, especially the males, drink a lot (only on weekends). I never drink as much as them, and always go to bed first. But my husband seems to think Im drinking too much. Sometimes I throw up, and sometimes I'm hungover the next day. But I never make a fool of myself, and if me and him argue it's always because he tells me to stop drinking and it's frustrating because I never really get to do anything, and on the weekends when something's happening he expects me to just sit there quietly and watch. \n\nI understand the culture is different, but he knew who I was before I came, he knows I'm young and I don't party all the time, but I certainly do like to have fun. And I feel it's unfair to expect me to change this much? Am I the a**hole?? If not how do I get him to understand my side?\n\nEdit: Ok yeah, so just wanted to clarify he drinks and goes out far more than me. And the throwing up only happens sometimes like I said. I'm not drinking to the point of throwing up everytime we drink and I never make a scene or a mess when I do. Most nights when we drink I'll have 3 or 4 drinks, occasionally I'll go up to maybe 6 or 7 if it's a particularly long night. He will easily drink double what I do on the nights we drink together, plus goes out without me. Also would like to clarify it's not every weekend that I drink, but would say maybe 2 weekends a month.\n\nAnd no I don't have any friends but have grown pretty close to some of his family", "created_utc": 1688674349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14skdam/aita_for_not_agreeing_with_my_husband_that_i/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get where most people are coming from about the alcohol, but I feel like that\u2019s not what this is about. Why is everyone jumping on that? OP clearly said that people (men) are drinking a lot on the gatherings, and there are some circles and cultures where heavy drinking is normalized which of course isn\u2019t great. But in this context it truly doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s husband is worried about health if him and his buddies or relatives drink just as much. So I feel that\u2019s not what should be judged here. If her husband would be worried about that or her behavior he should clearly state that. \n\nAlso, some people are just easily hungover. I sometimes get a headache/light hangover from two glasses of wine. And if I drink more than that I sure to get a hangover.

That's the start of alcoholism. Especially if when confronted with the idea of having to slow down drinking it starts a fight. That's just not normal to regularly fight over too much drinking. \n\nAll in all- there's an easy fix- stop drinking for a while. If that ends everything- the issue was probably the drinking, and not controlling behavior. \n\nIf he moves onto controlling another aspect of your life- get marriage help and tell him he needs to work on that. \n\nIf you can't stop drinking for a few months- he was right, that's a problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What OP does need is a hobby.", "I mean, throwing up means you\u2019ve drank too much but having a hangover isn\u2019t an indicator of that at all. It\u2019s ok to get drunk on the weekends, and getting drunk usually leads to a hangover.", ">But the root of the problem seems to be that you think drinking is the only fun you get to have. Sounds like you need to find other ways of having fun so you can live the life that YOU want to.\n\nI agree. OP mentions that, apart from drinking, her main activities are cooking, cleaning, and learning Spanish. She could benefit from cultivating a hobby or two.", "I strongly suggest making your own friends. Find an expat group to meet up with. Go to language classes in person, not online.  Maybe with some independence your life will be more fulfilling. But right now you are on a slippery slope to isolation", "So if she is drinking too much and her husband is expressing concern how is she not the AH?", "Or is the sit the quietly and watch her interpretation of him saying don't get drunk. Sadly I've met people like that, if they are not main character and/or drunk they see it as just sit and watch... when it's more like just be part of it w/o having to be center of everything", "\\>The drinking isn't even the issue at hand, the issue is he has no right to control you or your choices however silly they might be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm controlling if I stop my wife from driving my Corolla off a cliff? What sort of logic is this? He is expressing concern that she is drinking to the point of vomiting. \n\n\\>otherwise you are going to end up 35 with 3 kids and a man who is constantly cheating on you with younger women while you stay locked up all day in the house doing childcare and housework.\n\nAITA try not to invent fantasy scenarios to demonise men (impossible)", "OP is drinking to the point of vomiting. She doesn't mention her husband drinking to that point even in the edit. I think its safe to say that he is drinking a lot but not overstepping his limit while OP is.", "How to said you don't know nothing about South American without don't know nothing about South American.", "Nobody\u2019s saying \u201cdon\u2019t drink alcohol ever,\u201d but habitually drinking to the point of vomiting and hangovers is not healthy.\n\nI\u2019d also love to know how long this has been a pattern for OP.  Or did it just start when she uprooted her whole life to move halfway around the world with a husband who wants her to sit and look pretty when she\u2019s not cooking and cleaning?", "Lost my sister, she was only 42.", "Sometimes you tell yourself you won't drink too much, but then you're four deep and moved by the unholy spirits, and all of the sudden a fifth seems like a great idea... \n\nDo that a few times and you'll learn to eat something and cut yourself off much sooner. Or at least I hope so.", ">I'm curious if the men (including OP's husband) also regularly drink enough to throw up and get hangovers\n\nI'm curious about that too, but OP didn't mention her husband vomiting from excessive drinking. While he drinks more than her, it could be that his body type or experience with drinking allows his body to handle more.", "I used to drink to cope with social phobia. I had a hard time being around people without having a panic attack, so I drank. A lot. That was thirty years ago. Now I can\u2019t touch any alcohol at all without having a bad reaction (almost an allergic effect, tight chest pains, palpitations, hyperventilating etc), not even a single mouthful."]}
