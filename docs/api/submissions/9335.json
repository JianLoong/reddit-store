Remind me to avoid you like the plague because yikes on bikes.", "She falsely accused someone who tried to help her of sexual harassment. How is she not an asshole? They weren't at school. Why are you trying to deflect blame onto them?\n\nThat's without even looking at your theory that boys/men shouldn't help girls/women potentially prevent life changing injury just bases on gender.", "In a commercial gym too.. I'm wondering how he got a membership and where the adults were. Every gym I've ever been to has a rule of no minors unless accompanied by an adult. Not saying this couldn't be real, but I have my doubts.", "Great. From now onwards, I won\u2019t be telling the school when there are false rumors spreading about me and when I\u2019m being recorded", "The gym I go to is very beginner friendly, it\u2019s not a powerlifting gym or anything like that. Gym management wasn\u2019t there during that time because they have scheduled times. And if it was a basic excercise like barbell curls, I wouldn\u2019t interfere, but it was deadlifts. Doing deadlifts with the wrong form can cause serious back damage", "At this rate she isn't just going to remain suspended, she's looking at getting expelled.", "That's why the staff is there. And if she wants ti olay stupid games let her win stupid prizes.", "Really?  \u201cMost people know proper form\u201d?\n\nI go to the gym 2-3 times per week, and have been doing so since about 1989 when I joined the Navy. I don\u2019t know proper form for deadlifts. It\u2019s not something I do for a workout, so I have no clue what oroper form for a deadlift is.", "Until it happens to you. You dodged a bullet!", "They gym I go to is open 24 hours but the gym members are only there until 6pm. So they weren\u2019t there", "I'm sure the girl who ends up with a crippled back for the rest of her life will really appreciate this advice", "So the best thing to do is to let her injure herself?", "I'm sure those half naked woman just screaming for attention by wearing basically nothing and filming the \"reactions\" of others have it so hard\n\nThere's woman only gyms all over the place, if it's that bad just join one of tbose", "A 14 year old athlete definitely has the capacity to recognize a problematic weight lifting technique. This is an insanely condescending response, you lose all credibility when you somehow find a way to flip it back on him saying you could probably point out errors in his own routines. \n\nHelping someone avoid injury at the gym is not an unfounded claim to authority. Gatekeeping obvious and necessary workout corrections certainly is.", "Damn you really showed that 14 year old who's the boss", "Women shouldn't have to go to a women's only gym to be left alone by men", "If I were doing something wrong that could be dangerous to my health I'd want to know, as long as the person telling me is not acting creepy or arrogant.", "So those attention grabbing attempts we see all over on TikTok where a woman goes and makes squats right in front of some guys while filming and then complaining about them online when they happen to look slightly in her direction is completely justified?\n\nAs far as I can tell it's a trend by now, they want the attention", "No offense to OP but I would probably struggle to have much belief in a 14 year old being that knowledgeable about good form.", "I'm afraid I'm not as thirsty as you so videos like that aren't on my tiktok. But women are allowed to do squats at a gym and men should be respectful and not stare.", "Perhaps, but that's beyond the point. To discourage trying to help people because the receiver might interpret it wrong, even if there is a pattern of people harrassing others at the gym .. that feels just as another kind of toxic to me."]}
