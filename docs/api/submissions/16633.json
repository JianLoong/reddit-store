This is a plot to get your land. He did it on purpose to make you move. NTA.", "NTA. He has 25 acres and built a damn poultry facility within 300 feet of you? That\u2019s so shitty.", "NTA. And from experience, the Amish are far more business savvy and legally aware than they portray to the general public. This guy knew and knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.", "NTA. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. He could have built that chicken barn anywhere on his 25 acres. He did not have to build it so close to your house. You have a right to ask the township to enforce the laws so that you can peacefully enjoy your property.", "NTA Laws and regulations exist for a reason. Your neighbour is tricky, I'm quite sure they did this knowingly and expect to get away with it by playing the victim card.", "He had 25 acres and built the chicken barn less than 300 feet from your house\u2026really? NTA.", "NTA, your innocent amish neighbour is AMAZING. Doesn't know the law but knows enough to push the building close to another property and far from his, wow!", "The AH is the zoning officer who didn't do his due diligence.", "NTA, you have rights just as he does. Though I would say it should be on the township to reimburse him for the reasonable cost to fix the issue.", "NTA", "NTA", "Plant bamboo along the fence line and put a root stop on your side. within 2 years the bamboo will be almost to the barn.", "[deleted]", "ESH He definitely should have checked the minimum distance requirements and odds are he will have to move his barn 63 feet - a hassle but doable.   You will still hear and smell chickens, as you should if you live in a farming community.   You have made yourself a parish in the community for pretty much no benefit.", "First of all, NTA.  However,  you're kind of foolish, in my opinion.   Do you really think the 63 feet would have made any real difference?  You spent $10k over 63 feet.  Even if you had won, he only would have moved his operation 21 yards.  You'd still have noise and dust issues.", "I mean EHS. \nI totally understand your frustration but I\u2019m just wondering how 63ft is going to make a difference for you guys. If you did end up winning likely they would just move the barn 63 feet which in all honesty probably wouldn\u2019t do any better for you sound-wise or feather-wise. It really does suck. You guys have to put up with all that and it sucks that he spent so much money on a lawyer for it to not work out in your favor I do feel for you. But petty revenge of the real thing and I don\u2019t think you would be doing yourself any service by continuing to pursue this.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but yeah yta. You move to the country you have to expect country noises. It sounds like this barn is pretty darn close, close enough that without you literally measuring it may actually be in the clear. Their barn was approved and so I assume they did everything above board. It will never cease to amaze me people moving to the country and farms and being shocked by the consequences of that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What an asshole", "It is shitty because when the wind blows the right way and OP or a member of OP\u2019s family is a little under the weather, they\u2019ll end up with histoplasmosis. My sister got it almost 40 years ago and still has breathing issues. It\u2019s no joke. I\u2019d force the issue and slam back at the townsfolk that is an imminent threat to the health of a child and that is unacceptable. \n\nI\u2019ve got Amish & Mennonite family.

It is actually a two-story barn and the farmer intends to fill it to max capacity which he states is 7,000 birds. Considering it\u2019s an open-air barn, we couldn\u2019t possibly safely live next to that. The township is quite large and is is largely agricultural, but his particular property borders the rural residential district so he is surrounded by residential homes. He is not in the middle of nowhere like the other farms around here.", "Having to live next to 500 birds instead of 7,000 would definitely be beneficial to our well-being. Like I stated, I didn\u2019t write that law, the township did and he is \u201cunknowingly\u201d in violation of it. \n\nAlso, he has stated that he cannot move it because he built a concrete foundation.", "That\u2019s not really the point, though. Would 63 feet have made a difference? No. But this is an actual measured issue and hypotheticals are irrelevant. The law is clear and he is in violation of it.\n\nAlso, he cannot move it as he built a concrete foundation.", "At this point might be time to go postal, especially if the city doesn't do anything. Fight fire with fire, but carefully, plausible deniability.", "I should mention- after talking to the farmer, he told us that the max capacity and the amount he was planning on putting in the barn was 7,000 birds. This isn\u2019t petty revenge. This is concern over our peace and well-being. Our home existed well before this barn.", "It's 263 ft... The setback was 500ft.", "It never ceases to amaze me how people like you skim a paragraph and decide it's just dumbass city folk being dumbass city folk instead of a savvy businessman buying 25 acres beside an established neighbor, overstocking his animals, and then playing dumb yokel in court to gain the sympathy of the townspeople.", "There are rules in rural areas too and most of those rules are for good reasons. OP has measured it, it is objectively wrong which is why the farmer is seeking a variance. You don't do that unless in the wrong.\nAnd rules normally relate to issues like OP is facing - waste in back garden and personally  I'd be checking ground water and soil for contamination.", "How is 3,000 chickens and 200 roosters country noises? My husband is from a rural area and the house in the back has about 20 chickens and 1/2 roosters.", "We grew up in a farming community. We are absolutely used to smells and noise. The neighbors surrounding us have chickens and roosters. This is next level. I can\u2019t go to any room in my house without hearing chickens and roosters. I can\u2019t read a book in silence without having to wear ear plugs. Setback distances for poultry operations exist for a reason.", "There was a post on here a month or so ago about a teenager that upset farm neighbors and the neighbor retaliated by setting up pigs nearby only they didn't mess up with zoning. \n\nI feel strongly this is a land grab or they pissed someone off because:\n\n>suddenly the townsfolk present there start screaming at us for \u201cbullying this farmer for trying to make a living\u201d and how this is the country and we\u2019re obligated to deal with these issues because we need farmers.\n\nTotally Staged.", "We testified in front of the townspeople about how we\u2019re scared of diseases being carried over with the wind and they all claimed \u201cthat\u2019s part of living in the country\u201d.\u201d I mean, who doesn\u2019t like a little asthma or a side of E.

They are also in Canada. Central and South America also have Russian & German baptists who dress and live similarly to Amish & mennonites. My in-laws live in several states, Canada, and Belize. It\u2019s either mennonites or Russian Baptists who have encroached on other people\u2019s land in Mexico and are driving away bees and butterflies.", "The farmer has 3000 chickens and 200 roosters. That\u2019s quite a lot more than the 500 total birds allowed within 300 feet. It\u2019s not the 63 ft. It\u2019s the deliberate choice to build it right on (over) the border, when you\u2019ve got 25 acres to choose from. I agree with others in this thread, it\u2019s probably a deliberate attempt to drive down the price of the neighboring property so they can expand the farm cheaper. \n\nBut they measured wrong and now have to play dumb in court instead of saying to OP: \u201ctough luck - we\u2019re within the ordinance\u201d. \n\nImage having 200 roosters next door, shrieking all day.  Not to mention the contamination. They probably have to sell anyway, but if I was OP I would at least make it hurt a bit first. NTA", "Thanks... I'm dyslexic... Totally read that the first time backwards.", "Yeah, I would always hear 2 or 3 near my in-laws house in the morning and I could never determine who owned the 3rd rooster I kept hearing. So I guessed it'd be the neighbors in the back.", "Well, one lives and learns!  I know there were some German communities in South America, but assumed all the hyper religious ones went to the US."]}
