{"id": 11333, "submission_id": "11gk7xc", "title": "AITA for exposing a kid at my school for faking a Russian accent?", "selftext": "New student transferred to our high school,  he talks in a really strong Russian accent.  As someone who speaks Russian, (I'm from Turkmenistan but family immigrated to America) I was intrigued and started talking to him in Russian. However, I quickly realized that he didn't  speak Russian and was faking the accent. He just laughed and responded in English and walked away.\n\nI didn't say anything because I thought it was just a harmless joke. But as the weeks went by, he continued to speak in the fake accent and even made up stories about life in Russia. I started to get really annoyed because what he said was obviously complete bullshit, I actually lived in Russia for a while.\n\nIn study all I overheard him talking to a group of girls and he's bragging about how he was the best at assembling Ak47s in school (we actually did that in Turkmenistan and Russian schools, that's not a stereotype) and a bunch of made up shit about russia. When I asked him why he was pretending to be Russian, he got really defensive and said I was an asshole for calling him a liar, so I spoke to him in Russian and at first he was able to say a few words back in Russian but later he couldn't respond and told me in English to shut up and leave him alone, so i kept talking to him in Russian and told him in English to respond back in Russian or he's a big phoney. He eventually yelled at me to leave him alone and left. I followed him and he said that he just wanted to fit in and thought it was cool. I told him that it wasn't cool to lie about who you are, and that it was disrespectful to people who actually come from Russia. He didn't take it well and ended up storming off.\n\nEventually, word got around and he was exposed to the entire school. He was humiliated and stopped showing up to school. I got called in to the principal's office and later counselor's office. They talked to me about bullying and said I was being a bully and I needed to write an apology letter and i refused so they got really angry. They talked to my parents about this who then threatened to sue them as one of my dad's close friend is a lawyer and threatened tot sue the school for creating a hostile environment for immigrants and said he was mocking me since I am a Russian speaker so the school dropped it. I even made fun of the principal to his face knowing he could do nothing about it.\n\nI did see him that day, only day that entire week he came to school and was only in the principal's office. He told me I was an asshole and it was just a \"social experiment\" and that I didn't need to cockblock him. He never showed up to school again and we saw on facebook that he goes to another school in the area.\n\nNow, I'm starting to feel guilty about it. I don't know if I did the right thing by exposing him. On one hand, I feel like he deserved to be called out for lying. On the other hand, I wonder if I went too far and hurt him more than I intended.", "created_utc": 1677799581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gk7xc/aita_for_exposing_a_kid_at_my_school_for_faking_a/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You going after him about it? A bit much, but whatevs, it was your way of life, so I get it.

Just called someone out on their lie.\nIt sucks that the kid had to lie in order to feel like he could fit in, that's... Very sad tbh. I hope the kid is able to make friend with folks in his new school without the need to lie about who he is and where he is from.\nKids fuck up all the time, and everyone will keep fucking up for the rest of their lives, cuz that's just how we learn. I wouldn't worry too much about this, because it just sounds like a typical school experience.\nMove on and just remember that everyone is a person with their own feelings and thoughts.", "YTA. I was on your side until you started mocking the administration. Why couldn\u2019t you just apologize for the hurt you caused him?

OP should have displayed more empathy whilst obviously being thruthfull  about the situation. Not dealing with it is not the answer, but showcasing an attitude of someone who cares about this kids wellbeing could have made a huge impact.\n\nThis helped no one, in fact it turned this a lot more messier that  it need it.", "His point was he was doing a racist stereotype of Russians", "NTA", "YTA.
