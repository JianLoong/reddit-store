Your BIL has a mental illness, but he also has an extended family giving him a pass for all bad behavior. This is extremely unhelpful and toxic for all involved.

AllI said was she should be prepared because people don\u2019t away react rationally when grieving and talking to him and encourage knowing she truly is okay with him going if that is his desire is okay.

Whether or not it is justified( and yes he shouldn\u2019t blame her clearly) he will become resentful, that\u2019s why I said she should encourage him to go."]}
