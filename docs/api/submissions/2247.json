While the city I currently reside in isn\u2019t the most dangerous, it\u2019s not exactly the most safe either.  \n\nMy apartment complex, like every other place where students reside, requires a valid student ID for the doors to open. Last night, I decided to reward myself with some take-out food since I\u2019ve been studying for finals non-stop. My apartment is one of four buildings at small crossroad (there\u2019s a building to my left, one in front of me, you get the picture\u2026) and I mention this because it\u2019s usually a very crowded area. People are leaving the buildings constantly. There\u2019s always a risk of a non-student getting onto the premises, but for the most part it\u2019s other residents who are tailgating each other. \n\nAs I was waiting for my delivery driver, these two guys walk along the side of the building and approach the main entrance. They were around my age, but definitely taller. They sit on the nearby bench and, after a good five seconds, I realize that they don\u2019t live there; most likely, they have a friend that does and they\u2019re waiting to be let in. No big deal\u2026 it\u2019s the responsibility/choice of their friend to let them in the building, not mine. Unfortunately, one of them made eye contact with me and I took a few steps to distance myself. They were still lingering outside the door after five minutes. They never pulled out their phones (from what I saw) to communicate with whoever lived in the complex. They were just *waiting.* \n\nFor additional context, there has been a string of car break-ins lately. Not to mention a homeless man actually got into the building a couple of weeks ago and threatened a residential advisor (the cops had to be called and it was a big mess). Also, due to some past trauma, I\u2019m hesitant around men I don\u2019t know. My phone alerts me that the delivery driver is less than two minutes away. And, as if on cue, the one closest to me hollers, \u201cHey, you got your key card?\u201d\n\nI turn around and flat out told him: \u201cI can\u2019t let you in. It\u2019s a security issue.\u201d This man had the audacity to look at me as if I had grown two heads; he looked genuinely offended. I further explained: \u201cLook, it\u2019s school policy. I don\u2019t know if you live here and I could get in trouble.\u201d He turned back to his buddy to say something. Then this black car pulls up, but it\u2019s not my delivery driver. The guy rolls down his window and says, \u201cCome on, we gotta go.\u201d \n\nThe two men waiting outside my building scattered like roaches and the car took off. My food arrived soon after and I swiftly made my way into the building, making sure I wasn\u2019t being followed. I managed to eat my food in peace, but I still have no idea if I was just being paranoid; I even felt a bit guilty for \u201cpolicing\u201d a situation like that. Did I overreact? Did I have the right to deny them entry?\n\nAITA?\n\n**Edit:** For clarity, when the car pulled up and the driver said \u201cWe gotta go\u201d, the men didn\u2019t get in the car. They ran in opposite directions and the car took off down the road. Also, he didn\u2019t ask me about my card under the guise of assuming *I* was locked out\u2026 he asked me the same way a few other people have in the past. I recognized the tone; as if I could do them a favor. Some of you might think that\u2019s a stretch, but I knew what he was asking from how he spoke to me. And if he thought I was locked out, he would\u2019ve asked me.", "created_utc": 1668363633, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu9kb8/aita_for_refusing_to_let_two_strangers_into_my/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Super sketchy behavior that seems in line with how bad actors would behave.  I'd report it to security so they can review any camera footage.  Maybe it's nothing, maybe it is but it's at least something for them to go on.", "**NTA**\n\nIt was someone letting a stranger into my apartment building that resulted in my car being stolen from our underground parking lot. That would have been bad enough except that I'm disabled and was dependent on it, and it was such an old car that the insurance money wasn't enough to replace it. I've been pretty much housebound ever since. And that's only ONE example of the things that can go wrong when people ignore security measures. \n\nGood for you!

It's not your job to let them in. If they want to get in, they'll have to wait for their friend.", "NTA. The basic rules ask residents to NOT do this. And besides, that's what cell phones are for. Call your friend so he can let you in. If he's not in his apartment, then wait for him to return. Its just a security issue consideration that renters should respect.", "NTA. \n\nSecured buildings/areas are secured for a reason. You didn't know these  people. You are not responsible for them but you could be found liable if something happened.  They can go kick rocks, and so can anyone else who wants you to let them in.

Give them the best description of everything you can (e.g. the car was a dark-colored 4-door sedan, or the car was a black SUV and the individuals involved were wearing \\[color\\] clothing). I would also wait for any food deliveries from inside the building from now on, unless there really isn't a good way to be watching for it (no windows in/either side of the door)", "NTA. Basic common sense and etiquette is that no one should expect someone unfamiliar to let them into a residence. \n\nI am a small woman and, when I\u2019m waiting for someone to buzz me into a condo or apartment and a resident lets themself in, I say \u201cIt\u2019s cool. I can wait to be buzzed in,\u201d just so people don\u2019t feel uncomfortable. \n\nIf you HAD let them in, then you would be the A because you\u2019d be making the decision for everyone else in the building without their consent.

Keeping things safe, at the risk of mildly inconveniencing two strangers is just dandy. You're not being paranoid, you're being cautious. You didn't overreact, you reacted properly. You had the right to deny them entry, just as you have the right to have a residence that is free of randos wandering the hallways.", "NTA. You were way beyond polite. A couple of days ago I had someone buzz my intercom asking to be let in. I just said \"no\" and hung up. \n\nIt's flat out dangerous to let someone you don't know in.", "NTA. Maybe they were trying to get into the school library to pick up young women.", "INFO because this reads like they were waiting to be picked up, how sure are you that they weren't offering to let you back in? They could have assumed you were stuck outside.  \nYou say it took you 5 seconds to realize they don't live there. What made you realize that? Do you know everyone in your building? You say they were right age. Looking at you in confusion would be explained by them knowing you live in the same building and being surprised you don't recognize them. \nYou're not an AH for what you said but I have a feeling you got this situation wrong.", "I agree. This just screams suspicious behavior. Reporting this to security together with the hour and location is a small effort.", "Ditto. Never the ahole when it's a safety issue whether your safety or others. Do not worry about offending someone or not being 'nice' in those situations.", "This wasn\u2019t the library; the library is a public building. This was a residence hall where students live.", "Why would anyone pick up people in a library?", "Yeah. This would get you fined when I lived in the dorms. Its a security issue.", "It was a joke from another post where some older guy would go into a college library to try to pick up young women 10 years younger than him and couldn't understand why he got kicked out of the library.", "That\u2019s your home.  Would you let two strange men into an apartment you were living in off campus?  No! Trust your instincts and don\u2019t worry about being a people pleaser.  They were up to no good.", "NTA I think your concerns were reasonable.\n\nAlso this was worth reading just for the phrase \"scattered like roaches\".", "Agreed. NTA, and please report, OP.", "That I couldn't answer. There was a post on here yesterday about some guy creeping in a college library to pick up young women and he couldn't understand why he was TA and creepy."]}
