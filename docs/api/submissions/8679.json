A couple of us called but she didn't pick up, and she sent a text saying she was running late and she would meet us at the restaurant. She ended up coming close to 6.\n\nI talked to her later about being so late and managing her time better, Hayley made an excuse but I replied this was supposed to be a girls trip, not so she can go run off to do her own thing without thinking of anyone else.\n\nShe got pretty upset and we flew back the next day, but she kept quiet, and my sister said she saw her crying.

There were 8 of us including my cousin Hayley, (33f) who's one of my bridesmaids. We were only there for a couple of days and there were a few different things we wanted to do. (also I only asked people pay for their flight and hotel share, I paid for everything else)\n\nI made early dinner reservations for everyone on our last night, and we were going somewhere else after. Hayley mentioned that day she wanted to go visit a cemetery to pay her respects- I said okay but to be back in time to go to dinner. \n\nI made the reservations for 5 and it was already 4.30, but Hayley wasn't back at the hotel. A couple of us called but she didn't pick up, and she sent a text saying she was running late and she would meet us at the restaurant. She ended up coming close to 6.\n\nI talked to her later about being so late, Hayley made an excuse but I replied this was supposed to be a girls trip, not so she can go run off to do her own thing without thinking of anyone else.\n\nShe got pretty upset and we flew back the next day, but she kept quiet, and my sister said she saw her crying. I did text her later but she left it on seen.\n\nMy sister thinks I shouldn't have said that to her, but a couple of the others girls agree Hayley shouldn't have been late.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Given it was her late husband, it's very possible she got emotional and needed more time to herself to collect her emotions hence running late and not picking up. Or there was just a delay in getting back that was out of her control. Either way it's doubtful Hayley was intentionally late and she did not miss or delay anything very important, you could still eat without her e.g. some activity that needed all of you to go ahead. \n\nThese things happen on trips with lots of people - 8 like OP said. You always get a bit delayed no matter what due to this and that. Also more info needed as to whether Hayley is a serial late person or this was just a one-off.", "YTA. Honestly who cares anyway if y'all were able to be seated. 5 is egregiously early btw. And this would be my response even if she was running to drug store or visiting an old friend. But she was visiting her late husband's grave?! Oof you need to sincerely apologize ASAP.", "YTA. You don't get to dictate everyone's time. Yes, she can in fact go do her own thing and you don't really get a say in that.

As a widowed person, it\u2019s probably hard for her to even show up for these wedding festivities when she\u2019s clearly still thinking of her own love, wedding, and processing grief. Do you not feel any empathy for her? If you don\u2019t, try reconsidering the sanctity of your own marriage. that you\u2019d rather prioritize dinner and partying with the focus on you, over being there and having grace for a member of your own bridal party and family\u2014 someone who has lost the very thing you are celebrating for yourself.

That these very simple facts are something you can't comprehend as being more important than being on time to meet you for a dinner, makes me wonder what comprehension you have of getting married.\n\nYou were so deeply thoughtless, selfish and cruel.", "YTA, she gave you a valid reason why she was late and that reason was TOTALLY acceptable. Why does it matter that she showed up late?! This is only a dinner and not the wedding or reception. You went full bridezilla cause you couldn\u2019t handle not being the center of attention to everyone on this trip!", "YTA- she was visiting her husband's grave, clearly no longer local as she had to fly in. Of course she will want to go there whilst she's in NY?

You do not get to decide in what ways, or how long, or when someone grieves for a deceased loved one. It doesn't matter that you paid for most of the expenses. These people also paid expenses to be at your wedding, for you. To share in one of your most special of days.

How could she be so oblivious to the fact that once she agreed to this trip that she would need to be at your beck and call for every waking moment?? \ud83d\ude44\n\nDid it ever occur to you that part of her excitement was tied to the idea that she would be able to visit the grave of the man she was supposed to spend the rest of her life with? Did you maybe take a moment to realize that while celebrating your impending nuptials is exciting for you, it may be a little more bittersweet for your cousin? She can be excited for you and reminiscent of the feelings she felt leading up to her wedding. You are a HORRIBLE friend, she didn\u2019t ask you to sit at the cemetery with her or mourn on your weekend, she wanted a little time to herself and you couldn\u2019t even be respectful of that. I hope the future husband really understands what kind of person you are on the inside because I bet you will end up eating his soul on the wedding night.", "This is terrible karma to be stacking up for a bride to be. Better hope the universe doesn\u2019t treat you with the compassion you treated your cousin with", "That doesn\u2019t make it any less painful! Good lord you are a horrible selfish person! I feel bad for your fianc\u00e9 !", "Yeah, YTA. A raging, swollen, red one.", "News flash no one cares about your stupid dinner and wedding like you do and YTA. She was visiting a grave for her husband and you chastised her for having a few hours to herself to mourn?", "YTA. I\u2019m not going to pile onto you like others have done, I\u2019ll just say that, she may have had the best of intentions about getting back to dinner on time and then found herself grieving and unable to. You are about to get married, think about losing your fianc\u00e9, think about how she must feel celebrating your impending marriage while looking at the grave of her dead husband. She loved you enough to go, to be happy for you, you should love her enough to apologize.", "Well, I think your future husband will find it very comforting knowing that if, God forbid, he dies prematurely, you will get over his death and prioritize someone's dinner plans over visiting his grave after five years.", "She can still be excited, she was still ready to celebrate with you! Also seeing the grave of your husband is of course gonna make most people upset no matter how long it was. Think sincerely about this. Put yourself in her shoes for a sex. You may react differently than her but she is still valid.", "I hope all your friends got to see how selfish you are. I would never want to be friends with someone like you. I'm actually disgusted.", "Agreed. OP is totally bridezilla!", "This right here. Cousin was probably late because she didn't want to bring her sadness back to the Bachelorette festivities. OP is too self absorbed to realize that her cousin was late to avoid making OP's celebration sad and somber. She needed time to collect herself and be 'ready to celebrate'.\n\nIf it were me, I'm not sure if I would have been able to attend the dinner - even if I had originally planned on coming.", "The cousin didn't fail to show up,she texted and said she was running late and arrived around 6.", "Hayley sent text that she was running late.\nEven better than an email.", "It's worth noting that Hayley waited until the last night to visit her husband's grave.\n\nThis shows me forethought on Hayley's part, that she knew visiting her husband's grave would be emotional and didn't want to put a damper on the trip as a whole.\n\nHayley was probably late to dinner so she could compose herself and be properly ready to celebrate with OP.", "I mean if you have to leave out a detail then you are almost always the Person in the wrong!", "Nevermind. She placed it in the initial text.\nI almost missed it which is probably what she\u2019s hoping for!", "I just noticed and almost missed it when re-reading the text!", "Obviously it's more important - then Hayley should have bowed out of dinner plans and said \"hey, it's more important to me that I visit my husband's grave and I don't want to mess up everyone else's dinner plans\".   She didn't, she went along with making plans and then showed up late, which is rude and disrespectful of other's time (regardless of being late for a good reason)", "And making them pay for the privilege, and probably using valuable vacation time as well. \n\nAside, who eats dinner at 5 pm in NYC?", "[deleted]", "I hope her soon to be husband hears about it and rethinks marrying someone so heartless.", "Fr, imagine getting dead husband karma before the wedding", "She would have texted about running late then failed to show up for an hour or she texted after she was already late", "She either said it when she was already late or she said she was running late implying she was finished/finishing and still took an hour", "Well if its obviously more important why didn\u2019t OP have any compassion? Why did OP scold her and ice her out? \n\nHayley also communicated that she was going to be late and given how OP buried the lead about the dead husband I\u2019m guessing she was justified in being late as well.", "It\u2019s possible that she had every intention of being on time for the dinner but once she arrived at the cemetery, couldn\u2019t get herself to leave in time. I think OP should\u2019ve been more understanding. The dinner could go on without her. It\u2019s not like the restaurant refuses to serve them until everyone from the party was there", "What other people\u2019s time? She was late to dinner, and then they went out and did other things after. She didn\u2019t hold everyone else up, she texted and said she would meet them at the restaurant and did. They were all there, it didn\u2019t affect anyone else, or their plans.", "And with OPs reaction you think she would have been A OK with her outright canceling? \nMaybe travel time took longer than expected? I am sure that\u2019s not unheard of in New York", "Unless we are the only ones there, or they specifically say wait to order, I\u2019m not waiting in a party that big. Also, we don\u2019t know what Haley said or didn\u2019t say, OP is omitting information to make themselves look better. \n\nAlso, we don\u2019t know WHY Haley was late. There is only 1 graveyard that is still burying people in Manhattan, which is where I am assuming they are staying. Which means Haley had to travel to get to the cemetery. There could have been subway issues, or if she had to go out of NYC anything could have happened. \n\nYou are making a lot of assumptions that you have no idea about.", "One can only hope! But she'd probably blame the cousin."]}
