(also I only asked people pay for their flight and hotel share, I paid for everything else)\n\nI made early dinner reservations for everyone on our last night, and we were going somewhere else after. Hayley mentioned that day she wanted to go visit a cemetery to pay her respects (edit: it was to visit her late husband)- I said okay but to be back in time to go to dinner.\n\nI made the reservations for 5 and it was already 4.30, but Hayley wasn't back at the hotel. A couple of us called but she didn't pick up, and she sent a text saying she was running late and she would meet us at the restaurant. She ended up coming close to 6.\n\nI talked to her later about being so late and managing her time better, Hayley made an excuse but I replied this was supposed to be a girls trip, not so she can go run off to do her own thing without thinking of anyone else.\n\nShe got pretty upset and we flew back the next day, but she kept quiet, and my sister said she saw her crying. I did text her later but she left it on seen.\n\nMy sister thinks I shouldn't have said that to her, but a couple of the others girls agree Hayley shouldn't have been late.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675085429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p24sr/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_she_cant_run_off_to_do/", "score": 8218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There were 8 of us including my cousin Hayley, (33f) who's one of my bridesmaids. We were only there for a couple of days and there were a few different things we wanted to do. (also I only asked people pay for their flight and hotel share, I paid for everything else)\n\nI made early dinner reservations for everyone on our last night, and we were going somewhere else after. Hayley mentioned that day she wanted to go visit a cemetery to pay her respects- I said okay but to be back in time to go to dinner. \n\nI made the reservations for 5 and it was already 4.30, but Hayley wasn't back at the hotel. A couple of us called but she didn't pick up, and she sent a text saying she was running late and she would meet us at the restaurant. She ended up coming close to 6.\n\nI talked to her later about being so late, Hayley made an excuse but I replied this was supposed to be a girls trip, not so she can go run off to do her own thing without thinking of anyone else.\n\nShe got pretty upset and we flew back the next day, but she kept quiet, and my sister said she saw her crying. I did text her later but she left it on seen.\n\nMy sister thinks I shouldn't have said that to her, but a couple of the others girls agree Hayley shouldn't have been late.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Given it was her late husband, it's very possible she got emotional and needed more time to herself to collect her emotions hence running late and not picking up. Or there was just a delay in getting back that was out of her control. Either way it's doubtful Hayley was intentionally late and she did not miss or delay anything very important, you could still eat without her e.g. some activity that needed all of you to go ahead. \n\nThese things happen on trips with lots of people - 8 like OP said. You always get a bit delayed no matter what due to this and that. Also more info needed as to whether Hayley is a serial late person or this was just a one-off.", "YTA. Honestly who cares anyway if y'all were able to be seated. 5 is egregiously early btw. And this would be my response even if she was running to drug store or visiting an old friend. But she was visiting her late husband's grave?! Oof you need to sincerely apologize ASAP.", "YTA. You don't get to dictate everyone's time. Yes, she can in fact go do her own thing and you don't really get a say in that.

You wanna know YTA when you were mad at your cousin, who is a WIDOW, for being late because she went to pay her respects and spend time with her DECEASED HUSBAND?\n\nYes, YTA. Big time.

As a widowed person, it\u2019s probably hard for her to even show up for these wedding festivities when she\u2019s clearly still thinking of her own love, wedding, and processing grief. Do you not feel any empathy for her? If you don\u2019t, try reconsidering the sanctity of your own marriage. that you\u2019d rather prioritize dinner and partying with the focus on you, over being there and having grace for a member of your own bridal party and family\u2014 someone who has lost the very thing you are celebrating for yourself. That\u2019s very sad.", "YTA\n\nShe was visiting the grave of her dead husband. That these very simple facts are something you can't comprehend as being more important than being on time to meet you for a dinner, makes me wonder what comprehension you have of getting married.\n\nYou were so deeply thoughtless, selfish and cruel.", "YTA, she gave you a valid reason why she was late and that reason was TOTALLY acceptable. Why does it matter that she showed up late?! This is only a dinner and not the wedding or reception. You went full bridezilla cause you couldn\u2019t handle not being the center of attention to everyone on this trip!", "YTA- she was visiting her husband's grave, clearly no longer local as she had to fly in. Of course she will want to go there whilst she's in NY? And she wasn't even an hour late, you could have just text her to ask for her order or ordered for her if that was the issue.", "YTA and I am sure you are also a bridezilla. \n\nShe went to visit her dead husband!

This can\u2019t be real.", "YTA\n\nShe told you where she was going and she told you she was running late.\n\nIt's quite hypocritical to scold her for not thinking of others when you're obviously only thinking about yourself in this scenario.  \n\nIf I were Hayley you'd have one less bridesmaid.", "YTA .\nIt's not as though she was an hour late gallivanting around NY as you tried to play it off as. She was spending time at her dead husband's grave. She told you what she was doing. Have you always lacked basic human empathy", "YTA. She says a few minutes late because she was visiting her deceased husband. Not because she wanted to \"do her own thing\". Your words were heartless and just rude.

You do not get to decide in what ways, or how long, or when someone grieves for a deceased loved one. It doesn't matter that you paid for most of the expenses. These people also paid expenses to be at your wedding, for you. To share in one of your most special of days. You ruined that by picking straws where there is no hay. \n\nI do not think you should marry.
