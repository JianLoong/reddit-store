It's obvious from her partner's involvement because he's likely going to insert himself even after the baby's arrival.  I would also recommend trying to even temporarily blocking their phone numbers at least on your wife's phone so she can avoid the stress so you can help eliminate her stress.

I\u2019m sure you and your wife have been nesting like crazy up to this point and don\u2019t need somebody to come fuck it up for you. I wouldn\u2019t even pay for a hotel for her to stay at, YOU DIDN\u2019T ASK HER TO BE THERE. She\u2019s just inserting herself where she doesn\u2019t belong and using emotional manipulation to try and get her way so she can meet baby first and get bragging rights.

She sounds like the type to butt heads with you both on how to care for your days-old infant and what rules you want respected\u2014I mean she can\u2019t even respect you enough to make a plan to meet the baby, she just went and did all this without even letting you know! I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to be very difficult to deal with postpartum. I wouldn\u2019t let her anywhere near your house until you and your wife are settled. A 2.5 hour trip to come back later when you\u2019re ready for visitors isn\u2019t the end of the world. Even with a sick grandma in tow that\u2019s not a huge deal.

Period.\n\nI get that she has some fantasy in her head that she wants to see happen, but that is not realistic. And if she wants to play this game, tack on another few days til she gets to meet the baby. You will want to be uninterrupted *unless you reach out to others* for those first several days - Because in all seriousness those first days go FAST, are super important to the new parents and bonding, and recovery for the mother is extremely hit or miss, with the medical recovery, the hormone imbalance, the emotional aspect, straight up pain, sore on top and on bottom... did I mention all the fluids??? And post partum mental/emptional (serious ones) issues are a real thing. Many of us are medically slightly fragile for that first bit and we don't want anyone hovering unless we directly asked those people are actually helpful. We don't want anyone seeing us like that or interrupting our first days with our new extended little family.\n\nNo means **NO** and if your mother cant respect that then she doesn't respect either of you and needs to not come at all, frankly.", "What is it with moms thinking they are indispensable with newborns?  She wasn't invited, tell her to butt out and she's not staying at your house, period.  Tell her 'partner' to eff off big time.  This is none of his business at all and he's not welcome to come to the home at all.  I get sick of these grandma's thinking the world revolves around them after a baby is born.  It's for the new mom and dad to decide when they can visit.  When my first born came into this world, we banned everyone except medical staff from my late wifes room, grandma's included.

Our 9-lb beauty was born healthy and happy. We brought her home after 4 days.
