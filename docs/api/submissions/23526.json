You have this one first chance to make a clear boundary as it pertains to grandma vs mom and dad. It can set the tone for the next 20 years. Draw the line clearly in the sand and enforce it! Im saying this as a mom and a grandmother. This is your child and you and your wife need to make it clear who will make all the decisions for the raising of your child. It won't break her heart, your mom will get over it. If you give her a victory with her assumption of her role in the baby's life, you will end up fighting over everything.

It's about healing, bonding & establishing breastfeeding.", "NTA\n\nAll else aside, she didn\u2019t even ask if she could stay in your home. That\u2019s not okay anytime, let alone during a time of high stress for you and your wife.\n\nIf grandma can stay with the sister, maybe your mother can too. And if not, she can wait for your call like everyone else.\n\nTell the partner it\u2019s your mother who needs to listen. Or at least ASK in the first place.

This birth is when you, your wife, and your baby become a family. It takes time to recover from childbirth. It takes time to establish a routine with your baby. And the routine will change every week or so as baby grows. It is really good that gestational diabetes goes away as soon as baby is born!  (Granny here who had gestational diabetes with every pregnancy)", "NTA. This show is about the new baby and their parents\u2014- you and your wife. Your mother is being a terrible brat and I hope that she comes to her senses once everything settles. Her heart will probably be FINE the moment she sees that baby. What kind of monster stays angry when there is a baby to cuddle?", "Your mother is being manipulative.  New parents need time to themselves. \n\nShe booked this without talking to you.  She just assumed she could come.   Never make assumptions.\n\nPS - Your wife may give birth before the induction date,  Induction with a possible C section  are very hard to predict what will happen in the short term future.  How much recovery time will your wife need?  Your wife is likely to feel VERY vulnerable after giving birth.  \n\nYou are backing your wife's needs.  Stand strong.  She and the new born are the most important people shortly after birth.  Your mothers needs (demands) are secondary.  She can stay in a hotel.", "NTA - Keep protecting your wife from your well meaning but extremely overreaching mother.", "NTA. Trust me with every fiber in your being that after a c-section and birth your wife will not want houseguests for several days. Don\u2019t let them bully you. Just by the way they\u2019re acting now I can see it would be horrific.", "NTA. She didn't ask, simple as that. She assumed she could stay over without asking simply because she is your parent.\n\nShe needs to understand boundaries better and the simple rule of asking before doing.", "OP offer a week if possible and absolutely refuse to answer the door and stick to your stance with it too, because you don't need to add your stress to your wife's because her psyche is going to be beyond fragile during this time in the worst case scenario and your mother isn't going to alleviate it but likely worsen it.  It's obvious from her partner's involvement because he's likely going to insert himself even after the baby's arrival.  I would also recommend trying to even temporarily blocking their phone numbers at least on your wife's phone so she can avoid the stress so you can help eliminate her stress.  There's nothing worse than dealing with a mother's guilt, but your wife's health is what's paramount at this time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
