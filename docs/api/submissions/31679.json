Even at this age I have a mom that clearly has no respect for boundaries and this time I\u2019ve had enough.\n\nOne of the first things mom did after I had taken a shower when coming home for Thanksgiving was her comment on me \u201clooking bloated\u201d. She always does this whenever I visit and I initially tried to sidestep the issue, but she persisted; at some point I simply just said to her that I really don\u2019t appreciate the comments; I simply had had an energy drink earlier that morning.\n\nShe then apologised to me yesterday morning before Thanksgiving festivities, but later made similar comments about my hair. I\u2019m a brown dude and my hair texture and structure can be rather difficult to work with; I unfortunately learnt that the hard way when I went to get a haircut by a barber near my uni and it looked okay at first but turned out to be rather uneven. I initially didn\u2019t say anything to send the message I\u2019m not interested, but she persisted.\n\nThen earlier this morning, while I was still sleeping nonetheless, she barged into my room and told me she wanted to make me an appointment for my hair to be fixed. She then did this again because grandma randomly showed up to have me fix her laptop\u2026 it was a dead simple fix.\n\nShe then took me to the hair stylist and I had told them what I wanted, but they didn\u2019t speak English as a first language and I had trouble parsing what they were saying since they spoke with an accent. It\u2019s not to be offensive, I genuinely don\u2019t know how to parse broken English, which my mom knows for a fact, and it leads to a situation that has me feeling awkward and I want to avoid, so I had to call mom in order to resolve it. At this point after having to defer to mom yet again, I was feeling rather claustrophobic because I had wanted to be on my own and do some research for a final project for lab partners at school, and I couldn\u2019t do that with mom breathing down my neck.\n\nI told my mom I was ready to go back to campus. She asked why, and I laid out the reasons. Instead of accepting them and taking what I said into account, she proceeded to make excuses and say how she \u201cdidn\u2019t intend to do these things\u201d and she\u2019s \u201cjust trying to help\u201d; she does this shit all the time and I\u2019m done. She even started crying about it and I know for a fact it\u2019s her trying to guilt trip me.\n\nI packed some leftovers before mom took me to the train station, asking me to \u201ckeep her promise that I am indeed going back and being truthful\u201d; even if I weren\u2019t, I don\u2019t care, not her call to make.\n\nNow my dad, who is currently out of town due to family obligations, called me and said I shouldn\u2019t have \u201cabandoned\u201d my mom like she did and that she \u201cneeds my help\u201d but discussing this same incident with friends has them saying I was right to distance myself.

In this instance, you fed into them - you went with her to the barber instead of making your own appointment, and you were too nice letting her get away with the bloated comment. How do you think she'd feel if you gave her her own medicine? Probably not great.\n\nYou're worth standing up for - don't let her do this to you. This is the road she paved, but it's time to do you. Of course your dad will call you - she probably nagged him to do so, and he's sick of hearing her go on if I had to take a guess. You're nobody's chore.

I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t care what her \u201creasons\u201d were, every time she had the chance to take her foot out of her mouth and make a genuine connection, she just used it to kick you again.\n\nHope you can find a great job far away. Your Dad covering for her reminds me of this husband I knew that spent 50 years covering for his wife\u2019s behaviour, as soon as he got sick, she stuck him right in a nursing home and never came to visit. Sooooooo, yah.", "NTA. Next time, before you go, set clear boundaries and expectations. Inform your mother that if she does not respect the boundaries and expectations, you will not argue with her -- you will simply stand up, thank her, and call a taxi to the train station.\n\nDon't let her manipulate you, either with the insults or with the tears.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your Mom is verbally abusing you and you don\u2019t deserve that nor do you have to subject yourself to it. Take care of yourself.

It is time you learn how to deal with her. Why did you go with her to the stylist?\n\nFor normal people, you could/should walk away. But with family you have to go the extra mile.", "NTA\n\nMom's behavior is controlling, bordering on toxic.  I don't blame you for wanting to distance yourself from her.\n\nShe should be glad that you come home AT ALL.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your weekend!\n\nHugs", "It's rude, unnecessary and quite honestly invasive for your mom to be judging your body and looks like that. Keep maintaining boundaries with her.", "Seems like someone is throwing a tantrum and nothing more... \ud83d\ude10", "Sounds like she\u2019s a helicopter parent and she can\u2019t let go. lol. Have to admit when my kids were your age, I probably did and said some of the same things. I did them to be a help so they could put their best foot forward. I had to learn to let go and let them be who they were meant to be. They\u2019re in their 30\u2019s now and have built a relationship with me that has firm boundaries. If I want to maintain a good relationship with them, I have to respect their boundaries. Keep doing what you need to do.

Always get away from that nonsense.", "It is verbal abuse and it\u2019s how she controls you. Don\u2019t minimize how totally fucked up your relationship to her is", "I agree that it is toxic. And doing nothing about it leaves the toxin. Why should OP run from problems rather than do something about it? That doesn't sound healthy.", "I\u2019m not trying to minimise things, I genuinely am questioning because I\u2019m realising just how little I know about what genuine parent\u2014adult child interaction looks like", "NTA. It sounds like she doesn't understand boundaries and she hurts you. Something doesn't need to be abusive to be unhealthy. I don't know if I would call this abusive, but I would call it toxic, manipulative, unloving. What you did was remove yourself from an unhealthy situation, which is great. It's ok to do again. When your Mom is kind and loving, great, be around her. But when she is controlling, manipulating, and hurting you, dismiss yourself. It's ok to do that until she learns to respect you more."]}
