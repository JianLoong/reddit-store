The thing is, I had a terrible \"father\" who abandoned me when I was a baby and I'm not gonna try to deny it, that affected me, a lot. I only had two relationships and both were with people old enough to be my father, and I know that has to do with my past because I go to therapy for it. But that doesn't mean that I don't love my husband (55M) or that we have a horrible relationship and that's what, apparently, my friend never understood and that's why she said those things.\n\nShe told another friend that we have in common that my husband disgusts her because he is too affectionate with me and she doesn't like that. That she believes that I cheated on him and that our baby and the one I am expecting are not his but another man's because he is \"too old\" to make babies, that the times I talked about how good he is in bed, I lied because it's not possible for someone his age to be good at that. That I shouldn't have been a mother because I'm \"fucked in the head\" thanks to my father, and that hurt me because she knows how hard I tried to get pregnant and how much i love and protect my baby, and although that hurt nothing hurt me more than knowing that she was using me all this time.\n\nShe  also told our friend that the only thing she likes about being my friend is that my husband has contacts and that makes everything easier for all my friends and family (she said that because thanks to my husband she and her husband have new jobs) and that pissed me off so much that the first thing I did was tell my husband and ask him to tell his brother to fire her and her husband. He talked to his brother and he's going to fire them and that made me feel better because I think it's what she deserved but my mom thinks I was too harsh. that I should have given her another chance because maybe she just had a bad day when she said all that, but I don't think so.

Nepotism has a negative connotation for a reason and anyone who says you \"suck\" needs to realize that actions have consequences.

She got what she deserved and her hubby was collateral damage that she caused.", ">leaving your relationship untouched by petty drama.\n\nWell, mostly untouched.", "So if you got a friend a job with your family, after they said that about you, you would be ok with them still working with your family? A person like that will not hesitate a second to badmouth you to the family as well. What if your family is torn apart by someone like this? And you could have avoided it by cutting it off at the knees?", ">unless it was her job to be a decent human being\n\nLMAO! There are jobs where you don't need to be a decent human being?", "Proving her correct that she is a cheater and her husband is too old to make babies? That's not how that works. The BIL is in a position to fire the friend.  If this \"idle gossip\" was just that, he wouldn't have been so quick to fire them. Something must have already been not sitting right with him.  I don't know where they are, but the US is mostly at will so a wrongful termination would be really hard to pursue. Just like employees can be fired for wearing shirts with political statements on their public FB profiles, a person can be fired for speaking ill of the family member of the upper management/owner. Most employee contracts have \"actions unbecoming\" as a fireable offense.", "If you\u2019re a boss and think at least one person in your team isn\u2019t shit talking you then I have a bridge to sell you.", "Yes, but this has nothing to do with the other husband", "Don\u2019t bite the hand(s) that feeds \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP wasn't feeding the friend", "You mean the boss's brother's wife. But how's that affect her job performance?", "If that is acceptable, then why is it not acceptable to work at her current job?", "How do you know she actually said those things?", "Not arguing that point, it feels fairly justified. I might even have done the same. Doesn't change the fact that it's generally considered aholish to use connections or family to go after someone's job as revenge for a private matter.", "I would let my husband know what\u2019s been said. I wouldn\u2019t demand she be fired, especially her husband who has nothing to do with it. She is well within her rights to mention the falling out and the reasons behind it to BIL, but asking she be fired is taking it a step to far. IMO. \n\nThere is a almost 30 year age gap. If family was going to be torn or cared it would have come out by now. What matters is what her husband believes.", "Proving her correct that OP's husband abuses his contacts. BIL hasn't fired them yet, just said he will, which I imagine will be soon. And if he hired them through nepotism I imagine firing through nepotism will be just as easy so he may not actually have had something \"not right\" sitting with him.\n\nAlso I assume from your comment that you live in the US (especially since your tone implied that everyone does) where nepotism as a wrongful termination offence can apply in public sector, or possibly with an individual or union contract in the private sector. Assuming they live somewhere other than the US, like I do, where I live recognizes nepotism and the hiring / firing around it to be a form of discrimination. So yes they can sue for wrongful termination on the grounds of the SIL of the owner demanding that they be fired because they got into an argument (not saying that's the context but they can frame it that way). But only in the two instances in the US (federally speaking) or if they live in another country. And I never said that they would be successful, though any lawsuit, bogus or not, is a headache to deal with.", ">According to the friend, she only stayed friend with OP because of the \"contacts\" which included OP's BIL.  So yes, OP was \"feeding the friend.\"  Because friend and her husband would not have had \"contacts\" to get the jobs they have.", "True but you don\u2019t go around insulting people who are related to your employers and not expect any consequences for it. Friend was also insinuating that op cheated on her husband to another friend and also that she was using op for her connections. Op is kinda mean for doing that but friend is clearly dumb enough to go around insulting people in the same social circle as op and not expect op to find out.", "Because her husband gave them a recommendation. Based on new information the recommendation is no longer valid. \n\nNTA", "Because it\u2019s a job her husband got her, who she clearly does not respect or care about and seems to have just used for the job? They don\u2019t owe the friend anything. She can go work for someone she actually respects and cares about because apparently it\u2019s not op nor her husband. Op doesn\u2019t owe her anything.", "The brother is the one who seems to have the hiring & firing power. Am I really to believe that her, as SIL, has so much power that her BIL would fire them on the spot? There is more than this story than meets the eyes. The fact that OP's friend is complaining about his affection level and accusing her of cheating makes it clear that she is not beyond saying that about other people. What is there to keep her from accusing OPs husband of sexual harassment or OP of sleeping with her man? This woman is extremely untrustworthy and as just a \\*random\\* person, I wouldn't want to be anywhere next to this woman as just a co-worker. I will agree, that OP is the AH for not confronting her before asking for her to be fired. But the BIL not saying \"woah woah, she's a good employee, let's sit down & talk this one through\" is the most telling thing of this story.", "It\u2019s the fuck around and find out syndrome that seems to be going around - I agree with what you posted. If it came out to my boss that I was insulting her family, I no longer would have a job. Same scenario here.", "well i mean you shouldn't insult people period. but why would you expect the consequences are to be fired? I've talked shit about coworkers behind their back before, I've been told about negative gossip others have mentioned about me. I don't expect to get fired for it.", "k", "Nothing suggests they were only friends in order to get the job.  Your imagination is going wild with the worst case scenario. and even IF the friend didn't care about OP, that doesn't mean she doesn't respect OP's husband's brother. OP also got the friend's husband fired who has nothing to do with all this.", "Do you talk shit about your bosses wife/sister in law?", "I\u2019ve talked shit too. But I would never talk shit about a boss\u2019 relatives to friends in the same circle and expect it to not get back around to op and not get fired. Friend doesn\u2019t only insult op but is also insulting her husband who is her employer\u2019s brother. Friend fucked around and found out.", "He lives with a nasty, vindictive, evil lying woman that slandered her friend and her friend's husband after they got she and he a job.  To hell with them.", ">Nothing suggests they were only friends in order to get the job. \n\nthe friend literally said she only is friends with her because of her connections. so yes, nothing SUGGESTS it her words clearly and blatantly SPELL IT OUT.", "I don't know any of my boss's family, I've certainly talked shit about my boss. Why do you ask?", "But do you feel that's deserved or justified?", "Aren't you judgemental. All that from a single one sided story you heard on Reddit.", "Her words of the friend\u2019s words? What makes this person so credible?", "Somewhat. I think the friend being fired is justified. Ideally, Friend\u2019s husband should have kept his job if he is qualified since he most likely does not share his wife\u2019s opinions.", "NTA.  Friendships should be equal partnerships and I do not see anything balanced here. If she doesn't like you and your husband then fuck her!", "INFO: did you verify that she even said these things? Or did you hear second hand that she did and fly off the handle?", "NTA. Kick her to the curb!", "No. They\u2019re not your friends. It might be illegal to fire both of them without a reason but that depends on what state you live in.", "NTA\n\nYIKES! She is not your friend. You are having therapy to deal with your father issues.\n\nYour relationship with your husband is none of her business, and it is very unkind to say the things she has been saying.", "Kind of harsh but IF true a prudent measure", "If they were great employees, I doubt if they would be getting fired over this.", " NTA this woman is both toxic and indiscreet. Good riddance.", "INFO: did you confirm she said these things? It wasn\u2019t your other friend making things up or exaggerating?\n\nI\u2019m asking because I had friends who did this exact thing, talk bad behind my back. Friend A told me they had been doing this for a long time. I talked to my friends and found out the supposed backstabbers were innocent and the actual backstabber was friend A. We kicked her out of the group.", "NTA\nhowever i wouldn\u2019t of out the husband fired unless you know for sure he said shit like this? \nbut this friend has badly slandered you \ud83e\udd14", "NTA but are you sure you\u2019re 29 and 28? Jeez this is some high school level stuff.", "ESH", "Right sounds more like jealousy to me NTA", "Agreed. Op is NTA. That\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles. \nAnd Happy Cake Day to you!!\ud83c\udf70\ud83c\udf88", "If they were stellar employees, they wouldn't be getting fired for this. My guess is they're more hangers-on, and couldn't be fired because the business is doing a favor for the OP's husband. Now that they don't have to worry about the favor anymore,  they can get rid of the dead weight.", "Exactly and can\u2019t they sue for wrongful termination if they can prove that she had them fired over a personal issue that had literally nothing to do with their jobs or the quality of their work? That\u2019s playing with fire isn\u2019t it? It could really affect him and his company.", "It may not be a fireable offense but 1. At will employment can be terminated at any time for any reason 2. If you've been around long enough, companies will look, and find, any reason to get rid of you.", "Sounds like a great tool for her old husband to use. She clearly enjoys the power trips", "You keep posting emotions instead of facts. Businesses don\u2019t need to be involved in peoples emotional business, it\u2019s a slippery slope. Both these people are immature assholes"]}
