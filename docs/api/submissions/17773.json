She wasn\u2019t really wearing them anymore and said I could have them for an indefinite period of time, but that she'd want them back eventually.  \nI wore some of the clothes at first, but eventually stopped wearing most of it. She never brought it up or asked to get the clothes back at any point in the last 2 years, so I honestly forgot that they were hers as they were just sitting in my closet, untouched.  \nA couple of months ago, I was clearing out my closet and gave away the clothes (since I wasn't wearing them). Today, she asked for them back. I told her that I had given them away since I hadn\u2019t worn any of it in well over a year and had genuinely forgotten that it was hers. She's understandably upset, and I feel awful. AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I didn\u2019t remember that they were her clothes when I gave them away, otherwise I would\u2019ve asked if she wanted them back and returned them if that\u2019s what she wanted. I would never knowingly give away something that belongs to someone else. \n\nWe talked it out and she understands that it was an honest mistake. There was one specific item of clothing she really wanted back which I found a replacement for and already ordered for her. Neither of us remember the specifics of the other items which makes replacing them more difficult, but she said she only really cared about that one item.", "created_utc": 1684607164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13n2a88/aita_for_giving_away_my_sisters_clothes_after_2/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she eventually wanted them back, what you did is borrow them. They were not yours to give away.

It was a genuine mistake that you forget the clothes were hers, but she has every right to be upset that you gave away some things that were hers.", "YTA- you owe your sister some clothes", "Yes, sorry to say YTA.  It was an honest mistake, sure, but that doesn't change that you threw away stuff you'd agreed to give back.", "yta, she told you that she would want them back eventually.", "Yes, YTA for borrowing things and not returning them. It's also a bit suspicious that you have multiple excuses teed up, when it's truly just a matter of keeping your word. \n\nSomehow, it's supposed to be okay, because you stopped wearing them for a long time but didn't return them? Nothing stopped you from returning them without being asked. Also, you forgot they were hers and gave them away, but knew about the clothes in question right away when asked? It's just kinda weird. \n\nDid you give them away or did you sell them? What was the value of the items you failed to return?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're obviously in the wrong but it was am honest mistake, you know you fucked up, you feel bad, you apologized and are trying to make it right.

You either owe her new clothes or compensate her for the money the clothes were valued."]}
