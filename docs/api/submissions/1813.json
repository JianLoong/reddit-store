While there are some people who would associate those completely separate events, you are not the result of their infidelity, or you would be an affair child. But, their divorce was. Anyone blaming you, in the past, present, or future for your existence messing up a happy family has their own issues. And it sounds like that describes your mom's older son. Which is probably why she is telling you he was young and had issues.\n\nBUT, just because he had issues, doesn't mean you are in any way obligated to sit down with him and give him permission to feel better about treating you like crap during your childhood. You don't ever have to face him again.\n\nAnd if he is serious about that public apology, he could still do it, he could state 'I wish my younger brother was here, I know why he isn't, I treated him horribly during his childhood because of something beyond his control. And I had a great relationship with the person who had control over the situation. As a child, I behaved childishly. I behaved in a way I would never want my children to behave toward anyone else, even if they had good reason to deserve it. I treated my brother, who didn't deserve it, in such a way that my shame grows daily for it. All I can do is atone for it however I am able to, and hope that the damage I did as a kid to him during his childhood didn't scar him and cause problems for him for the rest of his life. Because he deserves better. One-year-old him deserves better, five-year-old him deserves better, 15-year-old him deserves better, and the young man he is today definitely deserves better. And while I wish he were here to let me say this to him, I understand why he isn't. And maybe one day he will be ready to hear me.\"\n\nBut it's not for him, or your mom, or anyone else, to decide when or if you are ever ready to hear it.\n\nAs for the statement you made to your mom, it's clear it is still coming from a place of pain. While your mom and dad are upset about it, I am sure on some level they understand.\n\nNTA", "The only reason for him to publicly apologize - if that was actually his intent - is to put pressure on you to \"accept\". This is for his own benefit, not yours. \n\nIf he wants to apologize, he can do it privately. \n\nNTA", "> he has changed and wanted to apologize to me\n\nOk, then he can do that, but it doesn't have to be during your event. If he cant be bothered to reach out and apologize before, he can fuck off.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  If he\u2019s sorry for how he treated you, he could write you a letter, or just tell you *himself* that he wants to apologize instead of randomly inviting you to stuff like you\u2019re supposed to pretend you have a normal sibling relationship, let alone trying to drag you into some weird public show of remorse.  And even then, you\u2019re under no obligation to give him a chance when nothing in your entire experience of dealing with him has primed you to expect anything good.  He\u2019s spent your whole life building this rift, and he\u2019s going to have to live with it.", "Older brother may be repentant, but being apologetic doesn't entitle you to forgiveness. Older brother needs to accept that he was a massive asshole and find a way to apologize to you remotely and accept that its up to you to decide if you want to let him in.\n\nSucks for your mom and her image of a perfect family, but she's the one most at fault for setting up this situation here. Her tears are, hopefully, ones of guilt and self reflection. But I'd expect its more a pity party.\n\nEnjoy your day with the family you choose, and don't back down. Your feelings are valid, and you don't have to defend them. You only have to assert them boldly and proudly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to bully you and then demand a stage to apologize.

But it's not what he is interested in.", "NTA - The poor behaviour might have happened when he was a child but he's had 13 years to rectify it and apparently hasn't. You owe him nothing.

Good luck.", "NTA. I would've said it more nicely, but at the end of the day, it's up to you if you want to accept him in your life.", "NTA.

Remember that you don't owe anybody forgiveness, especially after the way they treated you.", "NTA. I wish people will stop expecting those who have been bullied/abused to forgive their tormentor.

Now OP is standing up for herself and removed someone from her life who caused her pain. Her family has to stop pushing her.", "NTA she didn't force him to have a relationship with you years ago but she's now forcing you to have a relationship with him. Probably out of guilt but that burden isn't yours to bear.", "NTA. While it\u2019s understandable that your Mom wants you to have a good relationship with your half-brother, you aren\u2019t obligated to invite him because of your mom. He treated you terribly and hasn\u2019t apologized. It\u2019s your graduation and your choice on who gets attend, not your mom\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s. If you don\u2019t want him there, then he shouldn\u2019t come. The whole purpose of the event is to celebrate you and your accomplishment.", "Maybe you were rude, but you are in the right.

It\u2019s your graduation, you invite who you want. He only wants to apologise to make himself feel better, not you. \n\nTake it from the Bojack horseman episode (weird reference I know but it makes sense). If someone is an asshole to you, you don\u2019t have to forgive them. They can live with the shitty thing they did.", "Nta. It\u2019s your call. Your mom says he wants to apologize, well has he?

Big hug!", "Absolutely NTA! You aren\u2019t required to forgive, even if he had already apologized. Your dad is kinda right about it being a bit rude, as it appears you yelled at your mom over this, but sometimes being rude is the only way to get your point across.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s up to you when (and if) you decide to forgive and contact him again. Your mother\u2019s infidelity was not your fault, but he took it out on you instead of the actual person who was at fault: your mother. It\u2019s fine that he wants to apologize. Good for him. If he is really genuine, he won\u2019t push this but wait until you are ready. And it\u2019s a little too late for your mother to be trying to be mending fences - the damage has been done.", "You're not required to let someone who abused you back into your life- regardless of if they change, apologize, etc.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s changed, he used you as his punching bag and although your parents recognized what he was doing and how it was affecting you, they didn\u2019t stop it. You do not have to forgive him if you do not want to, that is your choice and your choice only. Mom can cry all she wants, but this is your choice and she\u2019s gonna have to suck it up. Also, publicly apologizing on your kids birthday? If he truly felt remorseful, he would have owned up to what he has done to you all those years and apologize to you privately, not in a public setting that would draw unnecessary attention. This isn\u2019t playing favorites, this is getting a taste of his own medicine and him learning just how bad his actions can affect his relations.", "Your mom says he \"wants to apologize,\" but has he ever apologized?  Has he ever sent a note or a text or anything that says \"I was a jerk and I feel bad about it.  I'd like to apologize to you\"?  The idea of a public apology always makes me a bit uncomfortable because it seems that the purpose is to put you in a position of being forced to *publicly accept* that apology regardless of whether things are in any way mended. \n\nYou went a little bit overboard with stating that you only have two siblings, but you're certainly not out of line to only be inviting people who have been supportive of you and who have given you reason to believe in their love for you to your graduation.  \n\nSo, drop the wording about how many sibs you have and just make reference to \"people who have supported me as I reached this milestone\".  Don't rub this in your mom's face as it's clear that she wishes she had done things to make it possible for you to have a relationship with her eldest, but also be true to yourself and don't feel you have to manufacture love for someone you don't love.\n\nOne last bit of advice, when your mom's eldest invites you directly, he's trying to make things a little better and probably does indicate that he wants to nudge a door open to you one day having at least a civil and hopefully friendly relationship.  Maybe go - just as you might go if your roommate's best friend invited you along to a gathering, not because you love them or feel an obligation to them but just because someone invited you to join in a happy day.  It might turn out well - and if it doesn't, you can remember another obligation and leave.\n\nAlways be true to yourself, but try to allow others to have room for change and growth.", "NTA - How would you feel about an apology letter? If you\u2019re open to it, your mom could tell him that you\u2019d accept a letter if he truly wants to apologize. Not that you need to accept an apology\u2026but it takes the pressure off having to see him to get it. He definitely owes it to you.", "NTA and he doesn't want to apologize, he wants to make mom happy. If he wanted to apologize he'd drive his ass over and apologize not ask you to attend an event to 'show' everyone how sorry he was and that you are now the AH for not accepting. GTFO with that AH brother, don't apologize and if mom can't handle it let her know she does not need to attend either as you only want people there that love, support, and respect you.", "NTA - You are not obligated to forgive people. It does seem like the problems all happened 13+ years ago when he was a child himself. But you were also a child. You can decided whether or not to have a relationship with him.", "NTA\n\nIf he really wanted to apologize he would have taken some form of initiative on his own behalf. Not have your mother be the go between. If it\u2019s that big of a deal he can send a letter with what he wants to say. \n\nPublic apologies are just theatre for the person apologizing and puts the other person in a no-win situation.

Invite the people you consider your siblings and enjoy your day!", "NTA. Basically what I read from this is he was a bully and made your life miserable. The bully does not get to decide \"oh water under the bridge\". That is not their place. He wants to apologize? Great do it in private without expectations of being forgiven and make damn well sure it's heartfelt. You do not do it a public place with everyone watching to create social pressure for the apology to be accepted. \n\nAlso as for the rude part, could it have been handled better? Possibly, yes.

She and your dad did a HORRIBLE AND TRAUMATIC thing to her other child\u2019s family. He WAS a child and unfairly took it out on you\u2026because kids do that. This is their fault and honestly? The blame solely lies on them. THEY are the reason you don\u2019t have another brother.
