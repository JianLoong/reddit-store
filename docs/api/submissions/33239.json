She was my wild child. Since she started walking she was climbing trees and terrorizing the wildlife. She would come in completely covered head to toe in dirt and debris every day. As a teenager she was rebellious. I was constantly worried I'd get a call that she was dead or in jail. She moved out when she was 18 and was determined to never need our help. \n\nAs an adult she is mature and responsible. She has a master's degree in business and is over a hospital and a couple of doctors offices. She met her husband (33) when she was 21 and those two were perfect for each other. They own a farm and have a set of triplets ( they had infertility problems). \n\nThey have never once asked for money or really needed any help from us at all. Maybe to baby sit every now and then but that's about it. Those two just have it all put together. \n\nMy youngest (27) lives in a camper trailer with her husband. They have 5 children and she is pregnant again. They also have several cats and dogs. Both work but both have low paying jobs. Both refuse to do more. I gave her just as much as her sister to go to college. She chose not to and spent it all. It seems like every week they need money for something. We pay most of their bills ( power, water, car insurance, phones, etc). I don't want my grandchildren living in the dark so I pay. \n\nRecently my husband and I did our will and named out eldest executor of estate. We both have some serious health problems so we figured it was time ( honestly we should have done it sooner but better late than never). Our eldest didn't say anything about the money and mostly just asked questions about what we want her to do, how we want funerals and if we wanted to be buried or cremated, what to do with the estate, etc. The normal end of life stuff. \n\nWe ( my husband and I) divided out inheritance and our eldest got most of it. My reasoning is our youngest has used all of her inheritance in the money we are constantly having to give her. I did divide out my jewelry equally and several other items for them and when we pass they are to sell our home and equally split it. \n\nWell this has caused a huge issue with my youngest who believes I am favoring her sister. I don't believe so. Her sister has simply not needed any of her inheritance and is the more responsible of my daughters. I know when the time comes she will know what to do and will do what is necessary for everything. \n\nMy youngest has decided to no longer speak to me so I am trying to figure out if I am being an Ahole.", "created_utc": 1702852229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kt5ay/aita_for_not_splitting_our_estate_equally_between/", "score": 1337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are allowed to divide your estate as you see fit. It is not at all unusual for a person to divide their estate unequally, for many reasons. I guess the youngest figured the gravy train would keep coming; but you are spending her part of the estate now, as you explained. \n\nI would reconsider continuing to pay her now though; what if your deaths aren't imminent, as you think? Do you want her to drain your estate?\n\nYou are wise to let them know this in advance. Double check with a lawyer that the will can't be challenged.", "I\u2019ll bet she starts speaking to you as soon as the next bill she can\u2019t pay shows up. It\u2019s your choice to divide your estate as you choose. No one is owed anything and your younger daughter might just be a little too comfortable with getting her \u201cinheritance\u201d up front. She\u2019s chosen her life and it\u2019s not up to you to pay for her choices, now or in the future. If you\u2019re comfortable with your decision, that\u2019s all that matters. NTA.", "I was the youngest daughter.  I graduated from college and had a good job that I liked. Then married a guy that was NOT a knight in shining armor but a loser in tin foil.\n (Figured that out years later). We had 2 kids in 17 months. One was special needs. I worked 2 jobs. He couldn't or wouldn't keep a job to save his life. \n\nHe ran up huge credit card debts to the point we had to declare bankruptcy; he took our house payment $$ and gambled. We lost the house.\n\nYou get the picture. My parents bailed us out for the children's sake more than once. They have told me I already had my inherentance. And, TBH, I wasn't even mad about it because it's true.  \n\nWish I'd ditched the loser years earlier  but I truly loved him till it just wore me down; doing everything by myself.  \n\nMy point OP, is you are not TA. Your daughter is probably a mix of angry and embarrassed.  At least I was when I had to ask for help. \n\nIn speaking from experience, lay some boundaries and stick to it. Why WOULD they change if you bail them out over and over? I was horrified but my then husband had no shame. He'd rather ask my parents for money than work.", "NTA\n\nIf you're the one who's been paying your youngest daughter's bills all this time, then yes, that right there is her inheritance.\n\nIt's not like you're even giving your oldest daughter everything. They'll each get some keepsakes and half the proceeds from your house. Plus it sounds like your oldest is going to be dealing with the after-life things, so honestly to me it just seems fair.", "NTA. Maybe you could try and estimate all the money you\u2019ve spent on your younger daughter and itemise it in a way that demonstrates an equal split. Also make sure you do your will with a proper solicitor (and not a diy or internet will) as I think your daughter will try and fight your other sister in court for a larger payout", "NTA\n\nYou have provided help for your immature and irresponsible daughter for much of her adult life. You are 100% correct, she has already spent a vast majority of her inheritance by taking money from you as often and as much as she has. \n\nShe has a low paying job and refuses to change all while refusing to stop having kids.... Who does that?!?! Why in the hell would anyone want to live in a trailer with SIX kids and multiple animals?!?!\n\nA little advice.... Make sure your oldest daughter knows you want the house sold. I wouldn't be shocked if youngest tries to talk oldest into letting her have the house for her family when you're gone.", "NTA\n\nWhile sitting up our Living Trust for our children the question of one being a \"spendthrift\"  was a recurring topic.  It is a reality many families face.\n\nNot sure if y'all looked into a Living Trust but its an excellent way to protect your wishes and its when set up correctly, its very hard to contest in court.  Your \"spendthrift\"  sounds like someone who might contest the will.  It also takes a lot of pressure off your daughter.\n\nGood Luck, its not fun.  Been there done that.", "INFO: Did you show them both an accounting of how much the younger sister has already received so that she can see herself whether your division of the estate is fair?", "It may not make a difference, but you could put together a document of all the money you've given your younger daughter, compared to what the eldest will possibly  inherit.\n\nThere's no guarantee she'll inherit a lot anyway. Assuming you're in the US, one severe or prolonged illness could wipe out both their inheritences.", "NTA \n\nShe received her inheritance while you are living. While I don't believe its necessary to go to college to make good money, it does require a work ethic  and some level of ambition.", "In general, you should treat your children equally.\n\nIn this case you are.  Your youngest child is constantly asking you for money and is dependent on you to pay many of their bills.\n\nInheritances should not be expected.  You and your spouse could spend it all down.  Health care in the US can be very expensive.\n\nIf youngest daughter wants to cut you off, let her.  Stop paying her bills.\n\nNTA", "NTA -- but I would give a list to the younger DD as to what you have spent on her.", "NTA. You can ask her if she wants you to continue helping her or save her inheritance for later. She can't have it both ways.\n\nPersonally, I think you are doing her no favors by supporting her the way you do. It gives her no incentive to stand on her own two feet. Our job as parents is to make sure they can survive without us. What is she going to do when you are gone?\n\nIt's hard when kids are in the mix, but maybe she'd rise up if she knew you weren't going to be there. Go ahead and support her for things that will get her ahead, like her education (maybe trade school?) or childcare so she can get a job.\n\nAnother thing you might consider is giving the share that would have gone to her to her children's college fund, because she sure as heck hasn't set one up for them.", "NTA.  Your reasons for splitting the estate the way you are strike me as sound, and you are not attempting to manipulate your children from beyond the grave.  \n\nThat said, I have an alternate suggestion.  Given your younger daughter's circumstances, her children are going to have a tough time getting started in life.  You may wish to place your estate (or a portion thereof) into a trust or trusts that will pay for  your grandchildren to go to college.  I suggest discussing this with your older daughter (not your younger) to see if she is comfortable administering such a trust, and if she is not, then designate someone trustworthy to administer the trust.", "I hope your you used a lawyer for the wills and I also hope your wills contain language that explains your reasoning for the unequal distribution of the estate.  That is helpful (in this jurisdiction, anyway) in the event one sibling seeks to vary the will after you and your spouse are worm food.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money to do with as you wish.\n\nAs others have suggested, maybe itemise what's been spent so the younger daughter knows. I think the amount could come as a big shock.\n\nGet a lawyer if you haven't already to ensure she can't challenge the will via alleging undue influence etc from your older daughter.", "Put everything in writing. If you want the property sold put in writing. If there are family heirlooms to be given put it in writing. What to do with any vehicles put it writing. If it is writing there is no doubt what you want done and the executor will have a firm path of disposal. Leave no room for doubt", "NTA. Your money, your choice, as someone said.  You don't get to be upset that her choice is to have nothing to do with you. You also need to ensure that your oldest is okay taking care of your husband and you in your last moments.", "This is the way my family has always done it. I\u2019ve gotten my share when some of my family were alive and after the rest of them pass, I don\u2019t expect the remainder to be split between my brother and I, I expect him to get all of it.", "I was so scared you were going to say you were giving it to your youngest because she \u201cneeds\u201d it more", "NTA - Your money your choice", "Ur not the ass. Ur youngest is taking it personally but u explained ur reasoning and the money has already been spent on her. U can't control that. Plus, if ur eldest hasn't needed any help, then y should she get equal inheritance? Keep doing what u think is best for ur family and don't let one daughter's hurt feelings dictate everything.", "NTA. You can divide your estate however you want.  Put pencil to paper for the younger daughter and put that accounting in with your will.  It just might turn out the more stable daughter is actually getting less in the long run.  Your younger daughter chose her life and you have been generous so far.  Apparently she feels a bit entitled.", "NTA. The youngest has used you as an atm and will produce more kids she can\u2019t afford as long as the money is flowing from you. She needs to know that this is her inheritance and it is a finite amount. What is she going to do - if she doesn\u2019t talk to you , how will she pay her next bill ? It is great that you are being fair with the children. Usually the lazy good for nothing kid is favored and the responsible kid is punished for being too successful by cutting off their inheritance.", "As I was reading, I thought to myself that you should be keeping track of how much you spend on your younger daughter, so that you could give your older daughter that amount on top of the inheritance split.\n\nAnd it sounds like that's what you did. Kudos for being a fair parent, and for not showing any favoritism.\n\nIt's sad that your daughter is too entitled to recognize that fairness, but ultimately that's her problem, not yours. \n\nI don't know how much rational thought you can expect from someone living in a trailer and working on their sixth kid they can't afford, though. If she wants to cut you out of her life after all the help you've given her, then maybe you're better off.\n\nNTA.", "Nta for doing with your money what you want but why are you at all surprised that your daughter is angry?\nWhy did this even need to be announced except to somehow punish your daughter?\nWhy did this pot need stirring?", "Was the youngest not a college type kid? Like college wasn't the right setting for her. Or is she flat out refusing to try anything to better herself? Not looking for better pay or anything?", "NTA", "NTA.  It's your estate so it's your decision.  This way of splitting it is actually equitable.  Your younger daughter has \"pre-spent\" a lot of her portion of an equal split.  Her poor decisions (including having kids she can't support) should not mean that she's entitled to more money than her sister.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a tough position to be in, but your reasoning is sound. You know the one daughter that didn\u2019t expect this will use the money wisely to make her family\u2019s future more secure - perhaps a college fund for her kids or something practical and longer term.\n\nThe other will likely use it to continue to get by and stay her current state of poverty - regardless if you give her $25k or $100k. I know this because she sounds much like my own sister in many ways.\n\nAnyway - your money, your kids, your decision.\n\nOne potential thing to consider is if you have a larger place, perhaps give that to your youngest so she can have space for her kids and then give the rest to your oldest. (Probably doesn\u2019t really work out, but just a thought).", "You are definitely NTA.  Your youngest had the same opportunities to get a good education and better herself.  She chose not to and has leeched off you for years.  She has burned through her share of any inheritance so only has herself to blame.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure you will be hearing from your daughter a lot sooner than you think, she is going to need you to keep the electricity on for all of her kids.", "NTA. You had to decide which daughter you were more willing to offend. You could have been \"fair\" by giving equal shares to each even though you've given far more help to your younger daughter already.\n\nOr you could set it up so that some portion (maybe even a majority) of your estate goes into a trust that benefits your grandchildren in equal shares and skips your daughters.", "I have found that whatever their goals or circumstances, being fair (which sometimes means giving each what they need not necessarily the same thing) avoids the feelings of favoritism.  I feel like this whether one has a much higher paying job, etc. because I feel like giving one a lot more \u201cbecause they need it\u201d still feels unfair like they are being punished for doing well or the other rewarded for coasting a bit as well as that i have  made clear that I got them through college with no debt and they shouldnt \u201ccount on\u201d an inheritance (as that expectation seems to lead to resentment if things dont turn out as they wished or imagined) .  That being said, when they have needed large assistance (down payment on a house for example), if I wasnt gifting the other an equivalent amount then I was clear that it was \u201cpart of their inheritance\u201d and that the other would receive the equivalent later or when allocating whatever I have left.  \n\nSo, I do think it is better to be upfront with that so expectations dont lead to disappointment/resentment, so perhaps instead laying out what has been already spent on the one receiving less and explaining that it would be unfair not to provide the same support for her sister would help; presenting it as this IS equity (and perhaps even considering everything she may even be ahead).   NTA.", "Due to your reasons I believe you did the correct thing. No matter how much help you give the youngest she keeps making bad choices.", "Your younger daughter will always think you're the asshole.  How else is she supposed to feel.  I get your reasoning and you're not unjustified.... But the feelings are going to be hurt no matter which way you slice it.  Do what you're heart says.", "Why tell them what you\u2019re going to do? What possible benefit does it achieve by telling them what you intend to do? You leave instructions for the executor and a will. All you have achieved is to make one daughter very unhappy. So YTA.", "NTA\u2026 how about setting up a trust for your youngest daughter\u2019s children, only for college at age 18, or they can get the whole thing at 22 or another age?", "YTA\n\nYou should divide it equally. Her annoyance is understandable. It's not that hard to get it.", "YTA not only are you creating animosity between your youngest and yourselves but also between them which will last long after you\u2019re gone", "Yta. But not for disinheriting your daughter.\n\nCan u not set up a college trust where half of your assets are held for your grandchildren which has your good daughter as an executor. \n\nTherefore bad daughter can\u2019t get the funds but you are not punishing the children and at least giving them a shot.", "YTA. I understand that your daughter makes bad decisions but you should still try your best to help her. Her children especially don't deserve to suffer because of her bad decisions. You should split your estate equally and put her half in a trust that pays out monthly. That way she can't blow it but she'll get help paying her bills", "YTA.

His specific words to me were \u201cI\u2019ve spent all their share on bail money, lawyers, cars, and rent.\u201d My siblings don\u2019t speak to me, but that happened years before he died and I\u2019m glad they don\u2019t.

But the choices you make in the will will have ramifications for your daughters, your grandchildren, and THEIR relationships with each other, and I beg you to think about that.\n\nI worked on a will for a woman with six children, one of whom stepped up to care for her in her old age, and the other five did not. (From the outside a couple of the kids seemed like jerks, a couple seemed like they were drowning in their own lives (kids under 3, kids with disabilities, overwhelming job demands), and the \"good\" child in fact had married a really lovely woman who did all the caretaking -- not him.) So she left everything to the \"good\" child and his wife, and left a minimal amount to the other five. I gently advised against this, and she said, \"What do I care? I'll be dead! Good Child and Wife deserve it!\"\n\nWell, in due course, she was dead, and the Good Child got everything, and it absolutely DESTROYED their relationships with all of their siblings and their nieces and nephews. Good Child even tried to redistribute it evenly, but the damage was done, and 3 of his siblings just cut him off completely. People said spiteful things to his wife at family gatherings, saying she was a golddigger who SCHEMED her way into granny's money. \n\nThey cried in my office, and told me that Granny \"rewarding\" them for being the good child had ruined their lives. They weren't allowed to see nieces and nephews that they had known since birth and loved very much; their kids were cut off from cousins and aunts and uncles. It was awful.\n\nThe amount of good she did by \"rewarding\" the good child vastly outweighed the permanent damage she did to her family. (I had suggested she leave the HOUSE to the \"good\" child, who'd done basically all of the upkeep for the last 10 years, and split the MONEY equally -- that'd give the \"good\" child a reward that would make sense to the other children, while probably not creating bad feelings.)\n\nI would rethink, for your daughters' sakes, how you are splitting the estate, and try to minimize the harm you do to your daughters and their families. Would your older daughter say she would rather have the money, or a relationship with her sister?\n\nI know if my parents were considering leaving differential amounts of money to me and my siblings, I would VASTLY prefer to maintain my relationships with my siblings over having inheritance money. My siblings and their children ARE the most important inheritance my parents gave me. No amount of money would be worth being cut off from my nieces and nephews.", "You are absolutely in the right here. Your youngest has burnt through her inheritance already\u2026. Anything you leave her will meet the same fate. If anything I\u2019d suggest you stop paying her bills, I understand you\u2019re protecting your grandchildren but they won\u2019t be motivated to make ends meet themselves if you keep subsidizing them, and as the theme of this issue goes, you\u2019re not always going to be there.", "NTA.  Based on your description of your youngest, she'll squander the money relatively quickly anyways.  However, if I was in your shoes, I'd do it a bit differently.  I'd give the younger the majority of the inheritance, but with well defined goals to get it, otherwise after some time period it automatically goes to the oldest (or maybe to grandkids that the parents can't touch).  Basically, give her an incentive to improve her life (and for her kids).  But make it time limited.  If it works, she'll improve herself.  If not, your oldest gets it anyways.", "NTA tally up how much you think you\u2019ve given her.

He felt that I had missed out most of my life because all their energy went to him.  I never felt that at all and asked him not to do it.

I'm not exactly your youngest daughter, but due to choosing to get a PhD my parents have given me more support than my siblings. It was always referred to as a loan and it was always clear it was being kept track of, but it was freely given. I used to stress about owing the money until my dad explained that the loan won't be due but it's a loan against my future inheritance. My parents have said they are happy to give me the money when I need it. The only critique I'd have about your method is it doesn't seem like your expectations and feelings about the money have been clear. Your youngest isn't owed more but I can see it being a surprise that money that she thought was given freely has been a loan on her future inheritance.", " NTA. It's not the kids' money, it's yours to do as you please. However keep in mind the youngest may just switch to begging her big sister for money once you're gone. I'd have a frank conversation about it with both kids before signing that final draft", "Thought this was going the opposite direction.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.\n\nIt is infuriating to see parents take money for my siblings and burn it. Just complete waste. It is not coming out of their inheritance.\n\nI would never treat my children the way my parents treat us.", "NTA.

But also because her reaction shows that she is unappreciative of all that you do for her.", "NTA, but put an accounting in your will of the monies given to both daughters throughout their adulthoods to nail down any lingering doubts about the fairness of the split.  Six kids plus cats and dogs in a camper?  No amount of money can fix that level of idiocy anyway; they'll probably just buy a canoe and a banjo.  Those poor children. Perhaps you could put aside some educational funds for their future if there is enough to go around.  Yikes.", "You're fine.

Maybe her portion should be in a trust of some sort so she gets a monthly amount since she'll just blow anything she gets when you pass away.", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation although our children don\u2019t know how our estate is going to be distributed. One child we have given close to $250k for rehab, psychological support, automobiles, and cash for other medical expenses. When the time comes to split our estate, it will be less the amount already paid out.", "I highly recommend you set up a trust for your grandchildren. Set aside money for their college educations and make sure that your youngest daughter can\u2019t touch a penny of it.", "NTA! I wish more parents were reasonable and holistic thinkers like you. \n\nConsidering the entire situation as a whole   Including how you have already heavily supported your youngest vs less for your oldest and then making the appropriate adjustments is very fair.

It\u2019s your estate to dole out however you see fit. Be that as it may, your logic and reasoning are both sound and well thought out. My GMIL did something similar with her kids. She co-signed, helped pay for, and eventually paid off my MIl\u2019s house while alive with the understanding that when she died my MIL would get nothing of monetary value because she\u2019d already received her inheritance so the rest was left the the remaining siblings. You\u2019re doing the same. \n\nWhat it sounds like to me is that your youngest was counting on a big payday when you pass. And for that, you kind of are the AH. You\u2019ve set up this situation where your youngest has zero initiative and that\u2019s probably partly if not largely due to your enabling her. You\u2019ve enabled her to do the bare minimum and keep popping out kids she can\u2019t afford. Why wouldn\u2019t she expect that to continue when you\u2019re gone? You need to start with some boundaries when she decides to contact you again because bills need paid. You are not an atm and allowing her to treat you like one has led to this crossroads.", "NTA.  I was worried this was heading in the other direction.  My grandmother did the same thing you are doing.  My bio dad spent so much of her money while she was alive that he got a lot less when she died.  Which is what he deserved and what is fair.  My uncle very rarely asked for help, so he's he deserved more and he got it.   Bio dad was mad but he got over it.", "NTA- she\u2019s getting hers now.  Her not speaking to you just shows how spoiled she has become unfortunately.  Definitely make sure a lawyer goes over things specifically so she can\u2019t challenge the will.", "NTA and if you actually give your daughter any money it will be blown away before you know it.

Five children and counting!", "NTA, you may distribute your money however you'd like. \n\nLike others have said, live can take many turns and it makes sense to provide for your eldest daughter even if she is doing well, because you never know when her fortunes may turn. On the same merits, realistically you have to weigh your younger daughter's penchant for mismanagement with your concern that she may not be able to support herself in case of an emergency (medical issues for her and her children). That's all ultimately up to you.\n\nI would like to offer some arguments for not providing an accounting to your daughter, as others have suggested. It's possible to do, if you feel this knowledge would change your decision, but I do not think this accounting will ever change your daughter's mind and may in fact give her ammunition or grievance to question your will.", "Dont worry, she will start speaking to you ad soon as a bill doesnt get paid! NTA. I\u2019ve done the same with my kids. Everybody got a certain amount to better their life, whether that was college or a down payment on a home or a trip across the world. One of my kids never used his money. So he will get that when I kick the bucket. The others that spent theirs can kick rocks as far as I\u2019m concerned.

I worked hard and am now in a good financial position. I don\u2019t care one bit about an inheritance.

As a result of this outburst, she didn't give any of the proceeds to my brothers and relationship between all the family members has been very much of an arms length nature ever since.

I really do.  \n\nI don't have any siblings, but I'm the eldest of three granddaughters in my family, and my cousins were like my sisters when I was little.  I'm now 38, my cousins are 37 and 32.  Between the three of us, I was the one who didn't use my college fund the way my grandmother wanted me to.  I lived off of it during my twenties until it ran out, then I got a job, and only then did I go to college \u2014 which I paid for myself.  I stopped being my grandmother's favorite for a lot of reasons, but that was one of them.  I'm happy to say we mended our fences before she passed.  The point is, I can empathize with your youngest daughter if she feels like you're favoring her older sister in this situation.  \n\nAnd I'm gonna be real with you, it certainly seems like you *do* favor your oldest.  In your post, your first two paragraphs are basically a love letter to how great and perfect she is in your eyes.  You didn't have anything kind to say about your youngest.  You weren't mean or anything, but you didn't exactly paint her in a very good light.  What was she like as a child?  Why did we need to know that your oldest was your wild child when she was little?  \n\nThat said, I can't blame you for feeling resentful towards her for not having her shit together at this point in her life.  She needs you to pay her bills for her because she and her husband can't afford to take care of themselves and their five-going-on-six children and multiple pets?  \n\n\\[Insert dramatic eye-roll here.\\]\n\nWhether or not you're showing favoritism towards your oldest daughter, your youngest is acting really effing childish.  \n\nFirst of all, she's not entitled to anything you own.  You don't owe either of your daughters anything now that they're both grown-ass adults.  You would be well within your rights to leave all of your money to charity or a random passerby on the street if you felt like it.  I'm not saying you should do that.  \n\nSecondly, you obviously care about both of them, or else you wouldn't be here, worried about whether you're the asshole in this situation.  I don't get the vibe from you that you're just here for validation.  It seems like you really want to be fair.  \n\nThirdly, does she expect you to continue paying her bills while she's not speaking to you?  Does she think emotional blackmail is the best way to get what she wants?  Does she really not see how undignified and utterly inappropriate it is for her to throw a tantrum at you and bite the hand that feeds her?  \n\nMind you, I can't say I blame her if there's more baggage in your relationship than you let on.  Maybe you have a super toxic relationship with her.  Even if she's being a spoiled brat, maybe she's not wrong if you hold it over her head or make her feel like shit for needing your help.  Maybe your relationship with her is more toxic because you're both at fault in different ways.  That doesn't mean she isn't acting entitled, however.  I don't know her side of the story, but it definitely sounds like she's in the wrong.  \n\nLastly, I don't think your reasoning about how to divide your assets is unsound or unfair.  You simply took into account the way your youngest daughter has benefited from your financial support before your death in calculating how she should financially benefit from your death.  \n\nIt leaves a bad taste in my mouth when people argue over inheritances when the ones leaving behind the inheritances are still alive.  I hope your youngest daughter realizes sooner rather than later that you only have a limited time on this earth to love the people you love before they're gone and nothing but a memory.  \n\nI haven't looked through the other comments yet, but I imagine someone has probably suggested that you might consider that your youngest daughter might need it more than your oldest daughter does.  Maybe someone has already pointed out what I'm about to:\n\nYou mentioned that the reason you pay your youngest's bills is because you don't want her children growing up in the dark.  If your oldest daughter doesn't need the money, maybe consider leaving everything to your grandchildren instead.  Perhaps consider taking steps to ensure that your youngest daughter and her husband can't access the money/assets that would go to their children if you and your husband pass away before your grandchildren are grown and mature enough to handle the money responsibly.  I imagine if you're worried about getting your affairs in order, it's probably weighing on you what will happen to them when you're gone.\n\nPlease pardon the prolix response.

It doesn't sound like your oldest will be upset by that.", "My in-laws have bailed out both of my husband\u2019s sisters in their respective divorces to the tune of about 200k each. When the in-laws pass, their estate will be divided evenly 3 ways. It makes me sad for my husband.", "You are getting in the way of a good story dawg!", "As a fellow ADHD-er, any inheritance I received would be gone at the first sight of a new hyperfixation lol But my only inheritance is my step-brother lol", "Sounds like you are comparing apples and oranges here. Putting more money towards a child with special needs who can't help the fact they need extra help is one thing. The parent owes that child assistance. Giving more (when you include the money they are currently getting) to a child and their spouse who made the decisons that lead to their current circumstances and show no intention of improving their circumstances is completely different. That's when you start punishing your other children for being successful", "The youngest is struggling because they refuse to get better jobs, misused their college fund and are having more children/animals than they can properly take care of.", "It is neither fair nor equitable to stand ready to repeatedly give money to a child who is to a large degree responsible for her own neediness.   The OP's daughter is 27, uneducated and on her 6th pregnancy.   Her situation reflects explicit choices on her part, not unfortunate happenstance.   OP has been rewarding her for her bad choices, enabling her to avoid taking responsibility for those choices.   There is nothing *equitable* about that.", "I think it depends on the family member. I was the trustee on my fathers trust, we sat down, talked it all out, he went the lawyer and got it all set up, when he sadly passed everything went smoothly between me and my 2 siblings. Having his exact wishes written down stopped any squabbling there might have been over his estate. I do agree there are sometimes it is better to not have a family member be executor or trustee.", "The fact the older daughter is responsible and thus getting their share after her parents pass (having missed out a lot of the personal time of parents\u2019 help and input) and then gets to be executor which is extra work especially when OP knows there is a issue with how younger daughter feels is such a shitty way to handle this.\n\nThe \u2018extra\u2019 money comes with layers of hassle and the fact there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lawyer involved is gifting the older daughter a family feud as well as you just know she\u2019s expected to handle the funerals and general death admin of these elderly ill parents because younger daughter isn\u2019t managing her life at all.\n\nThat is reinforcing the dynamics right into your last will and testament, ie: the very last statement you wish to make to the world. \u2018My oldest daughter never gave me hassle so she can pick up the pieces now. My youngest we enabled and then when we didn\u2019t have to deal with the long term, we prioritised our children and seem not to have left anything in name or personal touches to our 9 grandchildren.\u2019 That suggests \u2018oh yeah we thought about ourselves and tax bills and did the bare minimum will prep.\u2019\n\nPeople think using a lawyer for this stuff costs a fortune but can often be a few hundred dollars that changes lives more than willing them large sums and a big box of family baggage.\n\nI think YTA for the surprised pikachu that they didn\u2019t see any of this inevitable stuff coming and are going to let it keep going after they die.", "NTA.  She chose this as her life.  She chose to have five kids, and she chose not to go to college.  Every month you give her money.  This isn't going to change unless she changes.  She'll blow through your money and won't be any better off in life.  Plus, it's your money, if you want to donate it all, that's your business.  You don't owe anyone an inheritance, once again it's your money, you earned it, you get to decide where it goes.", "In other words your youngest *chooses* to depend on you.   She didn't want to go to college from high school and she has no interest in bettering *her children's* lives.    Think about it, she could have chosen to attend some training program --LVN/PNA, bookkeeper, etc. -- at a local community college any time after she had kids.  She prefers being a server at Waffle House and leaving the burden of her kids on you.", "Your decision may lower the likelihood that they will have even more children, so you are doing those potential children a service. NTA. I'm sure they'll guilt the hell out of your eldest though.", "My mother gave me more in the estate than my brother because my brother needed more from her during her lifetime. She itemized it with big ticket things and then took it off the top of the inheritance. For example, she paid his debt off, bought him a house, and sent Jim back to  school. All told it was about 100k. She gave me the first 100k to even it up and split the rest.\n\nTry writing down an itemized list like this that you can include in the will. Consider it pre-estate gifts, and show your daughter that she spent her inheritance while you were alive", ">her half\n\nShe doesn't have a half. 100% of it is OP's. Giving it to the grandkids makes a lot more sense than giving it to either daughter. The oldest doesn't need it and the youngest can't be trusted with it. \n\nPut it in a trust for the grandkids. Those five kids the youngest has will need that money far more than either sister, and it'll be a nice boost for the triplets the oldest sister has as well.", "But it doesn't look like they've done an accounting, and my guess is that the younger child probably doesn't know either. All she sees is that she's getting less. You can be technically right in the end and still an AH in how you do things. And I've seen estate dispositions rip siblings apart even when things are more or less equal, forget about when they're not. What she's doing to her children is going to get much, much uglier than it already is. Don't leave a mess for them to deal with when you're gone; deal with it now by giving the older sibling an equal amount and then leave them each half.", "She didn't actually spend her half. OP just decided that \"her half\" was the money that they always give her", "The better option is to ask the youngest if she:\n - wants her power, car insurance, phones and water paid NOW\n - OR if she wants an inheritance (minus those expenses already paid).\n\nThat would hopefully solve the problem in the future.\n\nNTA either way though. This is very fair.", "I'm the eldest in the same scenario in my family.  I already know I will not be upset if I don't have a relationship with the youngest after both my parents are gone.  \n\nAlso, youngest will be mad but will need the oldest too much to cut her off.", "This.\n\nOP, please sit down and line item out how much you have gifted your other daughter, how much you have paid in bills, etc. over the course of her adulthood.\n\nSit down with her and hand her the list of all of her expenses you have paid for totaled up. Keep it up to date and send it to her periodically. keep a copy with your last will and testament.\n\nThat way, your oldest daughter will have a tool if she needs it to contradict whatever crazy crud her younger sister makes up about favortism.\n\nIt might also be VEry revealing to younger daughter to realize how much you guys have spent helping her pay her bills.\n\nIt would 100% be worth sitting her down with that and telling her that when you raised her you did not plan to support her into her adulthood. She has used up money your husband and you had planned to use for other purposes and you have had to withdraw from savings to pay her bills for her. She's made her choices but its time for her to woman up and take personal responsibility for her life and the family she created instead of calling on Mom and Dad to rescue her because neither of them want to work.", "Nah, he doesn't have to divide it evenly just to appease someone who expects it, that's just encouraging entitlement.\n\nMy younger sister died a few years ago. My older sister stopped talking to me for a spell because my sister left me her life insurance from work and she thought she was entitled to it. My dad has structured their estate very specifically so its clear what is mine and what's hers and I'm already anticipating a shit show after he passes.", "Youngest is going to be on the outs with older sister no matter what is in the will. Youngest and her hubby are on their way to having 6 children even though they can't pay their bills. They refuse to behave more responsibly. So what will happen after parents die, if she gets half the estate? There is a good chance that they will go through the money within a number of years. Money can go fast when you are supporting a family of 8. Mom and dad won't be there to pay the power, water, and other bills, so she'll hit up older sis for help. When older sis says \"no\", younger sis will flounce off in a snit. Whether she gets half of the estate or less, she's going to get angry when she isn't bailed out. It's just a matter of time.", "I would still do your will as you see fit. My dad left me more than my brother. I took care of him the last years of his life. My brother couldn't be bothered to visit him in five years.   My brother asked me for property and more of the money immediately after he passed. We are no contact and I don't really care.  Your daughter will most likely piss the money away even if you give her more then beg your oldest for help.", "This is terrible advise. Keeping the peace, even in death? Ew.", "The trust is a good idea.  The elder daughter as trustee is not.  My grandparents did that for my spendthrift uncles with my mom as trustee and it ruined their relationship as my uncles were constantly hounding her for more $ than she could give them under the trust terms.  Have a law firm as trustee instead.", "If the younger sister can\u2019t realize that something\u2019s wrong with using your college money on something reckless, living in a trailer with 5 kids and a sixth on the way, multiple cats and dogs in that trailer, and having your parents pay all of your bills for a long period of time then that\u2019s their problem. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for them.", "Well since the youngest is no longer speaking to OP, I guess they no longer need their bills paid now! It's like they have no common sense.", "I'm also the oldest. However, I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I don't expect to get anything from my family when they pass. The younger two are the favorites, and my family uses money as a control tactic. I refuse to bow down and will suffer through life if need be before going back. My siblings don't speak to me unless they need something as is, so if that's the case, it'll be nothing new for me and welcome relief. \n\n\nThe youngest used her inheritance while you were alive. She doesn't get to have her cake and eat it too. It's ironic that she thinks the oldest is the favorite when she's the one holding her greedy hand out for mommy's money the whole time. Makes sure your will is as iron tight as it can be, so she can't contest it and get more than she's due.", "Same here, similar circumstances, the youngest did indeed blow through every penny and is now broke. And still resentful. \n\nNTA. Do what you think is best, and I think you've done a fine job.", "I'm the oldest; I'm also the one who needs any \"estate\" the least.  My mom has her will set to split everything equally between myself and my hoard of younger brothers... She and I have also already discussed that I have no plan to follow her wishes and will be dispersing my portion equally to my brothers. \n\nNot all families suck.", "NTA. I've already told my middle, chronically unemployed child that I'm spending his inheritance on him now.  He thinks I'm kidding.  I'm not.", "We don't know much about the sisters' dynamics from OP'S post.  If they are very close it is something for the parents to consider.  If the sisters aren't then OP need not consider this.  It really depends on this specific family.", "I\u2019m the youngest. But understand why the oldest can\u2019t. lol his family are assholes.", "Ewww no don\u2019t do this. Listing out every penny you spent on one child is truly not normal and could come across super petty. \n\nAgree with all the other points though", "Again, the parents can do what they want with their money. But if they didn't give the money informing their child it was a loan from her inheritance, they are AHs for springing that on her. I'm a strong believer that giving equal is better for everyone. So give equal in life, and in death. Even if the older child doesn't need anything, a bit extra while they're alive, to even things out, could be great. But as it is they've set up a situation where the child who is sorting through the estate gets more, which is the worst way to do things. They should choose a non-child executor, make the kids equal in life, and then equal by their death. I was a family lawyer and I've seen how ugly sorting through an estate gets when parents pull stuff like this. They are absolutely setting up the kids for a disaster, and that makes them the AHs.", "Yes, no common sense.  Having ANOTHER baby (#6) when they already can\u2019t pay their bills.  I just don\u2019t get people like this.", "Would it be better if the Will did that rather than u inherit and then give to the brothers? How does that impact your lifetime exemption limit?", "It wasn\u2019t a loan from their inheritance. The reason why they didn\u2019t give as much money to her is because of her previous choices and how she lives her life. What if she was a drug addict? Would you still want to give her 50/50? The parents don\u2019t want to give the youngest daughter a bunch of money because she doesn\u2019t spend it responsibly and it\u2019s all going to go to waste. Rather then the oldest child, who spent their money and time responsibly.", "I received nothing when my dad passed away, 8 years ago, and my grandparents have all passed during my lifetime with nothing but a few heirlooms to pass... My husband inherited and inherits from his own family, but it all goes into  a trust held in both of our names.  I am not at all worried about hitting anywhere close to my lifetime maximum.\n\nMy brothers are all a bit sensitive about the fact that my life is the only one that has been remotely \"on track\" and it would cause a lot more trouble for me as the executor and POA, if our mom outright gave me nothing.\n\nWe all love each other, deeply, and it would hurt them to know that Mom was the one who thought they were more \"needy\" than I, even if that is the case."]}
