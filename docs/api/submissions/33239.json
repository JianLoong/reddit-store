She was my wild child. Since she started walking she was climbing trees and terrorizing the wildlife. She would come in completely covered head to toe in dirt and debris every day. As a teenager she was rebellious. I was constantly worried I'd get a call that she was dead or in jail. She moved out when she was 18 and was determined to never need our help. \n\nAs an adult she is mature and responsible. She has a master's degree in business and is over a hospital and a couple of doctors offices. She met her husband (33) when she was 21 and those two were perfect for each other. They own a farm and have a set of triplets ( they had infertility problems). \n\nThey have never once asked for money or really needed any help from us at all. Maybe to baby sit every now and then but that's about it. Those two just have it all put together. \n\nMy youngest (27) lives in a camper trailer with her husband. They have 5 children and she is pregnant again. They also have several cats and dogs. Both work but both have low paying jobs. Both refuse to do more. I gave her just as much as her sister to go to college. She chose not to and spent it all. It seems like every week they need money for something. We pay most of their bills ( power, water, car insurance, phones, etc). I don't want my grandchildren living in the dark so I pay. \n\nRecently my husband and I did our will and named out eldest executor of estate. We both have some serious health problems so we figured it was time ( honestly we should have done it sooner but better late than never). Our eldest didn't say anything about the money and mostly just asked questions about what we want her to do, how we want funerals and if we wanted to be buried or cremated, what to do with the estate, etc. The normal end of life stuff. \n\nWe ( my husband and I) divided out inheritance and our eldest got most of it. My reasoning is our youngest has used all of her inheritance in the money we are constantly having to give her. I did divide out my jewelry equally and several other items for them and when we pass they are to sell our home and equally split it. \n\nWell this has caused a huge issue with my youngest who believes I am favoring her sister. I don't believe so. Her sister has simply not needed any of her inheritance and is the more responsible of my daughters. I know when the time comes she will know what to do and will do what is necessary for everything. \n\nMy youngest has decided to no longer speak to me so I am trying to figure out if I am being an Ahole.", "created_utc": 1702852229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kt5ay/aita_for_not_splitting_our_estate_equally_between/", "score": 264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are allowed to divide your estate as you see fit. It is not at all unusual for a person to divide their estate unequally, for many reasons. I guess the youngest figured the gravy train would keep coming; but you are spending her part of the estate now, as you explained. \n\nI would reconsider continuing to pay her now though; what if your deaths aren't imminent, as you think? Do you want her to drain your estate?\n\nYou are wise to let them know this in advance. Double check with a lawyer that the will can't be challenged.", "I\u2019ll bet she starts speaking to you as soon as the next bill she can\u2019t pay shows up. It\u2019s your choice to divide your estate as you choose. No one is owed anything and your younger daughter might just be a little too comfortable with getting her \u201cinheritance\u201d up front. She\u2019s chosen her life and it\u2019s not up to you to pay for her choices, now or in the future. If you\u2019re comfortable with your decision, that\u2019s all that matters. NTA.", "I was the youngest daughter.  I graduated from college and had a good job that I liked. Then married a guy that was NOT a knight in shining armor but a loser in tin foil.\n (Figured that out years later). We had 2 kids in 17 months. One was special needs. I worked 2 jobs. He couldn't or wouldn't keep a job to save his life. \n\nHe ran up huge credit card debts to the point we had to declare bankruptcy; he took our house payment $$ and gambled. We lost the house.\n\nYou get the picture. My parents bailed us out for the children's sake more than once. They have told me I already had my inherentance. And, TBH, I wasn't even mad about it because it's true.  \n\nWish I'd ditched the loser years earlier  but I truly loved him till it just wore me down; doing everything by myself.  \n\nMy point OP, is you are not TA. Your daughter is probably a mix of angry and embarrassed.  At least I was when I had to ask for help. \n\nIn speaking from experience, lay some boundaries and stick to it. Why WOULD they change if you bail them out over and over? I was horrified but my then husband had no shame. He'd rather ask my parents for money than work.", "NTA\n\nIf you're the one who's been paying your youngest daughter's bills all this time, then yes, that right there is her inheritance.\n\nIt's not like you're even giving your oldest daughter everything. They'll each get some keepsakes and half the proceeds from your house. Plus it sounds like your oldest is going to be dealing with the after-life things, so honestly to me it just seems fair.", "NTA. Maybe you could try and estimate all the money you\u2019ve spent on your younger daughter and itemise it in a way that demonstrates an equal split. Also make sure you do your will with a proper solicitor (and not a diy or internet will) as I think your daughter will try and fight your other sister in court for a larger payout", "NTA\n\nYou have provided help for your immature and irresponsible daughter for much of her adult life. You are 100% correct, she has already spent a vast majority of her inheritance by taking money from you as often and as much as she has. \n\nShe has a low paying job and refuses to change all while refusing to stop having kids.... Who does that?!?! Why in the hell would anyone want to live in a trailer with SIX kids and multiple animals?!?!\n\nA little advice.... Make sure your oldest daughter knows you want the house sold. I wouldn't be shocked if youngest tries to talk oldest into letting her have the house for her family when you're gone.", "NTA\n\nWhile sitting up our Living Trust for our children the question of one being a \"spendthrift\"  was a recurring topic.  It is a reality many families face.\n\nNot sure if y'all looked into a Living Trust but its an excellent way to protect your wishes and its when set up correctly, its very hard to contest in court.  Your \"spendthrift\"  sounds like someone who might contest the will.  It also takes a lot of pressure off your daughter.\n\nGood Luck, its not fun.  Been there done that.", "INFO: Did you show them both an accounting of how much the younger sister has already received so that she can see herself whether your division of the estate is fair?", "It may not make a difference, but you could put together a document of all the money you've given your younger daughter, compared to what the eldest will possibly  inherit.\n\nThere's no guarantee she'll inherit a lot anyway. Assuming you're in the US, one severe or prolonged illness could wipe out both their inheritences.", "NTA \n\nShe received her inheritance while you are living. While I don't believe its necessary to go to college to make good money, it does require a work ethic  and some level of ambition.", "In general, you should treat your children equally.\n\nIn this case you are.  Your youngest child is constantly asking you for money and is dependent on you to pay many of their bills.\n\nInheritances should not be expected.  You and your spouse could spend it all down.  Health care in the US can be very expensive.\n\nIf youngest daughter wants to cut you off, let her.  Stop paying her bills.\n\nNTA", "NTA -- but I would give a list to the younger DD as to what you have spent on her.", "NTA. You can ask her if she wants you to continue helping her or save her inheritance for later. She can't have it both ways.\n\nPersonally, I think you are doing her no favors by supporting her the way you do. It gives her no incentive to stand on her own two feet. Our job as parents is to make sure they can survive without us. What is she going to do when you are gone?\n\nIt's hard when kids are in the mix, but maybe she'd rise up if she knew you weren't going to be there. Go ahead and support her for things that will get her ahead, like her education (maybe trade school?) or childcare so she can get a job.\n\nAnother thing you might consider is giving the share that would have gone to her to her children's college fund, because she sure as heck hasn't set one up for them.", "NTA.  Your reasons for splitting the estate the way you are strike me as sound, and you are not attempting to manipulate your children from beyond the grave.  \n\nThat said, I have an alternate suggestion.  Given your younger daughter's circumstances, her children are going to have a tough time getting started in life.  You may wish to place your estate (or a portion thereof) into a trust or trusts that will pay for  your grandchildren to go to college.  I suggest discussing this with your older daughter (not your younger) to see if she is comfortable administering such a trust, and if she is not, then designate someone trustworthy to administer the trust.", "I hope your you used a lawyer for the wills and I also hope your wills contain language that explains your reasoning for the unequal distribution of the estate.  That is helpful (in this jurisdiction, anyway) in the event one sibling seeks to vary the will after you and your spouse are worm food.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money to do with as you wish.\n\nAs others have suggested, maybe itemise what's been spent so the younger daughter knows. I think the amount could come as a big shock.\n\nGet a lawyer if you haven't already to ensure she can't challenge the will via alleging undue influence etc from your older daughter.", "Put everything in writing. If you want the property sold put in writing. If there are family heirlooms to be given put it in writing. What to do with any vehicles put it writing. If it is writing there is no doubt what you want done and the executor will have a firm path of disposal. Leave no room for doubt", "NTA. Your money, your choice, as someone said.  You don't get to be upset that her choice is to have nothing to do with you. You also need to ensure that your oldest is okay taking care of your husband and you in your last moments.", "This is the way my family has always done it. I\u2019ve gotten my share when some of my family were alive and after the rest of them pass, I don\u2019t expect the remainder to be split between my brother and I, I expect him to get all of it.", "I was so scared you were going to say you were giving it to your youngest because she \u201cneeds\u201d it more", "NTA - Your money your choice", "Ur not the ass. Ur youngest is taking it personally but u explained ur reasoning and the money has already been spent on her. U can't control that. Plus, if ur eldest hasn't needed any help, then y should she get equal inheritance? Keep doing what u think is best for ur family and don't let one daughter's hurt feelings dictate everything.", "NTA. You can divide your estate however you want.  Put pencil to paper for the younger daughter and put that accounting in with your will.  It just might turn out the more stable daughter is actually getting less in the long run.  Your younger daughter chose her life and you have been generous so far.  Apparently she feels a bit entitled.", "NTA. The youngest has used you as an atm and will produce more kids she can\u2019t afford as long as the money is flowing from you. She needs to know that this is her inheritance and it is a finite amount. What is she going to do - if she doesn\u2019t talk to you , how will she pay her next bill ? It is great that you are being fair with the children. Usually the lazy good for nothing kid is favored and the responsible kid is punished for being too successful by cutting off their inheritance.", "As I was reading, I thought to myself that you should be keeping track of how much you spend on your younger daughter, so that you could give your older daughter that amount on top of the inheritance split.\n\nAnd it sounds like that's what you did. Kudos for being a fair parent, and for not showing any favoritism.\n\nIt's sad that your daughter is too entitled to recognize that fairness, but ultimately that's her problem, not yours. \n\nI don't know how much rational thought you can expect from someone living in a trailer and working on their sixth kid they can't afford, though. If she wants to cut you out of her life after all the help you've given her, then maybe you're better off.\n\nNTA.", "Nta for doing with your money what you want but why are you at all surprised that your daughter is angry?\nWhy did this even need to be announced except to somehow punish your daughter?\nWhy did this pot need stirring?", "Was the youngest not a college type kid? Like college wasn't the right setting for her. Or is she flat out refusing to try anything to better herself? Not looking for better pay or anything?", "NTA", "NTA.  It's your estate so it's your decision.  This way of splitting it is actually equitable.  Your younger daughter has \"pre-spent\" a lot of her portion of an equal split.  Her poor decisions (including having kids she can't support) should not mean that she's entitled to more money than her sister.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a tough position to be in, but your reasoning is sound. You know the one daughter that didn\u2019t expect this will use the money wisely to make her family\u2019s future more secure - perhaps a college fund for her kids or something practical and longer term.\n\nThe other will likely use it to continue to get by and stay her current state of poverty - regardless if you give her $25k or $100k. I know this because she sounds much like my own sister in many ways.\n\nAnyway - your money, your kids, your decision.\n\nOne potential thing to consider is if you have a larger place, perhaps give that to your youngest so she can have space for her kids and then give the rest to your oldest. (Probably doesn\u2019t really work out, but just a thought).", "You are definitely NTA.  Your youngest had the same opportunities to get a good education and better herself.  She chose not to and has leeched off you for years.  She has burned through her share of any inheritance so only has herself to blame.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure you will be hearing from your daughter a lot sooner than you think, she is going to need you to keep the electricity on for all of her kids.", "NTA. You had to decide which daughter you were more willing to offend. You could have been \"fair\" by giving equal shares to each even though you've given far more help to your younger daughter already.\n\nOr you could set it up so that some portion (maybe even a majority) of your estate goes into a trust that benefits your grandchildren in equal shares and skips your daughters.", "I have found that whatever their goals or circumstances, being fair (which sometimes means giving each what they need not necessarily the same thing) avoids the feelings of favoritism.  I feel like this whether one has a much higher paying job, etc. because I feel like giving one a lot more \u201cbecause they need it\u201d still feels unfair like they are being punished for doing well or the other rewarded for coasting a bit as well as that i have  made clear that I got them through college with no debt and they shouldnt \u201ccount on\u201d an inheritance (as that expectation seems to lead to resentment if things dont turn out as they wished or imagined) .  That being said, when they have needed large assistance (down payment on a house for example), if I wasnt gifting the other an equivalent amount then I was clear that it was \u201cpart of their inheritance\u201d and that the other would receive the equivalent later or when allocating whatever I have left.  \n\nSo, I do think it is better to be upfront with that so expectations dont lead to disappointment/resentment, so perhaps instead laying out what has been already spent on the one receiving less and explaining that it would be unfair not to provide the same support for her sister would help; presenting it as this IS equity (and perhaps even considering everything she may even be ahead).   NTA.", "Due to your reasons I believe you did the correct thing. No matter how much help you give the youngest she keeps making bad choices.", "Your younger daughter will always think you're the asshole.  How else is she supposed to feel.  I get your reasoning and you're not unjustified.... But the feelings are going to be hurt no matter which way you slice it.  Do what you're heart says.", "Why tell them what you\u2019re going to do? What possible benefit does it achieve by telling them what you intend to do? You leave instructions for the executor and a will. All you have achieved is to make one daughter very unhappy. So YTA.", "NTA\u2026 how about setting up a trust for your youngest daughter\u2019s children, only for college at age 18, or they can get the whole thing at 22 or another age?", "YTA\n\nYou should divide it equally. Her annoyance is understandable. It's not that hard to get it.", "YTA not only are you creating animosity between your youngest and yourselves but also between them which will last long after you\u2019re gone", "Yta. But not for disinheriting your daughter.\n\nCan u not set up a college trust where half of your assets are held for your grandchildren which has your good daughter as an executor. \n\nTherefore bad daughter can\u2019t get the funds but you are not punishing the children and at least giving them a shot.", "YTA. I understand that your daughter makes bad decisions but you should still try your best to help her. Her children especially don't deserve to suffer because of her bad decisions. You should split your estate equally and put her half in a trust that pays out monthly. That way she can't blow it but she'll get help paying her bills", "YTA.

Had to be specific things like medical, food, various actual necessities.", "NTA. If your youngest now wants to stop speaking to you rather than understanding how much you have already given her and being grateful let her. See how long it takes before she needs more money and decides it\u2019s time to talk. Your reasoning seems fair, continue to split it or just cut your youngest out completely (put her half in a trust for the grandkids when they are of age).", "NTA unless Christian. If Christian then review prodigal son parable. Perhaps troubled daughter needs a spendthrift trust? If troubled child had a physical as opposed to the obvious mental / emotional disability would you have this concept?", "NTA. Your youngest has already received so much help from you, and this is your way of making it more fair to your oldest. I get the feeling that your youngest stopped speaking to you to try and manipulate you into giving her more, not because she is hurt and needs time to heal.", "NTA and perhaps you giving them money and paying their bills is enabling their lack of motivation and drive to improve their own lives.\n\nThis is actually the proper way to handle this, if you want to go based of equal inheritance: younger one burned through hers and the oldest didn't, she'll get hers after you two pass. This is normal. Although, if it were me, I wouldn't leave anything to the younger one, no items worth much such as fine jewelery because she'll just burn through that as well. Anything you want passed down as an heirloom I wouldn't give to her.\n\nEnd if the day, it's your money that you earned and you get to decide what to do with it and if she doesn't like it and is ignoring you then perhaps it's time for you to cut the purse strings.", "NTA  Your money, your choice.\n\nI would consider bypassing your youngest and setting up trusts for her kids.  Sounds like they're gonna be sol for any financial backing from mom & dad.", "NTA. This is refreshing, most of these posts have the parents giving to the one who is impulsive and irresponsible (\u2018they need it more!\u2019). Your decision is fair. Any other way and your eldest would be paying the price for your youngest\u2019s mistake. At the end of the day it sounds like they both get the same amount so it is split equally, just one daughter has started using hers already.", "NtA.

You folks rock.", "NTA.  Your youngest isn't responsible enough to be an executor, so your eldest is definitely the better choice.   Also, as you age and illness becomes more of a problem, you may need someone responsible and dependable to make decisions on your behalf if you are mentally incapable.

The money was supposed to be a loan, but my parents refused to accept my paying them back, so I asked my dad to make sure to compensate my brother for the cost of my house in their will. We may fuss & fight as siblings often do, but one thing we\u2019ve never allowed to come between us is money. \n\nNTA, OP, your younger daughter is spoiled & entitled.

As several people said you need to establish more firm boundaries with her and stick to them.", "NTA in the least. As others have said, your estate is yours to do as you see fit. In my family, I'm the responsible one and my brother is more like your younger daughter. My mom has bailed him out numerous times and her will leaves him completely out. I'm sure my brother will bitch and moan about that, but he was happy to accept $80-90k while he kept drinking until she finally just cut him off. You've worked hard for what you have and it would be a pity to see it wasted.", "Your a little bit ta. I know legally you can do what you want, but I would generally think my parents did not love me as much.  It dosnt  matter how you rationalise it that\u2019s what it would come down to.

IMO yta sorry !", "NTA. \n\nI completely agree with the reason why you did what you did, except for one thing, not that my agreement matters at all.\n\nPlease hire a an executor instead of making your eldest your executor. If there was any way, in the future, that your children are going to have a relationship with each other, you need your eldest not to be in a seemingly power position over your youngest. \n\nYour children are probably going to be emotionally charged after your passing and having your eldest in charge of dividing your estate isn\u2019t going to make them get along any better.", "NTA, and don't worry, she will start talking to you again when she needs a bill paid.", "NTA. The problem is when you and hubby depart this earth, the sisters might be forever divided by money. Death can bring loved ones closer or tear them apart. I have a feeling you know what\u2019s going to happen. Can you think about leaving the grandkids something in a trust. At least younger daughter will not be surprised.", "NTA.  You have the right to do whatever you want with YOUR money.  Maybe sit down with a document detailing the funds already given to the younger daughter so she understands your rationale.

A few years after my grandmother passed, my grandfather remarried. Shortly before he passed, his wife convinced him to alter his will. Originally, the money that he took into the marriage and had saved was supposed to be split 3 ways among his sons (my dad being the oldest and executor of the will). It was to be given in installments. Part immediately and part a year after his passing. The wife got the fully paid off house and car and whatever money she brought into the marriage and the life insurance. They never combined finances. The adjustment said that the wife got the interest from the inheritance money until she dies...which means the inheritance is tied up for as long as she lives. My dad's youngest brother has never been good with money and often relied upon my grandparents/grandfather as his safety net. The last 3 years have been a struggle, and he's even approached my dad about getting some of the inheritance early, but legally, my dad can't do that.", "I wholeheartedly agree", "Why won\u2019t they use birth control?

I'm really glad the daughter who gave it her all isn't being punished for the others' poor decisions.", "OP, NTA, but did you look into some kind of trust (manage by your elder daughter for your grand children), instead of an inheritance (or in addition). You could probably set up something to make  sure than your grand-children have what they need to get out of this situation.
