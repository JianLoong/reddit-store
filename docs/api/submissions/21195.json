I make dinner during the week and he makes dinner on weekends.\n\n\nI got home 5:10 and he wasn't home. Baby had been screaming for the last 30 mins of the drive, I was tired and pretty high strung. When I called my husband I had to scream \"where are you?\" to be heard over the screaming baby. It would have come across as aggressive, but I wasn't mad at this point.\n\n\nHusband said he was out drinking with a friend, I asked him why he was at a bar on a Sunday evening. He said he thought I wouldn't be home until after dinner. He'd apparently misheard me. This is when I got mad. I snapped at him, asking why he'd think id keep the baby out until after dinner on a Sunday. I told him to come home asap. He said he wasn't intending to come home for another 2 hours and that I should have messaged when I was leaving the event. I said I didn't message because I had my hands full and I expected him to get the first bus home. He eventually agreed to be home by 6:30.\n\n\n6:30 passes and he's not home. I call again and he says he's still at the bar. I lost my absolute shit saying that I was waiting for him to come home to help fix the baby somethingto eat, but now the baby will have to go to bed without a proper meal or bath. He said I was acting psychotic, to give the baby pouch food, and that the baby didn't need a bath. He said he didn't want to come home because I was acting hostile and he didn't want to be around me. I told him to forget about me and that he needs to come home because he has an obligation to help take care of his son. \n\n\nHusband comes home at 8pm after baby is asleep.\n\n\nI ask him this morning why he thought it was cool to refuse to come home and leave me to tend to the baby alone after being with the baby alone all day. He said he didn't know we'd be home that early. I said sorry for not messaging that we were leaving event and asked why he didnt come home once he found out he'd misunderstood. He said me being rude on the phone made him not want to come home. \n\n\nI think I'm an AH for being stressed out but I think he's an AH for using that as an excuse to not fulfil his parental duties.\n\n\n So am I an AH for getting mad?\n\nEDIT: I FED THE BABY !!!!!!\nThe baby usually eats what we eat. We use pouched food for flavour/padding. It's an agreement between us that he makes dinner on the weekends. He didn't make dinner or arrange with me in advance to make dinner, so the baby only had the pouched food and breastmilk. When I say the baby didn't have a \"proper dinner\" I mean a home cooked one. The baby definitely still had plenty to eat, just not the kind of meal we would usually give him.\n\nEDIT 2: him not being home when he says he will and generally not fulfilling commitments is a pattern of behaviour for him. This is the most recent occurrence of many.\n\n\nUPDATE: when my husband got home today i told him I did  lot of crying over last night's situation and said I was sorry for blowing up at him, and that I was tired and stressed and was expecting him to be home to help/make dinner as per our arrangement. I told him that I'm happy for him to go out at night every now and then but he needs to *tell me in advance* and be accountable for his responsibilities. I said I would try and not react to these situations so strongly, but also that I'd prefer they not occur at all - that he should put his prior commitments to his family first. He agreed that once he realised he misunderstood me he should have come home and that it was childish for him to stay out and leave me alone with the baby out of spite.", "created_utc": 1688351462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14p6hhx/aita_for_getting_mad_and_demanding_my_husband/", "score": 2197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn\u2019t mishear you about when you\u2019d be home, he chose to not keep his responsibilities to his family so he could stay out drinking. If he had just misunderstood, you wouldn\u2019t have had to convince him to be on the first bus home, he would have been walking towards the door before you even got off the phone. \nAlso, I don\u2019t understand why people are making a big deal about you having to yell over the baby. Most people drive using CarPlay or\nBluetooth, so the receiver is not right up to their mouth. The baby would have been just as loud as if not louder than you, while you were driving, so, of course, you had to raise your voice to be heard. Also after having to drive home with a screaming baby, I can totally understand why you\u2019d be frustrated with a husband who just decides to leave you to deal with the fallout of his unmet responsibilities.", "These comments are not at all what I was expecting. I get OP shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but to victimize the husband entirely is just ignoring so much of his negligent behavior. OP, I would chalk this up to the Reddit hive mind at work. The people responding ESH are probably considering both sides, but the commenters responding YTA should just be ignored.", "NTA. I might get downvoted but the YTA comments are unhinged. \n\n\nHe was home alone all day and didn\u2019t even prep dinner or get things ready for you? You had the baby solo and he decided to go out and not tell you. I might be harsh but when he found out you were home early and you were stress he should have IMMEDIATELY come home and help. You haven\u2019t had a break yet. Solo parenting is exhausting (I\u2019m a solo mum). I am frankly disgusted at his audacity to stay out until 8pm. So that\u2019s over 3hours since you were home that he ignored you. You mentioned that this discussion on communicating happens often and he gets time with his friends often and you also do the majority of the baby care. Does he give you a break? Yeha you shouldn\u2019t have yelled but it sounds like it\u2019s been bubbling for a while. He needs a reality check.", "I'm genuinely shocked at these comments. \n\nNTA\n\n I'm guessing most of you don't have children or don't remember what it's like to be breastfeeding, how exhausting it is to breastfeed, to be out all day with an 8-month-old, come home and the person whose responsibility it is to help you has dipped out and then refuses to come home to fulfill his obligations. I sympathize with you, OP. I hope you can get a nap in today or a little alone time in the evening.", "NTA - I\u2019ve seen enough of my friends go thru this with their own husbands, tho I think communication could be better, you\u2019re probably exhausted and just hoped he would be home to take the baby hand off, just communicate better next time.", "NTA except for the screaming part.\n\nHe should have stepped up and he let you down and the baby is only 8 months old? He cooks only once a week and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do it on his day?

It would have come across as aggressive, but I wasn't mad at this point.\n\nYou didn't have to scream. If the baby was screaming in the background but you were speaking directly into the receiver then it wouldn't be so hard for him to hear you.\n\n> I lost my absolute shit saying that I was waiting for him to come home to help fix the baby something to eat, but now the baby will have to go to bed without a proper meal or bath.\n\nIf you were to put the baby to bed without a meal or a bath then that's your choice...just like it was your choice to be so abusive to your husband. I get that you would've appreciated some help, but you could've communicated that in a healthy manner.", "ESH. You bit his head off when you called him and it's no wonder he got his back up and didn't want to come home to deal with you. All the same, he should have come to take care of the baby. Not sure why you took the baby with you anyway, instead of just leaving him at home. Seems like it would have been easier for everyone.", "If I had been around my baby all day and came home to no husband (contrary to what his plans were) I would be pissed. Just reading her post gives me anxiety.\n\nI would be yelling too and the fact he wouldn't come home would make me madder. When is drinking at a bar more important than helping with your child. I don't care how she talked to him....respect works both ways.", "NTA, once he knew you were distressed at home and needed his help ,he should have come to help and then addressed your attitude, not avoid you and baby and stay out longer ,like how was that gonna help the situation", "NTA. He had a simple job. To make dinner on the weekends. You already do so much. Honestly you deserve a holiday. You let him know about his plans and he didn\u2019t listen nor did he inform you about your plans. Sounds like you do the lions share of the child rearing and home tasks. You spent ALL day with the baby. What the hell was he doing? You sound burned out and tired. \n\nI don\u2019t care about being downvoted. Your husband needs to help out more. \n\nTry going out at night and not coming home until late, he can do dinner, bath and bedtime. See how he likes it.", "NTA - if you have a baby, you know what it\u2019s like.", "NTA. This is why I don\u2019t want children. Fathers can go out whenever they want and do whatever they want but as soon as the mother asks for some help everyone jumps down her throat about it. \n\nI don\u2019t care about your downvotes I can about mothers needing a break! Mothers are judged more harshly than fathers and it\u2019s not fair. For this reason I\u2019ll never have kids.", "I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have the day you had, but I can relate to being exhausted and expecting that XYZ is going to happen in a certain way. I have freaked out like this and it ended much the same way as your day did. No matter what, people don\u2019t like to be talked to that way, and further more, despite being exhausted we still need to be flexible when the unexpected happens\u2026esp for our spouse who has plans with friends. It makes no sense to call you an AH, but I highly recommend making some adjustments to assure you\u2019re not pushed this far frequently. I.e. some premade homemade frozen meals. To give everyone the best shot at success.", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed too. Sure you didn\u2019t handle it well but you acknowledged that.", "Strong YTA\n\nWe don't shout at our partners.

You are entitled to be angry.\n\nSaying he didn't want to come home because of the way you are speaking to him is a pathetic excuse.\n\nIf it was me he would be doing bedtime routine for a week after treating you this shabbily.

Communication is key!", "YTA, it sounds like you came home earlier than expected. You got mad he wasn't there and then ordered him like he was your child to come home. Then, instead of just feeding the baby and getting the baby settled, you threw a tantrum and neglected the baby because it was his turn?\n\nI get being frustrated from a long day. I get being frustrated from the baby crying for the last leg of the trip. \n\nWhat I don't get is why you didn't pull over to calm the baby down. Why you got mad that your husband had gone out with a friend when you weren't expected home yet. Why you waited to feed your baby until your husband came home to do it. And why you think you can order your partner to come home like a wayward teen.\n\nWhen you did call, you could have explained that the baby was being fussy and you would appreciate it if he would come home and help you tend to the baby because you are feeling frustrated and would like to lie down before getting dinner started. Or maybe he could pick something up on his way. home. \n\nYou are in a marriage, one hopefully built on love, act like it.", "YTA for refusing to feed your baby properly just because your husband wasn\u2019t home.  I get you were exhausted and frustrated, but taking it out on your child like that was inexcusable.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think he misheard you. It\u2019s stressful to feed a baby when you\u2019re tired, hungry, and had a busy day. I was hungrier breastfeeding than when I was pregnant, so it\u2019s not out of pocket for you to get hangry when your husband flaked on his dinner duties.", "NTA. READ THE EDIT! OP FED HER BABY!!!", "ESH\n\nAs others have said, you don't scream at your partner. 100% unhealthy, especially for something that sounds like a misunderstanding. It's understandable to be frustrated he misheard what you said but freaking out on him isn't right either. I will say that once it was clear you were home and wanted help with the baby, then he should've come home ASAP rather than staying out. That's what makes him TA, though I can't blame him for not wanting to come home to a screaming spouse.\n\nYou also need to be more flexible. So there's not a home cooked meal that night. So what?? Do something quick. Feed your kid the pouch food and breastmilk you said you did. They're not going to care so long as they're fed. Life doesn't go as planned. He's not home when you want him to be? Feed the kid, bathe them, put them to bed if it's bedtime. If your partner gets home in time to help with any of that, great. If they're not, grumble about it and do it anyway. Then have a \\*discussion\\* with your partner about the miscommunication, why you're so upset, and ways communication can be improved.", "ESH. But your husband much more than you because he's bailing on his responsibilities and making everything about him being scared of you. He was scared of what? You questioning him? You asking him why he didn't come home on time?\nEven if he went out, you have an agreement about cooking and managing the house. What kind of a partner is he who feels that it is okay for you to handle baby, cooking, and house after coming back from a whole day with the baby, driving, and socialising?\nFrom your comments, it is clear that you are the primary child care provider and he gets to maintain a full functional social life with dinner and drinks every weekend.\nThe only reason I'm calling you an AH is because you screamed and worsened the situation. It is not the right way to deal with such situations. I get your frustrations and understand why you did it, but it is still not an excuse. \nWork better on communication.", "It sounds like you might need some help managing your anxiety. You definitely overreacted in this situation. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, just overstimulated and overwhelmed.", "NAH\n\nBut I do get the impression that you don\u2019t know how good you\u2019ve got it with this man.", "ESH/NTA.\n\nWhile I started to read I was wondering why you didn't leave an 8 month old baby home, but instead took it out of town, when it would have been easier to keep your husband occupied with the baby.\n\nNow back to the way you acted on the phone. It's understandable to be mad at this point, but you could have fed it some baby food. As I understood your husband cooks dinner every weekend so the baby would have been fine with some gruel or whatever types of baby food you had available. I would have also been mad but he acknowledged his mistake, and so did you, but YTA for guilt triping him using your baby. However your husband shouldn't have neglected taking care of your baby because \"you were acting vile\". A woman's behavior shouldn't stop you from bathing your child. Just because he didn't want to deal with you, shouldn't mean that he should leave the baby all to you after you've been entertaining him all day long. So for that, your husband is TA. Dealing with such a young child isn't a job for one (I assume this is your first child and you both are quite young) so he shouldn't have ignored you and your kid because you were angry at him", "ESH- you have terrible communication as a couple. It takes 30 seconds to text and say, \u201cwe are on our way home, make sure you have food ready for X!\u201d  On the same account, he should have prepared food and texted you to check in on timing. This is what partners do- they communicate.", "ESH. You suck for yelling at your husband. This sounds like legit screaming not just raising your voice which is completely unacceptable. He sucks for reneging on commitments he made and then lying about coming home at 6:30. Honestly this relationship sounds like it's headed downhill, but that isn't an excuse to treat each other without respect like this. Regardless of what he did wrong, you owe him an apology for how you responded and he owes you an apology for the pattern of unreliability you described. You should apologize first even if you are upset about his actions", "NAH - Dealing with a screaming baby is stressful. So I do feel like a lot of the anger/stresswas projected at your partner. Which is something that needs working on but many parents, myself included have been guilty of.\n\nHe had all day to go out with this friend and picked the one time where he should have been helping with the baby. He also did not communicate this to you but was hypocritical in blaming you for not messaging you are on the way back.\n\nHowever I feel his response is fair. Had he had a more calm discussion with you about coming home and helping, he might have been more inclined to return. The route of the issue could have been tabled as feedback later. As all this seems like a communication issue.\n\nI do find it funny all the people saying \"why would you take the baby with you?\" Don't these people know that parents like spending time with their kids and that some mothers breastfeed?", "ESH.\n\nI get why you lost it at him. He\u2019s also TA because he stayed away out of SPITE after you were burned out and refused to help you.  That\u2019s more messed up than what you did.", "Sorry, you didn\u2019t feed your baby just to punish your husband for staying out a couple hours due to a schedule misunderstanding? Yes, he should have come home, but YTA.", "YTA - my mom managed to fed and take care of 4 children (newborn to 10 years old) when my dad was deployed for a year. I wonder how she did it when it takes two people to fed just one baby. \n\nYour husband is a person, too. Maybe he wanted a couple of hours out. You really made yourself look real good in front of his friend (and himelook emasculated). They probably wondered why he didn't want to run right home to your loving arms (I'm being sarcastic).\n\nThere's going to be times when you, too, want an evening with your girlfriend(s) - guess you won't be able to go since it will take two of you to feed the baby and put it  to bed.", "You took the baby for both kindly and practical reasons.  You hoped to return and pass the baby baton after a long day. I get that. .... But you miscommunicated and then blamed him for it.. that wasnt fair (but considering you were tired) it is excusable. No assholes.... but unwisely  unleashed fury will never help, only alienate", "ESH. You shouldn't be upset he misheard you. That could have been a genuine mistake. He fucks up when he refuses to leave the bar and says he's staying another two hours. He should have come home instantly. \n\nOnce he said he wasn't coming home you should have gotten that baby food instead of being petty. You let that baby be hungry. I don't understand how messaging you after the event would make a difference if calling didn't.", "Husband is definitely the AH for drinking while his family was at home waiting for him and shirking his responsibility.

Nevertheless, he said he'd be home at time certain, and - as you point out - his responsibility to his child is outside of and exceeds his desire to not be around you (as understandable as that was in the moment).

How do you expect how going out of town with a child that isn't a newborn anymore but still doesn't know how to communicate alone usually goes? Mommy has time to chat and the baby sits in their stroller, sometimes she has to change nappies and that's it? Do you understand  how stressful it is to be on an event with a small kid alone? Our son is 2yo, so him being a teething baby is still fresh in my mind. Going to events like this alone (you can't even drink or eat alone. Depending on the event, it is almost impossible to use the bathroom because you can't take the stroller with you) was a nightmare for me.

I am heading home now but we should talk about screaming after the baby is in bed\", not negotiating about more time at the bar.

Just means you made a poor choice in \u201cpartner\u201d for parenting. He\u2019s the AH.

Add in PPD and its debilitating.\n\nAnd you pull the car over and you just start ugly crying too.  You are desperate and need someone to let you tap out so you can reset and recover.\n\nYeah, yelling isn't the best form of communication.

If he wanted to he would have come home. If he wanted to go out drinking, he could have easily arrange to swap a weekday that OP makes dinner on with a weekend day so that he's free to go out but know baby is taken care of. He didn't care. He let OP make dinner all week, kept secret he was going out with a friend on one of the only nights he's responsible for dinner (how come he says OP should have called when the event ended but *he* couldn't shoot her a text to let her know his plans have changed in case she comes home early?) so that op wouldn't be able to call him on it till it's too late to do anything about it, Then dropped that day on her because he \"intended to keep drinking another two hours\" basically meaning OP took care of baby the whole week by herself.\n\nI'm actually super sensitive to being yelled at due to abuse trauma but guess what? People get upset and yell sometimes or for reasons I don't understand. You know how I learnt to handle it? Ask them why they are yelling. Ask them to lower their voice so we can discuss things maturely. Put my foot down that I will not engage in a shouting match if I need to etc. You know what I don't do? Revenge drink and refuse to take care of my baby because I'm mad someone yelled at me.\n\nOP's husband could have avoided this by asking op to lower her voice or ask why she was yelling them op could have easily explained she was trying to be heard over the baby in the background or that it wasn't malicious. He also could have come home, taken care of baby and then had a convo after with op explaining that he doesn't want to be spoken to like that and how he/they will handle it next time. \n\nMoreover it's a pattern of behavior on the husband's side.\n\nNTA OP. I see why a lot of women say it turned out being less work being a single mom than being a married parent.", "And notified her before she got home that he was going out... basic communication stuff.", "but babies generally need to be fed on a schedule or they won't eat their dinner properly, so when he first wasn't there with dinner ready/nearly ready, then said he'd do it at 630, and never turned up, he was making her job 1000% more stressful.\n\nI went through this sort of stuff with my ex except no mobile phones.", "*And* after she's spent the **entire week** feeding all of them.

I feel like those previous comments would be true if there was no baby. Being angry they werent home or demanding they came home if youre childless? Crazy and controlling.

Will having parents split up maybe fuck a kid up?  Also yes. \n\nY\u2019all need to chill with the jumping to divorce thing. Don\u2019t get married if you\u2019re so willing to divorce someone.

I'm going to have to start dinner myself\").", "I mean, I get this argument. But I\u2019m confused - is a person doing most of the legwork NOT supposed to get angry when it appears a partner is being negligent? Was she supposed to just ignore what clearly appears to be a track record of this behavior? Just call with a laugh and a smile? Who the hell wouldn\u2019t have snapped, and does that justify him further neglecting his wife AND child?
