Your husband was absolutely in the wrong to allow the kids to get into the dolls and mess with them. \n\nYou\u2019ve reminded me that I have a whole bunch of monster high dolls from justice and later Target and Walmart when they first came out in 2010 and 2011 and 2012. My child loved monster high and wanted all of them for a few years. They are just hanging around now in storage. I should get them out. I miss them.", "NTA-a collection doesn't have to have a high monetary value to be respected.  These are not just dolls. They are YOUR dolls.  You made it clear that they are off limits to your children.  Being a mom doesn't automatically mean that your kids have unlimited access to your personal possessions. \n\nYour kids most likely want to play with them in part because they know that they are special to you.  As I think another commenter suggested, you probably ought to consider getting them each a similar doll that they can play with.  It would be a wonderful thing to bond with them over.", "NTA at all. There's a difference between play time dolls and collectibles.  It's not a hard concept for GROWN MEN like your husband.", "NTA. Given how long you've been collecting them and how expensive they are, your husband can't pretend he is unaware of their meaning to you. It is reasonable to keep some things for yourself and not share with your children when they have their own things to play with. He was disrespecting you. \n\nI suspect this isn't the first time he's \"broken\" your rules (about dolls or anything else), though. He doesn't seem to think your feelings/opinions matter all that much.", "NTA - they are your collectables!! What if your husband had a hockey card collection and you let the kids go through them with their sticky fingers? Not okay. What if your husband had a vinyl collection and you let your kids go through them and scratch them all up? Not okay.", "Also, aside from him not thinking it was a big deal, it doesn\u2019t seem logical that your husband would - after 9 years - just \u2018let\u2019 your kids take whatever they wanted. More like they got in to them & he responded after the fact.", "You initially say he\u2019s been supportive of your collection, but what becomes clear here is he doesn\u2019t actually understand your relationship to your collection.\n\nNTA. Maybe get hubby on the right page so there isn\u2019t a next time.", "My mom had barbies that were off limits. I didn\u2019t understand WHY they were special, and i really wanted to play with them, but I still understood that they WERE special and I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch them.", "NTA  \nI have an extensive collection of reborn dolls which many consider a creepy and weird hobby. Needless to say they're not cheap and I've invested a substantial amount of money into my collection over the years but it's not just about the price, it's that they are pieces of art and not play toys. If someone wants to hold one I will hand one over in a muslin wrap with instructions not to touch their paintwork or hair but overall I prefer they look but don't touch. I have little ones in the house and they know not to touch them but even so I don't keep them where they can get to them because it would be my own fault if they did and they got damaged.  \nYour husband is in the wrong letting the kids into your room and specifically letting them play with your dolls because he knows they are your collectibles and not play dolls regardless of price or availability. Still, it might be better you store them up high if he's going to disrespect you like this. My husband absolutely despises my reborns but he'd still never touch one or let anyone else pick one up.\n\n It doesn't matter what people collect or the expense of the items, it's about others having respect for the person and respect for their belongings. Your husband isn't showing you any.", "NTA. I was going to say you should have put them somewhere the kids can't access them, because just because they hear \"don't touch\" and know that they are not theirs, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will *always* be able to restrain their desire to play with the dolls, especially which society tends to say dolls/toys are just for kids. Also, little kids lean more into thinking everything that is their parents is theirs, too. Kinda. Young developing brains and all. (I, a generally Very Well Behaved child, remember getting into my mom's makeup with one of my friends when we were quite young, I think friend broke an eyeshadow palette? Or got it all over the bedspread?)\n\nBut yeah, your husband should have not let them get into the dolls no matter how much they wanted to play with them, because they weren't not theirs. He shouldn't have let them in the room at all, but since he did and they got to the dolls, he should have taken them away the moment he noticed and reiterated that they were not theirs to play with. It's really shitty of him to have called them \"just dolls\" when they are clearly more to you. I doubt he'd like it if the kids played and messed up his collectibles, cherished objects, whatever they are.", "YTA-ish. \n\nIf you\u2019re reacting this strongly, don\u2019t you think perhaps your toys would be best kept in a secured/locked display case rather than just in your room? You have kids. If you don\u2019t want them to find & okay with things, you need to take better steps to prevent it. It sounds like they may have gone in while your husband was busy with something else. At 7 & 9, it\u2019s understandable he wouldn\u2019t be watching them closely.\n\nYou\u2019re not TA for not letting them play with them. Kids don\u2019t need to play with everything & they need to have boundaries. My only real issue is that simply telling them they can\u2019t & not having them in a (genuinely) secure place makes something like this commonplace.", "Yta\n\nAnd i think someday down the line you will regret it.   I get it that you love and enjoy  your dolls.  But can't you understand your kids want to love and enjoy your dolls too?  It's like having a display of candy and gifts under glass and telling them not to touch or want it.  \n\nIf you expect them to have such discipline, why don't you put your dolls away for a few years and bring them out once they are past the age to enjoy them?  If you want to be treated with respect you should learn to respect their feelings too.   ThEY are just children.", "Not the asshole but some people may find your behavior strange", "Info: are you asking if you're an AH for keeping he dolls off limits from your kids or for yelling at your husband?", "Of course NTA. Look, I understand the value of sentimental items and from what I read on what the kids did, that right there made me shudder. OP, you may have to place your Monster High collection somewhere away from kids. Most likely lock them up in a special room since there is no doubt this will happen again.

I understand some of those dolls are very expensive including accessories, on top of that the Monster High dolls strike me as easily breakable.  People don\u2019t realize how expensive some dolls or collectible toys can be. I have a pony I was blessed to find at a yard sale that sells for over $300-$400 years ago and others I admit I\u2019ve paid a considerable amount for. my mother was always trying to give them away ( unfortunately she once succeeded giving away about half of the original collection about 20 years ago while I was away).  If I had kids and they messed with my collection I would be furious. That was total disregard for your collection and your property, which you have probably spent quite a bit of money on .  Invest in a locked display case asap and hide the key.  Maybe you can buy them some relatively cheap monster high dolls of their own off of ebay so they can play with those and stay out of your collection", "NTA in the slightest.

Your husband knows these dolls are special (but perhaps not just HOW special) they are to you. But, maybe explain to him (again) WHY these dolls are important to you, and that they;re meant for display, not play.  Maybe get a display case of some sort from a thrift store or something, and add a lock to it. My MIL has a HUGE baby doll collection that are not play dolls, and that's what she did with hers.

They broke into the room that is off limits (with the help of the husband most likely but that\u2019s besides the point) and damaged the collection.

I have in box dolls that are 12 years old, I have collector dolls that are worth $300+ now each. \n\nThose kids are old enough to understand they aren\u2019t for play, and the husband is DEFINITELY old enough to understand. If he supports her collecting he should also support that they are collectibles, not toys for their kids to lose accessories to and mess up their hair.
