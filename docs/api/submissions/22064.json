In April of 2022 he had asked me to quit my job or he would leave me so I did. (I ignored a lot of red flags with him because I loved him. Now that I\u2019m out of the marriage I realized it was all emotional, mental, psychological abuse.) After I quit my job I became a stay at home wife. I became very depressed and lonely. At the end of August, he asked me for a break, so I gave it to him. I went to California and while I was down there, he texted me on Snapchat asking me for a divorce. From there, he was very harsh. When I got back we did the divorce papers and I had put that he is to pay me $1000 a month for my car and car insurance because he had bought me a car and the payment was over $800 a month. I also put that he owes me an initial $2000 to get me on my feet. He signed and we filed. That leads us to today. He still hasn\u2019t paid me anything. As of today, he owes me about $13,000. He started dating his new girlfriend on my birthday and they are now expecting a baby. He won\u2019t tell me where he\u2019s working so that I can garnish his pay.
