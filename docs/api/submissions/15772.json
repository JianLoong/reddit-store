As a result, my brother(29M), who was 11 at the time, and I became very close. He's my main confidant, and vice versa. He's a very sensitive person, and both of us have always been very family orientated. I like to thank my dad for that.\n\n5 years ago, my niece, Samantha passed away from SIDS at 3 months old. My brother was the SAHP, (as am I). The only thing that seemed to get him through that was his wife, my SIL, and the fact that she promised him that they would try for another child again someday.\n\nI always thought it was a strange promise, but it's my SIL's business, and it became a sort of therapy for him. My SIL asked him not to talk about it, so he would call me. At first, it was almost every day after Samantha passed that one of us would call each other and just talk. For a while, he would often talk about Samantha and I would just console him. Then it slowly turned to talk of the future child. We haven't been talking as much recently, but he still occasionally sends me pictures of baby clothes and Disney movies.\n\nLast Tuesday, he called me, sobbing and begging me to let him stay with me. It turns out, he finally decided to broach the topic of trying for another child with my SIL, and she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\". I went and got him, and he's been staying with me, my wife(31F) and our son(5M) since then.\n\nHe's been basically inconsolable ever since. He's hardly eaten, or gotten out of bed. He stays in the guest room and I take food up to him and get him to eat. It's been fucking awful.\n\nMy wife wants him out, claiming it's \"time he went home\" and my SIL is saying he needs to \"man up\". I think it's unfair to demand I throw my brother out. I'm a SAHD, so it's not as if my wife is the one cleaning up after him, not that there's much to clean up at all. She also claims it's \"bad for our son to have him around like that.\" This is not true. Our son forgot he was here the other day. I told her no. I am not putting him out. He's my damn brother, and with the state he's in, I don't want to lose my other sibling.\n\nShe let my SIL into the house while I was out buying groceries the other day, and it didn't go well. She was heartless, to say the least, demanding he stop moping and leave with her. I told my wife and SIL to please leave him the fuck alone for now and asked my SIL to please leave the house. She left, but not without some choice words. My wife says I'm \"enabling\" my brother. I think he just needs someone to lean on until he's in a frame of mind to care for himself at the least. This is not a permanent situation, by any means.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I fully intend to get him to a therapist as soon as possible. I know this is above my skill set, by far, but right now I'm just doing the best I can until I can make that happen.

Has he been working? Does he get therapy or any help with grief processing? Or has he been at an emotional standstill for the past 5 years?", "NTA\n\nThere's no time limit on grief. In being told his wife doesn't actually want another child,  your brother has effectively picked up grieving where he left off years ago,  AND is now also grieving the future he thought he'd have,  where he got to be a father.  That's a major loss.  He's mourning the child he already lost,  the child he thought he would still get to have,  and a whole different life he had planned for. \n\nYour wife is being insensitive and his is being cruel.\n\nSide note: telling someone to \"man up\" is infuriating.", "NTA\n\n> she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\".\n\nHoly shit\n\nShe lied to him for FIVE YEARS\n\nIt\u2019s okay that she doesn\u2019t want another child. It\u2019s not okay to lie to your partner about this. \n\nI had sympathy for your wife right up until she let SIL in to bully your brother and even joined in. (Look, it sounds like you unilaterally decided on a semi-permanent guest. That\u2019s going to be a problem for some folks, especially with no clear end in sight. And it IS tough to live in a space with someone who is in that kind of depression.)\n\nYour brother isn\u2019t moping, he\u2019s grieving - not just the loss of a potential future, but likely his marriage as well.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think the marriage can survive this. (Nor so I think it should.)", "Your brother needs to get professional help for his grief.", "I\u2019m a mom. Just had my second daughter 3 weeks ago. If one of my kiddos was lost and my man did that crap to me, I\u2019d be single. Stringing someone along like that especially after a loss is often a deal breaker and people telling him to just get over it is pretty fcked up imo. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to stand up for your brother. NTA", "I think you should send your wife to go stay with sister-in-law, and you should help your brother see a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nAs suggested by someone else, your brother should see a professional grief counsellor. There is nothing 'unmanly' about grieving a dead child, but sometimes people need help to get past it.\n\nI would also suggest that if he and his wife have such wildly different visions for the future, they should probably part ways. And if that happens you'll need to support him, because it to me it sounds like he is in an abusive relationship, and it can be hard to leave those.", "Nta...\n\nMy God, those two women are heartless. He's been strung along for years, thinking when the times are right, we'll try, only to be told it's never going to happen.", "NTA it's been just over a week. He needs to process this and figure out what he wants to do. You mention you intend to get him into grief counseling; your wife needs to have patience, because he may come to the conclusion that he can no longer continue to be in a relationship with your SIL. There is no timeline with grief. The pain and loss will remain the same size and intensity as the day it was made; we just grow to accommodate it.", "NTA - this is very sad.", "NTA but your brother needs professional help. Letting him mentally waste away will not help him. He needs grief counseling to help him process the loss of his baby and to help him rebuild his life. He also may need to separate from his wife until he can figure out if he wants to continue with his marriage. \n\nYour wife and sil are being unnecessarily cruel. \n\nPlease get your brother help. He is way past the point of \"not coping\".", "NTA... his wife should of been honest and said no instead of lying.. your wife needs to let him be it's not like she see him or clean up after him... \nMaybe try getting  him into grieve counseling \n.", "NTA- his wife is the a-hole, and so is your wife, to be frank. his wife is as heartless as they come. and she sounds extremely controlling and toxic. he really needs to get out of that marriage, truly. and as for your wife, she does not sound family oriented. i would kick that woman to the curb for treating my brother that way.", "NTA and your wife is really cold. His wife is a monster, as far as I can tell.  Please try to get your brother some help. Hiding in your guest room is not going to be good for him.  Best of luck, that's a really shitty situation.", "NTA... youve already described it perfectly yourself \"heartless\".\n\nYou are being a tremendous brother and he is lucky to have you, professional therapy would be a good thing for him to pursue as well though. Three close family members passing in tragic ways and then his wife and your wife being mixtures of dismissive and cruel towards him. Keep him close and love each other as best as you can.", "Your brother needs therapy ASAP. You need therapy ASAP. \nFocus on that. You two have some serious unresolved trauma, arrested development and PTSD issues to address. This has nothing to do with anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good brother and I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds horrible. She lied to your brother for years, and when he found out, he was devastated. You are looking out for your brother and giving him time to figure out what to do about his marriage. If your wife cannot be understanding, and is allowing your SIL to confront him, when he's made it clear he doesn't want to talk to her, perhaps your wife should go and live with the SIL for a while.", "NTA. His whole recovery is based on a lie to make him feel better, and now he is being told to 'man up' and it's 'time to get home'. God, I feel so bad for him. \n\nGet him the professional help he needs and get him out of that marriage. She shouldn't have lied about something like that to end up in telling him to \"man up\". She destroyed him.", "NTA. Not only has he lost his child, whom he cared for and spent every day with, but the person who is supposed to be his partner in life has lied to him and belittled his emotions while crushing all hopes he built up for the future.\n\nI'm sure your SIL is grieving in her own way, but this is worrisome behavior, almost like she blames him.\n\nAnd what is wrong with your wife? Unbelievable behavior and completely unsupportive of you when you need to be there for your brother.", "NTA at all. The sil, however, is an AH the size of Jupiter.\n\nMan, you and your bro have been through so much tragedy and pain for being so young. The support system you have with each other is pretty unique and inspiring. That being said, you said yourself that you can't just let him stay in your guest room forever. He should talk with a professional, either 1 on 1 or in a support group. My buddy went through the same devastating misfortune and tried both. He said the support group opened his eyes, and it pretty much saved him. It was a safe space filled with empathy where he could process everything in a healthy way. He's even drinking buddies with a bunch of the guys to this day. Seems like you're his 1 on 1 \"therapist,\" so maybe accompany him to some group sessions to get him out of bed. It can only help. \n\nNow for the other incredibly important issue - the sil. She's as evil as they come. Telling someone to \"man up\" or \"be a man\" is a very toxic thing to say. That's pretty much like saying: be tough and repress your feelings instead of dealing with them. He needs to work through these feelings in a constructive manner, not just bury them and move on.\n\nYou should respect your wife's wishes to help him move forward and out of the house, but definitely NOT into sil's arms. The fact that she admitted she said they'd try for another baby right afterward just to console him, and that she never had any intention of that is fucked up on so many levels. If you send him back to her, she's gonna be spiteful and hurtful and pile on, thus sending your brother down an even darker road than he is on now. All of her actions you've put forth so far are incredibly callous, and what she says is even more nasty and harmful. Your brother is in a very vulnerable place, and you are doing well to protect him. Now help him move forward. Your wife seems supportive as well, but she's probably right when she says he needs to move forward...just not alone with sil.\n\nGood luck with everything, as it's a tough situation with no clear \"right\" answers, but with your help, your bro will recover.", "NTA you are totally in the right to protect and help your brother.", "NTA at all. Everyone grieves in their own way and he needs time to heal. SIL sounds really manipulative and selfish. It's ok for her to not want to go through that again but she shouldn't have given your brother false hope and lied to him for this long. He definitely needs you right now and who knows what this means for his marriage. Only time will tell. He shouldn't be bullied into bottling his feelings either.", "NTA, the wife just ripped threw his healing heart and threw away the pieces! You both need some counseling to see why both your wives don\u2019t seem to have empathy. \n\nYou\u2019re a good brother", "NAH, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything to help your brother in a meaningful way.  He\u2019s been clinging to the idea of another child for five years as a way to avoid dealing with his grief.  Now he\u2019s hiding at your house to continue to avoid dealing with it.  He needs grief counseling.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Do you know for certain that SIL promised him another child outright and then reneged? As in, has she confirmed it or did you witness a conversation? I don\u2019t mean simply saying, \u201cWell this is something we\u2019ll talk about\u201d but outright said it would happen.\n\nBecause if she did then she is TA. But if she didn\u2019t then this situation is way more complicated than it appears.", "Wow, that's heartbreaking.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. He needs therapy for sure and possibly a divorce", "NTA - You are a great sister , your brother needs therapy to deal better with the lost", "Yeah soft YTA\n\nI get that you two are very close, and you are very protective after losing your mom, and sister at such a young age, but he has to get out of your house, go home, and deal with this with his wife. \n\nHe's a grown man who ran away from home, because he doesn't want to have to deal with his own problems. What his wife did was really dishonest, and hurtful, and if he really wants another child that badly, then it's time to get a divorce, and find someone else who wants the same thing. \n\nHowever you do not get to unilaterally decide that someone can move into your home. If your wife wants him out, he's out. Period.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nYour brother needs to grow up. I can't even imagine a grown ass man being this broken up over their partner not wanting another kid.
