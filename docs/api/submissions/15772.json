As a result, my brother(29M), who was 11 at the time, and I became very close. He's my main confidant, and vice versa. He's a very sensitive person, and both of us have always been very family orientated. I like to thank my dad for that.\n\n5 years ago, my niece, Samantha passed away from SIDS at 3 months old. My brother was the SAHP, (as am I). The only thing that seemed to get him through that was his wife, my SIL, and the fact that she promised him that they would try for another child again someday.\n\nI always thought it was a strange promise, but it's my SIL's business, and it became a sort of therapy for him. My SIL asked him not to talk about it, so he would call me. At first, it was almost every day after Samantha passed that one of us would call each other and just talk. For a while, he would often talk about Samantha and I would just console him. Then it slowly turned to talk of the future child. We haven't been talking as much recently, but he still occasionally sends me pictures of baby clothes and Disney movies.\n\nLast Tuesday, he called me, sobbing and begging me to let him stay with me. It turns out, he finally decided to broach the topic of trying for another child with my SIL, and she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\". I went and got him, and he's been staying with me, my wife(31F) and our son(5M) since then.\n\nHe's been basically inconsolable ever since. He's hardly eaten, or gotten out of bed. He stays in the guest room and I take food up to him and get him to eat. It's been fucking awful.\n\nMy wife wants him out, claiming it's \"time he went home\" and my SIL is saying he needs to \"man up\". I think it's unfair to demand I throw my brother out. I'm a SAHD, so it's not as if my wife is the one cleaning up after him, not that there's much to clean up at all. She also claims it's \"bad for our son to have him around like that.\" This is not true. Our son forgot he was here the other day. I told her no. I am not putting him out. He's my damn brother, and with the state he's in, I don't want to lose my other sibling.\n\nShe let my SIL into the house while I was out buying groceries the other day, and it didn't go well. She was heartless, to say the least, demanding he stop moping and leave with her. I told my wife and SIL to please leave him the fuck alone for now and asked my SIL to please leave the house. She left, but not without some choice words. My wife says I'm \"enabling\" my brother. I think he just needs someone to lean on until he's in a frame of mind to care for himself at the least. This is not a permanent situation, by any means.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I fully intend to get him to a therapist as soon as possible. I know this is above my skill set, by far, but right now I'm just doing the best I can until I can make that happen.\n\nEdit 2: I was told it would be good to add the fact that only my SIL got grief counseling after Samantha passed due to them not having the money to, and her wanting to go on her own.

Has he been working? Does he get therapy or any help with grief processing? Or has he been at an emotional standstill for the past 5 years?", "NTA\n\nThere's no time limit on grief. In being told his wife doesn't actually want another child,  your brother has effectively picked up grieving where he left off years ago,  AND is now also grieving the future he thought he'd have,  where he got to be a father.  That's a major loss.  He's mourning the child he already lost,  the child he thought he would still get to have,  and a whole different life he had planned for. \n\nYour wife is being insensitive and his is being cruel.\n\nSide note: telling someone to \"man up\" is infuriating.", "NTA\n\n> she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\".\n\nHoly shit\n\nShe lied to him for FIVE YEARS\n\nIt\u2019s okay that she doesn\u2019t want another child. It\u2019s not okay to lie to your partner about this. \n\nI had sympathy for your wife right up until she let SIL in to bully your brother and even joined in. (Look, it sounds like you unilaterally decided on a semi-permanent guest. That\u2019s going to be a problem for some folks, especially with no clear end in sight. And it IS tough to live in a space with someone who is in that kind of depression.)\n\nYour brother isn\u2019t moping, he\u2019s grieving - not just the loss of a potential future, but likely his marriage as well.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think the marriage can survive this. (Nor so I think it should.)", "Your brother needs to get professional help for his grief.", "I\u2019m a mom. Just had my second daughter 3 weeks ago. If one of my kiddos was lost and my man did that crap to me, I\u2019d be single. Stringing someone along like that especially after a loss is often a deal breaker and people telling him to just get over it is pretty fcked up imo. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to stand up for your brother. NTA", "I think you should send your wife to go stay with sister-in-law, and you should help your brother see a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nAs suggested by someone else, your brother should see a professional grief counsellor. There is nothing 'unmanly' about grieving a dead child, but sometimes people need help to get past it.\n\nI would also suggest that if he and his wife have such wildly different visions for the future, they should probably part ways. And if that happens you'll need to support him, because it to me it sounds like he is in an abusive relationship, and it can be hard to leave those.", "Nta...\n\nMy God, those two women are heartless. He's been strung along for years, thinking when the times are right, we'll try, only to be told it's never going to happen.", "NTA it's been just over a week. He needs to process this and figure out what he wants to do. You mention you intend to get him into grief counseling; your wife needs to have patience, because he may come to the conclusion that he can no longer continue to be in a relationship with your SIL. There is no timeline with grief. The pain and loss will remain the same size and intensity as the day it was made; we just grow to accommodate it.", "NTA - this is very sad.", "NTA but your brother needs professional help. Letting him mentally waste away will not help him. He needs grief counseling to help him process the loss of his baby and to help him rebuild his life. He also may need to separate from his wife until he can figure out if he wants to continue with his marriage. \n\nYour wife and sil are being unnecessarily cruel. \n\nPlease get your brother help. He is way past the point of \"not coping\".", "NTA... his wife should of been honest and said no instead of lying.. your wife needs to let him be it's not like she see him or clean up after him... \nMaybe try getting  him into grieve counseling \n.", "NTA- his wife is the a-hole, and so is your wife, to be frank. his wife is as heartless as they come. and she sounds extremely controlling and toxic. he really needs to get out of that marriage, truly. and as for your wife, she does not sound family oriented. i would kick that woman to the curb for treating my brother that way.", "NTA and your wife is really cold. His wife is a monster, as far as I can tell.  Please try to get your brother some help. Hiding in your guest room is not going to be good for him.  Best of luck, that's a really shitty situation.", "NTA... youve already described it perfectly yourself \"heartless\".\n\nYou are being a tremendous brother and he is lucky to have you, professional therapy would be a good thing for him to pursue as well though. Three close family members passing in tragic ways and then his wife and your wife being mixtures of dismissive and cruel towards him. Keep him close and love each other as best as you can.", "Your brother needs therapy ASAP. You need therapy ASAP. \nFocus on that. You two have some serious unresolved trauma, arrested development and PTSD issues to address. This has nothing to do with anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good brother and I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds horrible. She lied to your brother for years, and when he found out, he was devastated. You are looking out for your brother and giving him time to figure out what to do about his marriage. If your wife cannot be understanding, and is allowing your SIL to confront him, when he's made it clear he doesn't want to talk to her, perhaps your wife should go and live with the SIL for a while.", "NTA. His whole recovery is based on a lie to make him feel better, and now he is being told to 'man up' and it's 'time to get home'. God, I feel so bad for him. \n\nGet him the professional help he needs and get him out of that marriage. She shouldn't have lied about something like that to end up in telling him to \"man up\". She destroyed him.", "NTA. Not only has he lost his child, whom he cared for and spent every day with, but the person who is supposed to be his partner in life has lied to him and belittled his emotions while crushing all hopes he built up for the future.\n\nI'm sure your SIL is grieving in her own way, but this is worrisome behavior, almost like she blames him.\n\nAnd what is wrong with your wife? Unbelievable behavior and completely unsupportive of you when you need to be there for your brother.", "NTA at all. The sil, however, is an AH the size of Jupiter.\n\nMan, you and your bro have been through so much tragedy and pain for being so young. The support system you have with each other is pretty unique and inspiring. That being said, you said yourself that you can't just let him stay in your guest room forever. He should talk with a professional, either 1 on 1 or in a support group. My buddy went through the same devastating misfortune and tried both. He said the support group opened his eyes, and it pretty much saved him. It was a safe space filled with empathy where he could process everything in a healthy way. He's even drinking buddies with a bunch of the guys to this day. Seems like you're his 1 on 1 \"therapist,\" so maybe accompany him to some group sessions to get him out of bed. It can only help. \n\nNow for the other incredibly important issue - the sil. She's as evil as they come. Telling someone to \"man up\" or \"be a man\" is a very toxic thing to say. That's pretty much like saying: be tough and repress your feelings instead of dealing with them. He needs to work through these feelings in a constructive manner, not just bury them and move on.\n\nYou should respect your wife's wishes to help him move forward and out of the house, but definitely NOT into sil's arms. The fact that she admitted she said they'd try for another baby right afterward just to console him, and that she never had any intention of that is fucked up on so many levels. If you send him back to her, she's gonna be spiteful and hurtful and pile on, thus sending your brother down an even darker road than he is on now. All of her actions you've put forth so far are incredibly callous, and what she says is even more nasty and harmful. Your brother is in a very vulnerable place, and you are doing well to protect him. Now help him move forward. Your wife seems supportive as well, but she's probably right when she says he needs to move forward...just not alone with sil.\n\nGood luck with everything, as it's a tough situation with no clear \"right\" answers, but with your help, your bro will recover.", "NTA you are totally in the right to protect and help your brother.", "NTA at all. Everyone grieves in their own way and he needs time to heal. SIL sounds really manipulative and selfish. It's ok for her to not want to go through that again but she shouldn't have given your brother false hope and lied to him for this long. He definitely needs you right now and who knows what this means for his marriage. Only time will tell. He shouldn't be bullied into bottling his feelings either.", "NTA, the wife just ripped threw his healing heart and threw away the pieces! You both need some counseling to see why both your wives don\u2019t seem to have empathy. \n\nYou\u2019re a good brother", "NAH, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything to help your brother in a meaningful way.  He\u2019s been clinging to the idea of another child for five years as a way to avoid dealing with his grief.  Now he\u2019s hiding at your house to continue to avoid dealing with it.  He needs grief counseling.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Do you know for certain that SIL promised him another child outright and then reneged? As in, has she confirmed it or did you witness a conversation? I don\u2019t mean simply saying, \u201cWell this is something we\u2019ll talk about\u201d but outright said it would happen.\n\nBecause if she did then she is TA. But if she didn\u2019t then this situation is way more complicated than it appears.", "Wow, that's heartbreaking.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. He needs therapy for sure and possibly a divorce", "NTA - You are a great sister , your brother needs therapy to deal better with the lost", "Yeah soft YTA\n\nI get that you two are very close, and you are very protective after losing your mom, and sister at such a young age, but he has to get out of your house, go home, and deal with this with his wife. \n\nHe's a grown man who ran away from home, because he doesn't want to have to deal with his own problems. What his wife did was really dishonest, and hurtful, and if he really wants another child that badly, then it's time to get a divorce, and find someone else who wants the same thing. \n\nHowever you do not get to unilaterally decide that someone can move into your home. If your wife wants him out, he's out. Period.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nYour brother needs to grow up. I can't even imagine a grown ass man being this broken up over their partner not wanting another kid.

When you live with someone, who can never do that, especially when the person living with you (in this case, your wife) has not been consulted and clearly doesn't want him there.\n2. Your wife sucks for having absolutely no sympathy for your brother and then allowing your SIL in the house to try to bully him back home. That's cruel and horrible to do to someone, irregardless of him being an unwanted houseguest. Her anger should be solely at you, not him.\n3. Your SIL sucks for apparently lying to her husband for five years, for trying to hunt him down when he's trying to process this news, for that sexist \"be a man\" comment (if someone told her to \"be a woman and have another kid\", that person would get destroyed, so why is it OK to say that crap back?), and for failing to get him the help he needed. In that last part, I'd say you suck too.\n4.

Right now she\u2019s desperate to have him home; she\u2019s either going to make false promises like I said, or she\u2019s going to continue to call names and try to make him think he\u2019s the bad guy (so he just swallows his pain down and gives her what she wants). \n\n**Now onto your wife, she\u2019s by far the bigger asshole out of her & your SIL. I thought SIL was cruel and heartless, but man she really has her out done**. I honestly don\u2019t get what her damage is, either she really is just a naturally apathetic person or there\u2019s more to the story. The fact she\u2019s not appalled SIL lied tells me she likely knew about it all along. She likely feels sympathy for her and not your brother (which I don\u2019t get they both lost their child), the only thing that makes sense is it\u2019s because she\u2019s a girl; or because she thinks your brother owes it SIL to be miserable for the sake of her being happy. **There\u2019s also the whole other layer of the additional loses you and your brother have lived through. You\u2019re absolutely right that if he just goes home and sucks it up one day you\u2019re going to wake up to a call from the corners office, one person can only lose so many people, and be hurt so much before they just give up. This isn\u2019t some petty \u201cyou forgot to take out the trash\u201d squabble, this is a traumatic issue with zero compromise. At this point op: you have to ask yourself if you\u2019re willing to burn your marriage down to save your brothers life, because that\u2019s likely where you\u2019re at**. \n \n**Your wife\u2019s actions show me that it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or do; there is nothing you can do to convince her, or squeeze even an ounce of empathy for your brother. That\u2019s not something that even if your brother and SIL work it out, you will be able to fix in your own marriage long term. Your marriage is as good as over and much as theirs is**. I also feel the need to tell you that \u201ca broken family\u201d doesn\u2019t hurt the kids so long as you\u2019re present, and they\u2019re still relatively young. By relatively young I mean middle school or younger, and even then if they\u2019re older, it\u2019s still better to see their parents thriving apart than together and resentful. I\u2019m speaking from experience too, my parents are divorced. Not one day of my life did I resent that they weren\u2019t together, or did their divorce hurt me. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known, the only thing that I ever cared about was that they were both always there for me. I\u2019m not saying this to bullshit you or manipulate you either, it\u2019s the gods honest truth. Don\u2019t worry about how you\u2019ll make it outside of being with her either, talk to an attorney you\u2019d be entitled to spousal support during the divorce proceedings before it\u2019s finalized and before you find out if you\u2019re being awarded alimony permanently. \n\n**ETA:** You\u2019d also still have access to you\u2019re shared bank account before then also. The concept is so the insolvent spouse has a way to live, and so both spouses are on equal terms in terms of being able to attorney\u2019s or equal stature. You being a SAHD also heavily goes in your favor, in terms of custody and child support. Don\u2019t be scared of the idea because of how hard it\u2019ll be or how it\u2019ll play out. You\u2019re holding more cards than she is if it came down to a divorce. **If you\u2019re not there yet but feel like you may be, if she doesn\u2019t back down tell her that. Sit her down and lay out your feelings and intentions firmly. Tell her that if it comes down to choosing her or your brother you\u2019ll chose your brother, so she needs to decide if sticking her nose in their marital problems is worth costing her her own marriage**. I still suggest you and your brother see a lawyer though, you don\u2019t have to hire them or sign anything. It would just be a consultation where they\u2019d inform you about the divorce laws specific to your state, and what to expect. You could go and never think or bring it up again, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re filing tomorrow; just that you\u2019re aware of what would happen and what you\u2019d need to do if it came to that.", "Are you sure that your sister-in-law did therapy?

Due to medical issues that arose after we married and had started trying I miscarried 4 times and we decided that we would stop and that was that. After the initial wounds healed I told him that we could discuss adoption but also that I understood that this was not what he had pictured for his life (I have mostly recovered now but I was quite seriously ill still back then and there was no guarantee I would get better). I told him that I wanted him to spend some time and think seriously about the situation and since we were still young enough to start over I wanted him to be honest with himself and decide if life as it had become would be enough for him.

Cause I can\u2019t see why she\u2019s making it seem like he\u2019s been there for months", "That's a really reasonable amount of time.  I'm sorry it's causing strife in your relationship but I think your wife should consider that this is a totally normal thing for families to do for each other, even if hers was never like that.  She a bit of a career driven type?  Less than gregarious/more introverted socially?", "It almost makes me wonder if she can show empathy and compassion toward her son.", "Bot", "Yeah, I think there are quite a lot of people struggling out there with not a lot of support.  I don't particularly care what gender or sexuality anyone is.  I just wish people would care for each other a little more.", "Stringing someone along like that especially after a loss is often a deal breaker and people telling him to just get over it is pretty fcked up imo.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to stand up for your brother. NTA", "Bot", "Yours is a marriage worth taking notes on, because this is how it's supposed to be.\n\nMy wife and I decided against having kids, due to age/finances/world status/etc.\n\nWhen we started, we talked about having three, and even had names picked out for all three. Then she got a job nannying, and was handed a 1, 2, and 5 year old, and raised them for 6 years. I got to do a few cool things with them occasionally, and support my wife through all the sweetness and frustrations that came along with it.\n\nAfter she left that job, we had a long talk about where we were, regarding our own kids, and where we both needed to be. It took lots of conversations, soul-searching, repeated check-ins, etc...but we made the right choice.....especially after having gone through covid, and what the world has turned into since then.\n\nI hope that the BOTH of you are always able to look over your shoulder, and see your partner guarding your back and supporting you. There is a peace and a comfort in that feeling, that is simply unexplainable.", "He is working. My SIL cut down on her hours because her job was mentally demanding and she couldn't handle it full-time, so they don't have any more money than they did.  And to be fair, yes, her job absolutely was demanding.", "This is what I'm seeing is the major issue. Like the SIL has been supporting him financially for YEARS. \n\nAnd if he can't even get a part time job to help out with household bills, get out of bed, help them to be able to pay for his own therapy... why on earth would she want another child with this man??", "That\u2019s because it\u2019s fucking atrocious and doesn\u2019t deserve a response.", "Wife had to pay for her own therapy... \n\nOPs brother didn't work for 5 years.", "As if she wouldn't have been struggling the whole time too? \n\nShe would have likely had to return to work shortly after the kid's death if they are in the USA. \n\n\nShe didn't have the choice or option to stay at home for 5 years, without a job, because she had to keep a roof over their heads. \n\n\nShe got therapy because she had a job, but she still would have stuggled for a long while until therapy started helping her create coping mechanisms.", "So, who do you think is suggesting that's the fairly callous transaction that's taking place here?  What do you think this man is grieving?", "OK how many times have we read about people refusing to go to therapy or making excuses to avoid it on this subreddit? IDK about you, but I know I've read tons of them. He's reach 5 years of not going to therapy. I could by the financial excuse to a certain point, but not half a decade. According to one of OP's comments, his brother hasn't worked in the 5 years sense his daughters death. So if money was the continued problem, there's nothing stopping him from getting a part-time job solely to pay for the counseling, if it was something he wanted to do. At some point, not being able to afford therapy became a willing choice to avoid therapy.", "How have you not noticed that you're the \"butthurt\" person with their \"knickers in a twist\" that needs to relax? It's you, bb. You're the one that threw out PTSD (look at you for knowing terms! winky face). \n\nSeriously tho, step back, read this exchange and grow from it because everything about your reaction is extra.", "your argument is:\n\n* she never told him they'd try again in the future five years ago. not the first time, and not the second when he asked and she confirmed but asked him to not bring it up again and said she would when she was ready  \n* she never insisted on going to therapy alone   \n* she didn't tell him now that she lied to him five years ago   \n\nbecause he's traumatised therefore nothing he says he experienced can be trusted   \n\nmeanwhile OP has verified that his SIL isn't respecting his brother's boundaries, screamed at him to man up, etc\n\nbut no, you still can't judge SIL an AH and harmful even though just that behaviour is extremely so, and you refuse to believe a single word that brother has said for honestly no fucking reason\n\nthis whole thing is gross as hell and you should be ashamed", "His wife is demanding he kick out his brother while he is extremely concerned about his mental state and while his wife is being terrible to him. That's extraordinarily shitty.", "If OP is giving himself peace of mind by letting his brother stay with him and making sure he isn't going to do something to himself until he can get him into therapy is disrespecting his wife, then so be it. If something happened to the brother when he returned home because of his wife's bullying, I'm sure that OPs marriage wouldn't survive. And if she's going to be angry and resentful towards OP, the marriage won't survive either. I'm sure OP would rather have a pissed off (ex) wife that is alive than live with the guilt and grief if his brother didn't get the help he needed at home.\n\nLife is ugly sometimes. Sometimes, we NEED to show compassion and do things that we don't want to do in order to ensure our family members or friends are ok. Mental health issues are real, and unfortunately, our healthcare system doesn't see it that way, placing the brunt of the care on friends and family of the person affected. \n\nI have a justnomil that is truly awful. She has mental health issues that she doesn't acknowledge that flares up every few years. I CANNOT stand the woman. However, when her issues flare up and when she locks herself in her house for months without doing any self care, I go over and take care of her. I buy her groceries, I take her abuse while trying to get her to brush her damn teeth, shower, and wash her hair. I force her to put on clean clothes, clean the trash up out of the house, do some laundry, and change the sheets on her bed. Why??? It's not because I like her. It's because despite all her faults, she raised my husband and his siblings, and she is the grandmother to my children. It's because she needs the help at times until she can get a spot in the mental health ward at the hospital (which is usually 6 to 8 weeks wait time in my area unless the person is actively hurting themselves).And even though she wouldn't lift a finger to help me when I had health issues, I will help her again in a couple of years when she spirals again. All because my husband and kids love her. Sometimes, we have to do things we don't want to in order to make sure someone is safe. It's not enabling, especially if you are filling a void until the appropriate help can be received.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry for your loss. I can not imagine your pain. I hope that your heart heals a little bit every day.", "He does have a job", "that makes zero fucking sense. we know when people make excuses to avoid therapy because they tell us those excuses. not because they get busted for lying\n\nyou're accusing him of actively lying in an extreme way, saying that he refused to go to therapy with his wife and then lied and said she refused to let him come with her\n\nthere's literally no basis for that assumption at all\n\nand the post describes him handling his grief better over time and he probably thought he was doing better than he was. his breakdown is not only his returning to his initial state of grief, but also because his wife lied to him about something huge for five years   \n\nlook you don't like the guy so you're basically willing to assume he's lying about everything despite zero reason to, and you're assuming lots of positive things about his wife despite zero reason to. if you want to make up a fantasy story and comment on that, go to writing prompts", "No, my argument is that there are some odd things in his brother\u2019s approach to this matter that may mean this situation is not what it appears on the surface. I am not saying I\u2019m right. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s something to look at before deciding what to do here. \n\nOP has made some references in his post that suggest his brother could do something if not supported properly or at least that he\u2019s concerned about this. Now IF, and this is an IF, his brother has had some sort of grief denial come crashing down around him the risk of harm is enormous and he needs the right help for that. I am only concerned about his brother\u2019s welfare and I would much prefer to be wrong on this than right I can assure you. \n\nI said right at the beginning that if everything is accurate then she is TA.", "And that\u2019s not going on. He isn\u2019t forcing her to do anything. She lied to him for five years.", "Now *your* the one ignoring the main question: why five years of no therapy?", "there's absolutely nothing about his brother's current state of mind or behaviour that suggests you should question his grip on reality, which is what you're doing\n\nand it would be an absolutely terrible idea for OP to go to his SIL for her side of the story here and then base his choices off of what she says   \n\nno therapist would suggest any of what you're suggesting on the basis of this story. it really sounds like you're projecting your own issues here\n\nand even if you assume what the brother said isn't accurate, his wife would still be a massive fucking asshole because just the behaviour that OP has seen is enough for her to be declared TA", "you could read my previous comment", "lol people hearing what they want from a conversation is not the same as \"questioning their grip on reality\" like you're making it out to be", "except that's not what's being questioned here. this isn't one vague conversation. they're talking about several different conversations, years ago, and this week. several different conversations about different things\n\nand some of the things are absolutely stuff that the brother definitely did not want to hear"]}
