As a result, my brother(29M), who was 11 at the time, and I became very close. He's my main confidant, and vice versa. He's a very sensitive person, and both of us have always been very family orientated. I like to thank my dad for that.\n\n5 years ago, my niece, Samantha passed away from SIDS at 3 months old. My brother was the SAHP, (as am I). The only thing that seemed to get him through that was his wife, my SIL, and the fact that she promised him that they would try for another child again someday.\n\nI always thought it was a strange promise, but it's my SIL's business, and it became a sort of therapy for him. My SIL asked him not to talk about it, so he would call me. At first, it was almost every day after Samantha passed that one of us would call each other and just talk. For a while, he would often talk about Samantha and I would just console him. Then it slowly turned to talk of the future child. We haven't been talking as much recently, but he still occasionally sends me pictures of baby clothes and Disney movies.\n\nLast Tuesday, he called me, sobbing and begging me to let him stay with me. It turns out, he finally decided to broach the topic of trying for another child with my SIL, and she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\". I went and got him, and he's been staying with me, my wife(31F) and our son(5M) since then.\n\nHe's been basically inconsolable ever since. He's hardly eaten, or gotten out of bed. He stays in the guest room and I take food up to him and get him to eat. It's been fucking awful.\n\nMy wife wants him out, claiming it's \"time he went home\" and my SIL is saying he needs to \"man up\". I think it's unfair to demand I throw my brother out. I'm a SAHD, so it's not as if my wife is the one cleaning up after him, not that there's much to clean up at all. She also claims it's \"bad for our son to have him around like that.\" This is not true. Our son forgot he was here the other day. I told her no. I am not putting him out. He's my damn brother, and with the state he's in, I don't want to lose my other sibling.\n\nShe let my SIL into the house while I was out buying groceries the other day, and it didn't go well. She was heartless, to say the least, demanding he stop moping and leave with her. I told my wife and SIL to please leave him the fuck alone for now and asked my SIL to please leave the house. She left, but not without some choice words. My wife says I'm \"enabling\" my brother. I think he just needs someone to lean on until he's in a frame of mind to care for himself at the least. This is not a permanent situation, by any means.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I fully intend to get him to a therapist as soon as possible. I know this is above my skill set, by far, but right now I'm just doing the best I can until I can make that happen.\n\nEdit 2: I was told it would be good to add the fact that only my SIL got grief counseling after Samantha passed due to them not having the money to, and her wanting to go on her own.

Has he been working? Does he get therapy or any help with grief processing? Or has he been at an emotional standstill for the past 5 years?", "NTA\n\nThere's no time limit on grief. In being told his wife doesn't actually want another child,  your brother has effectively picked up grieving where he left off years ago,  AND is now also grieving the future he thought he'd have,  where he got to be a father.  That's a major loss.  He's mourning the child he already lost,  the child he thought he would still get to have,  and a whole different life he had planned for. \n\nYour wife is being insensitive and his is being cruel.\n\nSide note: telling someone to \"man up\" is infuriating.", "NTA\n\n> she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\".\n\nHoly shit\n\nShe lied to him for FIVE YEARS\n\nIt\u2019s okay that she doesn\u2019t want another child. It\u2019s not okay to lie to your partner about this. \n\nI had sympathy for your wife right up until she let SIL in to bully your brother and even joined in. (Look, it sounds like you unilaterally decided on a semi-permanent guest. That\u2019s going to be a problem for some folks, especially with no clear end in sight. And it IS tough to live in a space with someone who is in that kind of depression.)\n\nYour brother isn\u2019t moping, he\u2019s grieving - not just the loss of a potential future, but likely his marriage as well.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think the marriage can survive this. (Nor so I think it should.)", "Your brother needs to get professional help for his grief.", "I\u2019m a mom. Just had my second daughter 3 weeks ago. If one of my kiddos was lost and my man did that crap to me, I\u2019d be single. Stringing someone along like that especially after a loss is often a deal breaker and people telling him to just get over it is pretty fcked up imo. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to stand up for your brother. NTA", "I think you should send your wife to go stay with sister-in-law, and you should help your brother see a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nAs suggested by someone else, your brother should see a professional grief counsellor. There is nothing 'unmanly' about grieving a dead child, but sometimes people need help to get past it.\n\nI would also suggest that if he and his wife have such wildly different visions for the future, they should probably part ways. And if that happens you'll need to support him, because it to me it sounds like he is in an abusive relationship, and it can be hard to leave those.", "Nta...\n\nMy God, those two women are heartless. He's been strung along for years, thinking when the times are right, we'll try, only to be told it's never going to happen.", "NTA it's been just over a week. He needs to process this and figure out what he wants to do. You mention you intend to get him into grief counseling; your wife needs to have patience, because he may come to the conclusion that he can no longer continue to be in a relationship with your SIL. There is no timeline with grief. The pain and loss will remain the same size and intensity as the day it was made; we just grow to accommodate it.", "NTA - this is very sad.", "NTA but your brother needs professional help. Letting him mentally waste away will not help him. He needs grief counseling to help him process the loss of his baby and to help him rebuild his life. He also may need to separate from his wife until he can figure out if he wants to continue with his marriage. \n\nYour wife and sil are being unnecessarily cruel. \n\nPlease get your brother help. He is way past the point of \"not coping\".", "NTA... his wife should of been honest and said no instead of lying.. your wife needs to let him be it's not like she see him or clean up after him... \nMaybe try getting  him into grieve counseling \n.", "NTA- his wife is the a-hole, and so is your wife, to be frank. his wife is as heartless as they come. and she sounds extremely controlling and toxic. he really needs to get out of that marriage, truly. and as for your wife, she does not sound family oriented. i would kick that woman to the curb for treating my brother that way.", "NTA and your wife is really cold. His wife is a monster, as far as I can tell.  Please try to get your brother some help. Hiding in your guest room is not going to be good for him.  Best of luck, that's a really shitty situation.", "NTA... youve already described it perfectly yourself \"heartless\".\n\nYou are being a tremendous brother and he is lucky to have you, professional therapy would be a good thing for him to pursue as well though. Three close family members passing in tragic ways and then his wife and your wife being mixtures of dismissive and cruel towards him. Keep him close and love each other as best as you can.", "Your brother needs therapy ASAP. You need therapy ASAP. \nFocus on that. You two have some serious unresolved trauma, arrested development and PTSD issues to address. This has nothing to do with anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good brother and I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds horrible. She lied to your brother for years, and when he found out, he was devastated. You are looking out for your brother and giving him time to figure out what to do about his marriage. If your wife cannot be understanding, and is allowing your SIL to confront him, when he's made it clear he doesn't want to talk to her, perhaps your wife should go and live with the SIL for a while.", "NTA. His whole recovery is based on a lie to make him feel better, and now he is being told to 'man up' and it's 'time to get home'. God, I feel so bad for him. \n\nGet him the professional help he needs and get him out of that marriage. She shouldn't have lied about something like that to end up in telling him to \"man up\". She destroyed him.", "NTA. Not only has he lost his child, whom he cared for and spent every day with, but the person who is supposed to be his partner in life has lied to him and belittled his emotions while crushing all hopes he built up for the future.\n\nI'm sure your SIL is grieving in her own way, but this is worrisome behavior, almost like she blames him.\n\nAnd what is wrong with your wife? Unbelievable behavior and completely unsupportive of you when you need to be there for your brother.", "NTA at all. The sil, however, is an AH the size of Jupiter.\n\nMan, you and your bro have been through so much tragedy and pain for being so young. The support system you have with each other is pretty unique and inspiring. That being said, you said yourself that you can't just let him stay in your guest room forever. He should talk with a professional, either 1 on 1 or in a support group. My buddy went through the same devastating misfortune and tried both. He said the support group opened his eyes, and it pretty much saved him. It was a safe space filled with empathy where he could process everything in a healthy way. He's even drinking buddies with a bunch of the guys to this day. Seems like you're his 1 on 1 \"therapist,\" so maybe accompany him to some group sessions to get him out of bed. It can only help. \n\nNow for the other incredibly important issue - the sil. She's as evil as they come. Telling someone to \"man up\" or \"be a man\" is a very toxic thing to say. That's pretty much like saying: be tough and repress your feelings instead of dealing with them. He needs to work through these feelings in a constructive manner, not just bury them and move on.\n\nYou should respect your wife's wishes to help him move forward and out of the house, but definitely NOT into sil's arms. The fact that she admitted she said they'd try for another baby right afterward just to console him, and that she never had any intention of that is fucked up on so many levels. If you send him back to her, she's gonna be spiteful and hurtful and pile on, thus sending your brother down an even darker road than he is on now. All of her actions you've put forth so far are incredibly callous, and what she says is even more nasty and harmful. Your brother is in a very vulnerable place, and you are doing well to protect him. Now help him move forward. Your wife seems supportive as well, but she's probably right when she says he needs to move forward...just not alone with sil.\n\nGood luck with everything, as it's a tough situation with no clear \"right\" answers, but with your help, your bro will recover.", "NTA you are totally in the right to protect and help your brother.", "NTA at all. Everyone grieves in their own way and he needs time to heal. SIL sounds really manipulative and selfish. It's ok for her to not want to go through that again but she shouldn't have given your brother false hope and lied to him for this long. He definitely needs you right now and who knows what this means for his marriage. Only time will tell. He shouldn't be bullied into bottling his feelings either.", "NTA, the wife just ripped threw his healing heart and threw away the pieces! You both need some counseling to see why both your wives don\u2019t seem to have empathy. \n\nYou\u2019re a good brother", "NAH, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything to help your brother in a meaningful way.  He\u2019s been clinging to the idea of another child for five years as a way to avoid dealing with his grief.  Now he\u2019s hiding at your house to continue to avoid dealing with it.  He needs grief counseling.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Do you know for certain that SIL promised him another child outright and then reneged? As in, has she confirmed it or did you witness a conversation? I don\u2019t mean simply saying, \u201cWell this is something we\u2019ll talk about\u201d but outright said it would happen.\n\nBecause if she did then she is TA. But if she didn\u2019t then this situation is way more complicated than it appears.", "Wow, that's heartbreaking.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. He needs therapy for sure and possibly a divorce", "NTA - You are a great sister , your brother needs therapy to deal better with the lost", "Yeah soft YTA\n\nI get that you two are very close, and you are very protective after losing your mom, and sister at such a young age, but he has to get out of your house, go home, and deal with this with his wife. \n\nHe's a grown man who ran away from home, because he doesn't want to have to deal with his own problems. What his wife did was really dishonest, and hurtful, and if he really wants another child that badly, then it's time to get a divorce, and find someone else who wants the same thing. \n\nHowever you do not get to unilaterally decide that someone can move into your home. If your wife wants him out, he's out. Period.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nYour brother needs to grow up. I can't even imagine a grown ass man being this broken up over their partner not wanting another kid.

When you live with someone, who can never do that, especially when the person living with you (in this case, your wife) has not been consulted and clearly doesn't want him there.\n2. Your wife sucks for having absolutely no sympathy for your brother and then allowing your SIL in the house to try to bully him back home. That's cruel and horrible to do to someone, irregardless of him being an unwanted houseguest. Her anger should be solely at you, not him.\n3. Your SIL sucks for apparently lying to her husband for five years, for trying to hunt him down when he's trying to process this news, for that sexist \"be a man\" comment (if someone told her to \"be a woman and have another kid\", that person would get destroyed, so why is it OK to say that crap back?), and for failing to get him the help he needed. In that last part, I'd say you suck too.\n4.

And the subject matter you like about is important too. \n\nThat\u2019s wasn\u2019t a white lie. This is, partly, her fault. It makes sense he wants to get away from her for a bit.", "The only issue is the brother saying that SIL admitted to saying it to make him feel better. \n\nWhile he could of been deluded into thinking she agreed to it originally, I just don't see him making up that she said it to make him feel better. If it was based on a mis-hearing due to grief, he would be more likely to be upset that she \"broke her promise\" not that she \"lied to make him feel better.\" \n\nAdditionally, her current completely unempathetic behavior would indicate that he is telling the truth, that she said something just to shit him up and help him cope. Asking him not to bring it up for awhile as well sounds like she was hoping that he would forget about having another child.", "It\u2019s unfair to say he\u2019s making up conversations that never happened. You are saying he\u2019s psychotic and has broken with reality. \n\nHe can be remembering the words perfectly clearly. He may have attached a different significance to them than she intended and that does happen between couples.\n\nNothing indicates bro is psychotic", "He needs to divorce his wife, and find someone who isn\u2019t so comfortable with emotional manipulation.", " As for your wife, she does not sound family oriented. i would kick that woman to the curb for treating my brother that way.", "I genuinely don\u2019t know how to respond to this comment.", "You might want to ask him whether he needs a divorce lawyer. It's not just about the second child. Getting his hopes up like that was disgusting but it seems like this woman doesn't even care about his wellbeing. She didn't let him get grief counseling and she doesn't even care now that he's heartbroken BECAUSE OF HER.", "Info: \n- How do you plan on handling the fact that your wife no longer wants to house your brother? \n- How are you planning on stopping her from inviting SIL in again? \n- Does she feel any remorse for what she did or is she doubling down?", "NTA, but the fact that your wife allowed your SIL in, knowing she\u2019d say something awful to your brother, is concerning. Your SIL is heartless, but your wife doesn\u2019t seem much better. It\u2019s been what? A week? \n\nSIL needs to go, but your wife\u2019s callousness in this situation needs to be addressed, too.", "ah so because he's in crisis he's lying about whether or not he wanted to go to therapy? yikes", "But it\u2019s the brother relaying all this. If his mind latched on to this idea to avoid his grief over his child\u2019s death nothing he says on this topic is reliable because he will have been filtering everything through his denial and avoidance and desperation. It would not even surprise me if he is essentially making up conversations that never happened at this point. I am not saying this to be judgemental of him, it\u2019s out of concern.\n\nAs for her being unempathetic, this is why I think someone needs to talk to her. It is possible she has been dealing with this type of behaviour and his denial for all these years and trying to get him help and she is not coping herself.", "I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s making up conversations. I\u2019m saying that knowing what is going on and to do in this situation is only going to be figured out by accurate information. I\u2019m saying all things should be considered. I\u2019m also not saying he\u2019s psychotic. People\u2019s minds can play tricks on them in trauma and grief that are not psychosis.", "That's not up to just you though. You don't unilaterally get to decide someone can stay in your home. It's also not your call to make as to when he is ready. If you genuinely believe he is a suicide risk, then you need to address that by ensuring he gets therapy. Not hiding him away in your spare bedroom, and completely disrespecting your wife by pretending you're the only one who gets a say as to who can stay in your home.", "Yes, but he isn't the one who ask for it. She denied him therapy and she is the one who used rather than helping him.", "I don't think you're being fair to OP's brother. It wasn't having another child that fixed his depression, it was an element of hope. Hope to be a dad again. To build this future he'd probably always planned in his mind. Hope for happier times. \n\nWhy aren't you turning this ire toward the wife who strung him along for 5 years, allowing those hopes to grow, only to violently dash them when she confessed to lying about wanting it someday too?", "That\u2019s an unnecessarily cruel thing to say", "The comment that she did not want to do therapy together and they could only afford therapy for one, so they prioritized her, tells me that her lack of empathy is long-term. Sure, make her a priority at first, but he lost a child as well. A child he was very close to and as the primary caretaker might have even blamed himself. \n\nI just can't imagine not insisting my partner go to counseling as well, starting when my appointments began to space out. \n\nIF he has been in some type of tale spin or emotional turmoil that has been tail spinning.... why the \"man up\" comments. Why not a phone call to the brother setting up therapy? She knowz they are close. Why didn't she insist on therapy before it got yo this point? She knows he didn't get grief counseling. \n\nIf I read the OP correctly, she didn't even want to listen to his grief, that's why the phone calls were so often at first. \n\nAs close as they are I would think that Op would have also seen signs of him spiraling before this. It doesn't sound like the texts about baby things were often or had increased recently. \n\nNope, those are not the actions of a caring involved spouse. I'm not blaming her. Many relationships do not survive the loss of a child. \n\nIt's very believable that she did not have the emotional energy to handle his grief and chose the easiest route hoping that by the time she had to tell him, NO, he would be past his grief. \n\nI think it's also important to remember that she was grieving too at the time. He is not the only one who lost a child. Her reaction could be due to not fully processing or handling her own grief. I'm not saying she is a bad person, just not capable of empathize with him due to her own grief.", "He\u2019s an adult who needs to get therapy on his own. \n\nAnd yes, he asked for it.", "And doing so is an unnecessarily cruel thing to do to a living being.", "My concern is that this story about therapy is coming from him and either untrue or out of context. It could be that he wanted to avoid therapy for some reason and saying she said \u201cno\u201d is easier than admitting he wouldn\u2019t do it, which would raise questions. \n\nThere is also empathy and compassion fatigue, which are very real problems that occur in situations where someone is dealing with someone else\u2019s long term mental health issues. \n\nI\u2019m not saying any of this to judge him or excuse her but out of concern. From what I am reading this is a situation that is far too serious to simply act based on who \u201cthe bad guy\u201d is. The consequences of not having the right information or the proper story and addressing what is really going on could be dire.", "> My SIL told him herself that it was something that would happen once she was ready. He didn't ask, she told. That was the coping mechanism that got him through Samantha's death, and the fact that he's lost that and his trust in his wife is what he's torn up about.\n\nDo you have more information than Op? \nYes he needs therapy and if his wife was a good partner she would have also try to help him rather than berating him.", "\u201cOnce she\u2019s ready.\u201d That\u2019s never. He tried to ask her again and she said no now he\u2019s throwing a fit.", "She flat out told him she lied. Not that she changed her mind,  that she lied to him for 5 years.", "What a massive double standard you have.", "Your bio is correct"]}
