As a result, my brother(29M), who was 11 at the time, and I became very close. He's my main confidant, and vice versa. He's a very sensitive person, and both of us have always been very family orientated. I like to thank my dad for that.\n\n5 years ago, my niece, Samantha passed away from SIDS at 3 months old. My brother was the SAHP, (as am I). The only thing that seemed to get him through that was his wife, my SIL, and the fact that she promised him that they would try for another child again someday.\n\nI always thought it was a strange promise, but it's my SIL's business, and it became a sort of therapy for him. My SIL asked him not to talk about it, so he would call me. At first, it was almost every day after Samantha passed that one of us would call each other and just talk. For a while, he would often talk about Samantha and I would just console him. Then it slowly turned to talk of the future child. We haven't been talking as much recently, but he still occasionally sends me pictures of baby clothes and Disney movies.\n\nLast Tuesday, he called me, sobbing and begging me to let him stay with me. It turns out, he finally decided to broach the topic of trying for another child with my SIL, and she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\". I went and got him, and he's been staying with me, my wife(31F) and our son(5M) since then.\n\nHe's been basically inconsolable ever since. He's hardly eaten, or gotten out of bed. He stays in the guest room and I take food up to him and get him to eat. It's been fucking awful.\n\nMy wife wants him out, claiming it's \"time he went home\" and my SIL is saying he needs to \"man up\". I think it's unfair to demand I throw my brother out. I'm a SAHD, so it's not as if my wife is the one cleaning up after him, not that there's much to clean up at all. She also claims it's \"bad for our son to have him around like that.\" This is not true. Our son forgot he was here the other day. I told her no. I am not putting him out. He's my damn brother, and with the state he's in, I don't want to lose my other sibling.\n\nShe let my SIL into the house while I was out buying groceries the other day, and it didn't go well. She was heartless, to say the least, demanding he stop moping and leave with her. I told my wife and SIL to please leave him the fuck alone for now and asked my SIL to please leave the house. She left, but not without some choice words. My wife says I'm \"enabling\" my brother. I think he just needs someone to lean on until he's in a frame of mind to care for himself at the least. This is not a permanent situation, by any means.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I fully intend to get him to a therapist as soon as possible. I know this is above my skill set, by far, but right now I'm just doing the best I can until I can make that happen.\n\nEdit 2: I was told it would be good to add the fact that only my SIL got grief counseling after Samantha passed due to them not having the money to, and her wanting to go on her own.

Has he been working? Does he get therapy or any help with grief processing? Or has he been at an emotional standstill for the past 5 years?", "NTA\n\nThere's no time limit on grief. In being told his wife doesn't actually want another child,  your brother has effectively picked up grieving where he left off years ago,  AND is now also grieving the future he thought he'd have,  where he got to be a father.  That's a major loss.  He's mourning the child he already lost,  the child he thought he would still get to have,  and a whole different life he had planned for. \n\nYour wife is being insensitive and his is being cruel.\n\nSide note: telling someone to \"man up\" is infuriating.", "NTA\n\n> she informed him that she never intended to have another, she just wanted him to \"feel better\".\n\nHoly shit\n\nShe lied to him for FIVE YEARS\n\nIt\u2019s okay that she doesn\u2019t want another child. It\u2019s not okay to lie to your partner about this. \n\nI had sympathy for your wife right up until she let SIL in to bully your brother and even joined in. (Look, it sounds like you unilaterally decided on a semi-permanent guest. That\u2019s going to be a problem for some folks, especially with no clear end in sight. And it IS tough to live in a space with someone who is in that kind of depression.)\n\nYour brother isn\u2019t moping, he\u2019s grieving - not just the loss of a potential future, but likely his marriage as well.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think the marriage can survive this. (Nor so I think it should.)", "Your brother needs to get professional help for his grief.", "I\u2019m a mom. Just had my second daughter 3 weeks ago. If one of my kiddos was lost and my man did that crap to me, I\u2019d be single. Stringing someone along like that especially after a loss is often a deal breaker and people telling him to just get over it is pretty fcked up imo. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to stand up for your brother. NTA", "I think you should send your wife to go stay with sister-in-law, and you should help your brother see a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nAs suggested by someone else, your brother should see a professional grief counsellor. There is nothing 'unmanly' about grieving a dead child, but sometimes people need help to get past it.\n\nI would also suggest that if he and his wife have such wildly different visions for the future, they should probably part ways. And if that happens you'll need to support him, because it to me it sounds like he is in an abusive relationship, and it can be hard to leave those.", "Nta...\n\nMy God, those two women are heartless. He's been strung along for years, thinking when the times are right, we'll try, only to be told it's never going to happen.", "NTA it's been just over a week. He needs to process this and figure out what he wants to do. You mention you intend to get him into grief counseling; your wife needs to have patience, because he may come to the conclusion that he can no longer continue to be in a relationship with your SIL. There is no timeline with grief. The pain and loss will remain the same size and intensity as the day it was made; we just grow to accommodate it.", "NTA - this is very sad.", "NTA but your brother needs professional help. Letting him mentally waste away will not help him. He needs grief counseling to help him process the loss of his baby and to help him rebuild his life. He also may need to separate from his wife until he can figure out if he wants to continue with his marriage. \n\nYour wife and sil are being unnecessarily cruel. \n\nPlease get your brother help. He is way past the point of \"not coping\".", "NTA... his wife should of been honest and said no instead of lying.. your wife needs to let him be it's not like she see him or clean up after him... \nMaybe try getting  him into grieve counseling \n.", "NTA- his wife is the a-hole, and so is your wife, to be frank. his wife is as heartless as they come. and she sounds extremely controlling and toxic. he really needs to get out of that marriage, truly. and as for your wife, she does not sound family oriented. i would kick that woman to the curb for treating my brother that way.", "NTA and your wife is really cold. His wife is a monster, as far as I can tell.  Please try to get your brother some help. Hiding in your guest room is not going to be good for him.  Best of luck, that's a really shitty situation.", "NTA... youve already described it perfectly yourself \"heartless\".\n\nYou are being a tremendous brother and he is lucky to have you, professional therapy would be a good thing for him to pursue as well though. Three close family members passing in tragic ways and then his wife and your wife being mixtures of dismissive and cruel towards him. Keep him close and love each other as best as you can.", "Your brother needs therapy ASAP. You need therapy ASAP. \nFocus on that. You two have some serious unresolved trauma, arrested development and PTSD issues to address. This has nothing to do with anyone else.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good brother and I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds horrible. She lied to your brother for years, and when he found out, he was devastated. You are looking out for your brother and giving him time to figure out what to do about his marriage. If your wife cannot be understanding, and is allowing your SIL to confront him, when he's made it clear he doesn't want to talk to her, perhaps your wife should go and live with the SIL for a while.", "NTA. His whole recovery is based on a lie to make him feel better, and now he is being told to 'man up' and it's 'time to get home'. God, I feel so bad for him. \n\nGet him the professional help he needs and get him out of that marriage. She shouldn't have lied about something like that to end up in telling him to \"man up\". She destroyed him.", "NTA. Not only has he lost his child, whom he cared for and spent every day with, but the person who is supposed to be his partner in life has lied to him and belittled his emotions while crushing all hopes he built up for the future.\n\nI'm sure your SIL is grieving in her own way, but this is worrisome behavior, almost like she blames him.\n\nAnd what is wrong with your wife? Unbelievable behavior and completely unsupportive of you when you need to be there for your brother.", "NTA at all. The sil, however, is an AH the size of Jupiter.\n\nMan, you and your bro have been through so much tragedy and pain for being so young. The support system you have with each other is pretty unique and inspiring. That being said, you said yourself that you can't just let him stay in your guest room forever. He should talk with a professional, either 1 on 1 or in a support group. My buddy went through the same devastating misfortune and tried both. He said the support group opened his eyes, and it pretty much saved him. It was a safe space filled with empathy where he could process everything in a healthy way. He's even drinking buddies with a bunch of the guys to this day. Seems like you're his 1 on 1 \"therapist,\" so maybe accompany him to some group sessions to get him out of bed. It can only help. \n\nNow for the other incredibly important issue - the sil. She's as evil as they come. Telling someone to \"man up\" or \"be a man\" is a very toxic thing to say. That's pretty much like saying: be tough and repress your feelings instead of dealing with them. He needs to work through these feelings in a constructive manner, not just bury them and move on.\n\nYou should respect your wife's wishes to help him move forward and out of the house, but definitely NOT into sil's arms. The fact that she admitted she said they'd try for another baby right afterward just to console him, and that she never had any intention of that is fucked up on so many levels. If you send him back to her, she's gonna be spiteful and hurtful and pile on, thus sending your brother down an even darker road than he is on now. All of her actions you've put forth so far are incredibly callous, and what she says is even more nasty and harmful. Your brother is in a very vulnerable place, and you are doing well to protect him. Now help him move forward. Your wife seems supportive as well, but she's probably right when she says he needs to move forward...just not alone with sil.\n\nGood luck with everything, as it's a tough situation with no clear \"right\" answers, but with your help, your bro will recover.", "NTA you are totally in the right to protect and help your brother.", "NTA at all. Everyone grieves in their own way and he needs time to heal. SIL sounds really manipulative and selfish. It's ok for her to not want to go through that again but she shouldn't have given your brother false hope and lied to him for this long. He definitely needs you right now and who knows what this means for his marriage. Only time will tell. He shouldn't be bullied into bottling his feelings either.", "NTA, the wife just ripped threw his healing heart and threw away the pieces! You both need some counseling to see why both your wives don\u2019t seem to have empathy. \n\nYou\u2019re a good brother", "NAH, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything to help your brother in a meaningful way.  He\u2019s been clinging to the idea of another child for five years as a way to avoid dealing with his grief.  Now he\u2019s hiding at your house to continue to avoid dealing with it.  He needs grief counseling.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Do you know for certain that SIL promised him another child outright and then reneged? As in, has she confirmed it or did you witness a conversation? I don\u2019t mean simply saying, \u201cWell this is something we\u2019ll talk about\u201d but outright said it would happen.\n\nBecause if she did then she is TA. But if she didn\u2019t then this situation is way more complicated than it appears.", "Wow, that's heartbreaking.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. He needs therapy for sure and possibly a divorce", "NTA - You are a great sister , your brother needs therapy to deal better with the lost", "Yeah soft YTA\n\nI get that you two are very close, and you are very protective after losing your mom, and sister at such a young age, but he has to get out of your house, go home, and deal with this with his wife. \n\nHe's a grown man who ran away from home, because he doesn't want to have to deal with his own problems. What his wife did was really dishonest, and hurtful, and if he really wants another child that badly, then it's time to get a divorce, and find someone else who wants the same thing. \n\nHowever you do not get to unilaterally decide that someone can move into your home. If your wife wants him out, he's out. Period.", "NTA.", "YTA\n\nYour brother needs to grow up. I can't even imagine a grown ass man being this broken up over their partner not wanting another kid.

When you live with someone, who can never do that, especially when the person living with you (in this case, your wife) has not been consulted and clearly doesn't want him there.\n2. Your wife sucks for having absolutely no sympathy for your brother and then allowing your SIL in the house to try to bully him back home. That's cruel and horrible to do to someone, irregardless of him being an unwanted houseguest. Her anger should be solely at you, not him.\n3. Your SIL sucks for apparently lying to her husband for five years, for trying to hunt him down when he's trying to process this news, for that sexist \"be a man\" comment (if someone told her to \"be a woman and have another kid\", that person would get destroyed, so why is it OK to say that crap back?), and for failing to get him the help he needed. In that last part, I'd say you suck too.\n4.

Right now she\u2019s desperate to have him home; she\u2019s either going to make false promises like I said, or she\u2019s going to continue to call names and try to make him think he\u2019s the bad guy (so he just swallows his pain down and gives her what she wants). \n\n**Now onto your wife, she\u2019s by far the bigger asshole out of her & your SIL. I thought SIL was cruel and heartless, but man she really has her out done**. I honestly don\u2019t get what her damage is, either she really is just a naturally apathetic person or there\u2019s more to the story. The fact she\u2019s not appalled SIL lied tells me she likely knew about it all along. She likely feels sympathy for her and not your brother (which I don\u2019t get they both lost their child), the only thing that makes sense is it\u2019s because she\u2019s a girl; or because she thinks your brother owes it SIL to be miserable for the sake of her being happy. **There\u2019s also the whole other layer of the additional loses you and your brother have lived through. You\u2019re absolutely right that if he just goes home and sucks it up one day you\u2019re going to wake up to a call from the corners office, one person can only lose so many people, and be hurt so much before they just give up. This isn\u2019t some petty \u201cyou forgot to take out the trash\u201d squabble, this is a traumatic issue with zero compromise. At this point op: you have to ask yourself if you\u2019re willing to burn your marriage down to save your brothers life, because that\u2019s likely where you\u2019re at**. \n \n**Your wife\u2019s actions show me that it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or do; there is nothing you can do to convince her, or squeeze even an ounce of empathy for your brother. That\u2019s not something that even if your brother and SIL work it out, you will be able to fix in your own marriage long term. Your marriage is as good as over and much as theirs is**. I also feel the need to tell you that \u201ca broken family\u201d doesn\u2019t hurt the kids so long as you\u2019re present, and they\u2019re still relatively young. By relatively young I mean middle school or younger, and even then if they\u2019re older, it\u2019s still better to see their parents thriving apart than together and resentful. I\u2019m speaking from experience too, my parents are divorced. Not one day of my life did I resent that they weren\u2019t together, or did their divorce hurt me. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known, the only thing that I ever cared about was that they were both always there for me. I\u2019m not saying this to bullshit you or manipulate you either, it\u2019s the gods honest truth. Don\u2019t worry about how you\u2019ll make it outside of being with her either, talk to an attorney you\u2019d be entitled to spousal support during the divorce proceedings before it\u2019s finalized and before you find out if you\u2019re being awarded alimony permanently. \n\n**ETA:** You\u2019d also still have access to you\u2019re shared bank account before then also. The concept is so the insolvent spouse has a way to live, and so both spouses are on equal terms in terms of being able to attorney\u2019s or equal stature. You being a SAHD also heavily goes in your favor, in terms of custody and child support. Don\u2019t be scared of the idea because of how hard it\u2019ll be or how it\u2019ll play out. You\u2019re holding more cards than she is if it came down to a divorce. **If you\u2019re not there yet but feel like you may be, if she doesn\u2019t back down tell her that. Sit her down and lay out your feelings and intentions firmly. Tell her that if it comes down to choosing her or your brother you\u2019ll chose your brother, so she needs to decide if sticking her nose in their marital problems is worth costing her her own marriage**. I still suggest you and your brother see a lawyer though, you don\u2019t have to hire them or sign anything. It would just be a consultation where they\u2019d inform you about the divorce laws specific to your state, and what to expect. You could go and never think or bring it up again, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re filing tomorrow; just that you\u2019re aware of what would happen and what you\u2019d need to do if it came to that.", "Are you sure that your sister-in-law did therapy?

Due to medical issues that arose after we married and had started trying I miscarried 4 times and we decided that we would stop and that was that. After the initial wounds healed I told him that we could discuss adoption but also that I understood that this was not what he had pictured for his life (I have mostly recovered now but I was quite seriously ill still back then and there was no guarantee I would get better). I told him that I wanted him to spend some time and think seriously about the situation and since we were still young enough to start over I wanted him to be honest with himself and decide if life as it had become would be enough for him.

I buy her groceries, I take her abuse while trying to get her to brush her damn teeth, shower, and wash her hair. I force her to put on clean clothes, clean the trash up out of the house, do some laundry, and change the sheets on her bed. Why??? It's not because I like her. It's because despite all her faults, she raised my husband and his siblings, and she is the grandmother to my children. It's because she needs the help at times until she can get a spot in the mental health ward at the hospital (which is usually 6 to 8 weeks wait time in my area unless the person is actively hurting themselves).And even though she wouldn't lift a finger to help me when I had health issues, I will help her again in a couple of years when she spirals again. All because my husband and kids love her. Sometimes, we have to do things we don't want to in order to make sure someone is safe.

Stay strong!", "The only \"manning up\" he should do is man up and consider leaving his wife since they might not have a future together", "He's probably also pretty upset that his wife lied to him about something so important. Personally, I think this is divorce territory for him. It's a little more complicated for OP bc of his son, but it bodes ill that his wife let the SIL in like that. I don't like how she's acting. If I had a partner who treated one of my siblings like that, our relationship would be in *serious* trouble over it.", "I wholeheartedly agree with you! This may sound a bit controvertial, but perhaps, if OP's wife \"womanned up\" and showed him some warmth, kindness and compassion, it would in turn be easier for him to \"man up\", get trough the grieving and be more resilient.", ">Just had my second daughter 3 weeks ago\n\nCongratulations.  Hope you're healing up.", "Absolutely agree. This is horrible. Telling a grieving parent that they can try for another child, and maintaining that (or at least not talking about it and hoping they forget), only to turn round years later and completely dismiss that promise is disgusting and heartless. I couldn't stay with someone that cared so little for me to even think about doing that.", "I like to jump in and agree with this whenever I see it. Please stop telling men to hide their emotions, people. Emotions are natural and valid and not tied to what is in your pants.\n\nMen, your feelings are valid and anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, not you.", "The man has been in bed/seclusion for a week, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see he needs professional help", "Considering she lade that promise at some point I feel like the brother pressed her for an answer way too soon.", "So your brother kept pressuring her for an answer right after they lost their kid, to get a replacement kid, and you somehow don't feel like that is fucked up?", "Maybe she meant it at the time or thought she'd get there. She's the one who went through the pregnancy and delivery to wind up losing the child also. Maybe she lied to herself that she'd get there but realized she doesn't want to go through all of that all over again only to bury another child.\n\nI mean freaking seriously, that's a huge toll on a person- physically, mentally, and spiritually. Dude can divorce her and always have another kid with someone else. She might have PTSD, too afraid to go through that again. He sounds uncaring to what she also went through. You can't just pop another bun in the oven and expect all is going to be all hunky dory.\n\nI couldn't imagine going through pregnancy, birth, and months of motherhood to have the child just spontaneously die.\n\nIf this relationship is going to work, everyone seriously needs some outside help.\n\nEdit for judgment- I don't think anyone can be the AH in this situation. He's grieving and wants another baby. She's grieving and is probably scared of delivering another child that might spontaneously die that she bonded with while carrying them, giving birth to them, and caring for them in hopes they had a long life span and future. It sucks all the way around,", "Yep. Not only lost their daughter AND future child, he's lost his wife too. Whole family gone in the blink of an eye.\n\nHaving watched my dad realise he'd been emotionally abused for the whole 30 years he was married, I see a few parallels. And my dad hasn't lost his 4 kids. But he has lost his family as he knew it, and reframed the entire 30 year marriage. He lost 30 years of love, not just the future relationship.\n\nOP's brother is potentially grieving his whole marriage, past present and future, reframed in that moment right there.", "Fuck we're only allowed to express happiness under specific circumstances and in specific ways.", "You are a wonderful person and sound like an amazing wife. That level of selflessness is very rare in our day and age and I truly and honestly feel like even tho I don't know you 2 of the reasons your husband fell in love with you was because of your kindness and selflessnes. The love for him that you have radiates through this comment. It's beautiful to see because reddit is so full of darkness and horrible stuff all the time.", "Thank you for sharing this. Comments like this are why I'm still on Reddit.", "Maybe they can lie to each other too", "Three funerals, two weddings and a divorce: The rejected first draft for Four weddings and a funeral.", "I was wondering what reasons a parent would choose to go to therapy for the loss of a child without their partner. Cannot understand that logic. It's both of their child, not just the mum's. Why would you refuse your husband that? It's just cruel.\n\nNow you say that, it makes so much more sense. And is so much more cruel...", "He was a stay at home parent.", "What family? His AH wife has just shattered that dream for him. I hope he divorces her and finds someone that shares his values", "I'm a female and my anxiety also presents in anger most of the time & it's exhausting, but like you expressed I can't imagine how even more exhausting it would be being a man & told to man up constantly, etc.", "Hey, nobody is talking about it, but it\u2019s an epidemic. If you want to DM me about it, feel free", "Read OPs comments, he is working", "Oh, boo you suck. That's what a good partner does for you when you are the sahp. Bet you wouldn't have said that if the genders were reversed. You're an asshole, dude.", "My parents went alone, because they found it almost impossible to talk about my brother together until they had been in therapy for a while. \n\nGrief is unpredictable.\n\nBut yeah, she went alone because she wanted to hide that she was lying to him.", "It\u2019s got nothing to do with making up conversations, it just means he could have heard what he wanted to hear", "And some might call it shallow but he has a right to his own priorities and while her decision to not have another child is perfectly valid, he has the right to decide if he wants to remain married knowing that they will never have another child.", "Its not even that, look at the age of the Ops child. The very close brothers would have been raising their children together at the same time at a very similar age. They would have been able to do everything together and things would have been great. Plus the Ops child would be a constant reminder of this fact (not by any fault of anyone), so grieving would be ongoing until a new child came along to help focus the attention.", "You do know she is the one who said we will have another child and then strung him along for 5 years probably already decided that she didn't want another child. If she was honest in the beginning he probably would've grieved accordingly and they may or may not have gotten past the loss of their daughter. And somehow it was convenient for her to go to grief counseling by herself because it wasn't affordable for the both of them. She sounds manipulative and calculating. He already had to deal with losing his mother and sister at a young age. Then when he was blessed with a little girl she also dies. If holding on to a chance of being a father again is bad than every man who has multiple children and loves them are bad. This man went through something traumatic three times, and now he is going through another type of trauma due to a five years long lie told by the woman he thought loved him enough to be honest with him, not coddle him.", "It was all down to him. Honestly I hadn\u2019t had the best relationship experiences and I had turned down proposals before I met him because I wanted more. Most of them treated me as a trophy but when it came down to it they didn\u2019t like that I am very independent and a high earner and there was always jealousy which led to mistrust which led to them trying to control me. When I met him he was just so crazy proud of me and all my achievements and just let me be me. I asked him once if he struggled with jealousy at all because my closest friend is male and I worked in a very male dominated industry (and was a bit of a party animal back in the day!) and he said it didn\u2019t bother him because he knew I was there out of choice. He said he was very aware that if I wanted to walk out the door I was more than capable financially and emotionally so they way he saw it as long as I was with him it was because I wanted to be and on his part he said his job was to never give me a reason to not want to be! I honestly didn\u2019t believe someone like that existed. We made the decision that if we did feel like we had missed out on anything when we got older (maybe in our early 60\u2019s) we would foster children because we thought we would be good at providing a stable and caring environment. Will see how it pans out I guess!", "Tl;dr. Having a baby won\u2019t fix your depression and it\u2019s beyond unfair to put that on an infant. Good night.", "No, read OPs comments. His brother is working.", "My concern here is that his 'fix' for his grief was a replacement child he wanted confirmation on soon after their baby passed. That is just so many levels of wrong.", "Part of finding what's good for us, is the ability to recognize it when it's sitting in front of you, staring you in the face....and the other part is working your ass off to cherish it and stick with it.   \n\n\nThere's something to be said for that, cause if it was a common skill, millions of other people out there, would be leading much better lives.   \n\n\nDon't sell your end of it short. :D  \n\n\nThere are people out there in the world who will murder folks for a cross look or a fucking snickers bar.....imagine what they'd do, for a relationship like what you have or I have.....regardless of the fact that they couldn't recognize it, and don't have the skills to develop or keep it.   \n\n\nIt's something precious, and worth giving everything to/for.", "No one is suggesting to have a baby to cure depression here but you, dude. You've got a real bee in your bonnet over a scenario entirely in your head. Take a breath, touch grass.", "The OP has already explained this - even after his brother got a job they couldn't afford it because SIL took the opportunity to slash her hours so they only had the same income as before."]}
