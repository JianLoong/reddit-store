You need to talk to your son, have a real conversation, and be transparent.  You don't want the uncle to seem like this completely attractive alternative.", "light YTA just because I know he\u2019s not going to trust you at all now for going behind his back like that, did you really take his phone and xbox because of what his uncle said and not anything your kid did himself? I get being super worried about his uncles influence but the kid shouldn\u2019t be punished for that.", "Soft YTA. You aren't an AH for being mad about this specific situation and you aren't an AH for being mad at your stepbrother for telling the kids they're adopted. But I don't get it. You won't allow contact with the stepbrother at all because he called your abusive ex abusive, but you will allow the kids to form their own relationships and opinions about said abuser?\n\nIt sounds like the stepbrother is honest with your kids and your son appreciates that and trusts him. I feel like the same logic should apply to him that it does to their bio dad, ESPECIALLY since he is not abusive to them.", "Partly YTA - You want your kids to make a decision themselves about their bio-dad, but not with their uncle? And to punish your kid for simply talking to someone that he has no issue with is pretty shitty imo. \n\nYour son also simply said, \"That's not gonna happen,\" so why are you punishing him when you and your step-bro are the ones with the relationship issue.\n\nAll in all, you broke trust, and that'll be so difficult to get back. This is what brings kids to be sneaky and not come to you about things. Just rethink your actions and understand that just because you don't like someone doesn't mean your kid has to not like them, too.\n\nFrom what you've said, the uncle doesn't seem to bring harm to the kids. So I feel there is no reason to do what you did.", "YTA because you punished your son for his uncle's behavior after breaking his trust. You should explain to your son why you don't want him talking to his uncle. To your son this probably seemed okay, he wasn't talking to strangers or watching porn or anything. And your stepbrother is the one who insulted you. Your son just said you wouldn't let him go to the range with his uncle, which seems to be true.", "I'm 50/50 because all that is going to happen is he will learn to be sneaky. Instead, you should talk to him about why you don't have anything to do with his uncle", "YTA congrats your kid will never talk to you again", "NTA. Any caring parent would make sure that there child is not being exposed or exploited by anything on the internet or by any other means. I do want to ask, how sis your son feel about this situation? Did you speak with him and calmly explain why you felt the need to take his devices? Did you explain to him why your stepbrother crossed important boundaries or did you just act from anger leaving him feeling betrayed?\n\nI find what you do is not always as important as how you do things. If you haven\u2019t had a calm and meaningful conversation with your son please do it right away because you don\u2019t want your son pursuing the \u201cforbidden\u201d relationship with your stepbrother in defiance and to spite you!", "This is a nuanced incident. You aren\u2019t an AH for being a mum but you are for taking advantage of an opportunity to violate your son\u2019s privacy. The greater good cancels out the offence - so you are back to NTA but it doesn\u2019t fix the broken trust.", "YTA. You shouldn't have looked AND you overreacted. Nothing bad was said in that text exchange.", "YTA for violating his trust.", "YTA. Why did you punish your son for something his uncle said?? He may not have before, but he probably thinks you\u2019re a trashcan emoji now", "Nta you\u2019re the parents and you\u2019re paying for the devices are you not?", "NTA fuck your stepbrother that'd not just place at all.   \n\nAs gar ad your kid if ther under 18 and your paying the bill do whatever the he'll u want", "NTA When my kids are old enough to have a phone it will be with the understanding that I'll be looking at it. The uncle should absolutely not be talking with your son, he sounds toxic AF. Did the uncle reach out to him or was it your son that did? Does your son know how you feel about the uncle? I would have a conversation with your son, not just lock up the phone and xbox.", "Your teen is a teenager so is kinda rite of passage to be rebellious but the uncle is an adult, if he can't respect the boundaries or even stop trash talking the parents he should be block.", "NTA for looking at his phone, but you are an AH for giving him a phone and telling him it his. Instead, buy a phone that belongs to you and allow your child to use it. Explain that while they get to use it, it is your phone, not theirs, which means you get to access it, take it away, set rules for when and how it is used. Then you don't have to worry about violating his privacy because there is no expectation of privacy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're not old enough to make their own decisions. You're being a parent by knowing what's going on in their lives, which not enough parents do these days.\n\nHe can have privacy when he's 18.", "light YTA because it is an invasion of privacy. And you should definitely tell him you did it.\n\nBut this is really disturbing stuff.\n\nWhen you give kids devices or access to internet/online tools you should always say up front that until they're X age, you may have to check in on how they're using them sometimes, for their own safety.", "OP really needs to have that conversation with her son. She risks turning uncle into Forbidden Fruit. I teach middle schoolers and I\u2019ve seen kids latch on to adults who don\u2019t have their best interests in mind because when you\u2019re that age and someone who isn\u2019t your parent is letting you go against the rules it feels pretty awesome. \n\nMy other concern is that uncle is using the son to get to her. Perhaps he needs more time with his dad where he can explore his interests together.", "I mean, aside from uncle telling a 13 year old that his mother is trash, sure...", "This exactly this atm all he sees is his cool uncle wants to take him shooting but strict mum won't let them", "I don\u2019t think kids should be involved in adult drama. That should be a whole separate world from them. YTA for punishing your son and this just feels like an overreaction. Overreactions like this lead to a lot of mistrust that can lead to safety concerns.", "YTA. kids pick up on more than you think and they're teenagers not idiots. it's not a big deal to tell your kids that they're dad is really their stepdad bc their real dad was a bad guy. would they ask questions? yes. the question is were you ready to answer them and if that's the case that's not your brothers fault you've been living in delulu land like nothing ever happened. omitting the truth is the same as lying. probably why your son feels more comfortable talking to his uncle than you bc his uncle doesn't sugar coat anything. not only did you go through his phone but you blocked the only sources of communication w his uncle bc of your disdain for him telling your kids the truth. i guarantee they had already picked up on the fact that something was a little off but didn't say anything. and then instead of sitting down w your kids after it was revealed you continued to try to cover it up by cutting off contact. you jumping through hoops to keep secrets instead of just being honest w your kids especially now that they're older makes YTA.", "Unless you have a serious and immediate concern, you should not be rooting through your child's texts without telling him first that you're going to do it - and, honestly, being clear from the start that his phone is not private. It's like reading his diary. It is, in fact, a betrayal of his trust and privacy. \n\nHowever, what his uncle has said over the years is beyond the pale. Not cool. So ESH except your kids.\n\nAdditionally... was your original plan to not even tell the kids they were adopted until they were in their teens? That's not okay. Nobody who works with adoption would recommend this. \n\nAnd then, what's up with this?\n\n> At one point they discussed firearms, which is not exactly an issue but it\u2019s a dad thing to discuss first. \n\nWhy is this \"a dad thing to discuss first\"? Exactly how many topics do you have that only certain people are allowed to talk to your kids about, and have you explicitly informed all the various adults in the family about these rules?", "Yta. Not telling a kid they are adopted is one of the worst things you can do. Your kids may be minors, but you don't own them and you don't get to withhold such info. Your step brother shouldn't have been trash talking you, but given your extreme lack of judgment, his description of you is accurate. Unless your 13yo would be put in danger by your\nStep brother, they should still be aloud to have a relationship", "YTA, taking away all of his electronics because he's having contact with a relative you don't want him to have contact with his unfair. The bad action is on the part of the relative, not him. This isn't going to keep him away from your step brother, it's not going to promote understanding about safer unsafe conversations, it's only going to build resentment.", "ETA. I might not agree with taking all the electronics away. But I'm going NTA to go through the actual phone. When we gave our kids phones, we were very upfront about this being our phone, that we pay for, and we let them use. I have gone through my son's phone twice, but I've let them know after the fact. He was showing signs of being bullied and I basically had it confirmed.", "NTA", "Snooping through his phone, locking that and the Xbox away, and getting mad at him because of his uncle and she somehow isn't an AH??\n\nShe's an adult. If she can't talk to her kids to teach them a life lesson, she is a major AH. It's not even like this is her first time reading his phone.\n\nYTA", "He ll never trust her again .\n\n She broke and read his private messages without any reason to do so other than curiosity \n\nand she punished him for something someone ELSE SAID.\n\n\n YTA and a huge one op", "But the kid is innocent. \n\nHe didn't say anything about his mother other than being aware to that she won't let him go to a fire range.\n\nHe did absolutely  nothing wrong and was talking to his uncle ffs.", "And with something like shooting, there\u2019s the danger element. Is uncle responsible with weapons or is he lax? I\u2019d be worried the son would say he\u2019s going to his friend\u2019s house but go shooting with uncle instead and something bad happens. \n\nI really think she should consider having dad take him to a range (preferably one with instructors onsite)."]}
