They had just graduated HS during the height of Covid and a lot of the traditional senior experience was robbed from them, so to speak. In 2022, my finances took a nosedive. I couldn\u2019t afford to repeat the previous year gifts, whether as physical presents that matched the price tag or as monetary value. Instead, I purchased them each a gift that was cheaper, but meaningful & pertained to their interests. They seemed grateful, but I could tell Rob really preferred the year before money.

I\u2019d not be gifting him anything in the future, maybe he\u2019ll someday learn not to be such a jerk.", "NTA. Rob is stupid but you should give him the money instead otherwise this is going to become some big stupid thing you\u2019d have to deal with.", "NTA, for sure, but I think you need to simplify your narrative for yourself a bit, to know what you should do.\n\n1. Basically, I think what ticked you off, understandably, was Rob's pre-gift \"rudeness\" (\"practicing a religion that doesn't accepts gifts\"? Really??) and presumption, considering that you had a good intent and were gonna give him $$.\n2. I think you'd have been fine with him going back on his story if he was honest, but him making up \"new conditions\" was in-part not credulous and in-part made you feel that you a fool.\n3. You called him out on it, and he stood his ground (which is silly, entitled, and sounds like a 22 year old).\n4. His \"explosion\" turned you off even more, understandably.\n\nI'd say, figure out what you want out of this: You could let it go, or hold it against him, or make it a teaching/learning moment. If you're still going to give him gifts (which I would reconsider, but that's just me), then what point does withholding this gift make? It won't change his habits. If you don't want him behaving this way then, I'd probably sit him down in front of the family and have an adult-chat with him: Tell him what you told us here and show him that you intended to give him the present. Tell him straight-up that you didn't believe the religion thing (and that you could be wrong, but you didn't believe him -- which cuts through the \"proof\" nonsense), and ask him to come clean and that you wouldn't judge him for it.\n\nYou could (I certainly would ) also confront the prev. gift's disappointment but tell him *that you were too* (gets common ground, so he's likely to be a rebellious idiot)*,* but that's really no reason for him to act the way he did. You give them presents because you like them, and if you don't like him for the way he's acting then why would you do that? I think you can make him understand that (1) he's not entitled, and (2) There's no point in acting childishly.\n\nIf he comes clean and apologizes (ask him if actually means it), give him the present. And if he doesn't and until he does, either withold it, or double Peyton's presents (showing that you have the intent to give presents, and since you can't give it him, someone who's nicer gets to benefit more). Or potentially, you could save that money and put it elsewhere for him (or his wedding, or his kid) for future so that way he doesn't \"lose out\" on the presents, but just doesn't get them until he changes his ways. **Most of all, let the kid decide: does he want to get what he wants by trickery/deceit or by being genuinely nice and changing his ways?** Don't push him; don't make deals; don't chastize, and let him learn :) That way you (and his family) get a present of your own :D\n\nPS. Look into the religion to see what this \"no-gift\" nonsense is. If I'm not wrong, religions do have this clause (Islam and Christianity do, I think), but that's more not-accepting-them from people who are believed to *immoral, or who somehow got the gift immorally*. So, that way if he's BSing you (which, I think he is too), you'd know (don't argue about it with him though, cz these arguments get nowhere), and you can tell him that he's not being considerate or respectful (literally meaning \"re\"-\"spect\", i.e. to look at  something again).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
