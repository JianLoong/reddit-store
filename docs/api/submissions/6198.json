She didn't end up getting the job, but Kate did and she was very upset. She's moved on and got offers from a couple of other places.\n\nWe had a \"friends\" Christmas a couple of days after actual Christmas, where some of my college buddies and their families got together. The conversation turned to Tom and his wife and they were talking about Kate's new job. I saw Anne and Kate talking and we congratulated her.\n\nWe all came back home (Anne left her car at our place and went back to her apartment after). She started saying she has to work so hard to get what Kate gets \"handed to her\". I said this is a competitive field and Anne should be more diligent. She blew up at me and my wife, that we're \"egging Kate and Tom on\", and apparently Kate told Anne she could help her out.\n\nI eventually told Anne she needs to stop sulking over Kate, yes maybe Kate had an edge at the firm, but from what I've heard from Tom she always works on herself and is getting better, and Anne could learn something.\n\nWell Anne got pretty angry after that. Both me and my wife called her but she didn't answer.\n\nI don't think what I said was wrong, but my younger daughter thinks otherwise and said I should post on here.", "created_utc": 1672584702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100l6ub/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_could_learn/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His niece just happened to be the best candidate for the firm? Come on.\n\nI'm sure there are things Anne could improve but there's no lesson here except that life is unfair and a niece matters more than a best friend's daughter. And if Kate is so great how come she had to take a job at the family company? That's often a sign you couldn't make it on your own. You've completely misinterpreted the situation and insulted your daughter for no reason.", "YTA.\n\n*Of course* this is an unfair competition when she\u2018s related to one of the co-owners! You\u2018re being truly awful to your daughter.", "YTA\n\nSmells like someone has been reading up on nepo babies a lot.", "YTA. LOL, you really think Kate got the job on merit.  That\u2019s precious.  She was always going to get the job at the firm owned by her uncle. Don\u2019t be so naive. The job was handed to her.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter is doing well.  She did well in school and got several job offers. What is she supposed to work on? Getting a family member to own a an architecture firm so they can give her a job?", "YTA.\n\nYou have a successful child who is upset about blatant nepotism and you decided to use this opportunity as a reason to criticize her for being lazy and not diligent enough.", "YTA Jesus just disown your daughter and adopt Kate already. You treated your daughter terribly. Parents are supposed to be cheerleaders, not the harshest critic. Kate has a blatant advantage courtesy of nepotism but sure your daughters to one who didn\u2019t try hard enough and \u201clazed about\u201d.", "YTA\n\nYeah, Anne could apply to her uncle's firm for a job. In this situation your advice was pointless, Anne was never going to get that job over Kate. \n\nAnne doesn't want to talk to you because you seem to be putting her down a lot and she doesn't want that in her life.", "YTA, ofc Kate has been accepted: she is the co-owner's niece.It is normal for your daughter to be upset especially after you put her down , which you seem to be doing often since the second conversation while praising Kate.", "YTA\n\nShame you can't bring yourself to even pretend you like or are proud of your daughter.", "So Kate got a job at a firm that is co-owned by her uncle, and even if Kate is as great as you said, I'm sure some form of nepotism popped up and helped her cinch the job, or course your daughter is a bit bitter about it, but instead of being supportive of your daughter, your being supportive of your friend's kid... Who is more important to you? Because from what you wrote, you sound like you prefer Kate over your daughter, and it's no wonder your daughter isn't talking to you. Even if you think your daughter could have done better, sometimes you need to shut your mouth and support your kid.\n\nYTA, and you should listen to your younger daughter.", "YTA.  Your post made it clear from the very start that you don't think your own daughter is as good as Kate. But I'll tell you a little secret - you don't know that.\n\nYou said yourself that WHAT YOU HEAR FROM TOM is that she works hard on herself. Because unlike YOU,  Tom is a supportive dad who lifts up his daughter, instead of shit-talking her.\n\nOne of you could CERTAINLY learn something from their dynamic.... and it's not Anna.", "YTA. You honestly think Kate's position has nothing to do with nepotism? And furthermore, how could you compare your daughter to someone else and NOT see how you're ta? You're supposed to be her biggest supporter, not put her down when she's feeling low about herself.", "YTA.  OMG, of course relatives get a leg up.", "Hey OP Kate didn\u2019t get the job because she was more qualified, she got it because of nepotism lol", "Maybe not necessarily nepotism, maybe Kate IS actually very capable but putting your own daughter down like that and comparing her to Kate is absolutely an AH move.", "YTA and I\u2019m not even sure what you think you\u2019re trying to accomplish. Your daughter has multiple job offers. She\u2019s doing well too. What is it that you think she could learn from Kate? To be more outgoing? It sounds like you just don\u2019t like your daughter\u2019s personality. Your comment was cruel.", "YTA.\n\nYour friend got his daughter a job at his brother's company and then you blamed your daughter's shortfall to get a job on*her* despite the fact that she was out done by someone who didn't earn the position based on merit. That is galling and your feedback was in no way constructive. Now her friend is offering her charity by getting her job she will have not earned on merit. \n\nThis is going to lead to more than hard feelings. You've insulted her professional identity and vague \"just network\" advice is the most insulting feedback young people get. You might as well have told her to be related to someone who wasn't completely worthless.", "YTA\n\nHow about cheering your daughter on instead of putting her down? Of course Kate got the job because it's her uncle's company! Ever year of nepotism? Clearly a case of that with Kate, Anne never stood a chance getting that job.", "YTA, your daughter has every right to be upset especially since its more than likely Kate got the job because her uncle owns the firm. We all know that it doesn\u2019t matter what your resume looks like or where you went to school, it\u2019s about who you know. The uncle probably would\u2019ve never heard the end of it if he hired your daughter over his own niece. \n\nWhile what you said to her wasn\u2019t completely wrong you did leave out the fact that Kate was handed the job. Acknowledge that fact and then tell your daughter. And let her cool off too. She\u2019ll come to you when she\u2019s ready to talk.", "You really needed it spelled out here for you? NEPOTISM don't be clueless.....if the great great granddaughter of frank lloyd wright and Tom's niece was up for the position Kate would have still gotten it.", "YTA. My mom also celebrated her friends kids wins more then mine, and rubbed them in my face. I no longer speak to her. Obviously your friends daughter had a step up being family with the owner, to say that she worked harder is such an insult. Also I imagine Kate and Anne are very similar, except that her dad praises her in public and you tell your daughter that she could learn from them. \"Look this is what supportive parents look like, you could learn from that\" lmao what a weirdo.", "YTA - attempting to manipulate your kid into some thing you think you see is terrible parenting. Her friends uncle is part owner. Clearly that's a factor here so let her have her negative feelings about it. You could have stepped in and ACTUALLY helped by saying her feelings are natural but also this is just part of life and she's doing fine etc. Instead you did the narc thing of putting the other girl on a pedestal and pulling the \"Why don't you be more like her\" crap. FYI I was raised by parents that did nothing but that so I'm kind of an expert here; it doesn't yield good results", "YTA\nWhy are believing their world view over your daughter's ?!", "YTA and a bad parent", "Yta \n\nHave you heard of the word nepotism?", "YTA.  You blew the opportunity to lift your own daughter up but hey I bet Kate is feeling just wonderful.", "YTA. Yeah maybe I kinda understand that you were irritated by your your daughter's crack  about it being nepotism (though as an architect who has been in the field for 40 years and owned my own firm for 30 of them my guess is nepotism) but your response was a really nasty dig that really hurt her.  I don't blame her for needing some time to cool off. You need to apologize now.", "YTA. Kate was handed her job on a plate. It's called nepotism. Your daughter has had offers purely on her own merits and you still think Kate is somehow doing better than her? What is wrong with you?", "Anne went to MIT, one of the best school in the world and you call her lazy???\n\nWow YTA a million times over", "YTA", "YTA and it\u2019s sad that you have to ask. I\u2019m not saying Kate solely got the job because it\u2019s her Uncle\u2019s firm but her being qualified meant she was most likely getting that job over anyone else. Also most people generally only share the positives about how their children are doing in their careers and college. Most aren\u2019t going to say their child is \u201clazy\u201d", "Yta, if her uncle didn't own the company then do you honestly believe that she'd still get the job? Be real", "YTA. Nepotism is a thing and will always be a thing. Kate just needs to be a mediocre architect to be hired since it\u2019s her uncle\u2019s firm, while Anne needs to be a good one to get a job. I\u2019m not saying that it is the case here, it is simple a fact that Kate always has more opportunities.", "YTA, stop judging your daughter and start helping her", "You messed up comparing your daughter to Kate and telling her how she should be more like her.  Ummm, did u seriously think that would go over well.....?\n\nYta", "Your daughter can definitely do better! Get a new family with connections for example so that she can also benefit from nepotism! YTA", "Yeah my lazy daughter got into MIT and worked her ass off just so I can call her lazy and say my buddys daughter is better. Yeah your the asshole man", "YTA. She isn\u2019t wrong about why Kate got the job. Rather than tearing her down why don\u2019t you try building her up? Oh, and saying she\u2019s lazy is judgmental. I hope you don\u2019t use those words with her but Im betting you do. A critical parent scars a kid.", "So let's see if we can play a little game. We have 2 young candidates for a job. They are the same age, have the same skill set, comparative grades, the only differences one possible employee is related to the owner of the company and the other is not . I wonder who's going to get that job.", "\"yes, maybe Kate had an edge.\" No maybe about it. In this scenario, Anne has no way of \"learning something\" other than perhaps learning nepotism.  The only thing you have taught her here is that she should have been born into a better family. \nYTA.", "If I were Anne I would be complaining about how useless my parents are compared to Kate's parents. Kate's parents helped her land a job, what have you done for her? You should be more like Kate's dad.", "YTA.  Not only was it mean but I am willing to bet you have said things to her before that compared her to others and hurt her feelings.  How about I tell you that Tom is a better father than you because his daughter has the self esteem to put herself out there while your child \u201clazes about\u201d doubting herself because you and your wife don\u2019t find her as great as Kate.  Don\u2019t worry, if you are a better parent than I think you are, she will come back, she just needs time to heal from the wounds you inflicted before she comes back for more.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter went to one of the best schools in America (MIT), she has had multiple job offers and Anne can't rely on her uncle hiring her. Every thing Anne gets is based purely on Merit, while Kate relies on family to give her a job.\n\nKatie's father was justifying why his daughter got the job 'with the: she also works hard' comment and you just sucked it up. Just because Kate is an extravert doesn't mean she actually has the skill to back it up. It's just the world favours extraverts instead of introverts.\n\nDid Kate actually go to the same school? Or did she not go to as good as school as Anne and you are playing it down to make Anne look worse?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a field with a very high amount of nepotism.

Come one be a better parent and actually listen and comfort your daughter.", "YTA your daughter didn't stand a chance getting hired there even if she had a 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, and shit gold. The owner was going to hire family. Kate DID have this job handed to her.\n\nYou are truly awful to had said what you did. Your daughter could have got the job if it wasn't for nepotism. Of course Tom and brother is going to talk up Kate.... she is family! Maybe you should learn from them and talk up your own daughter.", "Buddy, there was no way anyone but Kate was getting that job. Anne is right.", "YTA are you serious it was nepotism", "YTA. the only thing anne can learn from kate is nepotism works. kate got the job because of her uncle, not because anne needs to brush up on anything. it sucks that they applied for the same job and (i'd bet money) they didn't consider each of them on merit and just gave it to kate because family. you said yourself that anne did well, has offers so what's your problem? just because she spends her spare time relaxing doesn't make her lazy, and obviously if she's doing well in a competitive boys club field then she's definitely not that. you owe her an apology.", "YTA! why arent you hiring her at your firm so she too can be a nepo baby? Oh you dont have one? you should keep quiet.", "YTA.   Kate got hired because she's a close relative not because she's somehow better than Anne.

To have more well-connected parents?\n\nYTA", "She decided to be more like Kate and come from a different family disowning you. Since Kate is only in her position from her family.

Are you going to start an architecture firm and hire her? \n\nIt would be one thing if you suggested that she should keep Kate and her family in mind for networking purposes, but it sounds like Kate got hired because of nepotism, not actually being better qualified for the job. YTA", ">I was trying to tell her where to improve, but I get how it could've come across harshly.\n\nThis exact sentence here is the reason I almost went LC/NC with my own mother. Never any praise, always an \"improvement.\" If myself or my brother got a B in a test, there was barely ever anything positive to say - it was always \"Well maybe if you did this, you'd have gotten an A\" \"Why didn't you get an A?\" \"OK but let's aim for the A next time.\" It causes my brother and I to stop putting effort into a lot of things we  did because we knew we'd get negativity/told off regardless of the result. And obviously that's drastically affected our lives and what direction they went in.\n\nMy mother never realised she was speaking like this. She thought she was giving us praise but then always adding a next time goal to try and help us improve. It took both my brother and I sitting her down together when we were both in our early 20s and telling her she needed to stop or we'd start cutting contact because we couldn't take it any more. The fact that my brother and I were united on something was shocking to my mother because we hate each other and she will openly admit that it was the reason she decided that something had to be done because we would never agree on something unless it was serious.\n\nShe went to therapy, had a single session, came back that night and apologised for the years of negativity. I don't know what happened in that single therapy session but she became a new person and has been so much better to us both. I wish I could meet that therapist just to thank her.\n\nMaybe it's something you need to try yourself before you lose Anne.", ">And by lazed I mean that Anne generally doesn't reach out first or go look for job opportunities, applications that much. \n\nDid you not say she got a couple more offers?  Did they just magically appear?   And how could she possibly have had enough prior knowledge to apply \"first\" for a position in Kate's uncle's firm\n\n> I was trying to tell her where to improve,\n\nImprove what?  You said that Anne got offers from a couple of other places so she must be something right.  \n\nThe takeaway from your post is that you just don't like your daughter as much as you like your friend's daughter and wish she were a different person with a different personality.   That's a heavy burden for any child to live with.", "Only you said in the psot that she had reached out and gotten other offers from other places.... \n\nSo your high achieving kid who graduated from a prestigious school supposedly is 'lazy' because she only got job offers from places where family doesn't work.... Like what? \n\nIf you want her to improve the way that Kate has why aren't you offering Anne a job at your architecture firm?", "INFO: \n\nOP I observed that you told us what school Kate went to for architecture (I assume a good school) but you didn\u2019t tell us where Anne went? Just that \u201cshe went into architecture\u201d too. Did you pay for Anne to attend a school equal to Kate\u2019s in prestige?", "Perhaps Kate\u2019s parents could adopt Anne. That would be an improvement and help her get a job. You\u2019re a judgmental parent and that\u2019s awful.", ">\tI was trying to tell her where to improve,\n\nNope, you were being a dick.  You still don\u2019t get it, do you? Why did Anne not get the job?  Could it be due to Kate being related to the company owners? \n\nSo, instead of putting your daughter down, you could actually have been a cheerleader and supported her.  How could Anne have improved? By marrying the owner of the firm? By shagging the owner of the firm? How? Anne sure as heck cannot become the daughter of the owner, so how?", "Yes but you\u2019re comparing her unfavorably to someone who has what was probably  insurmountable edge over her in that particular scenario. If you feel she doesn\u2019t take initiative or is \u201clazy\u201d, you could point out these issues and encourage her to make improvements without comparing her to anyone else. Since you didn\u2019t do that, YTA.", "What a jerk of a father", "Your daughter went to an excellent college, got a job (presumably not offered to her by someone she is *related to*), and is only 22 years old.  Don't offer unsolicited advice when she is still smarting from not getting a job she wanted because she doesn't have the same DNA as the owner of the firm.  There is *nothing* she could have done to have gotten that job over Kate.  No amount of being an outgoing go-getter was going to change that.  It's unfair, but it's life, and she is allowed to not be thrilled about it.  She's absorbing that disappointment.  And you are being an asshole and pointing out what you view are her faults is just tone deaf and rotten.  Go ahead and dig your heels in some more and then wonder why she still won't answer your calls.  You can decide to learn from this, or you can decide you are right.

Confirm that yes, nepotism sucks, but she still did well for herself and got good offers on her merit? But no.

But tbh, sometimes people want to vent and have an ear rather than advice. I think that\u2019s where ya flubbed up.", "Kate\u2019s merits are basically irrelevant when her uncle is the one who is doing the hiring. I\u2019m sure your daughter works just as hard but you are putting her down because she is frustrated about nepotism.
