So I did some digging and found the iPad in her bag, it had been factory reset and the case was gone so I have a feeling she was going to sell it? It was possible my brother put it there but considering she uses the bag multiple times a day she should have known it was there either way. I looked into things some more but couldn\u2019t find anything so I just told myself my brother put it there for whatever reason and lied, and my mom\u2026 somehow missed it. 7yo do dumb things, right? \n\nI did tell her I found it. i got in trouble for snooping through her things and no apology because \u201cwhat you said to me was completely out of line\u201d. As for the iPad itself she\u2019s convinced I had it and put it in her bag to get myself out of trouble. She never did call the cops though\u2014 so that\u2019s a plus? I\u2019m starting to doubt my brother had any involvement , especially with the ipad being reset. I\u2019ll have to do some more investigating but either my mom plans to sell it (she still hasn\u2019t given it back to my brother) or she really does think it\u2019s me and my stepdad was behind it. Again there is the possibility I mentioned earlier of my brother doing it but that could be denial speaking, I\u2019m pretty upset at the idea she\u2019d punish me for something she was behind the whole time \n\nI\u2019m pretty tired as of the time I\u2019m writing this so if I forgot to answer one of your questions or something is unclear I do apologize and please tell me!", "created_utc": 1673571846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10agntw/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_hope_the_police/", "score": 1146, "replies": ["Jesus OP...\n\nI'm sorry and I hope you can get out soon. From your update she blames the Stepdad too? How is he handling all of this, can you get him on your side?", "Man , if I were you I'd go about my everyday life trying to avoid her at all costs \ud83d\ude02 \nI hope you get out soon .", "Your mother is an awful person to live with.  You already suspect mental health issues and you are probably very right.  With no insight, she will never seek help.  Your stepfather is her enabler.  It's either easier to let her get away with it to make his life easier.  \n\nYou are currently the scapegoat, of course your step father will take her side otherwise she will turn on him.\n\nHe may also be worried that if he doesn't, that she will take his children and not him see them.  Or lie about what he does.\n\nIt's a shame you are only 14 as there are still a few more years before you can move out.\n\nHave secret bank account that your mother doesn't know about and don't tell her what you will be earning.  I expect she will want you to pay board or for things that she doesn't want to pay for... like food.\n\nYou are not responsible for your siblings so don't take them on board.  If there is no food in the house (with you expected to pay), anonymously call CPS and let them know there is no food in the house and your mother won't get any.  They will come and look.  And deny all knowledge that it's you reporting her.\n\nThe rest of your mothers family also enable her.  They may be just like her and it's where she learnt her behaviour from.\n\nTalk to your most trusted teacher and they may have some suggestions.  They also might not but at least it's someone to talk to... or the school guidance officer.\n\nYour mother would rather throw you under a bus to protect herself.  I don't doubt she wanted to sell the ipad because she needed money.", "OP I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. She\u2019s either doing this deliberately which is AWFUL and honestly unhinged, or she did it, suffered some type of mental break and is delusional to the point she\u2019s forgotten. Either way this sucks. Is there anyone else you can live with?? \n\nStories like this make me want to open my home to foster kids. I hate this for you", "Are you sure she doesn\u2019t have a mental illness like schizophrenia where delusions and blackout moments in their memory is possible? I mean clearly she has mental health issues and needs therapy. \n\nI think you\u2019re right that\u2019s it\u2019s highly unlikely that the 7 year old was involved with this. First it was his iPad if I recall correctly. He would want it back. He would not keep up this charade for days. Second, he would not have wiped the thing to factory reset. Especially if there were parental controls on it. So that leaves your mother or step dad. Seeing it was in your mom\u2019s bag AND that she hasn\u2019t given it back to your brother seems like the suspicion lays more on her than anyone else. Had it been your stepdad hiding it and resetting it, she would have already been relieved to have it back and given it back to your brother. It makes no sense for her to keep it if she didn\u2019t take it to begin with. \n\nI\u2019ll also continue to speculate that she intentionally took it to sell it and wanted to blame you for it so she didn\u2019t look like the AH. It\u2019s easier to set you up for the fall.  \n\nRegardless, your mom is seriously messed up. What she\u2019s doing is abuse. It\u2019s emotional abuse, psychological abuse and verbal abuse. While it isn\u2019t physical abuse or neglect or child endangerment per say, it definitively is domestic abuse.", "Yeah there's zero chance your brother had anything to do with this.\n\nShe's either trying to make a few bucks and making things up to deflect any blame or just straight up manufacturing excuses to be angry with you.\n\nOr both. She sounds nuts.", "Ya, your mom took it and blamed you. You are not crazy. Write this shit down so she doesn\u2019t gaslight you into staying or believing her.", "Your 7YO brother didn't factory reset an I-Pad and hide it in his Mom's bag. That didn't happen.  \n\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you.", "I read your original post. I thought then that the mom was going to sell and pin it on you. I'm sorry my suspicions were correct. I really don't think your brother would do that, it makes no sense", "OP\n\nDude ur mom is toxic and your fam is useless. \nYou need to make plans to leave ASAP. Thisay not seem as bad as things could be but this is how it starts and escalates from here. \n\nSorry cps failed you. They failed me too. Plenty of PTSD\n\nGet yourself a bank account without your mom's name on it. Until you're 18 you'll need a fam or friend you can trust.\nAlso get a PO box for your mail. It's highly important you do this!\nGet a job and save as much as possible. \n\nDO NOT TELL HER OR ANYONE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE OR ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT AND POBOX. \n\nWhen you get a car, NOBODY'S NAME ON THE TITLE EXCEPT YOURS!", "Look into emancipation laws in your area. It most likely will not help until you are 16, but at least it's earlier than 18.", "Please stop trying to justify your mom\u2019s behavior by doubting yourself. I do that all the time at work to placate people even though I know I\u2019m right. Sometimes it\u2019s just easier to do that so I get it. But always TRUST YOUR GUT. Do not let anyone make you doubt yourself. From what I\u2019ve read, you sound very smart and intuitive. Your mom sees that as a threat because she is immature and insecure. Her behavior is a reflection of HER and never a reflection of you. Stay strong!", "Excellent advice", "OP i\u2019m so sorry your mom still brings up you throwing out an ipad when you were 5. As someone that works with kids, your reaction to the video not buffering was a totally developmentally normal 5yr old reaction. Her not noticing a WHOLE IPAD in the trash?? Extremely weird and totally her fault.", "> So I did some digging and found the iPad in her bag, it had been factory reset and the case was gone so I have a feeling she was going to sell it?\n\nmy first guess", "OP please google local youth services. It is not CPS but a place that could help you and provide you a safe space to be", "Has your mom been screened by a doctor? Sounds like she needs to be assessed for psychological conditions. \n\nStay strong honey. Hold on and look for the light in the middle of the tunnel. You won't have to deal with this psychosis forever. <3", "If she\u2019s planning to sell it, she had to do the big theatrics so your brother would think you stole it so she doesn\u2019t look bad to him. Is she only bad to you or both you and your brother?", "I know it sucks, but if I were you I would kiss up to your step dad and any other relatives you have. Yes, I know they suck, but you will need support for the next four years. It was in her bag, your step father would never have put it there, I think you should ask your step father to put the iPad under his account with a password you don\u2019t know and turn on location support with find my iPad, as you don\u2019t want to be accused again. Good luck!", "I think it's highly likely that your mother sold your ipad as well.\n\nThe story about you throwing it away is highly dubious. \n\nYour mother probably tells these lies to cover up stealing from her children.\n\nDoes she have a drug habit?", "All of this, but I would urge you to be emotional support for your brother, especially when you move out. You absolutely are not responsible for them financially or physically, but emotional support could mean a world of difference to them. That being said, your own mental health is also important, and like the comment about, a trusted teacher or counselor may be able to help you.", "If OP thinks his stepfather may have done it and that mom has the mental potential to do this sort of thing and forget it, I wonder if the stepfather manipulates mom or fosters her mental disarray.", "I may be wrong but I read that as OP saying there's a possibility the mum's cluelessness is genuine, and that possibility is if it was actually the stepdad who reset it and put it in the bag to possibly sell without telling the mum.\n\nNB OP, even if that is the case and she genuinely didn't know where the iPad was, how she behaved toward you about it is still very much not okay.", "She was going to sell that Ipad just as she sold your Ipad when you were 5. Your mother is abusive and dishonest. She uses you as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to face up to her shortcomings. \n\nI am so sorry you have to live with this. Do your best to make a plan and leave as soon as you are able.", "Don't you have grandparents you could move in with? Close family?\n\nYour situation is not sustainable", "Go to a teacher and ask them for help with CPS and make it known that your family always backs your mom up even by omission of the truth if necessary.", "Hm. Out of curiosity, Do you and your sibling have the same father? If not-  is your stepdad your siblings\u2019 biological father?", "She's  gaslighting you.", "She tried to gaslight you and convinced everyone else as well. \n\nIf she can't trust you, then don't babysit. I'd also look into recording her antics for investigations. I wish we could do more for you. \ud83d\ude14", "This update really makes me wonder what really happened to the first iPad. She could easily have done the same thing and was blaming you because that\u2019s exactly what she did the first time she sold off an iPad. It would be really messed up if she just accused you to take the heat off herself.", "I think *op* is raising the possibility it was the step dad.", "Do you remember throwing the iPad away? If not, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s lying", "Your mom is gaslighting you, she definitely did this herself. The reason why I am so sure is because she is acting exactly like my own mother who is a narcissist (yes, several psychiatrists have confirmed that she is) and alcoholic. We no longer have any contact since many years.\n\nTrust me when i say that she knew where the iPad was. Especially if this behavior is something she does on the regular (meaning she blames everyone around her for stuff that goes wrong or goes missing etc). She needs professional help, ASAP. If your stepdad won't help you, ask for outside help and tell them about her behavior. Give as much information and details as you can.", "My mom did this when she was in the worst part of a drug addiction and needed money. She sold my Wii and told me it had been stolen by my step brother", "Listen, kiddo, I'm really sorry to have to tell you this, but your brother didn't factory reset his device, and you didn't throw away your iPad, either. She is selling these items and probably others. I'm willing to bet you've \"lost\" shoes before, am I right?\n\nHide your money, keep your valuables on you at all times, and start exploring where you can go if home isn't safe anymore. She's worse than you think and I'm worried for you.", "THIS!! ^", "OP\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you didn\u2019t throw away the iPad when you were little. It\u2019s highly likely, imo, that your mom took it and sold it before pinning it on you. And she\u2019s doing it again now.", "I am sorry OP but all signs, the reset, case taken off, all point to her selling it and was trying to blame you so your Mum could throw you under the bus with your brother e.g. \"Don't get upset with me, it was your brother who stole it!\" etc", "I have problem with original  throw out of  an ipad at age 5,   those  had only existed for 3 years and those where not cheap  and  they where  heavier then todays. Honestly if you had one, your mom most likely sold it. Since you have zero memories , it most likely never happened, because  getting retold the story, should trigger memories.", "Your mother is gaslighting you. Please checkout r/raisedbynarcissists. I think you will find it eye-opening.\n\nPS my mother did EXACTLY the same thing to me but about some very expensive sewing scissors. When they were found (in her srwing room) she told me that she wouldn't have had to tear apart my room if I wasn't such a pig (my room was not a mess before she trashed it). She'd dumped everything into a pile in the middle of my floor. Even the curtains from the window, stripping the bed, taking everything out of the closet and dresser.", "My parents stole from me as a kid, and lied about it until I was older. It's gross. It sucks. It fucks you up and makes you not trust people as an adult. It's a violation of trust, of privacy, of agency and personhood. \n\nI'm sorry, and you're not to blame. Remember not everyone will be like this, in the future. There are good people.", "Your mom might have a drug addiction or gambling addiction. Definitely has narcissistic tendencies. She probably sold your iPad when you were 5 and blamed you for it, and now she suddenly needs money again, so she thought she could pull the same crap, and blame you again. It\u2019s not just that she needs money, it\u2019s that she needs a hidden source of money, because what she is spending that money on she is keeping a secret from your stepdad, and everyone else.\nThere\u2019s really not much you can do but try to survive, especially with your stepdad turned against you. She probably told him a lot of bad things about you that aren\u2019t true. Don\u2019t expect any help AT ALL from them once you turn 18. I can almost guarantee they will force you out of the house, and refuse to give you any kind of Info that you might need from them in order to fill out college paperwork like loan applications or grant applications. It sucks a lot! I\u2019m Sorry!\nI survived that kind of situation by having friends I could be roommates with. I worked 3 jobs to pay my share of rent, and food. I had to wait until I was 24 to go to college, because that was the age that they no longer make you put down your parent\u2019s financials. Good luck! \nAlso, Don\u2019t worry about trying to salvage any kind of relationship with your mom, it\u2019s not your responsibility to do that, you just focus on surviving. She\u2019s the one who chose to make you the enemy, she can live with the consequences.", "Your mom has mental health issues....she purposefully took the iPad so she can blame you knowing full well you didn't do it", "Keep in mind who sides with your mom in saying you were selfish to suggest that she follow through with her threat to call the police.\n\nThese people are not trustworthy. They are her flying monkeys and will be sent after you any time you don't behave the way she wants... For the rest of your life. So keep their names in mind so you can discount their views when they speak up telling you how awful you are and how great your toxic mother is. Sorry about your family.", "The mothers reaction to the missing I pad seemed extreme.  And the fact that she kept it up.  Sounds like someone was reinforcing her belief that OP was to blame.  \n\nAny chance the step dad is doing it to the mother. To mess with her and the kids.  He takes the iPad resets it so it can\u2019t be found.  Drops a a suggestion of what might have happened to it.
