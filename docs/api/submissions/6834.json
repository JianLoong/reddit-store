Unfortunately she went at it with  reckless abandon and completely ruined the pot because by the time she  was finished with it the bottom was completely wrecked and uneven. She  tried to cover what she had done by placing the pot back with the other  cleaned pans and pots but unfortunately for her one of the guests at the  party brought some chicken and S went for the pot in order to reheat it  for the dinner and discovered what happened.

When I said it probably stung  replacing such a pricy item (Staub Cocotte) she said she didn't \"feel  the need to spend that much on a pot\" and order some Amazon Basic  equivalent. I explained to her that while it could look like they're the same a Staub is well above an Amazon Basic when it comes to quality but  she kept saying it was the same and that prompted my cheapskate  comment.\n\nNow, I realize not everybody knows what a Staub is but if you ruined a friend's possession (whatever it is) shouldn't you **at least**  replace it with the same item (or ideally better)? Or am I the asshole here calling her a cheapskate and she did the right thing while spending less than half?

And no, it's not ok to replace a valuable item you broke with a cheap one, that is just plain wrong.", "**NTA**\n\nLook, I'm objectively poor, and there are times I look at the prices of some good quality cookware and just cringe. I certainly can't afford it for myself, though I wish I could. But that's the thing: what you're talking about isn't something that is expensive just as a luxury or an indulgence. While there are certain things you can buy for the kitchen where cheap is as good as anything, when it comes to cookware quality DOES legitimately matter, and people who love to cook and spend a lot of time doing it often invest in good quality pieces not because they are wealthy but because it IS an investment in quality and something that can last for many years. My mother was given a Le Creuset deep roasting pan with cover as a wedding gift in the '60s and was still using it regularly until my dad accidentally did something similar to what your sister did and ruined the finish . . . less than 5 years ago.  There's a reason why that thing was worth hundreds of dollars; it more than paid for itself over the years. Cast iron cookware, in particular, can literally be handed down through GENERATIONS if it is maintained properly. The same is definitely not true of \"Amazon Basics\".\n\nYour sister did the equivalent of ruining a piece of investment artwork and replacing it with an IKEA preframed poster. Sure, technically you can hang them both on an empty wall and they'll look pretty, but it's deeply disingenuous to suggest that they are \"the same thing\".\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, and your sister should honestly be embarrassed that she'd call herself a friend whilst trying to cheat Sara out of a proper replacement. If she couldn't afford to replace the pot with the same or equivalent, then it warranted a conversation about, \"I understand what I did wrong, how can I make this right in a way that I can afford?\" What she did instead was just gross and not how you treat friends.", "NTA\n\nShe should have replaced it with the exact same brand/model, so she is definitely wrong there. \n\nThat said, cast iron is pretty resilient - your friend should be able to (eventually) get it back in working order. NOT to say your sister shouldn't replace it of course! But at least if it is a sentimental item, she should be able to fix it with time.", "NTA\n\nI received a STAUB set for my birthday awhile back and I guard that set with my life.

First she tried to hide the fact she destroyed another person's property, then she tried to avoid accountability by playing dumb. And to put the cherry on the asshole sundae she replaces an expensive item she ruined with one that is cheaper and of less quality.

Common etiquette demands that if you ruin something that isn't yours, you replace it with the same item or something of at least equal value.
