Not trying to imply that you are trans, or if you are, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf you want the haircut, go out and get the haircut. If they try being at all passive aggressive about this shit when you do, or try confronting you, say: \"it's my hair, I can do what I want with it, and it will grow back. I'm an adult that doesn't NEED permission.\" Also, I would SERIOUSLY consider taking your parents to counselling and see if you can get your brother on your side with this shit, because this behaviour from them is absolutely unacceptable.", "NTA. \n\n>But honestly yeah they really need to stop this and get a reality check on what day and age we live in.\n\nI would argue that YOU need a reality check. You're an adult, you shouldn't be asking for your parents' permission to change something as trivial as your hair.", "Then she either has to help out neighbors for a little bit of money (just sacrifice a couple of hours each day and she'd have enough in a couple of days)  or just get a pair of scissors and a YouTube video and cut them herself. Or if there's a hairdresser school or something near her she could ask there for a free haircut.", "She replied on another comment that she\u2019s afraid they will be mad. I think she\u2019s too young to realize what a toxic environment she lives. This might be a cultural situation where kids can\u2019t decide without their parents approval? If that\u2019s not the situation then get out. I hope school means college and you can move out as soon as you graduate and get a job. Best wishes to OP.", "You are 21, why are you asking permission?  Get a job, pay for it yourself, move out.\n\nNTA", "Wait. Are you 12 or 21? From your post I really had to double check to see if it wasn\u2019t a typo regarding your age. You are an adult. Go to work, go to school and get out of your parents house. This is an abusive situation.", "NTA you realize you are 21 right? You can leave your parents\u2019 house without permission.", "Info: why don\u2019t you just get it done? Why would you even ask?", "NTA. I'm glad you're getting the haircut, but I think you need to sit and analyze the core issue here. Your parents have a lot of control over your life including your body, you should probably start looking around your area to see if there are resources where you could leave their house so you can start building your own life. They are clipping your wings", "I had similar issues when I lived with my mom. I wasn\u2019t allowed out late. I couldn\u2019t do this, couldn\u2019t do that. She was very strict. I\u2019m 21f, just moved out in may. The best bet is to find a good enough paying job and save up for a car and an apartment.", "She's 21....not 12.", "It's not really a gender thing, I just don't find it attractive.  I'm not attracted to blondes either.", "Look, my dad was one of those guys who believed women should have long hair. While he encouraged it, he also has three highly independent daughters who do their own thing. The compromise? We cut our hair short, he gets to ruffle it once.", "NTA. Why is your Dad so invested in your looks? This has some major r/incest vibes.", "I can\u2019t imagine not only not being allowed to control my own appearance as an adult, but being gaslighted into thinking I\u2019m an asshole for wanting to. This is what abuse does to people.", "NTA.  Are you in school?  If not, or even if you are, you should get a job (part-time if you are in school).  This would allow you to earn some money to be able to do these things without parental approval.  Yes, you are an adult, but you need to be able to finance adult decisions and it sounds like you haven't figured that part out yet.  Best of luck.", "Funny you say that....tattoos can appear taboo in some countries..  In others it's a status symbol.  Again....just different...not wrong or right ....its just their way.", "I think many here take for granted or just assume everyone has the same Social rules? Or family Dinamics.  Many countries still have, just as you explained heirachies or traditional rules that have remained the same due to differing political rule or simply being so far removed from western standards.  That doesn't make it wrong or right.  The internet has just opened up many of the more submissive ways of living to the Western ways of self autonomy...or choosing for yourself how you live with little to no restrictions.  I find it interesting personally.  In some ways the Western way has gone a little too unrestrictive. On the other side some of the more hierarchy driven setups are craving personal freedom.  Look at what Iranian women are experiencing right now?  Pretty amazing!", "I don\u2019t think she does have to ask her parents, I think she\u2019s just a little dense that growing up requires changing the dynamic. Since she asks, they give her a response. Grow up OP. Take responsibility for yourself and act like an adult.", "I learned the hard way to show pictures of the cut you want. It wasnt a great outcome after trying to describe it.", "It\u2019s clearly a gender thing or you would just prefer long OR short hair. You prefer long hair hair on girls (gender) only."]}
