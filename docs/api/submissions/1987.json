Are there cultural factors impacting things\u2026? Not to say your/your parents\u2019 culture should dictate how you choose to wear your hair, but it sounds like a more nuanced situation\u2026and/or your parents are very controlling and you should move out asap\u2026", "Then go do it girl! Live your life and go rock a pixie cut! It's hair, tell your parents it will grow back. Chop off your hair and be free of the weight and hassle! You will love it and go enjoy your life. You are getting the hair cut for you, not for anyone else. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around your parents not liking your hair... because you don't get dressed and style your hair for them, you do it for you because you like it.\n\nYou need to do what you like and what makes you feel confident. If that's getting a pixie cut, then what are you waiting for?\n\nPs. You might want to think about moving out (your parents sound toxic)", "So who cares? Let them be mad.", "If you don't want it use money, just do it yourself. There are tons of haircut tutorials on YouTube. Just pic an easy-ish cut that can still be fixed by a professional if you happen to screw it up.", "Ok, so if its purely a financial problem would they be willing to gift the haircut to you or give you money for birthdays/Xmas? Got to admit, I'm not even sure how much haircuts are nowadays. I cut my own hair, partly due to price, partly due to convenience but I don't think a pixie cut is doable at home. What about trainee hairstylists. Don't they tend to charge less?", "i mean ik everyones financial situation is different but theres plenty of cheap places to get ur hair cut (great clips, super cuts, etc) that cost under 20 dollars if i remember correctly, ive been exclusively going to great clips for my entire 20 years of life and they do decent work when it comes to shorter hair. if its financial id recommend going somewhere like that, but if they took your brother but refuse to take you it seems like it might not just be that.", "Fine that they think that, but the question of WHY you are asking their consent remains.\n\nWhy do you need their permission if you said yourself that you can pay for it?", "you continue to not answer the question of why you\u2019re even asking for permission!!! i\u2019ve seen like ten people asking you why you are even asking and you refuse to answer. just go do it. do you also ask to buy new clothes or what to eat for dinner? you said somewhere \u201cit\u2019s not like it\u2019s a tattoo\u201d okay but you could also get a tattoo??? you are a fucking adult!!!", "INFO : Do you have a job? Is public transit an option?", "Is it too far for public transport or walking?", "It'll be really cute if you have straight-to-wavy hair, and it's dead easy. It absolutely does not look un-feminine either.", "Then why are you asking permission?", "So then just go do it... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If you're paying for it, I don't see how they have any say over this at all. It's your hair, it's your money, do whatever you want. NTA", "Cutting my hair was also a gateway to piercing my ears with a friend without telling my parents too hahah. Controlling ur own hair is sometimes the scary but most crucial step to getting that confidence when it comes to expressing urself", "Okay that's not bad for me a haircut, save money and go yourself. I think another comment er mentioned getting a job at your school. There are probably lots of things options some of which them academic. In know some people had jobs worming on papers with other students and the hours seemed flexible. So I it's not like an 8 hour job that could interfere with your studies.\n\nIf your parents don't want want you to work during school the trade off is that they should pay for things. No reason why you can't get a haircut.", "She doesn\u2019t drive. She takes the bus to school and in another comment she said she would have to take the bus to the salon so I don\u2019t see what her actual issue is.", "If they don\u2019t let you make decisions, they\u2019re failing you. You need to be able to make your own decisions and learn what is best for you!", "That's really sad.", "Do that again, then.\nI'm having a hard time believing this is for real, that a 21 year old has to get permission for a haircut.", "It\u2019s possible they\u2019ll kick her out for not obeying their rules.", "Could also be a different culture than yours. What may be considered \u201cnormal\u201d in our culture may not be the same for others", "I never thought of that but thank you for the info! I do read a lot because of my major but yeah I\u2019ll look up at my university for options of a campus job or elsewhere", "I think OP is struggling with the concept of disobeying her parents. Obedient children become obedient adults.", "Well, it sort of is. OP is an adult. Her parents are not obliged to house her. They could, in theory, tell her that if she had her hair cut, they'd kick her out of the house. They'd be AHs for doing so, of course, but...", "My dad immigrated from Mexico at a young age and my mom is mixed race Mexican. I did think a while ago if it was a cultural factor that they wouldn\u2019t let me cut it. I was blessed with my maternal grandfather\u2019s thick hair and I do keep my hair healthy", "Thank you, just this you are totally right. Ngl they have been toxic in some instances (like when they get into arguments and I have to be mediator) but yeah I probably have to give them a talking to again. For context I\u2019m the oldest/firstborn. It\u2019s only me and my brother", "I\u2019ll definitely look into that, thanks for the info!", "No I don\u2019t have a job. I do take the bus to school.", "I do have to walk to get to the bus", "^ this.\n\n If you are paying for it,  they can't tell you what to do with your hair, even if you live at home.\n\n You may need to use public transport  or ask a friend if you don't have your own wheels to get there", "Yeah if there are buses she should just do it", "It will either slowly get better on its own when OP moves out and parents can't see her every move, so she doesn't feel the judgement pressure so much, or OP will get into therapy.", "I have 4 kids, 3 of them are neurodivergent. My daughters are 10 & 12. My husband and I also don't like short hair on girls, or long on boys. Personal preference. They both wanted pixie cuts a couple years ago. Guess what? They got the cut they wanted. My boys are 8 and 21, both have long hair. It's not my body to control. Kids are people with their own likes, not a mini me.", "And please be prepared - if this is how they treat your brother vs you, when it\u2019s his time to \u201clive at home and focus on school\u201d he won\u2019t be held to the same standards as you. He\u2019ll have freedom, he\u2019ll have a job, heck he might not even do the live at home part.\n\nGender disparate parenting is never small potatoes. It always escalates to more unequal treatment as you get older.", "That\u2019s definitely a strange family if you have to tip toe around something as normal and harmless as a haircut though. This post is so baffling to me, I can be an obedient son and still do normal things lol", "If they're so controlling that they would kick her out because they don't like the length of her hair, then she's better off not living with them.", "Did you know that you are allowed to do things even if your parents say no?", "no. no, no no. *no*. you do not need to talk to them.\n\njust get the haircut. \n\ngo get your hair cut.\n\nthis isn't a debate, a negotiation, or a group decision. it's your hair. cut it.", "ESH: Youre not wrong to ask for help from the people who take care of you, however this is a situation you let yourself be in. I suggest you get even a part time job near the school (take the bus to school on days you dont attend) to get some freedom money. You cant rely on your parents forever, or youre going to keep getting into situations where youre under thier control to your detriment.", "Is there any hair salon near your school? Usually there is at least one or two for the students who live in the dorms. Just catch a bus to go to school as normal and then do a haircut while you are on campus.", "It's what happens when the parents are too strict in childhood and sort of \"break\" their kid so the kid is reliant on their opinion and approval well into adulthood, even when living independently.", "In some cultures the mark of a \u201cbad girl\u201d is having her hair short because long hair \u201cis a woman\u2019s glory.\u201d", "I won't disagree with you, but if being thrown out is a likely outcome, then it's better to plan for that in advance, rather than getting the haircut and then discovering your bags on the front doorstep."]}
