And by that, I mean like we would take family vacations two to three times per year. It's still like that now, but I've noticed a difference in how my family acts now that my (F27) wife (F24) and I are married. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, my dad booked a trip to Italy. Everyone was excited, the family gc was lit up for days following the announcement. I called my dad and talked to him for a while and eventually I thanked him for including my wife who'd always felt left out. There was a slight pause and he told me that he booked the rest of the available seats on that particular flight and there was only enough for him, my mother, grandparents, my sister + her husband, and me. He booked it without even taking my wife into consideration. Now I know what a lot of people would think that it was just a mistake but I don't think so given the fact that my wife has been excluded in other ways before and if it were a mistake, he'd do everything he could to change it before even announcing the vacation.\n\nMy heart sunk. I looked at my wife who could tell something was off and I told my dad to just give my seat to someone else because if she wasn't included, I wasn't going. In the past, I was able to include my wife myself but I was tired of us being singled out. They never did that to my sister and her husband, they've always included them as a couple. But when it comes to my wife and I, we've always had to figure our own way into the mix as if we weren't to be taken seriously. I'm not doing that now and I drew the hard line in the sand this time. This man had the audacity to say that her and I could book our own flight and just, you know, *meet them there*. I simply said \"absolutely not\" then hung up.\n\nNeedless to say, my wife was in tears. She was upset, but she was glad that I was sticking by her. A couple of days went by and we decided to go on our own vacation to a much humbler location (large rental cabin) with her family, who are all downright amazing. Well...my family found out and they have not stopped blowing up my phone. My mom called me one night during all this and said that I was being unreasonable and that there's no way I couldn't just book a separate flight and instead book an entirely different vacation with her family. I explained to her that that wasn't the point, that the point was that they have excluded my wife from every family-related event ever since we got married which always put me in the position to fix it. My mom basically called me crazy and that I was overthinking a simple mistake on my dad's part.  \n\nFor some reason, I'm starting to think that maybe I am overthinking it and that I should just talk with my dad to see if excluding my wife was intentional (which was another point my mom brought up).

They're trying to gaslight you so word doesn't get out about slighting your wife on several occasions. They look petty AF and they know it.", "NTA. Your dad did it on purpose. You did exactly right. Spend time with people who will appreciate your family, not just you. Your parents can be included when they can be respectful to your spouse. And you tell anyone who brings it up in no uncertain terms that exactly.", "NTA OP. Your family are homophobes.\n\nHomophobes.\n\nThis is a hill you must, must die on. They have shown multiple ways that they do not accept your marriage and never will. You're married now. Your wife deserves to come first. Her family, who are clearly not homophobicand have accepted your relationship, should come before the family you were born into.", "NTA\n\nIf it was just an honest mistake on dad's side, why didn't he apologize and offer to fix it? No way that was not on purpose. And calling it \"overthinking\" is a pretty common gaslighting tactic by narcissists.\n\nYou did the right thing and I hope you'll have a great time with your wife's family. Yours doesn't deserve you.\n\nETA: Could your family have homophobic reasons to treat your marriage as less than? If so, they are even bigger AHs. Either way, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n> he told me that he booked the rest of the available seats on that particular flight and there was only enough for him, my mother, grandparents, my sister + her husband, and me.\n\nMan, I would **LOVE** for you to look up that flight, confirm that there are PLENTY of seats left, and confront him with the evidence.\n\n> I was overthinking a simple mistake on my dad's part. \n\nEx*cuse* me?\n\n**Hating his daughter** is no fucking **_mistake_**.", "NTA. Your family fully excluded your wife and you stuck up for her.\n\nEdited to add:  seriously. Good for you. Your family sounds homophobic and are trying to make you feel like you did something wrong. You. Did. Nothing. Wrong. And you drew a very healthy boundary.", "Absolutely not the asshole. Sorry, but your Dad sounds like a nasty piece of work for doing that. It was deliberate.", "NTA. It wasn't an accident, it fits a pattern of exclusion. Good for sticking up for your spouse!", "NTA. You are not overthinking anything. You have interpreted this situation for what it is, deliberately excluding your wife. Your marriage will last because you stand by your wife and you treat her as she's the most important person in your life. Sounds as if the in-laws are good people. Always try to surround you and your wife with good people. Maybe give parents and extended family a good leavin alone for awhile.", "Wow, I find it hard to imagine this was a mistake on your dad's part. And if it were, wouldn't he then fix it? Why would you have to book your own flight and then spend your holiday with your homophobic family? That does not sound fun at all! So NTA, you made the right choice. You can still have that conversation with your dad, but I doubt he will say it was intentional. You probably have to have a different conversation with him about whether he accepts your wife as family and how he intends to show that?", "**NTA**\n\nAnd your mom was wrong, it wasn't a \"simple mistake\", it wasn't a mistake at all. \n\nBecause no matter how long you and your wife have been married, I'd be hard-pressed to believe that your dad magically forgot that you ARE married. No one books a vacation for themselves, their own spouse, their parents, their kids, and their kids' spouses, and somehow \"forgets\" that one of their kids is married and that they need to include that kid's wife. The very suggestion of it is preposterous.\n\nEither you and your wife have been married for a while, in which case your dad \"forgetting\" one of his own daughters-in-law suggests a serious medical issue that he should probably have checked out . . . or you are relatively newly married, in which case your wedding should be fresh in his mind, and it's even stranger that he would somehow \"forget\" the DIL that his daughter literally JUST married recently. \n\nNope. He forgot nothing, and this wasn't a mistake. I'm sure there will be plenty of speculation about his motives (homophobia will likely be the primary suspect) but I won't even do that, because I don't know your dad so I have no idea what his motives would be. Perhaps it is homophobia, but perhaps he just doesn't like your wife. Doesn't matter. No matter what his motives are, he and your mother are being disingenuous by pretending that consistently excluding their own daughter's wife from family events is no big deal. It's the BIGGEST deal. And you have every reason not to want to be around them if this is how they are going to treat the woman you have chosen to spend your life with.\n\nYou are 100% NTA, and they owe you a huge apology. And even then, you still don't need to vacation with them. Go enjoy yourselves with the side of the family that treats you BOTH with love and kindness.", "NTA in any form. Your dad is though because he's showing some favoritism to your sibling and homophobia to you and your wife.", "NTA. Your parents sound like they\u2019re trying to gaslight you.", "Nobody thinks it was a mistake. It was entirely deliberate, you're NTA, your family is horrid, and I'm glad hers isn't.", "You definitely should talk to your dad but you are NOT the asshole, her family is also your family and apparently have been more accepting. I have vacationed with my wife\u2019s family but never with my own as they are toxic when everyone is together. My family has never had issue with it, they are aware that our relationship would strain if we all had to spend a week or so in close quarters.", "Absolutely NTA! Well done OP! Your parents intentionally excluded your wife in multiple occasions and you did the right thing drawing a line and assuring her you are on her side! \n\nI vaguely remember there was another AITA post a while ago with a similar situation. Except author of that post was a man and did not have the gut to stand up for his wife. You absolutely did the right thing!", "NTA - Without going into specifics, I've been in your shoes. I've been married 15 years now, and my mother and I still don't talk because of it. My life is far more peaceful knowing the holidays, vacations, and general thoughtfulness will include both me, my spouse, and the collective family who have always included us. I'm not saying you *need* to go low/no contact, but I am saying the drama and stress in my life sure has diminished since.", "NTA. \n\nYour family sucks though. If it was a *simple mistake* on your father's part, then he could have simply booked another ticket. He purposely iced your wife out and your mother falls right in line with his bullshit if she's not already directly involved. That is some serious gaslighting. I'd personally go NC with my family if they did that. Good for you for being a loyal loving husband!", "ESH\u2026EXCEPT for you and your wife. You should be proud of the way you stood your ground for you and your wife.", "You're NTA. It was no \"simple mistake\", it was a deliberate snub. Good for you standing up for your wife. If your parents wanted to show good faith and prove it was an accident,  one of them coule have given up his/her seat and taken a later flight.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t overthinking it. You and your wife are being excluded. It would be interesting yo hear why they include your sister\u2019s husband but not your wife, if they keep saying it\u2019s not intentional.", "NTA.\n\nYour relationship with your wife comes first.  If there is a pattern of behavior here, you don't have to ignore it.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to have a sit-down with your parents after this to make it clear just how cruel and unfair their behavior has been, and to make it clear that if they continue to do this, you and your wife will be forced to find alternatives away from your family--but your decision on this trip to just do something entirely different is completely justified either way.", "NTA - Stand your ground. I don't buy the \"booking\" BS for a second. Reread what you wrote and see how bad it sounds, especially since you mentioned you have been slighted before. Really nice to see you have her back. Just want to say my daughter and her wife live about 30 minutes from here and I can say I have the best daughter-in-law ever. I've seen this passive/aggressive thing before unfortunately.", "NTA.  Your father did it purposefully.  Go low contact.", "NTA. Your family is homophobic and good for you for sticking up for your wife. Also, a Lake cabin vacation sounds lovely to me and you won\u2019t have to spend the whole time trying to make sure your wife isn\u2019t left out or ignored.", ">my wife has been excluded in other ways before\n\nOnce is a mistake.\n\nMore than once, your dad is a homophobe, your mother enabling it and your anger is justified.\n\nI hope you'll continue to vacation as a couple instead of spending time with these toxic people.  Even with an apology, I'd be wary about motives going forward.", "NTA.  It was intentional.  I\u2019m so sorry.  This must hurt your wife so much.  Be with people who love you and accept your marriage.", "NTA - as op has stated this is an ongoing issue yiu can excuse leaving ops wife out once as a \u201cmistake\u201d but if it was a true mistake they\u2019d have the common sense not to make it twice, if not more times given that OP has only stated that in the past sh a been able to sort) \n\nProps to OP for not engaging with their toxic behaviour and sticking up for her wife", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The person youd give a spare key to) really helps. After you get through the first few holidays without them, you think gee those were uneventful and quiet. Then, on the third or fourth celebration, without the negativity, you realize it's not that it's uneventful or quiet. It's that the stress those people place on you is no longer hovering over your head and creating this dynamic where you just *know* you're going to have to fix something/someone. It gets easier.
