To be clear, I lived in Florida WAY longer than I wanted because I didn\u2019t want to take my son away from his father, as much as I hated Florida. The tipping point in me moving was I started having seizures and other health problems and the doctors couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. My mom and sister offered to move me up to North Carolina so I could be closer to family and get help for my medical issues.

But what I find most interesting is that your problem seems to be one of you being overwhelmed. And that\u2019s understandable. But had he not moved, you would be just as overwhelmed, if not more so. Btw, where is the family support you spoke of? \n\nThe super interesting part is that your solution is that you want money to \u2018babysit\u2019 your own kid. This is what you said.

Now you expect to be paid for watching your own child on top of the help you get with your bills. \n\nIf the truth is you need a break why aren\u2019t you hiring childcare and asking him to pay 50% for it so he\u2019s covering his \u201cparenting time\u201d and you\u2019re covering your own? Unless you\u2019re just mad he\u2019s working so hard and not helping out with his child and your solution is to bleed him for money.\n\nYta", "NAH - You two have dug the hole for yourselves.  The title of this post made me think you were a little nuts?  Paid to babysit your own child?  After reading this, ok, I get it.  The rest of us call this child support.  Don't call it \"being paid to watch our child\".  Call it what it is.  \n\nHowever.  There's a lot of pertinent information missing in your post.  What does the father pay for?  Does he pay rent?  Utilities?  Does he pay for the child's healthcare, clothing, food?  None of this is clear, so it's impossible for anyone to provide you unbiased advice on this, since you're actually living with the father, even if you're not \"together\".\n\nThere are thousands of families where one parent works all day away from the home, and the other is home, either working, or just working as a homemaker.  There is plenty of room for inequity in these situations.  That's normal.  What you two are doing is not normal.  It worked.  Until it didn't.\n\nThe father sounds like he's not a horrible human being.  He's trying, to one degree or another.  As are you.\n\nHere's my unbiased advice.\n\nFather needs to move out.  This is step one.  Nothing else can happen until this is accomplished.\n\nA formal, legal agreement needs to be struck.  This is for the child's benefit.  The child's wellbeing is paramount, and leaving him to the whims of his parents is not enough.  Both of you should agree to sit down with a lawyer, either together, or separately, and try to hash out as amicable an agreement as possible, and then stick to it, or there will be legal consequences.  As of right now, you are at the father's mercy, because from what you'd stated, he doesn't need to buy the cow because he's getting the milk for free.", "You need to remove your child's other parent from your house and establish a custody agreement. This is not going to get better as long as you two are living together like this.", "I would say that you need to hire some help either a cleaning person or a nanny. NTA", "NTA. Your situation isn\u2019t great right now. Maybe get a cleaner and/or a nanny that your ex will have to pay for, so you have less childcare/ household duties. Paying you money doesn\u2019t really solve the problem.", "If you don't want to go to court to have set expectations tell him to hire a nanny or cleaning person. This can free up some mental health for you and you both benefit.\n\nI work from home with 2 kids during summer break no sitter. It's a huge pain in the ass sometimes because you are focused on work but they want things to do and attention. \n\nNTA but I see 3 choices.\n\nHe moves out and takes on daycare anyway for his time\n\nGo to court and have it settled. However you live together and I dont know how the courts will see that\n\nHe ponies up for part time sitter and / or maid to alleviate the pressure of being wfh and home mom at the same time.", "YTA! You up and moved with your son and you're complaining now because your ex is forced to work ridiculous hours to try to chase you so he can see his son!?!\n\nYou're selfish and really out of touch to even ask this, your choice is what brought on all of this crap!", "ESH When you wfh you should not be also performing childcare. Your actions are unfair to your employer and his attitude is unfair to you. \n\nI don\u2019t think that paying you is the solution because status quo will be the same. I think that you ex and you should be splitting childcare costs. I also think that your ex should be paying for a maid if he can\u2019t do his half of the chores.", "YTA. You are benefiting from him as he's paying 50/50 to live with you. And you moved away from him, taking his child. He HAD to move to be with you to see his child. That's a huge commitment on his part, IMO. Just because he likes the mountains doesn't change the fact that it was YOUR decision to do this. \n\nI'm assuming this living situation is temporary. Once he moves out and you establish a custody arrangement, none of this will matter.", "You aren\u2019t babysitting your child. It\u2019s called parenting. YTA", "He really needs his own place and ya'll need to sit down and talk this out", "It\u2019s", "Child support is for the child\u2019s expenses. In this situation it\u2019s kinda hard to determine how that works", "If I was making more money and my ex was left to do 100% of the childcare and the household work, I 100% would pay more in bills or compensate him somehow. \n\nLook this isn\u2019t about the money. He would be paying me enough to make bank. He doesn\u2019t respect how hard I work. He doesn\u2019t respect that I\u2019m taking on all of this added stuff because of his long hours. I first asked him to cut down on hours - he wouldn\u2019t do that. I then asked him to pay more for household bills . He didn\u2019t want to do that. He\u2019s the one that said. \u201cWhy would we pay for a babysitter when you\u2019re home? I\u2019m trying to save up money and it\u2019s stupid to spend it when you can do it anyway.\u201d", "Also, to be clear, he\u2019s living in MY house. For $500 a month because I wanted to give him a good deal. You couldn\u2019t find a nice of a place as were in for even $2500 a month. The fact that you think I\u2019m the AH for wanting him to help me out is absolutely crazy.", "Thank you thank you thank you. \n\nI want him to move out eventually so we can snitch start our own lives. But right now, the situation is fine. Ppl think it\u2019s weird. I get that. But it works for us. He really is a good person and parent. He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand the situation I\u2019m in. Like he thinks it\u2019s no big deal and really is easy to do - taking care of my son. His thought process is - you work from home; it\u2019s so easy to have one kid around. It\u2019s not that hard. He just isn\u2019t registering how hard it really is. It\u2019s like he has blinders on and thinks I\u2019m being melodramatic. I don\u2019t want to get courts involved but I know I\u2019m going to have to if this keeps up. I\u2019ll try talking to him again. Thanks for your input!", "Thank you. I think because he\u2019s not home much, he doesn\u2019t realize his much attention our child needs. He just doesn\u2019t get it. He thinks it should be easy and that I\u2019m being melodramatic.", "Correct. I am doing everything - from doctors appointments to staying home when he\u2019s sick to taking him on field trips, attending performances, PTA meeting, etc. \n\nHere\u2019s my deal: I asked him to get a better job where he can spend more time with his son and help me out. He doesn\u2019t want to because he likes his job and gets paid a lot. \n\nThen, I suggested splitting up chores and kids stuff. He tried to do that but his schedule simply doesn\u2019t allow time for him to do the things he needs to. Essentially, I gave him an ultimatum: either be a 50% parent and actually make the effort to do these things. If you can\u2019t than you need to start paying 65% of the bills to compensate for your lack of help around the house. In the beginning I didn\u2019t specifically say \u201cpay me to babysit our child.\u201d \n\nThen I was invited to join this meditation class on Wednesdays but it was during a time he would be working. I said he can pay for a babysitter while I\u2019m gone because it\u2019s unfair that I fill in for him while he works 6 days a week but I can\u2019t get one hour to do something for myself for an hour. It turned into a huge fight where he said it was my responsibility to watch our kid when he works and I shot back that if we didnt live together, he would have to be responsible for what happens with my son 3-4 days of the week and that I wasn\u2019t his babysitter so he could work. Then I said, if you are going to keep making me stay with our son 24/7 then I wanted to be compensated for it. Whether it\u2019s paying me for childcare or paying more for our bills. I just feel like he\u2019s using me (not consciously) but he is when you look at the whole picture. \n\nBottom line: he thinks because I just happen to be around, I should be responsible for my son while hd works. I call bullshit. He needs to step up somehow and compensate me for taking on 100% of the house and child care.", "I\u2019d be fine with that! Originally, I had just asked him to pay more for the house bills and groceries since A) he makes more than I do and B) it would be a way of compensating for what I\u2019m putting in. He didn\u2019t like that. Nor did he like my suggestion of paying me for babysitting. Everything I try to implement something that helps both of us, he shoots it down and gets very defensive. We may need a therapist honestly", "Yes thanks. I think all three of those make perfect sense. I will try all of them - see which one he responds to. Thank you kind internet stranger!", "Hahaha. So true. Thanks for seeing the whole pic.", "You can draft the plan as it is now, it\u2019s great that\u2019s been working.\n\nLet the pros put the financials in based on that, and then you have a good starting point to discuss and confirm it.\n\nI\u2019d suggest not including the financials before making the plan. To avoid biases/conflicts of interest, and first make the best plan for your child all things considered.\n\nNTA his paying 50-50 on the bills is simply a cheaper cost for his living, a cost he would\u2019ve had anyways. It has nothing to do with your daily costs. Is he even sharing the cost of all the drives, extracurricular, medical and other expenses for your child?\n\nIt also excludes the time you\u2019d be 50% off and save childcare/personal cost, like you rightly pointed out. \n\nYou\u2019re nta at all.", "Well driving to and back from school, activities, food, taking care of the house and all the other things she described are child expenses I'd think. \nI'd go about determining based on how much money she spends during that time (gas, groceries etc) plus time spent (arbitrarily or hourly).\n\nAnyways that's not really the point, it's more symbolic not literally child support. I meant what she's asking for is basically the same thing as child support and that's normal.", "I don\u2019t believe you. Respect is a two way street. If you have such an issue, ask him to leave. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re enjoying the perks and you know if he leaves you\u2019ll be back to paying 100% of the bills.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think you just came on here to see if anybody here can give you ammunition to get your way.", "What you be doing if he never moved closer to you? he needs to move out, this isnt good for either of you.", "My apologies, I did not mean to assume, in your second sentence you said you broke up with him. You guys both seem like good people, and you are back to living together now so either decide you want to be back together again, or have some official legal documents drawn up, someone will always feel like they got the short end of the stick if you keep going this way.", "The fact is, they both chose not to involve the courts so therefore, it isn't kidnapping by any law. My mother found that out the hard way when my father tricked her into giving me over for a \"birthday party\" then said she wouldn't see me again. She called the cops, but no custody order meant he could do that", "Yeah I\u2019m starting to see that. He really is a good person and a good dad. We get along great for the most part.\n\nI\u2019m just getting beyond burned out and feel resentful of the fact that I\u2019m doing 100% of the work.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really related to the post, but what\u2019s also happening is that because I\u2019m with my son all the time, I\u2019m the one who actually has to parent my son - Make him do homework, make him take a bath, implement rules and authority, punish him when he deserves it, make him eat healthy and take his vitamins, etc. So the little my son sees my ex, all they do is play video games and eat candy and mess around like they are best friends. So, my son always wants to spend time with his dad because he\u2019s \u201cthe fun one.\u201d \n\nBottom line: it\u2019s incredibly hard, hurtful, and frustrating when there is a father, right here, that can make some changes if he wanted to but isn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m getting a lot of shit for \u201ctrying to squeeze money out of my ex.\u201d But that\u2019s sooo far from the truth. I want HELP. I want another parent to step up so I\u2019m not always to go-to. I feel like I\u2019m drowning and I\u2019ve tried to negotiate so many other things and it\u2019s just not working. Asking him to pay me was a last ditch effort to bring back some semblance of balance.", "Going to court is not going to make him less defensive. Also going to make your living situation unbearable. Do you really think that he will stay living with you and be nice to you if you two are fighting in court?\n\nMy suggestion is to have both of you see a therapist or a mediator so that you can work out an arrangement that is worded in a way that upsets neither of you.\n\nFor example, \u201cI feel overwhelmed and I need help with childcare and chores\u201d is a lot less combative than \u201cYou are the father so you should be paying for childcare and home help.\u201d", "Thank you. That probably is a way better way of doing this. I\u2019m just so confused and frustrated and hurt and overwhelmed. My ex is not a bad guy; I just think he\u2019s burying his head in the sand and doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s actually going on behind the scenes. I\u2019ll try this tactic.", "Haha, I wasn't expecting anything else. It's cute how so many of you act like that.", "People use Christianity as a defense for why they judge those who aren\u2019t Christian by their standards. You can\u2019t say \u201creal Christians don\u2019t\u201d when the people saying hateful things are calling themselves Christians. And I\u2019m saying this as someone who used to be Southern Baptist but is now practicing folk Catholicism. It may not be all Christians, but it certainly is the ones who make the most noise about them being Christian."]}
