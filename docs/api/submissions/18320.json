You are being kind to take his sister in, frankly \n\nNTA\n\nRethink your choice of BF though.", "NTA, it is completely respectable to not want to feel judgement in your own home and you have every right to allow or not allow someone into your home", "NTA! I understand where you are coming from. If she had been a better person, she wouldn't be facing homelessness.", "NTA. Sometimes people have to live with their actions. If she were nicer, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have to be homeless. Never take in someone based off a sad story, because then your only safe space becomes a dreadful place.", "NTA She has had plenty of time to accept you. You don't need the negativity.

Although him saying you are childish for standing up for your well-being might be a deal-breaker about that too...", "NTA. Her actions have consequences. Her housing emergency is not yours. If your bf wants to support his mother with a place to stay, he can move somewhere to support her and his sister.\n\nHonestly, if he's just called you stupid and childish, you should suggest he make his own way (with his family) anyway. Your boundaries are absolutely valid.\n\nEDIT: just saw your comment about his space being \"too small for 3.\" Well, he should move then. Again, not your housing emergency.", "NTA not wanting someone who hates you living with you is pretty normal", "NTA. His mom can stay with him (sofa) or pay for a hotel or hostel or apologise to you and you can consider it moving forwards but you're already doing your bf a favour, he has no right to criticise how much of his family you're willing to take in.", "NTA\n\nIf that is the way your BF treats you, why is he still your BF?\n\n**I call bullshit on the idea that his apartment is not big enough to take his mother and sister in** but your apartment will fit them just fine***.*** Please. He's just happy to not have them staying with him. **If he were truly worried about his mother not becoming homeless, she could sleep on his floor on a blow up mattress.** His sister could sleep on his couch. \n\nI think it is really weird that he is having his family members move in with you when they are in danger of becoming unhoused when you two don't even live together.", "NTA\n\nif he was your husband it would be different and you would need to try to find some solution probably not in your own house.  But frankly your boyfriend's family shouldn't be freeloading off you.", "NTA. His sister can stay with you and he can deal with his mom at his place (it's nice enough of you to offer for his sister to stay!). His mother is old enough to sort out her own arrangements. Why doesn't he want his mother at his place but is ok with you having to put up with her? He's TA here. \n\nIn general, his reaction to your boundaries is a bag full of red flags, I'd rethink whether it's a relationship that should be on going.", "Soooo question;\n\nIs this your place that you own? Does your boyfriend has his own place or are you co tenants?", "Need more info. How long have you and your bf been together? That won't necessarily change the answer, but it could.\n\nEdit: I'm saying NTA, because as other people said actions have consequences. Also your bf doesn't have enough for 3. Well if you let the sister stay with you does he have room for 2? Why can't he figure a way for his mom to stay at his place? What is he doing that his mom can't stay at his place? Also why is he trying to guilt you to take her in, when he must see the way she treats you? Lots of red flags the more I think about all that.\n\nEdit2: Also do we know why they need a place to stay? Not that it really matters, just curious. She made the bed and I bet it's her own fault she can no longer lay in it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
