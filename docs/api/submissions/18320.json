Of course if OP was going to let the Mom move in, it would very much matter. I was just curious if Mom wasn't paying bills, or like you said hoarder, drug addict or anything along those lines...because to criticize OP about things and then to  need her for a place to stay, because of whatever led mom to be out of a place is just karma working it's beautiful magic. That's why I was curious.", "Wow, your boyfriend is manipulative and doesn\u2019t care about you at all. Sign #1: he expects you to move his mother who treats you badly into your home.
