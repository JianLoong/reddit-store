Has your mom looked in grandparent rights in your area? She should to see if they are possible. Normally I am not for GP rights but in this circumstance I am. She shouldn\u2019t be threatening to keep the kids from you and your mom. Keep all texts and voicemails from her as proof of the threats.", "Is she paying you?", "NTA. You are in a hard situation. I am sorry for the loss of your brother and it is amazing that you have stepped up to remain close to your nieces. However, Mona sounds like a total AH. Expecting you to care for 3 children you have no real connect to for almost half the week is unhinged. You cannot sacrifice your life for your nieces\u2019 half siblings. I understand how difficult it must be to enforce the boundary knowing that you may lose access to your nieces. However, given that your brother passed almost 10 years ago, your nieces aren\u2019t babies. The foundation you have built with them will last even if Mona plays hard all and doesn\u2019t let you see them as much.", "NTA . It's selfish of her to push that on you.", "NTA her using your dead brothers memory to shame you is manipulative as F***\n\nFrom her perspective all 6 are her kids and she isn't dividing them into two sets. \n\nNot wanting to babysit 6 kids instead of just 3 is acceptable. Not wanting to babysit just the older 3 is acceptable. \n\nNot wanting to babysit an additional 3 kids for free is acceptable. \n\nIf you still consider her family then her other 3 kids are \"family\" despite not being related. If she is just your nieces baby mama then her kids aren't \"family\".", "Nta. Im sorry but how did seeing your neices turn into free babysitting every weekend though? Im sorry but i wouldn't be seeing my neices anymore under that ultiamtium.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re family, not a baby sitting service, and all considered you may have rights to see your bio members. Check in with a community/family law service if you have one\n\nGood luck", "NTA tbh you shouldn't be babysitting either of them that often, & her giving you an ultimatum made her TAH", "NTA. She is the one who keeps having kids. You aren't responsible for any of them. It is very nice of you to watch the 3 girls.", "NTA - she\u2019s not paying you and that\u2019s a job you can hire people for. Hiring someone for 3 vs 6 is also a much different number for her. She\u2019s very greedy.", "NTA but it would probably make more sense for you to cut down to every other weekend or once a month but still take all six, rather than spend the same amount of time babysitting but only be taking half the kids, no? Mona is definitely the AH for being so ungrateful for all the help you've given and are continuing to give and threatening to cut you off from your nieces, but IMO there is probably a better solution for everyone to be found rather than you continuing to spend every weekend babysitting but only babysitting half the kids. That's not going to make your social life any easier.", "NTA. She's taking full advantage of yall and using the kids as a weapon. Yall have no obligations to the new kids. They are in no way your issue. She should be ashamed of herself for acting like that.", "NTA. she and her husband need to start taking responsibility for taking care of their children on weekends, it is NOT your mom or your job to raise these children. the older kids sounds like they're close to being aged out, and you can resume your relationship with them when they turn 18. \n\ndon't let that woman guilt trip you into raising her brood for her.", "NTA. You should agree to visit all six some and the girls some, but not be a free baby-sitting service. You should sit in a public place (so she can't raise her voice) so you can explain that you are a loving family that shouldn't have love withheld as punishment while everyone respects each's needs and desires. There's 9f the girls are not the same as the babies. All healthy children need time with blood family. All older children need time without babies. All girls need time without boys. And healthy relationships need to be nurtured, not forced. The SIL is obviously using emotional blackmail but it's unwise to call it that outright at first. Lay out that it's unhealthy for you, grandma and all six children for the arrangements you had with three children at your younger ages to be the same with six  at your older ages and does she prefer to ruin the lives of all eight of you by requiring the unhealthy or ruining lives by refusing access when simply agreeing to a modification is best? The \"modification\" is: continuing to have the girls as before so that the new parents can save money and bond with the babies and you'll gladly take all six on special occasions and for emergencies. It must be clear that something is better than nothing and cooler heads must prevail. If she refuses, call her bluff and see how paying for and being a mom full time to six works out. If she stands firm longer than a month, seek legal help to get legal rights to yours.", "No. We do it for free.", "It is unreal that Mona has 6 kids and is just fine handing them off for half of the week. She is in for a rude awakening being a full time parent of 6 if she stops the visits with your nieces.\n\nAlso, not sure where you are located, and I am not a lawyer, but if there was ever a case for court ordered grandparent visitation, this is it. Especially since you can prove you have been raising the girls half the time and the girls are old enough to advocate for themselves.", "Thank you. The youngest is 8 , the oldest 14. I have no connection at all to her other children. The youngest is only 1. She is out with her husband all weekends. Every. Week. Ends. \n\nI don't feel anything for those little boys. Sure I like them, but not enough to look after them Wednesdays &Weekends. My mum wants to accept her conditions, because she feels like my nieces are a part of her son on this planet. I feel the same. But I don't want to look after sons.", "No. I don't like her. I have never liked her. I hate that she married her friend of my brother's.  She is solely my nieces mother. I strongly dislike her and she dislikes us too, she never had a cup of coffee or anything with us. She just drop off the children and leaves.", "So. Mona was working, it started with us ( especially my mum) babysitting her granddaughters after school, until Mona finished. Then she met her new husband in 2016, and since then she decided \" Because your brother cannot fulfil his parental duties you have to do it\".\n\nSo, because we were grieving, we decided we would do it. Help her as much as we can. Then it was every Wednesdays.  Her husband and her went out every weekends , so now it's weekends too.", "I too think it's worth exploring with a lawyer whether it's possible to get any visitation rights BEFORE making a decision.  In some jurisdictions, they may have some.  In others, no.\n\nNTA"]}
