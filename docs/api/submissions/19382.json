My ex (28M) wasn\u2019t involved in her life by his own choosing. Back in December, he reached out. It took some time, talking and a little therapy. He\u2019s been back in  our daughter\u2019s life for about 4 months now. We are working with the courts to establish paternity and for him to get custody. In the meantime, I\u2019ve let him visit her at my place. He\u2019s taken her on day trips. Since getting a bigger apartment, he\u2019s had her spend the night.\n\nHe was supposed to visit her Wednesday, have dinner with us and watch a movie. We try to do things the three of us, per the therapist\u2019s recommendation so she can see us get along. My ex said he\u2019d be over around 6:00.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up. By 6:30, my daughter was hungry, so I fed her. I tried to put off the movie, but eventually let her watch it. She was disappointed about her dad not showing up. I put her to bed at 9. \n\n11:30, my ex calls, freaking out. He said he forgot we were supposed to have dinner. He only remembered because his girlfriend came home from work and asked how everything went. Rather than apologizing, he got mad at me and asked why I didn\u2019t call him. I said I\u2019m not going to chase him down. I already spent 9 months doing that when I was pregnant, begging him to be in her life.  I\u2019m not going to do that now. It\u2019s up to him to make an effort and remember this stuff.\n\nWe had therapy the next day and she\u2019s on my side. However, my ex insists that I should\u2019ve called. I\u2019m frustrated that he hasn\u2019t tried to apologize to our daughter. \n\nMy mom said that I should\u2019ve called. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686336569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145deb5/aita_for_not_reminding_my_ex_he_was_supposed_to/", "score": 1781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In terms of him forgetting plans? From the information in your post I\u2019m going to say no. It was a one off thing, he might\u2019ve had a busy week and it slipped his mind. I\u2019m going to assume your daughter\u2019s happiness is your top priority and a simple text could\u2019ve avoided her being uspet before bed(I say this as a child of divorce) \n\nLike another comment said, a shared calendar would be a good solution for that and to hopefully avoid this from happening again", "NTA because your ex is responsible for his own behavior, but are you really saying you didn't even send a \"Are you coming?\" text?  You are not responsible for him, but you can act like an adult as well and communicate when something happens that you didn't expect like him not showing up to see his child.

It\u2019s nice to get advice from someone who has been in my daughter\u2019s shoes.", "I didn\u2019t.

My dad was the same way. I\u2019m not sure what the specifics of your situation are, but whenever my dad would cancel last minute I would get really upset because I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d. \n\nYears later (now as an adult) he told me that his last minute cancellations were because he was working overtime. After the divorce he lived on his own and had to pick up jobs to support himself and to be able to afford to take me to the zoo, the aquarium, the amusement park all the \u201cfun days\u201d with dad. \n\nIn my case, simple communication with my mother would have probably avoided me being upset. It\u2019s all about finding communication ways that work for you guys, it\u2019s all a learning process.\n\nAll the best to you guys!", "Yes.  I still think you are NTA, but this would have covered that one issue that you could have been better at.", "I don't think it was in any way your responsibility to follow up with him.  \n\nHe's a grown ass man, if he can't remember he has plans with his daughter then that's totally on him and shows he's not taking his responsibilities as a father seriously.", "His cancellations are not work. They\u2019re due to finding other plans. Like, his girlfriend wants to do something. It\u2019s why we\u2019re in therapy right now. He\u2019s learning that he can\u2019t make promises and not follow through. It\u2019s an asshole move to do period, but especially to a little girl who is still learning to trust her dad. If they were for work, I wouldn\u2019t be upset.", "my ex used to do that. it finally got to a point where she didn't want to go with him when he did show up.\n\nNTA he needs to grow up and be responsible, especially if he is talking about custody.

His gf, a person almost wholly unconnected with you, was able to remember he was supposed to spend time with your daughter today. You are not his mother, nor his timekeeper, and definitely not his daily planner. Amazingly\u2026we all walk around with a device that can do that FOR us in our pockets and purses. I doubt very much your Ex doesn\u2019t have a smartphone. You are already having the reminder why he\u2019s not a great guy, and unfortunately, now your daughter is too. \n\nI think you should hold off on arranging the shared custody if you can.

And if he made an honest mistake, it happens - but take responsibility for your error, dude. He\u2019s not a victim of his own actions.", "NTA, ask him when you got appointed as his secretary without your knowledge or consent?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t tell my daughter in advance of plans with him just to protect her from more disappointment. He seems too unreliable and not accountable for his actions.", "NTA but why are you trying to give this guy some custody?

So hard.\n\nYou don't owe him anything besides the common courtesy you'd offer to any living breathing human being.\n\nThat courtesy here is a text at 06:10 \"you okay/plans change?\"\n\nHe's an absolute cock for forgetting dinner/move night with his daughter don't get me wrong, but yeah.

Nah. Obviously not.", "NTA because he should be adult enough to remember- particularly remembering things that are important to his child. \n\nBut, if this is important to your child, and she is disappointed by him forgetting, then you should chase him in these situations.

He\u2019s a grown man who already walked away once. It\u2019s not your job to remind him he created a human being who has feelings and expectations. It\u2019s not your job to make him keep his promises. You already know that. You\u2019ve been there every day making up for all he abandoned.

Should you have called? I actually don\u2019t think so. Like you said, he needs to make this a priority and remember it. You\u2019re not his planner or alarm. \n\nTo be absent for 7 years, he really needs to be on it now if he really wants to be in her life. Remembering an event with his daughter is the bare minimum. I mean, let\u2019s be fucking for real. His girlfriend even remembered and she didn\u2019t even make the plans!", "I forget things all the time. That's why I set reminders in triplicate so that I don't. He's a grown man that can do the same. NTA.", "NTA. He needs to take responsibility for his own schedule.

If you give in, then you\u2019ll always have to give reminder calls. Then he\u2019ll be mad that you didn\u2019t call earlier, or you called too early and he forgot again.

You should have called? What, he shouldn\u2019t have set a reminder, put it in his diary, written it on the fridge, sent himself an email, put a note on his kitchen counter, or any other method of remembering???   \n\nThis is on him, 1000%. You should have called and asked *him* to keep *his* promise to *his* child? No. He presumably remembers to go to work, or meet other commitments without needing to be reminded.", "NTA as far as I can see you've gone above and beyond to include him - it's his responsibility to remember things.", "I would say that for the sake of your child you should have called, as a young boy i remember how i felt when i was ready to get out but was forgotten by the human who was coming to pick me up.", "NTA. Not your job to keep his schedule. It may have been nice for your daughter if you had called him when he was 30 minutes late, so he could have salvaged some of the evening.
