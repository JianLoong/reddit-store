My ex (28M) wasn\u2019t involved in her life by his own choosing. Back in December, he reached out. It took some time, talking and a little therapy. He\u2019s been back in  our daughter\u2019s life for about 4 months now. We are working with the courts to establish paternity and for him to get custody. In the meantime, I\u2019ve let him visit her at my place. He\u2019s taken her on day trips. Since getting a bigger apartment, he\u2019s had her spend the night.\n\nHe was supposed to visit her Wednesday, have dinner with us and watch a movie. We try to do things the three of us, per the therapist\u2019s recommendation so she can see us get along. My ex said he\u2019d be over around 6:00.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up. By 6:30, my daughter was hungry, so I fed her. I tried to put off the movie, but eventually let her watch it. She was disappointed about her dad not showing up. I put her to bed at 9. \n\n11:30, my ex calls, freaking out. He said he forgot we were supposed to have dinner. He only remembered because his girlfriend came home from work and asked how everything went. Rather than apologizing, he got mad at me and asked why I didn\u2019t call him. I said I\u2019m not going to chase him down. I already spent 9 months doing that when I was pregnant, begging him to be in her life.  I\u2019m not going to do that now. It\u2019s up to him to make an effort and remember this stuff.\n\nWe had therapy the next day and she\u2019s on my side. However, my ex insists that I should\u2019ve called. I\u2019m frustrated that he hasn\u2019t tried to apologize to our daughter. \n\nMy mom said that I should\u2019ve called. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686336569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145deb5/aita_for_not_reminding_my_ex_he_was_supposed_to/", "score": 3839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In terms of him forgetting plans? From the information in your post I\u2019m going to say no. It was a one off thing, he might\u2019ve had a busy week and it slipped his mind. I\u2019m going to assume your daughter\u2019s happiness is your top priority and a simple text could\u2019ve avoided her being uspet before bed(I say this as a child of divorce) \n\nLike another comment said, a shared calendar would be a good solution for that and to hopefully avoid this from happening again", "NTA because your ex is responsible for his own behavior, but are you really saying you didn't even send a \"Are you coming?\" text?  You are not responsible for him, but you can act like an adult as well and communicate when something happens that you didn't expect like him not showing up to see his child.

It\u2019s nice to get advice from someone who has been in my daughter\u2019s shoes.", "I didn\u2019t.

My dad was the same way. I\u2019m not sure what the specifics of your situation are, but whenever my dad would cancel last minute I would get really upset because I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d. \n\nYears later (now as an adult) he told me that his last minute cancellations were because he was working overtime. After the divorce he lived on his own and had to pick up jobs to support himself and to be able to afford to take me to the zoo, the aquarium, the amusement park all the \u201cfun days\u201d with dad. \n\nIn my case, simple communication with my mother would have probably avoided me being upset. It\u2019s all about finding communication ways that work for you guys, it\u2019s all a learning process.\n\nAll the best to you guys!", "Yes.  I still think you are NTA, but this would have covered that one issue that you could have been better at.", "I don't think it was in any way your responsibility to follow up with him.  \n\nHe's a grown ass man, if he can't remember he has plans with his daughter then that's totally on him and shows he's not taking his responsibilities as a father seriously.", "His cancellations are not work. They\u2019re due to finding other plans. Like, his girlfriend wants to do something. It\u2019s why we\u2019re in therapy right now. He\u2019s learning that he can\u2019t make promises and not follow through. It\u2019s an asshole move to do period, but especially to a little girl who is still learning to trust her dad.

I doubt very much your Ex doesn\u2019t have a smartphone. You are already having the reminder why he\u2019s not a great guy, and unfortunately, now your daughter is too. \n\nI think you should hold off on arranging the shared custody if you can.

And if he made an honest mistake, it happens - but take responsibility for your error, dude. He\u2019s not a victim of his own actions.", "NTA, ask him when you got appointed as his secretary without your knowledge or consent?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t tell my daughter in advance of plans with him just to protect her from more disappointment. He seems too unreliable and not accountable for his actions.", "NTA but why are you trying to give this guy some custody?

So hard.\n\nYou don't owe him anything besides the common courtesy you'd offer to any living breathing human being.\n\nThat courtesy here is a text at 06:10 \"you okay/plans change?\"\n\nHe's an absolute cock for forgetting dinner/move night with his daughter don't get me wrong, but yeah.

Nah. Obviously not.", "NTA because he should be adult enough to remember- particularly remembering things that are important to his child. \n\nBut, if this is important to your child, and she is disappointed by him forgetting, then you should chase him in these situations.

Should you have called? I actually don\u2019t think so. Like you said, he needs to make this a priority and remember it. You\u2019re not his planner or alarm. \n\nTo be absent for 7 years, he really needs to be on it now if he really wants to be in her life. Remembering an event with his daughter is the bare minimum. I mean, let\u2019s be fucking for real. His girlfriend even remembered and she didn\u2019t even make the plans!", "I forget things all the time. That's why I set reminders in triplicate so that I don't. He's a grown man that can do the same. NTA.", "NTA. He needs to take responsibility for his own schedule.

If you give in, then you\u2019ll always have to give reminder calls. Then he\u2019ll be mad that you didn\u2019t call earlier, or you called too early and he forgot again.

You should have called? What, he shouldn\u2019t have set a reminder, put it in his diary, written it on the fridge, sent himself an email, put a note on his kitchen counter, or any other method of remembering???   \n\nThis is on him, 1000%. You should have called and asked *him* to keep *his* promise to *his* child? No. He presumably remembers to go to work, or meet other commitments without needing to be reminded.", "NTA as far as I can see you've gone above and beyond to include him - it's his responsibility to remember things.", "I would say that for the sake of your child you should have called, as a young boy i remember how i felt when i was ready to get out but was forgotten by the human who was coming to pick me up.", "NTA. Not your job to keep his schedule. It may have been nice for your daughter if you had called him when he was 30 minutes late, so he could have salvaged some of the evening.

I was more seeing it as a justification than an explanation, but that was my own lense.  Thanks for explaining.  I will remember this when my kid is older and if I have a partner.", "NTA. You're not responsible for reminding him about dinner with his daughter, nor should you be. He should keep track of this stuff himself, he can't rely on you (his ex) to remind him every time something is happening with his daughter. It really shows just how much he wants to be involved in his daughters life.", "Could you have reminded him, sure, but it is not your responsibility. Instead of wanting to apologize to your daughter, he got mad at you, deflecting responsibility for his lack of action. It's also been only 4 months of him being in your daughters life. NTA", "NTA\n\n\nThis guy has some fucking nerve expecting you to be his mommy/personal assistant when he fucked you both over for years. Who does he think has been giving *you* reminders to be a parent for the last 7 years? Does he not know how to use a Google calendar or the alarm on his phone?? How *on earth* is he blaming it on you *when even his freaking girlfriend remembered*?? Why not get *her* to be his personal assistant? \n\n\nThis guy is something else. Do **not** give him an inch on this or he will *absolutely* take a mile.\n\n\n{fuck. I'm furious for you}", "Is he disabled in some way? Can't use a calendar? Serious ADHD? Reminding people of their promises and obligations can be an act of kindness (though not always appreciated), but it's rarely an obligation.  If he wants reminders, he should have a good reason and ask politely.\n\nHe absolutely does owe your daughter an apology. \n\nBy \"custody\" above, you mean visitation, correct?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "So the 7(f) can remember but the 28(M) cannot? Ridiculous", "NTA and ignore everyone who says differently.  He should have set alarms and apologized.   \n\nIt's really important to hold him accountable because your daughter is learning how to be treated in her relationships.   Please teach her well.  You both deserve better.", "He's an adult and should be responsible for meeting his own priorities. Why should it be your responsibility? NTA", "NTA, he should have 5 notifications of it on his phone, written down on the calendar and a sticky on the fridge", "Nope, he\u2019s an adult.", "NTA\n\nI share custody with my ex and have the kiddos 3 days a week I set myself multiple alarms on my phone so that even if something pops up I have time to make sure in there before the agreed time", "NTA and everyone (even him) knows it. However\u2026 what\u2019s your Mom\u2019s deal?  Was she like your Dad\u2019s time keeper or something?", "NTA, you are not his responsibility.  He's a grown man who can't remember his own daughter.  Pathetic, keep records of this, and every other times he's missed and how many times he's never called.  Don't let anyone tell you that you should've called him.", "NTA!!! It's his responsibility to remember the visitation schedule and he's showing where his priorities truly lie. If he really wants to see his child, he would remember the schedule and try as much as possible, maybe even try visiting on other days as well.", "When did you become mother of your ex? NTA. Big boy adult can manage his own calendar.", "NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE, NTA!\n\nHe fucked off for 7 years and has just now decided he wants to be a father, it\u2019s up to HIM to get his shit together and keep track of his responsibilities! You\u2019re not his mommy and it\u2019s not your job to track his lazy ass down. I hope the therapist is recommending he apologize to your daughter because that is bullshit for him to spin it and blame you.", "Totally NTA. \n\nYou had no obligation to call. If you wanted to, you could have called and said \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to be here, I\u2019m only calling because I don\u2019t want to see her disappointed again. This is the one and only time I will remind you. Set your calendar.\u201d\n\nEven that, not obligated.", "You know you're not the asshole and he knows it too. He's mad he got caught being a deadbeat. I wouldn't be surprised if his girlfriend quickly caught on to this and left him (if she has any sense).\n\nNTA", "NTA....why can't he use the calendar on his phone to remind him of these things? Are his hands painted on? Anyway, not your responsibility to \"nag\" him to remember like a good little wifey.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult. He shouldn\u2019t be relegating his calendar to you. That\u2019s his job. Yeesh", "Ever person who \"forgets\" walks around with a computer in their pocket, complete with a calendar built right in.", "I have a horrible horrible memory for stuff like that. So years ago. Before the smart phone thing. Like in the 80s in high school. I learned how to use\n\nA calendar \n\nThey are great.\nAnd now I can even have a digital one that reminds me of stuff. And i can send myself timed texts to really remind me. At no point should this job fall on some ex of mine. Especially if its to spend time with my child.", "It\u2019s crazy how we all have this little device in our pockets that tells us the time and date. We can even set alarms and reminders and calendar events. \n\nNTA", "NTA. grown ass man.", "NTA but why are you working with him to get him custody after only four months in your daughter\u2019s life?\n\nI hope this incident is a wake up call that he needs to spend a lot more time proving his commitment to her and ability to be a present and responsible father before you aid him in this.", "NTA\nwhat a clown your ex is.", "NTA - As someone with severe out of sight out of mind issues, I know that it is my own responsibility to use my damn calendar app and set reminders.\n\nYou also wouldn't be the asshole for telling him to do this.", "NTA If he has a phone he can add it to his calendar and set an alarm.", "You know what really sucks? People forget everything. Especially ones deep in the grind. My dentist always asks his assistant to write what he said to me so I won\u2019t forget. Why? Because sometimes doing the shit you have to do to keep your family healthy and safe is the most soul sucking shit ever. Sometimes it\u2019s autopilot till the weekend during bad weeks.", "I agree NTA\n\nBUT\u2026 OP mentions that she genuinely believes he wants to be around and is trying. A text that says \u2018hey are you coming?\u2019 Takes a couple seconds to type and would spare her daughter\u2019s feelings. Don\u2019t make a habit of it though.", "I can't believe I had to scroll so long to find this. I wholeheartedly agree. You could've done your daughter a solid here, and I'm sure if you took the time to tell your ex this was the last time you'd be reminding him, it would stick. I feel sorry for the daughter who seems to be the real loser in all of this. ESH.", "I expect that his sudden interest in being a dad after years of not caring was prompted by this girlfriend.  That\u2019s not to say it couldn\u2019t still be genuine on his part; sometimes we need a new perspective to make us realize what we\u2019ve been ignoring. I hope for the kid\u2019s sake it is, though the forgetfulness isn\u2019t a great sign.", "His girlfriend is probably the reason he decided to come back around.", "[removed]", "No.  Don't do that.  Why should YOU have to do that FOR HIM when HE could have put it in his calendar on his phone?   No.  That's just enabling, and reinforcing to him that you're going to take care of everything. \n\nNo no no.  He can figure this out.", "Literally the only redeeming part of this whole thing for your ex, then.", "Wanna bet he's told her some version of \"my cruel crazy ex took custody of her and doesn't even let me visit?\" And then she helped him get in contact and ask for visitation so now he's stuck lol", "Presumably, because he still wants to get naked with her", "He sounds like a great dad.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That's what she's avoiding.", "I got my DH a cell phone  & showed him where the calendar was on it (I'm the tech in the family) & then said won't be keeping track of your families dates & birthdays, (& no I didn't put any dates in it for him).
