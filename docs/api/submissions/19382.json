My ex (28M) wasn\u2019t involved in her life by his own choosing. Back in December, he reached out. It took some time, talking and a little therapy. He\u2019s been back in  our daughter\u2019s life for about 4 months now. We are working with the courts to establish paternity and for him to get custody. In the meantime, I\u2019ve let him visit her at my place. He\u2019s taken her on day trips. Since getting a bigger apartment, he\u2019s had her spend the night.\n\nHe was supposed to visit her Wednesday, have dinner with us and watch a movie. We try to do things the three of us, per the therapist\u2019s recommendation so she can see us get along. My ex said he\u2019d be over around 6:00.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up. By 6:30, my daughter was hungry, so I fed her. I tried to put off the movie, but eventually let her watch it. She was disappointed about her dad not showing up. I put her to bed at 9. \n\n11:30, my ex calls, freaking out. He said he forgot we were supposed to have dinner. He only remembered because his girlfriend came home from work and asked how everything went. Rather than apologizing, he got mad at me and asked why I didn\u2019t call him. I said I\u2019m not going to chase him down. I already spent 9 months doing that when I was pregnant, begging him to be in her life.  I\u2019m not going to do that now. It\u2019s up to him to make an effort and remember this stuff.\n\nWe had therapy the next day and she\u2019s on my side. However, my ex insists that I should\u2019ve called. I\u2019m frustrated that he hasn\u2019t tried to apologize to our daughter. \n\nMy mom said that I should\u2019ve called. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686336569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145deb5/aita_for_not_reminding_my_ex_he_was_supposed_to/", "score": 648, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. Because she\u2019s important to you. NTA.", "NTA, but I would've called for your daughter's sake.", "NTA.

In terms of him forgetting plans? From the information in your post I\u2019m going to say no. It was a one off thing, he might\u2019ve had a busy week and it slipped his mind. I\u2019m going to assume your daughter\u2019s happiness is your top priority and a simple text could\u2019ve avoided her being uspet before bed(I say this as a child of divorce) \n\nLike another comment said, a shared calendar would be a good solution for that and to hopefully avoid this from happening again", "NTA because your ex is responsible for his own behavior, but are you really saying you didn't even send a \"Are you coming?\" text?  You are not responsible for him, but you can act like an adult as well and communicate when something happens that you didn't expect like him not showing up to see his child.

It\u2019s nice to get advice from someone who has been in my daughter\u2019s shoes.", "I didn\u2019t.

My dad was the same way. I\u2019m not sure what the specifics of your situation are, but whenever my dad would cancel last minute I would get really upset because I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d. \n\nYears later (now as an adult) he told me that his last minute cancellations were because he was working overtime. After the divorce he lived on his own and had to pick up jobs to support himself and to be able to afford to take me to the zoo, the aquarium, the amusement park all the \u201cfun days\u201d with dad. \n\nIn my case, simple communication with my mother would have probably avoided me being upset. It\u2019s all about finding communication ways that work for you guys, it\u2019s all a learning process.\n\nAll the best to you guys!", "Yes.  I still think you are NTA, but this would have covered that one issue that you could have been better at.", "I don't think it was in any way your responsibility to follow up with him.  \n\nHe's a grown ass man, if he can't remember he has plans with his daughter then that's totally on him and shows he's not taking his responsibilities as a father seriously.", "His cancellations are not work. They\u2019re due to finding other plans. Like, his girlfriend wants to do something. It\u2019s why we\u2019re in therapy right now. He\u2019s learning that he can\u2019t make promises and not follow through. It\u2019s an asshole move to do period, but especially to a little girl who is still learning to trust her dad. If they were for work, I wouldn\u2019t be upset.", "my ex used to do that. it finally got to a point where she didn't want to go with him when he did show up.\n\nNTA he needs to grow up and be responsible, especially if he is talking about custody.

His gf, a person almost wholly unconnected with you, was able to remember he was supposed to spend time with your daughter today. You are not his mother, nor his timekeeper, and definitely not his daily planner. Amazingly\u2026we all walk around with a device that can do that FOR us in our pockets and purses. I doubt very much your Ex doesn\u2019t have a smartphone. You are already having the reminder why he\u2019s not a great guy, and unfortunately, now your daughter is too. \n\nI think you should hold off on arranging the shared custody if you can.

And if he made an honest mistake, it happens - but take responsibility for your error, dude. He\u2019s not a victim of his own actions.", "NTA, ask him when you got appointed as his secretary without your knowledge or consent?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t tell my daughter in advance of plans with him just to protect her from more disappointment. He seems too unreliable and not accountable for his actions.", "NTA but why are you trying to give this guy some custody?

So hard.\n\nYou don't owe him anything besides the common courtesy you'd offer to any living breathing human being.\n\nThat courtesy here is a text at 06:10 \"you okay/plans change?\"\n\nHe's an absolute cock for forgetting dinner/move night with his daughter don't get me wrong, but yeah.

Nah. Obviously not.", "NTA because he should be adult enough to remember- particularly remembering things that are important to his child. \n\nBut, if this is important to your child, and she is disappointed by him forgetting, then you should chase him in these situations.

Should you have called? I actually don\u2019t think so. Like you said, he needs to make this a priority and remember it. You\u2019re not his planner or alarm. \n\nTo be absent for 7 years, he really needs to be on it now if he really wants to be in her life. Remembering an event with his daughter is the bare minimum. I mean, let\u2019s be fucking for real. His girlfriend even remembered and she didn\u2019t even make the plans!", "I forget things all the time. That's why I set reminders in triplicate so that I don't. He's a grown man that can do the same. NTA.", "NTA. He needs to take responsibility for his own schedule.

If you give in, then you\u2019ll always have to give reminder calls. Then he\u2019ll be mad that you didn\u2019t call earlier, or you called too early and he forgot again.

You should have called? What, he shouldn\u2019t have set a reminder, put it in his diary, written it on the fridge, sent himself an email, put a note on his kitchen counter, or any other method of remembering???   \n\nThis is on him, 1000%. You should have called and asked *him* to keep *his* promise to *his* child? No. He presumably remembers to go to work, or meet other commitments without needing to be reminded.", "NTA as far as I can see you've gone above and beyond to include him - it's his responsibility to remember things.", "I would say that for the sake of your child you should have called, as a young boy i remember how i felt when i was ready to get out but was forgotten by the human who was coming to pick me up.", "NTA. Not your job to keep his schedule. It may have been nice for your daughter if you had called him when he was 30 minutes late, so he could have salvaged some of the evening.

I would not be in favor of that or promoting it and I would document all cases that he forgets his responsibilities and promises.", "NTA Your mom is an AH and totally WRONG.  He is the AH for not remembering to see his daughter.  You did nothing wrong.  In the future I would not share anything with your mom regarding him.", "NTA 100% It sucks he forgot but he needs to get over himself and apologize. Him being upset with you and not apologizing shows that he still isn't prioritizing his daughter. He is probably embarrassed and so he is acting like a child.", "NTA.  You are Not his secretary.", "At your next therapy appointment, point out to him that he can set an alarm on his phone and remind himself.  NTA", "NTA, at all. \n\nAlthough I'm a little surprised you wouldn't have called by 6:45 or so, if only to give him shit for being late lol", "Nta. I have adhd and forget even my children\u2019s bdays. Not their days of birth but the days of the week we are on. I have to set them on my phone calendar and set alarm reminders to alert me ahead of time to send them their gifts and call them on their special days. It is possible to use your phone for alerts and reminders. I\u2019d politely suggest this to him one time and then leave it up to him from now on.", "NTA, but I think calling would have been a good idea, at least for OP's daughter's sake, and because the rest of OP's post indicates that the father has otherwise, at least this time, made an effort. \n\nNot saying that it's OP's responsibility, but mistakes happen", "He's the one that wants to be in your daughter's life, he needs to put in the effort.\n\nNTA", "ESH your ex 100% is the  biggest ahole, but you are an adult, too. Had you had plans with a friend and they didn\u2019t show up, would you have called?", "NTA. And I'll get down voted for this. But in a situation like this, you aren't punishing your ex. You're punishing your daughter. \n\nAccept the fact that he's a deadbeat loser that you will have to treat like a child, or just cut him out completely. \n\nThis half in half out crap where he disappoints her will do more harm than good. \n\nYou can be right and wrong at the same time. Think of your daughter first. Not who is siding with who in therapy.", "Nta you did not have to call, but you could have, not for him, but for your daughter. While you were proving your point, she was the one who got hurt.", "NTA- this is his responsibility to step up and take control of his life. If this were important to him he would have made sure to have set a reminder, and gotten there on time.  Why does he need you to prompt him to step up to his own responsibilities?  This is a challenge for him to overcome, not you.  You are not at all in any way responsible for or indebted to him for anything.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult. If anything, if it were to happen again, maybe have your daughter call & ask where he is/ if he\u2019s still coming over (if she questions where he is). That way he gets a reminder from her.", "NTA\n\nHe is allegedly a grown-ass man, and you are his ex, not his mother. If he truly wants to be a part of your daughter's life now, then it's up to HIM to make the effort and take whatever precautions to ensure that it can happen.", "Your mom is wrong. He\u2019s not your child. \n\nNTA.", "ESH\n\nSeeing her father was important to your daughter, and you did nothing to feed that importance, making you the AH. and your ex is an AH for forgetting.", "YTA think about your child not yourself", "Bring on the downvotes, but I think YTA, at least kind of. The loser here wasn\u2019t your ex, it was your daughter.  I get that you\u2019re fed up enabling his ass but ne t time you have a chance to prevent your kid from feeling worthless, take it.", "Yes", "Yeah after 7 years of no contact I wouldn\u2019t have even let him back in. Don\u2019t set your daughter up for a lifetime of disappointment. NTA", "Interesting that the ex's girlfriend remembered and he didn't.", "Yep, 'cause you know that girlfriend is the only reason he's doing this anyway....", "Any Recommendations for the shared calendar app?", "Yup, he most likely has a cellphone with a calendar to set up reminders. Even if he didn't, there's still good old-fashioned paper calendars to write things down on. I still use one in addition to my phone. Technology isn't always reliable.", "Wasn\u2019t for his girlfriend. She\u2019s not thrilled with this situation.", "but he\u2019s not \u201canyone else\u201d. he isn\u2019t her friend, her brother, father, etc\u2026 he\u2019s a deadbeat dad who abandoned his kid for the first 7 years of her life. you can\u2019t just completely change the scenario and act like it\u2019s the same. it\u2019s 100% his responsibility to show up when he said he would. this is HIS TIME to show he wants to make up for everything and to prove that he can be a competent dad and he doesn\u2019t even care enough to stick to plans (because according to OP he\u2019s canceled last minute multiple times) or to remember them. that\u2019s like the bare minimum of sharing a child with someone. at a certain point his hand should not be held anymore - he should step up and be an actual father on his own.", "We don\u2019t speak outside if she\u2019s there when I drop my kid off at their apartment.", "He needs to build trust with you and put in effort.", "Ehhh OP said the dude has a repeated pattern of finding \u201cbetter plans\u201d and cancelling last minute anyway. If someone keeps doing the same thing again and again it does in fact get tiring to shoulder the brunt of the work to maintain a relationship between two others. \n\n\nAnd honestly if that\u2019s a pattern you kinda just stop reaching out to ask because you\u2019ll assume it\u2019s the same situation as last time: he\u2019s blowing them off again instead of simply forgetting.", "it is not her responsibility to chase down her deadbeat ex and remind him that their child is a person with feelings. he's 28, and she's not his babysitter", "She has been. For the past seven years. When she was rasing the child. Alone.", "Why?", "I\u2019ve let him because if he is trying to work on himself (which I do genuinely believe) the alternative is in 20 years, she\u2019ll hate me for keeping them apart.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t going to do the work, he\u2019ll dig his own hole.", "Wants women to do all the emotional work of remembering and reminding. Your mom was taught to carry that load and she can learn that \"no, it is not healthy for any of us if men don't learn to remember on their own.\"\n\nNTA.", "Why isn't he mad at his girlfriend for not reminding him?", "wonder if she's the reason he even bother to reach out in the first place. maybe found out he had a daughter and basically told him he needed to step up as a parent or something? I mean, he clearly didn't make this choice on his own, otherwise he wouldn't be forgetting the dates he was supposed to be seeing her.", "I bet the girlfriend is the main reason he started trying to connect with his kid", "That was my thought too...", "[removed]", "Im guessing shes the one who got him to get back in her life.", "Right?! He's such an AH.", "As someone who forgets a lot and uses a calendar app to remember. Don't take the effort of making and filling the calendar for him. Tell him about it and let him use it. Otherwise you will have to do all the work and will still be blamed if something is missed.", "Google calender will notify you when you have upcoming appointments and even bills. I like it.", "Good to know it's all him. His actions should reflect that. If he makes a promise to his daughter, he sees it through. If he's the forgetful sort, then he adds it to his calendar. If something comes up, he communicates with you so you don't wait around.\n\nYou're not the a-hole. He is. You have gone out of your way to facilitate a relationship between your daughter and him. He should be grateful for your efforts and not lashing out at you for his mistakes.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to send any sort of text. At all. My oldest daughters dad is out of her life, but for a bit he would do something like this. He mentioned to me only once about me reminding him. I shut that crap down. I got all the responsibility of raising her and he only needed to remember to show up once and a while. Nope. He\u2019s a grown ass man.", "yeah, it would\u2019ve taken 2 seconds. but it also would\u2019ve taken him 2 seconds to set a reminder, put it on his calendar, leave a note on the fridge reminding himself\u2026 he\u2019s supposed to be using this time to show that he\u2019s able to step up as a dad. he can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re the one who has to remind him of plans. he\u2019s going to have to get used to doing that himself if he wants split custody.", "Which will only hurt your daughter more. It\u2019s your job to protect her. She may be mad but it\u2019s going to cause more hurt to have her disappointed and feeling like she\u2019s not good enough because her dad didn\u2019t love her enough to want to be in her life. I hope that this was a one off incident and he is consistent in her life. I know how hard this is. My children\u2019s father left when my youngest was 2 months was gone for 3 years got a new girlfriend and tried to come back in their life stayed for a year then left again after him and the girlfriend broke up. He\u2019s now been gone for 2 years and that door is shut. My kids were hurt and disappointed and they are finally getting back to themselves.", "NTA    Of course you should still be responsible for all the mental load\u2026including after you are divorced!   wtf  boo mom.  His daughter will come to know him all his pluses and minuses, no need for you yo bear the burden of giving her a completely bad example of women being responsible for the behavior of every man in the area.", "I am married. And it takes everything in me to not take on this role for my husband. \n\nMy husband is generally good with dates and stuff like this but he's not a hardcore planner like me. He's never asked me to keep of track of things for him but I've been so bombarded with images of a \"good wife\" that I can feel like it's my responsibility. \n\nI feel like I have to constantly remind myself he's an adult and he can handle his own business. He does not need me to be his secretary. \n\nIt's very hard to unlearn.", "Ugh thank you, this so much. Just another classic example of women carrying all the burden while men expect instructions.", "Lord, give me a sign!\n\n\"Why do I have to do all the work?\"", "Yeah sounds like my grandpa who only remembered we existed when he had a girlfriend who was family oriented and he could be like \u201cme, too! Here\u2019s my family!\u201d", "My ex used to do that every time he got a new girlfriend.
