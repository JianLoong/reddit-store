My ex (28M) wasn\u2019t involved in her life by his own choosing. Back in December, he reached out. It took some time, talking and a little therapy. He\u2019s been back in  our daughter\u2019s life for about 4 months now. We are working with the courts to establish paternity and for him to get custody. In the meantime, I\u2019ve let him visit her at my place. He\u2019s taken her on day trips. Since getting a bigger apartment, he\u2019s had her spend the night.\n\nHe was supposed to visit her Wednesday, have dinner with us and watch a movie. We try to do things the three of us, per the therapist\u2019s recommendation so she can see us get along. My ex said he\u2019d be over around 6:00.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up. By 6:30, my daughter was hungry, so I fed her. I tried to put off the movie, but eventually let her watch it. She was disappointed about her dad not showing up. I put her to bed at 9. \n\n11:30, my ex calls, freaking out. He said he forgot we were supposed to have dinner. He only remembered because his girlfriend came home from work and asked how everything went. Rather than apologizing, he got mad at me and asked why I didn\u2019t call him. I said I\u2019m not going to chase him down. I already spent 9 months doing that when I was pregnant, begging him to be in her life.  I\u2019m not going to do that now. It\u2019s up to him to make an effort and remember this stuff.\n\nWe had therapy the next day and she\u2019s on my side. However, my ex insists that I should\u2019ve called. I\u2019m frustrated that he hasn\u2019t tried to apologize to our daughter. \n\nMy mom said that I should\u2019ve called. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686336569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145deb5/aita_for_not_reminding_my_ex_he_was_supposed_to/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this day and age, people can put reminders in their phone for that.", "NTA. Never hunt someone down to make an effort for your kids. He either wants to be involved or he doesn\u2019t.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult. It is not your responsibility to send him a reminder to see his child.", "Listen to your therapist.", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn't care enough to remember to go see his own daughter, that's on him.  You're not his secretary and it just goes to show that he doesn't really give a shit anyways.", "NTA. You are parent to a girl, not parent to a girl and her father. He should remember his promises and appointments", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult, presumably with a phone to add in reminders and important dates. It\u2019s not up to you to carry his mental load as a parent, especially since you\u2019ve been doing that by yourself for 7 years already.

As a 28 year old adult, he should take responsibility for himself and his time. \n\nOne thought - maybe set up a shared calendar so when you have activities that are planned, it can go on the shared calendar. Not that you have to by any means, but just a thought to keep track for you and to eliminate any \"I forgot\" excuses from him.", "NTA. It\u2019s probably one of the exact reasons he is an ex-husband, I would suspect. He is responsible for his choices and his actions. He has clearly lost any right to blame his behaviour on you. Especially when he could probably have picked a fight over the phone and made you sound like the bad guy by yelling in front of your daughter. I\u2019ve just known far, far too many like him.", "NTA - It is his sole responsibility to follow through on priorities. He is not a child yet his statement suggests he is immature and slow to take personal responsibility. Best to you.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown ass man with a phone. Tell him to learn how to use the calendar app.", "NTA.   You are not his mother or his personal assistant.  If your mom wants to step into that roll, encourage her to have him share his calendar with him so SHE can call and remind him of his appointment to see his daughter.     \n\n\nYou know the most glaringly obvious part of this that shows he's the asshole?  His girlfriend asked him how it went.  His girlfriend remembered he was supposed to spend the evening with his daughter, but he didn't.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not his Personal Assistant. If he wants back in his daughters life it's on him to make sure that happens. He's the one who walked away and now wants back.

Is he genuinely interested in a relationship with your daughter or did he only initiate it because she pushed him to, or he wanted to impress her? It does sound like she's the driving force behind his wanting to be a dad now. I mean he only called you when she came home and asked how everything went.

I get the vibe his gf inadvertently found out he has a kid that he\u2019s been a deadbeat to for 7 years which is why he\u2019s suddenly playing up the caring father act. If he can\u2019t even remember to put a calendar reminder in his phone that\u2019s his own fault and shows how little he cares.", "Would you forget your daughter? No. Because she\u2019s important to you. NTA.", "NTA, but I would've called for your daughter's sake.", "NTA. You probably could've texted to ask is he's still coming, but he's an adult and responsible for his schedule. Would you trust him to pick your child up from school? He needs to not just show up when it's convenient, but prove he can handle the responsibility of raising a child.", "ehhhh ESH. \n\nHe sucks for getting mad at you for not reminding him but on the other hand it takes two seconds to send a little reminder text like \u201chey just a reminder,movie night tonight.\u201d \n\nIs this a reoccurring pattern? In terms of him forgetting plans? From the information in your post I\u2019m going to say no. It was a one off thing, he might\u2019ve had a busy week and it slipped his mind. I\u2019m going to assume your daughter\u2019s happiness is your top priority and a simple text could\u2019ve avoided her being uspet before bed(I say this as a child of divorce) \n\nLike another comment said, a shared calendar would be a good solution for that and to hopefully avoid this from happening again", "NTA because your ex is responsible for his own behavior, but are you really saying you didn't even send a \"Are you coming?\" text?  You are not responsible for him, but you can act like an adult as well and communicate when something happens that you didn't expect like him not showing up to see his child.  You could even do the passive/aggressive \"Are you OK?\" text if you wanted to.", "That\u2019s a good idea, actually.", "They\u2019ve been together 3 years. I do genuinely believe that he wants to be around, because she was hesitant about him coming back in her life but when he made it clear it was a dealbreaker, she got over it. She is definitely not the driving force. She\u2019s just marginally more responsible than he is.", "No, not even close. She wasn\u2019t on board with him being around at first.", "This isn\u2019t reoccurring where he\u2019ll forget and not say anything, but he has cancelled last minute before.\n\nI\u2019ll mention a shared calendar going forward. It\u2019s nice to get advice from someone who has been in my daughter\u2019s shoes.", "I didn\u2019t. I figured him not showing up was him blowing us off on purpose, as it aligns with his personality of finding \u201cbetter\u201d plans and not showing. Though he will text those times.\n\nBut you\u2019re right, it would\u2019ve taken 2 seconds to send a \u201c you alive\u201d?", "Thanks - I've learned from experience \ud83d\ude09", "Hmm in that case communication is the key here. My dad was the same way. I\u2019m not sure what the specifics of your situation are, but whenever my dad would cancel last minute I would get really upset because I didn\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d. \n\nYears later (now as an adult) he told me that his last minute cancellations were because he was working overtime. After the divorce he lived on his own and had to pick up jobs to support himself and to be able to afford to take me to the zoo, the aquarium, the amusement park all the \u201cfun days\u201d with dad. \n\nIn my case, simple communication with my mother would have probably avoided me being upset. It\u2019s all about finding communication ways that work for you guys, it\u2019s all a learning process.\n\nAll the best to you guys!", "Yes.  I still think you are NTA, but this would have covered that one issue that you could have been better at.", "I don't think it was in any way your responsibility to follow up with him.  \n\nHe's a grown ass man, if he can't remember he has plans with his daughter then that's totally on him and shows he's not taking his responsibilities as a father seriously.", "His cancellations are not work. They\u2019re due to finding other plans. Like, his girlfriend wants to do something. It\u2019s why we\u2019re in therapy right now. He\u2019s learning that he can\u2019t make promises and not follow through. It\u2019s an asshole move to do period, but especially to a little girl who is still learning to trust her dad. If they were for work, I wouldn\u2019t be upset.", "me ex used to do that. it finally got to a point where she didn't want to go with him when he did show up.\n\nNTA he needs to grow up and be responsible, especially if he is talking about custody. Is he going to rely on you then, too?", "This is what I\u2019m afraid of. But I also think he\u2019ll have to dig his own hole. I won\u2019t keep her from him, but he\u2019ll either have to shape up or she\u2019ll realize who he is."]}
