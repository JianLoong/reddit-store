She retaliated to someone speaking horribly to her, but she may as well take the high road and just apologise to keep the peace.", "I feel that when we respond in kind we validate that attitude, in the sense that commenting on someone's body is not acceptable, but OP has retorted the comment this way as well, so if an adult replies to the girl she will continue to think that talking that way is \"acceptable\", even if harmful, since she saw examples of adults who \"validated\" her mistake, I don't know if I was able to explain my idea well.\n\nI also don't think the world has an obligation to protect everyone's feelings, but in my perception, when someone attacks you, it's much more appropriate for you to communicate how it affected you than to try to affect the person in return, because at least you you know your part you've done. Now of course, I'm saying this without being in the situation, sometimes in the moment one doesn't think about any of these things.\n\nAnd as for an apology corroborating that she is right, I don't think so, I believe an apology will only further show how wrong she was, if OP knows how to communicate and says \"sorry for commenting on your body, in fact, that is not appropriate and I don't know your struggles, I did in the moment of hurt when YOU commented on my body, it's not because you perceive me in a way that you have the right to express that and comment on my body. I apologize because I know that I hurt you because I also felt attacked when you did it to me, maybe in the future you will remember how you felt before talking about other people's bodies, your pain is not more valid than mine\".", "OP you were polite. You explained why the 15 year old needed to wait. It's not your fault the 15 felt entitled to extra cake. She didn't care if others went without. NTA", "Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Just because the 15 year old crossed a line, doesn\u2019t mean OP needed to stoop to their level.", "Tbh, all she said is that she probably wants to eat more because she's bigger which was a) true and b) is logical. I'm not chunky because I eat like a bird... I do be enjoying a larger portion sometimes. Girlie wanted more cake and she could have it, that wasn't the problem, the problem was being impatient, greedy and rude.\n\nWhat OP said was really quite tame, I wouldn't be bothered by it personally, and importantly it wasn't a disproportionate response.\n\nYou can't expect to be treated like some protected class when you insult people for the same trait you want to be protected for", "NTA, waiting until everyone gets a slice is polite. You did not fat shame this girl until AFTER she brought up your own weight.\n\nWhile not a perfect response, ultimately responding to body shaming is not an asshole move.\n\nIf you don't want people to comment on your body, don't comment on theirs.", "Nta, you didn't do anything wrong and I wouldn't apologize.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t actually fat shame her but you did take her bait and gave her an opening to play victim or to redirect attention.\n\nHer request and how you first reacted to it didn\u2019t have anything to do with weight. She was greedy and rude. You should have ignored any mention of weight.", "NTA. She has no manners.", "NTA. \n\nI'm fat. I'll admit that. Working to change it, but I am and have been for years. If someone gives me a portion I know won't satisfy me, I thank them, eat the portion, and wait to see if there was any leftovers for me to snag (with permission) instead of getting pissy with the person who handed me the plate. \n\nThe friends attitude was completely uncalled for and they were acting like a petulant, entitled child. You didn't tell them they couldn't have anymore cake, just that if they wanted more to wait a little bit until everyone in attendance could get some. They mentioned your weight first in a negative manner, fight fire with fire and mention theirs in a negative manner. You were as polite as can be, and have no reason to feel sorry.", "NTA. She was entitled and didn't even listened to you, she just went assuming that you were being discriminatory.", "YTA. Fat shaming is never ok.\n\nYou should have left it at, \"sure, I'm happy to give you more once everyone has been served\". \n\nDon't let ppl push your buttons. No matter how they try to bait you.", "OP is NTA, but I believe that you may be\u2026", "I\u2019m not condoning it\u2026? I\u2019m saying they were both wrong for commenting on the other\u2019s appearance in regards to body type and weight.", "They can still have an ED, you absolute donut.", "Thank you for proving my point. You can have an ED and still be greedy and entitled, the issue of the ED is entirely irrelevant in this scenario.", "NTA she brought both it up first it\u2019s fair game at that point.", "ESH, her for arguing with you when you gave her a reasonable response and making assumptions/commenting on your body, and you for commenting on her body. not saying it wasn\u2019t somewhat warranted but the ol \u201ceye for an eye\u201d and whatnot.", "NTA for your initial handling of the situation. \n\nYTA for lowering yourself to the level of a butthurt 15yo. She should know better than to be rude like she was being, but you DEFINITELY should know better. ESPECIALLY if you hate getting comments on your own body. You're not going to change the world for the better if you let it change you for the worse. \nAnd even if you're not trying to change the world, you are the adult in the situation. A lot of children and teenagers act stupid, it happens. You teach them to be better so they realise when they get older. I mean she's 15, who cares what dumb shit she said?", "Gen Z Moment. You definitely didn't say anything wrong before she insulted you, and you know what was kind of petty like you said but if she said something about your body then you should be able to say something about hers. I'd say fair fight.", "NTA. She started it, you finished it.", "Wait I'm confused.  You assumed that she WASNT going to eat all the cake.  She doesn't sound fat, she sounds greedy.", "ME WANT FOOD!\n\nNTA", "You did nothing wrong.  NTA", "Entitled brat who unironically uses word 'fatphobic' is clearly the a-hole", "Cause and effect are relevant here.", "This is kind of the reason I hate that humans are so nuanced and varied lol. I see your point; an appropriately delivered apology, if properly understood, could help in the 15 year old understand a better way to carry herself.\n\n However, with the brief characterization we have been given, I've gotta assume she'd take the apology wrong. She's not demanding the apology for her hurt feelings, but because she didn't get her way. If she's as aggressively stuck in the \"my way\" mentality as it looks to me, I'm not sure if it is possible to deliver the apology constructively. \n\nBut I'm also a lil jaded, so do take this with a few grains of salt.", "NTA - you don't go asking for seconds, until everyone has had the opportunity to at least have firsts.", "NTA.   And shame on her and everyone who says you should apologize.   She was rude and entitled\u2014- and then she decided to make a comment about your body.  Was your response immature? Sure.  But play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  You said what you needed to say in order to get her out of your face.  You shouldn\u2019t be expected to act like a customer service representative if you are not at work, in a job where you ARE a customer service representative.", "The other girl brought up OPs weight first. Skinny shaming should be a thing. Underweight people are ridiculed and they could suffer from all sorts of health issues.", "Yeah. But OP is 18 and can deal with a 15 year old calling her skinny. Calling a child fat because they called you skinny isn\u2019t very nice especially when you are an afult", "Unless she was called anorexic, it wasn\u2019t skinny shaming , to go to fat shaming  yeah big time ahole", "I agree with this - the 15 yo literally said \u201ci want 3 pieces for just me\u201d, and then proceeded to argue about it. \n\nAnd, this is coming from a GUEST at someone else\u2019s home.  I LOL\u2019d"]}
