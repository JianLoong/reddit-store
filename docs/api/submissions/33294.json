The world doesn\u2019t stop because they had a baby 16 years ago. You did what was best for your child- as they did for theirs", "NTA. People are wild. I doubt a 16 y/o was upset that you couldn't come. Continue doing you and taking care of your helpless child.", "NTA and you're being a good mom and good citizen, even if your family thinks you're not being a good aunt.", "Nta you absolutely should NOT take a 3month old to a restaurant.  Send the kid a nice check and bday card.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  I'm sure that those who said you don't care about your nephew would have occupied your child while you were eating.  It's so easy for people to say stupid things.", "NTA\n\nIf you had showed up with a fussy 12-week old, that would have been an AH thing to do. Yes, babies cry. Yes, babies get fussy. That's completely understandable. I have children (who not to long ago were little tiny babies), so I understand that sometimes, despite everything you do, they will cry anyway. \n\nBut when they were in a fussy or crying phase, I definitely did NOT take them to a birthday party, or any party. That's just common courtesy. I get really upset with parents whose babies start crying as soon as they sit down, and keep crying until the bill is paid. Maybe they've gone deaf at this point and don't notice it, but everyone else sure does. Take your baby outside, get your order to-go, I don't know, but do something. A minute or two of crying is one thing, but not a full meal's worthy of tears. \n\nSo thank you for not taking your child to a place that you knew would cause problems. \n\nAlso thank you for being responsible with your child's growing immune system.", "NTA. The people complaining don\u2019t care about you or your nephew. The wanted to see the baby and/or do the whole \u201cfamily\u201d thing. It\u2019s nuts to bring a tiny baby into a loud, busy germ-ridden place. You did the right thing for you and your child. Don\u2019t let their ignorant comments get to you. It\u2019s not \u201ccoddling\u201d to care gif your child\u2019s wellbeing and if they don\u2019t get that, put them on ignore.", "Nta. Your family is though. You protect your baby and yourself.", "INFO: Was the birthday boy offended that you and baby didn't show up? His opinion is the only one that actually matters in this situation. If your nephew is truly hurt by you missing the party offer to take him on a special make-up day.\n\nAlso, \"The world doesn't stop just because you have a baby\" applies for unavoidable situations that are made more difficult when you have a baby, like having a cold. Saying \"I don't want to bring my new baby to a family party at a crowded restaurant during cold and flu season\" isn't expecting the world to stop, it's being a decent parent. Tell your relatives to look up pictures and statistics of babies with RSV in your area, and tell them that they should be thankful you're taking precautions to keep your baby safe.\n\n99% NTA, judging without knowing how the actual birthday boy feels.", "NTA.
