{"id": 3559, "submission_id": "z8bxca", "title": "AITA for refusing to bring my newborn son to my in-laws\u2019 house?", "selftext": "I (f24) just gave birth to my son via emergency C section about 2 weeks ago. My S/O (m25) and I don\u2019t live together yet and he is now telling me that his parents and family want me to bring our son over to their house despite me being clear early on that they\u2019re more than welcome to visit him in my home (I still live with my parents). My reason for not wanting to go over is because they (my S/O, his parents and brother) smoke within the home. Not just in one room, but in every room of the household and it just plain reeks of cigarettes and pot. They don\u2019t ever bother to go outside or designate a room to smoke in, and they smoke very often within all parts of the home. This didn\u2019t bother me before since it\u2019s their house and their rules, but now they want me to bring my son into this environment for a visit, despite knowing that I didn\u2019t want to have my son be around that smell or any secondhand smoke. I\u2019ve put my foot down on the matter and said I\u2019m not comfortable with taking him there and risking his health especially since he\u2019s so young. My S/O is upset and saying he has a say as the father and this is his family asking to see the baby while he\u2019s still small so i should be making an effort to have our son visit his grandparents and aunts/uncles at least once before he\u2019s a month old. \nHe\u2019s not even taken into consideration that I\u2019m exhausted from sleepless nights of taking care of our son, or that I\u2019m still recovering from the surgery and dealing with postpartum depression. He thinks that one or two hours of a visit isn\u2019t that big of a deal and i should just make the effort to not risk making his parents upset or burning any bridges. I\u2019ve tried having this conversation with him multiple times to have him realize how uncomfortable it\u2019s making me and that i don\u2019t think i should have to cater to his parents wishes when my home is open to them at any time.\n\nAm I wrong here? Should i just suck it up and make the visit to appease everyone? Please give me honest thoughts, much appreciated.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify- when I was in the hospital, the in laws came to visit me and my son and during their brief stay i told them they are more than welcome to come to my house once we\u2019re discharged to visit. Additionally, I FaceTime my S/O nightly and have invited over his parents multiple times on the phone, as well as texted his mother pictures along with more open invites to come visit her grandson here at my home. It\u2019s been made abundantly clear to them that they and their children are welcome to come see the baby (despite my endless fatigue and lack of social battery)", "created_utc": 1669769262, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8bxca/aita_for_refusing_to_bring_my_newborn_son_to_my/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their indoor smoking habit is incredibly dangerous for your infant and they can keep that bullshit at their house. Do not buy into this 1-2 hour visit is important for the baby. You aren't even supposed to be carrying a diaper bag if it weighs more than your baby at this point after an emergency csection. Please, please, contact your OB, get help for the PPD and do not get pushed around. You know the right answer to this is no. Please don't compromise your health or your baby's for these assholes. Can your mom go Mama Bear on these turds? You need 1000% more care and nurturing to heal and look after the baby.", "NTA. If they really want to see the baby, they can come over to your place. And leave the cigarettes at home.", "NTA. You\u2019re recovering from major surgery, their home is unsuitable and you have invited them over. Hold your ground. Establishing boundaries with extended family when you have a new baby is very important. He is probably getting a lot of pressure from them.", "NTA. Your first priority is your child's heath. And your second priority is your health, because if you aren't healthy, you can't take care of priority 1. This *should* also be the priority of your partner, not making his parents happy (or worrying about burning bridges, or whatever).\n\nWhen your partner has had as many sleepless nights taking care of the child as you, then he can \"have a say as the father.\" A *true* father is someone who takes care of their child and isn't just a sperm donor.", "NTA. Second and Third hand smoke KILL people. And with a newborn with RSV season hitting *hard* you shouldn't have to justify yourself.

Let me guess OP he's also not around as much as he should be to help with HIS child? While he does have \"some say\" he doesn't get to order YOU around. They want to see kiddo so badly after you have had major surgery(feel free to find a c-section vid on yt, send it to him and then ask him why he thinks you should be hauling baby about just because HIS family is too damn selfish to put the smokes down for a couple of hours and wear NON smokey clothes) they can come to you\n\nAlso your baby is 2 weeks old. There is no \"bonding\" that needs to happen this urgently other than between you and your partner because to kiddo those are just gonna be sorta in focus blobs who don't smell like either parent\n\nALSO ALSO if his parents and other relatives aren't complete AHs - invite them directly. Let them know the obvious of no smoking right before or during the visit AND if they can swing it to please wear non smokey clothes. If they complain let them know they will just have to wait til kiddo is older. Don't get dragged into an argument about how they did it with their kids and how they turned fine blah blah.

They should feel really lucky you are willing to accept visitors period.

Talk to your pediatrician and if possible have them read your husband the riot act for such irresponsible plans.", "I didn\u2019t even have to read halfway through this.  NTA\n\nYou had a baby 2 weeks ago.  You don\u2019t have to go anywhere.  Keep that baby at your house and enforce the no smoking/second hand/third hand smoke rule", "As long as you tell them that you will not be bringing an infant to visit so long as ANYONE smokes inside that house, NTA. \n\nBut be sure to tell them why. They can come visit you, they can take all their smoking outside, but that ball is still in their court.", ">He thinks that one or two hours of a visit isn\u2019t that big of a deal  \n\n\nIf going over to someone's house for an hour or two is no big deal, then why TF aren't the people who want the visit and aren't caring for a newborn able to?

Keep your precious baby safe from their deadly habit.", "NTA....And please please please please don't bring that baby into the house even for 2 seconds. That smoke inside will do more harm than good for baby....tell him if they want a visit it needs to be somewhere neutral", "NTA. I think  in some states it\u2019s illegal to smoke in a room or in a car with a baby in it. \nAnd How cracked out do they have to be to argue about having a baby in their gross as cancer palace. \n\nIf they actually care about the child\u2019s well-being, they will come visit. \nIf they push the issue idk if I\u2019d even trust them around the baby.", "NTA, but if you try to live with him, he WILL be smoking around your baby and in your home. What do you intend to do in those regards?", "NTA. Tell him that you will only bring the baby over if they deep clean the house because his immune system isn't there yet and all the 2nd hand smoke is dangerous for him to be around. If they don't want to clean their house then they don't really want to see their grandson. They should also understand that you are still recovering and need your time and space to do so. Your S/O needs to stop being a hot sack of garbage and be more supportive and helpful to you", "NTA. They can come see the baby. If he presses, ask again who had the major surgery and that they can come by or wait until you recover.", "NTA and he\u2019d have zero luck convincing a third party that you need to drag your baby into a house full of smokers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
