It's a big passion of mine and something I love to do as a hobby in my free time. I have an Instagram account that I use to show off my work, which is mainly the cakes I bake and decorate. I make these cakes for family and friends for birthday's or specials occasions (Christmas, Easter etc). \n\nI never charge for these cakes, but am always compensated in some way by my family and friends. They'll usually gift me money or a gift card to my favorite restaurants, or make me a dish in return as a thank you. \n\nMy younger brother (23M) and his fianc\u00e9e (23F) were planning their wedding and asked me a few months in advance if I'd be able to make their cake for them? This would be my biggest order yet. They wanted a three layer cake (wedding was 75 people), in the flavor of strawberry shortcake as it's their favorite.\n\nI was hesitant at first but agreed to make the cake, under the condition that I was compensated for it. I explained to them that this was the biggest order I've never had, and was going to take up a lot of my time, labor and be costly. I gave them a VERY fair price for a cake of that caliber. They agreed. I also made it clear that I wanted to be paid before the wedding.\n\nI provided them multiple sketches of what the cake would look like. Made a practice batch of the actually cake so that they could sample, and they loved the cake and approved of everything. Fast forward to last week, 6 day's before the wedding. I contacted my brother for my payment as I was going to get started on buying the rest of the ingredients for the cake (minus the strawberries I was going to do that closer to the date so they could be fresh). \n\nHe insured me he'd drop off my cheque the next day. Next day came, brother went MIA and no cheque arrived, so I tried to contact him again. Next day came, no cheque again. I offered to drive to their house and pick up the cheque, they made an excuse that is didn't work with their schedules. \n\nSo the day before the wedding I contacted both my brother and his fianc\u00e9e asking again. They blew up on me telling me that I'm a selfish b\\*tch for charging them when I don't charge the rest of the family and that they refused to pay, but demanded me to make to cake. I said no, and explained my terms again.\n\n They called me a selfish AH and said I better make the damn cake. I again said no. So the day of the wedding I decided not to attend, due to the amount of disrespect they showed me. Well my brother, his fianc\u00e9e and her family are now BLOWING up my phone sending me all kinds of nasty messages. My family are trying to stay out of it, but don't think I should've screwed them like that. AITA for not making the cake after they refused to pay me?\n\nINFO: I was charging them $400.", "created_utc": 1673536295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a1xau/aita_for_not_making_my_brother_and_his_fianc\u00e9e_a/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were upfront about the charges and $400 for a 75 person wedding cake is pretty inexpensive. They AGREED to this and then tried to guilt you into doing it for free - AT THE LAST MINUTE. The fact that her family is piling on shows the familial level of entitlement going on there.\n\nThis is the type of thing that would cause me to go either LC or NC. It doesn't sound like you'd be missing out on much.", "NTA. All I read here is they're calling you a selfish AH because they have to pay for something that costs a lot of time and money.", "NTA\n\nNo money, no cake. \n\nEnd of story.", "NTA- I\u2019m so glad you stuck to your guns. In the future- require full payment at least 4 weeks before, no tasting or sketching till it\u2019s made (offer a refund if they don\u2019t like what you can offer). \n\nJust print out the texts, and mail them to all the family. Fuck them all", "NTA - It doesn't matter that you usually don't charge or whether the amount you were charging was reasonable. They agreed to pay for the cake and agreed to the price that you set. If they had a problem with it, they could have negotiated with you or gone elsewhere for their cake. Instead, they waited to pushback until the last minute hoping you would give in under pressure/risk of looking bad. \n\nSend variations of this message to anyone who is bothering you/asks about this:\n\n\"When \\[brother\\] and \\[SIL\\] approached me months ago about making their wedding cake I agreed to make it but told them that I would need to charge based on the size and complexity of what they were asking for. They said that they understood why I was charging and they agreed to the price that I set. Over the last few months I sent them sketches of the design for their approval and even made them a sample cake so that they could make sure they liked the flavor. Throughout this entire process they never once questioned my decision to charge them and confirmed that they would pay closer to the wedding. It was only in the days before the wedding that they told me they refused to pay. I felt this was disrespectful of my time and that they were attempting to manipulate me into making the cake for free. Not having a cake at their wedding was a consequence of their actions. They had months to look into other options if they were unwilling to pay me for my work.\"", "NTA\n\nAnd for a 25YO woman, you have a remarkably good ability to set and enforce a boundary and not be guilted into doing things.\n\nI think many people in your situation would have made the cake out of a sense of guilt and then just been resentful afterwards for being out all the time and money. Then they\u2019d be posting here wondering if they\u2019re the AH for being mad and asking for the money over and over after the fact. \n\nYour way or the other way, people would be mad. Because they\u2019re entitled users. You shut it down on the front end.\n\nWell done!", "100% NTA\n\nYou clearly stated your condition in advance and they agreed to pay you before the wedding.\n\nNo payment, no product, its that simple.", "NTA\n\n1. It\u2019s easy enough to rationalize that you depend on that money to be able to buy the necessary supplies\n2. It\u2019s an AH move on their part to agree to pay you and then backtrack and try to weasel out of it \n\nIt seems like they were trying pull a fast one and call your bluff. Like they fully expected you to still make the cake even though they had no intention of paying you. And shocked pikachu face when you stood your ground. \n\nThe only thing that isn\u2019t clear is whether you were up front that if you didn\u2019t get paid, you absolutely wouldn\u2019t make the cake. Not that it should need to be said as it\u2019s common sense. But they seem to be lacking in that department. \n\nThis is why doing favors and providing services to family is always a headache.", "NTA. there's a massive difference between baking for fun/small business and a wedding cake for 75 people. That's like seeing someone sketching in a notebook and demanding they paint you an 8 foot tall photo realistic oil portrait for free, \"because you haven't charged money in the past.\"", "NTA - you told them they needed to pay. They are trying to use you.", "NTA - you agreed a price with them, they tried to trick you into not paying it. If they didn't like the price they should have just said so rather than pulling that crap.", "NTA. They made an agreement with you, apparently having in mind that they would never pay up and then try to bully you into working for free.\n\nTherefore, they tried to steal from you. \n\nGood for you for standing your ground!", "NTA\n\nThey agreed on the price, which even seems appropriately discounted in regards to the cakes you give other family.", "NTA. You asked to be compensated, they agreed. They only have themselves to blame for not paying upfront.", "NTA, your terms were clear ahead of time.  I'm guessing they waited until the last minute to refuse to pay figuring you'd give in and make it anyway.  I'm behind you 100%.  I would also say your charge was very fair, I didn't pay much less than that for my wedding cake 20+ years ago.", "NTA these weren't funfetti cupcakes you were making. Wedding cakes are a whole different ballgame. Bro and sil need to get a clue. How selfish they are.", "NTA, you did the right thing, horrible entitled abusive behavior from them and her family, your family is wrong too, you didn't screw them they screwed themselves.", "Nope, NTA\n\nThey are entitled as hell demanding you make it free, and doubly AHs for waiting last minute and blowing up when you informed them from the start", "Absolutely not.\n\n\nNta they do not get a service like that for free just because your family. You told them in advance and 400 dollars for 3 layer cake is such a steal. \n\n\nGo no contact for awhile. They should be ashamed.", "They were planning on stiffing you the entire time. What a bunch of assholes.", "NTA  \n\n\nthe only reason they asked you was because they thought you could get it for free", "NTA - They are trying to have their cake and eat it....You agreed on compensation and they reneged. It's a fuck ton of effort and cost to make such a big cake and they are being entitled for thinking just because you do X for other people that they somehow deserve the same treatment when the two things don't even compare.", "NTA because the terms and conditions were set up with more than substantial time for them to figure out if that\u2019s what they wanted for their wedding or they were free to go to another baker/establishment and conduct their business elseware. \n\nThey should know that everyone who you have made cakes for in the past has given something back to you one way or another whether it was money or another item to show their appreciation. \n\nYou most definitely put in the time and effort to making this special cake for them - providing sketches/options, and timing the ingredient purchases to ensure perfection for them. Furthermore, when I got married 12.5 years ago my custom cake for 150 people was $300.  So to hear that today you are charging $400 for all of the time and effort and operational timing/planning you\u2019ve put into doing this is absolutely a VERY fair price!!!", "NTA, at a minimum they need to pay for all the ingredients it's not cheap that's a huge cake. And you've likely saved them from paying hundreds from a shop/company. Also they agreed to pay you and then behaved like that.", "But you can do it for exposure!!!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It kind of sounds like they intended to not pay right from the start and just figured OP would cave at the last minute. They should have communicated any reservations, outrage, or disappointment well in advance.  Textbook case of fuck around and find out.  They screwed themselves on this one.\n\nThe $400 OP was asking is essentially a token amount that might (might!) have covered the cost of ingredients and have enough left over to buy lunch. To say nothing of the time and effort involved that would go uncompensated.  They were not finding one for less unless they went to the grocery store pre-made section and did some culinary arts and crafts at home.\n\nIt's true that sometimes you sacrifice for friends and family, but this was a huge ask on which the other parry tried to break the agreement last minute and still get their way.  OP is NTA all day long.", "NTA. A 3 level wedding cake is a lot different a birthday cake or for a party. It causes a lot of added stress.", "NTA. They agreed to your terms and changed their minds, therefore you were off the hook.", "NTA. Your family does compensate you for the cakes just not necessarily with cash. A wedding cake is a big project and costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. I wouldn\u2019t expect my sibling to make me a huge cake for free. Good for you for standing your ground and not making the cake since they did not pay.", "NTA they clearly avoided you on purpose expecting you to carry on making the cake in the meantime.\n\nWedding cakes aren't cheap and at retail, even at cost, can be above an average wedding gift in value. Throw in your time aswell?\n\nHe thought he could shame you into giving them a free cake.", "NTA, and your \"friends and family\" rate should be 3-5X higher.", "NTA.\n\nYou came to an agreement well in advance and they tried to get out of it when it was go time.  Honestly, you should have just said no in the first place unless they were willing to give you a deposit on the order at the time they asked or within a week of that.  I'm sure a cake of that size wouldn't be cheap to get the ingredients for, and certainly requires a lot of detail work if it's going to be a wedding cake.\n\nI also notice that the cakes you make for other people seem to have been done of your own volition, were not 3 tier cakes, and that you did it because you wanted to rather than because you were actually asked to.\n\nThe AHs are the entitled couple who just got married thinking they could get a free intricate cake out of you after AGREEING to pay for it.", "NTA, no pay no cake. \n\nOnly thing I would\u2019ve done differently is get it in writing that you expect payment by X date for supplies, time, etc. and have them sign it. Then you have it to prove they agreed to the terms and it\u2019s their own fault for not paying you.", "NTA - these costs can add up. making a birthday cake and making a 3 tier wedding cake are two very different things. you communicated in advance and they agreed. you went above and beyond to try to make it happen. if they felt strongly that you shouldn't be charging them, they should have communicated that weeks beforehand, not waiting until the very last minute to tell you. i would make all these details very clear to the family so that they understand why things went down the way they did. \n\nmy brother offered to do my flowers for the wedding. i offered to pay for the flowers. he didn't do anything in advance to order the colors i wanted. i wanted a rusty red, he shows up the day before with peach (which i paid for) saying that they didn't have the rust color i wanted that day (he could have ordered them). he threw a tantrum and left all the roses scattered on my mom's front porch. i was pregnant and sitting up by myself at midnight the night before my wedding doing my own flowers (which i had to buy AGAIN). now that is an AH, not you.", "NTA. So many times on here, the OP hints at wanting to be compensated for something but doesn\u2019t actually verbalize it. You did & you made everything very clear. You let them know how much & when payment was expected. So for them to come back at the last minute telling you they\u2019re not going to pay is 100% on them.\n\nAnd for the family members being rude to you - I love what another commenter wrote for a response: \u201cyou\u2019re certainly welcome to make a free wedding cake for them!\u201d\n\nGood job in setting boundaries & sticking to them. And hopefully you can use that cake recipe & design in the future. It sounds amazing!", "Nta- GREAT JOB!!! You set amazing boundaries and handled this so well!!! You will probably get a ton of flak from family but they are all wrong.", "NTA - they were playing chicken with you and they lost. They're jerks for not realizing that you're in the \"position of power\" here - they need the cake, you don't need to make a cake.\n\nThey FA&FO. How sad, too bad...\n\nAnd shame on your family saying that you \"screwed\" them - HOW? No money, no cake. It's really that simple...", "NTA. This is why it is often said to never do business with family.", "NTA\nYou do not owe them your time, money and effort.", "NTA a wedding cake is way more involved and costly. You owe them nothing", "NTA\n\n\nYou can't just force someone to make you a cake that's going to cost them money, and not pay. They're being ludicrous.", "Note: I'm not in the US so I have no freaking idea if $400 is a lot for a 3 layer cake. \n\nBut I'd say NTA. There was an agreement and they broke it. They should have said at the very beginning that they wanted the cake as a gift, which would have given you the time to opt out and save the effort of planning and design.", "NTA. You had an agreement.  They didn't stick to it. They were trying to take advantage and you called them on it. Whole thing 100% a problem of their own making.", "Nta. \n\nYou deserve to be compensated for your time and materials. $400 for a 3 tier specialty cake is wildy undervalued.", "NTA. They agreed to pay you and then decided to ignore you hoping you just made the cake. They are lucky you gave them a fair price.", "You told them you needed payment, they agreed, you ask for the payment, they say they'll drop the check, you insist, they say you won't pay you, you say you won't make the cake!\n\nWedding day arrives, they didn't pay and there is no cake - picachu faces!\n\nYou told them you weren't doing it! NTA\n\nThey tried to take advantage of you and it backfired... Of course it's all your fault... /s", "NTA. Not sure if pricing in your area, but that\u2019s the price that I paid a professional bakery for my three tier wedding cake for 100 people.

Bravo!!", "Happy Cakeday to go with the cake story!", "This, and happy cake day!", "For an ignorant person like me, what is the biggest time sink/difficulty of a wedding cake vs. something I throw in the oven for $10?", "Imagine asking someone to make cake for 75 bloody people for free.", "Yeah I wouldn't have accepted a cheque fro the guy either, had he given one.", "Moreover they could have made a counter-offer if they were not happy with the curent offer. Instead, they tried to scam OP. It is on them. NTA", "Yeah the ingredients weren't cheap at all. I had to buy almost triple what I do for regular orders. Plus the strawberries which aren't exactly cheap.", "Can\u2019t scream this loud enough.  I own my own business and I refuse to work for ANY family or friends, parents included.", "For context, I paid $100 for a one layer cake and a dozen cupcakes of the same flavor for a friends birthday to accommodate 20 people. I think $400 for a three layer wedding cake for 75 people is very fair, especially considering the time and labor involved.", "I\u2019d guess OP is in the UK from the spelling of cheque, since in the US we spell it check, but with the money being in dollars who knows. But yeah, cakes are expensive. My brother is also planning a wedding right now, and everything costs a ton because the whole wedding industry is a scam, but it\u2019s a beautiful scam and it\u2019s not my wedding so they can put their money where they want. A big decorated three tier cake could easily be much more than $400, so definitely NTA for wanted to be compensated for work done. The worker deserves her wages. Though if she never asks to be compensated by family but asked to be compensated by bro, it does lead me to think that he has a history of scamming her out of time and effort.", "\"You better make the cake!\"\n\n\"You better shit in one hand and see how that turns out\"\n\nSuper entitled.", "Yes I would've have enough time. I already planned ahead to made the cake the day before the wedding, as it would pretty much take me the whole day to do and I wanted everything to be fresh.\n\nI also had all the ingredients except the strawberries, which wouldn't take me long to run to the store and grab.", "I'll be honest with you, as someone who made their own wedding cake, I didn't start the baking until midnight the day of my wedding because the fresher it is, the better it tastes. Of course I didn't have a 3 tier cake, I had a double layer 9\" cake because my wedding was during the pandemic and it was an intimate affair with very few guests.", "The second bit isn't what happened here. Compensation was a condition of supplying the cake from the start, and they agreed.", "They wouldn't have paid for the ingredients.", "They agreed to pay and the backed out\u2026and you think they should be **REWARDED** for that behavior!?  Hell nawwww.", "NTA family or not they are not entitled to a free wedding cake. And family or not the minute someone looked at me and said I better make the damn cake would not went over at all.", "In fact, I would argue they still owe you about $50 for the time you spent making the sketches and the sample cakes. My money estimate is based on that you said you were charging $400 for the full cake", "Right? I\u2019m 44F and I *still* struggle with shit like this if I\u2019m put on the spot\u2014especially with family.", "Thats what i was thinking\nI mean its not like she can just magically make a cake its hard work", "Yeah I adore baking as well so I get it and you haven't done anything wrong. You laid it all out before hand and they have broken their word.", "You bought the ingredients? I hope you were able to return them!", "On top of that a bakery can get bulk prices and economies of scale. Asking an individual to match that deal when they have to buy all the ingredients at full retail price is asking a lot.", "Could be Canada", ">I\u2019d guess OP is in the UK from the spelling of cheque,\n\nAFAIK know, the whole English speaking world spells it that way, except the US. Though most of them don't use cheques much if at all any more.", "Well, they sure lost out, didn't they? I guess they had to run to the bakery or store then, huh? Bwahahahaha!", "That one I could whip up quickly. But I've only done layers like you're saying, never tiers. \n\nAnd poor you at midnight!", "i struggle too, we always will, but at least when i say no, i don't feel that guilt anymore. i said no.", "Meh, I was too excited to get to bed early that night anyways.  And I had much fun making it.  It was an awesome chocolate mint cake, and was super delicious!", "Ooh, chocolate mint. I've never even had that!\n\nCongratulations on your nuptials whenever they were!", "It was a recipe I put together myself using an amazing chocolate cake recipe as the base, and then figuring out how much peppermint extract I needed to add to the recipe for the proper flavoring. I actually had done it before as a teenager but had to recreate it as an adult.  \n\nAnd thanks :)"]}
