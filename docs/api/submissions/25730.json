But like if you've discussed it between you and he is genuinely like yeah no I wanna do this because it keeps me busy and this is also how I like to show affection and support for you, that's totally chill.

If your boyfriend was uncomfortable doing the majority of the chores or you were uncomfortable or something that would be one thing, but if no one is getting hurt someone outside of the relationship doesn\u2019t get a say in the matter.

It seems like your BF feels bad about temporarily being out of work and not contributing financially so he's just making sure to shoulder all of the non-financial burdens so you don't have to.

If one is working and the other  isn't, they should do the chores no matter what gender each side is.\n\nTotal false equivalence. Just ignore your friend with her useless advice.", "When he worked and I was on break from school I did most of it.

It should be fairly easy to maintain. In fact, your boyfriend has even said he has no difficulty keeping on top of things and doesn't need the help. Presumably, you're at least courteous enough to not be a complete slob and leave a trail of destruction in your wake? Barbra should mind her own business. Maybe you can share whatever tidying needs to be done on your days off, if you don't already? But you don't need anyone else's interference in your relationship if you and your partner are both content.", "NTA and your friend needs to butt out. For brief periods in our relationship, my husband and I have each been unemployed. During those times, whichever of us wasn't working picked u0 most of the chores at home. As long as you are both good with the situation,  and you understand that you will need to start doing more when he starts working again, you're fine.", "Fair and equitable in a relationship is negotiable and subjective.  In my mind, both of you would contribute to bills equitably - as in if you make twice what he does, it might make sense to contribute twice what he does to bills.  Likewise with household chores, but with free time.  If you had twice the free hours he did, it might make sense to do twice the household chores he does.\n\nRight now you make all of the money so you pay all of the bills.  This can make sense.  Likewise he has a lot more free time than you do so he does the household chores.  It wouldn't be beyond the pale for him to ask you to do something, but I think his mindset is that you pay all the bills so he does all the household chores.  That, too, can be fair and equitable.\n\nYou're both showing that you value your relationship enough to pull each other's slack.  You're both contributing and it sounds like both of you are content with the amount you are contributing to the relationship for the moment.\n\nLet him show you how much he values what you are doing for your relationship.  If you want to show him how much you appreciate him as a partner, let him contribute and find another way to show your appreciation (it does sound like you're already doing this).  This is really sweet.\n\nDon't let your apparently jaded friend stir shit.  Get out of your head and just enjoy how much you both KNOW you mean to each other.\n\nEdited to change an incorrect word.", "This is how it\u2019s supposed to be! If whoever is the breadwinner has to do more than a couple dishes and take out the trash after a day\u2019s work then there\u2019s something wrong. Asking for help in a task that came up here and there is one thing as well, but don\u2019t expect me to sweep the floor and prep dinner after working all day. \n\nNot the asshole if not already clear.", "NTA. It makes sense given your current situation for your boyfriend to do more of the household tasks, since he doesn't have to spend any of his time or energy on a job outside the home. That may change when he starts working again and maybe you'll need to redistribute the workload to be more even. But as long as both of you are happy with the situation, enjoy it!\n\nSounds like Barbra has some internalized misogyny that needs to be worked through.", "NTA \nMy man is away for work a good half the time. When he's home, I'm not allowed to do dishes, he does the food, keeps common areas clean. Because he has time. And the less that I have to do, the more time we can do stuff together.", "Your bf is being a stellar partner by picking up the chore slack when he can't help pay bills at the moment. I'd say if the arrangement is working for you both, and neither of you truly have any resentment I think you're good. Mad props to Matt \ud83e\udd18", "NTA, and please clone him. I would like to have one of him too\ud83d\ude09", "Just go talk to him.  Tell him you are feeling a little unsure that your contribution to the household income vs housekeeping is  balanced as someone said that it wasn't.  Ask him if he is happy with the balance and if not, what areas can you look at together and decide on a solution.  You are grown ups, you decide, not your friends.  Barbra's thoughts may or may not be valid - that is up to you both to decide together.", "FFS NTA\n\nThe person who does not work outside the home keeps the home running. \n\nYour friend might have a touch of internal misogyny that tells her a woman's worth is in housework, that you aren't being a good little wifey wifey. And / or she's envious. Treat her with grace.", "NTA\n\nMy BF was out of work for 9 months. I was the breadwinner. He felt like he wasn't pulling his own weight (because he looked at money) but he stepped up and did the house chores and cooking. He has since gone back to work but we alternate cooking and he cleans the house and I maintain the yard and do laundry. You're not an AH for not pushing more, he is probably happy to be doing something to make it feel like he is pulling his weight.", "NTA. If you're happy, and your boyfriend's happy to take care of you, who cares what your friend thinks. I'd ask your partner just to check in, but it sure sounds like he's fine with it.", "I dont know, mostly NTA. But I could see how this could be abused by certain people. I dont think his entire life should revolve around you and your needs, that's incredibly unhealthy.", "NTA. Barbra is jealous, and either unknowingly projecting, or deliberately trying to stir up shit in your relationship.", "NTA!\n\nIf it makes you feel better, every single thing required to keep a house spotless and a spouse fed takes way less than eight hours a day to do. He's getting the better deal here by far.\n\nYou sound like an appreciative and caring person so the warning probably isn't necessary, but definitely expect a reneg when he does find employment.", "NTA   Your and your bf's arraignment is yours to decide.  If it is working and both of you are happy, so be it.\n\nNow if you were to expect the same arraignment after he returns to work, then YWBTA.", "Honestly you two sounds adorable. A lot of guys could be really defensive and insecure letting their GF be the temporary breadwinner, or take it for granted and still expect her to do the chores etc. \n\nInstead, he clearly appreciates you working to support you both, and takes pride in providing you with good food, a clean house, and time to rest when you are home. You guys have teamwork down pat, and I think that\u2019s great.\n\nNTA", "Tell your friend (and anybody else that has an opinion) to mind their own business (maybe not in those words lol). This is your relationship and if your bf thinks it's fine then it's fine. Everyone wants to have an opinion on other people's relationship. None of their concern.", "Your frenemy is a jealous moron.", "NTA at all, you bring the money, he keeps the house. Fair is fair. Once he's working and contributing, you can reevaluate.  Unless having a stay at home hubby appeals to you (sounds pretty nice).", "Barbra sounds like a hater. NTA", "Do not stop telling him how much you appreciate everything he does. Suggestion: be specific in your praise...\"Hon, the living room looks amazing!\" Etc.", "\u2026correct\u2026and you also understand that this arrangement will change when he goes back to work right?", "Now that is so damn cute.", "You two are a good couple.
