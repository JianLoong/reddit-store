In my mind, both of you would contribute to bills equitably - as in if you make twice what he does, it might make sense to contribute twice what he does to bills.  Likewise with household chores, but with free time.  If you had twice the free hours he did, it might make sense to do twice the household chores he does.\n\nRight now you make all of the money so you pay all of the bills.  This can make sense.  Likewise he has a lot more free time than you do so he does the household chores.  It wouldn't be beyond the pale for him to ask you to do something, but I think his mindset is that you pay all the bills so he does all the household chores.  That, too, can be fair and equitable.\n\nYou're both showing that you value your relationship enough to pull each other's slack.  You're both contributing and it sounds like both of you are content with the amount you are contributing to the relationship for the moment.\n\nLet him show you how much he values what you are doing for your relationship.

It makes sense given your current situation for your boyfriend to do more of the household tasks, since he doesn't have to spend any of his time or energy on a job outside the home.

There will be times where you will need to go the extra mile for him, and that will be fine. Relationships have a push/pull dynamic like that.", "NTA and it\u2019s weird your friend thinks you need to help him clean. He has a job, and you have a job. I think you two have a very nice relationship and I wish I could have his job (cleaning and loving) alas I will probably have to actually work. What you two have works perfectly and is in balance. I\u2019m telling you, this is when anxiety kicks in and you think you need to do more. Remember: you are earning money for the house and loving him. He is taking care of the house and loving you. He doesn\u2019t need help, and neither do you. Do not feel pressured to do more especially since you work hard 8 hours a day. He cleans so you can feel at home when you get home. I love your situation!", "NTA.  If you and your boyfriend have worked this out between you, and you're both happy with it, then it's all good.  You'd be TA if you were *refusing* to pick up your share of the chores, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.  Maybe it wouldn't suit your friend, but it doesn't have to.", "NTA. He has all day to do this stuff and makes good use of the time. You have a good partner.", "NTA Barbara is jealous. I wouldn\u2019t trust her with anything. I bet she\u2019s gossiping about you already.", "You have the equivalent of a SAHH- stay at home husband, as long as both of you are cool with the arrangement and the house is clean, both of you have a say in how any extra money is saved/spent then it is all good. \n\nNTA - Barbra's husband might need to help out more around the house from the sounds of it though or let her have more say in things but that isn't your fight, OP.", "NTA. Sounds like a case of the green eyed monster!", "how can we survive for a few hours without a reverse gender posting, thanks for the efforts OP!", "NTA - don't over complicate things. It's all good. When he returns to work things will change so work hard, come home, and lounge with your SO.", "Wow. What a thoughtful boyfriend. NTA, as long as you share things more evenly when he goes back to work.", "NTA. This is called division of labor. One person working? Or doing the majority of work? The other picks up more chores/slack around the house. If the dynamic changes , the division can be adjusted. Your friend is thinking along traditional gender roles, but your boyfriend seems like he\u2019s all for it. \n\nTbh if my wife worked a job that supported the family I\u2019d stay at home dad in a second. Get the cleaning / chores done. Hell, even learn to cook a few more dishes.", "You have hit the jackpot. What a great dude. Don\u2019t tell my wife.", "What matters is that you and your partner feel what you are doing is reasonable and fair. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to mind her own business.\n\nWhen Matthew returns to work will be time enough to redistribute the load of chores. He's happy, you express gratitude, he has the time and energy, you don't. Leave the man alone and make sure he knows you really appreciate what he's doing.", "NTA. You are doing enough.", "NTA and neither is your boyfriend. He is doing all the housework and it will never add up to what you do at work. Make sure this changes when he starts working too. Until then, you are fine.", "NTA. Has been discussed and revisited, they're both happy, and he seems attentive and a walking green flag. If the dude reads, stop raising the bar so goddamn much for the rest of us mortals /s", "My ex and I had the same thing.  (I should note that we are not split up because of my being a SAHM.). It worked very well for us.  He earned almost all the money until the kids were in school and then I worked part time during the school day.  He occasionally did laundry, cooking, shopping except when I was on bedrest due to high risk pregnancies when he did more if family wasn't helping.  The only household chores that I didn't do related to lawn care, some car care, home maintenance, and the exterior of windows.  It was, to me, only fair.", "> Tell your friend to piss right off.\n\n\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd is the comment I was looking for!"]}
