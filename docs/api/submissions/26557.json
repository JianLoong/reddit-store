When each of us moved out, our parents gave us access to our a savings account they had made for each of us when we first started working\u2026. It was all the money we had given them.

You mentioned that both households are comfortable but don't make a lot of money. It may not be worth the cost of attorney fees for what you want. My thought is to look into the resources for teens mentioned here \nin the comments, compile the evidence of salary taken from your son and maybe consider keeping it simple, taking them to small claims court. It may vary by state on filing fees, but we chose to represent ourselves in a suite with our homeowners insurance and paid a $75 fee. We won the case and moved on quickly. \n\nI definitely agree on doing a credit check to ensure there has been no identity theft as well. Switching banks and freezing credit with all 3 credit agencies is a must if there is any concern. \n\nNow, with all that said. There is some validity to contributing to the household, but that can be in other ways like mowing the lawn, cooking meals, or doing his own laundry. It teaches both life skills and responsibility. Once he graduates HS and is a FT working adult then a predetermined amount toward bills is not unreasonable as he prepares himself to launch.

If you find anything on those reports associated with a credit card, loan or anything else indicating someone has gotten anything in your son\u2019s name please follow the directions for reporting it and let the chips fall where they may.  \n\n- Also search for how to lock credit for a minor.  When you do the lock for the credit be sure you retain all the information they give you as it may be needed to unlock it when son is older.  When he does unlock it should be for a specific reason and he can then give a number of days after which it will automatically go back to locked.  \n\n- You already noted you will be following up on child support changes.

Ideally you can open it so it is either you or Jayden so he can remove money from it when he wants. \n\n - if Jayden was auto depositing his paycheck to some other account be sure he updates that info before you close the old one.  If he was auto depositing into his dad\u2019s account Jayden will need to speak with his father to get his money returned to him which ideally will go smoothly.

By law, in almost any area, parents are required by law to support their children until 18.  The child does not owe a parent anything for having been born.  File a petition with the courts demanding that your ex and his wife return the full amount of money stolen, and are not allowed to have any access to Jayden's bank accounts in any way.  And put a lockdown on his SS#, as it's likely these moochers might attempt to open accounts in his name.  Do a full review of his credit history, so you can bring it with to court when you have a discussion about the wage theft.  The courts should also be able to issue a restraining order since the ex clearly does not consider it his fiduciary duty to support his son, so you want to remove the options for emotional blackmail by not allowing him near your son.  At 16, Jayden will likely have a heavy weight of say in the decision, as he is old enough to testify on his own behalf.", "NTA, they were financially abusing your son.

Maybe one/two dinners a week.  etc.", "Definitely NTA\n\nYes Jayden needs to help from time to time but not take all his paycheck he's not even 18 but it's very obvious that Jayden's dad and step mom treat him like an 18 year old", "NTA. They were being greedy and manipulative. You're being a good mom protecting your son from that nonsense. Their immaturity while he moved out just confirms that.", "NTA I went through EXACTLY the same thing with my son but he was an adult (18). He had a set agreement of what he would pay toward the household but every time he\u2019d save money, there was emergency. It took him 2 hours by bus to get to his job each way. They charged his money for gas for the week and would only take him one day. They also told him he would never amount to anything. His self esteem was nonexistent. I moved him with me and they called him every name in the book. Good for you for getting him out of there mom!!! He is still a kid and not responsible for their household. If he\u2019d volunteered that\u2019s one thing but they literally made him a slave.", "NTA.    They were using a child for extra money.   Not cool.   It's one thing to garnish his cheques to put aside for Jayden to have back later for school or whatever(helping him plan for the future) but you do not charge a minor to live with you.   And the emotional abuse and guilt trips are so bad for his mental health.   \n\nJayden is better off with you.  And he honestly shouldn't even be mad to visit them ever again if he doesn't want to.  Thank you for standing up for him and doing what's right \n\nDo not let your ex manipulate you or make you feel guilty about doing what is right for your son.", "NTA- You're protecting your child from people who are, at best, showing abusive behaviours.", "NTA, but he shouldn\u2019t be contributing to any household bills as a minor. They are emotionally manipulating him and stealing his money. If anything, you didn\u2019t react strongly enough at the beginning", "NTA. Your ex is financially abusing your son. You have the right and the responsibility to protect your child. You did the right thing!", "He\u2019s 16\n\nWhere I come from, you can move out of home / drive / get married at that age etc\n\nTeaching him to contribute a small amount / budget / manage his money is a vital life skill. \n\nI had to do the same as an older teenager and it made me learn excellent money management.", "And please look into child support, custody, & visitation ASAP.", "NTA. In addition to getting child support, you may need to have the courts make Jayden's father pay him back. You don't charge a MINOR CHILD rent and utilities. It is LITTERALLY the father's job to feed and house the kid. And being a step parent comes with the probability that any kids will live with you for some amount of time.", "Get him another bank account that his dad can't access too", "FYI, this is called junior financial abuse. It's certainly illegal in the UK, and I would imagine in the US as well.", "I\u2019d definitely do that.  And make sure to have the evidence of this financial abuse (bank statements, pay stubs, etc.) included in the materials you provide to the court.  In the amount you ask for, I\u2019d also ask that they repay what they took from him.  He deserves every dollar he earned.  They weren\u2019t teaching him responsibility, they were just plain stealing from him.\n\nI\u2019d also open a new account at a different bank for his paycheques to go into from now on to be absolutely sure that your ex can\u2019t get access.", "You're a good man.", "No jury would convict a minor over murder in that scenario.   I think some cop might have scared you with that one - no DA would ever take that case.", "Change email, social accounts, phone passwords too. Don't block his phone number or social midia, because his texts can be used as evidence. Alert school about changes. And tell your son not to pick hides or meet his dad without telling you.", "Appreciate it! My wife(+1!!!) and little girl will neverrrrrrr know what that\u2019s like. \n\nThe women in my home have a voice. They feel safe. They want to be here. This home dynamic means the world to me. \n\nI have started a new adhd medication and it makes me  super expressive. Thanks for the response!", "I was 17 2 months from 18 in Utah. They were very convinced as in the police.", "It\u2019s not shitty laws, it\u2018s shitty no account parents", "Nope. Since the parent is named on the account, they legally have access to the money as well. Morally and ethically wrong, but legal", "At University I didn\u2019t always have a job and when I did, I didn\u2019t always pay anything. My parents also paid for my overseas study to Leeds which was really quite expensive and I couldn\u2019t have afforded myself. They also gave me money every week while I was over there so I didn\u2019t have to work.\n\nI graduated with distinction and was rewarded for that. I attribute my diligence with money now, and throughout my life, to the lessons my parents taught me growing up. Your parents rewarding you for good marks is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with what I was talking about.", "Completely wrong!"]}
