Jayden's Dad and I divorced 10 years ago when Jayden was 6. I'm still single while Jayden's dad has remarried to his wife (36F.)   \nJayden has lived with his Dad and Stepmom on weekdays and me on the weekends since he started High School 2 years since his school is much closer to his Dad's house. Jayden mainly goes to school, plays football with his friends and work part time at the local McDonald's. Being honest, neither Jayden's Dad nor I make a lot of money. We both live comfortably but we certainly can't afford luxuries. That's why Jayden wanted to work. He need money to go out with his friends.   \nWhen he got his job I found out that Jayden's Dad and Stepmom were making him give them money for bills. I didn't care at the time, its teaching him financial responsibility was my only thought. Come to find out there were taking up to 70% of his check which made Jayden upset. That did me upset as well. Yes, Jayden is still a kid and should help out from time to time but he works so hard and deserves more of his own money. I talked to his Dad who promised to make a budget with Jayden that would please both of them. I hoped this would this would fix the issue.   \nThat conversation was a 3 months ago. Today Jayden told me that they have been taking 100% of his paychecks. A quick look at his account confirmed this. Jayden also told me that whenever he tries to set limits with his Dad or Stepmom they guilt him by saying things like \"I helped bring you into this world the least you can do is help me out. (From his dad.)\" And \"you're not my child but I let you let live with me anyway. (From his Stepmom.)\"  \n   \nI really don't like this behavior from those two. That kind of talk seems like manipulation and it makes me uncomfortable. I told Jayden that I wanted him to live with me for the remainder of the school year away from his Dad and Stepmom. He's old enough to the point where the courts can't force anything and he agreed.   \nWe went to his Dad's place to get some of his things and to tell that Jayden was moving. They helped us get some of his stuff but instead of handing it to us they'd throw it. Not a hard throw but still off putting. We left the house with Jayden's things and went home.  \nWhile I do feel justified I do have seconds thoughts about removing Jayden from his Dad like that. Even if he agreed.

Great job for standing up for your son!", "NTA, but I almost want to call you out for not doing more sooner. A minor child should **never** be forced to contribute to bills unless it is *absolutely necessary*, and it should be a last last resort, after cutting down on every single luxury from the parent.", "Obviously NTA. They should not have to rely on their teen son for money.", "NTA \n\nYou acknowledged your son was in a bad situation where he was being taken advantage of and guilt tripped by your ex and his wife into giving them all his earnings.\n\nYou made the right call moving your son in with you and getting him away from them.", "That is insane. I was a single parent with 3 kids, i worked 2 jobs to make ends meet. If i ever got in a spot where i needed to borrow $20 to get gas or milk, i paid that kid back with interest as soon as i got paid. I was the adult, it was my job to pay the bills not my kids. NTA", "your son was being extorted by his father and by his stepmother. it doesn't seem like manipulation on their parts. they were manipulating your son. you might consider involving the police. they may be able to assist in recovering your son's lost wages from them. so he can buy himself something nice for the work he did at mcdonald's. paid work he did of his own accord as a minor which i find very impressive and something for which he should feel proud.", "NTA. Financial abuse is abuse. File for a custody/support modification immediately. Also, talk to your son about not succumbing to such guilt and pressure.", "NTA  \nBut at the very least document everything. I still recommend getting a lawyer though. He is still a minor and courts technically still can force your hand, even though they aren't likely to at this age. Also, what his dad was doing may be able to be reversed still, so definitely look into lawyering up and seeing your options regarding getting his money back as well as child support.  \nAnd last but not least, get that kid a new account that dad has ZERO access to!  \nNew account, new pin numbers, lock that SOB out of it all! (And any social accounts or emails dad has access to too) But before you shut down the old, screenshot EVERYTHING.", "NTA at all, and I really think you should think about pursuing some sort of legal action against his dad and stepmom.

They were stealing from your son.", "NTA - it\u2019s one thing for parents to have kids pay for extras but household bills is OTT.

Sends completely the wrong message.", "good job for protecting your kid from such manipulative, selfish assholes. \n\n'Jayden is still a kid and should help out from time to time...\" \nI don't agree with this sentiment at all as it's the job of the parent to provide for the child with the obvious exception of situations where parents are having trouble making ends meet; which doesn't seem to be the case here.", "Absolutely NTA!

Always.   \n\nAnd as a side, to ask a child in high school to contribute more than half of his paycheck from an afterschool job towards household bills is outrageous!

He is a child, it is his parent's responsibility to feed, clothe and house him.\n\nIt's good he's out of there (change his banking arrangements asap btw) but you should have acted sooner.", "NTA They're financially and emotionally abusing him. I know he's old enough to decide where he lives, but it's probably worth getting some of this on record so they can't try and change how anything is set up financially between you two. If that's how his dad treats him, he shouldn't be around his dad.", "Nta the things they guilted him about is what parents do fir their kids.

That did me upset as well\" right? \n\nYou are right to be upset and concerned when Jayden earned HIS money all for himself and learn how to be finanicially independent/responsible only for his dad and stepmum to treat him like an auto money machine from the bank. This is totally NOT okay and it is both financial exploitation and abuse against a child. What is it gonna be next once Jayden finishes school? Them making Jayden work full time upon graduation and forcing him to give up his university dreams all just to 100 percent give up his money to feed and clothe them? Or worse forcing him to take up loans all to subsidise them? His dad and stepmum are able bodied healthy adults and shame on them! \n\nMoving forward, you don't just lawyer up for child support but do get in touch with a local child/teen organisation that has someone who specialises in financial exploitation/abuse against teens. I am sure they will tell you that because Jayden is under 18 and a minor, he by right does not have to contribute to household bills or subsidise his dad and stepmum\n\nDo look into making a new bank account and make sure Jayden's tax/social security number will not be abused by his dad or stepmum by taking up loans under his number and name to make sure Jayden's credit rating is not affected.

Do consider creating a small trust fund where only you, Jayden and a person you can trust can access the money alone for Jayden's schooling, university and his expenses\n\nPlease talk to Jayden and tell him this is not his fault and it is not right for people to take advantage of him just because he is earning money from a part-time job", "Oh Dear One\u2026your boy is 16 and has had to come live with you full time due to his father and wife stealing all his money?

Don't forget to do a credit check on him to make sure father dearest and stepmum are not using his social security/tax number to take up loans or credit cards under his name.

Im so happy to see a parent fighting for their kid like this!", "Jayden also needs to get a new email address and password.

Again to be in the safe side.\n\nThen update all accounts as needed", "You can\u2019t control what happens in the other house, but as OP mentioned. Kids at 16 have agency and can choose where they want to live. The money snatching parents had it coming and handed it very poorly.", "I agree with your sentiment but, while parents are required to provide support, they also often have the right to keep the child's wages (not gifts or inheritance however). This varies from state to state. If the earnings are from entertaining (child actor) the parents are usually required to keep 15% of the earnings in trust for the child until the child turns 18.\n\nThat does not make what the dad and stepmom are doing right: they are being total assholes.\n\nIn this case the main thing is to get the child's earnings out of an account that dad and step mom can access. Along with changing the custody and support agreement asap.", "Very good points. \nI think jayden can also request a new social security number.", "No doubt I definitely agree with that one. I just feel for OP. \n\nAnd I think I replied to the wrong message. \n\nApologies."]}
