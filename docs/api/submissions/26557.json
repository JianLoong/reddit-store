He's old enough to the point where the courts can't force anything and he agreed.   \nWe went to his Dad's place to get some of his things and to tell that Jayden was moving. They helped us get some of his stuff but instead of handing it to us they'd throw it. Not a hard throw but still off putting.

You had your son's back and you are doing the right thing so applauds for that. I feel so bad for the son being ROBBED of HIS hard earned money while being gaslit by everyone around him that it was the right way (until you turned your boat around eventually).

At that age that is so commendable and will take him far UNLESS his mentality and spirit gets corrupted by the leeching and gaslighting shameless father and his equally disgusting wife.

And not to give up on his spirit ever in life, no matter how some people can try to take advantage off him. This is important. He did the right thing standing up for himself and voicing his concerns persistently.\n\nI applaud him cause even from this story I can see he is a stand up guy working hard and taking no shit and abuse. Don't let him turn into adulthood feeling bitter, wronged and gaslit by everyone around him. Instead feeling supported and grateful that someone had his back let him remain inspired and focused for his future and the well deserved success that awaits him eventually in his life whatever path he chooses to take upon. With the right mindset he is on a very great path, don't let it be poisoned now.\n\nMaybe even show him this reddit thread for him to see how much support and applauds he has.
