OP and her brother are not close and OP had no warning beforehand. OP's brother should have gotten confirmation to send the photo first. Her brother's intentions were innocent and the photo is innocent but that doesn't mean he shouldn't have asked first. If OP wasn't his sister we'd definitely think he should have asked first. \n\n\n\nINFO I'm guessing you're not close. How was he posed? To me this reads as completely innocent. However if you don't want to him like that I think that's fair too. He should have asked you before he sent it. I think calling him a pervert if he doesn't have a history of bad behavior extreme. However you are not in the wrong if that's not something you are comfortable with. He should have confirmed it was okay.", "NTA - You're not TA for having a boundary of not wanting your brother to send you near nude photos. This is not the same thing as seeing him in swim trunks or shorts. If you sent him a pic of yourself in a bra and panties and asked him what he thought I highly doubt people would call him TA for feeling uncomfortable. \n\nEveryone's family dynamics are different but just because the people here don't see an issue doesn't make your reaction any less valid. You also stated that you're not close to him so this isn't normal behavior.", "Obviously you two dont have that kind of relationship so NTA.", "Ima go against the majority but NTA.\nLook its weird overall considering you guys aren\u2019t close (from what I\u2019ve gathered from your comments) it\u2019s definitely odd that he sent that to you looking to see if you thought they looked good considering he was asking in a way that basically was meant as \u201chey do these look attractive\u201d because that\u2019s essentially what he asked since he was doing this for his crush. I\u2019d definitely be a bit creeped out if my brothers did this to me. Everyone\u2019s relationship with their siblings is different.", "Is this the first time something like this has happened?", "NTA. No one wants to see their brother in his undies. LOL", "NTA\n\nI can tell who has a brother on here and who doesn't. My brother and I are very close, I am the person he normally goes to for relationship advice, and he would NEVER do this. This is creepy. You don't send your siblings photos of you in your underwear and ask if they're acceptable to send on to a crush. There are lines of acceptable behaviour in all relationships, and I don't know any siblings who would do this and think its OK.", "NAH\n\nIf the genders were flipped and a girl sent a pic of herself in panties to her brother, I have a feeling there would be far fewer Y T A votes. \n\nHere's the thing: men's bodies and men's underwear have not been sexualized the way women's have. Add on to this the fact that men's underwear tends to be much less revealing than women's. Male relatives often freely walk around in their underwear around female relatives. Even PG rated sitcoms will show guys in their underwear like it's no big deal. \n\nFrom your perspective, you see underwear and think its sexual, which makes sense; after all, you would certainty be viewed as sexual if you sent a panty pic or walked around your house in nothing but panties. \n\nHowever, from your brother's perspective, he likely has a different relationship with his body and undergarments because they are not sexualized the same way women's are. So to him it's not that weird. \n\nI would go ahead an apologize and explain to him that it struck you as odd because you couldn't imagine sending him a pic of you in your underwear. Then I would request that he doesn't send you future pics like that since you can't help but think of underwear pics as sexual.", "YTA\n\nHe literally sought feedback from a FORMERLY trusted source. Unless there's a history between you two you aren't sharing here, it sounds completely innocent. Your reaction is so over the top. Good news? At least he isn't likely to bother with your opinion moving forward.", "LOL NTA is he even dating this other girl or is he just gonna send her random photos lol", "NTA\n\nI would be seriously worried if my brother did that.", "Sending underwear pics to siblings is just weird. Your also the last person to be about to tell him if his package looks hot in his underwear. That's just creepy. I have 4 brothers. I do not want to see any of them that naked and I know they don't want to know what their sister thinks of them naked. Also, his crush? So not someone who wants to see that. No wonder he has no female friends. NTA", "I think NAH. He seemed to mean it in an innocent way and sees you as someone he can trust. But his execution could have been better. On the other hand, I totally understand why you were bothered by it, but I think you may have overreacted a good bit. \n\nMaybe ask yourself would you feel equally creeped out if your mom/sister/female cousin asked for your opinion on a bra? (I personally have often gone bra shopping with female family members and it was no biggie, but not all families are that open.) If you would react the same way if a girl did it, okay fine, you just aren\u2019t okay being that open with people and are creeped out by seeing family members in their underwear no matter who it is. But if a sister sent you a bra pic and you would instead react in support of her? Well then I think that tells you that you reacted the way you did solely because he\u2019s a boy and *not* because his actions were meant in a creepy way.", "NTA this is how people test the waters to see if you'd be into incest. Whether that was his intention or not, and whether he's aware of that or not, he needs to understand that he can't behave this way.", "NTA.\n\nAnd tell your brother if he isn't going out with the girl he wants to impress, he's an even more massive creep if he shows *her* his underwear.", "NTA. Your brother is trying to bang you. I\u2019ve spent enough time on 4chan to be able to identity this behavior", "> he doesn't have any other female friends to show it to\n\nI can't imagine why. NTA.", "NTA he could have asked before he randomly sent the pics", "NTA. Sending unsolicited nude/underwear shots will always be an AH move.", "Unless he\u2019s always creepy or making weird comments to you I think the dude just wants advice haha. So YTA, unless he\u2019s a proven actual creep.", "I don't see anything wrong with what your brother did and I wouldn't have found it creepy if my brother did the same. But I don't know anything about your relationship with your brother nor about the culture you both come from so it's really difficult to judge.", "I would be weirded out, too. Since you said this was the first (& hopefully only! ) time he sent pics of himself in his underwear I\u2019ll say NAH. You both have different levels of comfort when it comes to this. Maybe \u201cderanged creep\u201d was a little much, I suggest apologizing for that phrasing & say to him you\u2019re not comfortable with what he asked and he should ask a male friend or his dad. If he really wants a female opinion ask mom or surely he has a female friend or a BFF\u2019s gf who he can ask. I hope he\u2019d apologize for calling you a prude  in return.", "INFO: this heavily depends on culture, in some cultures this will be a huge issue but in others it won't be a problem. \n\nSo what kind of culture runs in your family?", "NTA. I think it\u2019s natural for siblings to be sexually repulsed by each other. I (F) have no problem seeing my friends\u2019 naked boobs in the change room but seeing my sister\u2019s naked boobs makes me want to gouge out my eyeballs.", "NTA.\n\nEven with the purest intentions, what a weird question to ask a sibling. \"Hey sis, do I look sexy in this underwear?\" he's asking his sibling to rate his near-nude appearance. that's weird af. \n\neither he's completely oblivious, or this crush is actually *you*", "So your brother sent you pics wanting you to confirm his package looked good? NTA. If that isn't the type of relationship you have then it's completely creepy", "I feel a but crazy here NTA.\n\nI would never send my brother a photo of myself in lingerie and ask if he thought the guy I liked would like it. This is basically the same thing. Even a photo in underwear if you don't have that casual and open of a relationship is a bit too sexual for a lot of people. Especially given he was asking for her opinion on the look of it.\n\nMost people don't want to show off their underwear for non-sexual reasons", "If my brother did that disowned I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t need to see you in your boxers If I sent a picture to my brother in a bra and panties it would be seen as disgraceful and it is sending nudes to siblings is disgraceful some of these comments make feel sick", "NTA- he shoulda asked Reddit.", "NTA\n\nAnd EW! He should (actually, YOU SHOULD) send those pics to your PARENTS. If he's living at home still, why couldn't he just walk into the kitchen and get the parents' opinion? Probably because they'd kill him?\n\nThis is disgusting and wrong and you should tell your parents. What the actual...EW!", "NTA. He could\u2019ve asked before sending that at least, it\u2019s normal that you wouldn\u2019t want to see it regardless of his intentions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. But I wouldn\u2019t call him an AH for wanting an opinion from someone he trusts either, he just could have given a heads up & described what the underwear looked like", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand everyone saying you are. He sent a unsolicited pic of himself near nude that he intends to send to a crush. Why is he sending you, his sister, a picture meant for a romantic and possibly sexual interest? I think people are over looking this because he\u2019s your brother, but if you wouldn\u2019t want unsolicited pics from strangers in their underwear why would it be okay for your brother to send a pic like that. \n\nAlso the brother didn\u2019t even ask he just sent it. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any female friends\u201d I wonder why. You are not overreacting, would I have said something different, maybe but you still are within your right to act the way you did.", "This is weird AF. How would this sound if it was a sister sending a bra and undie selfie, unwarranted, to her brother? NTA.", "I think the reality here is that you both just don't have that type of relationship. Some siblings do! It appears that you both don't and now he knows that.", "NTA\n\nIf you guys don\u2019t have like a goofy sibling relationship like that, he wasn\u2019t being goofy, and sends that unsolicited that\u2019s really weird. My brother has sent me a boomerang of him like slapping his beer gut which is funny to me. But underwear\u2026 for a \u201cfemale opinion\u201d gross.", "People saying your the ass but idk it's kinda weird", "NTA, I would never in a million years do this to my sister.", "NTA and this is a good moment for your brother to learn NOT to send risqu\u00e9 photos to anyone who has not already said they would like to receive them.\n\nThank goodness he was in underwear but all the \"unsolicited dick pic\" rules still apply. \n\nAny photo too suggestive to be shared in the company teams chat is too suggestive to be sent without warning & consent.", "I dont see nothing sexual in what your brother did, if he was not in any provocative or elicitating sexual poses.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even have glorified him with a response. It\u2019s not your job to tell him how he looks in barely any clothing. He needs to find a female friend for that.", "There are siblings who share rooms their entire childhood and boxers offer as much coverage as swim trucks, hell more on a lit of countries where speedos are the norm.  If the pose isn\u2019t sexual, I\u2019d just let him know he should ask more specifically ahead of time.  \n\nYes, If if was a sister asking a brother probably get a different response but that\u2019s kind of the core reality, we don\u2019t treat or think of guy\u2019s bodies the same so to him it was probably a nothing act.", "Yes YTA. My brother literally came into the hospital to meet my child and didn't make a big deal about me only being in a top and underwear. (Granted I didn't know he was coming.) If you think he's being sexual then that's a YOU problem.", "Strange that your mind went straight to sex. This is your brother. That thought shouldn\u2019t have even crossed your mind. Annoying, sure, but he isn\u2019t trying to hit on you. Probably just a little insecure and seeking out the opinion of a trusted female he knows. \n\nYTA for massively overreacting.", "YTA if it is true that he just wanted an honest opinion.

Does he ask you for advice on things like school/work/relationships/etc? If you do have this sort of relationship, I would say this is an innocent thing - he is trying to impress a girl and wants to know if he looks good. He's (hopefully) not trying to insinuate anything and hopefully he asks before sending this to his crush.

Like, immediate, immediate no, brothers and sisters have absolutely no place in judging each other's near-nude photos sorry.", "this reply should be on r/nosleep", "I guess I took it in a very different way\u2014less \u201cdo I look sexy?\u201d and more \u201care these unflattering/embarrassing/making me look weird?\u201d \nEx: I have gone bra shopping with my female relatives a few times because sometimes an outside perspective helps. Like, is the back of the bra cutting into me and giving me back fat rolls? Is it a gross color with my skin tone? Are these rhinestone straps classy or do they just make me look like a hooker? Do I just like this because it\u2019s my favorite color, or is it actually flattering? That sort of thing. I took this situation in the same light I guess, the only difference being that one party is male, and so society has deemed it less acceptable than if it were a sister asking bra opinions.", "He was asking his sister if he looked good in the context of wanting women to find him sexually attractive. That's bizarre.", "You\u2019re describing two different situations. At the end of the day op\u2019s brother didn\u2019t even ask if he can send the pic, he sent a unsolicited pic of himself near nude that is intended for a romantic and/or sexual interest.", "Because he is", "He literally asked me how good he looks in his underwear, so how was I the one making it sexual ?", "Siblings that grow up with each other still don't see each other in their underwear. I don't know what my siblings look like in their underwear, and I am very thankful for that. \n\nMaybe you and your siblings are the weird ones.", "Yeah it definitely depends on the pose too! I don\u2019t think he meant it sexually either with the context given so far", "It was underwear and pretty tight one at that. Tho he wasn't posing and just standing there.", "We're not really close, but neither are we enemies. So a pretty neutral relationship I guess.", "Nah man, even if they are close if they don't have a history of this, he should've been asking before sending that. That's more than close. That's a very certain kind of relationship.", "I don't think he had bad intentions but he should have confirmed you were okay with it first. So N T A for being uncomfortable. I think you should talk to him about it.", "Are you step-siblings?", "Ok, with that in mind, it seems like you\u2019re overreacting. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH though. Also, he should have asked if he could get your opinion first, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a creep either. This story shows he trusted your opinion and respects your honesty. \n\nMaybe give it some time so you can reflect on this situation without the unpleasant gut response? It sounds pretty innocent overall.", "He wasn't discussing sex. He sent a near-nude photo of himself. That's so different.", "Exactly, I'm sure the majority of the male commenters here would not like it if their sister sent them a photo in a tight bra and panties asking if her crush would like it. People are accusing OP of sexualising things, but like...underwear you want to wear to impress a crush is sexual by nature surely? It sounds like OP's brother is just a bit innocent/oblivious but like, I would simply ick out of existence at the idea of asking my brother to comment on my sexy undies. \n\nI think OP definitely overreacted but it should at least be a NAH given that the photos were sprung upon her with no context.", "Your brother sounds like a creep that\u2019s going to harass this poor girl", "near nude pics I think is excessive as a definition of someone in underware.\n\nwhen you go to the beach, you see people in \"underware\" as well so I dont think this is a fair assessment.", "I'm not sure how many people from Romania you are going to get. Maybe add that to your original post. I'm from the US where people even sometimes go swimming in their underwear, so there may be a culture difference.", "I'm not judging you. \nI would have found it creepy if it was my brother but that's the way it is in my home.", "YTA. I\u2019m not Romanian but I\u2019ve seen tons of porn with Romanian chicks and they definitely react positively to their brother walking in on them wearing nothing but underwear.", "I mean....what her brother did is weird AF and because of that, of course now this is a question in peoples minds. Bro needs to read up on appropriate boundaries.", "People doing stupid af syllogisms here like everything in their life is applicable to the situation.", "how???", "You're getting a lot of hate, but it's very normal to not want your brother sending sexy pics asking if he looks hot.", "Because your first instinct was to immediately assume he was hitting on you. It\u2019s an extreme reaction", "Did you ever go swimming with your siblings?", "I have four siblings and we lived in small, crappy apartments throughout my childhood. There was only ever one bathroom, and with five people in total (single mom) we sometimes had to share it. \n\nTo be fair, though, I grew up in Germany with unisex saunas and nude beaches. Nudity was never a big deal.", "Depends how big your house is I guess", "Haven't you seen them in bathing suits at least?\n\nIt's weird to be so afraid of seeing a human body. It's not like he sent dick pics.", "If that's the case it's strange he sent it and it's OK if you tell him so. But that's no justification for calling him a creep. That's a very nasty thing to call someone and this was clearly not sexual.", "Would she react the same way if it was her sister? Between siblings the gender doesn't matter.", "No.", "I don't think she's overreacting at all. This is bizarre, full stop. Best case scenario here is that her brother is just a really socially awkward person with no understanding of appropriate boundaries.", "I mean do you have a brother you\u2019re not that close with? I\u2019ve been harassed by my brother and that\u2019s all I will say but this is creepy\u2026", "I didn\u2019t say he was discussing sex? Did you even read my comment? Also, near nude isn\u2019t nude, and some families are very comfortable with this.", "A \"near nude\" photo of himself wearing the same she would have seen anytime they went swimming together?", "Nah fam you don\u2019t send lewds you want to be sexual without knowing it\u2019s being sexual and you definitely don\u2019t send them to your siblings ever I cant go with ignorance he\u2019s 19 not 13 full blown NTA I would disown my brother for that shit", "ew your brother needs to learn boundaries because he's making me uncomfortable and I'm just reading this", "Yea I see people in their underwear but they're not my relatives asking me to judge if it's hot or not.", "In most places of southern Europe if u go swimming in underwear you get kicked out of any swimming pool and laughed at the beach at least. Middle Europe thermal baths also ask you to be fully naked but never in underwear.\n\nIdk about northerners. I wouldn't bathe in a cold sea.", "I think this should be the judging factor. Is it normal in OPs home to see him in boxers or swim shorts? If yes, then he\u2019s not being a creep. If no, then it\u2019s a little off but I still wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s a creep for asking for an opinion? If he has done numerous things that are along a line of making people feel uncomfortable then yes he is a creep.", "Me and my brother have this relationship. He would never touch me nor me him. He\u2019s my rock. I would never assume that thought. At all. But people are different.", "What does house size have to do with it? As long as you are changing and using the restroom alone with the door closed, you won't have to see anyone in their underwear. Even if you share rooms, you take turns changing. I feel like that is a given with bathrooms, no one else should be in there while you're using it unless it's a small child that needs bathroom supervision.\n\nIn my experience, this problem only arises when you allow people to be in common spaces in their underwear. That is definitely weird, and has nothing to do with house size.\n\nEdit: the only household I've ever seen where underwear in common spaces was allowed, was a female friend with a single mother and 2 sisters. However, that rule ended as soon as my friend got her first boyfriend.", "Bathing suits are very different from underwear. No one I know is wearing speedos and string bikinis to the beach. We're a board shorts and one piece type of family I guess. It's not even a rule, like we don't have to cover up around family or anything, we just all prefer bathing suits with more coverage I guess.", "Lol, that's naive. Gender totally matters between most siblings.", "This part", "Well that\u2019s why I asked if this was a first time occurrence. Since she\u2019s literally never once had this issue in the past, it\u2019s likely an innocent mistake as opposed to him being some kind of pervert. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But who knows? Not me or you", "But it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s comfortable with this. It sounds like this violates the boundaries they had growing up.", "It's not hot or not, it's does this make me look weird or is it ok.", "how the fact there are your relatives, make any difference?\n\nI mean if your sister or brother cannot rely on you for a honest opinion, who?  \nAgain, this is not related to a sexual request of any kind.", "Op said they aren\u2019t close", "You\u2019re pretty skittish huh?\n\nThe house I grew up in had one bathroom. I\u2019d usually go from bathroom to bedroom in just a towel after a shower. It never occurred to me that this habit was in any way provocative to my family members \n\nBut I guess I\u2019m the weird one", "I mean the fact that you think anyone not in a one piece is wearing a string bikini kind of tells me you're far from being the authority on what's normal.", "We don\u2019t know but we can understand red flags and this is a red flag. It all starts with one issue and usually escalates", "That\u2019s absolutely fine, she needs to communicate that. I\u2019m not saying people can\u2019t have boundaries, I\u2019m saying I would have had a different reaction and her calling him a deranged creep is not a good day to establish boundaries.", "Yeah, I wonder why. He opens up to her and she calls him a creep.", "Oh I see so your family just doesn't care about nakedness at all. I'm not saying that's wrong, but it's definitely weird. That's cool though, that your parents and siblings don't find it awkward. I definitely found it inconvenient to have to bring all my clothes into the bathroom when I showered, but kinda just took it as a given for living with other people. \n\nPrivacy was a big thing in our family. My parents never had it as kids, so they made sure we felt we had all the privacy that American kids get. That means you get your own bathroom time, you don't have to change your siblings' diaper, you're allowed to close your door, that kind of thing. It didn't really make me skittish, but I will admit I had trouble adjusting to locker rooms in middle school \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I guess we will never know", "Look dude I\u2019ve been harassed sexually by my brother and this is a red flag. Do you have a brother? Would you send an underwear picture to your sister you don\u2019t talk to often?", "I have seen my brothers in underwear. They have seen me too. They are the people I feel the most comfortable around.", "However. We don\u2019t have the full context. I\u2019m trying real hard to see it from all points here."]}
