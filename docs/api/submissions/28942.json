I'm sensitive to scents (some chemicals cause me to have asthma attacks).  Scents in other people's shampoo or detergent don't want as much and aren't a problem.  Hand soaps get washed off and aren't a problem.  What are a problem are scents that get sprayed (cologne, hair sprays...) and scents that get applied (lotions, for instance).  Also, scents that are deeply embedded into people's clothing (smoke, sachets...) are a problem.  So, if you try to avoid any scents that are sprayed, applied, or embedded, you should be fine to use scented shampoo and soap and laundry detergent.\n\nAlso, opening a window isn't going to make things better.  That just moves the air around.  The chemicals in a scent are still in the air.  I mean, maybe it slightly diffuses the scent, but at least for me, my reaction is to the chemicals used to create the artificial scent and once that's in the air, I usually have to reach for my inhaler.\n\nSo, my opinion.  If your office isn't scent-free, start using your usual bathing habits and products.  Because this woman is going to blame you regardless.", "Info: could it be your laundry soap?

It seemed I was the only one with a problem.\nMy solution was to hold my braid over my nose when I was near him, as my own hair products helped me cover the smell. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is you have done what you can, if she is still having issue, she needs to find her own way to address it.", "NTA.

If she needs accommodations that's for her to work out with her employer, not her coworker.  I seriously wonder what would happen if you just said you've switched to all unscented products so you're not the source of whatever is giving her a headache.  I'm betting you'll see her switch to someone else.  (Hint opening the windows when you come in isn't a reaction to any products.  It's a reaction to you.  I.e she's full of crap).  Unfortunately there's a ton of power tripping people who want to make their coworkers do X to feel better about themselves.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about the scent. If she was that sensitive, it would be impossible for her to work with other people.", " My money is on dryer sheets, laundry soap or deodorant \n\nNAH she just wants to breathe and you just want to be clean \n\nGood luck", "Migraines are horrible, and smells can definitely trigger them.
