I would just politely keep my distance and come up with my own solutions. You went above and beyond to try and accommodate her- what more can you do?!\n\nIf it\u2019s so bad for your coworker, responsibility is on them to find solutions especially since I\u2019m so certain you\u2019re not the only one using scented products. She can request moving desks, put on a mask or get a desk fan.", "NTA. I somehow doubt you smell enough to trigger her since the only other person she seems to have that issue with is another student.

I had that happen before and got direct with her, she stopped her pettiness.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou've tried, there's only so much you can do.", "NTA and I say that as someone who is HIGHLY sensitive to smells. I get migraines instantly from certain scents (looking at you artificial cinnamon and anything bath and body works), but I also recognize what is reasonable to ask of another person and what isn't. It sounds like she has unreasonable expectations of you at this point, and if she has an issue with your smell then *she* needs to find a solution for herself.", "NTA.

I have a very sensitive sense of smell, and I know there are others who have it way worse, and can't imagine being in their shoes, but it's not on you at this point to make sure their over-sensitivity isn't stimulated. \n\nThat being said, now I'm curious, is this a medical condition that a doctor can help? I'm lucky enough to work in a large, well-ventilated area, but when in close quarters, smells can be quite off-putting to me as well. Maybe something I should google.", "INFO: is there a difference in race/ethnicity etc?", "YWNBTA. You have made a very good faith effort.

See if the overlap can be cut or someone work in a different room etc.. \n\nI have severe chronic migraines that worsen based on scent and im allergic to most every scent under the sun. It is not on someone else to cater 100% I have to be proactive too. Even if it's changing shifts, working elsewhere till the scent goes, or talking with the individual to narrow down what it is they are wearing that is causing me issues. \n\nI wonder. Do you use oils, deodorants or lotions? Those could be what it's coming from. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  you are being accommodating enough though. \n\n\nIt sounds to me like she needs to get herself a painters mask that she wears during the time you are supposed to arrive until she leaves. \n\nThat is what I do. I wear it at work and at class. \n\nGood luck OP. \n\nIt might be good to write a list of things you use so it can be narrowed down.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you've been trying really hard and maybe this coworker is overly sensitive and can never be pleased.\n\nThat said, you may have been eliminating the wrong things.  I'm sensitive to scents (some chemicals cause me to have asthma attacks).  Scents in other people's shampoo or detergent don't want as much and aren't a problem.  Hand soaps get washed off and aren't a problem.  What are a problem are scents that get sprayed (cologne, hair sprays...) and scents that get applied (lotions, for instance).  Also, scents that are deeply embedded into people's clothing (smoke, sachets...) are a problem.  So, if you try to avoid any scents that are sprayed, applied, or embedded, you should be fine to use scented shampoo and soap and laundry detergent.\n\nAlso, opening a window isn't going to make things better.  That just moves the air around.  The chemicals in a scent are still in the air.  I mean, maybe it slightly diffuses the scent, but at least for me, my reaction is to the chemicals used to create the artificial scent and once that's in the air, I usually have to reach for my inhaler.\n\nSo, my opinion.  If your office isn't scent-free, start using your usual bathing habits and products.  Because this woman is going to blame you regardless.", "Info: could it be your laundry soap? I had a coworker where that was the issue, once. \n\nYou could also suggest the business buy a HEPA filter for by her desk/work space.", "NTA! I was like your coworker once. I had a supervisor who liked to wear Old Spice Hawksridge. I know this because I thought the commercial was funny enough to buy the deodorant for myself .\n\nIt reeked and I threw it out. \n\nUnfortunately I was not able to convince my supervisor to do the same. It seemed I was the only one with a problem.\nMy solution was to hold my braid over my nose when I was near him, as my own hair products helped me cover the smell. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is you have done what you can, if she is still having issue, she needs to find her own way to address it.", "NTA. Just tell her you aren't wearing any scent and you never do at work. You have to wash your hair.", "NTA.  She's seriously overreaching.  If she needs accommodations that's for her to work out with her employer, not her coworker.  I seriously wonder what would happen if you just said you've switched to all unscented products so you're not the source of whatever is giving her a headache.  I'm betting you'll see her switch to someone else.  (Hint opening the windows when you come in isn't a reaction to any products.  It's a reaction to you.  I.e she's full of crap).  Unfortunately there's a ton of power tripping people who want to make their coworkers do X to feel better about themselves.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about the scent. If she was that sensitive, it would be impossible for her to work with other people.", " My money is on dryer sheets, laundry soap or deodorant \n\nNAH she just wants to breathe and you just want to be clean \n\nGood luck", "Migraines are horrible, and smells can definitely trigger them.  But you're not wearing scents.  You're just washing your hair.  Maybe it's your soap?\n\nIf there is a way to not bother her, you should do it.  But I can't see how you can do it and be hygienic.", "When my stepdaughter came to visit one summer, she had started to use Aussie Shampoo and Conditioner.\n\nThose products made me so sick and asthmatic  that I had to beg her to put the containers outside. I gave her money to purchase other products, which I thankfully was able to tolerate.\n\nI'm surprised you and the coworker haven't chatted more specifically about which products could be bothering her. Not shampooing for a few days is not a solution.\n\nYou could bring in your products and try to narrow down which ones are making her ill. \n\nThen, have a conversation about not using, not wearing, or replacing the product.", "NTA.  You've already done way more than you should've.  Not washing your hair just to appease your co-worker is insane to me.  Tons of people have sensitivities to scents or noises, it's on them to deal with it, not on you. If it's affecting her work she should ask to be moved to a different part of the office or find a new job.  Tell her to rub some Vicks under her nose and call it day.", "Her problem. You tried.", "When you have this sensitivity it can make you wish you were dead. \nIt's HORRIBLE. Please do keep trying. \nI don't think either of you is an AH.\nI just know it's hard to understand what other people are thinking and going through.", "I feel so bad for you. You aren't smart enough to figure out how to stop using product that is physically hurting someone you work with. To have to go through life that stupid will be sheer torture. Not torture like getting migraines from perfumed products, which is excruciating agony, you'll just be clueless and uncaring. And physically causing people around you serious pain. But making a small change in yout routine is obviously more than anyone should ever expect. It is all about you after all.\n\nYTA\n\nI, like your coworker, am extremely senstive to perfumed products (actually, it's the glycol used as a carrier of the perfume) You have no concept of what it's like to know that the place you work is a place you will be subjected to the thing that gives you intense physical pain and the people who are causing this, who you've told about your need, find it just exasperating that they are being asked to not cause you this pain. Do you use skin moisturizer? Does it have glycol in it? How about the body wash you shower with. It's really not that hard. You just have to care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not an issue with you, it\u2019s an issue with HER, particularly as you\u2019re not the only one she has complained unreasonably to/about. It sounds like you\u2019ve been quite accommodating, going above and beyond what a lot of people would. Workplaces must make what\u2019s called \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d with issues like this or disabilities, but the key word is \u201creasonable\u201d. It is unreasonable of her to expect you and others in your workplace to be totally scent free, there\u2019s just no way of doing so. Usually a reasonable accommodation is asking co-workers if they\u2019d mind not wearing perfume/cologne or one specific product that bothers the person, however by law you can\u2019t be forced to not wear it  If she can\u2019t work in the workplace with the accommodations you\u2019ve made(which tbh were maybe a bit easier on you since you already don\u2019t wear a lot of scents) like avoiding washing your hair the day before work, you need to go to HR or your direct management and file a complaint. If the other student is willing, you could also give their name to be contacted as someone the woman has displayed similar behavior to.
