I'm sensitive to scents (some chemicals cause me to have asthma attacks).  Scents in other people's shampoo or detergent don't want as much and aren't a problem.  Hand soaps get washed off and aren't a problem.  What are a problem are scents that get sprayed (cologne, hair sprays...) and scents that get applied (lotions, for instance).  Also, scents that are deeply embedded into people's clothing (smoke, sachets...) are a problem.  So, if you try to avoid any scents that are sprayed, applied, or embedded, you should be fine to use scented shampoo and soap and laundry detergent.\n\nAlso, opening a window isn't going to make things better.  That just moves the air around.  The chemicals in a scent are still in the air.  I mean, maybe it slightly diffuses the scent, but at least for me, my reaction is to the chemicals used to create the artificial scent and once that's in the air, I usually have to reach for my inhaler.\n\nSo, my opinion.  If your office isn't scent-free, start using your usual bathing habits and products.  Because this woman is going to blame you regardless.", "Info: could it be your laundry soap?

It seemed I was the only one with a problem.\nMy solution was to hold my braid over my nose when I was near him, as my own hair products helped me cover the smell. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is you have done what you can, if she is still having issue, she needs to find her own way to address it.", "NTA.

If she needs accommodations that's for her to work out with her employer, not her coworker.  I seriously wonder what would happen if you just said you've switched to all unscented products so you're not the source of whatever is giving her a headache.  I'm betting you'll see her switch to someone else.  (Hint opening the windows when you come in isn't a reaction to any products.  It's a reaction to you.  I.e she's full of crap).  Unfortunately there's a ton of power tripping people who want to make their coworkers do X to feel better about themselves.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about the scent.

I stopped her in her tracks when I said, \"Oh my, how do you get on for finding latex-free underwear?\"  She didn't have an answer and just stared at me in disbelief.  Obviously she was not truly allergic as a normal person would have immediately told the truth and said that something like they needed to buy specific brands or that they have their underwear custom-made.  But she was lost for words, which indicates to me that she wasn't able to think quickly enough to come up with a convincing lie.  Thankfully she chose to leave the workplace after a couple of weeks.", "100% a power move. OP and the other student are dealing with that from her but seemingly none of the other employees are? There\u2019s no shot that every single person in that office has stopped using anything scented in their day-to-day lives because of their coworker.", "I was like your coworker once. I had a supervisor who liked to wear Old Spice Hawksridge. I know this because I thought the commercial was funny enough to buy the deodorant for myself .", "Unfortunately it's not a power move. \nIt's MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity), and I know because I have it. \nThat being said, I go to great lengths to make sure that other people don't have to change anything about their life/products they use, as it is MY condition/problem. Not others'.", "Yeah. Even if we assume the coworker isn\u2019t being malicious (and I wonder tbh, as it seems she\u2019s going over the top and also has the same issue with the other student\u2026) there are reasonable adjustments/accommodations and there\u2019s whatever this is. \n\nPersonally I think this smacks of a power play/bullying on this woman\u2019s part.", "Oh yeah, I get migraines from lavender, that shit is in *everything*, the pandemic and therefore masking has been a blessing on that front, I\u2019ve not gotten a single migraine or asthma attack from some random person\u2019s perfume since 2020", "I'm allergic to artificial cinnamon, so I feel your pain. NTA, OP.", "I'm also highly sensitive to fragrances and get migrains and nausea. I also have contact allergies toward certain fragrances/ingredients. Most of my items are fragrance free or, barring that, a scent I have used for years and painstakingly built up a tolerance to.\n\nYou know what I do when someone in the office puts on a scented lotion? I leave the office for a few minutes until the smell fades a bit. You know what I don't do? Unilaterally tell them they aren't allowed to use scented products. It is my problem to figure out how to live in a world where fragrances exist and I cannot expect to always avoid them.", "This was my thought", "No. We\u2019re both white women.", "My laundry soap and deodorant are all scent free and approved by the National asthma and allergy foundation in my country. I also don\u2019t use lotions or oils that aren\u2019t approved by them. It\u2019s just my shampoo, because their shampoo is murder on my hair.", "This.", "Did you not read the post? They said they don\u2019t use anything scented. Like literally flat out said it. I\u2019d suggest actually reading before you make a comment", "This is a LOT of accommodation to make for a coworker and quite frankly its not OPs responsibility. OP took more than reasonable measures to try and work it out. If it is STILL an issue then this seems to be approaching a level of disability that it's the company's responsibility to figure out a work around for.\n\nIf a person is being clean and hygienic and has taken reasonable measures to accommodate a coworker, that coworker doesn't have the right to dictate further how that person bathes. The fact that you think it's reasonable to suggest that OP to bring in all her grooming products for a coworker to approve just absolutely boggles my mind.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Underwear don't contain latex. Elastic is made of rubber, and they used spandex for stretch. Yes you caught her in a lie, but you are misinformed.", "It\u2019s highly unlikely, but maybe her answer is to not wear underwear, which she didn\u2019t want to say at work. I know it\u2019s very unlikely in this case, but just because someone doesn\u2019t answer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are lying.", "Maybe she was appalled at your very personal question? If you had asked me that question (also allergic to latex) I would have been slow to answer because I would have been biting my tongue so as not to give an equally rude response.", "I suggest you Google latex underwear, lol.  I would also stare in disbelief if you asked me this at work!", "Floral fragrances are my typical trigger.  And lavender does seem to be everywhere!", "I break out in hives when even near those holiday pine cones and brooms.", "I am allergic to many fragrances.  But artificial cinnamon is one of the worst offenders.  As the end of summer approaches I dread the arrival of the scented brooms and pine cones as stores push the fall season.  And when I finally enter a store and smell the \u201ccinnamon\u201d my heart sinks and my thought is \u201cAlready???\u201d", "I assume you tried washing your hair with one of those unscented shampoos one day to see if she claims that also bothers her? Maybe do a apple cider vinegar rinse on your hair - it would help strip out fragrances, and soften your hair. Of course, then you smell a little vinegary. I'm very bothered by fragrances and shampoo can definitely cause problems because those fragrance chemicals really linger. If she's still bothered though after the above suggestions though, she's maybe just malingering.", "Ideally, clothes with fabric softener on them shouldn't be put in a dryer (it's a fire risk).\n\nI've had reactions to people's perfumes in the oast but only when they were wearing excessive amounts of perfume & i was required to sit in close proximity for over an hour.

The person opened some windows  Lots of people are not safe going to a supervisor.

Floral is definitely the worst offender for me. One of the only floral fragrances I have found that doesn't produce a terrible reaction is lilac.", "Most supervisors have basically no training at supervision and they often make tensions much worse. They are not taught to know anything about meeting people\u2019s access needs. They\u2019re just a stressed person with a tiny bit of power and pressure from above to make a profit.
