We had the time we had, and it\u2019s over, I don\u2019t see anything sad about that.", "And both are perfectly fine. My mum was my best friend and when she passed, even though we knew it was happening since she was sick, it was the worst pain I've ever experienced in my entire life. It's been 2.5 years and I'm still deep in mourning. But my feelings in losing my parent isn't more valid than anyone else's. I don't think it's a cause for concern because someone else doesn't grieve like I do, you know?

Obviously we don't know anything of OP beyond what they posted.  It is possible that their girlfriend is noticing subtle shifts in their behavior, or maybe they've developed an unhealthy habit as a subconscious coping mechanism.

I only light a yahrtzeit candle when my mom prompts me.\n\nBut I talk about  him a lot, at times, when at dinner with my family or on the phone with his sister...", "Do you not tend to form emotional bonds strongly, by any chance? Like, if a friend fucks you over, are you able to cut them off easily without having to agonize over the decision? Do you get annoyed or confused by social obligations that you don't think are necessary, but that other people seem to find very important? Have you found yourself baffled by most people having emotional reactions to something that you see as not a big deal or illogical, especially when that thing is related to relationships?\n\nSome people just naturally don't form emotional bonds as strongly as others do, and then are baffled by people's reactions who do, and the people who do are baffled by those people's reactions. It's not a bad thing to be either way, but it is important to understand because otherwise it can cause conflicts where people are talking past each other or making assumptions about others' experiences. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 recently learned that he has impaired relational bonding, and he said that it felt like a lot of mysteries were suddenly solved for him-- things that he wondered about other people's behavior that seemed illogical to him, that he couldn't understand because he didn't know that they were flooded with an emotion that he's never experienced like that. It's not a problem for us-- he loves me because he loves me, not because his body is producing the physical signals that other people experience when forming bonds-- but it's nice for him to realize because it helps him understand other people's behavior better, and it helps me understand his thinking better. Now that I know that he's lacking a biological drive that other people have, I can be more accurate and understanding when discussing obligations and explaining activities related to bonding. \n\nOf course, grief can manifest differently even in people who create strong emotional bonds. My Gran died years ago, and I was devastated and angry. But my Grampy died just recently, and I haven't really been sad. The difference is that Gran died too soon, from an illness that should have been caught earlier; while Grampy died after a long illness, having done everything he wanted to do and spent time reminiscing and concluded he was ready to go. Gran wasn't ready to go; Grampy was. And that's a huge difference. So my emotional bonds have caused me to have different emotional reactions in the two situations.\n\nSo it's not necessarily the case that you don't form emotional bonds strongly; grieving can happen very differently, or not at all, based on circumstances. But I thought it was at least worth bringing up.", "Exactly what I was thinking.  \n\n\nAs to remark about being on the spectrum, the pragmatic acceptance of death is a \"feature\". I (67m) am HFA. I can simply accept people dying as that is what everyone does.  \n\n\nIn an odd way, you possibly care more than most as you can see all that is going on. You process it, understand it, move along.   \n\n\nThat your GF has specific requirements for how you should behave, emotionally, is disturbing.   \n\n\nAs I said to a friend, when her husband was in a long term death spiral (insert long story) \"What ever you do, is right\". She did right.  \n\n\nYou are doing right.", "Without any real information of what she's doing and saying, specifically, it's unfair to label her behavior as \"disturbing\".\n\nShe could be genuinely concerned that OP is bottling all this up, or it just could be difficult for her to process that someone is as nonchalant about their mother dying, especially if she is close to her mother. OP doesn't disclose his girlfriend's age, so she might not be mature enough to handle this type of situation.", "I was trying to find the words to say exactly this.", "I'm planning on making my funeral a huge party.

It all depends on the circumstances, really. If someone is already old or quite ill, it's not that uncommon for loved ones to take it more in stride.

He was old and he had gone through a lot of pain, it was a relief that he wouldn't suffer anymore.

Your relationship with your mother is your own, and if you had already been mentally preparing for some time for her to be gone, then your reaction isn't one to cause me any concern.\n\nMy dad died very unexpectedly at home (he was only mid50s, but had been morbidly obese for most of his adult life and ended up having a heart attack in his sleep). I woke up to my mother screaming for me to call 911, but he was gone. I was sad, of course, but I was raised with the knowledge and expectation that he wouldn't be around forever. I'm sad he had to miss milestones (like he never saw any of his kids get married or meet grandkids), but him being gone now doesn't make the time we shared less important. Kids grow up, parents die.

My mum died and I was a mess ha ha", "NTA. Everyone deals with loss in their own way. You were mentally prepared for it. You made peace with it, and it sounds like there was nothing left unsaid, undone, and that is such a blessing. Perhaps they are projecting their closest experience with loss and just can\u2019t wrap their head around it because they didn\u2019t have the same sense of acceptance. \n\nI think maybe you could just say that your \u2018aloofness\u2019 is not any reflection with how much you loved your mom, it\u2019s just a testament to how well your mother nurtured and prepared you for life without her.", "My dad was sick for a very long time, so his death wasn't upsetting so much as a relief.

I still had a random couple of people wonder why I wasn't crying more.\n\nPeople get weird about death and tend to project.\n\nNAH, but maybe it wasn't what you said but how you said it? That said, it's been more than 10 years but I'll still get random bouts of mild sadness that I can't share something with him. It's ok to feel things about her death, even if it's not a major thing or on a timeline that differs from someone else's expectations.", "So you\u2019re not upset that the one person who loved you unconditionally and in the only one specific way a person who birthed you could is dead?\nOk, well your girlfriend certainly doesn\u2019t love you the same way. Her love is conditional, she is judging you hard and is probably rethinking staying with you because she can\u2019t relate to your lack of feelings for your own mother.  And she\u2019s thinking what the fuck are you going to be like as a parent.  One of your kids dies\u2026 it\u2019s ok, everyone dies. We\u2019re young enough to have another?"]}
