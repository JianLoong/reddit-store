He has come over a lot in the past couple days and I feel like he really needs me right now. \n\nThe funeral was yesterday and I had assumed I would be sitting next to him for support and because I didn\u2019t know anyone else. Traditionally it is the immediate family that sits together up front but he told me that I am basically family to him because we know we are getting married sometime in the next year. So it was him, his dad, his brother, his brothers wife, and me. Nobody said anything about it so I assumed it was okay. And, I made sure to stay out of about 90% of the family pictures and give them their space during more intimate parts of the service. \n\nWell, now a bunch of his families friends and extended family are gossiping about it and I feel bad.

You have been dating for nearly four years, you have supported him emotionally through this entire ordeal. Your bf is in what we call the first ring of grief: he is among those most affected.

Personally, I just attended my partner's mother's memorial, and I sat in the back wearing a mask because I was sick and his family is all elderly.

OP, You were respecting your grieving boyfriend's wishes. Whoever is whining about their bizarre protocol has ABSOLUTELY no say regarding seating arrangements.

Please ignore them.", "NTA. When my mum died my boyfriend was sitting next to me (he is now my husband) and I literally sobbed into him the entire time. I couldn't have done it without him.

Is that a regional thing?  A cultural thing?  \n\n\nAnyway, NTA.  He wanted you there and you wanted to be there and that's basically all that matters.

I then told my dad, who asked his wife (stepmom) and she said she didn't want me to bring her. Ok no problem.\n\nOP's bf should have consulted with family first. This isn't a BBQ or birthday party. This is a time of mourning for family and those close to the deceased.

Let them be small minded, nothing you can do about. Same happened to me, albeit on a smaller scale. Went with my now husband to his grandmother's funeral after almost a year of dating. Tried sitting next to him in the car over to the cemetery after the viewing, got crowded out by young cousins so his grandfather who was driving asked me to sit up front with him, talk & keep him company. I did, he was lonely obviously and sad but very kind to me. I was meeting a lot of family at a sad time, so I really appreciated how kind his grandfather was & was glad to be able to give him some company in his grief. \n\nBut one of my husbands cousins glared daggers at me for \"daring\" to ride up front with her grandfather, and refused to even speak to me when my now husband introduced us.

Your boyfriend specifically asked you to sit next to him.", "NTA - you didn't attend the funeral for them, you attended because you wanted to be there to support your SO in his time of grief. Kinda hard to support someone when you aren't anywhere near them.", "NTA. \n\nWhy is this even an issue? Are the family members upset because you had a better seat than they did? I mean, seriously, why is this even a topic of discussion for these people? You were there to support your boyfriend. He wanted you there to support him.
