I contact them and they explain there's a HR issue.  Another half a week goes by and finally HR get in touch to say that I have to reapply for my DBS and send them some docs before I start. I apply, and they request a scan of my birth certificate, degree, DBS and 2 references. I provide them all straight away. 3 days later I get a voicemail from HR saying (and I quote) \"I understand that you don't feel it's important to provide these documents, but it's for the safety of the children.\" I call and explain I have already sent them. She checks her emails and sees that I have, then decides that she also needs a scan of my passport, license, proof of address and full employment history and I need to bring the docs in to be sighted \"by someone\". \n\nI send everything. The next day she sends an email where she's copied in my bosses, and marked URGENT!!! and then berated me for not providing the docs that she'd never asked for fast enough. She also had a go at me for not booking a meeting with my new boss to show him the documents, despite never telling me I needed to do this. She apparently couldn't accept my employment history as it was in a CV in a word doc, so it needed to be pasted into another word doc without the CV part with justifications for every 2 week gap. It's worth noting that every 2 week employment gap I've had since graduating has been a result of this specific HR rep fucking up my references or employment checks.\n\nAgain, I do everything she asks. Show up for the meeting with the boss only to find the building empty. I eventually track them down the next day and they check all my documents. This morning I wake up to an email from HR rep saying that I'm being deliberately difficult and delaying my own start because I've provided a proof of address doc that isn't good enough.
