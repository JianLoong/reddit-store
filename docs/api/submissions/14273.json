Doesn't matter the age of the child you are being paid to watch the child through and through. It doesn't matter what parents do with their child you're not them.

A nap or falling asleep completely is not unwarranted. The kid was fine. The whole point of a babysitter is to have an adult/older responsible teenager in the house for emergencies.

Anyone who has been a parent has taken naps while watching kids.", "NTA", "NTA the point of a babysitter is to be there to care for the child in case of emergency and be there to respond if needed, with both alarms and monitors you are definitely going to wake up to attend if/when needed, you don't need to be awake to do that, any parent would expect overnight sitters to get some sleep.", "Nta. Does your bf think parents are like night watchmen?", "NTA. I'm a nanny, and sometimes I'll sleep if the baby is napping.
