Heck, as a 50 hour/week nanny I used to make the kids be in their rooms for 1 hour per day at the same time midday so \\*I and they\\* could recharge, including sometimes a short nap for me. The rule was they didn\u2019t have to take a nap (though they often did), but they needed to have 1 hour quiet time in their own room.  I did this on a couch I could see their bedroom doors from, so it only took about a week of \u201ctraining \u201c before they knew even sticking a toe out would be noticed and them redirected back to quiet time. I attended the wedding of one of those kids recently and he remarked that while he had great memories of me in general as a nanny, he specifically remembered and really appreciated that regular down/alone/quiet time and said it taught him the importance of having that regularly to recharge even as an adult. At first I thought he was joking me but he was really sincere.", "If you take all the precautions and the child is asleep then I don\u2019t see why it\u2019d be a problem honestly the parents sleep at some point when they are taking care of the baby", "lol, as soon as the kid was out, i would have been too.  nta.  bf has never watched kids obviously.", "NTA.

You guys are awesome but there are some who are not and we have to follow our contracts. For safety I just wouldn't.
