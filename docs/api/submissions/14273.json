Also have a bonus daughter in my oldest son's little sister that's 11, her dad wasn't around so my wife and I become her \"step parents\" and she spent just as much time with us as my oldest. I never expected a babysitter to stay up on an overnight or late night stay. It's ridiculous to think otherwise.", "Yep, you caught me. I'm woefully ignorant of the term. Terribly so. Please save me from my ignorant ways with your superior intellect, kind internet stranger!", "It\u2019s completely normal for babysitters to take quick naps late at night when the kids are asleep. I\u2019ve never babysat and not had the parents encourage it. Yes you are absolutely there to ensure safety, just like parents are. There\u2019s literally no reason why you can\u2019t doze off for 20 minutes late at night with a baby monitor. It\u2019s completely unreasonable to expect a babysitter to be more attentive than the literal parents are. You\u2019re being dramatic.", "i think op is able to hear a baby cry just fine she won't be as in tune as the parents though. is that not a given? i do snow removal in the winter time i sometimes have to pull 30 hour shifts. if the weather calms down for an hour or two i do indeed sleep in the truck. if i work away from home on an industrial scale i do 16 hour days eat and sleep for 8 and back at it. best part is i get paid to sleep! tons of people sleep on the job and sleeping does not mean you're irresponsible as long as the proper duties are done. i really don't think a man who i'm assuming hasn't had to take care of babies long term should have much of an opinion on how to take care of a strangers baby.", "Are you on your period?", "Do us all a favour and delete your account...thank you", "Dramatic? You just added a bunch of garbage that wasn't in the post.\nWhat is the point of a baby sitter?\nAt what age can one be Responsible enough to be left in charge. Note the word responsible.", "Put it this way, if you hired a babysitter and came home to the death or injury etc.. to your baby and asked the sitter what happened and they said \"I don't know, I was sleeping\" how would you react?", "Long story of BS that is far from common....30hr shift, how does that compare to a babysitting stint?\nThe exception doesn't negate the rule.\nGood for you being an adult and working like the rest of us, not sure why you seek recognition on line for having a job.", "I surely need to, thank you for the much needed advice. I do not know how I would've functioned without it today. Consider it deleted my friend.", "Facts from the post \n1. Baby was asleep\n2. Baby monitor was on\n3. It was late, 11pm\n4. It was a quick 20 minute nap\n\nThere\u2019s nothing unusual at all about that, very typical for babysitters to take quick naps late at night when kids are asleep. So yeah, you\u2019re being dramatic af", "Now you got it...you haven't been  functioning. Thanks", "If something happened and it was your kid and the sitter said she doesn't know what happened...how would you react?\nI think I would HIRE someone who could stay awake or don't take the job.\nI doubt it was 20minutes , she fell a sleep, so how does she know for sure."]}
