I have been babysitting for a long time and have often taken naps while the kids nap or have done overnight where my job is to sleep over to make sure kids are alright overnight.

Parents don\u2019t take shifts at night to make sure someone is awake at all times - they sleep.

MOST children spend some time without any awake supervisors each night.\n\nBecause when a child is in distress..... people STOP being asleep.", "NTA parents sleep. You set a timer which I\u2019m not even sure that was necessary. You Had baby monitor by your head. Jeeze. As a young adult, I babysat plenty. Kids go down, babysitter can sleep. We didn\u2019t have timers and monitors. Woke up when parents got home. No one ever thought that was unreasonable, nor unsafe.", "As long as the door was locked and the kid had no other issues, like autism, that might cause them to wake up suddenly and run off - NTA.\n\nYoung kids sleep often. I don't think it's a crime to sleep when they are, with all those precautions you took.", "The baby has been asleep for a few hours. NTA for a 20 min nap.", "NTA\n\n\n\n... does he think parents take turns and are awake all night just watching the  kid? \n\n\nWhat does he think happens to make it deeply unsafe?", "NTA.

As long as baby is safe and you have the monitor turned on to the max you\u2019re fine.", "NTA I'm a parent. I sleep when my child is asleep. Think your boyfriend will find that's what humans do.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you think parents do at night? Stay awake just in case the baby does? NO.

In the middle of the night it's a given that people would be sleeping. The point of a babysitter is to have someone older and responsible there with your child, if they're sleeping when the kid si sleeping it's fine.", "How much does BF make babysitting, EVER?

Regardless of what you have in place unless the parent okay it and even then don't take the risk. I've have parents offer me blankets and say I could use the extra bed and nap with the child absolutely not. It's a liability. Your bf is right it is unsafe and parents can do 360. Doesn't matter the age of the child you are being paid to watch the child through and through. It doesn't matter what parents do with their child you're not them. I'm a parent myself and no you can't sleep on the job. If you're tired cancel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A nap or falling asleep completely is not unwarranted. The kid was fine. The whole point of a babysitter is to have an adult/older responsible teenager in the house for emergencies. That's why kids who can reasonably entertain themselves when they're older (like 8) still have babysitters."]}
