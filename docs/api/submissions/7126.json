But those are just my thoughts, there are millions of people who are better than me and I respect that. It just encourages me to keep doing it. \n\nEmily decided recently to start an art account on some social medias, and start drawing more. I feel like her art is really good, but she has super high standards. She is always comparing herself to really popular artists/animators (think Typh, Sashley, SolarSaber etc.) and complains constantly about it. \n\nI don\u2019t follow her account, so this is why I didn\u2019t know about this til now. \n\nAround a week ago I made a piece of digital art of my main character that I was proud of, so I posted it, with my watermark on the side of the main part of the image. Yesterday, a newish follower dm\u2019d me a post saying \u201cIsn\u2019t this yours?\u201d. The post they sent was from Emily\u2019s account, but it looked like she reset her account (like deleted all her original posts). The post had the art that I made, but she edited out my watermark and posted it as hers. \n\nMy art style changed from the last time I drew so people didn\u2019t notice at first that it was mine. I thanked the follower and dm\u2019d Emily to ask her to take down the post. She refused saying that I was somehow being greedy for doing both traditional and digital, and it wasn\u2019t fair that I have more followers than her because of it. Wtf???\n\nI tried putting a comment on the post saying that I was the original artist but she kept deleting them. I also noticed that she was posting other peoples art also, but they were smaller artists so they weren\u2019t known enough for people to notice. \n\nI reported Emily\u2019s posts, account and made a post calling her out on it.

Your cousin is greedy. \nShe will never be able to find her footing in life if she's going to keep comparing herself to others and claiming their art as her own. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA! She stole your (and other artists) art and now she\u2019s throwing a hissy fit over it? What an entitled asshole", "NTA but I want to caution you on this family dynamic. Your aunt and Emily are not capable of recognizing that they are the problem. Just based on your post you are already developmentally ahead of both of them, and this will probably never change.\n\nIf maintaining a relationship with them is important, then get your own family on board and spend time explaining the situation. You may need their support.\n\nOtherwise, block them both and move on with your life. You have an excellent mindset and will continue to grow. Also, anyone who tells you that art is not a career path is an ass. Good luck!", "NTA you aunt and cousin are AH", "Clearly NTA. Artists have a hard enough time without having to worry about their own family stealing their art. There is nothing wrong with calling her out on something so blatant. If anything this is a case of reap what you sow and your cousin is the one who decided to steal your hard work. They should be apologizing to you. Also it\u2019s pretty gross that that your adult cousin ran to her mom to get her to help gang up on you with her . It goes along with the whole not taking responsibility for her own actions issue and in this case she is finally facing some repercussions. If she starts another account and does the same thing report it again. Since you have two adult women harassing you I think should go ahead and get your parents involved and let them know what is going on if you haven\u2019t already so they can help.", "NTA, report it as it should be reported.   \nArt theft is still theft. And should be handeld as such!", "NTA. Fight for your work. Report theft. Grass is green. The sun sets in the west. These things will never change.", "NTA!  Nothing more despicable than stealing or copying someone else's work and attempting to claim it as your own!  It's illegal!  Good for you on standing up for yourself and for other original artists out there who's work she was also trying to steal!\n\nYour aunt needs to look in the mirror, then look at her own daughter and ask herself how she raised her child to be a dishonest and disrespectful soul.  Shame on both of them!\n\nYou did the right thing, and exposed her for the phony she is.", "NTA. Does your aunt know the full story? If she isn't aware of it I could imagine Emily phrasing it as 'She got a bunch of people to hate me and ban my account for no reason'. What she did is break the law, steal other people's work and take credit for talent she didn't create.", "NTA; i\u2019m a freelance graphic designer and illustrator by trade and you did the right thing. I know someone I went to high school with who has a degree in graphic design but still routinely traces other peoples work and denies it; it\u2019s genuinely embarrassing and only going to hurt her career in the long run.", "NTA\n\nArt theft is theft. She was in violation of your copyright as well as others. So she was breaking the law. \n\nThat is a ToS violation on pretty much every platform. \n\nShe should be glad she hasn't made money from it, because then you would have further grounds to sue for copyright infringement, and you would win.", "NTA She is just mad she got caught.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
