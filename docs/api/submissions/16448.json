Differing financial expectations are likely to lead to a breakup", "INFO:\n\n1. What kind of debts are these?

Rather, I think that he is complaining about the fact that she received a sum of money and instead of thinking of putting part of it into something related to the couple, she thought of putting all of it into something that benefits her on her own. I think that Op would have been pleased to hear that she was willing to put 50 dollars for the wedding. In my opinion, it's not about money, it's about thought. Op said that he helped her pay off some of her debts and that he pays most of the bills but he also said that he has no problem with that. And from the post it appears that he is the only one who is struggling to make a budget for the wedding, even though he may feel that financially he does everything for the wedding (and he really does) and he would probably like to hear that she would be willing to help. Considering that he helped her pay off part of her debts, I don't think he would have used the money for the wedding. I think he was more bothered by the fact that he is struggling to make a budget for both of them and she doesn't think to help even though she has more money now", "Yeah, YTA, but minorly. She was using the money to pay off debts, not to buy herself something nice or something. And she makes a third of the money you do? Cut her a bit of slack.\n\nI do think she overreacted by assuming you don't want her family at the wedding. And weddings can be expensive and stressful times. When you can, sit down and talk to her about this.\n\nAlso if you want her to put some money toward the wedding, that's not an unreasonable request, but you need to talk about it without acting like she's not doing her part.", "Do you know the full extent of her debt?", "INFO: what kind of luxuries do you buy. Is it some clothes, because you can't walk naked? Or do you regularly buy expensive designer handbags for her.", "Question: Was the money from her auntie specifically for the wedding? \n\nI don't think your issue is her not contributing, it is her not talking to you about money decisions or telling you about money received from alternate sources.  Do you not believe all the money went to debt?", "NTA. The gift was for the wedding, aka for the both of you. She used it on herself without discussing it with you. It doesn't matter what she used the money for, the fact is that she spend money that was intended for the both of you on herself. That alone makes her TA.", "Ok so. NTA for this and her turning on the water works, not telling you about the money and taking your money to pay of her debts that it sounds like she had before you got together sounds manipulative. \n\nYou sound like you are going above and beyond here. She should have told you about the money and when are her debts goings to be paid off? \n\nYou have to be able to talk about money without someone bursting into tears. This is coming from someone who earns double what her partner does. We talk about money all the time as things change.", "NTA - you make a reasonable comment about economic issue and she starts crying and twists your words so it's about you not liking her family? Either she is extremely insecure and emotional, or she's delibiterately guilt tripping and manipulating you to shut down any conversation about te finances. Please take a long discussion regarding this before getting married.", "It\u2019s not like she used the $1500 to buy something frivolous, she used it to pay off debt; which , given you\u2019ll be merging your finances through marriage, is in the best interests of you BOTH", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like she is using you. This happened with my aunt and her now ex husband. She bank rolled him and paid off of his debts, and well, he is an ex for a reason. I would really consider whether she is someone you want to marry, she doesn\u2019t sound very realistic.", "NTA.\n\nPlease try to sit her down and show her the entire wedding budget + honeymoon: show her how much extra guest cost; Ask her how are you BOTH going to cover this extra cost; Offer her to delay the honeymoon until you are BOTH financially more stable and can contribute to it, and use part of the budget to cover extra guest. \n\nBased on how it goes, you may have to rethink the wedding.\n\nINFO: How big is her remaining debt?", "It does not sound as though the financial situation is unfair, but the two of you really, really need to have a long, careful, thoughtful conversation about how your finances work. Using her money to pay off debts may well be the best thing to do, but you are obviously feeling somewhat hard done by with regard to the wedding. Money can become a real problem within a marriage, so the two of you need to be very clear on how your mutual finances are going to work.  (Incidentally, it might be a less emotionally charged issue if both of you pay an agreed-upon proportion of your earnings into a joint account which is then used to pay the mortgage and other household bills.)\n\nAlso, you both need to get clarification on the wedding itself. How many guests can you afford, that kind of detail. Because if she is just spending the money without reference to the wedding budget, she isn't being responsible. However, if you are - or, she believes you are - restricting 'her' guests unreasonably while allowing yourself to invite more, this is something that will fester.  Perhaps she comes from a larger family than you, and is chafing at the need to exclude people?\n\nI can see that you tried to have this conversation and your fianc\u00e9e became over-emotional and wouldn't have it. But the conversation needs to happen.\n\nNAH", "NTA. The $1500 dollars her aunt sent was for the wedding. It was wrong that she used that money on her debt   It is not fair that you are having to pay for everything and she sounds self centered", "I think we need to ask what are her \u201cdebts?\u201d Is it from student loans, a car loan, what? If it\u2019s those then you\u2019re slightly the TA. If she\u2019s out shopping and racking up a CC bill and then paying it off, that\u2019s different and NTA for sure. How long have you been giving her $500 a month and again, what is the amount and source of debt?", "Nta. How far in debt is she?", "You have bigger issues, my friend, than just wondering about who's being the asshole here.\n\nYou and your fiance haven't even worked out how you're planning on doing money, and yet the wedding is already coming up?\n\nNTA for talking about money.\n\nBut, heading for a trainwreck?  Yes.  Just based on the little information you gave out, in your shoes, I would postpone.  Plus, separately, why did you start supporting this person you just met?\n\n$500 a month for 3 years is $18,000.  Plus $1,500 from the aunt.  That's nearly $20k.  What kind of debt is this person in??", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t marry someone who is so into debt and would emotionally blackmail me into getting her way.", "NTA. She's asking you about how much you have set aside for wedding and honeymoon, and has $1500 fall into her lap and doesn't think twice about spending it all on her debt. Not a single thought about putting any of it towards the wedding. You've been paying down her debt this whole time and it just sounds like she doesn't reciprocate. Then she throws the \"I pay half the mortgage\" at you even though you pay everything else, and then resorts to using tears to make you feel bad.", "So your fiance's aunt sent her $1500 that she spent and now she wants her aunt to be invited and you must cover her aunt's expenses?\n\nNTA\n\nShe must cover her aunt's expenses.\n\nAlso you need to talk about finances more because you are not on the same page.\n\nEither you share all your money or you keep them separate and you definetly should talk before the wedding.\n\nRight now you're giving her $500, paying the rest (more than half) of the mortgage, all the bills and groceries, all the other luxuries, wedding and honeymoon expenses.\n\nMeanwhile you have no idea what she really does with her money. \n\nI think you should make your budget(s) together and talk about how much debt each had when you started dating and how much is left now.\n\nIt seems like you suspect there's something that she isn't saying...\n\nAlso you should know before marriage if your money are her money and her money are only her money.", "NTA\n\nShe cried, blamed you, and then stormed off to manipulate you and turn you into the villain.\n\nShe\u2019s been incredibly selfish tbh, and I think you need to work these money issues out now, before you get married, otherwise you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.", "YTA - how each couple handles finances is up to them\u2026\n\nBut logically, if your fianc\u00e9 earns 1/4 of the household income (which is what it would be if you earn 3x her); strictly she should only be paying 1/4 of the household expenses. If she is paying more than 1/4 of the household expenses, there is a bigger strain on her than you and it would justify her keeping the $1500 she received from her aunt. Seems you are holding your financial strength over her head which makes you TA.", " INFO you seem to be dodging the questions of the nature and amount of her debt, whether you are blending finances after the wedding, and how many guests YOU invited to the wedding.  All of those have a bearing on whether or not you're being an AH here.  Asking for the money for the wedding, then returning it when she gave it to you is an odd flex to be honest.  It makes it look like your point in mentioning the money was to \"put her in her place\" rather than to actually have her contribute to the wedding.", "NTA she needed a reminder not to take you for granted. The money was given for ur honeymoon so before she used it on her debt she should have okayed it with you as it was a gift to both of u. I guess we need some additional info tho like how much is the debt and how much she makes compared to you to get a bigger picture of why she thought she could just use the money .", "ESH. She should have been more thoughtful with the $1500 from her aunt given your upcoming wedding and you could have communicated your frustration better. The bigger concern for me is how you and your future bride seem to have very different ideas as to how money should be spent. Finances are one of the top reasons people split, so I wouldn\u2019t exactly be rushing to the alter until that\u2019s been ironed out.", "Yes YTA, be direct in what your issues are with her. In the long run, the money paying off debt is money you are saving since you're about to get married and have debt together. You were even paying off her debt for her at one point. If you have an issue with the budget of the wedding then say it directly rather than insinuating that your wife is selfish for having her family at the wedding while also having debt.", "Info: have you done pre marriage counseling where you have both discussed finances in depth? \n\nIf not, ESH because money fights are often the cause of divorce.", "NAH. Communication failure; she might have had the best of intentions in paying off old debts, which is often a good investment of ready cash, saving on interest and setting you guys up for a debt free future.", "Soft ESH. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything horribly wrong, nor did she. But I do think you\u2019re being a little unfair to her, and I think she\u2019s being a little inconsiderate to you.\n\nThat said, whenever your partner has a particularly emotional reaction or response to something, that\u2019s always something you want to pay attention to. There may be a deeper issue here, either around the relationship you and her have around money, or around wedding stress, or something else.", "I\u2019m confused. You sound like the two of you are basically pooling funds to pay for all expenses, including debt. If that\u2019s the case, why are you worried about what the money that comes in is earmarked for? If you have been helping her pay down the debt she brought to the relationship, does it matter if you call it debt money or wedding money? In which case, YTA here. If she were hoarding that $1500 and buying a nice handbag for herself, I could see why you\u2019d be upset, but from what you describe it sounds like she put it toward paying down debt that would likely be costing you more money to hold. Sounds like you guys have different expectations and just need to clarify spending priorities.", "I mean are you ok being the breadwinner and she\u2019s the spender? Good luck in life bro!", "NTA but once you're married your money is pooled anyway. \n\nIf you're not happy with the combined pot then that's something you should work out before getting married in my view", "So $500/month + %60 of mortgage + 100% bills + 80% shopping + 100% luxuries + 100% wedding + 100% honey moon + be ready to take a bullet*\n\nAnd she provides... what? She's just costing money. \n\nNta\n\nWhy do you get punished (paying more) because she doesnt/can't get a better job? Do you get more say in the home, wedding, and shopping? Probably not. She likely pulls the 'partnership' card when it's convenient, and pulls the 'financial abuse' card when it's convenient. \n\n*if anybody wants to push back on this point, ask yourself - if there was a break in at night and he hid in the closet, would she be with him the next day? No. 'take the bullet or I'm leaving you' is also on the table.", "YTA, not a massive one though.  You don't seem to have considered the step change you're about to go through finances wise.  All your money is about to become 'our' money, all the debt too.  Paying off a bunch of debt versus adding to the wedding costs is a completely financially neutral choice.  It makes literally no difference to your overall financial position because it all comes out in the wash of marital assets.  You need to sit down with your finance (who sounds like maybe she has a bit of a complex over this too) and have a proper conversation about how you're going to handle money going forward.  The normal thing to do is joint bank accounts etc.  Then how much you individually earn is irrelevant, you're both contributing to the household income and so all income and expenditure is 100% joint, this usually comes with discussing how to split financial chores etc.  Talking about how she only pays nearly half the mortgage instead of fully half etc comes across as though you're keeping some kind of ledger of what she owes you.", "NTA and you need to have a serious convo. This is your future, pay attention.", "NTA.  Money is a touchy subject and things can easily get emotional, especially when incomes are uneven. I suggest you schedule a time where you sit down together and work out a budget that feels fair to you both.", "NTA. You need to get on the same page financially, or your marriage isn\u2019t going to last very long.", "Nta", "YTA\n\nand petty for pointing out to her that she aKsHuLy doesn't even pay for half the mortgage.

You guys need to have a better handle on your financial issues before you get married. Why does she have so much debt? Is it now fully paid off? You sound resentful and so does she. This won\u2019t get better without working it out - make a list of all expenses and make sure the proportion of income to expenses is fair.

Do y'all have a budget together? \n\nPerhaps maybe think about premarital counseling if y'all haven't yet.

She got upset in the same way then.\nI think this all stems back to her first marriage, which I understand, but I think she's being too emotional, flying off the handle when I'm only trying to actually afford what we planned.\nI do not like her seeing upset at all, it really bothers me, but I don't think I was in the wrong here.", "Did her aunt specify that money was for the wedding?\n\nIt\u2019s the fianc\u00e9\u2019s money and she did the best thing she could with it, start clearing her debt.", "If it is possible for you to pay all the expenses for the house, my advice is that you tell her not to pay anything until the wedding. And the money she should have given for the house should go to the wedding budget. In my opinion, she sounds like she expects your money to be your money as a couple and her money to be only her money. I'm still curious how she would react if you told her that she doesn't have to pay anything for the house, but she should put the same amount towards the wedding expenses", "This. The title of the question is wrong, it should be \"AITA for asking my fiancee to spend money on our wedding instead of paying off her debt?\"\n\nIt sounds like OP and financee have some serious conversations they need to have before they get married to sort out the wider issues.", "What is this debt? Is it debt she\u2019s had for a long time or does she keep putting more things on credit? It makes a difference on who is TA. Either way this couple should sit down and have a good discussion about finances before getting married or they will be in for a very ruff time.", "How can he possibly be TA? This why this sub is so backwards he pays for everything (minus less than half the mortgage). OP even pays her debt off (500$ a month). He\u2019s paying for the wedding which she isn\u2019t making any less expensive by adding guests. She\u2019s given 1500$ and can\u2019t even bother to spare 500$ for her wedding (which her husband will give her next month anyway). The debt will still be there even after the 1500 the wedding is a one time thing. She then proceeded to overreact (maybe because she knew she was in the wrong?) making it about how OP doesn\u2019t want her family at the wedding rather than money (making OP the bad guy rather than her) so once again I\u2019ll ask how can he be TA?", "He does cut her slack by. \n\n1) paying the larger share of the mortgage\n2) giving her $500 a month\n3) paying all wedding bills\n\nAnd she seems to be driving the bills upwards in return....", "Stop infantilising women. If you think it\u2019s a reasonable request then why walk on eggshells?", "She should have discussed that with OP prior to just paying off her debts. It seems like that money was meant for the wedding.", "How? He brought up her not paying for the wedding but when she sends money he says he didn't actually want money from her.\n\nSo if the comment wasn't actually stating that he wants help paying, what was it for? Was it reasonable? \n\nIt was designed to make her feel bad, and indebted to him.", "The 1500 was given for wedding/honeymoon and she used it for her debts, while they will merge their debts after marriage it would have been nice to put some of it to the intended purpose.  If he is covering over 50% of mortgage all bills and a 500 dollar monthly stipend the least she could do is use the wedding gift for the wedding", "That was money that should have gone toward the wedding", "While I agree that she should have discussed how to spend the 1500 with OP first, I think that was the correct decision. Once they are married, **her** debt would become **their** debt, and it is usually wise to pay off debts ASAP unless if you can make more by investing the fund elsewhere.", "This!!  You would not be very smart if you combined financials with this person.  Do you even know how much debt she has.  Please DO NOT put all your money in a joint account.", "She pays under half the mortgage and nothing else\n\nHe pays all other bills and gives her $500 a month\n\nShe keeps inviting more people to a wedding he is paying for with no help\n\nThat is the crux of the matter and why he is bother She puts nothing to it - nta", "Yup, I think all couples should split proportional to income. My partner makes quite a bit less than I do so we split the mortgage 70/30 and I pay all the utilities. If she has a month with unexpected expenses then I\u2019ll cover everything 100%. \n\nI also help pay off student loans and car debts for the both of us when I get bonuses. The quicker we get out of debt the more flexibility we have with income and save on interest accumulations.", "Especially when the added 4 people bring her guests to 7 or 8.", "She earns 1/3 of what he earns so of course won't pay for as much as he does.", "My SIL's second husband looked \"great on paper\" but was hiding over 40K in debt when they got married.  He kept spending money like he had it, LOL.  New cars, bigger house, then another bigger house, time shares.  By the time they got divorced she had nothing except her retirement account and a small inheritance from her parents.", "So she has seven people coming to the wedding party. How many are you bringing?", "Do not marry this woman. She has a lot of unresolved issues she needs to work through. And obviously is drowning in debt. It\u2019s going to be a big price for you to pay, literally and figuratively.", "So $500/month + %60 of mortgage + 100% bills + 80% shopping + 100% luxuries + 100% wedding + 100% honey moon + be ready to take a bullet*\n\nAnd she provides... what? She's just costing money.", "If it is possible for you to pay all the expenses for the house, my advice is that you tell her not to pay anything until the wedding. And the money she should have given for the house should go to the wedding budget.

I'm still curious how she would react if you told her that she doesn't have to pay anything for the house, but she should put the same amount towards the wedding expenses", "This.", "Oh I agree they need to sit down and talk about finances for sure.\n\nI think i just assumed the finances were something like student loans or the like. But based on op's comment on how she's been married and divorced before though, and she paid for all that herself ... gotta wonder if maybe she's still playing off the past divorce proceedings with her ex. And if that's the case ... she really shouldn't be getting married yet.", "This!! Like how is he TA? Like what is her debt from? And he pretty much does pay for everything\u2026would he be less of an AH if he put off the wedding until she can afford more guests? It sounds like he just wants her to be considerate bc it\u2019s a lot of pressure on him to fund the entire wedding and pretty much their entire life. And they aren\u2019t even married yet!!\n\nPersonally, i would never feel comfortable going into a relationship expecting my partner to pay so much towards my debt directly or indirectly (been there before). my ex offered and it didn\u2019t feel right to accept. I cleared that myself!", "I'm glad i can represent everything that's wrong with the sub for you lol.\n\nI explained why in my post. OP says in comments it's not about the money, but proceeded to make her feel like it was. She came to him telling him about the money. I know OP said she'd already spent it on her debts, but she was asking how much they needed for the wedding and sent him money later, that he returned. Based on this, I'll assume she was willing to spend at least some of that money on the wedding. But OP turned it into a discussion on money, which neither of them actually wanted. It's miscommunication at it's core. That's why I said OP is only a minor asshole.", "I meant in this specific situation.\n\nBut also, I wouldn't consider paying the larger share of the mortgage to be \"cutting her slack.\" People should pay proportional to what they're earning. So, if he earns more, he should pay more.", "it's never enough for some people, she is using the money to pay off HER debts, not THEIRS. My ex used to be like that, I was making more money than her and she was always like 'you should pay because you make more money than I do and I need to pay my student loan'. Ballocks!!!", "he says he doesn't actually want money from her, but wants to point out that she's paying off her debts instead of giving him money? \nhe needs to ask himself why he wants to point that out. to make her feel bad? because he didn't actually want money.", "I don't see how I'm infantilizing women? Whether OP's partner was a man or a woman, I'd have the same judgement.\n\nI don't think op is an asshole for asking, I think OP is a very mild AH because he made it all about money and made her feel like she wasn't contributing even to the household. OP says it wasn't about the money, but made it all about money in the convo.", "I mean, she did, right? She went to OP, asked how much money they needed for the wedding, and then said she intended to spend in on her debt. I know OP said she'd already spent it toward her debts, but if she was asking how much they needed for the wedding ... idk. I don't think her intention was just to spend the money on debts and walk away here. It seems like she was trying to see how much money they needed for the wedding and miscommunication happened.", "Where is it stated the money was given for the wedding? It\u2019s not in the post it just says they were discussing wedding finances and she brought up her aunt sent 1500 that she put towards her debts. I don\u2019t see it being specified for the wedding unless it\u2019s a comment I missed", "I was looking for this comment.\n\nWhat kind of debt are we talking about? Is it student debt (low interest rate, long term payment plan already set up) or credit card debt (high interest rate, needs to be paid off as soon as humanly possible)?\n\nIf it's the latter, that 1500 spent now might save the both of you thousands in the future. We also don't know the circumstances of the Aunt's gift - it may have been specifically given to help your fiancee get debt free before you get married. If it was a wedding gift, it should have been spent on the wedding.\n\nOnce you get married, you both get a say in how any money is spent, so it would be good to get in that habit now.", "She invited her mum and a few others at first, now wants to add 4 more. Seven or 8 guests on her side, total isn't unreasonable. But he doesn't say how many he's inviting, leading me to believe that he has more guests and is unreasonable.", "[removed]", "They are engaged to be married, her debt is about to become his debt.", "It\u2019s not \u201cgiving him money\u201d it\u2019s helping pay for THEIR wedding. It shouldn\u2019t all be on him. $1k to debt and $500 to wedding would\u2019ve been a much better compromise.", "He wants her to help fund the wedding or stop driving the costs higher by constantly increasing the guest list", "Ok i need to ask how does one person\u2019s debt become another when they get married? \n\nIt\u2019s still in their name\u2026it just means that they would have less for their future together.  I mean, i Oyoung assume my husband would assume all of my debt upon getting married and vice versa", "Definitely and I think everyone agrees, she even sent him money which he didn\u2019t even take. So if he wanted money and she sent money, why is he returning it? If he didn\u2019t want her to contribute financially then why say it in the first place besides to make her feel inferior?", "The whole $1500 should have gone toward the wedding", "She added four people from her close family. Before it was just her mom and some friends coming. She is not constantly increasing the guest list", "Yes\u2026 because overspending at your wedding is a better decision than paying off your debt. /s\nYou do realize that debt is coming INTO the marriage, right?", "That is increasing the guest list though ;)", "BUT, she has no problem having him pay for the entire wedding while she is only concerned about HER debt", "Is it constantly increasing the guest list though? If you wanna be cheeky, go all the way."]}
