Differing financial expectations are likely to lead to a breakup", "INFO:\n\n1. What kind of debts are these?

Rather, I think that he is complaining about the fact that she received a sum of money and instead of thinking of putting part of it into something related to the couple, she thought of putting all of it into something that benefits her on her own. I think that Op would have been pleased to hear that she was willing to put 50 dollars for the wedding. In my opinion, it's not about money, it's about thought. Op said that he helped her pay off some of her debts and that he pays most of the bills but he also said that he has no problem with that. And from the post it appears that he is the only one who is struggling to make a budget for the wedding, even though he may feel that financially he does everything for the wedding (and he really does) and he would probably like to hear that she would be willing to help. Considering that he helped her pay off part of her debts, I don't think he would have used the money for the wedding. I think he was more bothered by the fact that he is struggling to make a budget for both of them and she doesn't think to help even though she has more money now", "Yeah, YTA, but minorly. She was using the money to pay off debts, not to buy herself something nice or something. And she makes a third of the money you do? Cut her a bit of slack.\n\nI do think she overreacted by assuming you don't want her family at the wedding. And weddings can be expensive and stressful times. When you can, sit down and talk to her about this.\n\nAlso if you want her to put some money toward the wedding, that's not an unreasonable request, but you need to talk about it without acting like she's not doing her part.", "Do you know the full extent of her debt?", "INFO: what kind of luxuries do you buy. Is it some clothes, because you can't walk naked? Or do you regularly buy expensive designer handbags for her.", "Question: Was the money from her auntie specifically for the wedding? \n\nI don't think your issue is her not contributing, it is her not talking to you about money decisions or telling you about money received from alternate sources.  Do you not believe all the money went to debt?", "NTA. The gift was for the wedding, aka for the both of you. She used it on herself without discussing it with you. It doesn't matter what she used the money for, the fact is that she spend money that was intended for the both of you on herself. That alone makes her TA.", "Ok so. NTA for this and her turning on the water works, not telling you about the money and taking your money to pay of her debts that it sounds like she had before you got together sounds manipulative. \n\nYou sound like you are going above and beyond here. She should have told you about the money and when are her debts goings to be paid off? \n\nYou have to be able to talk about money without someone bursting into tears. This is coming from someone who earns double what her partner does. We talk about money all the time as things change.", "NTA - you make a reasonable comment about economic issue and she starts crying and twists your words so it's about you not liking her family? Either she is extremely insecure and emotional, or she's delibiterately guilt tripping and manipulating you to shut down any conversation about te finances. Please take a long discussion regarding this before getting married.", "It\u2019s not like she used the $1500 to buy something frivolous, she used it to pay off debt; which , given you\u2019ll be merging your finances through marriage, is in the best interests of you BOTH", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like she is using you. This happened with my aunt and her now ex husband. She bank rolled him and paid off of his debts, and well, he is an ex for a reason. I would really consider whether she is someone you want to marry, she doesn\u2019t sound very realistic.", "NTA.\n\nPlease try to sit her down and show her the entire wedding budget + honeymoon: show her how much extra guest cost; Ask her how are you BOTH going to cover this extra cost; Offer her to delay the honeymoon until you are BOTH financially more stable and can contribute to it, and use part of the budget to cover extra guest. \n\nBased on how it goes, you may have to rethink the wedding.\n\nINFO: How big is her remaining debt?", "It does not sound as though the financial situation is unfair, but the two of you really, really need to have a long, careful, thoughtful conversation about how your finances work. Using her money to pay off debts may well be the best thing to do, but you are obviously feeling somewhat hard done by with regard to the wedding. Money can become a real problem within a marriage, so the two of you need to be very clear on how your mutual finances are going to work.  (Incidentally, it might be a less emotionally charged issue if both of you pay an agreed-upon proportion of your earnings into a joint account which is then used to pay the mortgage and other household bills.)\n\nAlso, you both need to get clarification on the wedding itself. How many guests can you afford, that kind of detail. Because if she is just spending the money without reference to the wedding budget, she isn't being responsible. However, if you are - or, she believes you are - restricting 'her' guests unreasonably while allowing yourself to invite more, this is something that will fester.  Perhaps she comes from a larger family than you, and is chafing at the need to exclude people?\n\nI can see that you tried to have this conversation and your fianc\u00e9e became over-emotional and wouldn't have it. But the conversation needs to happen.\n\nNAH", "NTA. The $1500 dollars her aunt sent was for the wedding. It was wrong that she used that money on her debt   It is not fair that you are having to pay for everything and she sounds self centered", "I think we need to ask what are her \u201cdebts?\u201d Is it from student loans, a car loan, what? If it\u2019s those then you\u2019re slightly the TA. If she\u2019s out shopping and racking up a CC bill and then paying it off, that\u2019s different and NTA for sure. How long have you been giving her $500 a month and again, what is the amount and source of debt?", "Nta. How far in debt is she?", "You have bigger issues, my friend, than just wondering about who's being the asshole here.\n\nYou and your fiance haven't even worked out how you're planning on doing money, and yet the wedding is already coming up?\n\nNTA for talking about money.\n\nBut, heading for a trainwreck?  Yes.  Just based on the little information you gave out, in your shoes, I would postpone.  Plus, separately, why did you start supporting this person you just met?\n\n$500 a month for 3 years is $18,000.  Plus $1,500 from the aunt.  That's nearly $20k.  What kind of debt is this person in??", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t marry someone who is so into debt and would emotionally blackmail me into getting her way.", "NTA. She's asking you about how much you have set aside for wedding and honeymoon, and has $1500 fall into her lap and doesn't think twice about spending it all on her debt. Not a single thought about putting any of it towards the wedding. You've been paying down her debt this whole time and it just sounds like she doesn't reciprocate. Then she throws the \"I pay half the mortgage\" at you even though you pay everything else, and then resorts to using tears to make you feel bad.", "So your fiance's aunt sent her $1500 that she spent and now she wants her aunt to be invited and you must cover her aunt's expenses?\n\nNTA\n\nShe must cover her aunt's expenses.\n\nAlso you need to talk about finances more because you are not on the same page.\n\nEither you share all your money or you keep them separate and you definetly should talk before the wedding.\n\nRight now you're giving her $500, paying the rest (more than half) of the mortgage, all the bills and groceries, all the other luxuries, wedding and honeymoon expenses.\n\nMeanwhile you have no idea what she really does with her money. \n\nI think you should make your budget(s) together and talk about how much debt each had when you started dating and how much is left now.\n\nIt seems like you suspect there's something that she isn't saying...\n\nAlso you should know before marriage if your money are her money and her money are only her money.", "NTA\n\nShe cried, blamed you, and then stormed off to manipulate you and turn you into the villain.\n\nShe\u2019s been incredibly selfish tbh, and I think you need to work these money issues out now, before you get married, otherwise you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.", "YTA - how each couple handles finances is up to them\u2026\n\nBut logically, if your fianc\u00e9 earns 1/4 of the household income (which is what it would be if you earn 3x her); strictly she should only be paying 1/4 of the household expenses. If she is paying more than 1/4 of the household expenses, there is a bigger strain on her than you and it would justify her keeping the $1500 she received from her aunt. Seems you are holding your financial strength over her head which makes you TA.", " INFO you seem to be dodging the questions of the nature and amount of her debt, whether you are blending finances after the wedding, and how many guests YOU invited to the wedding.  All of those have a bearing on whether or not you're being an AH here.  Asking for the money for the wedding, then returning it when she gave it to you is an odd flex to be honest.  It makes it look like your point in mentioning the money was to \"put her in her place\" rather than to actually have her contribute to the wedding.", "NTA she needed a reminder not to take you for granted. The money was given for ur honeymoon so before she used it on her debt she should have okayed it with you as it was a gift to both of u. I guess we need some additional info tho like how much is the debt and how much she makes compared to you to get a bigger picture of why she thought she could just use the money .", "ESH. She should have been more thoughtful with the $1500 from her aunt given your upcoming wedding and you could have communicated your frustration better. The bigger concern for me is how you and your future bride seem to have very different ideas as to how money should be spent. Finances are one of the top reasons people split, so I wouldn\u2019t exactly be rushing to the alter until that\u2019s been ironed out.", "Yes YTA, be direct in what your issues are with her. In the long run, the money paying off debt is money you are saving since you're about to get married and have debt together. You were even paying off her debt for her at one point. If you have an issue with the budget of the wedding then say it directly rather than insinuating that your wife is selfish for having her family at the wedding while also having debt.", "Info: have you done pre marriage counseling where you have both discussed finances in depth? \n\nIf not, ESH because money fights are often the cause of divorce.", "NAH. Communication failure; she might have had the best of intentions in paying off old debts, which is often a good investment of ready cash, saving on interest and setting you guys up for a debt free future.", "Soft ESH. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything horribly wrong, nor did she. But I do think you\u2019re being a little unfair to her, and I think she\u2019s being a little inconsiderate to you.\n\nThat said, whenever your partner has a particularly emotional reaction or response to something, that\u2019s always something you want to pay attention to. There may be a deeper issue here, either around the relationship you and her have around money, or around wedding stress, or something else.", "I\u2019m confused. You sound like the two of you are basically pooling funds to pay for all expenses, including debt. If that\u2019s the case, why are you worried about what the money that comes in is earmarked for? If you have been helping her pay down the debt she brought to the relationship, does it matter if you call it debt money or wedding money? In which case, YTA here. If she were hoarding that $1500 and buying a nice handbag for herself, I could see why you\u2019d be upset, but from what you describe it sounds like she put it toward paying down debt that would likely be costing you more money to hold. Sounds like you guys have different expectations and just need to clarify spending priorities.", "I mean are you ok being the breadwinner and she\u2019s the spender? Good luck in life bro!", "NTA but once you're married your money is pooled anyway. \n\nIf you're not happy with the combined pot then that's something you should work out before getting married in my view", "So $500/month + %60 of mortgage + 100% bills + 80% shopping + 100% luxuries + 100% wedding + 100% honey moon + be ready to take a bullet*\n\nAnd she provides... what? She's just costing money. \n\nNta\n\nWhy do you get punished (paying more) because she doesnt/can't get a better job? Do you get more say in the home, wedding, and shopping? Probably not. She likely pulls the 'partnership' card when it's convenient, and pulls the 'financial abuse' card when it's convenient. \n\n*if anybody wants to push back on this point, ask yourself - if there was a break in at night and he hid in the closet, would she be with him the next day? No. 'take the bullet or I'm leaving you' is also on the table.", "YTA, not a massive one though.  You don't seem to have considered the step change you're about to go through finances wise.  All your money is about to become 'our' money, all the debt too.  Paying off a bunch of debt versus adding to the wedding costs is a completely financially neutral choice.  It makes literally no difference to your overall financial position because it all comes out in the wash of marital assets.  You need to sit down with your finance (who sounds like maybe she has a bit of a complex over this too) and have a proper conversation about how you're going to handle money going forward.  The normal thing to do is joint bank accounts etc.  Then how much you individually earn is irrelevant, you're both contributing to the household income and so all income and expenditure is 100% joint, this usually comes with discussing how to split financial chores etc.  Talking about how she only pays nearly half the mortgage instead of fully half etc comes across as though you're keeping some kind of ledger of what she owes you.", "NTA and you need to have a serious convo. This is your future, pay attention.", "NTA.  Money is a touchy subject and things can easily get emotional, especially when incomes are uneven. I suggest you schedule a time where you sit down together and work out a budget that feels fair to you both.", "NTA. You need to get on the same page financially, or your marriage isn\u2019t going to last very long.", "Nta", "YTA\n\nand petty for pointing out to her that she aKsHuLy doesn't even pay for half the mortgage.

You guys need to have a better handle on your financial issues before you get married. Why does she have so much debt? Is it now fully paid off? You sound resentful and so does she. This won\u2019t get better without working it out - make a list of all expenses and make sure the proportion of income to expenses is fair.

Do y'all have a budget together? \n\nPerhaps maybe think about premarital counseling if y'all haven't yet.

Is it student debt, medical debt, 800 pairs of shoes in the closet debt?\n* Once you're married, are your finances going to be pooled or bills split proportionately and savings kept individually?\n\nIn my mind, there's a huge difference between someone who got screwed over financially and is trying to dig their way out vs. someone who's a shopaholic and continually incurring new debt.  I'm guessing that you plan on keeping finances separate except for paying bills and that's why it matters who's paying for the wedding and honeymoon.  One thing to keep in mind is if you marry someone who makes a lot less than you do and finances are kept separate, you're likely to end up in the position where things like vacations aren't possible unless you help out.  Your partner simply can't keep up on fun spending like that.\n\nIt sounds like the two of you need to sit down and deep dive your finances and expectations.

But separate finances = her gift is not your money, and she spent it on something that will enable her to better contribute to your shared household in the future.\n\n2) if you are planning to merge finances, it\u2019s almost always way better to put as much money as you two can afford into paying down her debt, to avoid interest on the loans. So I would get into the mindset of, she was making you richer.\n\nNAH, you both made reasonable decisions in a financial grey area. You need yo communicate better is all.", "I think you have to get real about the finances in the relationship and what they mean in terms of who brings what to the table.\n\n>she pays just under half of the mortgage\n\nSo piece of advice.  Regardless of salary, split the mortgage half and half.  If her name is on the title, she owns half and you own half, so you should split the payments evenly.  Otherwise you create a situation where she benefits from divorce by taking half when she's not paid half.   Don't create a financial incentive to get divorced.\n\n>I ... give her around $500 a month to help pay off her debts... I pay all bills,\n\nSo I don't like the paying debt part (I'll elaborate if asked), but you make more, so ultimately it makes sense you will pay for more in the relationship.  But if you are paying more, don't get suckered into splitting chores 50/50.  There's nothing wrong with splitting chores 50/50 if you both contribute financially 50/50 but you shouldn't be paying off her debt, paying more of household expenses, earning more, and still having to split chores.  At some point she needs to step up and pull her own weight.\n\n>At this point she began to get very emotional, crying and telling me I didn't want to pay for her family\n\nSo just see this for what it is.  It's straight up emotional manipulation.  The financial situation is clearly one sided and unfair and instead of addressing that, she's turning on the water works to make it seem like you are hurting her.   If you ignore it, she will switch to anger/rage.  It's called hunting for emotions and it's basically her searching for an emotional response that causes you to back off.\n\n>She ... sent me some money via bank transfer which I returned straight away.\n\nThis was a mistake.  She successfully manipulated this situation because now she can claim she tried to send money, but doesn't actually have to contribute.  You should figure out what is a fair amount for her to contribute (it will be less than you) then let her deliver on what she is responsible for.\n\nThe most concerning part of this scenario is how unfairly your contributions are relative to hers.   Take a step back and ask yourself what she brings to the relationship.", "Bet the money from her aunt was for the wedding and includes more of her family.  She wanted it to pay down debt.

I'm sure this young couple will eventually want to purchase a home together.\n\nThe way I see it is if $1500 is so desperately needed for the wedding it may be time to downsize the wedding. Paying off debt is far more important. Being able to financially afford a spacious home will do far more for the longevity for their relationship than splurging on a fancy wedding.\n\nI can understand op being upset if she blew that $1500 on clothes/bags or otherwise frivolous purchases.

If the monthly payments are not too high it won\u2019t stop them from buying a house, we have no idea what the debt is or what the interest rate is. If it\u2019s a credit card she needs to pay off asap, if it\u2019s student loans with a low interest rate and low monthly payments it won\u2019t really affect them being able to buy a house. (Mortgages are decided based on how much income you bring in vs how much your debt expenses are, if he\u2019s making good money and she\u2019s making decent money, it shouldn\u2019t prevent them from buying a house unless her monthly payments are a significant portion of their joint income.)\n\n\nIt\u2019s smart that she spent the money on debt, but in my opinion it should have been a joint decision where this money went. Even if he wasn\u2019t paying a higher portion of their lives I\u2019d say they should both decide, but the fact that he\u2019s paying for most of their joint expenses means she definitely should have talked to him about her windfall.", "A few things have been accumulating here over time:\n\n1.

This coupe is likely no exception. He's probably just giving her a more expensive wedding than she can afford because she wants it.\n\nShe's the one who needs to clean up her spendthrift life and make more money, not bring debts into a marriage and then break a generous man's balls for questioning a one-time money flow.\n\nStop justifying away the fact that the man is somehow making a poor call here.
