This a recurring argument. This is something I've been working as I'm not naturally an affectionate person and agreed that I do need to be better about it. \n\nIt somehow devolved into an argument about a concert we went to the night before. The food at the concert was really expensive. One pizza slice was $9 so I was like let's just each get one since it's so expensive (especially since I knew I needed to pay, he's saving up for a medical procedure and I make more money than him). Well, during the argument he said that it pissed him off that I didn't \"allow\" him to get more than one slice. And also that he \"hates being out in public with me\" because I don't show enough affection like other couples he sees at concerts. \n\nThat upset me, because I just paid cash for a new car like a week ago (because my previous car got totaled) and I'm trying to be more conscious of my spending. It bothered me that he expected me to pay for an additional slice. Like yes, of course, $9 extra isn't a lot but it adds up. And I also paid for the concert tickets, beer, and snow cones so it was a $$ night. \n\nI then felt compelled to mention how much I do spend on him, maybe it wasn't the right time or place, I get that now, but emotions were heightened. I brought up that I've never once asked about the $250 he owes me from several months ago. This is when the convo took a turn. I was like, \"it makes me feel like my money isn't important to you.\" Especially since he had been ordering things on Amazon that were sort of expensive instead of prioritizing paying me back. He said that he gets depression and needs to buy himself things here and there to feel better. \n\nHe then was like \"well I guess I'll have to cancel my medical procedure because you just have to have your $250 back.\" I had never asked for it back, I simply brought it up because I felt offended that he expected me to pay for his pizza and got mad when I didn't. He was like \"I thought I could trust you, I thought you were a nice person, guess I was wrong. There's no coming back from this.\" And then he left my apartment.\n\nAm I the asshole for not spending the extra $9 on another slice of pizza and then bringing up the money he owes me?", "created_utc": 1692041917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r4p18/aita_for_bringing_up_the_money_my_boyfriend_29m/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's not how a healthy relationship works. He is not a nice person, wrapped in a big red flag.", "Is the procedure getting his head removed from his ass?", "NTA.\n\nI think the BF is taking advantage of you and is playing the victim card. He is not genuine in his approach, acting entitled / opportunist /  parasite demanding you to buy him stuff ( tickets, pizza etc )\n\nIf he is depressed, buying stuff off Amazon  is not treatment. He could take counselling. You can decide to support or stay with him, however, in my opinion he has lots of red flags and  think may be its time to move on.\n\nEDIT: He is a parasite. You need active treatment to remove him.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you prevented him from buying himself more pizza, just that you weren't footing the bill for it. \n\nHe's right that there's no coming back from this. He showed his whole ass and it's going to be hard to forget it. Weaponizing his mental and physical health to guilt you into giving him your money is gross and manipulative. Don't believe his drama for one second, he's only trying to make you back off so he doesn't have to acknowledge that he's at fault (and maybe even push you to the point where you snap and say that he doesn't have to pay you back at all). \n\nThis isn't about the $9 slice of pizza. It's that you said no. That you made it clear that he didn't have free access to your money. He wants to shame you and scare you so you don't do it again.", "NTA. What a baby. He's trying to make you feel bad because of his own inadequacies. In his mind it's him vs you and as long as he gets what he wants, it's okay if you have to foot the bill. Money matters and is something you need to be on the same page with in a relationship so you both don't feel resentful. If he wanted that extra slice, he could just buy it like an adult ($9 for a slice of pizza BTW? F that). He also can't just bring up things in an argument and then get upset when you rebuttal and call him out for his bs. You never said he had to cancel his medical situation, you just brought up the truth of how you aren't stingy because of all the things you do pay for for him, and hiw he's actually the stingy one. Honestly, if I were you, I'd let him leave and lock the door behind him", "NTA, he is your boyfriend not your husband, so quit spending money on him.
