You should donate it to a children's charity or something to benefit a kid that will be respectful and appreciate it. I'd gladly accept a PS5 if I was offered one!", "ETA - while your brother sounds spoiled, it is in bad taste to give a used gift without clarifying first that they would want it. You could have asked your brown if he wanted your old system for his birthday. If yes - great, if not - sell your old system and give him some cash or another gift.", "ESH (gently)\n\nYou made it look like a brand new console which could be seen as a dickish move and sort of tacky. I mean, you bought it in front of him. Of course he would think it was his.\n\nThat being said\u2026. He was rude. But It\u2019s also really rude to take back a gift. 14 year old boys are weird. He acted like a spoiled brat but I personally wouldn\u2019t have immediately taken it back. I would\u2019ve communicated with him, because you\u2019re an adult. He isn\u2019t. It seems a little childish on your part to immediately just revoke the gift without talking to him.", "YTA for putting it in the original box, making him think it was brand new. It feels like something was taken for him, something he thought he had for a moment. Also, a gift is a gift. Once you give it, it's not yours anymore (and I mean that legally).", "NTA 100%, PS5s are expensive as hell, any gift is better than nothing, and if he wants to be a spoiled little shit about a gift 99% of kids would be ecstatic for, then he can be a spoiled little giftless shit", "Nta - he seems to be a choosing beggar", "everyone saying YTA has never had to budget anything ever. the most expensive gift for either birthdays or holidays I was given in my life was a whiteboard. I'm using it to remember stuff. if I ever got something as expensive as a ps5 from my parents I'd pay them over half of what they originally paid for it because it's too expensive for a birthday gift. him being entitled like that for something used? nah. that's brat behaviour. he should be grateful he got a ps5 in the first place. NTA. HARD.", "YTA. Nothing says \u2018I love you little brother\u2019 like \u2018here\u2019s your birthday present, my second hand used PS5 because I got myself a better one and don\u2019t want this one anymore. Hey, I could sell it but *I want you to have it.*\u2019 Yes, little bro was an Ah at his birthday party and afterward but I\u2019m cutting him a ton of slack because that was such an insulting way to give it to him.", "NTA and he wouldn't have got $100 if he was my brother.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t like his gift, so you got him another one. $100 is a generous gift. If the ps5 was better, well that\u2019s not what he said when he complained.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a little spoiled brat, do not buy shit for him. If my older sibling bought me a second-hand ps5 i'd be jumping in joy.", "NTA.", "Ooo, this is a tough one.\n\nBut I'm going to say YTA for giving him a second-hand gift in the first place. \n\nFor a non-birthday gift, it would have been exceedingly generous to give him your old PS5. \n\nBut for a birthday? Sorry, but I see his point. You're just giving him a discarded item after you got yourself an upgrade. That's not really a \"gift\" in my book, even if you would have sold it otherwise. \n\nHe's 14. Why not give him a choice? \"What do you want for your birthday? Would you like my old PS5? Or I could give you $100, or is there something else you had in mind?\"", "Ummmm\u2026 Yeah.\n\nProbably unpopular opinion: it is tacky to give a used item in such fashion, in my opinion. \n\nI am of the mind that you should\u2019ve given your brother the $100 (in a birthday card) as his birthday gift. Then, later on in time, you should\u2019ve asked him if he wanted your old PS5.\n\nSo, with that said: YTA.", "NTA and he\u2019s a spoiled little brat.", "He should be happy he was even getting a PS5. They are so hard to find still. NTA", "NTA, He's being pretty selfish tbh, $400 gift from a sibling is very generous. Also there is nothing wrong with second hand stuff, especially since he knew where it came from.", "NTA. He\u2019s 14 not 4. I wouldn\u2019t have even left the $100. I would have just left with it.", "NTA you aren't his mom, he shouldn't expect a $500 gift from you on his birthday. And if he wanted to keep it, he shouldn't have insulted it or you. You still gave him $100, which a 14 year old should be very happy with. He can choose his own present.\n\nYou spent your own money and are very justified in your actions IMO.\n\nHonestly if he is going to be entitled, I'd give him nothing at all. Insulting anyone who gifts something to you is incredibly rude. \n\nYour brother is acting entitled and needs to learn respect. \"You catch more flies with honey.\" \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\" He is getting too old to excuse bad manners.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him an extremely nice gift for his birthday. I'm assuming he's a gamer? Anyway, it's more than generous. You didn't even have to give him your old one in the first place. For him to feel entitled to the 'new' one shows he's a bit spoiled. I wish my sibling would have given me a second-hand ps4 growing up", "I'm sorry but your brother is so ungrateful. You were so generous to even leave him tge 100 dollars. Until he learns to be appreciative and apologises to you, I wouldn't give him a dime or any gifts.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did a very, very nice thing for your little brother here and he completely rejected it on the grounds that it wasn't brand new. My parents bought pretty much all our game consoles second-hand when we were kids except MAYBE the Wii and the first DS lite/2DS we shared between us. (Ofc this was back when finding a used console was pretty simple and not Mission Impossible, but even so) We were always ecstatic to have them. My 60+ year old father still won't buy himself a new console (even though he could, but he feels it's too big an expense for \"just him\" bc he cares about the family so much) and would probably be over the moon if I or another family did something like this for him (I wish I could, tbh, but I'm broke atm) so yeah, your brother needs to grow up and realize that expensive presents are expensive presents regardless of being used or not.\n\nMy guess is he thought you bought the new console for him somehow because he knows you already have one, but like you mention, you didn't buy it with an indicator it was for him. Next time just sell your used console and give him a gift card - he can save them if he wants a new PS5. \n\nAlso, it's striking me that you gave him $100 which is also way more cash than I'd have been trusted with at 14. So triple that NTA. He's spoiled and you're teaching him actions have consequences.", "NTA your brother is being a selfish child and 100 bucks is more than enough for him to buy himself something nice. Bail while you have time. More so if your parents are pushing you to play nice after you have them 100 bucks. Keep both, sell the system you don't want.", "NTA although you probably shouldn't have put it in the new system's box. He's a little entitled, and you still gave him $100", "No being ungrateful isn\u2019t cute.", "He's extremely ungrateful but you should've just given the card with money for his birthday and offered the console at another time. Regifting is tricky. So both of you are kinda the AH", "NTA, not a thief, not going to drive home the lesson though when you give him a $100 consolation prize.", "Yeah I read all the other comments and I'm with soft ESH. Teenage boys can be entitled idiots that have no concept of value, he misunderstood the situation and acted badly. But you are an adult and really could have predicted given the scenario, you could have let him know as he opened it not to expect a new console.", "NTA. He's an asshole for despising second hand gifts. And the theft thing is nuts! You gave him a hundred dollars for his birthday.", "he can sell them for around $450 to $600 on ebay. so he's the AH.", "I\u2019m a bit confused, yes he\u2019s acting entitled but it sounds like he was giving the impression that the PS5 you saw together was going to be his", "NTA. He's old enough to not behave like that", "NTA Why the hell would you give him $100", "NTA- You gave him $100 and I don't even think he deserved that.", "NTA for giving the used console. It is worth $300-400, and I\u2019m guessing in good condition. You could have sold it to recover the cost of your new one. And he can sell it for the same amount. \n\nI don\u2019t know how your family normally does things, but that\u2019s a generous gift for a 14 year old sibling where I come from.", "To be clear he literally said that I was an asshole for not giving him the better system and that if I didn't he didn't even want the used one.", "This.

I\u2019ve gifted many uses gifts before. I\u2019ve gotten used gifts before. I never once thought...how crappy of this person to give me a used gift. I thought...wow this is awesome. I know they couldn\u2019t afford this new and yet they wanted me to have this so they worked hard and found one in great condition that will serve it\u2019s purpose. You have to be some kind of spoiled to think a ps5 (even used) is a crappy gift.", "Yes because giving a 14 yr old kid a 'discarded' ps5 is a bad idea. Do you know how hard it is to still buy one? This is a very generous sister. She could have sold it for over 500 used. If I were 14, I'd be ecstatic. Kid needs to learn about entitlement", "Bro what? \ud83d\ude02  how is it tacky? That game came out less then two years ago ppl are still paying 800+ for news ones or retail price for used ones so. Yu expect them to get a brand new game?", "I wouldn't say that. If, as a 14 years old kid, I'd have gotten a second hand console, no matter which one it is, I'd be thrilled.\n\nThe kid's an entitled brat. Op's NTA", "He could sell it for $$$. I could sell it for $350 if I felt like it. I thought it was a pretty cool gift.", "You clearly did not grow in a struggling household based on your reply LOL.", "There\u2019s a whole huge market for used electronics dude! Especially those that have original packaging.", "Tacky? Maybe I just grew up broke but I remember being gifted my older cousins PS1 after the PS2 had been released and it was one of the coolest things I remember being given as a kid.", "What planet are you from? Jesus Christ what a bad take.", "Used items are not tacky. \n\nI've encouraged relatives I know don't have alot of money to buy doll beds or other toys that would be expensive in a toy store etc used for my toddler. Heck even smaller toys.\nOr nicer clothes brands for the teens in fashion second hand shops, you can find fashion clothes for 50-80% under price. And you know what? The kids have been thrilled with every single gift. \nThen I as the parent take care of the rest. \nAnd the relatives has been so happy to gift the kids something they know they will love but without blowing their budget to feel \"oh I really want to gift this thing\" \nI gave my brother a second hand console I had becouse i had upgraded. And he was happy. Now we could play stuff together. \n\nSo no. Its not exactly tacky.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to read as many comments as I did to finally see this. I agree completely", "She put it in the original packaging not the new one\u2019s", "It\u2019s not in the \u201cnew system\u2019s box\u201d.

He probably would have been happy with a second-hand gift if he didn't, for that first second, think he was getting this new and better system. I'm sure it's not about not liking a secondhand gift, but about getting his hopes dashed and feeling foolish about it and all of the Myriad of things 14 year old boys are feeling", "Once you give a gift, it's now property of the other person. If I give you a bracelet, then take it back and you give the money I paid for the bracelet, that doesn't mean I'm in the right. So yes, brother was ungrateful but you should not just take back something you gave as a present. Legally I think it is theft. 'The donee becomes legal owner of the property from the time the gift is made.'", "He saw me buy it. But I never in any way indicated that it was for him. $500 is a little bit out of my budget to give as a gift.", "Because he saw her buy it a week before his birthday, and then opened up a gift with what looked like a new box. I think it's less about him expecting such a fancy gift, and more about him opening it and thinking for a second it was such a fancy gift and then having his 14 year old heart broken", "It was his birthday. It was my budget for his birthday if I hadn't given him my old console.", "He was with you when you bought a brand new system and so it is totally reasonable that when he saw the box that's what he thought it was. Yes he overreacted and was a jerk to you, but he's 14 and everything is emotionally fraught. You're 28. You can do better. Rather than getting into a pissing match with a child, because he still is a child, and going through a lot of upheaval and his emotional life, as all adolescents do, you can have a reasonable conversation with him. Start by empathizing with him and understanding why he was upset, and explain to him that why you didn't mean to trick him into thinking he was getting a brand new PS5 with a drive, you can see how that must have felt for him. Then say that you love him and you tend to spend x amount of money on him, and that you figured a second hand PS5 seemed more valuable than what you would tend to spend on him for his birthday, but if he's at the stage where he'd rather have cash, that's fine and you offer him $100. You can tell him you don't like how he talked to you and how he treated you, and that you're not going to communicate with him when he's acting like that, but when he's able to have a calm and caring conversation with you you're always be there for him. And mean it. Again, he's a child. You are not", "I think he's saying you should have sold yours and then spent the $350 on a different secondhand PS5 that didn't have his profile already on it, because that would have been a better birthday present, or something.", "Or you can just ease up and give it back to him", ">even if you would have sold it otherwise.\n\nI covered that in my post.", "Getting *yourself* a shiny new toy, and giving someone else the old one?

Is that better?", "That's a him problem. He's entitled", "He said that if I didn't give him my new one he didn't want my used system. I was following his spoken wishes.", "The brother said he didn't want it, so...", "Yeah, not your fault. When I was around 12/13 my SIL (who is more like my big sister, 10+ years older than me) bought herself a really fancy expensive hair straightener when we were shopping together. I remember commenting how nice it was and how much I wanted one too, since I didn't have one yet and I was just getting into my teenage years. That was a few days before my birthday and she gifted me her old hair straightener, which was only about 2 years old and was also very expensive back then (it still works today, 10+ years later and it's really nice). I was so so grateful and happy. My point is even as a kid/moody almost teenager I wasn't expecting expensive gifts just because I saw someone buy it when I was with them. My big brother also constantly gifted me his old PC equipment when he got new stuff and I am eternally grateful. Your brother is acting very entitled and spoiled. Hand-me-downs from older siblings used to be a privilege, especially stuff like PCs and consoles.\n\nNTA.", "Fair enough, but he obviously miss read the situation and he is only a kid! Although an entitled kid", "I have to agree! Sure, he miss read the situation but I can understand why. \n\nAlso if it was me giving a second hand gift (even if it\u2019s expensive) I probably would have let the recipient know ahead of time.", "It's his money so he can buy himself what he wants.

It won't ever be theft. Your brother refused the gift. He said he didn't want it.", "Letting the recipient know ahead of time is such a good idea. I have given second hand gifts before and explained it while they're opening it, and in one case I realize the person was a bit confused and seemed upset until they wrapped their head around it. They became gracious pretty quickly because they've learned the emotional regulation that is a lot harder for 14 year olds to know, but I realize that I should have exactly said that I got them this because it was something they'd always wanted, and I have it and don't use it, and you can't find it new anymore, but if they prefer I would give them x amount of money instead to choose a different gift", "Ooh another assumption.", "Definitely agree, my partner bought me Pok\u00e9mon snap second hand for my birthday at my request and I was more than happy with that!
