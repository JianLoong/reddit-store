I'd gladly accept a PS5 if I was offered one!", "ETA - while your brother sounds spoiled, it is in bad taste to give a used gift without clarifying first that they would want it.

He acted like a spoiled brat but I personally wouldn\u2019t have immediately taken it back. I would\u2019ve communicated with him, because you\u2019re an adult. He isn\u2019t.

I'm using it to remember stuff. if I ever got something as expensive as a ps5 from my parents I'd pay them over half of what they originally paid for it because it's too expensive for a birthday gift. him being entitled like that for something used? nah. that's brat behaviour. he should be grateful he got a ps5 in the first place.

Sorry, but I see his point. You're just giving him a discarded item after you got yourself an upgrade. That's not really a \"gift\" in my book, even if you would have sold it otherwise. \n\nHe's 14. Why not give him a choice? \"What do you want for your birthday? Would you like my old PS5? Or I could give you $100, or is there something else you had in mind?\"", "Ummmm\u2026 Yeah.\n\nProbably unpopular opinion: it is tacky to give a used item in such fashion, in my opinion. \n\nI am of the mind that you should\u2019ve given your brother the $100 (in a birthday card) as his birthday gift. Then, later on in time, you should\u2019ve asked him if he wanted your old PS5.\n\nSo, with that said: YTA.", "NTA and he\u2019s a spoiled little brat.", "He should be happy he was even getting a PS5. They are so hard to find still. NTA", "NTA, He's being pretty selfish tbh, $400 gift from a sibling is very generous. Also there is nothing wrong with second hand stuff, especially since he knew where it came from.", "NTA. He\u2019s 14 not 4. I wouldn\u2019t have even left the $100. I would have just left with it.", "NTA you aren't his mom, he shouldn't expect a $500 gift from you on his birthday. And if he wanted to keep it, he shouldn't have insulted it or you. You still gave him $100, which a 14 year old should be very happy with. He can choose his own present.\n\nYou spent your own money and are very justified in your actions IMO.\n\nHonestly if he is going to be entitled, I'd give him nothing at all. Insulting anyone who gifts something to you is incredibly rude. \n\nYour brother is acting entitled and needs to learn respect. \"You catch more flies with honey.\" \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\" He is getting too old to excuse bad manners.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him an extremely nice gift for his birthday. I'm assuming he's a gamer? Anyway, it's more than generous. You didn't even have to give him your old one in the first place. For him to feel entitled to the 'new' one shows he's a bit spoiled. I wish my sibling would have given me a second-hand ps4 growing up", "I'm sorry but your brother is so ungrateful. You were so generous to even leave him tge 100 dollars. Until he learns to be appreciative and apologises to you, I wouldn't give him a dime or any gifts.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did a very, very nice thing for your little brother here and he completely rejected it on the grounds that it wasn't brand new. My parents bought pretty much all our game consoles second-hand when we were kids except MAYBE the Wii and the first DS lite/2DS we shared between us. (Ofc this was back when finding a used console was pretty simple and not Mission Impossible, but even so) We were always ecstatic to have them. My 60+ year old father still won't buy himself a new console (even though he could, but he feels it's too big an expense for \"just him\" bc he cares about the family so much) and would probably be over the moon if I or another family did something like this for him (I wish I could, tbh, but I'm broke atm) so yeah, your brother needs to grow up and realize that expensive presents are expensive presents regardless of being used or not.\n\nMy guess is he thought you bought the new console for him somehow because he knows you already have one, but like you mention, you didn't buy it with an indicator it was for him. Next time just sell your used console and give him a gift card - he can save them if he wants a new PS5. \n\nAlso, it's striking me that you gave him $100 which is also way more cash than I'd have been trusted with at 14. So triple that NTA. He's spoiled and you're teaching him actions have consequences.", "NTA your brother is being a selfish child and 100 bucks is more than enough for him to buy himself something nice. Bail while you have time. More so if your parents are pushing you to play nice after you have them 100 bucks. Keep both, sell the system you don't want.", "NTA although you probably shouldn't have put it in the new system's box. He's a little entitled, and you still gave him $100", "No being ungrateful isn\u2019t cute.", "He's extremely ungrateful but you should've just given the card with money for his birthday and offered the console at another time. Regifting is tricky. So both of you are kinda the AH", "NTA, not a thief, not going to drive home the lesson though when you give him a $100 consolation prize.", "Yeah I read all the other comments and I'm with soft ESH. Teenage boys can be entitled idiots that have no concept of value, he misunderstood the situation and acted badly. But you are an adult and really could have predicted given the scenario, you could have let him know as he opened it not to expect a new console.", "NTA. He's an asshole for despising second hand gifts. And the theft thing is nuts! You gave him a hundred dollars for his birthday.", "he can sell them for around $450 to $600 on ebay. so he's the AH.", "I\u2019m a bit confused, yes he\u2019s acting entitled but it sounds like he was giving the impression that the PS5 you saw together was going to be his", "NTA. He's old enough to not behave like that", "NTA Why the hell would you give him $100", "NTA- You gave him $100 and I don't even think he deserved that.", "NTA for giving the used console. It is worth $300-400, and I\u2019m guessing in good condition. You could have sold it to recover the cost of your new one.

I know they couldn\u2019t afford this new and yet they wanted me to have this so they worked hard and found one in great condition that will serve it\u2019s purpose.

If I give you a bracelet, then take it back and you give the money I paid for the bracelet, that doesn't mean I'm in the right.

It was my budget for his birthday if I hadn't given him my old console.", "He was with you when you bought a brand new system and so it is totally reasonable that when he saw the box that's what he thought it was. Yes he overreacted and was a jerk to you, but he's 14 and everything is emotionally fraught. You're 28. You can do better. Rather than getting into a pissing match with a child, because he still is a child, and going through a lot of upheaval and his emotional life, as all adolescents do, you can have a reasonable conversation with him. Start by empathizing with him and understanding why he was upset, and explain to him that why you didn't mean to trick him into thinking he was getting a brand new PS5 with a drive, you can see how that must have felt for him. Then say that you love him and you tend to spend x amount of money on him, and that you figured a second hand PS5 seemed more valuable than what you would tend to spend on him for his birthday, but if he's at the stage where he'd rather have cash, that's fine and you offer him $100. You can tell him you don't like how he talked to you and how he treated you, and that you're not going to communicate with him when he's acting like that, but when he's able to have a calm and caring conversation with you you're always be there for him. And mean it. Again, he's a child. You are not", "I think he's saying you should have sold yours and then spent the $350 on a different secondhand PS5 that didn't have his profile already on it, because that would have been a better birthday present, or something.", "Or you can just ease up and give it back to him", ">even if you would have sold it otherwise.\n\nI covered that in my post.", "Getting *yourself* a shiny new toy, and giving someone else the old one?

I remember commenting how nice it was and how much I wanted one too, since I didn't have one yet and I was just getting into my teenage years. That was a few days before my birthday and she gifted me her old hair straightener, which was only about 2 years old and was also very expensive back then (it still works today, 10+ years later and it's really nice). I was so so grateful and happy. My point is even as a kid/moody almost teenager I wasn't expecting expensive gifts just because I saw someone buy it when I was with them. My big brother also constantly gifted me his old PC equipment when he got new stuff and I am eternally grateful. Your brother is acting very entitled and spoiled.

I have given second hand gifts before and explained it while they're opening it, and in one case I realize the person was a bit confused and seemed upset until they wrapped their head around it.

You were very generous and he was not gracious.

By junk she meant phone and she is 12 and she\u2019d said this about a second hand iphone I had bought for her.

If you bought a used console from the store and gave it to him, that feels different to some degree than just being given your second hand console, because it would have been new to him. Not saying you should have done that, but just as an example, because it's all about the feels.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I probably would have offered him the PlayStation as soon as you bought the new one.
