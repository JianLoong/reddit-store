You might be more disciplined than I am, but if I make changes to a routine that works for me (like do something immediately after I get home), sometimes that results in my bagging the activity at all as that break will ruin my motivation.  Also, 20 minutes today could be 30 tomorrow and 45 next week.  She can hit pause and watch the rest after the gym.  She goes on your time schedule or she goes alone (or not at all, not your responsibility).", "NTA. She wants a gym buddy\u2014someone to motivate her and get her to go exercise. My neighbor and I are gym buddies and work with each other\u2019s schedules and accommodate each other\u2019s needs in the moment (e.g., we were supposed to go to the gym on Thursday but I had a lot of work so I asked if she\u2019d be interested in an at-home yoga workout instead, and she agreed). You aren\u2019t a gym buddy. You have your routine and it works for you and you don\u2019t need the extra person to motivate you. She does.

You told her when to be ready. She wasn't ready.", "NTA - You have a routine. You've told her this routine. I could see if you had to wait 20 minutes for her to get off work.  That would be different. She just didn't want to go because of a TV show. She could have completed the show when she got home.", "NTA. This isn't an instance where the two of you decided to start working out, and go to the gym together every day. This is an instance of someone interested in joining you in your established routine.

When did giving someone a ride, which is doing them a favor, start becoming something where the person being given the ride dictates when people get to leave and how long they have to stay?

If she wants you to adjust your schedule for her. Thats ridiculous. \n\nFair is relevent. Fair is she gets a free ride  as she  long as she is willing to go when u do.", "NTA if she wants to go at a different time she should get an uber.", "NTA.

She needs to be ready and on time.", "Nta, the problem with your friend is that she doesn't have the same motivation as you do. This is the type of response you expect from her and unless shes serious about working out its likely she wont come with you on short notice. My advice is tell her if she wants to come with you then she need to contact you to go. She knows you go everyday after work so its not a surprise when you go. Sure giving someone a helping hand is great but it's on them to muster up the will to go.", "NTA. Your acquaintance can find her own way to the gym.", "NTA. She is making you an AH in her head so that it's anything but her own fault that she isn't working out.\n\nI have had people wanting to join my informal \"study groups\" who did the same thing, making it everyone else's fault that they couldn't make themselves do what they should be doing. Also, in the time of streaming everything, she couldn't pause her show? Or find it for DL for later?", "NTA. This is r/ChoosingBeggars material. She's basically asking you for a ride to the gym, but wants *you* to 'work around' her TV show-watching time. She can find another way to work out...if she actually wants to, which her actions say she doesn't.", "If you\u2019re making it fair for both of you, she\u2019ll be sharing the driving? NTA.

Also I\u2019m willing to be flexible if someone else has something urgent comes up or has to work late \u2014 stuff like that. She\u2019s the tag along and her the reason she wanted you to throw off your schedule was for a show. Driver ultimately calls the shot in this situation and the non-driver has to take it or leave it. \n\nAlso about her comment about making it fair for both of you \u2014 what is *she* contributing to make things \u201cfair\u201d?", "NTA. you already said that it's not an activity based hangout. You're just at the gym at the same time doing your separate workouts... sounds like what she wants is a gym buddy. You're not an asshole because she expected something that you already told her you weren't going to deliver.", "Nta. If she had a good reason, like a last minute work issue, then it would be nah, but no one should put things off for tv", "NTA 'work around each other, 'to make it fair for both of us'. what she means is you should work around her to make her life easier.", "Nta", "NTA.  She is asking to join you in your established routine.  She needs to be ready for your scheduled workout time.  She can record the TV show.", "NTA \nWhy should you make it fair ? Is she paying you ? If not , you are doing her a favour. She should respect that", "NTA. The one asking the favor (in this case, transport) fits in with the one offering.", "NTA. I've found that exercise is easier to stick with if it has a strict schedule", "NTA - just because it\u2019s not a scheduled class doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t follow a schedule.  You gave her the option, come with me at this time or don\u2019t go or find your own way.  If she can\u2019t respect your time, then she needs to find a solution on her time.", "NTA.

She can either go with you around that or not go at all.", "Ultimately it was only 20 minutes for you to wait, so being unwilling to accommodate your friend makes YTA.  That said I would have made it clear this was the only time I'd be waiting, as I want to keep my routine.  As for not talking at the gym it's kinda sucks, since that's the best part of going to the gym with a friend, but if you made it clear that you only want to focus on the workout, then NTA on that front.", "Agree\n\nNTA", "Im pretty sure it means exactly what it says.\n\nI think this woman believes that since OP offered her a lift, OP now has to make all sorts of accommodations to give that lift.\n\nInstead of, y'kno, just be thankful that she is getting a lift at all.", "What television show can't be paused? This isn't the 50's, she wasn't going to miss anything and it's pretty shitty friend behavior to inconvenience someone because you don't want to hit the pause button.", "Thanks for your views. Nicer in what way?", "Yes I said exactly what I wrote", "I mean she wants to use the treadmill and I'm over by the weight machines, so it would be impossible to have a conversation anyway...", "This woman probably could have put the show on her phone and continued watching in the car.", "Then yeah YTA for the way you said it.", "Okay", "OP, you are not :)"]}
