You're already offering the ride. \n\nNTA.", "NTA  it is not a 'fair' arrangement in the first place .\nYou are doing her a favour by offering her a lift. She can sort her own gym attendance out for whenever she wants.", "NTA.\n\nIf she'd ask you to wait because she needs to wait for the babysitter to arrive (or anything else not flexible) than her request would have been understandable but because of a TV show? No way.\n\nPlus if you're the one driving always (as she doesn't) than no, she has to keep to your schedule or not go as you're paying for car, fuel, insurance etc. to have exactly the freedom to go where you want to go when you want to go.", "I don't drive, and I completely agree. The ride is a favor, one to be repaid when possible with gas or coffee (neither ass nor grass appeal to my friends). \n\nAlso the friend should look into a bicycle. Gets your cardio in and you're at your destination 3x as fast.", "She's already said if I don't take her she won't be going. So she won't 'go whenever she wants'", "Not even then, if she's stuck at work she can make her own way to the gym, smash a quicker workout, and catch a ride home at the same time as OP normally leaves. The friend's goal should be to inconvenience OP as little as possible to ensure continued offers of transportation, not find acceptable excuses to peddle.", "lol right?  \nHey can you hold off on your good, healthy habits so I can have 20 more minutes of laziness?  \nCool thanks.", "[removed]", "I really hate that some people\u2019s idea of \u201cfriendship\u201d only translates to others accommodating for/helping them. OP, 20 minutes is a long ass time. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re offering her a lift because you want/need a partner, you\u2019re just being nice. NTA!", "I get that, but she need to understand she is responsible to her choices, not you.", "What you said might make her think you doing this to prevent her from going, which isn't true - she is preventing herself from going", "Bot. Stolen comment.", "And I get that 20 minutes may not seem like that much time, but if you're completely ready and waiting around for someone, 20 minutes seems like an eternity! Plus that tags 20 minutes on to the end of the gym which means getting home closer to 7, eating later, possibly going to bed a little later so you're not trying to sleep on a completely full stomach. My one little suggestion would have been to message the friend around 5 to remind them they had 15 minutes to get ready; at least for the first few times until they get into a routine as well. You shouldn't have to do that (set an alarm, duh!), but it might be a helpful reminder for them that you're on a schedule.", "No, she said 'if you don't take me then I can't go'. So I can then said 'you go when I go or you don't go at all'", "My Tivo will only pause live TV for 20 minutes.  Major PITA if I happen to be watching something that isn't recorded.", "Yeah, I think it's putting the emphasis on the wrong thing. \n\"You can go on your own or come with me\". \nShe can go herself (taxi, bus, someone else). She just choose not to.", "NTA What a joke! We should work around each other? What does she even bring to the table when she is just glomming on for a free ride?", "For her to watch TV?   That's probably why she needs to go to the gym.  No, you're not an AH.  You're the boss.", "Nta, when someone gives you a ride, it's on their schedule not yours. She chose to watch TV rather than go out. That's her decision, not yours.", "Lolololol NTA. What's fair for both of you is her being ready when you're heading the gym. She's the one getting the free ride.", "LOL - By \"work around each other\" she means you should make concessions for her schedule, while she does exactly what she wants, when she wants.  NTA", "NTA. She invited herself to your workout and then wanted to change your schedule. No.", "20 minutes becomes an hour 2 hours, until she claims you\u2019re to much.", "NTA\nYou are doing her the favour, not the other way around. You shouldn't have to schedule your gym visits around her TV schedule.", "NTA. Your friend doesn\u2019t drive and you were kind enough to offer driving her when you go. She knew this going into it. You\u2019re not her mom, you\u2019re not required to work with her schedule to get her places. Lmao your friend clearly isn\u2019t mature enough to understand that.", "You\u2019re giving them a ride, it\u2019s already a favor in itself. NTA", "NTA, I missed the part that was \u201cfair\u201d to you? \ud83e\udd14", "NTA Tell her there are magic buttons like the one saying \"pause\" or the one saying \"record\"", "NTA - People who refuse to respect your time are not your friends.  If this is how it's going to be with her, it's just going to be an irritating hassle for you to go together.", "Nope, not at all.  Your offer was to come with you, not change your schedule to acommodate her\u2026.", "NTA if she wants to tag along she can dvr what ever she is watching or watch it on demand later you also warned her that you won\u2019t change your routine", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask for a gym partner and actually made is abundantly clear you wouldn\u2019t be working out with her. You offered a ride, available at a specific time, take it or leave it.\n\nIt is SO much harder to stick to a gym routine if you have to work around someone else.", "She invited herself and then tried to change the routine. No NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have a schedule. She asked for a ride. If she wants that ride, she\u2019s going to have to adhere to your schedule. If she wanted to go to the gym so bad, TV could have waited. Almost everything is on demand at this point so her excuse is pretty flimsy.", "NTA.  But chances are she will not be ready to go or to leave the gym when you are and you won't want to wait if she takes longer.  Tell her it  is not going to work.", "I think you might be the last person in the world using a DVR and cable. The rest of us stream shows and can pause and restart anytime.", "I was going to say,  what the hell is this the noughties?", "nta, you're doing her a favor and she's trying to abuse it. when you wouldn't oblige her abuse of your time she got mad", "NTA friend wants to tagalong with your activity, it\u2019s your schedule, stick to it !", "Did you let her know the time beforehand, or did you just text her and expect her to be ready at a moment's notice?", "NTA. You offered to drive and to be a buddy\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean you have to schedule around her to be more flexible.", "NTA. \n\nYou laid out what your expectations were if she wanted to come along with you.\n\nShe's free to do it on her own, if she'd rather do a different schedule. \n\nHowever, I think this is just a case of mismanaged expectations.\n\nShe told you she wanted to go to the gym, and assumed your information was given in sharing a norm before she would join you. She assumed (I assume) that you would take an active role in helping her start at the gym.\n\nHowever, you meant she is welcome to catch a *ride* with you to the gym.\n\nI think your \"come with me or don't go at all\" is more hostile than you meant. As someone with anxiety, on a bad day my brain would interpret that kind of statement as \"come on my schedule or stay out of my gym for good\" (hopefully not what you mean). While it isn't your responsibility to manage her emotions, it's also important to understand how what you say might land.\n\nBut you go to the gym to get your workout in. You're efficient and you have a plan.\n\nIt's clear your friend is expecting much more than just a ride. \n\nIt might be best to take some time to sit down and clear the air. You've been at this for 6 months, but she's just starting. What lessons could you share with her to help her feel empowered to do this on her own?", "It sounds like the two of you have different expectations for the gym activity.  You don\u2019t seem compatible.  Perhaps she can find a closer gym or try some workouts at home to see if she is really willing to be dedicated to a workout schedule like you and with you.  NTA.  Good luck, OP.", "NTA. You are doing her a favor allowing her to tag along when you work out. Your exercise schedule is YOUR time; it's not a point for negotiation or compromise. If she's not ready when you are, she's either not going to the gym that day or she has made other arrangements to get there. With TV shows being available on demand, there's not a valid reason to expect you to pause your life for a TV show.", "NTA.", "NTA beggars can\u2019t be choosers", "Record it and it might be a recording you can stream on your phone. I know the TiVo app kinda sucks but it's better than most", "NTA. That 20 minutes will get extended.", "NTA, she's the one who wants to bum a ride off you", "NTA. Routines are sacred, esp for stuff like the gym", "NTA You are being generous by giving her a ride, that is enough sacrifice on your part. If you give any more concessions to make it easier for her then you would screwing yourself. You have a routine that works for  you. She shouldn't be making demands when she is already getting a free ride. She sounds grossly entitled. Is there any reason you should be kissing her ass?", "Nta", "NTA you do you", "NTA she's not respecting your standards.  It's a life style change to be dedicated to taking care of yourself and she's clearly not ready for it.  And who watches tv anymore?  Everything is streamed now and can't she just record the show?", "NTA, friend is tagging along to your existing routine, you do not have to change your routine for them.", "NTA... stick to it. Next time it would be something else.... The bus leaves at this time, come if you like.....", "NTA.", "NAH. She wants a social get together, you want to work out and keep to a routine. You're not looking for the same things at the gym. If she ever wants to join you, she knows when you'll be there. \n\nThere is no TV program she couldn't DVR, stream later, or just otherwise finish at another time. You have very different priorities.", "No because once I'm in a rhythm of something and it gets broken I just give up altogether. Maybe that's not you but it's me and I live with it \ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffe", "NTA, so annoying", "NTA She's asking for a ride and you set a fair boundary that you can only do it when it fits your schedule. \"Working around each other\" only makes sense if you're both contributing something.", "She wants you to wait until it's convenient for her?  Someone told me that people who make you wait are saying that their time is more important than your time.", "She wants the ride, she needs to accept the timetable. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're doing her a favour offering a lift when you go. You have no obligation to change your routine for her.", "NTA - Easy solution: She walks to the gym. When she reaches the gym she can turn around an walk back home. Saves her the costs for the gym membership and she can do it whenever she wants.", "She wants you to do HER a favor .. \n\nThat means - SHE needs to adapt - not you - otherwise it\\`s more than one favor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA lololol work around each other? Nope.", "lol NTA. Is your friend\u2019s name Princess it Precious because, my word, isn\u2019t she adorable? And manipulative and self centred \n\nYou do you OP. She\u2019s invited herself along essentially, she doesn\u2019t drive, so you\u2019re doing her a favour and she wants you to linger while she watches something on tv? Hell to the no", "\u201cIf you walk to the gym you\u2019ll get your exercise and will arrive in time for me to give you a ride home.\u201d"]}
