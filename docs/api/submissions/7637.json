{"id": 7637, "submission_id": "10exnd9", "title": "AITA for lying to my husband for his own good?", "selftext": "I (45F) have been married to my husband Aaron(46M) for 20 years and he\u2019s never taken care of his health. I\u2019ve gotten tired of begging him to eat better and exercise. I invite to the gym a few times a week and the answer is always no. He also drinks a lot, eats too much fast food, and would rather lie on the couch then go to our son\u2019s (11M) basketball games. A few months ago, he had a health scare that landed us in the ER. It was after midnight on Friday, Aaron hadn\u2019t left the couch all day (called in sick to work), and he was drinking. We got into an argument, which got pretty heated until he collapsed onto the couch because he couldn\u2019t breathe and his chest hurt. I called 911 and, after a scary few hours, he was diagnosed with GERD. Basically heartburn. The doctor said that Aaron could improve his symptoms by eating healthier and quitting alcohol. He recommended a physician and dietician in order to get Aaron on the right track. We were both so relieved, but by the next day, he was drinking again and walked through the door after work with Mcdonald\u2019s. He didn\u2019t seem to understand that the next time could be a real heart attack.\n\nLater, one of my friends called and she asked how Aaron was doing. She is a doctor so I must have spoken to her in medical terms and Aaron overheard me. When I hung up, I realized he thought I was talking to his doctor. I lied and told Aaron that his blood tests came back and that \u201cthings look really bad\u201d. I told him that the doctor estimates he has 4 months to live if he doesn\u2019t improve his health dramatically.\n\nAfter that, Aaron became a different man. He came to the gym with me, shopped for and cooked healthy meals, and spent more time with our son. He lost weight and seemed more happier. One day I came home with his favorite ice cream and i see him with a bottle of alcohol. I was surprised and I asked if he was ok. He confronted me about lying about his health. He ran into his doctor at the gym and the truth came out. He is furious with me and can\u2019t understand how I did it for his own good. He was never going to change without strong motivation. Aaron doesn\u2019t agree and is threatening divorce.

Predictable outcome, tbh.   \n\nSorry, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. You made him afraid he was going to die. When it wasn't true. For *months*. I don't think I would ever forgive someone for that. It would certainly be the end of my marriage, immediately and 100%\n\nI'm not bloody surprised he's talking about divorce. He doesn't trust you anymore, and he has every reason not to. When trust is gone, so is the partnership.", "YTA.\n\nYou told someone they were dying. Sure he improved physically but i can't even imagine the mental toll it would have on him.\n\nI'm calling bs though, no way would he not have made a follow up appointment.", "Oh boy.. I get where you\u2019re probably feeling the ends justify the means.. but ultimately his body is his choice even if it sucks.", "YTA: if it involves lies, you're already TA", "This is a tough one but YTA.\n\nIf you'd asked whether you were the AH for leaving him for refusing to take care of himself, I would have said no. What you did was extraordinarily manipulative. If you had been a friend who wrote this post, I might still have voted not the AH. But marriage is an honor system, in which you expose your most vulnerable places to each other and trust each other not to use them against you. You broke that trust.\n\nYou need to deal with these issues in a much more straightforward way. And apologize for lying and scaring the man. How would you have felt, if instead of his choosing to be healthier, he chose to do all the things he never got to and started running around with hookers and buying things you can't afford? You're cool with it because it got you what you wanted. And you made him  a fool. YTA.", "YTA. Nobody likes to be lied to, whether it's under the guise of for their benefit or not. If you lied to him about this, he has no reason to believe you with anything else. My partner had an ex that did this to him all the time, and always ended with awful emotional fights, followed by a promise to no longer lie for his benefit that was immediately broken in the next week. **Do not** lie for any reason if you want your husband to trust you, but that's long gone now.", "YTA. In some circumstances I could be on your side but making him believe he's on the **cusp of death** is indefensible. What the hell. Mental and Emotional Health matter too and this must be taking a toll on him.", "Yes you are and how many more lies you told him", "YTA. This is a horrible thing to do to anyone, much less your husband. Given that you\u2019ve been married for 20 years, it\u2019s somewhat shocking that you aren\u2019t able to communicate your very valid concerns to your partner in a more constructive way that excludes outright deception. If I were your husband, I would also be considering divorce.", "YTA - Jesus H. Christ you *told him he was going to die in 4 months?* It doesn\u2019t matter how good your intentions were, that is a depraved length to go to. And it\u2019s a slap in the face to everyone out there that actually does have that little time left. This would be a divorce-level betrayal for me\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it is for your husband either.", "YTA\n\nAnd you've now found out exactly why lying to people about their health is a terrible idea.\n\nEnjoy your new life.", "Oh honey yes YTA but I laughed as I read it. How did you think things were going to go? Like seriously, what else did you expect?", "Sorry, but YTA. \n\nHis body, his choice. Been married over 16 years here, and luckily my hubby has a vested self interest in staying healthy lol. Yours doesn't. But that is his issue, not yours. \n\nGet healthy and stay healthy yourself, and let him go ahead and wreck his health if he wants to. After twenty years of him, you should know by now that he is not going to change, and plan accordingly. Now thanks to this he will probably double down on idiot.", "Unbelievable.\n\nHow cruel you were. How frightened he must have been. I feel so sorry for him. YTA in a big way, not only for lying but for the callousness that still insists you were in the right.", "Of course YTA. You manipulated him for your own gain, not his. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be with a lazy alcoholic either, but being a liar and manipulator is even lower.", "ESH and now you're paying the price.  You lied to him about something really serious, the motivation doesn't matter.  What other lies will you deliver \"for his own good.\" \n\nMaybe some couples counseling can help.  Maybe not.\n\nESH because he's not taking care of his health and it sounds like he's got his own underlying issues that he refuses to fix.  (None of which justified the lie.)", "YTA - but I have so many questions about how your husband bought your story about him \u2018having four months live?\u2019 \n\nI mean if things were that sure you\u2019d assume your doctor would want to schedule several immediate appointments with you, and that the dr would want to see Aaron immediately. I don\u2019t get how he just totally changed his life and diet without actually having this verified by a Dr. If I was told I had 4 months to live I\u2019d be scheduling an immediate appt with my dr and whatever specialists to find all the specifics as to HOW EXACTLY my body was failing and what I could to fix the specific issue.", "Gentle YTA. Your heart was in the right place, but lies like the one you told, even white lies, are so easily discovered, as you just found out. And now, it will be nearly impossible to get your husband to do anything about his health. \n\nUnfortunately, your husband has made it clear that he loves alcohol and food more than his family.", "YTA don't lie to your husband about his health. You got caught in a lie and his doctor proved it, you could've just told him it was your friend you were talking to and how she agrees as a doctor he should stop drinking and start hitting the gym but you lied and told him he had 4 months to live if he doesn't change his ways pretending it was his doctor saying those things.", "YTBH. You should have never lied to your husband, especially over something like that. I am sure that you are just worried about him and that you want him to take better care of himself, but you don't catch flies with vinegar. Beating him down and berating him about this is not going to motivate him; it's actually going to cause him even more depression, thus pushing him even deeper into it.\n\n  \nTo be honest with you, if my partner did that to me and caused me unnecessary anxiety, which I already have enough of daily, I would not be very happy. It's a cruel, sick thing to do, even if you thought you were doing the right thing. Put yourself in his shoes: wouldn't it cause you anxiety and fear to think that your death was imminent? And wouldn't you be miffed at him for lying to you? A lot of these silly \"Am I the butthole?\" questions wouldn't need to be asked if people would just put themselves in the other person's shoes for once.", "ESH\n\nYou told a *really big* lie to your husband. Your intention might have been to help him, but in doing so you seriously violated his autonomy.\n\nYou managed to motivate him to take care of his health, but as you learned the motivation was artificial and doesn't last after he stops being afraid of literally dying.\n\nHe is being kinda sucky by not taking care of himself. This sort of judgement gets a bit awkward but I do think he has some obligation to care for himself, because otherwise he will be placing the burden of his care onto those around him. His decision is negatively impacting your life through the worry caused by his declining health, his refusal to engage with family activities, and the potential financial cost to the both of you caused by health complications.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that you cannot control others, you can only control yourself. If he has chosen a path of self-destruction you cannot force him to go otherwise. What you need to do is manage how it impacts *your life*.\n\nIf it seems like his behavior is never going to change (and it is less likely now that you've lied to him) then you need to think about what you need to make the consequences of his decision manageable for you.\n\nLastly, if you can access it, you might seriously consider some form of counseling.\n\n* It sounds like you have a very serious fear about his health that you don't feel is being recognized.\n* He seems to be having some issues taking care of himself (skipping work to drink on the couch, distancing himself from family members to lie on the couch).\n* The trust of your relationship has been severely damaged by your lie\n\nHopefully counseling could help the two of you communicate with each other about these issues, and explore them yourselves.", "YTA. Girl divorce him and move on. If he doesn\u2019t see what his drinking is doing to his family you\u2019ll end up like Fiona taking care of Frank drunk ass.", "YTA.  People should be less gentle about this.\n\nYou would still be gently the asshole if you made up some little lies in order to trick him into eating healthier, like swapping out his food or intentionally overstating the doctor\u2019s guidance.  He\u2019s an adult, he makes his own decisions about food.\n\nLying about only having a few months left to live takes several steps beyond little white lies.\n\nYou inflicted trauma on your husband.  You will have to fight really hard to regain his trust ever again.", "YTA for withholding information to prevent someone from making a clear and conscious choice regarding their medical treatment \"for their own good\". That's called paternalism, and it's bad. Grave breach of morals, trust, and patient autonomy.", "YTA but lmfao serves him right lazy fuck\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "YTA. His life, his health, his choices, and you are his wife not his keeper.", "OMG YTA so he works out and eats well for a while then sees his doctor to confirm improvement and the doctor doesn't know what he's talking about. Make sure you post his reaction when you tell him he was never terminal.", "Ima go with a gentle YTA \n\nI understand the worry and frustration. He had a scare but it didn't affect him one single bit. Lying about something of that magnitude is never ok in my opinion. \n\nMaybe showing him the facts and figures behind the highway from GERD to heart attack and the consequences of those. \n\nLastly. If you can't handle him not looking after himself and not changing. You need to think of your own emotional wellbeing too as well as the roll model your son is seeing. You may not want to hear it but it is what it is. \n\nBest of luck figuring this land mine out!", "YTA\n\n\nJFC. He's a grown man. You're treating him like a naughty child. \n\n\nI would absolutely divorce anyone that did this to me. You obviously don't care about the truth. I'd never be able to believe anything you said ever again.", "YTA, you brought this on yourself by lying to him\u2026 even if it did have a positive outcome when he believed you", "YTA who also happens to be married to one.", "YVMTA.", "YTA\n\nOf course you are.  I don't think it much matters that it's the case, but your husband clearly does", "YTA i hope he goes through with that divorce threat", "YTA. Lying isn't ok.", "Yta\n\nHe is an adult, not a child and you are telling lies.\nIf you cannot respect your SO, then what is the point?", "My (soon to be ex) husband had a heart attack years ago due to poor diet, substance abuse, and other factors all of his own doing. I loved that man more than I thought possible and I can still feel the terror of sitting in a tiny waiting room wondering if he would live or die. I screamed and cried more than I ever had before and the pain ripping through me was more than I could handle. I never left the hospital except once to get him the cigarettes and food he insisted on. When we came home from the hospital I didn't sleep and I watched him while he slept because I was so terrified he would die. He never noticed. Within a week he was back to eating fast food three times a day and his substance abuse. The first time I saw him doing drugs again it felt like something died inside me and I was fundamentally changed. I can't explain the way it twisted up my heart and I haven't been the same person since. \nAre you the AH for lying to him...yeah sure you are, of course. But I can't say I don't understand you.", "ESH, but honestly the fact that he just went right back to his bad habits without a single care is\u2026 alarming. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have lied but I understand why you did. The bigger issue is the effect his lack of care around his health is having on you. Are you talking to anybody? I imagine this is super stressful watching your husband laze his way into an early grave and he doesn\u2019t seem to care. Your husband clearly has other issues going on.", "YTA for literally copying this video: \nhttps://youtu.be/w_nzwa3n70A", "Absolutely ESH - Your husband sounds like a lazy selfish AH and I'm sorry for that but I struggle to think of any time it would be acceptable to lie about a doctor telling someone they have 4 months to live lol, that's horrific, even if the intention was (mostly) benevolent. That's just... wrong on so many levels", "YTA. You don't get to manipulate people like that for your own agenda.\n\nWhat else have you been lying to him about?", ">\u201cthings look really bad\u201d\n\nHahaha, I love your chutzpah.

I have a feeling lots of redditors are young. But having lived a while, I can tell you that free will is not as free as we like to think. We have so many responsibilities as adults.
