You say that the boys love visiting there. Whilst I understand as an adult the rules that your Dad (or largely, his missus) are imposing are harsh and dramatic it doesn't appear to have impeded their enjoyment which I think is important. It seems like you don't like being there, which is completely understandable, but they do. As such, I'm a gentle YTA. \n\nPerhaps there's some kind of compromise to be made. Visit less, ask if they can babysit so you don't have to stay, encourage them to visit you etc.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYour children are all old and cognitively aware enough to (at a minimum) feel like they are being treated well, or badly.\n\nI would use this as a teaching lesson to help guide them towards becoming functional adults who will not only be able to make their own healthy decisions but, in turn, teach their children the same values which you are trying to instill now.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA by the way you describe it, it doesn\u2019t seem like your dad actually wants a relationship with your children. If you don\u2019t feel welcome your children also don\u2019t feel welcome even if they don\u2019t know yet how to verbalized that.", "NTA. Do they ask you to go round amd visit? Sounds like they don't really want to see you tbh. They sound a lot like my inlaws.", "NTA", "You WNBTA. \n\n\u201cDad, I love seeing you and giving you a chance to see your grandkids, but restricting us to only the kitchen is not fair or realistic. I don\u2019t feel comfortable coming over if I\u2019m made to feel like less than a guest. I would love to have you over more often at my house, where you don\u2019t need to worry about the kids making a mess. I\u2019d just really love to be able to spend some unrestricted time with you and the kids.\u201d", "NTA their house isn't kid friendly which is fine, their prerogative. It's also your prerogative to not go somewhere you and your kids aren't welcome. If they want to see you, they can either come to you or ease up on their rules. They can't have it both ways. This is vaguely reminiscent of the people that have childfree weddings then get upset when people with children can't attend. It's fine to not want kids at your wedding, it's not fine to get mad at people for following your rules. Just like it's fine to not have a child friendly home but it's not fine to get upset when people with kids won't come over anymore.", "Nta partner is making the experience terrible and if the kids don\u2019t notice now they will", "Just ask the kids what they want \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f take the ones who do want to go and leave the ones who don't at home.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his wife make their home a priority over your sons feelings. It's their right to do that but you are not an asshole for not allowing it. Also your dad might come over to your home more often if you stop coming to his house. \n\nIt's your job to prioritize your sons, their well being and their feelings. Don't let anyone tell you differently.", "YTA. Why are they walking around eating cookies and making a mess? You should have been the one following them around cleaning up after them, not her. Children not being allowed on certain furniture is not a big deal, and they should be learning to respect other's boundaries. \n\nThe boys love visiting the farm according to you. So their restrictions must not be bothering them all that much.", "NTA. A kitchen is a small area to be confined for 4 boys and yourself. Then add your dad or his partner in the room as well. I would suggest meeting somewhere neutral like a park or something.", "They like playing outside and going for tractor rides. They used to love playing with the toys at my dad's house, but now they are not allowed to ( the only being allowed in the kitchen is a new rule) . So are they just supposed to sit at the table on their hands while his partner makes passive agressive comments about me?", "This, the children should be able to tell you if they're being mistreated. \n\nAlso is there a reason for yall not getting along in the first place? Kinda needing more info on that. Was it because your kids are misbehaving in the first place or did she do something??\n\nYTA until we get more context", "I have thought about it, he says he has to much work to do, can't stay etc.", "This is the only right answer\n\nNTA", "Then that\u2019s pretty telling that he doesn\u2019t care enough to see his grandchildren (or you). So it\u2019s up to you to decide what you want to do with that information. Are you sure he wouldn\u2019t change his mind if he knew you weren\u2019t going to be coming by his place anymore?"]}
