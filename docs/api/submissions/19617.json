You say that the boys love visiting there.

It seems like you don't like being there, which is completely understandable, but they do. As such, I'm a gentle YTA. \n\nPerhaps there's some kind of compromise to be made.

It's also your prerogative to not go somewhere you and your kids aren't welcome. If they want to see you, they can either come to you or ease up on their rules. They can't have it both ways. This is vaguely reminiscent of the people that have childfree weddings then get upset when people with children can't attend.

They don\u2019t understand why grandpa has these rules and the 12 year old will remember a time before the new rules so it\u2019ll be more confusing.  It sucks having to end visits but maybe offer to pick up your dad to bring him over if that\u2019s easier.  Every two weeks do a grandpa day where he\u2019s over all day at your house.

Is he the one that asks for visits? Maybe the stroke makes it hard for him to deal with the noise that 4 kids can cause?! If he wants your kids to visit than you can calmly explain to him that the restrictions his girlfriend gives them give you the idea that they are not welcome.

Bring a picnic and eat outside. Perhaps there is someplace near his home where you can all go, such as a playground or other child-friendly place. Also, shorten your visits. It's better to leave when everyone wants to stay than when everyone is on their last nerve. This is a big stress reducer. Works for me in a similar situation.", "I'm not sure what your father's limitations are since his stroke, but I am guessing that his partner is bearing most responsibilities in the house, caring for your father AND working full time. If that is the case, then possibly the partner's stress is at its peak and anything on top of that is too much. So, my suggestion is to invite them over to your place, that way your boys can run around and do whatever and still see your father and maybe this will be less stressful for the partner, too.", "INFO: have you actually asked anybody about the weirdness in this situation?

There might be a perfectly reasonable explanation", "NTA\n\nKids are gonna be kids, as long as they aren\u2019t actually being feral and tearing the place apart they should be allowed to relax while visiting their grandfather.

They aren\u2019t allowed to sit on the furniture,they can\u2019t play on the floor and they can\u2019t eat so are they expected to hover perfectly still and be hungry when they visit? Their expectations are way too high for kids.", "NTA. I grew up with a stepmother like this, my father did nothing about it.

I would tell my Dad that the kids love coming over but if they are going to be confined to one space or not allowed to move around then we have to leave and he can come over to your place if he wants time with them. \nTake em over and play outside, when they go in stay 10 mins and then say its time to go. If they care they\u2019ll pick up on it. \nMy granddad and my step-grandma were like this.

Are they also made to feel unwelcome in his house? Do you feel comfortable leaving them (safely) for a bit under dad's partner's supervision, as long as you're nearby?\n\nAlso worth nothing that it doesn't have to be all or nothing. You can figure out ways for the kids to see their grandpa without sacrificing your mental health or jeopardizing the safety/wellbeing of your kids. \n\nYou definitely shouldn't have to shoulder the entire burden of the relationship. It sounds like despite his stroke, he's still able to visit every once in a while. Maybe it's worth having an honest conversation with him to make it clear that you don't feel comfortable there, still want the kids to have a relationship with him, and want to come up with a solution/compromise.", "NTA.

Maybe it's time to ask (in a fun \"What's the best part about going to Grampys?!?\" way).  Find out if they really enjoy it or what they enjoy.  If they really do want to continue, do you have to stay there with them?   I know four is young and four kids is a lot but unless you're concerned for their safety, maybe it's time to let them have some alone time there.  Could you go to a nearby coffee shop or library?  If Grampy and partner can't handle the kids without you, that may take care of the question right there.  If Grampy still wants time and they can't handle the kids alone, that gives you some bargaining power over their rules.  If they can handle the kids and the kids are having fun, they get their Grampy time and you don't have to sit around miserable while they do.  If you can find a compromise between your comfort and the kids having their time, that's in everyone's best interests.", "You would only be TA if you stopped visiting your father with your children.

Bottom line is you aren't welcome there. As grandparents if they want the kids to visit then they need to be available to watch them and engage with them but also need to make an effort or work with you to make their house safe and welcoming while protecting their things. \n\nWe have a toddler and another one on the way and the contrast between my parents house and my in laws is stark. My parents have childproofed their house and have piles of quilts and towels for furniture and they let me keep toys in their garage. By contrast my in laws refuse to childproof (even if we pay for it) and they have drawers full of knives right at my toddler's eye level. They leave the door to their basement wide open when they could close it... I've found them staring at their phones while my daughter was playing with ammonia and bleach. Like what the actual fuck?! So guess what- visits at their house are not a thing. They live five minutes down the road and if they want to visit then they come over to our house where our kid is safe. And I don't have to come out of the bathroom to find her playing on the kitchen floor with a serrated knife. Like no. Their house is just over for us. If they made changes then we would change this stance. So I can relate to your dad and his wife really not having a welcoming environment for your kids. I can't imagine your 12 year old looks forward to this. \n\nPersonally, I think cut out the visits to their house unless the kids and grandparents can spend time in the yard or something. Invite them over to your place more often. Host a BBQ or something. Maybe if they stay long enough to eat you can get more than a ten minutes to get a visit in for the kids. Invite your dad to meet you guys out and about close to his place. Take him to lunch or something.

She wouldn\u2019t let me leave the living room, wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the bathroom, and always had a maid follow me. At least that\u2019s how it began. Eventually, it went to a point where if my cousin was hungry, he\u2019d ask her for food, she\u2019d take him aside, then gently tell him to wait until I left, \u2018cuz God forbid, I ask for some too. \n\nWhen my mom caught wind of it, she was piiiissssseeeeeddddd. You see, my dad is a very family-oriented guy, and because he knew I spent my most active times downstairs with my grandma and cousin (everyone else was at work usually), he did ALL of the grocery for them too. So much so that it limited OUR spending. \n\nSafe to say, my mom tried to keep me upstairs for some time, however, when my cousin would inevitably come up to our door, I would start to cry. He was my best friend. So, my mom packed my bags, and soon I was living with her sister, and my other cousin (maternal), and I back to myself, and this time, I didn\u2019t need to climb two sets of stairs, into another apartment to use the bathroom. My grandma became offended when I unceremoniously disappeared, and after multiple heated conversations with my mom and dad, she apologized and my aunt hired another maid, who always had food and drinks for me when I came back.\n\nIt taught me one thing: I am a human being deserving of respect.

As kids, we weren't allowed to play in the house. We were yelled at for \"running\" in the house when only moving fast. We were very limited as to what she was okay with in her house. I'm not saying this is the same as a stroke, but neurological diseases can have some significant changes in personality. Also, a decrease in patience is very common with personality changes.
