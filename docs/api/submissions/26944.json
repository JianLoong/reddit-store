For $1, It was pretty much just as good as what would have cost me $5 to make and an hour, so it became a regular cheat.\n\nWhen I was in my 30s, I went back to college and pie crusts take time - but it was always on me to make the pumpkin and pecan pie and Mom wanted ALL her pies. So, I made a deal with Mom, she buys premade crusts, and I will buy the fillings and make the pies. I had those two puppies in the oven in under 30 minutes, because I showed up Wednesday night and they had to be cooked then, as it was all Turkey in the oven the next day. My older brother who made the apple and blueberry pies from scratch was a bit salty. The pies were fine. The premade crusts weren't quite as good, but they gave me back time I didn't have.\n\nMy point being, family meals are ultimately about family. If gender expectations are so rigid that no one can enjoy the meal because you and your husband don't play by their rules, then it's their loss.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Their reaction was inappropriate, so I won\u2019t give them a pass on that.  But it was also pretty hostile of you to tell them to change their entire approach to family meals and then refuse to participate when they wouldn\u2019t do it your way.  You could have agreed to help out but asked to do simpler tasks since cooking isn\u2019t your thing, and then just had a conversation while you all put the meal together - a lot of families bond that way, and it seems like your husband\u2019s family is one of them.
