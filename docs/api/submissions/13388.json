I had a stroke last year, which was stressful, but I am doing well. I had aphasia as a side effect. I pass as normal to most people. Since the stroke our communication is worse. Sometimes when I talk to her, she says I'm mean, and she cries and I have no idea why. I don\u2019t know if I'm misspeaking, or she's sensitive, or if something I say is actually mean. This didn\u2019t happen much before the stroke, but it happens a lot now. I try to be nice when we talk. \n\nToday, I took my kids to swim class. I got there and realized I had forgotten towels. I texted my wife, and she offered to go home and get towels and bring them to me. I replied thanking her.\n\nI got the kids in the pool, and called her. She was still at work, and said her car was blocked in and she was finding the person who blocked her in. Her coworkers were getting her towels and she would come to the pool when she could. I didn't hear from her for 15 minutes. I considered asking the front desk for towels, or sun-drying the kids, but I was just stuck because I didn't know if my wife was coming. I know some people would handle the uncertainty better, but it stressed me out. She showed up with the towels, we talked, and she left. I didn't say much because I was feeling upset and am very careful if I'm upset and talking to my wife.\n\nWhen she got home, she offered to finish dinner and put down the kids, since she knew I had been with them all afternoon. I said sure, since I still had some work left. I asked if it was ok to talk, and she said ok. I told her I feel like I can't trust her when I ask her to do something because she won\u2019t update me if there are unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI was careful to say I wasn\u2019t criticizing her, just sharing how I felt. I could tell she was upset. I asked her if she understood me, and she repeated it back to me. It sounded like she understood.\n\nI asked her if I said something mean. She said that she didn\u2019t blame me, but that it hurt her feelings that I would complain to her without thanking her or thinking about how hard she worked to get me the towels. I told her that I DID thank her, I immediately texted \u201cthank you\u201d when she said she would come. She also said something sarcastic like \u201cand you\u2019re welcome for coming home and offering to take the kids!\u201d\n\nWhat does my gratitude have to do with not trusting her? I appreciate everything she does for me. The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings. If she does that for me, then I can only feel gratitude. So I told her not to bother. I also said something like \"don't do me any favors\", which I guess is not the nicest choice of words.\n\nI think she\u2019s the AH because she is self absorbed, and can\u2019t be there for me when I have negative emotions. I think I might be the AH because she\u2019s upset and I know she tries to give me the benefit of the doubt, and if so I'm hoping reddit can explain it to me.", "created_utc": 1680009244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124oddw/aita_telling_my_wife_i_cant_trust_her_after_she/", "score": 12164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem ungrateful in this post. She didn't do anything wrong, but you said you don't trust her? I truly think you could benefit from therapy. I feel bad for your wife. You sound draining for her to deal with.", "INFO: Since you've acknowledged asking the front desk for towels was an option why did you contact your wife who was at work?", "Alright so hate to break it to you but YTA. \n\nTo me It sounds like she was trying to be incredibly supportive and helpful and you basically emotionally punished her for it. \n\nIt was 15 minutes that you didn\u2019t hear from her. That\u2019s not very long and more than likely she was busy trying to fix the situation of being blocked in etc. the more she stops to update you the longer it takes to fix the situation.

You then chased her twice as she tried to rectify your error, and when you got home berated her for what? Not calling you within 15 minutes? It\u2019s towels, not life-threatening medication. \n\nYour stroke has nothing to do with this.

That\u2019s absurd.", "You thanked her once, when she first agreed. You did not thank her at all for ALL of the work she had to put in to getting you those towels, tho. She had a coworker get the towels (coworker deserves a thank you, too.) She had to chase down whoever blocked her car in, she had to likely finish up some work stuff before being able to leave etc. \n\nAnd you're mad she didn't stop IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT HECTIC STUFF to message you WHY she was taking so long. \n\nHave patience, and trust she is trying her best. \n\nThen she knows it was stressful for *you* so she offers to take over kid duty that evening. Instead of just being thankful, you also had to admonish her way of handling your request. \n\nYou forgot the towels, not her. She was at WORK.

It sounds like you created a stressful situation for yourself and then you not only dragged her into it, you found a way to blame her for the way you felt/acted. Bringing the kids AND their towels to swim class was your responsibility. But instead, she had to leave work (presumably early or in the middle of her day) to deal with the situation that you created. \n\nNot having towels at swim class is hardly an emergency situation - you two did not need to be in constant communication about it. And TBH, it was something you could have dealt with on your own. You could have asked the front desk for towels or asked another parent if they could share/had extras. Depending on the age of your kids, you could have even gone home to get the towels while they had their lesson. \n\nYou need therapy to learn how to deal with your negative emotions without dumping them or blaming them on your partner. The fact that you frequently make her cry now MAY be due to your medical issues. The fact that you occasionally made her cry BEFORE your stroke is something else entirely.", "Uhm \n\nUh\n\nYTA\n\nYou asked for towels and your wife bought them. She was at work at the time and was blocked in for 15 extra minutes. \n\n15 minutes is not a long time OP.\n\nSeems like you and your wife have lost your means of communication.

Go see a counselor for heaven's sake.", "YTA\n\nYour wife did you numerous favors to make up for *your* mistake and instead of being appreciative, you declared her \"untrustworthy.\" (And at any point did you apologize for forgetting the towels and inconveniencing your wife?) She went above and beyond, only to get criticized for failing to meet your standards.\n\nLook, when's the last time you worked with a therapist or talked to your neurologist? Because it sounds like the stroke impacted your ability to empathize and see things from other people's perspective. That's a really bad weak spot when it comes to marriage and co-parenting. Biting your tongue to prevent yourself from accidentally sounding \"mean\" clearly isn't enough. If you don't learn how to work around your emotional blindspots, your marriage is doomed.", "YTA you forgot the towels and she went out of her way while SHE WAS AT WORK.

Wife, while at work, took off and struggled to get out to get the towels you forgot to bring and you got upset she was a bit late despite explaining why.\n\nI'm very certain she was with you while recovering from your stroke (which I'm sorry you suffered through), and did her utmost to help you there. Yet here you are accusing her of being self absorbed.\n\n...Almost forgot, this is about *friggin' towels.* The worst that would happen is your car seats would have been a bit wet.

Has anyone suggested that when you get upset you stop and analyze why and try to critically think the situation through without trying to assess blame first? If not, then you should start doing so.  \n\nFurther to tell your spouse you cannot trust them over a delay on bringing towels to a pool while they are at work, which you forgot, is the height of asinine behavior.", "YTA.

Think ab how much your wife had to put up with you without you hearing on ounce of criticism. I\u2019m sure she was there during your recovery, made extreme sacrifices, and as stated she has sat through you making her feel like shit, etc. you lose trust her in just for forgetting towels when in reality, she was trying her hardest to bring you towels and outside factors stopped it. It sounds like you need to reevaluate your reactions", "YTA. You can\u2019t trust her because she didn\u2019t update you on the towel situation as she was trying to find someone who blocked her in?

Before or after you decided to treat her like a damned child?", "YTA.  Please consider that your behavior/tone of voice may have changed considerably since your stroke.  You may not be fully aware of this.  Your wife is probably not able to verbalize what has changed very well and you may both need counseling to get through this.  \n\nUnfortunately, I know two people who have had serious strokes that left them very changed.  One has completely lost his mental filter and basically can't go out in public alone because he's constantly saying things that would get him arrested if there isn't someone there to explain.

She was literally doing her best to get you the towels, and you freaked out after 15 minutes.

Could there have been more damage caused by the stroke that they\u2019re unaware of? Your response was not normal. You should not have been so upset after a short delay, especially after your wife said she was on her way. \n\nIf the neurologist doesn\u2019t find anything else, please see a therapist.

Never mind that she\u2019s at WORK and trying to fix YOUR mistake. \n\nLook, I think you should talk to your doctor. Strokes can cause major anxiety post-recovery and it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re struggling with an emotional issue and taking it out on your wife.

I had a stroke last year, which was stressful, but I am doing well. I had aphasia as a side effect. I pass as normal to most people. Since the stroke our communication is worse. Sometimes when I talk to her, she says I'm mean, and she cries and I have no idea why. I don\u2019t know if I'm misspeaking, or she's sensitive, or if something I say is actually mean. This didn\u2019t happen much before the stroke, but it happens a lot now. I try to be nice when we talk. \n\nToday, I took my kids to swim class. I got there and realized I had forgotten towels. I texted my wife, and she offered to go home and get towels and bring them to me. I replied thanking her.\n\nI got the kids in the pool, and called her. She was still at work, and said her car was blocked in and she was finding the person who blocked her in. Her coworkers were getting her towels and she would come to the pool when she could. I didn't hear from her for 15 minutes. I considered asking the front desk for towels, or sun-drying the kids, but I was just stuck because I didn't know if my wife was coming. I know some people would handle the uncertainty better, but it stressed me out. She showed up with the towels, we talked, and she left. I didn't say much because I was feeling upset and am very careful if I'm upset and talking to my wife.\n\nWhen she got home, she offered to finish dinner and put down the kids, since she knew I had been with them all afternoon. I said sure, since I still had some work left. I asked if it was ok to talk, and she said ok. I told her I feel like I can't trust her when I ask her to do something because she won\u2019t update me if there are unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI was careful to say I wasn\u2019t criticizing her, just sharing how I felt. I could tell she was upset. I asked her if she understood me, and she repeated it back to me. It sounded like she understood.\n\nI asked her if I said something mean. She said that she didn\u2019t blame me, but that it hurt her feelings that I would complain to her without thanking her or thinking about how hard she worked to get me the towels. I told her that I DID thank her, I immediately texted \u201cthank you\u201d when she said she would come. She also said something sarcastic like \u201cand you\u2019re welcome for coming home and offering to take the kids!\u201d\n\nWhat does my gratitude have to do with not trusting her? I appreciate everything she does for me. The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings. If she does that for me, then I can only feel gratitude. So I told her not to bother. I also said something like \"don't do me any favors\", which I guess is not the nicest choice of words.\n\nI think she\u2019s the AH because she is self absorbed, and can\u2019t be there for me when I have negative emotions. I think I might be the AH because she\u2019s upset and I know she tries to give me the benefit of the doubt, and if so I'm hoping reddit can explain it to me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Similar to you, he had a hard time understanding subtext and emotional implications and when I would be talking to him after the stroke and crying he would just change the subject or not understand what was needed from him. This has gotten better over the years but we still occasionally have to discuss behavior that is different now than before. He was in an all day rehab program for a month which helped significantly (we called it daddy daycare lol). It didn't solve all his problems but helped with the biggest ones. We also did couples therapy a few months after which was helpful in helping each of us to understand where the other was coming from. Communication became even more important and if I was upset I had to specifically say something. He had to work on not getting defensive and either pointing out why he didn't feel I was right or accepting what I was saying had merit. Strokes are so incredibly difficult and I really encourage you to seek out all the resources you can for yourself. He's now developing symptoms similar to ADHD but can't take ADHD meds (which have shown to be beneficial to people with TBIs) because of his BP but if it's an option for you consider that too.", "You\u2019re calling your wife self absorbed? Kettle calling the pot black much?", "YTA\n\nI have great sympathy for you having to live with the effects of your stroke.  But I'm going to be blunt. You are asking your wife to compensate for you, and it's not appropriate if you want to have a healthy marriage. \n\nShe's been crying a lot.  Probably because it isn't that you're saying awful things to her, and this is the only problem. But she has the added responsibility of taking care of YOU too, now, and she's burning out.\n\nIf my husband was is the same position, as you were, and he text me that he'd forgotten towels, my answer would be \"So figure something out.\"\n\nTowels are not such an emergency that I would leave work to bring them to you, because you could just get some from the desk. Or the kids sun dry.  It was not an important situation that requires her involvement.\n\nThat you say you can't trust her now?  Dude. I was YOUR judgement of the situation that was flawed.  Grown ups just SOLVE little problems like this, by themselves.\n\nAnd I expect this is how you have been living your life, and that's why she's crying.  You have become ultra dependent upon her, and your judgement of situations, and what her involvement should be, is definitely screwed up.\n\nSo reach out for appropriate therapy to create a new environment in which you are more independent, encourages making good judgements, and reduces the weight of responsibility for her.\n\nI get that you have a problem you cannot help. You must learn how to compensate YOURSELF.", "Not quite the same perhaps but my husband suffered from a traumatic brain injury a few years ago as a result of a fall.

It\u2019s hard to explain and those that don\u2019t know him well before and after may not even notice. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is that he is a bit more \u201cclingy\u201d and he is more impatient. He wants things done as he thinks of them or is doing them and if he needs my assistance it sort has to be then and there. I\u2019m not sure that he\u2019s cognizant of it himself and explaining it to him is difficult. \n\nWe talk about it from time to time so he has some realization of it and can process it a bit to correct himself in these instances. \n\nIs this behavior that would have been typical of you pre-stroke?  If not, then you may need to consider that you have some after effects of the stroke that should be dealt with. Perhaps talking to a doctor or therapist could help. \n\nIt sounds like your wife acted in a very normal and rational way and for you to NOT trust her now seems to be an overreaction.

You need to ask your doctor if this mental stress, impatience, and lack of empathy is an expected side effect of your stroke recovery. Then, you need to contact a therapist who can help you manage this stress while you hopefully continue to heal. I have sympathy for your situation. Based on your wife's reactions that you described early in the post, it sounds like you may be behaving in a way that she finds unexpected. Personality changes after traumatic brain issues are very common, as I understand. You understand this, I'm sure, but you really need to take stock of the fact that you might be acting very differently than you did before, and that it may upset people. If you can establish that this is a medical condition, you and your wife will have a foundation to work from. The situation you described does not warrant the emotions and reaction you had. She dropped everything to help you, 15 minutes is not a long time if she's dealing with extenuating circumstances, and she is not obligated to update you every 5 minutes in order to support you when you \"have negative emotions.\" Handling your negative emotions is YOUR job.\n\n>The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings.

Okay, have you done anything to make sure that never happens again? You need to make a \"take kids swimming\" checklist. If you find yourself needing help getting stuff like that done correctly, you need to make lots of checklists, shopping lists, to-do lists, calendars, etc.\n\nYou upset your wife. What could you have done differently? You could have thanked her for dropping everything to bail you out. Make a checklist: before bringing up new topic, is there anything you should be thanking your wife for? And speaking of new topics, instead of telling her how you felt (and honestly, do women really want to hear about men's feelings? They may say they do, but in my experience: for most women, only if they're romantic feelings) ask her advice. She said she'd bring towels. She'll probably say \"if I say I'm going to do something I will, stop expecting blow-by-blow texts.\" Take that onboard. You need to deal with your own anxiety, not offload it onto her.\n\nThink \"Memento\". That guy had serious brain damage, and he developed ways to compensate. You need to be like that.

Give more love, and less criticism.", "You seem super entitled to your wife\u2019s time and by this story I cannot imagine that if the roles were reversed that you would accept being at your wife\u2019s beck and call so thanklessly.

People leave their partners all the time when the other one gets sick (luckily for you, men are much more likely to do it). But it seems like you\u2019re gonna blow up over something as stupid as not getting a text in 15 MINUTES, after your wife dropped everything to get you some towels, your marriage is not gonna last when your condition worsens.

It does not seem necesary or grateful to tell her you can't trust her because you had at least 2 other options to solve your problem in case she was not there. You texted your wife at work becuse you forgot towels so she could solve your issue which seems a little unnecessary.  She followed through on what she said she would do pretty quickly and was very considerate of you by finishing dinner and taking over with the kids when she got home. Nothing you describe makes her seem untrustworthy, self absorbed or an AH.\n\nIf you find it too stressful to ask your wife to do favors when you can't see her or get constant updates then just don't.

Your wife is trying to be supportive but you keep kicking her in the teeth with your complaints that she\u2019s not good enough.

YTA", "YTA but this is something you and your wife need to talk about in therapy. Not communicating for fifteen minutes, presumably when she's driving over, is unfair to her, especially when she told you very quickly what the hold -ups were.\n\nMy dad had a traumatic brain injury a few months ago and is recovering with aphasia right now. It definitely hurts communication. It's not just the word mix-ups, it's the fact that he'll say something, we'll misunderstand because the wrong words came out, and everyone feels like they communicated perfectly when in reality, we were having two different conversations entirely. Yesterday, he asked if I put his card back in his wallet. An hour later, I realized he was actually asking if I put his leftovers in the fridge. I understand that a stroke and aphasia lead to difficulties that you likely never had to worry about before.\n\nHowever, this isn't a communication issue. At least, not that you've described. This isn't her making assumptions about what you mean, or not listening to you, or unfairly coddling you. You asked for a favor, she did the favor. I really don't see why you felt so poorly about her afterward. If you actually don't trust her, after she drops work and brings you towels and is only MIA for fifteen minutes, then you need to address that head on and not blame her when she hasn't done anything wrong.", "YTA for sure. Sounded like wife was doing her best to get the towels to you asap, that you forgot, and in trying to hurry, didn't think to stop and update you at every step.

Maybe next time, just let me know and I'll go to the front desk and ask for a couple so you don't have to go through all of that.\" Then NTA, but this wasn't the case.", "YTA. It\u2019s funny you would try and call her self absorbed, when she went to a lot of effort to leave work and do you a favor. It sounds like her running behind was out of her control, and had she stopped to text you a play by play, it would have just taken even longer. Idk if you being so selfish is a result of your stroke, but you should probably find a way to stop being so critical and negative or you\u2019ll just end up divorced when your wife decides she\u2019s done being talked down to.", "You forgot the towels and your wife dropped everything to bring them to you.\n\nShe got blocked in and was trying to find the person to set her free, whilst arranging for her coworkers to find towels to replace the ones that you forgot.\n\nYou then told her you didn't trust her be because she didn't update you, while she was trying to find a solution to a problem you created, when she was supposed to be at work\n\nYou shouldn't even have bothered her and just borrowed towels from the gym.\n\nI hope that explains why YTA in this situation.", "Your wife left work, went home, and brought you towels because you packed irresponsibly.

He can barely talk at this point.  And yes having the stroke, and likly his inability to communicate with us, can give him a short fuse which is super weird because he was the biggest sweetheart teddy bear of a guy before hand.  And most of the time still is.  But you know what?  That\u2019s not what happened to you.  You admit that you said mean things to your wife before the stroke.  Then you took out your frustration about your mess up on your wife after she fixed your problem.  It doesn\u2019t matter what words you used to talk to her about it, the fact that you were trying to tell her that you can\u2019t trust (or rely on as some people are thinking this is a word mix up but frankly it doesn\u2019t matter) her because she took a whole 15 min to fix your mistake is you being a jerk and making your F**k ups her problem.  You clearly communicated what you wanted to communicate.  And what you wanted to communicate make you the AH.  Also stop using the aphasia as an excuse for being a jerk to your wife when you say you can pass as normal to most poeple.  If you can pass as normal that means you aren\u2019t communicating that badly, which means if you are mean to your wife that\u2019s because you are a mean person.  Get therapy.

And apparently all that effort wasn\u2019t good enough and she did it wrong?? Enough to complain about, and not only that, but say she isn\u2019t trustworthy? I mean it comes off like you think your shit is pure gold. And her dinner and devotion are pure shit. Please get both therapy and some occupational medicine help to deal with your impressive (now unfiltered) male entitlement and whatever effects the stroke is having on you.", "**If this story is how you treat your wife all the time, you are abusive.**\n\nYour wife in this story went above and beyond to fix a problem **you** created by forgetting the towels, only to be met with criticism because you had to wait for 15 minutes without constant communication. In fact, you went so far as so say that because you had to wait and it stressed you out, that you can't trust her to help you. You made your problem her problem, and blamed her for not fixing it.\n\nYou and your wife need to schedule an appointment with your neurologist to see if these personality changes are permanent, or if this is something that can be resolved.

It could be due to the stroke but that doesn\u2019t make you less of an AH it\u2019s just a reason. Reasons are not excuses. You were quite ungrateful and horrible, and thanking someone in advance is not the same as thanking them after they do something for you, never mind that your request became more difficult (her being boxed in) and taking more time and effort for her to do than initially though.\n\nYou are showing 0 appreciation and frankly you need to work harder on it. If this is a typical day for you and how you handle interactions with your wife, there is no reason for her to stick around. So do better. Work on it. When she tells you you are being mean, note what you said and how you said it, use it as an example of what not to say in future. \n\nHeck if you need more time to process then say that and then have a think about how you want to respond.\nRight now you\u2019ve provided an example of your negative emotions from a situation you caused being justification for you blaming your wife for it.

It's clear her mental state has nothing to do with his medical condition and evrything to do with how he's doubled down on controlling and antagonizing behavior since his stroke.\n\nI'll also point out that this kind of abusive behavior is very sophisticated and takes some foresight and planning so it's ridiculous that OP is trying to pass this all off as if it's a result of brain damage.", "Not just complaining but telling her he *could no longer trust her* after she scrambled to fix his mistake as quick as she could.", "Here's \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 for putting it so well\n\nYTA OP", "I feel like this has to be the stroke, right?

He is clearly doing his best to try to work around his new way of thinking and deal with the emotions from that without hurting his wife and she seems to be doing her best to handle things as well but struggling with how he handles things now. I think if they could find a couples therapist with an interest in neurology, they might be able to work out a new way to communicate that works well for both of them, but they have to understand exactly what is going on in his brain now and what deficits in thinking that creates, the same way I've had to figure out how to accommodate the deficits created by ADHD.", "I\u2019m sad for her.

You seem to be having difficulty with a basic concept of marriage. Trust... a therapist may be helpful and they have magics wait lists in most places still. I would recommend talking to one for yourself and maybe even one for the two of you together.", "OP, you sound like you've lost some sense of empathy. Your behaviors and responses demonstrate a lack of empathy. It's not far fetched that you need to consider that your stroke impacted your prefrontal cortex or other related areas that are in control of emotions, memories, etc. You yourself are stating you can't be trusted to remember simple things. If your memory is impacted, so are all the other related areas. \n\nWhile counseling for you two is a good idea, you need to make an appointment with your doctor, explain these symptoms you are experiencing, and request an MRI to see if this is either lasting damage or something that will return over time. \n\nYou also need to have a frank conversation with your wife about this as this isn't an \"asshole\" situation as much as a traumatic brain injury situation. She DESERVES to know that your behavior is physiological more than psychological. \n\nWith that said, that doesn't excuse you from not trying to exercise emotions and empathy, nor does it allow you to make it an excuse for how you act or what you say. So don't do that. This isn't your fault, but it is your responsibility. Don't attempt to put the burden of understanding on her when you act in callous and non-empathetic ways. Also, don't sweep this under the rug. Once you have a stroke, especially at your age, you are at increased risk for other strokes as well as \"mini-strokes\". Behavior changes, however slight they may appear, need to be reported to your neurologist and needs to be investigated. Don't let someone hand wave you off and say \"well, let's see if it gets better first\". That's a great way to miss something and get something that could have been temporary become permanent. Get a damn MRI at the very least.", "Well then if it wasn't harsh I don't understand why it's a big deal you needed to tell your wife.

But you can't be trusted to do the job right in the first place that put her in a situation where she had to leave work.\n\nWhy be frustrated at her for something you're way more incompetent at. That's like someone who can't read or write complaining that their wife misspelled a word.\n\nAlso take a step back, telling someone you can't trust them is a very harsh thing in general. Trust is a integral part of a relationship, to tell your spouse you can't *trust* them?! The person you've been physically, financially, emotionally vulnerable with and planned to live with your entire life, you can't trust them. Just bc you didn't get a omw while they were scrambling to get to you for a non emergency. It's like you expected her to move the heavens and the earth and let you know exactly when she was doing each at each precise moment\n\nAs someone who suffers from anxiety, is impatient etc, I used to get really panicky anytime my partner left the house. Id be calculating the exact time it takes to get to a particular store, the eta of the shopping and time it gets back to come home and then a cushion for traffic and I would always freak out if a 10 minute trip turned into 30 minutes. Id question him up and down, not bc I thought he was cheating but my mind was like how can it possibly take X amount of time to do Y. Then I learned I was the problem, I had the problem.

This may be an executive function issue from your stroke. And the way the uncertainty while waiting upset i think is secondary to you\u2019re adapting to an EF impairment. Like you are constantly questioning because you lack confidence in your own judgment, which is extremely stressful, and that kind of ongoing stress is going to make anyone more temperamental. \n\nYou need to relearn some problem solving skills (stop, consider options, weigh pros and cons, then decide).

It isn't healthy for you. I wonder if some of the anger and resentment you have for your wife is actually anger and frustration at your own situation. Careful!

It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s responsibility to hold your hand through every step of her bringing you towels after having to figure out how to leave work to do so. She didn\u2019t do anything at all that would justify your statement of not being able to trust her.

I find using the principles CBT most helpful in identifying my emotions, figuring out if their intensity matches the situation, and then deciding on a course of action.

This has all taken a lot of work and practice to get it to work for me. \n\nSo in this situation I\u2019d say that you owe your wife a really big thank you for bringing you the towels despite being at work at the time. You also owe her an apology for your behaviour afterwards, expecting so much of her and stating that you can\u2019t trust her.

Make an appointment with your neurologist or another doctor overseeing your care and ask for recommendations for a brain injury knowledgeable therapist and then start seeing them. You will feel a ton better having more control over how you manage your emotions, your wife will feel much better not having the extra responsibility, and your child will get to see you using healthy coping skills. It\u2019s a win for everyone.", "No one sucks here, this has way more underlying issues that began after the stroke. I had a stroke 17 years ago. I recently had an episode and called an ambulance, spent the night in the ER, etc. Long story short, I think you need to see a therapist and a neurologist. I understand both of your feelings, having a stroke is a major loss of control, your wife, under circumstances not in her control wasn't there for you, you panic.", "YTA. She dropped everything for you and you\u2019re mad because it took longer than instantaneous? Here\u2019s a little fun tip.

You suck so much and your condition is not an excuse. YTA", "The fact that you told your wife that you lost trust in her due to circumstances that she couldn't control makes you an AH.\n\nI can tell that she goes above and beyond to take care of you, the kids, and all of the house work on top of having a job.\n\nYou need to learn how to be more understanding and lenient on her. She does love you very much and you're hurting her when you communicate like she's supposed to drop everything and come to your aid.\n\nThis doesn't mean you can't change. I believe that you should apologize and learn from your mistakes. Be more compassionate and next time you have plans with your children on your own, make sure you bring everything you need ahead of time so your wife doesn't have to do it.\n\nShe deserves a break too sometimes and you should respect that.", "YTA. I understand being stressed in that situation but your wife did everything she could. And let you know it. Plus if 15 minutes of uncertainty stress you out that much maybe you shouldn't be taking the kids out by yourself. At least for a while.\nAnd I notice how much the tone changes at the end of the post. From explaining like a hostile workplace seminar to just sheer anger. That feels more of the tone you've been using towards your wife!", "YTA OP. It was 15 minutes where your wife was not giving you constant updates on her status. I get that you were stressed out, but this is a YOU problem and not her problem to bend over backward to solve. \n\nShe worked so hard to try to help you in your emergency in the middle of her work day. The fact that she was willing to do things like this gives me the impression that she has done a lot for you in the last year with very little thanks. \n\nIt is soooo petty of you to say that you consider her help \"coming with strings\" if the \"strings\" in question is just being appreciative of it. Yes, ALL HELP comes with those strings!! \n\nAlso, it is a gut punch to hear the words from your partner \"can't trust you\". You can't trust your wife because she was out of touch for 15 minutes when she went to go get you the children's towels. That is a really overblown statement for a fairly small issue. She is not even a little bit self-asborbed. You are extremely self-absorbed. She took time out of her work day, even asking a coworker for a favor, to try to solve a problem that you should have been able to solve yourself as an adult. Then, she furthermore made dinner and put the kids down. None of these are the actions of a self-asborbed person.\n\nMeanwhile, you expect her to be thinking from your perspective every single minute. Or else you will criticize her. That must be an enormous weight to bear, on top of raising two kids and helping you with your recovery.", "I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said, but I want to add that acting this way towards your wife shows your children how women are to be treated. I don't know if you have sons or daughters or maybe both, but they are taking notes from dad that wife's are not to be appreciated, and if my wife doesn't jump when I snap my fingers I'm going to speak in a mean way towards her and make her cry and this is ok because I had a stroke.", "Not all men, but somehow always men.", "Wait a minute. You told her that you couldn\u2019t trust her to complete tasks you asked of her? WHEN SHE COMPLETED THOSE TASKS???? She had to leave work, deal with a double parked car, and get towels and instead of just giving up she COMPLETED  the task you gave her. And you have the fucking audacity to tell her you don\u2019t trust her because she didn\u2019t give you a fucking play by play? Seriously? Then she offers to do your chores so you can relax after SHE had the stress of getting the towels to you and you then threw it into her face like that? Yes. Yes YTA and a big one. Man I feel so sorry for her. She went out of her way to help you and you have absolutely no gratitude at all. The entitlement coming off of you is nauseating. \n\nYes, you did have a stroke and are dealing with a lot of crap right now. But guess what, so is your wife. She has to deal with having a completely changed husband who is mean to her. At least she is trying. Why don\u2019t you try to be a little more understanding of where she\u2019s coming from and the effort she\u2019s putting in instead of just resorting to being an insensitive prick.

You are.", "\u201cCan\u2019t be there for me when I have negative emotions.\u201d\n\nSo she is expected to know you are having negative emotions, react exactly the way you want her to react, do exactly what you want her to do no matter what impedes her efforts, or she is not being supportive.  \n\nYour gratitude when expressed and immediately followed by a criticism creates the impression that your gratitude is minor and something you state to just get it out of the way. Then you get to criticize which is really the important part; letting her know how deficient she is so you don\u2019t have to really be grateful for much.\n\nYour negative emotions are your responsibility.  Am noticing that her efforts to help you deal with the consequences of a mistake YOU made (that she had nothing to do with), were not perfect or quick enough, so you are annoyed that training her to be perfect for you is taking an effort and not going well.  Her negative emotions don\u2019t count other than you wanting to justify creating them in her.  \n\nWhen did you decide your wife is totally responsible for everything while you get to let yourself off the hook while what, expecting her to smile and apologize  to you for finding your needs difficult to deal with.", "First of all, I\u2019d like to mention that it is a really good thing that you are sharing this. My impression of you is that you genuinely are interested in learning how and why the communication between you and your wife can go so wrong. To me, it sounds like it\u2019s coming from a place of caring and is an expression of trying to understand what is going on. \n\nUnfortunately, I have to agree with the majority that YTA. \n\nMany have provided detailed descriptions of why this is the case and have also brought up some great suggestions on what you can work on. I hope you have gained some clarity and direction from this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about the stroke. Glad to hear you are doing better. It will take some effort to improve your way of communicating and your (quite rigid) way of perceiving situations, but my impression is that there is hope for you - purely based on your openness, curiosity and willingness to learn. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but think that your way of writing and reaching conclusions really reminds me of Asperger\u2019s syndrome (ASD). One of the core symptoms is that \u2018uncertainty of what is going to happen next\u2019 can create immense anxiety. Perhaps there is a chance that you are on the spectrum without knowing it and that the stroke made the symptoms become more visible. Maybe the symptoms just appear to be very similar to ASD.\n\nI may be wrong, but I thought it was worth mentioning, since perhaps you may benefit from ASD communication training (whether you have ASD or not). Stay curious and implement some changes - I hope the best for you and your family.", "YTA. When you can be trusted to remember to take towels to the pool for your kids, then maybe you can start criticizing her for trying to move heaven and earth at work to fix your fuckup.  Hopefully, you were upset with yourself for making a colossal mistake. Who remembers swimsuits but not towels?", "YTA\n\nThis reminds me of the time my (ex) boyfriend forgot his house keys in the center console of my car.  I was at work and couldn't leave to come home and let him in so he had to come to my office to pick them up.  This man then had the *audacity* to give me attitude for making him come to pick the keys up instead of me dropping everything at work to rush home to let him in the house when *he's* the one who left his keys in the car.\n\nYour post reeks of entitlement.  No, simply saying \"thanks\" when she first offered to bring the towels doesn't suffice when she clearly had to make a lot of effort to actually get those towels to you.  You're a grown ass man, why does your wife need to run around disrupt her workday because *you* forgot towels for your kids?  And then to have the audacity to get mad at her because she wasn't texting you real time updates?  GTFOH.  I'm not sure why you added the part about your stroke and aphasia.  It's unfortunate, but has nothing to do with what happened that day.  \n\nYou owe your wife a major apology.   She's your wife, not your mother.  Next time you forget something, deal with it yourself instead of making her clean up after you and then getting pissed at her when she doesn't do it exactly the way you'd like.", "YTA. Losing trust over someone because of towels is absolutely ridiculous. I know that this new way of life after your stroke can make anxieties and worries and tempers a lot worse because then you feel like you still have to rely on someone so much and you are used to your independence. But I think that criticizing her when she literally did everything she could at the moment and drop work to come bring you the towels was the wrong move. I would ask her why she keeps saying you are mean. Maybe she feels like she has to take on a lot more roles and more things on her shoulders since your stroke and she might be burnt out or have too much going on. When you told her you feel like you can\u2019t trust her that absolutely crushed her. She is doing all of these things for the family and working and she is probably giving 110% to everything and everyone else but 0% into herself or for herself. I would apologize for what you said and that you were stressed out and responded inappropriately at home when trying to talk about it. When it comes to her mentioning gratitude and as childish it may seem/feel next time mention something like hey thank you so much I really appreciate that you stopped what you were doing to help me and continue to do it. When was the last time you two went on a date just the two of you or a weekend away from the kids? Maybe since everything happened it would help to just have alone time and go do something you both enjoy together. If she likes to get her hair or nails done or a massage then book her an appointment on her day off and let her know you wanted to surprise her and let her have some self care and to show you appreciate her.", "Total AH here. I would venture a guess you were like this beforehand too. Her reaction to your request indicates she is traumatized by previous outbursts and she did her best to appease you to avoid another one. \n\nYou could have figured out that situation yourself without having her leave work. \n\nDo better and don't use your illness as a reason to act like an AH to her. She might not stick around for that forever.", "YTA big time! Like genuinely just a mean person, repeat offender ahole!", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry about your condition but to make such a big deal over towels, I\u2019d cry too. You knew it could\u2019ve been solved by asking the front desk but you waited on your wife who was busy working. To say you can\u2019t trust her hurt my feelings for her. Find empathy and patience for those around you and yourself. Stick to saying thank you and be as grateful as possible because I\u2019m sure your wife is hurting knowing you\u2019re not 100% anymore.

Like, if he brings the kids to the theater, is she gonna have to leave work to order the popcorn for him?", "Agreed. She didn't cause OP not to trust her. She let him know she was blocked in and was working to bring him the towels, and said she would be there. And she followed through and did the thing she said she was going to do. OP CHOSE not to trust that she was doing what she said she would do, because she didn't communicate every step of the way.\n\nAnd when she eventually showed up he didn't think \"ok she followed through, I should have trusted her and not worried, that's on me\". He somehow still thought that her actions made her untrustworthy.

I cannot imagine dropping my work day to try to handle a situation for my husband only to be told that I'm not worthy of his trust anymore because I didn't text him constant updates. That's got to hurt so much. She went through so much trouble for him. I would've straight up cried if my husband said that to me. \n\nYTA OP.", "Yes OP, YTA. I am in awe at the absolute projection in the end where you call your wife self-absorbed. It's almost hilarious but mostly really sad.", "Yeah, reading the post and the way he phrases things makes me thing the stroke may have affected him worse than he thought. It's possible he's stating a lot of things which to him are \"logical\" but to outside parties are tactless. I don't know if that's a thing but I know my friend had brain damage in a bike crash and spoke exclusively in monotone without any inflection even when saying things like \"thanks, you're the best!\". I believe this could definitely be a factor here. That said it doesn't excuse this unusual chain of events. He was waiting for a little over 15 mins and asked his wife to leave work to get towels he forgot. So many off ramps for this situation.", "OP, this and I am concerned for you. The lack of self-awareness that led you to even have to ask here means you are not grasping basic interactions. Your wife DID help you, she DID communicate with you about the car being blocked and what she was doing to mitigate it, and she DID get to you within 15 minutes. The rest of us here are wondering what else she could have done because anything beyond that would be excessive or require her to text while driving. \n\nAnd on top of that, she did help you  that evening with the kids. There were no strings attached. That is something you are contriving. \n\nYou need additional help here. Gentle YTA because I think your injury is causing more issues than you realize.", "YTA You thanked her in a 2 word text but had a full conversation about your disappointment with her.

She stopped everything she was doing at work to leave to bring you towels that *YOU FORGOT* and then had to deal with someone double parking and blocking her in. She also tried to get coworkers to help. Yet somehow you think that she is the AH. You lack self awareness and you are the self absorbed one. Stop using your stroke as an excuse to be a jerk, especially to your partner.

It seems he is suffering a lot more problems than just aphasia. Inability to self gauge, emotional dysregulation, overwhelm and anxiety, loss of empathy, forgetfulness, etc. Brain injuries often effect multiple areas of the brain. But even if the injury was hyper localized we are finding that each part of the brain does a lot more than originally theorized. You often don\u2019t see deficits that you have and when you do see the deficits, you have you think they are much better than they are. \nSource I\u2019m a neuroscientist who then sustained a moderate traumatic brain injury and had to go through 8 months of cognitive rehabilitation. And yes it was very surreal being on the other side. I thought I was just a little forgetful after the injury, but turns out I had issues in long term and working memory, hearing loss, vision issues, fine motor deficits, attention and focus deficits, I was a fall risk, etc. I rebuilt it all over the course of 8 months to a year and now I\u2019m back to where I was before the accident except for my attention and focus issues. But it took a very long time and a lot of intense work. \nTo me it sounds like OP needs more healing and he is probably in denial or just can\u2019t remember all of the issues he is facing (this is actually very common). It can take years before someone is done with their healing process. If he can or hasn\u2019t gone through cognitive rehabilitation he needs to. And therapy is a part of that along with speech therapy, occupational therapy, vision therapy, and physical therapy.

I know it sounds like a very fine hair being split here, but to him the problem could seem bigger and of greater importance than it might be otherwise.  This then leads me to think that communication needs to be a bit more detailed, at least until they learn how to get past his injury incident.  She needs to tell him how what he says is coming across to her, and he needs to be be clear to her why he wants her to text him more often.

All of this conspired to badly exacerbate existing anxiety and ADHD that resulted in him being an emotional live wire who was constantly constantly constantly lashing out. He had a tendency to project his anxiety outward before, but it wasn\u2019t constant and it didn\u2019t bother me that much. Then it\u2019s like it started and just never stopped. It was really bad and even though he\u2019s made huge strides, I\u2019m still pretty traumatized by it. To the point where like a grumpy little snide comment will make me cry.

As much as OP thought his wife took care of the kids - a kind gesture - because she was trying to manipulate *him*, this type of behavior says \"you can't get upset at my attack because I've disguised it as communicating my feelings\". It's the attack and setup for the RVO of DARVO, because the attacker will meet any response beyond coddling as an attack on *them*. It's so textbook you can practically hear the \"Oh so I'm just not allowed to tell you how I feel.\" that's on deck ready to go to frame the abused as the controlling, aggressive one.\n\nI'm not sure how much OP's behavior has changed or how much of this is due to the stroke, but there are too many abusive behaviors here to overlook. Abusive people rarely know (or face) that they're abusive. It's pathological and they don't necessarily see it. One common trait among most abusive people is assigning their negative emotions to their partner, then attacking them as if they're the source despite those emotions being there before their partner or regardless of their actions. This is why it becomes an escalating, impossible, goal-post-moving endeavor to avoid abuse. The abuser is trying to solve inner turmoil by projecting it instead of working on the actual source - *themselves*. It works as well as trying to fix a car engine by changing the tires, then the headlights, then the muffler, and on and on. \n\nYou see this behavior in OP when he assigned his fear and anxiety to his wife's actions *before she completed them*, saw her effort to make it up to him as manipulation, and when he berated her with \"his feelings\". If he doesn't get to the root of this, he will see every good deed or effort she puts in as a trick or a failure, will require endless hoop-jumping for zero payoff, and will destroy his marriage and his wife as a person.

Not using a towel.\n\nI would do any of these things before I would consider calling to interrupt someone at work and abruptly tell them to come fix a mistake I made. I especially wouldn't do something so entitled to a person I'm supposed to care about.\n\nAnd then the audacity to say \"It's fine that I was nothing but critical and ungrateful towards her after she did what I told her to do because I totally texted her 'thank you' one time when I first made my demanding request.\"\n\nMaybe there was a time when OP's wife wouldn't leave work for this either, but I can only imagine how badly he's been treating her when she refuses to drop everything to be at his beck and call over a trivial issue like this. She's probably so worn down by now that she just immediately complies with his inconsiderate requests in the hopes that OP won't go out of his way to make the rest of her week/month/life miserable.", "Well, OP said when he didn't hear from her for 15 minutes he considered asking the front desk for towels, so I assume that was a solution all along.", "He said he knew he didn\u2019t have towels before he got to the pool. The easier solution would be for him to just turn around and get towels? I don\u2019t understand why that wasn\u2019t a thing", "While OP is going on about how he can\u2019t trust his wife to bring him towels in a timely manner, she\u2019s probably sitting there wondering if she can trust him to take their kids out by himself again. If he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to work through this low stakes of a problem by himself, I would be absolutely terrified about how he might try to work through an actual emergency situation, especially if his wife isn\u2019t able to drop what she\u2019s doing & get to their location.", "For your sake, I hope you can dial it back and stop being Wife Of The Year. If he's going to criticize you anyway, might as well say \"no, work it out yourself\" the next time he calls demanding towels, and focus on your career. You may need the safety net. :(", "This point was being missed, since it was swim \u201cclass\u201d there probably was a set start time. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave my young kids at the pool alone. But yeah, front desk or else I have an old scratchy blanket in the car for emergencies, sorry kids you gotta dry off with this just this one time.", "So executive dysfunction doesn\u2019t take away your ability to come up with solutions or lack logic. Example: You know to feel happy you need to clean your bedroom, You really want to clean your bedroom. All you can think about is cleaning your bedroom. You can imagine in your head how you\u2019re going to clean the bedroom. But no matter how much you scream at yourself, you just can\u2019t manage to even start cleaning the bedroom", "When my wife is having aphasia symptoms from her migraines, sometimes she'll get around it by grabbing a related object and talking about \"its friend.\" So if she can't access the word \"remote,\" she'll ask about the TV's friend.\n\nIt's such a cute workaround for what seems like a very frustrating side effect", "YTA- maybe have a \u2018swim\u2019 bag that is packed the night before or keep extra towels and sunblock in the car. My kids (5, 6 and 11y) each have a separate bag for swim/soccer/dance in the laundry room. The bags are \u2018restocked\u2019 as we do the wash and the kids are responsible for making sure they have what they need before we get in the car. It definitely helps cut out wasting time looking for items the morning of or rushing to pack it up during a busy morning. \n\nDepending on the ages of the kids they should be responsible for getting their own gear ready and in the car.", "Not only let her leave but found towels for her so she wouldn't have to go home and get them. And he mad cuz she didnt text him for 15 min", "The fact that his wife left work immediately rather than texting him an eyeroll emoji tells me that she's still in caretaker mode. I had a period where I was caring for a really ill family member and it's hard to just snap out of it overnight. The wife is processing every request of her husband's as \"this is an emergency that I need to take care of for him\" rather than \"he's a grown adult who can solve his own small problem\" probably because she still views him as in recovery from a serious medical incident (which he is). When your family member has an emergency this serious you leave work, with or without permission.\n\nHowever it sounds like the emergency stage is well past. The wife needs to set up boundaries and stop dropping everything for non-urgent concerns of her husband. Otherwise like others I worry her job might be in jeopardy not to mention her mental health. She must be stressed the hell out working and remotely supervising her husband simultaneously. Hopefully OP can come to understand how much she's sacrificing for him. And hopefully OP is getting appropriate therapy for to help with the recovery of his cognitive and communication skills.", "Lots of jobs allow stuff like this.  I think (unfortunately) too many people are just used to being stuck in suffocating jobs.\n\nWhen my people come to me and say, \"Hey boss, I need to run go take care of an errand, I'll [Work late, come in early, take PTO, use PTB] to make it up.\"  \n\nI just ask, \"Is everything OK?  Something I can help with?\" and as long as everything is fine I just hit em with the, \"Alright, take care, see you around.\"", "Sounds like OP's wife didn't trust him to solve the situation himself, so she actually leaves her work to bring over some towels. She probably is used to carrying her whole household as she feels she can't trust OP to take the kids to the pool by himself, as this likely is one out of multiple incidents.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute and then imagine OP asking his wife to sit down to talk, to tell her he can't trust her with these kind of mundane tasks... \n\nComes in here to write about today's events - 'AITA?' lol", "I mean if I didn't trust my husband to do basic tasks I also wouldn't trust him driving my children in a moving vehicle or watching them in a swimming pool.", "~~double tildes on each side of the striken text~~\n\nThese ~\n\nAlso no spaces between the text and the tildes", "THANK YOU!!
