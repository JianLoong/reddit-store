I had a stroke last year, which was stressful, but I am doing well. I had aphasia as a side effect. I pass as normal to most people. Since the stroke our communication is worse. Sometimes when I talk to her, she says I'm mean, and she cries and I have no idea why. I don\u2019t know if I'm misspeaking, or she's sensitive, or if something I say is actually mean. This didn\u2019t happen much before the stroke, but it happens a lot now. I try to be nice when we talk. \n\nToday, I took my kids to swim class. I got there and realized I had forgotten towels. I texted my wife, and she offered to go home and get towels and bring them to me. I replied thanking her.\n\nI got the kids in the pool, and called her. She was still at work, and said her car was blocked in and she was finding the person who blocked her in. Her coworkers were getting her towels and she would come to the pool when she could. I didn't hear from her for 15 minutes. I considered asking the front desk for towels, or sun-drying the kids, but I was just stuck because I didn't know if my wife was coming. I know some people would handle the uncertainty better, but it stressed me out. She showed up with the towels, we talked, and she left. I didn't say much because I was feeling upset and am very careful if I'm upset and talking to my wife.\n\nWhen she got home, she offered to finish dinner and put down the kids, since she knew I had been with them all afternoon. I said sure, since I still had some work left. I asked if it was ok to talk, and she said ok. I told her I feel like I can't trust her when I ask her to do something because she won\u2019t update me if there are unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI was careful to say I wasn\u2019t criticizing her, just sharing how I felt. I could tell she was upset. I asked her if she understood me, and she repeated it back to me. It sounded like she understood.\n\nI asked her if I said something mean. She said that she didn\u2019t blame me, but that it hurt her feelings that I would complain to her without thanking her or thinking about how hard she worked to get me the towels. I told her that I DID thank her, I immediately texted \u201cthank you\u201d when she said she would come. She also said something sarcastic like \u201cand you\u2019re welcome for coming home and offering to take the kids!\u201d\n\nWhat does my gratitude have to do with not trusting her? I appreciate everything she does for me. The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings. If she does that for me, then I can only feel gratitude. So I told her not to bother. I also said something like \"don't do me any favors\", which I guess is not the nicest choice of words.\n\nI think she\u2019s the AH because she is self absorbed, and can\u2019t be there for me when I have negative emotions. I think I might be the AH because she\u2019s upset and I know she tries to give me the benefit of the doubt, and if so I'm hoping reddit can explain it to me.", "created_utc": 1680009244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124oddw/aita_telling_my_wife_i_cant_trust_her_after_she/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't hear from her for 15 minutes and freaked out? That's a you problem. Learn to handle stress better. Get help if you have to. Why wouldn't you feel gratitude if she does something for you? You seem ungrateful in this post. She didn't do anything wrong, but you said you don't trust her? I truly think you could benefit from therapy. I feel bad for your wife. You sound draining for her to deal with.", "INFO: Since you've acknowledged asking the front desk for towels was an option why did you contact your wife who was at work?", "Alright so hate to break it to you but YTA. \n\nTo me It sounds like she was trying to be incredibly supportive and helpful and you basically emotionally punished her for it. \n\nIt was 15 minutes that you didn\u2019t hear from her. That\u2019s not very long and more than likely she was busy trying to fix the situation of being blocked in etc. the more she stops to update you the longer it takes to fix the situation.

You then chased her twice as she tried to rectify your error, and when you got home berated her for what? Not calling you within 15 minutes? It\u2019s towels, not life-threatening medication. \n\nYour stroke has nothing to do with this.

That\u2019s absurd.", "You thanked her once, when she first agreed. You did not thank her at all for ALL of the work she had to put in to getting you those towels, tho. She had a coworker get the towels (coworker deserves a thank you, too.) She had to chase down whoever blocked her car in, she had to likely finish up some work stuff before being able to leave etc. \n\nAnd you're mad she didn't stop IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT HECTIC STUFF to message you WHY she was taking so long. \n\nHave patience, and trust she is trying her best. \n\nThen she knows it was stressful for *you* so she offers to take over kid duty that evening. Instead of just being thankful, you also had to admonish her way of handling your request. \n\nYou forgot the towels, not her. She was at WORK.

It sounds like you created a stressful situation for yourself and then you not only dragged her into it, you found a way to blame her for the way you felt/acted. Bringing the kids AND their towels to swim class was your responsibility. But instead, she had to leave work (presumably early or in the middle of her day) to deal with the situation that you created. \n\nNot having towels at swim class is hardly an emergency situation - you two did not need to be in constant communication about it. And TBH, it was something you could have dealt with on your own. You could have asked the front desk for towels or asked another parent if they could share/had extras. Depending on the age of your kids, you could have even gone home to get the towels while they had their lesson. \n\nYou need therapy to learn how to deal with your negative emotions without dumping them or blaming them on your partner. The fact that you frequently make her cry now MAY be due to your medical issues. The fact that you occasionally made her cry BEFORE your stroke is something else entirely.", "Uhm \n\nUh\n\nYTA\n\nYou asked for towels and your wife bought them. She was at work at the time and was blocked in for 15 extra minutes. \n\n15 minutes is not a long time OP.\n\nSeems like you and your wife have lost your means of communication.

Go see a counselor for heaven's sake.", "YTA\n\nYour wife did you numerous favors to make up for *your* mistake and instead of being appreciative, you declared her \"untrustworthy.\" (And at any point did you apologize for forgetting the towels and inconveniencing your wife?) She went above and beyond, only to get criticized for failing to meet your standards.\n\nLook, when's the last time you worked with a therapist or talked to your neurologist? Because it sounds like the stroke impacted your ability to empathize and see things from other people's perspective. That's a really bad weak spot when it comes to marriage and co-parenting. Biting your tongue to prevent yourself from accidentally sounding \"mean\" clearly isn't enough. If you don't learn how to work around your emotional blindspots, your marriage is doomed.", "YTA you forgot the towels and she went out of her way while SHE WAS AT WORK. Who is self-absorbed?", "YTA\n\nYou forgot the towels. Wife, while at work, took off and struggled to get out to get the towels you forgot to bring and you got upset she was a bit late despite explaining why.\n\nI'm very certain she was with you while recovering from your stroke (which I'm sorry you suffered through), and did her utmost to help you there. Yet here you are accusing her of being self absorbed.\n\n...Almost forgot, this is about *friggin' towels.* The worst that would happen is your car seats would have been a bit wet.

Has anyone suggested that when you get upset you stop and analyze why and try to critically think the situation through without trying to assess blame first? If not, then you should start doing so.  \n\nFurther to tell your spouse you cannot trust them over a delay on bringing towels to a pool while they are at work, which you forgot, is the height of asinine behavior.", "YTA.

Think ab how much your wife had to put up with you without you hearing on ounce of criticism. I\u2019m sure she was there during your recovery, made extreme sacrifices, and as stated she has sat through you making her feel like shit, etc. you lose trust her in just for forgetting towels when in reality, she was trying her hardest to bring you towels and outside factors stopped it. It sounds like you need to reevaluate your reactions", "YTA. You can\u2019t trust her because she didn\u2019t update you on the towel situation as she was trying to find someone who blocked her in?

Before or after you decided to treat her like a damned child?", "YTA.  Please consider that your behavior/tone of voice may have changed considerably since your stroke.  You may not be fully aware of this.  Your wife is probably not able to verbalize what has changed very well and you may both need counseling to get through this.  \n\nUnfortunately, I know two people who have had serious strokes that left them very changed.  One has completely lost his mental filter and basically can't go out in public alone because he's constantly saying things that would get him arrested if there isn't someone there to explain.

So YTA.\n\nWhile you are the one struggling with the aphasia and other long-term effects of your stroke, it affects her too.

She was literally doing her best to get you the towels, and you freaked out after 15 minutes.

Never mind that she\u2019s at WORK and trying to fix YOUR mistake. \n\nLook, I think you should talk to your doctor. Strokes can cause major anxiety post-recovery and it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re struggling with an emotional issue and taking it out on your wife.

I had a stroke last year, which was stressful, but I am doing well. I had aphasia as a side effect. I pass as normal to most people. Since the stroke our communication is worse. Sometimes when I talk to her, she says I'm mean, and she cries and I have no idea why. I don\u2019t know if I'm misspeaking, or she's sensitive, or if something I say is actually mean. This didn\u2019t happen much before the stroke, but it happens a lot now. I try to be nice when we talk. \n\nToday, I took my kids to swim class. I got there and realized I had forgotten towels. I texted my wife, and she offered to go home and get towels and bring them to me. I replied thanking her.\n\nI got the kids in the pool, and called her. She was still at work, and said her car was blocked in and she was finding the person who blocked her in. Her coworkers were getting her towels and she would come to the pool when she could. I didn't hear from her for 15 minutes. I considered asking the front desk for towels, or sun-drying the kids, but I was just stuck because I didn't know if my wife was coming. I know some people would handle the uncertainty better, but it stressed me out. She showed up with the towels, we talked, and she left. I didn't say much because I was feeling upset and am very careful if I'm upset and talking to my wife.\n\nWhen she got home, she offered to finish dinner and put down the kids, since she knew I had been with them all afternoon. I said sure, since I still had some work left. I asked if it was ok to talk, and she said ok. I told her I feel like I can't trust her when I ask her to do something because she won\u2019t update me if there are unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI was careful to say I wasn\u2019t criticizing her, just sharing how I felt. I could tell she was upset. I asked her if she understood me, and she repeated it back to me. It sounded like she understood.\n\nI asked her if I said something mean. She said that she didn\u2019t blame me, but that it hurt her feelings that I would complain to her without thanking her or thinking about how hard she worked to get me the towels. I told her that I DID thank her, I immediately texted \u201cthank you\u201d when she said she would come. She also said something sarcastic like \u201cand you\u2019re welcome for coming home and offering to take the kids!\u201d\n\nWhat does my gratitude have to do with not trusting her? I appreciate everything she does for me. The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings. If she does that for me, then I can only feel gratitude. So I told her not to bother. I also said something like \"don't do me any favors\", which I guess is not the nicest choice of words.\n\nI think she\u2019s the AH because she is self absorbed, and can\u2019t be there for me when I have negative emotions. I think I might be the AH because she\u2019s upset and I know she tries to give me the benefit of the doubt, and if so I'm hoping reddit can explain it to me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Similar to you, he had a hard time understanding subtext and emotional implications and when I would be talking to him after the stroke and crying he would just change the subject or not understand what was needed from him. This has gotten better over the years but we still occasionally have to discuss behavior that is different now than before. He was in an all day rehab program for a month which helped significantly (we called it daddy daycare lol). It didn't solve all his problems but helped with the biggest ones. We also did couples therapy a few months after which was helpful in helping each of us to understand where the other was coming from. Communication became even more important and if I was upset I had to specifically say something. He had to work on not getting defensive and either pointing out why he didn't feel I was right or accepting what I was saying had merit. Strokes are so incredibly difficult and I really encourage you to seek out all the resources you can for yourself. He's now developing symptoms similar to ADHD but can't take ADHD meds (which have shown to be beneficial to people with TBIs) because of his BP but if it's an option for you consider that too.", "You\u2019re calling your wife self absorbed? Kettle calling the pot black much?", "YTA\n\nI have great sympathy for you having to live with the effects of your stroke.  But I'm going to be blunt. You are asking your wife to compensate for you, and it's not appropriate if you want to have a healthy marriage. \n\nShe's been crying a lot.  Probably because it isn't that you're saying awful things to her, and this is the only problem. But she has the added responsibility of taking care of YOU too, now, and she's burning out.\n\nIf my husband was is the same position, as you were, and he text me that he'd forgotten towels, my answer would be \"So figure something out.\"\n\nTowels are not such an emergency that I would leave work to bring them to you, because you could just get some from the desk. Or the kids sun dry.  It was not an important situation that requires her involvement.\n\nThat you say you can't trust her now?  Dude. I was YOUR judgement of the situation that was flawed.  Grown ups just SOLVE little problems like this, by themselves.\n\nAnd I expect this is how you have been living your life, and that's why she's crying.  You have become ultra dependent upon her, and your judgement of situations, and what her involvement should be, is definitely screwed up.\n\nSo reach out for appropriate therapy to create a new environment in which you are more independent, encourages making good judgements, and reduces the weight of responsibility for her.\n\nI get that you have a problem you cannot help. You must learn how to compensate YOURSELF.", "Not quite the same perhaps but my husband suffered from a traumatic brain injury a few years ago as a result of a fall.

It\u2019s hard to explain and those that don\u2019t know him well before and after may not even notice. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is that he is a bit more \u201cclingy\u201d and he is more impatient. He wants things done as he thinks of them or is doing them and if he needs my assistance it sort has to be then and there. I\u2019m not sure that he\u2019s cognizant of it himself and explaining it to him is difficult. \n\nWe talk about it from time to time so he has some realization of it and can process it a bit to correct himself in these instances. \n\nIs this behavior that would have been typical of you pre-stroke?  If not, then you may need to consider that you have some after effects of the stroke that should be dealt with. Perhaps talking to a doctor or therapist could help. \n\nIt sounds like your wife acted in a very normal and rational way and for you to NOT trust her now seems to be an overreaction.

You need to ask your doctor if this mental stress, impatience, and lack of empathy is an expected side effect of your stroke recovery. Then, you need to contact a therapist who can help you manage this stress while you hopefully continue to heal. I have sympathy for your situation. Based on your wife's reactions that you described early in the post, it sounds like you may be behaving in a way that she finds unexpected. Personality changes after traumatic brain issues are very common, as I understand. You understand this, I'm sure, but you really need to take stock of the fact that you might be acting very differently than you did before, and that it may upset people. If you can establish that this is a medical condition, you and your wife will have a foundation to work from. The situation you described does not warrant the emotions and reaction you had. She dropped everything to help you, 15 minutes is not a long time if she's dealing with extenuating circumstances, and she is not obligated to update you every 5 minutes in order to support you when you \"have negative emotions.\" Handling your negative emotions is YOUR job.\n\n>The offer to do my chores is very nice, but I guess it came with strings.

Okay, have you done anything to make sure that never happens again? You need to make a \"take kids swimming\" checklist. If you find yourself needing help getting stuff like that done correctly, you need to make lots of checklists, shopping lists, to-do lists, calendars, etc.\n\nYou upset your wife. What could you have done differently? You could have thanked her for dropping everything to bail you out. Make a checklist: before bringing up new topic, is there anything you should be thanking your wife for? And speaking of new topics, instead of telling her how you felt (and honestly, do women really want to hear about men's feelings? They may say they do, but in my experience: for most women, only if they're romantic feelings) ask her advice. She said she'd bring towels. She'll probably say \"if I say I'm going to do something I will, stop expecting blow-by-blow texts.\" Take that onboard. You need to deal with your own anxiety, not offload it onto her.\n\nThink \"Memento\". That guy had serious brain damage, and he developed ways to compensate. You need to be like that.

Give more love, and less criticism.", "You seem super entitled to your wife\u2019s time and by this story I cannot imagine that if the roles were reversed that you would accept being at your wife\u2019s beck and call so thanklessly.

People leave their partners all the time when the other one gets sick (luckily for you, men are much more likely to do it). But it seems like you\u2019re gonna blow up over something as stupid as not getting a text in 15 MINUTES, after your wife dropped everything to get you some towels, your marriage is not gonna last when your condition worsens.

It does not seem necesary or grateful to tell her you can't trust her because you had at least 2 other options to solve your problem in case she was not there. You texted your wife at work becuse you forgot towels so she could solve your issue which seems a little unnecessary.  She followed through on what she said she would do pretty quickly and was very considerate of you by finishing dinner and taking over with the kids when she got home. Nothing you describe makes her seem untrustworthy, self absorbed or an AH.\n\nIf you find it too stressful to ask your wife to do favors when you can't see her or get constant updates then just don't.

Your wife is trying to be supportive but you keep kicking her in the teeth with your complaints that she\u2019s not good enough.

YTA", "YTA but this is something you and your wife need to talk about in therapy. Not communicating for fifteen minutes, presumably when she's driving over, is unfair to her, especially when she told you very quickly what the hold -ups were.\n\nMy dad had a traumatic brain injury a few months ago and is recovering with aphasia right now. It definitely hurts communication. It's not just the word mix-ups, it's the fact that he'll say something, we'll misunderstand because the wrong words came out, and everyone feels like they communicated perfectly when in reality, we were having two different conversations entirely. Yesterday, he asked if I put his card back in his wallet. An hour later, I realized he was actually asking if I put his leftovers in the fridge. I understand that a stroke and aphasia lead to difficulties that you likely never had to worry about before.\n\nHowever, this isn't a communication issue. At least, not that you've described. This isn't her making assumptions about what you mean, or not listening to you, or unfairly coddling you. You asked for a favor, she did the favor. I really don't see why you felt so poorly about her afterward. If you actually don't trust her, after she drops work and brings you towels and is only MIA for fifteen minutes, then you need to address that head on and not blame her when she hasn't done anything wrong.", "YTA for sure. Sounded like wife was doing her best to get the towels to you asap, that you forgot, and in trying to hurry, didn't think to stop and update you at every step.

Maybe next time, just let me know and I'll go to the front desk and ask for a couple so you don't have to go through all of that.\" Then NTA, but this wasn't the case.", "YTA. It\u2019s funny you would try and call her self absorbed, when she went to a lot of effort to leave work and do you a favor. It sounds like her running behind was out of her control, and had she stopped to text you a play by play, it would have just taken even longer. Idk if you being so selfish is a result of your stroke, but you should probably find a way to stop being so critical and negative or you\u2019ll just end up divorced when your wife decides she\u2019s done being talked down to.", "You forgot the towels and your wife dropped everything to bring them to you.\n\nShe got blocked in and was trying to find the person to set her free, whilst arranging for her coworkers to find towels to replace the ones that you forgot.\n\nYou then told her you didn't trust her be because she didn't update you, while she was trying to find a solution to a problem you created, when she was supposed to be at work\n\nYou shouldn't even have bothered her and just borrowed towels from the gym.\n\nI hope that explains why YTA in this situation.", "Your wife left work, went home, and brought you towels because you packed irresponsibly.

He can barely talk at this point.  And yes having the stroke, and likly his inability to communicate with us, can give him a short fuse which is super weird because he was the biggest sweetheart teddy bear of a guy before hand.  And most of the time still is.  But you know what?  That\u2019s not what happened to you.  You admit that you said mean things to your wife before the stroke.  Then you took out your frustration about your mess up on your wife after she fixed your problem.  It doesn\u2019t matter what words you used to talk to her about it, the fact that you were trying to tell her that you can\u2019t trust (or rely on as some people are thinking this is a word mix up but frankly it doesn\u2019t matter) her because she took a whole 15 min to fix your mistake is you being a jerk and making your F**k ups her problem.  You clearly communicated what you wanted to communicate.  And what you wanted to communicate make you the AH.  Also stop using the aphasia as an excuse for being a jerk to your wife when you say you can pass as normal to most poeple.  If you can pass as normal that means you aren\u2019t communicating that badly, which means if you are mean to your wife that\u2019s because you are a mean person.  Get therapy.

And apparently all that effort wasn\u2019t good enough and she did it wrong?? Enough to complain about, and not only that, but say she isn\u2019t trustworthy? I mean it comes off like you think your shit is pure gold. And her dinner and devotion are pure shit. Please get both therapy and some occupational medicine help to deal with your impressive (now unfiltered) male entitlement and whatever effects the stroke is having on you.", "**If this story is how you treat your wife all the time, you are abusive.**\n\nYour wife in this story went above and beyond to fix a problem **you** created by forgetting the towels, only to be met with criticism because you had to wait for 15 minutes without constant communication. In fact, you went so far as so say that because you had to wait and it stressed you out, that you can't trust her to help you. You made your problem her problem, and blamed her for not fixing it.\n\nYou and your wife need to schedule an appointment with your neurologist to see if these personality changes are permanent, or if this is something that can be resolved.

It could be due to the stroke but that doesn\u2019t make you less of an AH it\u2019s just a reason. Reasons are not excuses. You were quite ungrateful and horrible, and thanking someone in advance is not the same as thanking them after they do something for you, never mind that your request became more difficult (her being boxed in) and taking more time and effort for her to do than initially though.\n\nYou are showing 0 appreciation and frankly you need to work harder on it. If this is a typical day for you and how you handle interactions with your wife, there is no reason for her to stick around. So do better. Work on it. When she tells you you are being mean, note what you said and how you said it, use it as an example of what not to say in future. \n\nHeck if you need more time to process then say that and then have a think about how you want to respond.\nRight now you\u2019ve provided an example of your negative emotions from a situation you caused being justification for you blaming your wife for it.

It's clear her mental state has nothing to do with his medical condition and evrything to do with how he's doubled down on controlling and antagonizing behavior since his stroke.\n\nI'll also point out that this kind of abusive behavior is very sophisticated and takes some foresight and planning so it's ridiculous that OP is trying to pass this all off as if it's a result of brain damage.", "Not just complaining but telling her he *could no longer trust her* after she scrambled to fix his mistake as quick as she could.", "Here's \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 for putting it so well\n\nYTA OP", "I feel like this has to be the stroke, right?

He is clearly doing his best to try to work around his new way of thinking and deal with the emotions from that without hurting his wife and she seems to be doing her best to handle things as well but struggling with how he handles things now. I think if they could find a couples therapist with an interest in neurology, they might be able to work out a new way to communicate that works well for both of them, but they have to understand exactly what is going on in his brain now and what deficits in thinking that creates, the same way I've had to figure out how to accommodate the deficits created by ADHD.", "I\u2019m sad for her.

You seem to be having difficulty with a basic concept of marriage. Trust... a therapist may be helpful and they have magics wait lists in most places still. I would recommend talking to one for yourself and maybe even one for the two of you together.", "OP, you sound like you've lost some sense of empathy. Your behaviors and responses demonstrate a lack of empathy. It's not far fetched that you need to consider that your stroke impacted your prefrontal cortex or other related areas that are in control of emotions, memories, etc. You yourself are stating you can't be trusted to remember simple things. If your memory is impacted, so are all the other related areas. \n\nWhile counseling for you two is a good idea, you need to make an appointment with your doctor, explain these symptoms you are experiencing, and request an MRI to see if this is either lasting damage or something that will return over time. \n\nYou also need to have a frank conversation with your wife about this as this isn't an \"asshole\" situation as much as a traumatic brain injury situation. She DESERVES to know that your behavior is physiological more than psychological. \n\nWith that said, that doesn't excuse you from not trying to exercise emotions and empathy, nor does it allow you to make it an excuse for how you act or what you say. So don't do that. This isn't your fault, but it is your responsibility. Don't attempt to put the burden of understanding on her when you act in callous and non-empathetic ways. Also, don't sweep this under the rug. Once you have a stroke, especially at your age, you are at increased risk for other strokes as well as \"mini-strokes\". Behavior changes, however slight they may appear, need to be reported to your neurologist and needs to be investigated. Don't let someone hand wave you off and say \"well, let's see if it gets better first\". That's a great way to miss something and get something that could have been temporary become permanent. Get a damn MRI at the very least.", "Well then if it wasn't harsh I don't understand why it's a big deal you needed to tell your wife.

But you can't be trusted to do the job right in the first place that put her in a situation where she had to leave work.\n\nWhy be frustrated at her for something you're way more incompetent at. That's like someone who can't read or write complaining that their wife misspelled a word.\n\nAlso take a step back, telling someone you can't trust them is a very harsh thing in general. Trust is a integral part of a relationship, to tell your spouse you can't *trust* them?! The person you've been physically, financially, emotionally vulnerable with and planned to live with your entire life, you can't trust them. Just bc you didn't get a omw while they were scrambling to get to you for a non emergency. It's like you expected her to move the heavens and the earth and let you know exactly when she was doing each at each precise moment\n\nAs someone who suffers from anxiety, is impatient etc, I used to get really panicky anytime my partner left the house. Id be calculating the exact time it takes to get to a particular store, the eta of the shopping and time it gets back to come home and then a cushion for traffic and I would always freak out if a 10 minute trip turned into 30 minutes. Id question him up and down, not bc I thought he was cheating but my mind was like how can it possibly take X amount of time to do Y. Then I learned I was the problem, I had the problem.

This may be an executive function issue from your stroke. And the way the uncertainty while waiting upset i think is secondary to you\u2019re adapting to an EF impairment. Like you are constantly questioning because you lack confidence in your own judgment, which is extremely stressful, and that kind of ongoing stress is going to make anyone more temperamental. \n\nYou need to relearn some problem solving skills (stop, consider options, weigh pros and cons, then decide).

It isn't healthy for you. I wonder if some of the anger and resentment you have for your wife is actually anger and frustration at your own situation. Careful!

Saying she\u2019s untrustworthy IS hurtful.\n\nBut also, learn to sit with your own stress and anxiety. It is no one else\u2019s responsibility to manage it. Would it have been nice if your wife had texted? Sure. But it was 15 minutes. You really hurt your wife over 15 minutes of not knowing where your towels were coming from. Totally not worth all the fuss kicked up and totally not worth hurting your wife.", "Life is uncertain, you should know that better than anyone. But at the end of the day, you have your life, and you got your towels. Why are you making it about the one negative? You have a wife who stayed with you after your stroke, look up the rates of husbands leaving wives after a chronic or terminal health diagnosis. She stayed, stepped up, and continues to step up even as you call her \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d for not texting you enough *while she was stepping up, again.* For fucking shame, dude.", "Do you realize what it means to tell your wife \u201cI can\u2019t trust you\u201d? It is a huge sentence, it has huge ramifications, that means that you are disappointed in her, in your relationship, and you don\u2019t believe that you have her support.\n\nIt is an incredibly mean thing to say to your partner.", "It has everything to do with the post. Telling her you can\u2019t trust her is the same as telling her she disappointed you.

Telling your partner, the mother to your children that you can\u2019t trust her after she did everything in her power to help as soon as possible? That\u2019s a HUGE deal, and exceedingly selfish and short-sighted. \n\nNo wonder she\u2019s so hurt, because your behavior based on what you\u2019ve described is very hurtful. She dropped everything at work to try to help you, and because she wasn\u2019t updating you every moment of the ordeal you tell her your trust in her is broken. That\u2019s just beyond fucked up.", "Sounds like you need to make a point of voicing more appreciation to your wife. If you truly think she's amazing, tell her. Show her through your actions. Make sure she knows you think of her that way. Because right now, it kind of sounds like you're assuming she knows you feel that way without you doing much to show it.\n\nNegative interactions stick around a lot longer than positive ones do. On that note, just because you have a negative feeling doesn't mean you have to share it. Feelings are not logical, nor are they the responsibility of other people. I deal with anxiety and depression, and it can make me very irritable, so I make sure to let the people I love know that I'm just very cranky at that moment and that they aren't doing anything wrong. I also make sure to sincerely apologize if my reactions are rude, because they can be and it isn't THEIR fault, it's MY fault. If you're upset that she didn't update you when you didn't let her know that updates were an expectation, that is a YOU problem.

You say you don\u2019t think she did anything wrong but then turned around and told her she doesn\u2019t update you enough when it comes to helping you. That\u2019s literally TELLING HER she did something WRONG. I think you need to relearn how to understand that people do not take words at face value all the time - some things are inferred based on the way you say things. YTA in this situation. I\u2019d leave someone if they told me they couldn\u2019t trust me, especially if it was over something as simple as bringing towels.", "She didn't create uncertainty, you did. She said she'd bring them and she did. Only 15 mins went by, what did you expect her to do?? Call every 2 mins and let you know what was going on. Sounds like you have some issues, not her. Sounds like you have confidence issues and trust issues that need worked out.", "YTA. You do realize at least two of your rebuttals are completely contradicting to your own explanation of the events?

Just to reiterate YTA", "You say you\u2019ve never chastised her or told her she disappointed you for not meeting your unspoken and, frankly, unreasonable goals, but that\u2019s a bold faced lie. Your entire post is about you doing exactly that. You need to work with a therapist to figure out how to cope better with your emotional self, because you are unreasonable and emotionally abusive to your wife. Your replies are all very defensive as well, you clearly came here expecting to be comforted, but the reality is you\u2019re a giant AH who expects to allowed to behave however you want. \n\nGet therapy and get over yourself. Be grateful that you have a wife who is willing to accommodate and stand by you through major health crisis and minor towel mishaps, because right now you don\u2019t deserve her.", "\u201cThrough sickness\u201d does not mean she has to put up with emotional abuse.  Op is aware that his communication has changed as his wife cries often.

I know you want to move forward and try to put distance between what I would imagine to be a pretty traumatic time in your life, but judging from how you reacted to this situation, you aren\u2019t there yet. \n\nHave you thought about recording yourself during one of these conversations? Obviously ask permission of the person you\u2019re conversing with, but it might be a good way to get a different perspective.\n\nIt also might be time to get some professional relationship help.", "I mean, you're DEFINITELY still having severe anxiety.  I think you had a panic attack out there, and they are upsetting and infuriating and distressing.  You weren't happy that you felt that way, so you automatically looked for a way to push it away and make it not about you. \n\nI understand that you're probably struggling and it's very hard, and I sincerely feel for you.  But you're not handling it well enough.  These health problems you have had are not your fault, but they are YOUR problem.  Not hers.  You need to find a way to be more independent and solve your problems, but you're still in that early illness phase where you feel safer being dependant.  But that's over.  You're on the road to recovery.  Time to reduce the number of dependants your wife is caring for.", "Listen to your wife bro. Your anxiety has turned to anger. You were anxious about the towels... you blew up about them. Any comments but thanks for bringing them were inappropriate and rude.

I'm all, why didn't the guy WHOSE NOT AT WORK go back home? Like why bother your wife for something you can take care of yourself. He's blaming his wife FOR HIS MISTAKE.

You need a lot more cognitive and behavior and occupational therapy.", "Yes exactly!!!\n\nOP YTA in that particular situation, but... I want to point this out for everyone who has not had a stroke.... it literally changes your brain. The first six months are a hell of fatigue beyond fatigue not just whatever cognitive or physical problems it left you with. I have had two, and one of the biggest things now is I have a hair trigger I never had before. It's like the wiring of your brain has lost any insulation and sparks quicker. I have learned how to deal with it. It sounds like the OP is working on learning how to deal with his own post stroke stuff. It's not easy, fun or pretty and yeah, you're going to get some things very wrong and have to apologize and admit you're not all together there yet.", "While I tend to agree with you, strokes can cause personality changes.

Our swimming pool when I was young was never too cold, not even during winter. And it wasn't a tropical swim paradise either...", ">YTA get some therapy\n\nI agree with \"Get some therapy\", but it should be speech therapy and occupational therapy first.
