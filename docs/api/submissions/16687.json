It kind of died a bit for a while but has recently started to get popular again. I have been playing for years. My account is 18 years old and it has the stats to reflect that (pets/avatars/stamps/gallery/trophies etc.). If you don't play it may not mean alot and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.\n\nI 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(\n\nI recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).\n\nAnyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.\n\nWell he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.\n\nI feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up like this, much less make the front page! Thank you everyone for your responses (and for the reward/coins OMG). I promise I'm reading all of them and I'm making sure my family has the link so they can read them too. Hopefully we can have a civil conversation about it after reading all this. I have a nice NC background I know my niece will love I plan on sending her for her birthday.\n\nI'm glad if anything this post reminded everyone to feed their dying pets lol", "created_utc": 1683548730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bnk06/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_neopets_account/", "score": 7635, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d say your family are the A for even asking that of you. Your niece can work and earn the things she wants, that\u2019s the whole point of the game.

If you choose to gift it, that's your right and equally, it's your right to hang onto it. \n\nYou're clearly invested; both financially and emotionally, and your family is not respecting this and your boundaries.\n\nThe little girl is another matter. She's a child. However, I think you've been more than fair, gifting her items from the game and offering to interact with her in-game. Kids, whether they're sick or not, need to learn about boundaries, too. It's not good parenting to just give children everything they demand.", "NTA. She's sick yes.

She's eleven, not four. Learning to work for rewards herself, will help teach her that that's where the sense of accomplishment and meaning comes from in life, rather than cheating by buying your way to the top. \n\nI get that she's ill, and that's sad. Undoubtedly, she's already had to learn some rough lessons in her young life. But it doesn't mean she doesn't also have to learn the life lessons that will make her an honorable and accomplished person. \n\nReaching goals takes patience, persistence, and work. You can't learn these important qualities if you're just handed what you want because you cry for it. \n\nYou were already very kind. Giving up what you worked so long for would leave you without an account to share with your future kids, and your niece would learn nothing but greed. \n\n Perhaps you can both start a different game together and progress at the same pace.

Meaning that all that time and effort would come from me, I would not try to emotionally leverage someone else's time and effort to give to my child that's just ethically and morally wrong to me. \n\nMy other issue is what's to stop her from suddenly getting bored now that she has all the things on your account? She'd probably wind up not playing or liking neopets anymore because there wouldn't be a lot left for her to accomplish (you said yourself you've completed the ploys and such).\n\nThey would essentially be giving her your account for it to go inactive in a short time; and it's something you still use and enjoy.\n\nGood on you for encouraging her participation in the game and even giving her some things and teaching her. Those are all positive things and ways to give her lasting joy with a hobby. Gifting the results of a hobby instead of teaching it makes for spoiled and entitled people that can't appreciate the value of something.", "NTA. Part of the fun of the game is earning things and meeting your goals. Don\u2019t give up your account. I\u2019ve had mine since I was 11 and the memories and nostalgia make me happy.

This happened to me when a friend gave me an old account of hers. Oops!\n\nThen NEITHER of you will be able to enjoy it anyway. So again, NTA at all because it is yours and she has 0 claim to it. But doubly so because it would be pointless anyway and you will both be sad when it gets banned.", "NTA. I had no idea it was back and getting big again, might have to try and remember my old log in myself.

It\u2019s my stuff. \n\nHow ridiculous of them to ask. If it was your WOW account, would they think they would be justified to ask for that? Or perhaps a COD account or GW2 account. No, none of them would be okay to give away.", "As a newish neopets player NTA, while it's nice to receive items and knowledge from more seasoned players I would never demand someone give me more and the thought of \"I wish they would give me their acc\" never crossed my mind.

At all. \n\nYou may be an adult, but this is something you\u2019ve been doing since 2005, long before your niece was born.

She\u2019s 11 not 5. How is teaching her she can just take someone else\u2019s things just because she wants it going to benefit her in the long run? I understand that her parents just desperately want to make her happy but it shouldn\u2019t mean turning her into an entitled brat in the process.

Sometimes it can help other people to understand if you compare it to another type of hobby.  Like maybe instead of neopets your niece got into rebuilding cars and bought an old mustang to fix up.  You have been rebuilding cars for years and gave her some tips and tools to get started.  She tries but its taking her too long and she gets frustrated that she has nothing for an upcoming car show.

I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(\n\nI recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).\n\nAnyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.\n\nWell he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.\n\nI feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account.

I would imagine building up a new account with help from an experienced player would pass way more time\nthan just being given an account. 11 is old enough to learn to work towards something. Even if it\u2019s awards in a video game. \n\nBeyond that. How long will this keep your niece\u2019s attention? It\u2019s popular again now but when the fad fades will she stick with it?

Joy of a job well done and all that. Especially in the world of instant virtual gratification we live in, it's so important to teach children to value things that take time and effort.

Much in the same manner you wouldn't just give a child a few grand to do whatever they wanted because they don't understand the value of it.

She needs to learn to appreciate what she's gotten in Neopets instead of pining for what she doesn't.\n\nImagine if you asked your BiL to gift you whatever gamer profile he has on Xbox, PS, Nintendo, Roblox, Minecraft, Steam, etc. Plenty of games have a virtual world and economy that is worth thousands of dollars, not to mention the time invested in building these things.\n\nLastly, your parents, sister, and BiL are A-Hs for guilting you into giving your niece her way simply because \"it would mean the world to her.\" Heaven forbid she doesn't get a (in their words) a not \"real world thing\". By that logic, your niece shouldn't give a crap about Neopets and this account anyway.

I'm going to say that because it is not tangible, I think it shouldn't matter to him at all, and I could really use a lot of vacation time. I value that time but have decided that it has no tangible presence in his life therefore, MY LOGIC makes it completely unreasonable for him to not be willing to give it me.

Real friends won't treat you like this.", "Yeah, OP should point her BIL in the way of Clraik and _strictly_ tell him to buy her items, pets, or neopoints, because a 12 yo is going to get insta frozen otherwise. \n\nI know it might be controversial to tell OP to help her niece cheat but the girl is 12 years old and going to be in the hospital for her birthday so I hope I don\u2019t get judged too hard here", "Dude, I\u2019ve played neopets for 2 decades almost now too.  You\u2019re not TA.  The items alone you gave her could sell for awesome retired paintbrushes, petpets, etc.  A neopets account is a passion project; it\u2019s your nieces job to create hers (and what an awesome leg up you gave her)!  At least she isn\u2019t having to learn the brand new coding language HTML to decorate her user page and pet page \ud83d\ude02", ".. and let's not forget that she is 11. Easy come easy goes. She'll get bored of it fast and there goes your 18 years of commitment.", "I had no idea that there's a market for online game accounts. It's like the ultimate pay to win. What other games have this sort of community? I just don't understand the logic of the buyer. You play a game because you want to do the stuff it offers you. What's the point in owning a game when everything has already been done for you?", "Yep, this right here. The whole point of getting the stats, rewards, etc. is that they are recognition for your \\*achievements.\\*", "Your family is just terrible.  You should cut all contact with them. What an entitled bunch. How did you even come out of that narcissistic and horrible environment.", "Literally \\*just\\* signed into my account for the first time in............. I dunno, at least 6-7 years. My pets are still there! And they still have their awesome names! LOL. And my oldest pet is 8033 days old!"]}
