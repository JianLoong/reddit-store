It kind of died a bit for a while but has recently started to get popular again. I have been playing for years. My account is 18 years old and it has the stats to reflect that (pets/avatars/stamps/gallery/trophies etc.). If you don't play it may not mean alot and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.\n\nI 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(\n\nI recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).\n\nAnyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.\n\nWell he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.\n\nI feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account.

They should start parenting and learn her that the world doesn't evolve around her.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd please don't give her you account. She should learn to work for something instead of having it handed over because she wants it.", "NTA.   \nKeep it.   \nStop giving her stuff, you are only enabling her sense of entitlement.", "Hey, another Neopian!  Always fun to find each other in the wild.\n\nAlso NTA, she can *earn* her stats just like you did.", "NTA. having read some of the /r/hobbydrama write ups on neopets, I can understand that it means a lot to a lot of people. you should be under no obligation to give up what means so much to you as a gift to anyone.\n\nI'm big into cycling and if someone asked me to gift my bike to make their kid happy i'd tell them to fuck off. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d say your family are the A for even asking that of you. Your niece can work and earn the things she wants, that\u2019s the whole point of the game.

If you choose to gift it, that's your right and equally, it's your right to hang onto it. \n\nYou're clearly invested; both financially and emotionally, and your family is not respecting this and your boundaries.\n\nThe little girl is another matter. She's a child. However, I think you've been more than fair, gifting her items from the game and offering to interact with her in-game. Kids, whether they're sick or not, need to learn about boundaries, too. It's not good parenting to just give children everything they demand.", "NTA. She's sick yes. But your bil cannot demand something you spent years building because of that sickness. Its not his to bargain for. Your niece needs to learn that she will have to build her account up the same way you have.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your niece is sick, but your brother is an AH for demanding your neopet.", "NTA I\u2019m a parent myself (and while I don\u2019t play this game) I definitely get why you account is important to you. The fact that they are trying to guilt trip you is completely insane. You gifted her a bunch of stuff and that was their opportunity as parents to teach her gratitude and how to show appreciation; instead they took the opportunity to teach her she is entitled to more and the world should cater to her.", "NTA. She's eleven, not four. Learning to work for rewards herself, will help teach her that that's where the sense of accomplishment and meaning comes from in life, rather than cheating by buying your way to the top. \n\nI get that she's ill, and that's sad. Undoubtedly, she's already had to learn some rough lessons in her young life. But it doesn't mean she doesn't also have to learn the life lessons that will make her an honorable and accomplished person. \n\nReaching goals takes patience, persistence, and work. You can't learn these important qualities if you're just handed what you want because you cry for it. \n\nYou were already very kind. Giving up what you worked so long for would leave you without an account to share with your future kids, and your niece would learn nothing but greed. \n\n Perhaps you can both start a different game together and progress at the same pace. Pokemon Go maybe?", "NTA, no one is entitled to someone else's property", "NTA\n\nThat is your account, not hers. You have spent years of your life building that account, just because she \"wants a better one\" she does not deserve it.\n\nYou were kind enough to gift her things in game, but that was a gift. You do not owe giving her your account.", "NTA\nyou've already been super nice and your niece and BIL should be grateful for that.\n\nThe way your BIL is acting is unfair and I don't think they realise what dedication you've put into this. It's probably worth thousands but it's the time and effort that is the thing.\n\nDon't back down and if they continue then withdrawal from them.\n\nIt's unfortunate that she's unwell but expectations are far  higher than what they should be.\n\nHold your ground and don't budge an inch.\n\nThis advice from my late father may help you in future.\n\"If you have something that means a lot to you, keep it to yourself or it won't be yours for very long\".\n\nHope they back down and this doesn't escalate, it's about right and wrong though and they need to be the ones apologising for over expecting.\n\nAnd BIL - stop being an AH. I get it, your child is sick and you'd do anything to help, but this attitude is showing your daughter to be overly expectant of things. Wind it in a bit please and be grateful for what OP has already done or you may lose that in the future.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s against the T&S of the site and they could freeze the account if made aware of the situation - but i\u2019m sure your family is \u201cnot understanding\u201d this scenario on purpose, albeit inadvertently, because they\u2019re blinded by the fact that \u201cit\u2019s a kids site.\u201d As a fellow neo-millennial, we both know how not kid friendly that entire site actually it and how much monetary value one account can hold. If he wants to risk his daughters account getting frozen, show him the black market websites where he can buy aged accounts! \n\n\nA happy medium (for your conscious, no one else\u2019s) might be asking what her dream pet is then trying to find her one on PC/Trade for a custom. Otherwise, she can learn like we all did.", "NTA - There's no reason a child can't learn to earn their rewards. She will have way more fun and feel proud of herself if she plays the game and earns things on her own. The fact that she doesn't understand that seems like she isn't that interested in the game and it's just a passing interest for her. \n\nKeep your account, you've earned it and you should enjoy it!

As with you, I'll help him with some tricks to get better at playing but he's not getting my legendaries!", "NTA. This is essentially the same as an entitled child asking for any personal item of yours.

I hope your niece gets well soon, but giving in to her every desire will create a entitled young woman with unreasonable expectations from life which will lead to misery for all.

Keep playing ad enjoying upur neopets.", "NTA, why are people so entitled?! It is very sad that she is sickly and has to spend the birthday in the hospital but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone gives her exactly what she wants. You already gifted her awesome stuff in the game, but she needs to put in the time herself. If anything, maybe offer her some tips/tricks to get her going. \n\nBIL/Sis if you\u2019re reading this, yeah. Your kid is the most precious special in the whole world to YOU. Not to everyone else.

Meaning that all that time and effort would come from me, I would not try to emotionally leverage someone else's time and effort to give to my child that's just ethically and morally wrong to me. \n\nMy other issue is what's to stop her from suddenly getting bored now that she has all the things on your account? She'd probably wind up not playing or liking neopets anymore because there wouldn't be a lot left for her to accomplish (you said yourself you've completed the ploys and such).\n\nThey would essentially be giving her your account for it to go inactive in a short time; and it's something you still use and enjoy.\n\nGood on you for encouraging her participation in the game and even giving her some things and teaching her. Those are all positive things and ways to give her lasting joy with a hobby. Gifting the results of a hobby instead of teaching it makes for spoiled and entitled people that can't appreciate the value of something.", "NTA. Part of the fun of the game is earning things and meeting your goals. Don\u2019t give up your account. I\u2019ve had mine since I was 11 and the memories and nostalgia make me happy. It\u2019s a great escape from the world.", "Not only NTA, but giving her the account is against Neopets rules.\n\nWhat is likely to happen is that if you did give it away and the account starts acting strange (ie. not like you) or she attempts to change the account details to her own, The Neopets Team will probably freeze (ban) the account. This happened to me when a friend gave me an old account of hers. Oops!\n\nThen NEITHER of you will be able to enjoy it anyway. So again, NTA at all because it is yours and she has 0 claim to it. But doubly so because it would be pointless anyway and you will both be sad when it gets banned.", "NTA. I had no idea it was back and getting big again, might have to try and remember my old log in myself. It's your account which you still actively use, You've already gifted her some stuff and offered her tips, it's unreasonable for them to expect you to just give up an account which is decades old.", "Of course NTA.

That\u2019s spoiled behavior on each of their parts.", "NTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t give my neopets account to someone else either not even my own kids. I\u2019m 34f as well and I have children. It\u2019s my stuff. \n\nHow ridiculous of them to ask. If it was your WOW account, would they think they would be justified to ask for that? Or perhaps a COD account or GW2 account. No, none of them would be okay to give away.", "As a newish neopets player NTA, while it's nice to receive items and knowledge from more seasoned players I would never demand someone give me more and the thought of \"I wish they would give me their acc\" never crossed my mind. She's very entitled and all the trophies wouldn't even matter as she didn't earn them. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. At all. \n\nYou may be an adult, but this is something you\u2019ve been doing since 2005, long before your niece was born. You have spent your time doing something you enjoy and it is perfectly okay not to turn that over to your niece. \n\nWhat could have been something to do together has now become a point of contention due to your BIL and sister\u2019s demands. You could have spent time with your niece showing her awesome stuff and helping her level up or whatever. But that\u2019s ruined. Her parents *demanding* you turn over your account instead of telling niece no was super wrong. \n\nBIL and sister - it\u2019s awful your child has such big health issues. But you\u2019re raising someone to think that demanding what\u2019s not hers is okay. Don\u2019t do that. There\u2019s so much selfish behavior in the world today; please stop contributing to that.", "NTA - I\u2019m sympathetic to your niece and what she\u2019s going through but I have no sympathy for her terrible attitude. She\u2019s 11 not 5. How is teaching her she can just take someone else\u2019s things just because she wants it going to benefit her in the long run? I understand that her parents just desperately want to make her happy but it shouldn\u2019t mean turning her into an entitled brat in the process. The whole joy of playing a game is to earn and progress, what\u2019s the point if she\u2019s just handed it all? Where is the fun in that?", "\u201cIt\u2019s against the T&C of having an account.

If they can identify who is using my account now, they will also ban any other account that new player has.\n\nThis means that ALL the valuable stuff on MY account will be lost. At least if I keep the account, then I will be able to continue giving her items that I have earnt over the past 18 years.\n\nThe risk of us both losing our accounts, because I gave her mine is NOT worth it.\u201d\n\nAs a player on a different game that lasted 8 years (I played for 6 - when the game closed) which had similar T&C it isn\u2019t worth it.", "Nta.

To them its just like another toy and not a record of the time and effort spent that you can be proud of.  Sometimes it can help other people to understand if you compare it to another type of hobby.  Like maybe instead of neopets your niece got into rebuilding cars and bought an old mustang to fix up.  You have been rebuilding cars for years and gave her some tips and tools to get started.  She tries but its taking her too long and she gets frustrated that she has nothing for an upcoming car show.

If you don't play it may not mean alot if you don't play and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.\n\nI 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(\n\nI recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).\n\nAnyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.\n\nWell he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.\n\nI feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she\u2019s\u2026dying (I\u2019m very sorry if this is the case) I think itd be reasonable for you to let her use the account while supervised, maybe while you visit her? Or if you set certain boundaries and she follows them she could use the account, it would still be yours and you could still use it but maybe she could use it at certain times or something.  Also would explain why the parents are freaking out so hard if they are otherwise reasonable people.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting to give up your account, but I do think it would be kind of you to share it in some way.", "NTA, I bet in 6 months she might just stop\nPlaying it and you would still be sad that you gave her your account. Do not do this at all.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t discuss it further. Say no, period, and change the subject. Refuse to engage. These people are being ridiculous and petty. If you feel like you need to block them, do it. Sick or not, your niece and her parents need to learn that not everything will be given to them.", " NTA. \nIt could have been a really cool bonding moment for the two of you to play together. Her birthday you could have gifted her an item in the game. Kids need to learn they can\u2019t have something just cause they like it. \n\nThe kids been sick, but will benefit by still being treated like a normal kid. \n\nYour family doesn\u2019t get to decide what you value, and don\u2019t appreciate or teach child to appreciate how awesome the in game goodies you gave are. \n\nYour game isn\u2019t any different then any other hobby. You helped her get ahead with your shared interest, you are not required to give up your interests.", "I tried that logic. He (and my parents) said it's not the same because a car is a real world thing with monetary use and value while neopets is just a virtual game that can disappear at anytime if they shut the servers down.", "Agreed NTA. I hope OP feels good about their current generosity (gifting nice items to niece.) \n\nIts a shame this is a missed learning opportunity for the little girl. Video games can be a shared hobby with strong in person connections. Some of my friends in life started with video games and even now people I'm friends with today can continue keeping in touch through video games and their shared experiences. \n\nOP you're doing great. I personally wouldn't monetize further transactions or make it a habit of continuing to buy gifts for your niece in this way (maybe her own in game currency? Or just physical items relating to gaming or interests.) I'd keep them small and focused on what she wants as rewards for trying. Don't hold your families (wrong) opinions and objections against her. A lot of children grow out if these phases.", "Hopping on here to say the same thing - stop giving her in-game things. Everyone is acting entitled and they\u2019re trying to guilt you. Don\u2019t fall for it. You\u2019ve worked very hard for that. NTA and tell them that NO IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE!", "i'd gift this kid my bike\n\n...because i found a crack in my top tube welds this morning", "Part of the reason is there are some things that she just CAN'T get, no matter what. Avatars and trophies and things that were only given out during certain events and never will be given again. There are even some I'm missing from events that happened before I joined I'll never be able to get. And I have alot of those kinds of time-sensitive things.", "What on Fyora's green neoearth items are worth 50+ caps? OMG \ud83d\ude32 Glad I only do minimal NC trading. What items do I need to not fall in love with? lol", "yeah well you cannot teach what you don't know, seems the family doesn't have those skills anyway.", "I mean...I don't play it for HOURS everyday but dailies is a big part of the site especially if you want to earn NP. I get on for a bit every morning before work to do my dailies. Food Club, Stocks, Battledome, other small things. Maybe check out the neoboards or chat in my guild for a bit. Unless a big event is going on it really doesn't take up that much time.\n\nOf course I care about my niece, which is why I am so conflicted. I just have put 18 YEARS into this and there are things I can no I will never get back if I just let it go.", "\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what is making you think this is a concern. What\u2019s wrong with playing a game daily? Someone can pick up a different game every day for an hour after work and that can be considered normal, but an hour a day of the same game is not? Substitute an hour or two of playing Neopets with any hobby, to unwind\u2014why is doing something OP enjoys daily a concern?\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with caring about a game deeply? I can care about a hobby a lot, so why is caring about an online pet site a concern? I spent 10 years building my book collection. If you told me to gift my entire collection to a child, and told me I\u2019m selfish for refusing, I\u2019d be pretty sad too. Three to five books? No problem. But I have some first edition stuff, signed copies, etc. This is no different for OP.\n\nWhat is giving you the right to judge what\u2019s normal or not? Just because it\u2019s an online pet site? It\u2019s a game? Why is this not normal? People have different likes, different hobbies.", "The niece can earn stuff like the rest of Neopets users have. That\u2019s the fun of the game. Sorry to tell you this, but nobody cares what *you* think is normal. You don\u2019t know OP and you know nothing about Neopets.", "So can money in a bank, that's all virtual numbers (see all the banking collapse/trading shorts issues) as no government is still on the gold standard.\n\nAlso i just quickly googled and a neopets account is worth roughly on average  $35 per 50m points. So theres real world value.\n\nThats not including special items etc let alone personal value to it\n\nYes the account is virtual but the time spent on it isn't.  And if the neopets account has no value or is just a game then your niece doesn't need your account as her account is the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPewdiepie/Jack Septic Eye/Ninja etc made millions from playing games, but i bet your family think they need 'real' jobs", "Money = time you spent earning them. Time is the \"equity\" (not sure if it's correct term) here. They can't give you time spent on building the account but since time and money can be converted into each other, there is a monetary value for your account -) you can make some calculation on spent time and hour labor costs and get the amount to ask, which will be astronomical.", "Except your BIL offered you money for the account. He thinks it has monetary value.", "OP, it\u2019s like someone asking you to give them your childhood photos. The monetary value isn\u2019t what\u2019s at stake, the sentimental value is. NTA.", "Ask him for any crypto and NFTs he has. NTA", "You could let him know that account sharing is against the game's TOS and if you give your niece the account it'll probably get banned (idek if that's even true but it's a clause in a lot of games' TOS for liability reasons, so might be worth a shot telling him if it means he'll back off)", "It's still worth the amount of time and resources you spent into it. Or do they also not believe in the concept of time?", "If your sibling gets this far here are some lessons that are applicable (many more apply)\n\n-Sharing (you gave her stuff already)\n\n-Equity vs equality (you've been playing longer and helped her out, that was so nice of you, now she can learn and play too! -The nice things are just that, nice to have, not needs.)\n\n-The game isn't to collect things its to share fun together\n\n-Status items in the game to get people to treat you differently isn't how the worldn(should) work. \n\n-The ppl who are nice when you don't have much are your true friends and people may bully you for being different but _____ is how you should handle them (block them, ignore them, take a break, reframe your expectations and their behavior etc.)", "I understand that can be frustrating for a child, but she still has to learn that not everything will be hers, easy to get, or possible to acquire. The parents should be teaching her this, and this is a really good opportunity to do so.", "I joined in 2007 ish. I was around your niece\u2019s age. I know I missed a LOT of plots. You know what my reaction was upon finding out I missed a ton of plots? \u201cAw that sucks, but from now on I am here and won\u2019t miss anything!\u201d Still missed a lot of stuff due to various hiatus and also the ass move that was the last day of the recent Negg Festival (rip background, did not get it\u2014thought the Bython marked the last day).\n\nYour niece needs to learn that not everything can be gotten. I learned this lesson myself and got my sense of entitlement slapped out of me (figuratively) by my mom. I worked towards achievable trophies, dream pets, building up my avatar/stamp/card counts. Building my gallery. Making my account my OWN.\n\nYou also mentioned in your post that she doesn\u2019t want to be treated as a newbie by other players. She\u2019s still a newbie with your account, whether she likes it or not. No one treats anyone badly on Neopets, especially newbies. Im not sure where that is coming from.", "City in space, contagious, rooftop, cherry blossom garland, and a lot more \ud83d\ude06 if you go through /~Owls you'll find a lot of these expensive ass things", "Don\u2019t listen to that person. Your niece needs to learn how to work for things. It\u2019s a good lesson for her. And it\u2019s none of their business if you play and nobody cares what they think is \u201cnormal\u201d.", "As someone who has played Neopets for 15 years and have a completely normal level of empathy and common sense, the person you\u2019re replying to is an asshole. I understand the importance of the site to you. My account is important to me too, and it is a website I\u2019ve put a lot of work into as well. Don\u2019t let this one person\u2019s response get to you\u2014you are NTA. I\u2019d gift my cousin who plays anything she asked (within reason, I obviously cannot afford a SuAP, but a Pastel PB is fine), but I\u2019m not letting go of my account.", "I would hope that your relationship with your niece is more rewarding than this game? Do you have any hobbies? Maybe this wouldn\u2019t just be a great gift to your niece but also to yourself, to have more external interests.", "Huh...well I don't have alot of NP right now, mostly cause I've spent it on stuff, but I totaled up all the items in my gallery recently and all the items were worth about 1 billion NP together....Wow", "Kindle books; Audible audiobooks; iTunes music; all your Google home automation; the YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch accounts that earn some people serious money...those all can \"disappear at anytime if they shut the servers down\".

Let people enjoy things. You miserable fuck.", "You can fuck right off with that, it's her account, if the niece wants a nice account she can build it up herself. Not to mention the account would most likely be frozen as you're not allowed to give accounts away like that, so 18+ years of work would get flushed down the drain.\n\nThe niece should put in effort to make something she's proud of, not taking over someone's hard work.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself, trying to guilt someone over enjoying a game.", "Or this could be a teaching moment where the child learns you don't always get what you want.", "What? This is so judgemental. This game is clearly a hobby, and one that's important to the OP. It may not be to your taste, or maybe you don't understand it, but it's an activity that has required years of investment and nurturing. It's as rewarding to the OP as a garden would be to someone else. If the OP's hobby were DIY, would you recommend she hand over a renovated house because her niece suddenly discovered hammers?\n\nNTA. \n\nI feel for a young girl experiencing what she's going through, but if this game means that much to her, she will find it much more rewarding in the end to build her own account to such a level, and to have a chance to share the experience with an aunt who can appreciate how meaningful it can be. I hope her parents can help her understand the value of this instead of teaching her by their example that it's okay to bully people into handing over whatever she wants.", "People go on social media for hours a day, I don\u2019t think OP has an issue just because they check their neo pet account daily.", "So even on the raw value not including age of account, special items, unique items etc etc you are looking at least $700 ish\n\nGiven everything else it could be way way higher, i knew WoW accounts that went for 1000s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is also from player accounts selling (mostly botted) accounts which will be cheaper than a properly looked after aged account\n\nAnyway not trying to get your to sell, just trying to give you ammo (beyond the 'No is a complete sentence') to try reason with them (i have lesser version with my family that online and games etc are waste of time but sports/soaps/reality tv are ok)"]}
