My first 2 pregnancies have gone quite smoothly, with a few bumps on the way but not much problems.

I stayed in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks before I was deemed healthy enough to be released. \nMy husband has been beside me in the delivery room all 3 times and does most of the chores and takes care of the kids while I recover and makes sure I have everything I need.We have saved more than enough money from both our jobs to have the ability to afford to stay at home for as long as is needed.\nMy best friend (we'll call her Ashley) has been my bff since elementary school. We've never missed each others birthdays no matter what was going on in our lives or how far apart we were. She also was aware of my troubles.\nYesterday was her birthday. In the morning I was feeling below par and I was too tired to get out of bed so my husband took care of all the kids and helped me shower like he did a 100x before during my pregnancies and postpartum. When it was around 2 pm, I was feeling a little better but I was still worn-out so I called Ashley. \nHer birthday party was scheduled at 3pm and I was supposed to arrive at 2:30 pm.

I told her that \"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I won't be able to come to your birthday party because I'm not feeling well.\" She asked what was wrong, and I told her that I was extremely exhausted and there was no way I can be at her party. I literally heard her sigh angrily and she said \"But what about our promise? I broke my arm while racing and still traveled a 1000 miles for your birthday, but you can't drive 20 miles to see me? If your fat ass can reach the grocery store, then you would come here if you actually cared\". That's when I became mad and told her \"Well if you had kids then you would understand \" and that's when she said \"F*ck you\" and hung up. (That wasn't the entire conversation). You might think \"what's so bad about saying if you had kids?\". Ashley can't get pregnant due to an incident that happened during our younger college days and the topic is very sensitive for her, so me saying that was extremely vile. \nThis morning, I woke up feeling much better and I attempted to contact Ashley so I could apologize but she wouldn't pick up and ignored all my text messages. My husband said that I shouldn't apologize because if she was a real friend she would have shown concern and worry instead of anger and the attitude of a brat so she deserved my comeback, but I feel so guilty for bringing up her inability to have kids and I feel like such an asshole for doing so.

Calling 1/2 hour before you were supposed to arrive is pretty thoughtless, especially as it seems she was counting on you to help with setting up before 3:00.

This could've been mitigated if you had told her about your exhaustion earlier. Also, you said you were feeling a little better at 2PM and it would be reasonable to believe that you'd continue to feel better once you went to the birthday.", "YTA - either you and your husband are a perfect match due to being so vile, or he\u2019s a bad influence on you. \nIt could also be you\u2019re a bad influence on him.

You punched real real low.", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nHealth comes first, although, I feel like maybe there was a way to show up for a few minutes based on what you're saying. Especially if she really did makeit 1000 miles with a broken limb for yours. Waiting until the last minute regardless of your reasoning was rude and extremely disrespectful of her time.\n\n..why the FUCK would you say that to someone who wants kids and can't have them? That's beyond careless or thoughtless. That was outright cruel. She's supposed to be your best friend and you dug at her in such a painful way.\n\nPutting your kids and family first is natural. Longstanding friendships don't always survive the life changes. That's okay. What's not okay, and something I've seen before, is suddenly disregarding your existing friends' feelings entirely once you have kids. Sounds like that's happening here. \n\nYou owe her a HUGE apology but honestly if I were her I wouldn't speak to you again honestly.", "You knew exactly how to hit Ashley where it hurts, YTA for leaving it to the last minute to tell her, for blaming the baby for being moody, most of all for throwing in Ashley\u2019s face the fact she can\u2019t have kids.", "YTA take a nap. Stop complaining. Be a better friend.", "YTA. I had a traumatic twin birth and emergency c-section and almost died. And you know what? I\u2019m still not an a-h to my friends. You\u2019re just mean and cruel and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t want to be your friend anymore. You threw her infertility back in her face.", "Oooo this hit me some kind of way.\n\nI have had trouble conceiving. So I am very sensitive to your former BFF. She reacted to you canceling 30 minutes to Splashdown. Let's remove the reasons. She got angry that you canceled 1/2 hour BEFORE YOU WERE TO ARRIVE ON HER BIRTHDAY. I would be salty too. Had you canceled at 8am, 11am, or even noon that could have given her a little leeway to alter things.\n\nYou said something completely unforgivable in my mind. And I cut my BFF out for texting me at my rehearsal dinner \"Sorry. I'm not coming.\" Girl... I hope you make friends easily because she's gone for good. And I hope you are speaking to your doctor if 4 months postpartum is still requiring assistance for you.\n\nYTA", "YTH, but for your pregnancy comment not bailing on the party. That was cruel, but you already acknowledged that. Give it some time and reach out again to apologize. \n\nShe was also cruel with that grocery store comment. That comment seems out of place, but I dont know your history or friendship. She sounds selfish with the way she reacted. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou went for the lowest possible blow you had.  Yuck.\n\nFrankly, a grade school promise to always be there for each other's birthdays is ridiculous.  Life happens.  That she refuses to understand that - especially having full knowledge of how difficult your pregnancy and birth were - tells me that, emotionally, she's still stuck in grade school.  She's not some kind of hero for traveling 1000 miles with a broken arm.\n\nFocus on your new baby and leave Ashley alone for a while.", "YTA. She drove SO far just to see you, and you weaponize her biggest insecurity against her? Wow. You're a horrific person. Truly the lowest of the low, to use what is told to you in confidence against her. I hope she blocks you and NEVER thinks about you again.", "YTA.\n\nShe reacted badly but you bailed last minute so I understand why she was hurt. It would have been much better to let her know first thing in the morning what was going on.

ESH but more YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf after your child is 4 months old you are still so exhausted that you have to get help to get out of bed and shower you should be at the emergency room because there is something seriously wrong.    \nI woke up exhausted and in pain this morning.  It was a struggle to drag myself out of bed but do you know where I am?  Work because I have to be.  Reality is if you really wanted to be at her party you would have been.\n\nAnd then to take her annoyance because you were cancelling at the last minute and go full scorched earth on her?  That petty and low.", "Wow, these comments are wild. One question: Why is a 36 year old woman having a tantrum about you missing her birthday party? The comment about her not having children was uncalled for, especially if you intended to hurt her feelings. You went through a traumatic birth and are still recovering. Personally, I don't get why she wasn't more understanding of your condition. Just my opinion.", "I'm going against the grain and going to say NTA for everything but your last comment to your friend about her infertility. I will also say that you and your friend have been friends for a long time now...this is something that could be easily worked out with apologies (from both of you to one another) and an actual conversation about what happened. I can understand calling out at the last minute as well with wanting to be completely sure before bailing on your best friend's birthday party. She should have accepted it with a bit more grace like she could've said oh I'm sorry you're feeling that way, I'm a bit disappointed because we had made a promise. Instead she blew up at you and hurled a promise in your face that was made years ago before life happened. However, I am noticing strong signs of PPD in your behavior. \n\nPPD is not something to be taken lightly. Ive had depression all my life but when I had PPD that was probably the worst bout of depression I've ever gotten in my life. It took years for me to recover and that was with ONE pregnancy with relatively little complications. I can't imagine how it must've been for you, OP, with such a traumatic birth then having to take care of two LOs on top of that. I'm glad your husband is there for you but YOU need to get help ASAP for that-not just for you, your husband, and your children but for the people involved in your life as well. \n\nI will also say for other Redditors-her ppd is not an excuse for her behavior. If she continued like this and refuses to get help then that's on her all the way. Additionally, if your advice to OP is to not have any more kids, that's unrealistic. Either way it's done, she already has three whole kids, and her life has been changed forever. \n\nOP, a conversation needs to be had with your friend. We all make mistakes, we're only human. But if you value your friend and everyone else around you your PPD has to be addressed. I wish the best of luck to you.", "I\u2019m honestly super confused. Why is your husband helping you shower 4 months after you delivered a baby? And doing everything for you and the kids? This is not a healthy or sustainable situation for you or your husband. \n\nYTA but you have to know that. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around and you.", "ESH she was being a brat but you really went for the jugular", "ESH. Her comments were emotionally manipulative and yours were mean. She should understand that health comes first and you should understand that poking a sore spot like that is a dick move.", "ESH. Your friend is an asshole for not being understanding of, or caring about, your health. You are a massive asshole for throwing someone's infertility in their face as soon as they something shitty to you. \n\nYou've also said that this infertility is due to an \"incident\" that happened in college that was a sensitive topic.

Honestly, she should never speak to you again.", "I\u2019m going with ESH and a *mild* YTA. She showed very entitled behavior after a very traumatic situation that you experienced. Being your friend for so long, you would think she\u2019d show some compassion/empathy, but your comment was way below the belt. *However*, due to the traumatic pregnancy and birth process, and all of the post party hormones *and* feeling not up to par, it isn\u2019t unlikely that you didn\u2019t even think about what you were saying in the moment and were operating off emotions. Now that doesn\u2019t excuse what you said, but it does explain it. With all of that being said, it\u2019s likely your friendship is over, so I wouldn\u2019t expect her to answer any of your calls or accept your apology.", "ESH.", "NTA she took the situation from 0 to 100 and you matched her speed. Birthdays are for children not functioning adults. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but your tradition is a fashion accessorie to her not a close friendship. I\u2019ve been to my closest friends birthday like 3 times at best and neither of us care.", "I agree with your husband. She needs to get her head out of her ass and be a friend. I can\u2019t believe she compared breaking her arm to almost dying. She broke her arm. She wasn\u2019t forced onto bed rest for six weeks, feeling like shit as she grew another human being in her stretched belly, she didn\u2019t almost lose her life or her baby\u2019s life, she didn\u2019t get cut open, she didn\u2019t have her entire belly stitched/stapled/glued back up\u2014whatever they do nowadays\u2014she doesn\u2019t have to deal with post pregnancy hormones, or her milk coming in/and/or breastfeeding while trying to bond with her newborn AND still somehow showing her other kids love, along with her husband who is fiercely protecting their world so it doesn\u2019t burn down while worrying about his wife as she heals. Should you have made the child comment, no, but you\u2019re not yourself right now. It\u2019s allowed.

You both had some low blows.", "I agree with ESH but I disagree that OP sucks more than friend. C section recovery is no joke and friend should have been understanding. \n\nIMO you had complete control of the moral high ground until you brought up her infertility. \n\nPost partum life is absolutely incomprehensible to those who haven't been through it, ESPECIALLY for C-section moms. Everything you did is forgiveable, right up until you said what you said. \n\nApologize for your words but stand by your decisions.", "NTA.  Friends since elementary school, but she can't accept that you've just been through absolute hell (and nearly stayed there!), and your body's just not up to travelling yet?  That you only waited until the last minute because you kept trying to be okay enough to keep your promise, and did everything in your power to make it happen, shows you did your best.  Travelling with a broken arm is not the same.  Not even in the same ballpark, and she's an incredibly entitled brat for even thinking it might be.\n\nPre-eclampsia kills.  And a C-section is a major surgical procedure that requires months to *properly* recover from.  Your husband gets it, why can't your best friend?  I agree, mentioning her inability to have children was a nasty little dig, but I'm willing to bet that she took a dig or three at you that wasn't mentioned, as well, which made you feel you had no choice but to dig back.  Even in this day and age, pregnancy and childbirth take a huge toll on a woman's physical, mental, and emotional health, and not every woman has a \"perfect\" pregnancy or experiences an easy birth.  It's okay to feel bad about snapping in anger or out of exhaustion, but your friend needs to grow up and learn compassion.", "NTA. Your friend extremely overreacted about your cancellation and knew what you were going through.  It just didn't seem to matter since it's her birthday party.  She was unnecessarily mean first.  You shouldn't have gone there, but she shouldn't be pressuring you and calling you fat a$s.  What kind of friend is that?  I can see why you snapped.  Apologize for that part, but not the whole thing.  If you weren't feeling well, she's not owed an apology.  She should be apologizing for caring more about her birthday, like a five year old than her best friend.", "NTA but Ashley is\u2026 very immature and selfish of her.", "NTA she asked for it", "I probably would have done the same thing and canceled. \n\nYou\u2019re a mom of a newborn and two kids!

Whoop dee doo, you were born this week. Let\u2019s go get wasted and have fun (literally what I did for this birthday). If words hurt her than actions are sure to kill her. You should learn to bite your tongue on sensitive subjects, and she should learn to quit whining like a brat. You\u2019re both children.", "ESH. What you said was harsh, her calling you a fat arse was uncalled for. Bit toxic tbh that you both seem to have this no matter what approach, you shouldn't be asked to show up no matter how you feel after a traumatic surgery and she shouldn't have driven for so long with a broken arm years ago. You're both keeping each other up to unreasonable standards", "ESH, y\u2019all got emotional when you could have tried to work it out together.

Get a shrink to talk to, ask your OB if they have anything that can help. Get right with yourself for your family. Your girl ran her mouth, but your kids are innocent, so don't let this anger take over. The babies don't deserve it.\n\nWhen you find your emotional balance again, maybe go talk to her. If you want.

Add in you bringing up her infertility and maybe this should be a YTA.", "ESH. She didn't take into account your health and tried to belittle you about it.

Don't bring up someone's painful experiences just to hurt them. It's time you two take a break from each other. You had every right not to go, she didn't need to express anger at that.

I can't imagine ever saying this to one of my closest friends who can't have kids and desperately wants them. She's 100% auntie and I involve her in everything I can because she loves this stuff. Now that being said. You need to talk to your doctor about PPD PPA and post partum rage. So many people on here are just saying your hiding your last pregnancy as an excuse for being mean but it really sounds like your last pregnancy ha thrown you for a loop physically, emotionally, and hormonally. Your not using your child as your excuse. Giving birth has completely fucked up your system for the time being. Your doctor and a therapist can help. However don't present that as an excuse in your apology. Simply state that your story you brought this big insecurity into this picture. You understand that she might want to go no contact with your for a while. Your sorry to have pushed that etc. You're looking into getting help for the physical and mental issues your suffering from, and your sorry you took some of that out on her. Leave it as a voice message if she won't answer or as a text message and let her reach out when she is ready. You hurt her deeply and she's likely going to need time and space to heal. Let her have that.", "How long are you going to blame your pregnancy on everything?

Although your guilt is justified I feel either your friend thinks pregnancy and c section surgery is easy or is super jealous that you get to have kids and she doesn't.\nHow entitled is she to expect you to come to her birthday party when you are physically incapable?

The woman had severe complications with birth, and that genuinely does take a long time to recover- A stupid broken arm doesn't compare. I genuinely believe OP has postpartum rage which is a symptom of trauma during birth and stuff. Yes, she could've told her friend sooner, I can totally understand why the friend would be angry about that, but her anger with it turning into her insulting her was alot different. To me it genuinely does sound like the friend has some resentment that OP can have kids and she can't. The friend being mad and frustrated, ok. The friend insulting the way OP looks because she's mad, not okay. They grey area, which really makes it ESH, is what OP said. Me personally, when I'm in that much pain and you're treating me like I absolutely betrayed you and insulting me like that, In the moment I would've said it too.

So while I agree you shouldn\u2019t have said it, I think your friend has been unfair to you.

The other comments suggest that \u201c you\u2019re one of those moms \u201c I say they\u2019re also being overly emotional and I\u2019m sorry if reading through these comments make you feel terrible. I\u2019d just like to tell you that it\u2019s perfectly fine to cancel because you feel too exhausted. You just went about it the wrong way and also terrible things were said.

Of course you shouldn't have said what you did, but Ashley shouldn't have responded in anger to a friend who is struggling. I understand the lashing out because I did the same thing a few times during my recovery. Pregnancy hormones already mess up our ability to regulate our emotions but adding a near-death experience along with the uncertainty during recovery is a recipe for volatility. Be gentle with yourself, focus on your recovery, and immerse yourself in the joy of the newest life your body gave its all to create. Give Ashley time to cool down. If you guys have been friends for that long, she'll likely want to talk at some point. Use this time to get your head in a healthier place so you can respond appropriately when she does. Good luck to you, OP. It really does get easier with time and the trauma will stop sitting in the forefront of your mind.", "NTA. Honestly I see why everyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole for that comment it was insensitive, but she called you fat and lazy rather than being an actually concerned friend.

That is not how life works. \n\nI understand waiting to call off in hopes that you feel better, but she didn\u2019t even let you explain. All the people saying you should have sucked it up and went anyways are unrealistic. If you had gone and not been as chipper do you think this friend wouldn\u2019t have taken that just as personally?

Ashley is acting like it\u2019s her 16th birthday, not 36th. \n\nEven if Ashley didn\u2019t have kids by choice, it\u2019s an extremely condescending attitude to tell someone they don\u2019t get it because they don\u2019t have kids. There are far more mature ways to communicate that you\u2019re busy and stressed.", "Was the 2pm call the only communication? You really should have been giving her updates days before saying how you are not doing well, and will do everything you can to make it, but can't guarantee you will be well enough to go.

I know you have other stuff on your mind, but you definitely didn't handle it very well.\n\nYour comment makes you TA.", "YTA, she was wrong as well but you went to a nuclear option.", "So you don\u2019t care about your BFF?

You purposely wanted to hurt her. You comment was meant to hurt her to her souls and well pregnancy has made me mean is your excuse. It\u2019s all cool. You have your husband and your children and she can go live her life without the person that was suppose to be her best friend.  Ashley was pretty rude. But you are right what you said was vile. Hopefully Ashley recognizes that you did it on purpose and never answers your calls again.", "YTA", "NTA. Your friend doesn\u2019t get it. Doesn\u2019t care to get it. And is a selfish brat.

My best friend can\u2019t have kids and I would NEVER use that against her.

She should have said something earlier, but I'd be backing out too if I felt unwell", "I agree a million % with what you said.\n\nA ex friend of mine threw the fact that I can't have kids in my face, let's just say every single friend she knew blocked her and told her to fuck off.", "Agree. Waiting 30 minutes before she was suppose to be there was bad because she could've easily contacted her friend and let her know that she wasn't feeling well and was going to wait and see how she felt before deciding not to go rather than blindsiding the friend. \n\nThe friend sucks because she's holding a promise that was made when they were younger over OPs head even though life has changed and was more annoyed than concerned about OP but then OP threw the fact that her friend can't have children in her face. \n\nOP you need to give your friend time to cool down and then prepare to apologize a lot and don't use excuses when doing so.", "I think saying  \"Well if you had kids\" to anyone, whether they want kids or not, is an AH move. I often say, I don't hate kids, I hate parents, and this is one of the reasons why. For too many people having kids becomes an excuse to never put effort into anything outside of their own family units.

Grow up.", "Your situation ***would have been*** understandable if you called in the morning many hours before.  \n\nYou didn't.

You crossed a line you can't backtrack on.", "Technically ESH but you're cutting yourself a lot of slack. \n\nNot only has she clearly put in a ton of effort on your birthdays, but did it ever occur to you that your best friend has supported you through THREE pregnancies while struggling with her own infertility? Did she come to all your baby showers? Did she hang out with you during your pregnancies? Did she listen to you while you complained about the pregnancies? Did she visit you when you have the babies? Did she come to the kids' birthdays and other events?   \nAnd what she expected in return was for you to make the effort to show up for her birthday. Obviously if you're unwell, you're unwell, and she reacted poorly, but could I posit that perhaps she was upset because you also *didn't understand her situation*? I mean, it kind of feels like you didn't even try here. You called her at the last possible minute, and I'm assuming here that your general absence didn't fuck up established plans like a dinner reservation. You didn't make any attempt to offer a consolation like leaving early or coming later in the day, or making it up to her later. \n\nConsidering your husband's reaction here, I wouldn't be surprised if he had convinced you at other points to deprioritize your plans with her for him or your kids. All she wanted was to be important to you for one day in the year, and whether for good reason or not, you couldn't do that. But what's worse, is that you put an expectation on her of reacting in a perfectly composed way to your actions while putting no such expectation on yourself. You didn't treat her as an equal, and my guess is this isn't the first time. And clearly, you don't see her as an equal in some capacity, because you don't see people without children as equal to people with children. You don't see them as legitimately busy, or legitimately stressed, or see their priorities as legitimate. This is a really shitty thing some people with kids do. This is offensive to people who CHOOSE to be childfree. It is unbelievably cruel to say that to a person who is UNABLE to have children.  \n\nHer side of the street here is fairly negligible. She got upset with you and called you fat and lazy for cancelling on her party and maybe has some slightly unreasonable expectations (but ones she holds herself accountable to as well). Your side of the street is: canceling last minute even though you knew you probably weren't going to make it, not taking greater care to try and retain your energy levels so you could go, not allowing her feelings of hurt, not considering her priorities legitimate, and then being intentionally hurtful about something she feels incredible pain over. If I were you and I cared about this friendship, I would apologize for all of that and if I got an apology back about her thing, I would consider myself lucky.", "She did not deserve and your husband is an AH to say that.\n\nMakes sense why you are together then.", "She did not deserve it.  You and your husband both sound like terrible people.\n\nHer first response was concern for you.  But your reason was that you were too tired? Seriously.  Too tired to put in the bare minimum effort? And then you attacked her in the most vile way.  I\u2019m guessing that friendship is over.", "I have a feeling this is not the first time you have bailed on her last minute and blamed it on your pregnancy from 4 months ago (or any of your past pregnancies/kids).

As someone who has it, I often wait until the last minute to cancel, because it\u2019s very possible I *might* be able to get up enough energy to go. Friends who are friends as long as these two have been should be able to understand and be empathetic to that. The grocery store comment also.

There\u2019s no real excuse for how this friend reacted to a cancellation for what, in the end, is a birthday party. \n\n2. The infertility thing is inexcusable.  The issue of course, is, that if op does have postpartum rage, she really may not be able to control the things that are coming out of her mouth, at least temporarily until she receives meds/therapy. We can say all we want that something isn\u2019t excusable, but it doesn\u2019t change the lived reality of a mental disorder and how that affects brain dysfunction and action/reaction.
