My first 2 pregnancies have gone quite smoothly, with a few bumps on the way but not much problems. My third pregnancy was really tough as I got diagnosed with preeclampsia, put to bedrest for 6 weeks, and had an emergency C-section during which both me and the baby almost died. I stayed in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks before I was deemed healthy enough to be released. \nMy husband has been beside me in the delivery room all 3 times and does most of the chores and takes care of the kids while I recover and makes sure I have everything I need.We have saved more than enough money from both our jobs to have the ability to afford to stay at home for as long as is needed.\nMy best friend (we'll call her Ashley) has been my bff since elementary school. We've never missed each others birthdays no matter what was going on in our lives or how far apart we were. She also was aware of my troubles.\nYesterday was her birthday. In the morning I was feeling below par and I was too tired to get out of bed so my husband took care of all the kids and helped me shower like he did a 100x before during my pregnancies and postpartum. When it was around 2 pm, I was feeling a little better but I was still worn-out so I called Ashley. \nHer birthday party was scheduled at 3pm and I was supposed to arrive at 2:30 pm. I waited until 2pm because I knew how important her birthday is and I was hoping that I would feel good enough to come over. I told her that \"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I won't be able to come to your birthday party because I'm not feeling well.\" She asked what was wrong, and I told her that I was extremely exhausted and there was no way I can be at her party. I literally heard her sigh angrily and she said \"But what about our promise? I broke my arm while racing and still traveled a 1000 miles for your birthday, but you can't drive 20 miles to see me? If your fat ass can reach the grocery store, then you would come here if you actually cared\". That's when I became mad and told her \"Well if you had kids then you would understand \" and that's when she said \"F*ck you\" and hung up. (That wasn't the entire conversation). You might think \"what's so bad about saying if you had kids?\". Ashley can't get pregnant due to an incident that happened during our younger college days and the topic is very sensitive for her, so me saying that was extremely vile. \nThis morning, I woke up feeling much better and I attempted to contact Ashley so I could apologize but she wouldn't pick up and ignored all my text messages. My husband said that I shouldn't apologize because if she was a real friend she would have shown concern and worry instead of anger and the attitude of a brat so she deserved my comeback, but I feel so guilty for bringing up her inability to have kids and I feel like such an asshole for doing so.

Sure, maybe she could've been a little more sympathetic towards you but it's reasonable to have expectations of you if she sacrificed a lot back. This could've been mitigated if you had told her about your exhaustion earlier. Also, you said you were feeling a little better at 2PM and it would be reasonable to believe that you'd continue to feel better once you went to the birthday.", "YTA - either you and your husband are a perfect match due to being so vile, or he\u2019s a bad influence on you. \nIt could also be you\u2019re a bad influence on him.

Waiting until the last minute regardless of your reasoning was rude and extremely disrespectful of her time.\n\n..why the FUCK would you say that to someone who wants kids and can't have them? That's beyond careless or thoughtless. That was outright cruel. She's supposed to be your best friend and you dug at her in such a painful way.\n\nPutting your kids and family first is natural. Longstanding friendships don't always survive the life changes. That's okay. What's not okay, and something I've seen before, is suddenly disregarding your existing friends' feelings entirely once you have kids.

Stop complaining. Be a better friend.", "YTA. I had a traumatic twin birth and emergency c-section and almost died. And you know what? I\u2019m still not an a-h to my friends.

You threw her infertility back in her face.", "Oooo this hit me some kind of way.\n\nI have had trouble conceiving. So I am very sensitive to your former BFF. She reacted to you canceling 30 minutes to Splashdown. Let's remove the reasons. She got angry that you canceled 1/2 hour BEFORE YOU WERE TO ARRIVE ON HER BIRTHDAY. I would be salty too. Had you canceled at 8am, 11am, or even noon that could have given her a little leeway to alter things.\n\nYou said something completely unforgivable in my mind. And I cut my BFF out for texting me at my rehearsal dinner \"Sorry. I'm not coming.\" Girl... I hope you make friends easily because she's gone for good. And I hope you are speaking to your doctor if 4 months postpartum is still requiring assistance for you.\n\nYTA", "YTH, but for your pregnancy comment not bailing on the party. That was cruel, but you already acknowledged that. Give it some time and reach out again to apologize. \n\nShe was also cruel with that grocery store comment. That comment seems out of place, but I dont know your history or friendship. She sounds selfish with the way she reacted. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou went for the lowest possible blow you had.  Yuck.\n\nFrankly, a grade school promise to always be there for each other's birthdays is ridiculous.  Life happens.  That she refuses to understand that - especially having full knowledge of how difficult your pregnancy and birth were - tells me that, emotionally, she's still stuck in grade school.  She's not some kind of hero for traveling 1000 miles with a broken arm.\n\nFocus on your new baby and leave Ashley alone for a while.", "YTA.

Personally, I don't get why she wasn't more understanding of your condition. Just my opinion.", "I'm going against the grain and going to say NTA for everything but your last comment to your friend about her infertility. I will also say that you and your friend have been friends for a long time now...this is something that could be easily worked out with apologies (from both of you to one another) and an actual conversation about what happened. I can understand calling out at the last minute as well with wanting to be completely sure before bailing on your best friend's birthday party. She should have accepted it with a bit more grace like she could've said oh I'm sorry you're feeling that way, I'm a bit disappointed because we had made a promise. Instead she blew up at you and hurled a promise in your face that was made years ago before life happened. However, I am noticing strong signs of PPD in your behavior. \n\nPPD is not something to be taken lightly. Ive had depression all my life but when I had PPD that was probably the worst bout of depression I've ever gotten in my life. It took years for me to recover and that was with ONE pregnancy with relatively little complications. I can't imagine how it must've been for you, OP, with such a traumatic birth then having to take care of two LOs on top of that. I'm glad your husband is there for you but YOU need to get help ASAP for that-not just for you, your husband, and your children but for the people involved in your life as well. \n\nI will also say for other Redditors-her ppd is not an excuse for her behavior. If she continued like this and refuses to get help then that's on her all the way. Additionally, if your advice to OP is to not have any more kids, that's unrealistic. Either way it's done, she already has three whole kids, and her life has been changed forever. \n\nOP, a conversation needs to be had with your friend. We all make mistakes, we're only human. But if you value your friend and everyone else around you your PPD has to be addressed. I wish the best of luck to you.", "I\u2019m honestly super confused. Why is your husband helping you shower 4 months after you delivered a baby? And doing everything for you and the kids?

The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "ESH she was being a brat but you really went for the jugular", "ESH. Her comments were emotionally manipulative and yours were mean.

Honestly, she should never speak to you again.", "I\u2019m going with ESH and a *mild* YTA. She showed very entitled behavior after a very traumatic situation that you experienced. Being your friend for so long, you would think she\u2019d show some compassion/empathy, but your comment was way below the belt. *However*, due to the traumatic pregnancy and birth process, and all of the post party hormones *and* feeling not up to par, it isn\u2019t unlikely that you didn\u2019t even think about what you were saying in the moment and were operating off emotions. Now that doesn\u2019t excuse what you said, but it does explain it. With all of that being said, it\u2019s likely your friendship is over, so I wouldn\u2019t expect her to answer any of your calls or accept your apology.", "ESH.", "NTA she took the situation from 0 to 100 and you matched her speed.

I can\u2019t believe she compared breaking her arm to almost dying. She broke her arm.

C section recovery is no joke and friend should have been understanding. \n\nIMO you had complete control of the moral high ground until you brought up her infertility. \n\nPost partum life is absolutely incomprehensible to those who haven't been through it, ESPECIALLY for C-section moms. Everything you did is forgiveable, right up until you said what you said. \n\nApologize for your words but stand by your decisions.", "NTA.  Friends since elementary school, but she can't accept that you've just been through absolute hell (and nearly stayed there!), and your body's just not up to travelling yet?  That you only waited until the last minute because you kept trying to be okay enough to keep your promise, and did everything in your power to make it happen, shows you did your best.  Travelling with a broken arm is not the same.  Not even in the same ballpark, and she's an incredibly entitled brat for even thinking it might be.\n\nPre-eclampsia kills.  And a C-section is a major surgical procedure that requires months to *properly* recover from.  Your husband gets it, why can't your best friend?  I agree, mentioning her inability to have children was a nasty little dig, but I'm willing to bet that she took a dig or three at you that wasn't mentioned, as well, which made you feel you had no choice but to dig back.  Even in this day and age, pregnancy and childbirth take a huge toll on a woman's physical, mental, and emotional health, and not every woman has a \"perfect\" pregnancy or experiences an easy birth.  It's okay to feel bad about snapping in anger or out of exhaustion, but your friend needs to grow up and learn compassion.", "NTA. Your friend extremely overreacted about your cancellation and knew what you were going through.  It just didn't seem to matter since it's her birthday party.  She was unnecessarily mean first.  You shouldn't have gone there, but she shouldn't be pressuring you and calling you fat a$s.  What kind of friend is that?  I can see why you snapped.  Apologize for that part, but not the whole thing.  If you weren't feeling well, she's not owed an apology.

I can't imagine ever saying this to one of my closest friends who can't have kids and desperately wants them. She's 100% auntie and I involve her in everything I can because she loves this stuff. Now that being said. You need to talk to your doctor about PPD PPA and post partum rage. So many people on here are just saying your hiding your last pregnancy as an excuse for being mean but it really sounds like your last pregnancy ha thrown you for a loop physically, emotionally, and hormonally. Your not using your child as your excuse. Giving birth has completely fucked up your system for the time being. Your doctor and a therapist can help. However don't present that as an excuse in your apology. Simply state that your story you brought this big insecurity into this picture. You understand that she might want to go no contact with your for a while. Your sorry to have pushed that etc. You're looking into getting help for the physical and mental issues your suffering from, and your sorry you took some of that out on her. Leave it as a voice message if she won't answer or as a text message and let her reach out when she is ready. You hurt her deeply and she's likely going to need time and space to heal. Let her have that.", "How long are you going to blame your pregnancy on everything?

I genuinely believe OP has postpartum rage which is a symptom of trauma during birth and stuff. Yes, she could've told her friend sooner, I can totally understand why the friend would be angry about that, but her anger with it turning into her insulting her was alot different. To me it genuinely does sound like the friend has some resentment that OP can have kids and she can't. The friend being mad and frustrated, ok. The friend insulting the way OP looks because she's mad, not okay. They grey area, which really makes it ESH, is what OP said. Me personally, when I'm in that much pain and you're treating me like I absolutely betrayed you and insulting me like that, In the moment I would've said it too.

For your comment that you knew was wrong. For doing so 30 minutes beforehand though your explanation for so is understandable it was still not the right corse of action. Your friend is also an a. She was hurtful all because you were missing her birthday? Like she\u2019s turning 36 come on and you\u2019ve been to every birthday since you\u2019ve known her. She responded emotionally and bratty. You both could\u2019ve celebrated her birthday privately together. She called you fat and provoked you, which I\u2019m sure is a sensitive subject for you after having 3 babies, in which you responded with the infertile comment. What you said is still wrong but it sounds like she provoked it and was hurtful about something you told her you feel in confidence. The other comments suggest that \u201c you\u2019re one of those moms \u201c I say they\u2019re also being overly emotional and I\u2019m sorry if reading through these comments make you feel terrible. I\u2019d just like to tell you that it\u2019s perfectly fine to cancel because you feel too exhausted. You just went about it the wrong way and also terrible things were said. The cancelling is not the asshole part nor is prioritizing your health needs so that you can return to your 100%, for yourself, your family, your husband, and then your friends and in that order.

No, you started it by waiting until half an hour before you were supposed to be there to tell her you weren\u2019t coming.

Of course you shouldn't have said what you did, but Ashley shouldn't have responded in anger to a friend who is struggling. I understand the lashing out because I did the same thing a few times during my recovery. Pregnancy hormones already mess up our ability to regulate our emotions but adding a near-death experience along with the uncertainty during recovery is a recipe for volatility. Be gentle with yourself, focus on your recovery, and immerse yourself in the joy of the newest life your body gave its all to create. Give Ashley time to cool down. If you guys have been friends for that long, she'll likely want to talk at some point. Use this time to get your head in a healthier place so you can respond appropriately when she does. Good luck to you, OP. It really does get easier with time and the trauma will stop sitting in the forefront of your mind.", "NTA.

That is not how life works. \n\nI understand waiting to call off in hopes that you feel better, but she didn\u2019t even let you explain. All the people saying you should have sucked it up and went anyways are unrealistic. If you had gone and not been as chipper do you think this friend wouldn\u2019t have taken that just as personally?

Ashley is acting like it\u2019s her 16th birthday, not 36th. \n\nEven if Ashley didn\u2019t have kids by choice, it\u2019s an extremely condescending attitude to tell someone they don\u2019t get it because they don\u2019t have kids.

You purposely wanted to hurt her. You comment was meant to hurt her to her souls and well pregnancy has made me mean is your excuse. It\u2019s all cool.

Waiting 30 minutes before she was suppose to be there was bad because she could've easily contacted her friend and let her know that she wasn't feeling well and was going to wait and see how she felt before deciding not to go rather than blindsiding the friend. \n\nThe friend sucks because she's holding a promise that was made when they were younger over OPs head even though life has changed and was more annoyed than concerned about OP but then OP threw the fact that her friend can't have children in her face. \n\nOP you need to give your friend time to cool down and then prepare to apologize a lot and don't use excuses when doing so.", "I think saying  \"Well if you had kids\" to anyone, whether they want kids or not, is an AH move. I often say, I don't hate kids, I hate parents, and this is one of the reasons why. For too many people having kids becomes an excuse to never put effort into anything outside of their own family units.

Did she come to all your baby showers? Did she hang out with you during your pregnancies? Did she listen to you while you complained about the pregnancies? Did she visit you when you have the babies? Did she come to the kids' birthdays and other events?   \nAnd what she expected in return was for you to make the effort to show up for her birthday. Obviously if you're unwell, you're unwell, and she reacted poorly, but could I posit that perhaps she was upset because you also *didn't understand her situation*? I mean, it kind of feels like you didn't even try here. You called her at the last possible minute, and I'm assuming here that your general absence didn't fuck up established plans like a dinner reservation. You didn't make any attempt to offer a consolation like leaving early or coming later in the day, or making it up to her later. \n\nConsidering your husband's reaction here, I wouldn't be surprised if he had convinced you at other points to deprioritize your plans with her for him or your kids. All she wanted was to be important to you for one day in the year, and whether for good reason or not, you couldn't do that. But what's worse, is that you put an expectation on her of reacting in a perfectly composed way to your actions while putting no such expectation on yourself. You didn't treat her as an equal, and my guess is this isn't the first time. And clearly, you don't see her as an equal in some capacity, because you don't see people without children as equal to people with children. You don't see them as legitimately busy, or legitimately stressed, or see their priorities as legitimate. This is a really shitty thing some people with kids do. This is offensive to people who CHOOSE to be childfree. It is unbelievably cruel to say that to a person who is UNABLE to have children.  \n\nHer side of the street here is fairly negligible. She got upset with you and called you fat and lazy for cancelling on her party and maybe has some slightly unreasonable expectations (but ones she holds herself accountable to as well). Your side of the street is: canceling last minute even though you knew you probably weren't going to make it, not taking greater care to try and retain your energy levels so you could go, not allowing her feelings of hurt, not considering her priorities legitimate, and then being intentionally hurtful about something she feels incredible pain over. If I were you and I cared about this friendship, I would apologize for all of that and if I got an apology back about her thing, I would consider myself lucky.", "She did not deserve and your husband is an AH to say that.\n\nMakes sense why you are together then.", "She did not deserve it.  You and your husband both sound like terrible people.\n\nHer first response was concern for you.  But your reason was that you were too tired? Seriously.  Too tired to put in the bare minimum effort?

Add to this a lack of empathy in modern society for the hardships of parenting, and I think it\u2019s all just a cluster fuck. \n\nMy personal vote is ESH. OP\u2019s statement was more vile, but the fact that friend couldn\u2019t be empathetic still puts her in the \u201cshe sucks, op just sucks more\u201d category. And if this isn\u2019t OP\u2019s normal behavior, she really does need to seek out a medical professional because the loss of a friendship over changed brain chemistry without medical help is heartbreaking, even if it is her fault.", "Yeah, I think ESH is right. I also wonder, though, if this really is outside of OP\u2019s normal personality given that her friend has cut off all contact. Maybe it\u2019s the last straw. I guess I find it weird that OP is introspective enough to post in here, but isn\u2019t enough to realize she might have PPD if that\u2019s an issue. But maybe?", "I didn't even take it as hey I am throwing her infertility in her face I just thought she was careless in saying that her pregnancy and being a mother has been hard on her and someone who isn't going through it will not understand.", "As someone who has both battled infertility and had an extreme preterm c-section delivery (along with a uterine rupture later on).  I see you being tired and really trying to hold off, hoping you can make it.   I was with you as a the situation sucks up until the \u201cif you had kids\u201d comment.   That made you a MAJOR AH.   \nYou should apologize profusely, but she deserves a better friend.", "Omg these comments are pissing me right the fuck off, holy fuck. I don't know when people became so unyieldingly heartless, but we should all be concerned about it. Anyway, NTA. Yeah, you did say something vile and I don't particularly like it, but she fucking deserved it. You went above and beyond. I didn't almost die from childbirth, but I did almost die from something else. It's been two years and I'm STILL trying to recover. It's extremely hard work to get better, to come back from being so far gone. It sucks, and it really doesn't feel good. But you don't need to have experienced it yourself to have a little goddamn empathy, which your \"friend\" clearly doesn't have, at least not for this. She's well within her rights to feel hurt that you couldn't make it, but the difference between a child and a grown ass adult is how we handle negative feelings. Your friend handled it like a child, not an adult. Your friend knows you and baby almost died, she knows you're still recovering, I mean, your husband helps you shower for fucks sake, and her entitled ass expects you to operate a vehicle? That's incredibly dangerous when you're not feeling up to it, so that's a complete disregard for your safety in favor of a birthday meal you could make up for.  My bf has to help me shower too sometimes, and on those days he has me give him my keys because I SHOULDNT BE OPERATING A DANGEROUS WEAPON IF I CANT EVEN WASH MYSELF. Like what the fuck would she have done had she successfully guilted you into driving there, and you got in an accident? Guilted you for being dead or in hospital instead of at her yearly party? Then, she immediately calls you fat. Now Idk if that's a sensitive topic for you, but it's also extremely uncalled for, especially considering she was asking you to still go to her party. Idk about anyone else, but I don't insult people in the same breath I'm asking them for something. It's just bad form. Trashy tbh. Was what you said also uncalled for? Yeah, I mean kinda, but humans are imperfect and it's absolutely absurd that all these strangers in the comments are shitting on you for reaching a breaking point and making a mistake you REGRET (key word). You know what your friend is lacking in this whole ass situation? Regret. Remorse. Guilt. We have you TRYING to make contact and apologize, and her sitting on her ass acting a victim. Where's the, \"Yeah what you said was fucked, but I was being completely unreasonable.\" Also, it's not like you said it in a way where she's lesser than you, you simply said she can't understand, which is true. It still wasn't the best thing to say obviously but it could have been much worse, much more cruel and intentional. Sounds to me like you were at your wit's end and your mouth spoke before your brain caught up. It happens. Sometimes it sucks ass like this, but it happens. These people shitting on you are acting like they've never made a bad mistake in their lives. It's your friend's prerogative to block you and never speak to you again, but it's also yours to realize that she was toxic. Normally I'm not comfortable making that judgement based off one post, but your husband's reaction to your reaction sounds like he's been sick of her for awhile, so I'm a bit more confident in that.", "NTA she was inconsiderate of your condition, therefore it only made sense to throw her infertility in her face!

Do you even realize all of the hardships that your friend has to go through knowing she can have her own children? The struggle of tell any guys (assuming she is into guys) here are guys that will drop a girl if they can't have kids. There will always be people who ask when are you having kids. There is the self blame and other people that will blame her. honestly it is almost a metal health issue all on its own. \n3. This was not some sort of family emergency or emergency of any kind!

It took me 6 weeks to recover.\n\nIt sounds like OP is probably suffering from postpartum depression. That is the only thing that would be affecting her recovery at 16 weeks postpartum. Our bodies won't feel normal for years, or ever again perhaps. I am still numb at my c-section site. But there is a huge difference between being able to carry on with life and social plans and returning to our pre-pregnancy state of being. \n\nOP is not wrong for prioritizing herself above a birthday party, but she went about it so wrong and badly and hurt someone in the process, and she was cruel in reaction to her friend's disappointment. Her being 16 weeks postpartum is no excuse for this. OP is the AH.", "Some people have had carried 2 pregnancies in 2 years.  Not sure where you heard it takes 2 years to recover but that is ridiculous.", "No one was expecting her to drink and dance, cancelling was rude but maybe forgivable, but then what OP decided to say makes it all go off the rails.", "Sometimes birthdays were the only times we felt loved or special in our childhoods and they become very special. I bet the friend makes a big deal of others\u2019 birthdays as well. People should make as big a deal of their birthdays as they want!!! Life can be short. Only bothers me if they don\u2019t then offer the same to others", "Yeah the deal they made when they were younger does seem unworkable because stuff like this happens but I understand friend being annoyed by the change in longstanding plans", "I think this is absolutely an ESH story. Ashley handled OP announcing she wasn't coming terribly, but I feel like OP responded with a disproportionate nuke to their relationship. Maybe it's time they both move on, I don't know.", "That's the problem here, though; we don't know how much (or how *well)* they communicated. If OP has been basically acting like things are okay, maybe just tired, and then cancelled at the last minute, then it's YTA. If the friend knew that she was bedridden and that it would be a really big deal, then less so. OP probably should have warned her in advance that it might happen (but she will try), but that happens sometimes when you're sick. Either way, there's no excuse for how much it escalated. \n\nI'd also say that how often they flake plays a part in how bad an AH she is. If she's never flaked, except maybe for seriously extenuating circumstances, then the friend should know how bad it has to get for that to happen. If flaking is more common, then she should already be trying harder to communicate.", "I can't help but wonder - she says Ashley knew, is there a chance that OP has spent all their conversations talking about her difficult pregnancy etc? The vibe I get is that Ashley has finally had it with what she feels like is a one sided friendship.", "I wish we knew how OP postured Ashley possibly missing her birthday with the broken arm. Has it been a \u201cbroken arms race\u201d all along?!", "Ok?  Something is still wrong and she needs to see a fricken professional.", "Still shouldn't be healed 4 moths later.  I wonder if it's more mental than physical at this point.", "Cause sometimes you wake up feeling like hell warmed over, and a few hours later you don't. That's not to say you feel BETTER, per se, just not quite on the verge of death anymore. The thing about that specifically is that when you feel like utter doodoo then suddenly feel less shit enough to think properly, it's like an adrenaline rush. You still feel bad, but also like you can do anything... Or at least make a short drive to eat a meal. It's super common, so I wonder if OP suspected that could happen. Personally, I still would've sent a text saying I was really not feeling well but I'd let her know closer to the meeting time for sure because I really want to make it if I can, so I do think that was a mistake but a mistake that I can totally understand cause sometimes your brain just doesn't work as efficiently when you don't feel well.", "I had a very similar story. Third pregnancy. Two weeks in hospital. Both almost died. Lots of blood transfusions. Caught a staph infection at the hospital and had to get the wound repacked constantly. And even I\u2019m skeptical of 16 weeks. I also believe it was phrased as 16 weeks instead of 3.75 months because weeks makes it sound like a smaller amount of time and that she has a newborn rather than a four month old.", "yep 4 months is lots of time to heal.", "They aren't rent saying it's in her head, or she should be better, they are saying there's something OP.hadnt figured out is wrong yet.\nThis isn't normal, even for the situation she described. And she may not know to complain enough to get the attention she needs.", "I totally agree, it\u2019s life changing in more ways than one. The comment I replied to said she might not be ~~recovered~~ healed from the surgery, which would be really concerning. Congratulations and I hope you and your family are doing well!\n\nedit: word and formatting", "I\u2019ve had 2 emergency c-sections. You shouldn\u2019t still be healing (as in serious pain) 16 weeks after unless something is seriously wrong. If she\u2019s still in serious pain by then she needs to see a doctor asap.", "I did know that, I literally watched it all happen the last time I scrubbed in for a c-section. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but if she hasn\u2019t recovered from a surgery that should take 6-8 weeks to heal from in 16 weeks (that\u2019s FOUR MONTHS, more than double the expected time) then there\u2019s something seriously wrong.", "Yes, I've had one too but four months on, you should be almost back to normal. If not, you should be getting medical help.", "Ah yes, we can all count on our resident pain expert, Major_employ, to gauge whether a stranger you've never met is suffering or not. \ud83d\ude44 Be for real man.", "I also had thyroid issues after birth, I'm sorry you have had to suffer like that too. Throughout my entire pregnancy, I suffered from Hyperemesis gravidarum. I had lost so much weight by the end of it, I looked gaunt. But after birth, with how much extra I had to eat for breastfeeding... I ballooned up 80lbs in a disgustingly short time. It ended up being hypothyroidism.", "Chronic fatigue is a thing.\nAlso post parfum depression", "I totally agree. I just think people are going after OP for the wrong reasons. What she said to her friend in response was absolutely gross and shouldn\u2019t have been said.", "I've been in that position before and I still fully communicate \" I don't feel like I am getting anything out of this, based on this and this and this. It's causing me stress and for mental health purposes I'm taking a step back.\"\n\nNot \" if your fatass can get up and drive somewhere you should have come here\" or whatever.\n\nBoth sound immature, but Ashley is kind of a dickhead over all. She had the context. She chose to lash out instead.\n\nOPS response was also rude.\n\nESH", "Well she was waving some \"weapons in the form of words\" so you might be right", "It doesn\u2019t matter. If my friend just almost died giving birth and still is feeling shitty, I would *never* call her a ***fatass*** for not coming.", "If they have never missed each other birthdays, since they have known each other. When OP had canceled. She should\u2019ve known it was something serious. She could simply going through Post partum depression. And then to call her a fat ass could of literally been her 13th reason why. Fuck that she deserve that comment. Like you don\u2019t get be grossly mean, hurt somebody feelings. And not expect a rebuttal.", "Call a woman that delivered a baby, and almost died, a fatass.\n\nLet me know how that goes.", "She didn\u2019t cancel the party, she\u2019s just not coming. Shit happens a friend was a huge asshole first.", "she didn't ask for anything handed to her, she just didn't attend a birthday party for a full grown adult.", "Yes people with chronic health issues have been living it up for far too long! /s", "Do women think doctors care about womens concerns? Most don\u2019t. What a shit show this is. Women hating women.", "> Personally, I still would've sent a text saying I was really not feeling well but I'd let her know closer to the meeting time for sure because I really want to make it if I can\n\nYes, because that's the polite thing to do. And yeah, it's a mistake and mistakes are understandable. You know what else is understandable? Someone getting upset because your mistake fucked up their plans.", "My c section healing took almost 6 months. Nothing wanted to heal in a timely manner and there were points I couldn\u2019t even stand up without help. It depends on the person", "Yeah for some reason 16 weeks sounds way less than 4 months lol It\u2019s weird how stuff can trick our brains. Like $1.99 sounds way cheaper than $2", "All this presumption and judgment! Yup, comment section is TA for this one", "Get back to me when you\u2019ve gone through the same thing.  Or better yet, when you get your medical degree and license to practice.", "I think we should also consider the impact of mental healing with healing.  \n\nShe may be physically recovered. However, given that she and her baby nearly died,  it wouldn't be surprising if she was suffering from post trauma symptoms (if not PTSD), or other postpartum MH dx.\n\n  These could all cause exhaustion, depending on the person and the situation.", "Read the age though, OP is 35. My stepmom had 3 C-sections. One when she was 20, one when she was 22, and the last one when she was 35. Guess which one was the worst and took the longest for her to recover? She was basically bed-ridden for 6 months and my dad did everything for her, when he was at work I helped her when I could come over. She had the same issue as OP, preeclampsia and her and my half brother almost died on the table. 4 months is nothing when your body doesn't heal as fast as it used to. Especially after two previous kids.", "That is the recommended heal time. That's when you are well enough to go back to work. That doesn't mean you are magical healed and back to normal pre-pregnancy.", "Which just means it's bigger than \"I just had a baby\". \nAnd her doctor needs to hear about it more clearly.\n\nYou know why they haven't?\nBecause people minimize it and say \"oh, everyone feels like that.\"", "You\u2019re literally what\u2019s wrong with your entire profession. Recommended heal time is just an estimate and plenty of women need longer to recover. But you don\u2019t believe this woman about her own experience or her own body. Thank god you\u2019re in surgery and mostly deal w unconscious patients I\u2019m sure your bedside manner is awful \n\n(And yes OP is still the asshole but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying about her health)", "...in your professional experience to date.\n\nWestern medicine is A LOT  less concrete that we are lead to believe.\n\nDocs/Surgeons are glorified and cheerleaded into thinking they are the smartest most capable human in the room.\n\nI've had the rare a special luck of having conditions no one on the medical team had seen is all of their education, training and careers.\n\nBottom line. None of us are OP.\n\nNone of us are in her 4 month/16 week post partem body.\n\n& if any of the medical folks chiming in are men - no matter how much you learn you have never lived in our female bodies (just like I've never lived in a male body).\n\nWhen you've lived it - great. Even then we are all having our own experiences.\n\nThe concept of normal parameters of things is broadly over generalized.\n\nLet's trust a believe people when they tell us they feel the need to shelter in self care.", "Your body is not back to normal after 4 month. Even if you didn't feel completely awful any more, it takes as long to recover from an easy pregnancy as it takes to go through the pregnancy (so 9 months to a year). She didn't say she was rolling around on the floor in agony, she said she was feeling exhausted. Can you honestly say that 4 months after giving birth you never had a single day where you were completely burned out and struggled to function? Because I pretty much felt that way all the time after both births. I was stilling doing 2am feedings for Christ's sake! I was sleep deprived and could barely feed myself some days. And that's normal! Nobody should expect the mother of a baby under 1 to be able and willing to attend a party of any kind.", "Yup! People keep saying 4mos is more than enough time to heal. One of my friends had an emergency c-section and it took like, 7mos to fully heal.", "nah im good like 5 comments already saying the same from obgyn an 1 surgeon saying the same so maybe you should just read or google.", "Yup. The older we get the longer it takes to heal. Scratches that used to heal in days when I was in my 20s take up to 2 weeks now. As we age our ability to heal just slows down. I can see a surgery that takes weeks in your 20s taking months in your 30s and 40s. And if op lost more blood than usual that would lengthen the healing time, too.", "Nah that's BS. My mates fiance's cousin had a CS and was fine 6 weeks later. As a medical expert, I think your step Mum is just lazy /s", "I just want to give the other side of that - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily an age thing. I was 39, had a c-section with twins and was recovered in about 2 weeks \n\nBy the time they were 8 weeks old, I was back at work.", "Your stepmom may have been suffering from PPD. I had an urgent c-section in the middle of a hemorrhage\u2014my 4th hemorrhage over 2 months of bed rest. I was 31; it was my second c-section in 10.5 months; and it took me about 2 weeks to feel okay again. \n\nAt 4 months or 6 months, there\u2019s something way beyond physical going on.", "You\u2019re making a bunch of assumptions here but that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t believe that OP is recovering in her own way, what I am saying is that if she has not *physically healed from surgery* she should be seeking medical attention. If she has not *physically healed* there may be an underlying reason. \n\nNormalising prolonged complications following a CS is the type of misinformation that would cause women to minimise their symptoms and delay seeking help.", "These men are proving that no one gives a shit about women's medical issues.", "These men think breaking a bone is comparable to traumatic child birth lol"]}
