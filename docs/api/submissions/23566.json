{"id": 23566, "submission_id": "15ei2eb", "title": "AITA for cancelling on my 35f best friend's 36f birthday party at the last minute?", "selftext": "I 35f have 2 children (5m and 3f) and a baby who is only 16 weeks old. My first 2 pregnancies have gone quite smoothly, with a few bumps on the way but not much problems. My third pregnancy was really tough as I got diagnosed with preeclampsia, put to bedrest for 6 weeks, and had an emergency C-section during which both me and the baby almost died. I stayed in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks before I was deemed healthy enough to be released. \nMy husband has been beside me in the delivery room all 3 times and does most of the chores and takes care of the kids while I recover and makes sure I have everything I need.We have saved more than enough money from both our jobs to have the ability to afford to stay at home for as long as is needed.\nMy best friend (we'll call her Ashley) has been my bff since elementary school. We've never missed each others birthdays no matter what was going on in our lives or how far apart we were. She also was aware of my troubles.\nYesterday was her birthday. In the morning I was feeling below par and I was too tired to get out of bed so my husband took care of all the kids and helped me shower like he did a 100x before during my pregnancies and postpartum. When it was around 2 pm, I was feeling a little better but I was still worn-out so I called Ashley. \nHer birthday party was scheduled at 3pm and I was supposed to arrive at 2:30 pm. I waited until 2pm because I knew how important her birthday is and I was hoping that I would feel good enough to come over. I told her that \"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I won't be able to come to your birthday party because I'm not feeling well.\" She asked what was wrong, and I told her that I was extremely exhausted and there was no way I can be at her party. I literally heard her sigh angrily and she said \"But what about our promise? I broke my arm while racing and still traveled a 1000 miles for your birthday, but you can't drive 20 miles to see me? If your fat ass can reach the grocery store, then you would come here if you actually cared\". That's when I became mad and told her \"Well if you had kids then you would understand \" and that's when she said \"F*ck you\" and hung up. (That wasn't the entire conversation). You might think \"what's so bad about saying if you had kids?\". Ashley can't get pregnant due to an incident that happened during our younger college days and the topic is very sensitive for her, so me saying that was extremely vile. \nThis morning, I woke up feeling much better and I attempted to contact Ashley so I could apologize but she wouldn't pick up and ignored all my text messages. My husband said that I shouldn't apologize because if she was a real friend she would have shown concern and worry instead of anger and the attitude of a brat so she deserved my comeback, but I feel so guilty for bringing up her inability to have kids and I feel like such an asshole for doing so.

Use any excuse you want - you are still going to know you are a nasty piece of business who deliberately hurt someone you supposedly care about. I wouldn't take your calls either.

I get you\u2019re tired, but it\u2019s only a few hours once a year to get your ass up and spend time with your friend on her birthday or you should have offer an alternative of her going to see you tomorrow and just sit in your house having some cake or something. If she\u2019s travelled 1000 miles with a broken arm then you gotta put in the same effort. You also should have called her as soon as you thought you couldn\u2019t make it so she could prepare herself even if it\u2019s just a warning of I\u2019ll see how I feel at 2pm. She sucks for calling you a fat ass but making fun of the fact she can never have kids is worse and you did it because you wanted to cut her deep", "ESH. It sucks when lives change and friendships have to change too, but neither one of you handled this well.\n\nBy the way, it's pretty much always a dick move to say \"If you had kids you'd understand.\"", "NTA. She's your best friend and is aware of your current health situation. This isn't just your health, but that or your unborn child... whatever her unhealed beef with you having children is, she should care enough about you to realize the gravity of overdoing it during a hard pregnancy.\n\nYou are an AH for that remark knowing she can't have kids. You're NTA for missing her birthday to be safe rather than sorry. Not one of my friends would have missed an opportunity to say \"Please take care of yourself first\" in the same situation. Sometimes friendships are habit instead of healthy.", "ESH\n\nYou for shooting her with the 'if you had kids' spear.\n\nHer for throwing the 'fat ass' rock at you.\n\nHowever, you have been friends for a very long time. This will blow over. Since she isnt answering your texts, I would write her a note and apologize for your comment (you dont have to get into anything else, just a paragraph about how it was a mean thing to say and that you are sorry). Then give her space. If you havent heard from her in a couple weeks, reach out by text again and invite her to coffee.\n\nI went through a similar thing with my childhood best friend. It took 2 years but we are now back as strong as ever.", "ESH kind of a dick move to throw her infertility back in her face", "A kind friend would have reached out to you that morning, to see if you were going to be well enough to attend. \n\nA kind friend wouldn\u2019t lash out at you for missing the party. \n\nA kind friend would think your well-being is more important than an artificial tradition. \n\nShe wounded you deeply by being so unkind, when you needed understanding. She made a conscious choice about her behavior, and you were unbelievably wounded.  Only then did you lash out. You deserve som grace here because you were provoked while ill. \n\nThe birthdays are the only big thing holding you two together. Your friend is infertile. You have babies and associated health problems. This has already caused you two friends to drift apart.  \n\nYour lashing out about her infertility may end the friendship. If that\u2019s what happens, it\u2019s ok.  Your comment was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. The break may have been inevitable. \n\nNTA", "You both suck, end of story.", "ESH. You should have reached out prior to to let her know where your health was heading instead of backing out an hour prior. She should be a better, more understanding friend and you absolutely suck for the children comment.", "She was mean. Your were below vile. I\u2019d never speak to you again. Lifetime of friendship doesn\u2019t give you the right to do that. I cannot imagine the pain my friend who cannot have kids goes through. I don\u2019t care how ugly she was to me? I\u2019d never ever use that as a weapon. \nYTA", "ESH \n\nYou could have phrased it better, say \"I had my abdomen sliced open, youbhave no idea what it's like\". Because the situation had nothing to do with *having kids*, it had everything to do with the process of *giving birth*. \n\nOn the other hand, birthdays are not a big deal. Primarily school promise is not a pact with the devil, it's not like you can't bail out if something important comes up. And knowing how you were doing she should have assumed it was more likely you wouldn't be able to make her birthday than that you would. But then again, you could have told her earlier, not 30 minutes before. \n\nSo yeah, ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sure why. Give her a heads up in the morning not 30 minutes before you were supposed to show.\n\nShe overreacted and was incredibly disrespectful. Calling you fat was not ok and makes her an automatic AH.\n\nYou then took it to 1000% and escalated it further, using language you knew would hurt her, on purpose. You can't say \"Well if you had kids\" to someone who wants kids but can't have them.

You don't fucking do that.\n\nYour husband sucks for telling you not to apologise, what you said was awful.

But what you did was bloody awful so be prepared to grovel.", "You literally almost died. You had surgery. You're still recovering. How in any way is that comparable to having a broken arm? It's not. Yeah, it might make things inconvenient or difficult for a while with a broken arm, but you literally had your lower abdomen sliced open. That's not something to sneeze at, and I commend you for being able to endure something as traumatic as that.\n\nYour friend understands your situation, but still expects you to show up to a party and gets angry and calls you a fat ass and then tries to guilt trip you? That's waaaaay out of line. I was on your side entirely OP right up until you made that low blow about her not having kids when YOU KNEW how much of a sore spot that was for her. I understand your anger, but that was an entirely unecessary jab and stooped even lower than your friend.\n\nSo, OP, you're not an asshole for calling out of your friends party, but you are an asshole for your comment.

Yeah, she could have been more understanding but she was pissed because you cancelled SO last minute.

She was being an AH about not understanding your current medical needs, but she didn't deserve your comment and you should apologize if she gives you the chance.

There is nothing more annoying than people who think being a parent is an excuse for everything, particularly being an AH.", "Maybe stop having kids and you won\u2019t be so irritated and short tempered? This is one of the annoying things about some moms y\u2019all seem to think the world revolves around you and your immediate family. Maybe your friend thought that four months was plenty of time for you to heal and granted she would be wrong because it depends on the person, but you seriously went for the lowest blow you had. She should have been more understanding and you should have expressed your anger with different words. Your husband sounds toxic af as well because it\u2019s crazy that he doesn\u2019t believe that you should try to work this out with a friend that you\u2019ve had since high school. I\u2019 gonna say he\u2019s probably jealous of the friendship or he just doesn\u2019t like her. If I were her I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be able to forgive you because I would always wonder if you actually believed you were better than me because you have kids. All of you kinda suck, but if we\u2019re measuring you\u2019re the bigger AH.", "YTA for blaming everything on your \"last pregancy\" (your child is almost 4 months old).  You could have reminded your friend that your attendance at the party was iffy and at least sent flowers or something; it appears that you made almost no effort for her birthday.  Is she correct that you've been to the grocery store recently?  If so, you probably could have planned better to ensure that you had enough energy to go to her party. Calling 1/2 hour before you were supposed to arrive is pretty thoughtless, especially as it seems she was counting on you to help with setting up before 3:00.  Then, instead of being sincerely apologetic & acknowledging that you hurt her feelings, you hurled what is probably the most sensitive & painful issue of her life right in her face.  Really the only thing you can do now is write Ashley a letter expressing your regret and owning up to what an awful thing you said, then hope she is willing to forgive you.  I wouldn't.", "Arguably, she could have been a bit more understanding, but you could have been too. Cancelling at the 11th hour and a pretty disgusting jab at her wasn't called for.", "She should just say 4 months like a normal person", "She did not deserve to have her infertility thrown in her face. You cancelled on her half an hour before you were supposed to be there. A little more heads up would have been helpful.", "Gross. Her deserving it is not one of the options on the table. We can debate whether you\u2019re an asshole (you are) for saying it or not, but she didn\u2019t deserve it regardless. Your husband is awful.", "What you said was unforgivable", "She was being unreasonable for sure. \n\nBut like Michelle Obama, aim to go high when people go low.", "Your husband is a horrifically awful person", "Then your husband is an ass.
