We all start but then I felt Emma's foot on mine.she tells me to help her. I hesitate but then I told myself that its one question so I will help my friend. This went on for almost the whole year.\nFastforward to this year, We had an exam week for the\n2nd semester. she told me\"if I get a low grade, my parents won't let me go on vacation this summer so I'm counting on you, okay ?\" I told her I would \"help her\"\nI felt that foot on mine again. She was asking for answers. I tell her idk and I haven't written anything yet.we had 2 hours to complete the test so I was mentally preparing all the answers in my head. I wait until we have 10mins left and i just go at it. she whispers \"Show me fast, we don't have much time left\" I tell her to wait for me to finish, then i show her my paper. As soon as she starts writing we hear \"time's up\" she was crying so I comforted her saying I'll be faster next time, but i would do the same. After, I would make her believe that I didn't do good and I wouldn't get good marks.she was shocked when we got our exams back and I had the highest marks. She was angry because she failed most of those exams and said I tricked her. I told her I was fed up with her taking me for granted and thinking I would always be at her beck and call.\n\nIn the end I was again top of my class and as for her, she did  pass,but barely. We still talk here and there but she told all of our of class that I am a horrible person and that I'm the reason she won't be traveling this summer. I might be the Asshole since I could have told her straight up that I wouldn't help her but idk.

She wanted me to help her in real time on quizzes and i said absolutely fucking not.  i mean, i said it in a way that made her still marry me years later, but i worked hard and she was out at frat parties while I worked hard, so i didnt feel bad if she didnt know the material and i wasnt about to do the work for her.", "NTA that vacation was expressed to her as a privilege that depended on her grade. If she really wanted it she would\u2019ve studied and prepared instead of cheating. She\u2019s gonna be angry and ignorant because she\u2019s a child but it doesn\u2019t mean you should feel any guilt. This is just a lesson for her that \u201ccheaters never prosper\u201d", "NTA. She wasn't asking for \"help\". She was using you to cheat on her exams. You're not the reason she can't travel, you're the reason she passed at all.\n\nShe was never your friend. She could've gotten you in big trouble if you had been caught giving her the answers. She never cared about you, just what she could get from you.", "ESH. The way to handle this is was have a conversation outside of class about how you didn\u2019t want to help her cheat anymore but offer to help her study or let her study with you if she wanted. If she\u2019d react badly to that she was never a true friend worth keeping in the first place.", "ESH - You a lot less. I understand that you were new and trying to make friends, but you risked your own grades (by getting caught cheating) to help someone who really was never your friend. You should have asked the teacher to move your seat. As for Emma, she needs to learn not to skate through life and use people.", "NTA You didn\u2019t trick her, you were done with he BS. If she wanted to go on vacation then she should have studied so she could pass the test herself. I don\u2019t know if anyone else knows she was cheating off you but if she calls you horrible I front of others let her know you just didn\u2019t want to help her cheat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Should have addressed it with her the first time.", "Sorry - going to buck the trend here.  YTA.\n\nI can't do N T A because you were helping her cheat - there's almost never a good justification for that.  And bear in mind you've been helping her cheat for a whole year.  So I can't do N T A.\n\nI'd have gone E S H if you had *both* been complicit in the cheating right up to the end.  In my book, that makes you as bad as her, & E S H.\n\nBut ultimately, it's got to be YTA because you didn't tell your friend you weren't going to help them any more.  Instead of telling her you've had enough, you dump her in it at the last minute.  You know what the stakes are for her and at the worst possible moment for her, you back out.  Now it is absolutely right not to help your friend cheat, but it's the **unkindness** of letting her down without warning that makes you TA.", "NTA! If you had got caught cheating you both would\u2019ve been in trouble up to and including expulsion.", "NTA. She should have studied. Her grades aren't your priority.", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like a friend op", "NTA. Cheating is different than helping. I think maybe you guys should have had a conversation about ways you can truly help her, but you are NTA.", "YTA and so is Emma. I hope you both get caught and fail your next class.", "I say YTA but only because you literally let her cheat for a year, then decided nope. You should have told her from the first, outside of class. She\u2019s one too though!"]}
