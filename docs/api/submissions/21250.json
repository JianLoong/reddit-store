This went on for almost the whole year.\nFastforward to this year, We had an exam week for the\n2nd semester. she told me\"if I get a low grade, my parents won't let me go on vacation this summer so I'm counting on you, okay ?\" I told her I would \"help her\"\nI felt that foot on mine again. She was asking for answers. I tell her idk and I haven't written anything yet.we had 2 hours to complete the test so I was mentally preparing all the answers in my head. I wait until we have 10mins left and i just go at it. she whispers \"Show me fast, we don't have much time left\" I tell her to wait for me to finish, then i show her my paper. As soon as she starts writing we hear \"time's up\" she was crying so I comforted her saying I'll be faster next time, but i would do the same. After, I would make her believe that I didn't do good and I wouldn't get good marks.she was shocked when we got our exams back and I had the highest marks. She was angry because she failed most of those exams and said I tricked her. I told her I was fed up with her taking me for granted and thinking I would always be at her beck and call.\n\nIn the end I was again top of my class and as for her, she did  pass,but barely. We still talk here and there but she told all of our of class that I am a horrible person and that I'm the reason she won't be traveling this summer.

She wanted me to help her in real time on quizzes and i said absolutely fucking not.  i mean, i said it in a way that made her still marry me years later, but i worked hard and she was out at frat parties while I worked hard, so i didnt feel bad if she didnt know the material and i wasnt about to do the work for her.", "NTA that vacation was expressed to her as a privilege that depended on her grade. If she really wanted it she would\u2019ve studied and prepared instead of cheating. She\u2019s gonna be angry and ignorant because she\u2019s a child but it doesn\u2019t mean you should feel any guilt. This is just a lesson for her that \u201ccheaters never prosper\u201d", "NTA. She wasn't asking for \"help\". She was using you to cheat on her exams. You're not the reason she can't travel, you're the reason she passed at all.\n\nShe was never your friend. She could've gotten you in big trouble if you had been caught giving her the answers. She never cared about you, just what she could get from you.", "ESH. The way to handle this is was have a conversation outside of class about how you didn\u2019t want to help her cheat anymore but offer to help her study or let her study with you if she wanted. If she\u2019d react badly to that she was never a true friend worth keeping in the first place.", "ESH - You a lot less. I understand that you were new and trying to make friends, but you risked your own grades (by getting caught cheating) to help someone who really was never your friend. You should have asked the teacher to move your seat. As for Emma, she needs to learn not to skate through life and use people.", "NTA You didn\u2019t trick her, you were done with he BS. If she wanted to go on vacation then she should have studied so she could pass the test herself. I don\u2019t know if anyone else knows she was cheating off you but if she calls you horrible I front of others let her know you just didn\u2019t want to help her cheat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Should have addressed it with her the first time.", "Sorry - going to buck the trend here.  YTA.\n\nI can't do N T A because you were helping her cheat - there's almost never a good justification for that.  And bear in mind you've been helping her cheat for a whole year.  So I can't do N T A.\n\nI'd have gone E S H if you had *both* been complicit in the cheating right up to the end.  In my book, that makes you as bad as her, & E S H.\n\nBut ultimately, it's got to be YTA because you didn't tell your friend you weren't going to help them any more.  Instead of telling her you've had enough, you dump her in it at the last minute.  You know what the stakes are for her and at the worst possible moment for her, you back out.  Now it is absolutely right not to help your friend cheat, but it's the **unkindness** of letting her down without warning that makes you TA.", "NTA! If you had got caught cheating you both would\u2019ve been in trouble up to and including expulsion.", "NTA. She should have studied. Her grades aren't your priority.", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like a friend op", "NTA. Cheating is different than helping. I think maybe you guys should have had a conversation about ways you can truly help her, but you are NTA.", "YTA and so is Emma. I hope you both get caught and fail your next class.", "I say YTA but only because you literally let her cheat for a year, then decided nope. You should have told her from the first, outside of class. She\u2019s one too though!", "INFO: If you got caught \u201chelping\u201d her do you know what would happen?", "ESH. just tell her you won\u2019t help next time.", "NTA.  She pressured you into letting her cheat when you were at a vulnerable position at a new school. I was a new kid at that age and remember what that was like. Having a conversation with her after becoming uncomfortable with her cheating could have caused discomfort and anxiety so I\u2019d understand not telling her. The best thing would have been to tell her that you didn\u2019t want to risk the fallout of getting caught, but tried to include her in your prep for the quizzes or offered to help some other way, but nobody is expected to do the best each and every time.", "Emma isn\u2019t your friend. She is using you as a doormat. NTA, and stop helping her cheat. YOU could get in serious trouble for that.", "NTA.\n\nWhat can she say?  \"OP wouldn't let me cheat off her exams\"??", "You did not \u201cmake\u201d her fail her exams.\n\nShe did.\n\nIf you were caught helping her cheat, you could face suspension/expulsion.\n\nYou are not TA.\n\nFor your own sake, move on from her. You can be kind. But her actions are literally affecting the rest of your life.", "ESH. She was cheating because you were helping her cheat: as far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re both cheaters.", "ESH.  You changed the terms of your nefarious agreement with her and didn't tell her.  I hate cheating (I teach at a college) and I understand being frustrated, but you didn't give her any indication that you would stop aiding her in getting unearned grades.  (That's not HELPING her, by the way.  In the long run, it's hurting her).  Withdrawing your answers abruptly without letting her know is an odd move and not a friendly one.\n\nLike most AITA, this would've gone much better if you'd had a conversation.  As you are 15, you have an opportunity to learn from it and start using your words.  If someone is taking advantage of you, don't go along with it until you blow up seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nI'd have different--and harsher--words for your friend, but you're the one who wrote in.", "ESH - you helped her cheat for a long time (meaning your complicit, or an accessory) and she used you to cheat. You also outright agreed to help and then changed that at the last moment knowing you\u2019d screw her over\u2026.and then lied about it by saying you\u2019d go faster next time. \n\nSo you cheated and then also screwed your friend over because you were upset. You both suck.", "NTA She needs to do her own work. She is taking advantage of you.", "ESH. You should not put your grades at risk to help or pretend to help her. You could get suspended or even expelled. Next time just say no. It's not worth it.\n\nShe sucks for being a cheater.", "Telling her she would help, and then also lying after she didn\u2019t and saying \u201cshe\u2019d go faster next time\u201d is tricking her. They both suck", "It\u2019s also important to remember that in university (at least most universities) the academic integrity policy will condemn both the cheater and the person who helped them cheat. You can be kicked out of a university for sharing your work with friends. I know of a case where someone at my university shared his work with a friend just to help the friend, and without him knowing his friend just copied all his answers. They were both expelled. **don\u2019t help your friends cheat**", "YTA for being a part of any of this deception.  The 'only friend' situation will get better in college.  High school sucks. College is chill.", "NTA, tell her to study next time. Don't help her cheat anymore either. Study with her if she wants, but that's it.", "Both AH. grow uo", "NTA this time but you were for the other time. If the two of you were caught you both could be expelled.", "ESH.\n\nHer for cheating and you for going along with her cheating.\n\nThis is not a friendship that should continue.", "All you had to do was tell her you weren\u2019t helping her anymore.", "You did not make her fail.  She didn't do the work.  It is her responsibility to put some effort into the class.  She wanted to cheat her way through.  She may have had to take the next level of the subject and been lost because she didn't learn anything this year.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You were getting used.", "Agreed except for one thing.  OP should\u2019ve told a teacher what was going on.  Academic integrity is extremely important and a violation like this can cause serious problems.\n\nMy vote is ESH.", "thiiiisssss. right here. OP YTA and its because of this exactly. what you did was lash out at someone you considered a friend when something large was at steak for them. this sort of thing is handled best with humility. the best course of action imo would have been to talk to her about how you're uncomfortable with cheating, but offer to help tutor her if you want to help without cheating. help her write a set of notes that will help her specifically. there are plenty of positive ways to work through struggle, communication and patience being incredibly important.", "Next time just tell the person they can get good grades if they study.", "It's cheating even if you are helping someone cheat. So you can end up with cheating on your record and you wouldn't get into any university. Do you even understand that? You can get high grades but still completely fail to get anywhere because you are cheating. In university, if you help others cheat, you can get kicked out.\n\nI'm saying this because you should have said no to help cheating from the first time. Yeah, you are 15, but too naive to think this person was your friend. Obviously, she became your \"friend\" after you allowed her to cheat.\n\nYou are not responsible that she is missing summer vacation. Her parents were rewarding her for doing well in class = studying, not for cheating and getting a good grade.\n\nI'd say ESH.  You because you should have never let her cheat and you are putting yourself at risk. She is an AH because she thinks she can get cheat to get what she wants.", "NTA. Used you then made you feel bad about it. This person isn't your friend.", "ESH. I can\u2019t say N T A because you literally helped her cheat and that\u2019s a big asshole move.", "I don't think OP is the AH in that she should have told the \"friend\" because it's obvious this person only became a \"friend\" after OP allowed her to cheat. They barely knew each other before. So OP doesn't owe anything to the person who weaseled herself into pretending to be a friend just to cheat.", "If this was one instance then you would not be the jerk. But this went on for so long, ESH. You both could\u2019ve lost more than just her losing a vacation.", "I work in a university, and this is exactly how it works.", "Back in high school history was my favourite subject and I would give answer to classmates who sat by me.  But weeks before final exams I told them to study because I wasn\u2019t risking getting taught helping them.  They didn\u2019t believe me\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">you considered a friend\n\nThat's the thing, she was not OP's friend, just a cheatsheet. Unless OP clarifies that the 'friend' truly feels the same way I view the friend as a 'friend'.\n\n>this sort of thing is handled best with humility\n\nWhy does OP have to be the one with humility? This is a lot of pressure on kid, OP can't say no cuz she'll lose a 'friend'. The girl didn't ask for help. Just to cheat off of her. So OP has to be big one and push help? The kid didn't ask for help at all. They asked, to cheat. Dot. OP isn't responsible for her friend.\n\nSure talking this away would have been nice but it's 1001% unreasonable imo to blame OP for not 'communicating'. NTA.\n\nBut for OP's sake never help anyone cheat again cause that shit gets you kicked out of uni fast, just as cheating yourself."]}
