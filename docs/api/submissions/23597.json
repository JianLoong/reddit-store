So I (22M) have been with my gf (21F) for about 2 years, I'd say everything about us is great, we have so much in common, as well as we are each other's best friends. An aspect of myself is I don't do well with banter, I don't like to be made fun of at the expense of everyone else's humour, my gf understands this but sometimes she forgets and gets a little testy, so yesterday we had friends over and played some games. I decided to whip some pasta up in the kitchen and serve it out to everyone else. The girls were playing games in the living room and one of my gf's friends goes: Is there anything your man can't do, she just says make me finish. The table of girls erupts in laughter, and I feel embarrassed. \n\nIn the quickness of the moment, I go yeah same, she stops laughing and through giggles goes: You don't have to be mad I was just playing. I tell her that I am being serious, at this point, her face begins to change, and she says I have, I ask her have you ever seen it or have I told you, when she comes to that realization, she goes red and just leaves the living room. There is silence for a while till one of the girls calls me rude, and how I pretty much just told all her friends she's bad in bed, I try to defend myself by saying she started it but no one wants to hear it. When everyone left I tried to talk to her but she ignored me and went to sleep.\n\nI don't think what I did was necessarily wrong, considering she started it trying to embarrass me so AITA", "created_utc": 1690821585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15el4zq/aita_for_embarrassing_my_gf_in_front_of_her/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I play around a lot. My partner does the same with me. We like to pick on each other. If we're not doing that most likely we're fighting.\n\nIt'd never cross my mind to say something like what she said. If you had just said \"same\" and when she said \"I'm joking\" you said \"same\" than I'd be going with n t a. But you took it a step further and that's why I say ESH", "ESH\n\nYikes.

So don't give to much for what THEY say.", "NTA, she started it and by saying you don\u2019t have to be mad I was just playing, she\u2019s carrying it on more, there\u2019s no scenario where you don\u2019t look like the fool, she made you the fool so you just returned the favour. She deserved it by making a joke like that when you were just complimented.", "Woah - you are not \u2018embarrassed\u2019 or in the \u2018doghouse\u2019 - you are pretty much over since you two just went nuclear on your relationship in front of witnesses. ESH", "NTA. Giving people the taste of their own medicine is absolutely a good move. Your gf knew you don\u2019t want to be made fun of, yet she crossed the line and later was mad at you for doing the same!", "ESH. Bringing up anything that happens in the bedroom between you two should be off-limits. She did it first, but that doesn't make it any better that you did the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nIf you can't take it, don't serve it...", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA. Her \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t funny. You literally just turned it back on her.", "NTA and she needs to be more mature. She can dish it out but not take it? That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019d try to talk it out first but honestly if she\u2019s that immature about this, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be way more immature about more important matters", "NTA.  She tried to unman in front of her hens and you didn't play along. Oh well.  Get someone who actually likes you next time.", "ESH. Good lord y\u2019all are about half a second away from boomer type \u201cball and chain\u201d jokes", "ESH.", "ESH. Play stupid games, when stupid prizes. \n\nShe wanted to embarrass and belittle you (emotional/psychological abuse) in front of her friends and excuse it as a joke.  She and her friends are mad because you struck back hard and turned the tables on her.  I can understand why you did it. \n\nIf what you said was true, you should have talked to her about it sooner.  If what you said wasn't true, then you probably went too far.", "ESH.  If you aren\u2019t laughing too then the other person is just being an AH, not teasing you. And that goes for both of you in this case. To make it worse, you each attacked the other using most people\u2019s greatest insecurity, their performance in bed.  Apologize to each other and start communicating when you are both vertical AND horizontal.", "ESH you were both rude and over the top", "ESH What she said was not necessary, and it wasn't \"banter\". It was really rude, and your response to her was even ruder and really shitty.", "ESH, she should know better than to tease over something that personal, and you should've not been a petty child swinging back twice as hard\n\nYou're slightly worse in this situation and should probably toughen up because holy shit if you were a gf I'd be done", "Info- How do you as a man, fake an orgasm?", "I would sit down with her and tell her how it made you feel after she crossed a boundary that you established and I would also apologize for taking your response too far.", "ESH, I think what she said was not okay and she embarrassed you, especially because you told her you don\u2019t like to be made fun of.

ESH.", "ESH. \n\nYou did push it further than she did, partly because she kept replying, too. It wasn\u2019t needed once you made the first response. \n\nShe is a major AH. You\u2019ve told her that you\u2019re sensitive to being the butt of a joke, and that\u2019s a sensitive one. You can\u2019t control her or keep her from joking like that - and she probably does it when you\u2019re not there; you just happened to hear it this time. If she keeps doing this, even in front of you, despite reminders (and she reacts sharply to reminders), it\u2019s probably not worth staying in the relationship. She\u2019s not listening to you on something of real emotional importance. \n\nTo people who say that what she said was intended as a joke, it doesn\u2019t matter.

Grow up you two.", "ESH, She shouldn't have taken the banter into that territory but you are at fault more here. It is reasonable to feel hurt by the statement but it is not reasonable to air our relationship problems in front of others. You should have talked to her privately after and explained that to you it was an unacceptable comment and that comments like these need to stop because you are not willing to put up with them any longer. It needs to be clear to her that this is serious for you.", "YTA. She was making a joke, which probably wasn't meant to be taken seriously, and you got butt hurt about it. Either lighten up, or at least talk to your gf about it afterwards. You didn't have to ruin the whole night for everyone.", "ESH. Grow up.", "YTA. When she said it everyone knew it was just a joke, no one thought she was serious because no one that\u2019s in a healthy relationship like you said you guys are in would expose their intimate stuff in front of people. Except you did. That\u2019s what makes you the AH. She made a joke and you don\u2019t appreciate them and that\u2019s valid but you could have said something to attack her respect of boundaries not literally expose her.", "ESH\n\nit\u2019s not funny nor is it a joke ESPECIALLY to be discussing ur partner IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE TO YOUURR FRIENDS. like she started it and hit a nerve, but you ended it idk.", "Yes, YTA. You being embarrassed doesn't justify your response.", "YTA\n\nAlthough it is somewhat tempting to say E S H as she did start it by doing something she knows you don't like, your response was wildly out of proportion. Her comment was quite clearly a joke, and none of her friends thought she was being serious, while yours was either actually serious, or was a lie that you made up and doubled down on to convince her friends she sucks in bed, either of which is fucked up to say in front of them.", "YTA\n\nINFO: Do you even like your GF? What were you trying to accomplish by seriously, intentionally, and maliciously attacking her in from of her friends? Why were you set on intentionally hurting your GF? Did you even care about your GF a little bit when saying all of this? \n\nYou got your feelings hurt over essentially a \"that what she said joke\". So you intentionally attack your gf and double down letting everyone present that you mean every word you said. Honestly I would be surprised if you still have a gf. I would never stay with someone who personally attacks me and tells a room full of people that I can satisfy them.", "My guy it was just a joke and not a terribly offensive one at 22 years old. In fact, I think it was kinda funny. Even if it's not funny its obviously not true and no one would take it as anything other than harmless banter. Then you escalated that shit 10x. I'd prepare to be single. YTA", "ESH. If you've talked to her multiple times about how you don't like being made fun of for other people's laughs, and she says something very personal like this, then she isn't paying enough mind to not make you upset. However, this doesn't make it okay for you to act similarly.", "ESH\n\nThis is not banter.\n\nYour girlfriends comment was too far. Some things are private unless BOTH parties are comfortable sharing it out, and clearly you are not. \n\nI don\u2019t fault you for chirping her back. But you became a huge AH when you made it serious. Her comment was a joke, albeit at your expense. Yours was a straight up roast", "YTA you took it a little too far when you kept going with what you said. You could have laughed it off and said me too after she looked at you hurt, but by saying you were serious and providing an explanation you are indeed TA", "depends is it true?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Women also don\u2019t ejaculate as obviously as men (nothing sprays out, you can say squirting exists but I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s not just pee but anyways).
