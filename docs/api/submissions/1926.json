Married for 5 years.\n\nMy (31F) husband (35M) has a bad habit of leaving his clothes in the dryer for days and days. When he does his laundry, he will wash and dry his clothes and then use the dryer like it\u2019s a drawer full of clothes (meaning that he dresses himself with clothes out of the dryer because they never get put away). We both work full time and we split the daily chores, but I do take on almost all of the weekly/monthly \u201cmaintenance\u201d household chores like washing the bed sheets, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, cleaning the microwave, etc.\n\nMy problem is that when it comes time to do my laundry, I have to fold and put away his clothes because they are always in the dryer. He uses triple the amount of clothing that I use on a weekly basis so this takes a very long time compared to my own laundry. I have NEVER been able to do a load of laundry in the course of our marriage without having to remove his clothes from the dryer. I have never been able to wash the towels or bed sheets without having to remove his clothes from the dryer first.\n\nHe simply does not agree with me that he needs to put his clothes away drying them, which honestly is fine with me. I don\u2019t care if he puts them away or not, but I would like to be able to complete *my* chore (my laundry) without having to complete an *additional* chore (his laundry). I have tried everything I can think of to make it easier for him. I have bought extra hampers so he can simply place his clothes into a hamper when the dryer cycle is complete (the hampers end up being filled with dirty clothes while the clean clothes stay in the dryer). I made a folding board to make it easier for him to fold his shirts. If I fold his clothes for him, he will leave them on the table and use the table for his closet (I don\u2019t like going through his drawers to put them away without permission since we already have very little privacy in our small apartment). I have pleaded and begged him to simply remove his clothes from the dryer or set a timer on the Alexa so that I could do it for him.\n\nYesterday, I needed to do laundry and was in a rush so I didn\u2019t check the dryer before washing my clothes. When I went to put my clothes in the dryer, it of course was full of his clothes. I couldn\u2019t find an empty hamper besides mine that I had just emptied which I needed to carry my clothes to the table where I could fold them. I got fed up and took his clothes and dumped them on the (clean) floor, which was the only area in our apartment where I could feasibly place an entire load of clothes.\n\nHe came home from work and was upset when he saw his clothes on the floor. He doesn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t just fold them or put them in a hamper like I normally would. I explained that I simply didn\u2019t have the time to clean up after him in the midst of everything else going on.\n\nSo Reddit, I need your judgement.
