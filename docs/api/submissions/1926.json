Married for 5 years.\n\nMy (31F) husband (35M) has a bad habit of leaving his clothes in the dryer for days and days. When he does his laundry, he will wash and dry his clothes and then use the dryer like it\u2019s a drawer full of clothes (meaning that he dresses himself with clothes out of the dryer because they never get put away). We both work full time and we split the daily chores, but I do take on almost all of the weekly/monthly \u201cmaintenance\u201d household chores like washing the bed sheets, sweeping/vacuuming the floors, cleaning the microwave, etc.\n\nMy problem is that when it comes time to do my laundry, I have to fold and put away his clothes because they are always in the dryer. He uses triple the amount of clothing that I use on a weekly basis so this takes a very long time compared to my own laundry. I have NEVER been able to do a load of laundry in the course of our marriage without having to remove his clothes from the dryer. I have never been able to wash the towels or bed sheets without having to remove his clothes from the dryer first.\n\nHe simply does not agree with me that he needs to put his clothes away drying them, which honestly is fine with me. I don\u2019t care if he puts them away or not, but I would like to be able to complete *my* chore (my laundry) without having to complete an *additional* chore (his laundry). I have tried everything I can think of to make it easier for him. I have bought extra hampers so he can simply place his clothes into a hamper when the dryer cycle is complete (the hampers end up being filled with dirty clothes while the clean clothes stay in the dryer). I made a folding board to make it easier for him to fold his shirts. If I fold his clothes for him, he will leave them on the table and use the table for his closet (I don\u2019t like going through his drawers to put them away without permission since we already have very little privacy in our small apartment). I have pleaded and begged him to simply remove his clothes from the dryer or set a timer on the Alexa so that I could do it for him.\n\nYesterday, I needed to do laundry and was in a rush so I didn\u2019t check the dryer before washing my clothes. When I went to put my clothes in the dryer, it of course was full of his clothes. I couldn\u2019t find an empty hamper besides mine that I had just emptied which I needed to carry my clothes to the table where I could fold them. I got fed up and took his clothes and dumped them on the (clean) floor, which was the only area in our apartment where I could feasibly place an entire load of clothes.\n\nHe came home from work and was upset when he saw his clothes on the floor. He doesn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t just fold them or put them in a hamper like I normally would. I explained that I simply didn\u2019t have the time to clean up after him in the midst of everything else going on.\n\nSo Reddit, I need your judgement.

It's a great post. Even after 48 years of marriage, we're still learning things.", "Plus he helps with the \"daily\" and not the deep clean chores. She does the weekly/monthly chores she mentioned. Changing the sheets, vacuuming, etc. It's a lot. The bare MINIMUM is he can throw his laundry pile somewhere else.", "Put the basket up in the crawl space. :)", "Are grown men supposed to be this helpless? OP already went way above and beyond in making it easier for the husband. I'm not OP and I want to effing strangle the guy. Why didn't she fold the laundry????? FFS what an absolute clown", "Why should she have to live with her husband\u2019s clothes across her bed and sofa? Why should she cover the entire table with his clothes when we already know he isn\u2019t going to put them away, and now she won\u2019t have a place to fold her laundry?", "He would probably just push them to her side", "I can tell you why I do this, I have adhd so sometimes I just get completely off task, out of sight out of mind.

Lol\n\nI still have depression and chronic illnesses but i at least remember to put away the clothes in the dryer now.", "I just... don't care? I don't own any clothes that will wrinkle. I generally dump them into a hamper that I leave next to the dryer, because it's easier to sort through them for what I'm looking for, but folding and putting clothes into drawers is a lot of work for literally no value unless it's something that I'm not going to wear again that same week. \n\nOf course, I don't have a partner I'm inconveniencing. \n\nOP, you're NTA. But part of the problem is that you care way too much about how laundry \"should\" be done. Why have you ever folded his clothes for him instead of just dumping them into an empty hamper or onto the table, like you would a stranger's clothes at a laundromat? If all of the hampers are full of dirty clothing, why didn't you just dump those onto the floor first? If he didn't want his dirty clothes on the floor at that point, he'd learn to leave one empty. \n\nYour husband is 100% the AH because he clearly doesn't care that *you* care about this, and he can't even be bothered to dump his own clothes into an empty hamper for you even if he doesn't want to put them away. That he expects and has ever expected you to fold for him is appalling. But if he isn't otherwise disrespectful and you can learn to let go a little, it might make your life a lot less frustrating.", "ESH, really? there was nowhere else you could put them? You didn\u2019t even need to fold them but just taking someone\u2019s clothes out and throwing them on the floor is an AH move.", "NTA, sounds like weaponized incompetence on his part.", "No you're not. But keep trying. He needs to learn. \nJust reading this I can hear my mom: \"GET YOUR F'ING CLOTHES OUT OF THE DRYER!!!!\"", "NTA.  Never fold his clothes again.", "NTA.  When I left my ex, I was seriously ill and thought I might not make it.  I realized I didn\u2019t want to be with him because of things very similar to this (and more\u2026but a lot of passive aggressive laziness and bullshit).   He would never put away his laundry or even do it himself.  He would sneak his laundry in with mine and then get mad if I didn\u2019t fold and put his stuff away too because I was \u201cdoing it anyway\u201d.  When I left to live with my parents, he was literally buying underwear, socks and undershirts because as a grown ass man of 32 years old, he wouldn\u2019t clean and put away his own laundry.  It\u2019s not even weaponized incompetence, because you know he knows how to do it.  It\u2019s pure laziness and disrespect for you and your time.\n\nETA: I forgot my favorite story about my ex not putting away his clothes.  He accidentally locked the cat in the laundry room one evening (cat was sneaky and ex was supposed to make sure he was in the main house every night, because I was went to bed first most times.) and the cat used his clean clothes as a litter box.   I expressed that if my ex had put his clean work clothes away like a normal person, he would have clean work clothes to wear.  It was the most beautiful karma for both not checking for sneaky cat and also not putting his shit away.", "NTA and you do it every time. Even if the floor isn\u2019t clean. Actually especially if the floor isn\u2019t clean", "Pretty much. Because OP tried a myriad of other solutions and his response was \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just do it?\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to change or adjust; he wants OP to \u201cjust do it.\u201d NTA", "My bf and I have a similar problem but I hate hate hate folding laundry so I\u2019m content to live out of laundry baskets my bf he prefers his clothes folded a specific way and at a specific time otherwise they don\u2019t get put away. Needless to say I still do the laundry but I live out of my basket of laundry and then 1 for his clean clothes he has to fold now and 1 for dirty clothes. Is it perfect nope but a relationship is about compromise and this was ours to avoid a weekly fight. Doesn\u2019t help with my job now I wear like 4 outfits for a week cause I wash my work clothes daily cause they are putrid\ud83e\udd22.", "That's what I did and in his gaming chair and his TV chair.... I also put them in his car in the driver seat. He eventually got the point lol.", "I wouldn't bother carrying them to the bedroom. Just stick them in one of the other hampers. Who cares if it already has clothes in them or if those clothes are clean or not.", "Yep.  This is why I have five clothes baskets.  You have to choose the hill you want to die on.", "This is a really sweet and astute comment.", "NTA\n\nI would have been screaming at him that I wasn't his fucking servant but that's just me.", "You realise he leaves the clothes in the dryer because he doesn't want to do the part that comes AFTER taking the clothes out of the dryer? The folding and putting away?\n\nYou realise he uses triple the amount of laundry you do because he DOESN'T have to do this part like you do? Or he doesn't want to do this part because he has triple the amount of laundry you do, same difference? \n\nLook, on one hand, NTA. Please keep dumping his clothes on the floor (although I also like the suggestion of hiding them). Also, stop doing almost all of the weekly and monthly chores, that's completely fucked up. Both you and he are treating your time and energy as more disposable than his. Look up weaponised incompetence - it might be on purpose or not on purpose, but it's what he's doing to you. Re-evaluate how much time you spend on chores and how much time he spends on chores and then totally reassign them. And if that doesn't work, go to counselling, because this stuff - being tidy, being organised, doing chores - is actually really hard for some people, and your husband might be one of them. But you're devaluing yourself and your own time and energy by letting him fail out of doing it. \n\nON THE OTHER HAND, it's worth digging a bit deeper on the root cause of the laundry aversion and what will solve it, because trying to get him to do something he's deeply avoidant about will only frustrate you both. Does he use more clothes for a reason? Does he hate putting clothes away for a reason? Does he have enough room in his closet to put his clothes away? Is there a chore he would swap with you (OUT OF YOUR RENEGOTIATED FIFTY PERCENT NOT OUT OUT OF YOUR \"ALMOST ALL\") so that you do the folding and putting away?\n\nPersonally, I despise folding laundry and used to live out of an ever increasing number of laundry baskets. Now I have my closet arranged so that I don't have to fold anything, I just fling clothes into the right section. It's great. It takes two minutes to put clothes away and I can always find what I need now. It might be as simple as something like that.", "NTA. This is deliberate weaponised incompetence on his part. He finally got a proper consequence and doesn\u2019t like it. Keep doing it or he\u2019ll keep trying to wear you down into taking over his chore.

He could put away his clothes, but he quite knowingly chooses to inconvenience you instead. Every. Single. Time.\n\nIt's textbook self absorption, it just doesn't cross his mind to do something he doesn't have to for somebody else's benefit. \n\nI bet this is a pattern, nobody is this casually selfish at just one thing.", "NTA put them on the floor every time. If he doesn't believe his clothes need putting away he has two options\n1. Buy you a separate dryer you can use for your own clothes \n2. Deal with them being on the floot", "NTA, you are his wife, not his mother. \n\nKeep dumping his clothes until he learns that his laziness gets him nowhere. His clothing, his problem!", "You are his wife, not his mommy. NTA", "NTA your not his mother or maid", "NTA, I would have done that *the first time* he left stuff in the dryer.", "NTA! OMG! When I was with my ex I do all the colored, including laundry, even though I got off work later than him. Plus had to pay for that couple extra hours of childcare. I ended up pregamamt with twins and was put on bedrest. He was so pissed he had to do laundry. He would throw it on me trying to get me to do it. Uh no! I was allowed to go to the bathroom and that was it, other than that on my back. \n\nEven though this isn't the same thing for you, its the principal. One person should not be taking care of another's laundry.

For months I begged him to just put his dirty clothes in the hamper, tried every trick in the book so eventually I got fed up and made a rule that anything I found on the floor was garbage.

He got the point real fast.", "There are 6 people living in my house right now. My husband and I do our laundry together, but the kids each do their own. It's quite common to find someone else's stuff in the dryer when you need it. If there's an empty basket handy, we'll put the clothes in it and place that on top of the dryer, outside the laundry room door, just inside the person's room, or pretty much wherever is most convenient for the person who needs the dryer. If there's no basket, the clothes usually end up piled on the ironing board, or sometimes your bed. No one complains.
