I would never complain about my neighbours.", "After a murder in your complex last month?! Certainly NTA.  There's no legal or practical reason why you can't record public area adjacent to your dwelling, from your dwelling (both inside and out).

If I\u2019m outside my apartment I assume I\u2019m being recorded. The only reason to be so butthurt is because she is doing something she doesn\u2019t want recorded . If it was cameras setup at her front door id say maybe TA but most complexes have cameras in any hall and the entrances these days. Id more wonder what she is doing to not want cameras in common areas. Id feel more secure knowing the areas around me are recorded especially after a murder.", "NTA. I wonder if that woman knows there are countless other people with security cameras on their house or business that record her everyday.\n\nShe can rest assured that nobody is gonna be going back through their security footage to watch random people walk by because that shit is boring as hell.", "NTA\n\nI wonder what she\u2019s up to", "NTA. You are just looking out for your safety whilst complying with all laws and regulations.\n\nShe has no right to butt into your business.", "She is probably afraid you are going to record her meeting her drug dealer in the parking lot.

I reallllllly dislike Ring cameras and hate how I am constantly showing up on dozens of ring cameras everyday I stroll outside. If I could make ~75% of them magically disappear, I would.

I might try to have another conversation with her to let her know that you aren't trying to snoop on her and you don't care if she engages in illegal activity.  But someone was just murdered, and you're nervous, and this is simply a security measure, etc.  Take her some cookies or something and tell her you want to be a good neighbor, but you also want to be as safe as possible.\n\nI say this not because you owe it to her but because as much as possible you want to have good relations with your neighbors.  Sometimes a little bribery can help smooth things.  You handled it correctly by checking first with the leasing office and your lease, so you should be legally in the clear, but you never want an enemy next door.", "Tell her tough shit ,she can move if she doesn't like it, NTA", "NTA, people in public don't have an expectation of privacy.

Just saying that the opinion on the matter might differ depending on location.\n\nLegal aspects aside, I would not feel comfortable knowing my neighbor records when I leave the house and come home. Or who I bring with me.", "Good point. If you aimed your camera into her window, or you did it accidentally but refused to fix it, then it would be a problem. That's not this."]}
