We have two daughters. Our youngest is only 2 whereas our oldest, let\u2019s call her Mia recently turned 10. We are in Scotland and Mia is going back to primary school later this month and starting primary 6. Basically, for those not familiar with UK schooling, it\u2019s her second last year of primary school and she will be in high school in 2 years time when she is 12. It\u2019s a similar schooling system to England except kids start school here a year later at 5 rather than 4. \n\nAnyway, Mia was very adamant she wanted a phone for her birthday and Chris and I refused simply because we set a hard rule that she is too young for a phone and won\u2019t be getting one until she starts high school when she\u2019ll actually need it. I need to emphasise that Mia has access to contacting her friends online through us and an iPad with parental controls. For example, she has a few gaming apps that are kid friendly to play with her friends and she frequently FaceTimes them from my phone or Chris\u2019 phone. My point is, we are aware of how and who she contacts and we are always around or monitoring it. The parents of her friends have more or less similar setups as us with their kids generally being supervised and using their phones or whatever. We also limit the time she is on it so she\u2019s not addicted to it. Chris and I are always around supervising or Mia is always supervised and has boundaries so she can have you know a childhood. It will be the exact same with our other daughter when she is Mia\u2019s age and she also won\u2019t be getting a phone until she is 12. I feel like these are reasonable and healthy boundaries for any decent parent to have.\n\nMia kept going on and on about it to our family and I explained as did Chris multiple times that she is not getting a phone and said to our family to please not buy Mia one, no matter how much she begs explaining we have set healthy boundaries and she does not need one. Well, my sister bought one. She handed it to me and told me to surprise Mia with it cos she said \u2018a lot of kids her age have one so she shouldn\u2019t be left out.\u2019 I told my sister I wasn\u2019t accepting it and told her that I asked the family not to get her anything like that and she\u2019s been all bitchy with me ever since.\n\nMy sister says I humiliated her and was rude to not accept such an expensive present. I told her she is undermining what I think is a reasonable boundary as a present and told her I didn\u2019t want anyone buying Mia a phone. I have even told her to return it or keep it for herself as I\u2019m\nNot accepting it. She has been passive aggressive with me since.\n\nMy parents say that my sister doesn\u2019t have children and is the \u2018fun aunt\u2019 and so doesn\u2019t understand parenting boundaries like I do and think I should apologise just so things aren\u2019t awkward. I may be coming across as an arsehole but I don\u2019t see why I should apologise and told my parents as much. Chris thinks my sister crossed a line and thinks I should stick to my principles. My brother who is also childless is in agreement with me and Chris too.\n\nETA: my sister is 23 and our brother is 28.\n\nI also commented this so I\u2019ve copied it here:\n\nShe hasn\u2019t done this before with my daughter regarding expensive gifts bur my sister is 23 and the baby of the family and doesn\u2019t always have a clue about things or some of the things she says sometimes especially since I\u2019m 15 years older than her so our world views are definitely not the same.\n\nShe tries too hard to be their best friend.", "created_utc": 1691074602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h6iib/aita_for_returning_a_birthday_gift_my_sister_got/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is, and your mom is wrong to say she doesn't understand because she has no kids.  I grew up with 4 sisters and I'm the only one who's choosing kid free.  Nobody ever had to explain this to me, but we didn't have parents who would have defended that kind of boundary crossing.\n\nShut this down.  The one mistake you might have made is not being firm enough (aka trying to be too \"nice\").  Sister crossed a line and that should have been the end of it.", "NTA. You and your husband are setting an important boundary for your child. Your sister has no right to interfere with your parenting like this. No need to apologize on your end... its your sister who needs to offer one up.", "NTA. You're the parent, not your sister. She needs to respect the way that you are raising your child. You don't need to apologize at all. You asked her not to do it, and she did it anyway. If anything she should apologize to you for trying to undermine your parenting.", "NTA\n\n>My parents say that my sister doesn\u2019t have children and is the \u2018fun aunt\u2019 and so doesn\u2019t understand parenting boundaries like I do and think I should apologise just so things aren\u2019t awkward.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be a parent to understand that you and your husband get to set the boundaries for your children. That\u2019s a lame excuse.  Love the last part where you are suppose to apologize to basically \u201ckeep the peace\u201d.", "Definitely NTA. 12 years old seems reasonable. It could be a little earlier, or a little later, but it is certainly in the good parenting continuum. Your sister should have respected your wishes, it is actually a little strange she would undermine on this. Does she have an history of doing this? \n\n\nThe only thing I'd say is culture and technology change, so keep an open mind if for some reason it seems a good idea to give one of your kids a phone earlier. What I mean is do not make a principle of the thing, stay flexible, circumstances can change. But as it is, your sister is definitely in the wrong and you don't need to apologize.", "NTA. I just said this in another comment and it widely applies. She doesn't have to understand or agree with your rule for your daughter but she does have to respect it. That's basically it for all friends and relatives of kids (unless there's abuse happening obviously). \n\nAlso, being the \"fun aunt\" doesn't mean you get to stomp all over boundaries set by the parents. That's a good way to become the \"aunt we no longer talk to.\"", "NTA you and your husband set boundaries for your kids that should be respected. Even if you\u2019re sister doesn\u2019t agree with you she has not right to undermine both you and your husband regarding your children.", "NTA. You set boundaries for YOUR daughter and your family should respect them.", "NTA.  You are her parents, after all.  Your sister, fun aunt or not, should know that.  Didn\u2019t see how old your sister was, but I\u2019m guessing in her 20s.  Either way, she knew your wishes and did this anyway.  She should be apologizing to you and Chris.  Good luck with this situation.", "NTA. Your kids, your healthy limits. If you decided the kids won't have a cellphone until 12 but didn't say family shouldn't give one to them, I would see how your sister would get offended.\nBut you set a line and explicitly said no one should buy the kid a cellphone.\n\n\nPlain and simple.", "NTA - I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty as I write this because my sister told me not to get her toddler son an iPad for Christmas and I did it anyway. He loves it, but I can tell that she\u2019s not thrilled about it. You are definitely in the right here. We \u201caunts\u201d need to be better about respecting the parents\u2019 boundaries.", "NTA. You and your husband set a boundary, it was a reasonable one but that is irrelevant. It was a boundary and it wasn\u2019t abusive. Your sister ignored your parenting and you remedied that. No apology required or necessary.", "the \u2018fun aunt\u2019 and so doesn\u2019t understand parenting boundaries like I do \n\nBullshit.   She just ignored your rule about phones \n\nNTA", "NTA Precisely, she's the fun **aunt**, not their parent. This is a parent decision.\n\nShe gets to do things like give them to much sugar or take your daughters out on ridiculous expensive shopping trips or spa days. She gets to give them 100% of the attention when she's with them because she doesn't need to be an adult who needs to clean the house or do something in the garden or the million and one things that parents have to do.\n\nThat's the role of the fun aunt.\n\nNot making parenting decisions.\n\nThis isn't about you being older. This is about her not understanding the meaning of the word \"no\" and her role in your children's lives.", "Nta. Your child. Your rules. Your boundaries.", "NTA. Your kids and your rules. I do want to add how much I hate it when parents tell their kids to apologize for the sake of keeping the peace. Your parents should be telling your sister to apologize as she is the one who had the lapse in judgement.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for. Your parents just want peace. \n\nIf you choose to listen to them, I think that is admirable. If you choose to stand your ground and refuse to apologize, I equally respect that decision as well.", "Definitely NTA, it\u2019s your choice when she gets a phone and 10 is so young. 12 is more reasonable as she\u2019ll be walking to school etc and may need it. \n\nIt\u2019s also not ok of your sister to decide this for you, it\u2019s for you both to get her a phone and commit to the payment of credit or contract whatever it is etc. and not for your sister to decide against you", "I am fun aunt who buys expensive presents for my nieces and nephews (electronics, bikes, fancy shoes, cash for expensive activities etc.) but I always check with parents before buying it to be sure it is ok with their rules.\nNTA", "Question: Why didn't you just thank her for the gift and say you will hold it for Mia until she is of age?", "Honestly OP, I don\u2019t see any bad guys here, you\u2019re setting up clear boundaries and rules for your daughter, which is a good thing, I can kind of understand your sister\u2018s position, she doesn\u2019t have any kids and just wants to treat Mia as a fun aunt, but the only thing I can kind of fault your sister for is just meddling. Other than that your sister sounds like a nice person. All I can say to her is just don\u2019t metal in other peoples business.\n\nOverall, OP NAH.\n\nI\u2019m giving your sister maybe 0.5/5 AH Points,  there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to have a good relationship with your niece or nephew, but the only thing I could say, is just don\u2019t metal in other peoples lives or business, and don\u2019t step all over their boundaries, she could still be a cool aunt while, not stepping on your boundaries.\n\nI\u2019m giving you 0/5 AH Points, you\u2019re just setting up boundaries with your family, which is a good thing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've always understood if the parents say no to things like that then it's a no.  Things like sneaking them extra sweets  or an ice-cream sure but not a phone or expensive item if the parents say no.  It's disrespectful, saying she's the baby and childfree isn't a good explanation/excuse.", "She can be the fun aunt and still respect your boundaries as parents. I only had a flip phone at age 10 with minutes on it (I\u2019m 23 now) because I walked home from school or would have family friends pick me up so I would call/text my parents when I arrived and nothing else. I think it\u2019s completely reasonable to wait until 12 years old. Didn\u2019t get an actual phone I could text or call until 12. She isn\u2019t missing out on anything especially if you guys are letting her have access to your phones and an iPad! Your sister needs to be respectful of you and your partner. That\u2019s ridiculous NTA at all", "NTA, as a fellow childless, considerably younger fun aunt, I would never, ever pull a stunt like this on my sister and go against the boundaries she's set for her children. I adore them, but it's not my role interfering in decisions like this.

She has parental controls on an iPad that is more than fine for her, she can contact her friends and we know who they and their parents are and she also has time limits so she\u2019s not addicted to that. I think that\u2019s perfectly healthy for a kid her age.", "Oh of course we are reasonable but don\u2019t think much will change in 2 years time.

They\u2019ll watch two people pummel one without intervening but if the guy getting pummeled turns the tables 100 people will scream for them to stop and physically intervene.  \n  \nYou can see how we may have developed this trait by looking to troops of primates. An aggressor (often the alpha) can beat down anyone all day without anyone batting an eye however as soon as whoever is being beat down gets a lick in or two the whole troop will intervene to stop the fight.  \n\n I believe some people say it could be to prevent death or major injury but I don\u2019t understand why that doesn\u2019t apply to the party being attacked."]}
