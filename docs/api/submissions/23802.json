We have two daughters. Our youngest is only 2 whereas our oldest, let\u2019s call her Mia recently turned 10. We are in Scotland and Mia is going back to primary school later this month and starting primary 6. Basically, for those not familiar with UK schooling, it\u2019s her second last year of primary school and she will be in high school in 2 years time when she is 12. It\u2019s a similar schooling system to England except kids start school here a year later at 5 rather than 4. \n\nAnyway, Mia was very adamant she wanted a phone for her birthday and Chris and I refused simply because we set a hard rule that she is too young for a phone and won\u2019t be getting one until she starts high school when she\u2019ll actually need it. I need to emphasise that Mia has access to contacting her friends online through us and an iPad with parental controls. For example, she has a few gaming apps that are kid friendly to play with her friends and she frequently FaceTimes them from my phone or Chris\u2019 phone. My point is, we are aware of how and who she contacts and we are always around or monitoring it. The parents of her friends have more or less similar setups as us with their kids generally being supervised and using their phones or whatever. We also limit the time she is on it so she\u2019s not addicted to it. Chris and I are always around supervising or Mia is always supervised and has boundaries so she can have you know a childhood. It will be the exact same with our other daughter when she is Mia\u2019s age and she also won\u2019t be getting a phone until she is 12. I feel like these are reasonable and healthy boundaries for any decent parent to have.\n\nMia kept going on and on about it to our family and I explained as did Chris multiple times that she is not getting a phone and said to our family to please not buy Mia one, no matter how much she begs explaining we have set healthy boundaries and she does not need one. Well, my sister bought one. She handed it to me and told me to surprise Mia with it cos she said \u2018a lot of kids her age have one so she shouldn\u2019t be left out.\u2019 I told my sister I wasn\u2019t accepting it and told her that I asked the family not to get her anything like that and she\u2019s been all bitchy with me ever since.\n\nMy sister says I humiliated her and was rude to not accept such an expensive present. I told her she is undermining what I think is a reasonable boundary as a present and told her I didn\u2019t want anyone buying Mia a phone. I have even told her to return it or keep it for herself as I\u2019m\nNot accepting it. She has been passive aggressive with me since.\n\nMy parents say that my sister doesn\u2019t have children and is the \u2018fun aunt\u2019 and so doesn\u2019t understand parenting boundaries like I do and think I should apologise just so things aren\u2019t awkward. I may be coming across as an arsehole but I don\u2019t see why I should apologise and told my parents as much. Chris thinks my sister crossed a line and thinks I should stick to my principles. My brother who is also childless is in agreement with me and Chris too.\n\nETA: my sister is 23 and our brother is 28.\n\nI also commented this so I\u2019ve copied it here:\n\nShe hasn\u2019t done this before with my daughter regarding expensive gifts bur my sister is 23 and the baby of the family and doesn\u2019t always have a clue about things or some of the things she says sometimes especially since I\u2019m 15 years older than her so our world views are definitely not the same.\n\nShe tries too hard to be their best friend.", "created_utc": 1691074602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h6iib/aita_for_returning_a_birthday_gift_my_sister_got/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The one mistake you might have made is not being firm enough (aka trying to be too \"nice\").  Sister crossed a line and that should have been the end of it.", "NTA. You and your husband are setting an important boundary for your child. Your sister has no right to interfere with your parenting like this. No need to apologize on your end... its your sister who needs to offer one up.", "NTA. You're the parent, not your sister. She needs to respect the way that you are raising your child. You don't need to apologize at all. You asked her not to do it, and she did it anyway.

It could be a little earlier, or a little later, but it is certainly in the good parenting continuum. Your sister should have respected your wishes, it is actually a little strange she would undermine on this. Does she have an history of doing this? \n\n\nThe only thing I'd say is culture and technology change, so keep an open mind if for some reason it seems a good idea to give one of your kids a phone earlier. What I mean is do not make a principle of the thing, stay flexible, circumstances can change. But as it is, your sister is definitely in the wrong and you don't need to apologize.", "NTA. I just said this in another comment and it widely applies. She doesn't have to understand or agree with your rule for your daughter but she does have to respect it. That's basically it for all friends and relatives of kids (unless there's abuse happening obviously). \n\nAlso, being the \"fun aunt\" doesn't mean you get to stomp all over boundaries set by the parents. That's a good way to become the \"aunt we no longer talk to.\"", "NTA you and your husband set boundaries for your kids that should be respected.

Good luck with this situation.", "NTA. Your kids, your healthy limits. If you decided the kids won't have a cellphone until 12 but didn't say family shouldn't give one to them, I would see how your sister would get offended.\nBut you set a line and explicitly said no one should buy the kid a cellphone.\n\n\nPlain and simple.", "NTA - I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty as I write this because my sister told me not to get her toddler son an iPad for Christmas and I did it anyway.

You and your husband set a boundary, it was a reasonable one but that is irrelevant. It was a boundary and it wasn\u2019t abusive. Your sister ignored your parenting and you remedied that.

Other than that your sister sounds like a nice person. All I can say to her is just don\u2019t metal in other peoples business.\n\nOverall, OP NAH.\n\nI\u2019m giving your sister maybe 0.5/5 AH Points,  there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to have a good relationship with your niece or nephew, but the only thing I could say, is just don\u2019t metal in other peoples lives or business, and don\u2019t step all over their boundaries, she could still be a cool aunt while, not stepping on your boundaries.\n\nI\u2019m giving you 0/5 AH Points, you\u2019re just setting up boundaries with your family, which is a good thing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As in, i checked with their parents to see if there was anything they wanted in particular and would run a few ideas by them. If they didn\u2019t approve, I didn\u2019t get it OR MENTION IT to the kids, so no disappointment for them nor conflict for me or their parents. \n\nYou set incredibly reasonable and clear  boundaries. Your sister stomped all over them. She\u2019s also being incredibly manipulative by giving the gift in front of others\u2014in a fairly blatant effort to force your hand by embarrassing you in front of others. Again, to manipulate your feelings. By claiming you embarrassed her, she is both deflecting accountability for a problem she created for herself, entirely by herself. Both Another tactic to manipulate you and the rest of your family to pressure you and Chris either to cave and let your kid have the phone or apologize and shoulder some or all of the blame for the situation. In either of those scenarios, she gets her way/controls the situation and family dynamic. Like she always has? \n\nA guess and I may be dying, but I suspect mom and dad, by their behavior here, have been asking you to sacrifice/apologize to your sis your whole life, just to keep the peace. If I\u2019m correct, that\u2019s why she feels entitled to act this way. It may actually come from a wholesome place\u2014her desire to connect with your kid. That\u2019s great and you can acknowledge that when you speak (not apologize) to her. But, she doesn\u2019t get to forge a relationship with your kid by violating your boundaries AND potentially straining you/child\u2019s relationship (I\u2019m guessing here that your daughter was elated to get a phone and heartbroken, maybe angry, that she had to give it up immediately).\n\nYes, yes\u2026your sister is young and ignorant about kids. That literally does not matter. This isn\u2019t even about having kids or not. This is about her disrespecting you and your husband. Period. She\u2019s old enough to know about boundaries and respect, and she willfully violated yours. You should not apologize. Frankly, she owes you, Chris, and your DAUGHTER an apology. And then, hopefully she learns her lesson.", "NTA and stop making excuses for your sister. 23 is old enough to know that you, as the parents, get to decide when your daughter is old enough for a phone; it is not her decision as the \"fun aunt\"\n\nMy kids were 12 before they got their first phone - they saw their friends every day in school and played out with them after school. Children do not need phones when they are in primary school, especially as you allow her to use electronics at home.\n\nYour sister should be apologising for trying to undermine you and for sulking about you standing on your guns. Tell her to grow up and point out that she probably wouldn't like it if you deliberately disrespected her wishes if/when she has children of her own.", "Right? I love being the fun aunt. And I stay in my niece\u2019s life by not stomping over my sibling\u2019s parenting choices.", "This. I am the youngest of my siblings and for a long time I felt like my siblings didn\u2019t really see me as an adult at all. Just as their little sister. Maybe the sister wanted to show YOU that she cares about your child and is a responsible adult who is well off enough to be able to buy an expensive present (iow a \u201cmature and settled\u201d adult)? Misguided, and she shouldn\u2019t have crossed the boundaries you have set like that. So NTA. But maybe a part of her just never feels she is good enough for you and now your reaction has reinforced that? I think trying to just approach each other as two adults and talking about whatever which doesn\u2019t hinge on the fact that she is the \u201cbaby sister\u201d might not be the worst idea.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t get a phone until less than a year ago (I\u2019m a teen). You reminded me of my parents except they\u2019re a decent bit more lax. I definitely spend a lot of time on electronics but I\u2019m not addicted. I read, I talk to my friends, I play sports/exercise and I chill with my family and my dog. You are far from NTA but your sister is TA.", "Ok so I'm the youngest of 3 and became an aunt at 22. I still knew better than to push the parents boundaries. I am very much the fun aunt to all three of my nephews but what their parents say, goes. Its that simple. NTA", "We gave our kids phones in their last summer term of primary, to get used to having and using them for travel etc.\n\nNo need for earlier at all. NTA.", "I had typed out something similar, but it was too long. You also said exactly what I was thinking about the gift! \n\nAdult relationships with siblings with pretty big age gaps are possible! And so beautiful! I love my older sister with all my heart and she has truly been my rock over the last year after a breakup from a long term relationship. When I was little I looked up to her, and once I started coming into my own as an adult she was the first to accept me as such, while still \u201cbig sistering\u201d me!", "Ohhh I used to have one of those!", "Nta, she's your daughter and you make the rules", ">She handed it to me and told me to surprise Mia with it  \n>  \n>My sister says I humiliated her\n\nShe's not humiliated. She was pre-warned you would not be accepting phones as a gift for Mia and didn't give it to you infront of a crowd so there's no one to be humiliated to. She's mad she didn't get her way after thinking she could just ignore your wishes and do what she wanted.\n\n>My parents say that my sister doesn\u2019t have children and is the \u2018fun aunt\u2019 and so doesn\u2019t understand parenting boundaries\n\nThese things are not correlated, because respecting boundaries has nothing to do with being a parent.\n\nNTA", "I am both a mother and an aunt.\n\nThere\u2019s no way I would buy my niblings something that their parents prohibited (for whatever reason).  And I would be very ticked off if one of my siblings undermined me by buying a prohibited item for my kid.\n\nNTA", "'Fun Aunts' usually mean they let the kids do whatever they want, that's why you have rules.  What your doing is sensibly parenting your oldest daughter, more people should do this.  No big loss if your sister shuts you out, she's trouble.  NTAH.", "I have to say, I personally believe in having a balance here (but I'm in no way saying you're in the wrong- just wanted to put this out there.)\n I got my first phone around 10, but it was a super simple flip phone that didn't have internet access- it was simply to text friends/family and especially in case of emergencies since my parents worked a lot when I was a kid.\n The understanding was that my mom could see who I was talking to whenever she asked, or the phone would have texting/calling removed besides emergency features.\nI was only able to watch videos/go online via the family computer or my moms phone, which she both monitored. I was always cool with letting her know who I talked to since I was like 10 years old and probably only talked to like 5 friends from school lol.\nPoint is though, I don't think you're in the wrong whatsoever in not wanting her to have a smartphone. I just wanted to say my experience with a super simple phone since that worked really well for us, and I do think it's important for kids to be able to contact their parents or emergency services if something ever happens :)", "Nta. Buying someone a gift that you know they aren't allowed us an ahole move. Your the parent you set the boundaries... It could be no paint because paint is a massive mess... Or no crayons because they've gotten in the dryer one to many times. The point is if you're saying no people just need to back off and your sister owes you an apology for trying to undermine you, you do not apologize for ruining her 'cool aunt's dreams. But may I suggest you buy one of those fisher-price popcorn walkers if she ever decides to have kids.", "NTA Buying a phone for a tween or even a teenager when their parents say no is completely unacceptable.  I say this as the aunt that buys the loud toys, the Lego sets that are \"too expensive\", and earrings that are just a little bit too big for mom to like.  Being the cool aunt/uncle is fun, but this crosses boundaries for sure.  You have nothing to apologize for.", "I was out of the house whilst she was growing up. My brother was there for her but there\u2019s still 5 years between her and him. I do talk to my sister, I\u2019m not just in mum mode all the time. I\u2019m very aware I\u2019m older than her by a large margin but our relationship has always been very good. I did approach her as an adult I feel.", "I just memorised my house number and used a payphone or a friends or asked a stranger if needed."]}
