I don\u2019t believe in preventing him from doing \u201cfeminine\u201d things just because he\u2019s a boy. His favorite color is pink, so because he got straight A\u2019s on his last report card, I let him dye two front strands of his hair that color. He likes making jewelry too, so sometimes we\u2019ll just sit together and make earrings out of fun stuff we find at the craft store.

She always expresses that opinion in a negative way, and both my husband and I have told her many times to refrain from criticizing my child for the simple crime of being himself.\n\nOn Friday, Nas came in from school while my MIL was the only one home. I had to work late, and Zach was finishing up a meeting, so Nas rode the bus. While he was on the bus he let one of his friends do his eyeliner, and when my MIL saw it, she immediately told him to wash it off. He refused to, because he said he liked it and he\u2019d wash it off before he went to bed.\n\nBy the time Zach got home, MIL was still lecturing Nas about it, and Nas apparently snapped and said \u201cI get that you\u2019re mad that a boy is prettier than you, but I\u2019m tired of hearing about it.\u201d\nThat upset her even more and Zach tried to get Nas to apologize to her but Nas refused.\n\nWhen I got there, MIL and Zach told me what had happened, and I said that Nas wouldn\u2019t have said anything had she not been bothering him first. If Nas had to apologize, then she should say sorry too.\nMIL refused so I said \u201cokay. Then I\u2019m not going to make him do it either.\u201d\n\nMy husband is upset with me and thinks I should just teach my son to be the bigger person, because this won\u2019t be the only time someone has a problem with \u201chow he is\u201d.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019m willing to teach my son through any of this is that he shouldn\u2019t be sharing eyeliner because of germs.\n\nZach is insisting that Nas was disrespectful, but even if he was, I think it was justified.", "created_utc": 1667677823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn48tz/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_son_apologize_to_my/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
