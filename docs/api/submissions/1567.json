I don\u2019t believe in preventing him from doing \u201cfeminine\u201d things just because he\u2019s a boy. His favorite color is pink, so because he got straight A\u2019s on his last report card, I let him dye two front strands of his hair that color. He likes making jewelry too, so sometimes we\u2019ll just sit together and make earrings out of fun stuff we find at the craft store. He\u2019s also recently gotten into painting his nails, and I just love seeing how happy he is when he gets to express himself the way he wants to.\n\nMy MIL came to stay with us while the HVAC system in her house gets fixed. One of the repair guys blew a fuse so it\u2019s taking longer than expected and I\u2019m honestly losing my mind a little bit. She\u2019s always been critical of me, either for the fact that I had a child at 20 with a guy I wasn\u2019t married to, or because I very much expect my husband to treat me as an equal partner rather than as his mother 2.0.\n\nShe\u2019s of the opinion that my refusal to abide by traditional gender roles is what has resulted in my son being \u201cthe way he is\u201d. She always expresses that opinion in a negative way, and both my husband and I have told her many times to refrain from criticizing my child for the simple crime of being himself.\n\nOn Friday, Nas came in from school while my MIL was the only one home. I had to work late, and Zach was finishing up a meeting, so Nas rode the bus. While he was on the bus he let one of his friends do his eyeliner, and when my MIL saw it, she immediately told him to wash it off. He refused to, because he said he liked it and he\u2019d wash it off before he went to bed.\n\nBy the time Zach got home, MIL was still lecturing Nas about it, and Nas apparently snapped and said \u201cI get that you\u2019re mad that a boy is prettier than you, but I\u2019m tired of hearing about it.\u201d\nThat upset her even more and Zach tried to get Nas to apologize to her but Nas refused.\n\nWhen I got there, MIL and Zach told me what had happened, and I said that Nas wouldn\u2019t have said anything had she not been bothering him first. If Nas had to apologize, then she should say sorry too.\nMIL refused so I said \u201cokay. Then I\u2019m not going to make him do it either.\u201d\n\nMy husband is upset with me and thinks I should just teach my son to be the bigger person, because this won\u2019t be the only time someone has a problem with \u201chow he is\u201d.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019m willing to teach my son through any of this is that he shouldn\u2019t be sharing eyeliner because of germs.\n\nZach is insisting that Nas was disrespectful, but even if he was, I think it was justified.", "created_utc": 1667677823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn48tz/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_son_apologize_to_my/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That doesn't make you any better thought of as a person, just a doormat to others opinions.\n\nYour husband is wrong.

Period.\n\nNas isn't hurting ANYONE by expressing himself in a way that makes him feel good about himself.\n\nMIL is expressing herself in a way that cuts someone else down.\n\nMIL needs to apologize for trying to force Nas to do something he didn't want to do, when he wasn't hurting anyone. (Definitely give Nas a talk on sharing personal care items though; could easily have gotten an infection from using someone else's eyeliner. Excellent point!)\n\nOnce MIL apologizes, Nas has the choice to decide if he wants to apologize or not. She was hurtful, mean, and disrespectful. It's 2022. We aren't doing toxic shit with no repercussions anymore. If he chooses to, in order to keep the peace, that shows a great deal of maturity on his part, and you should be proud. If he chooses not to, that shows a healthy amount of self-respect and wisdom in setting boundaries, and you should still be proud.\n\nHusband needs to apologize to you for taking MIL's side, when she's clearly in the wrong. You're a team. He should have your back. He should have his family's back. \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\"", "NTA.

Is it really for your son\u2019s benefit to just roll over and apologise for something where he clearly wasn\u2019t in the wrong? Or is it beneficial for hubby, as he gets to keep the peace with MIL? Is he really wants you to teach your son, that he shouldn\u2019t be himself because people will have problems with that? He shouldn\u2019t defend himself because he might upset someone?
