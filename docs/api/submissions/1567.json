He likes making jewelry too, so sometimes we\u2019ll just sit together and make earrings out of fun stuff we find at the craft store.

I had to work late, and Zach was finishing up a meeting, so Nas rode the bus. While he was on the bus he let one of his friends do his eyeliner, and when my MIL saw it, she immediately told him to wash it off. He refused to, because he said he liked it and he\u2019d wash it off before he went to bed.\n\nBy the time Zach got home, MIL was still lecturing Nas about it, and Nas apparently snapped and said \u201cI get that you\u2019re mad that a boy is prettier than you, but I\u2019m tired of hearing about it.\u201d\nThat upset her even more and Zach tried to get Nas to apologize to her but Nas refused.\n\nWhen I got there, MIL and Zach told me what had happened, and I said that Nas wouldn\u2019t have said anything had she not been bothering him first. If Nas had to apologize, then she should say sorry too.\nMIL refused so I said \u201cokay.
