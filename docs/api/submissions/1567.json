I don\u2019t believe in preventing him from doing \u201cfeminine\u201d things just because he\u2019s a boy. His favorite color is pink, so because he got straight A\u2019s on his last report card, I let him dye two front strands of his hair that color. He likes making jewelry too, so sometimes we\u2019ll just sit together and make earrings out of fun stuff we find at the craft store.

She always expresses that opinion in a negative way, and both my husband and I have told her many times to refrain from criticizing my child for the simple crime of being himself.\n\nOn Friday, Nas came in from school while my MIL was the only one home. I had to work late, and Zach was finishing up a meeting, so Nas rode the bus. While he was on the bus he let one of his friends do his eyeliner, and when my MIL saw it, she immediately told him to wash it off. He refused to, because he said he liked it and he\u2019d wash it off before he went to bed.\n\nBy the time Zach got home, MIL was still lecturing Nas about it, and Nas apparently snapped and said \u201cI get that you\u2019re mad that a boy is prettier than you, but I\u2019m tired of hearing about it.\u201d\nThat upset her even more and Zach tried to get Nas to apologize to her but Nas refused.\n\nWhen I got there, MIL and Zach told me what had happened, and I said that Nas wouldn\u2019t have said anything had she not been bothering him first. If Nas had to apologize, then she should say sorry too.\nMIL refused so I said \u201cokay. Then I\u2019m not going to make him do it either.\u201d\n\nMy husband is upset with me and thinks I should just teach my son to be the bigger person, because this won\u2019t be the only time someone has a problem with \u201chow he is\u201d.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019m willing to teach my son through any of this is that he shouldn\u2019t be sharing eyeliner because of germs.\n\nZach is insisting that Nas was disrespectful, but even if he was, I think it was justified.", "created_utc": 1667677823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn48tz/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_son_apologize_to_my/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes he'll probably come against a lot of prejudice, but that child is already strong and has a whip sharp tongue at 13 years old.

She\u2019s definitely the AH in this situation and your husband is a close second. You will need to nip that in the bud now. \n\nYour sweet son doesn\u2019t need his own family having issues with \u201chow he is\u201d  which is really crappy of him to say because Nas sounds like a well rounded delightful young man who happens to enjoy cool things that happen to not be stereotypical of teen guys.

Any one in my family (or my husband's family), that dares to disrespect them in gone from our lives.  A slip up with names or preferred pronouns is inevitable, so a gentle reminder is given, but anything ignorant regarding gender, sexuality,etc means you're out.  \nPlease take it from me that your child will endure awful things from strangers as they don't conform to social \"norms\", so they deserve a safe space with their family.\nIf your MIL and husband can't agree, tell them both to take a long walk off a short pier", "NTA, but you have a husband problem as well as a MIL problem.

As the victim of your MIL's unwanted, unasked for, and frankly worthless diatribes your son has every right to tell her off, and what he said was frankly not even that bad. I can think of a few things he could have called her, and for those purposes may I recommend George Carlin's skit about, \"seven words you can't say on TV\"? \n\nSee, I say it's privileged, because even if your son is straight he's still GNC and subject to discrimination in future from people who won't be civil, and that doesn't get any better just because he's civil back. He **will** have to carry a big stick as it were to back his words, and he has every right to treat shitty people in kind for their behaviour.

In cases like this, I think your husband\u2019s response is not as equally damning as your MIL\u2019s actions. He seems to be approaching what he thinks is appropriate behavior from a place of worry/care for Nas, not so much just that he said something deemed disrespectful.  If you two can have a conversation about the worth about how the world will treat Nas and gender expression outside the context of gross MIL, I hope that can bring him around to understanding your approach and equally dispel sons of his fears about the way a kiddo he cares about is going to be treated by the world.

Why does he not tell his mother to \u201cbe the better person\u201d for her hateful attitudes and actions. It is people like your MIL that you have to worry about your son being the beautiful soul that he is with their hate and disrespect thinking that their way is the right way. Even if she looked like a supermodel her attitude makes her ugly and your son just gave her back what she was giving him. Just because she is his elder, part of another quote I hate, does not means she deserves his respect because she has managed to breathe longer than he has respect is an earned privilege not a time given right.

Oh I am over here absolutely howling over all of that shade. Go Nas!!! \n\n\n\"Be the bigger person\" is just code for Door Mat.

It also sounds like he doesn't just agree with his mother because he's trying to support her argument, but like he actually agrees with his mother's argument and doesn't like how your kid dresses.
