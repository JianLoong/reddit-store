{"id": 5919, "submission_id": "zy2m1y", "title": "AITA for asking somebody why they are parking outside my house?", "selftext": "I work afternoon shifts. I leave my house at the same time each weekday. Over the last 2 weeks I\u2019ve noticed an SUV with personalised plates parked just outside my house on the kerb. (Aussie spelling). \n\nI\u2019ve lived in the same house for a few years and it\u2019s a quiet neighbourhood. This car is not one I\u2019ve seen here before. \n\nIt appears at around 1 - 2pm each day. It\u2019s always running, auto lights on and there is always a brunette woman (mid 30s?) sitting inside. \n\nShe\u2019s well within her rights to be there. It\u2019s a public space. But just because I\u2019ve never seen her before and she keeps appearing and just sitting there, not visiting anybody or seeming to be leaving the vehicle\u2026 I started to feel a little weirded out. And possibly because it\u2019s right at my house, I feel like she watches me come and go. \n\n(She gave me private investigator vibes, but I do have anxiety so maybe not.)\n\nSo today I had a day off and I had had enough of wondering. So, purely out of curiosity, I decided to go and speak to the woman in the car. \n\nAs I went out there I noticed her raise her phone. (Taking a photo of me maybe?) I calmly went to her window and introduced myself to her. I mentioned that I noticed her in the area recently. I asked her if there was anything I can help with (kind of trying to be polite but find out who the heck she is). \n\nShe got extremely defensive and started to record me on her phone. She pointed to her back seat and told me I am waking her baby up. She told me she parks her car here under the shade of the tree (many trees in my area so I\u2019m not sure this makes sense lol). She explained that she can\u2019t get her baby to sleep and he has severe back pain so she can\u2019t hold the baby. \n\nTbh, the windows were decently tinted but I didn\u2019t see a baby in the back. I can\u2019t say for sure whether there was a baby in there or not, just that I never saw/heard one. \n\nThe woman was very well dressed in a business shirt. Didn\u2019t really look like a struggling mother to me, but then again, maybe she just loves to dress like that. \n\nI questioned her casually. Like why she was not parking at her own house? I asked her if she needed any help and she took offence. It just wasn\u2019t adding up so I was asking a few questions like that. \n\nShe got extremely angry and said I was a judgemental person for assuming she needs help. I didn\u2019t mean it in that way at all. I\u2019ve had babies and totally understand how hard it can be to get them to sleep etc. \n\nThe defensiveness was a red flag to me though. \n\nNone of it made sense.  Maybe my anxiety and curiosity was misplaced and I should have stayed inside. I just couldn\u2019t stand to feel watched for another second. It was driving me crazy. \n\nAITA for even talking to her?", "created_utc": 1672311400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy2m1y/aita_for_asking_somebody_why_they_are_parking/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You waited weeks before approaching, spoke politely, even offered help. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. She could have politely said she was fine, didn\u2019t need any help. She got very defensive and perhaps it\u2019s because she has her own issues, but so do you and you\u2019re just trying to feel comfortable in your own home too. Polite questioning, not accusing, should be okay!", "NTA- I would also be weirded out by someone sitting outside my house every day. The woman recording you immediately is strange behavior.\n\n I understand that this is a public space, but I would still find it strange that someone with tinted windows is parked outside of your house every day while you are leaving for work.

If she\u2019s doing nothing wrong she won\u2019t care, but if she is she will not want to be recorded. Besides she recorded you first so she set the precedent. Also have some security cameras installed that point directly where she is. (Preferably have them put up while she\u2019s there) And if that doesn\u2019t stop her\u2026. Call the cops. Just tell them you are concerned and would like for them to check if she\u2019s mentally stable as she was super aggressive right away. Better to be safe than sorry.

If you are up for it get a dog too.", "If it really bothers you and if the car is still parked in front of your place for ne next couple of days, I would call the police and if you have CCTV, the you can show how often she parks there.. But as you stated, it is a public space and she can be there.. \n\nMaybe overreacting, but never know.. Just call the police and get over it..

Remember even men in business suits with good jobs can be shady af....and don't let soccer moms fool you either...doesn't matter how well dressed someone is: bad business could look like the grandma who bakes apple pies and cookies.", "NTA Sounds like she\u2019s watching one of your neighbours.  Leave it another couple of weeks, see what happens.  If it was anything connected with you, I think it would have played out differently.", "NTA for asking her but if she's not breaking any parking rules then you can't really do anything. I bet she's investigating someone with a worker's compo claim. That's the number one reason for surveillance outside of police investigations.  They want to catch people hauling bags of groceries, hanging out washing, that kind of thing that invalidates their claim.", "NTA for asking but her explanations seems very plausible.  It's not unusual for babies to only fall asleep in the car and she's just trying to get scheduled nap time in.  She found a routine that works including parking in the same spot.", "NTA, but definitely invest in security cameras for your home, call the non emergency line for the boys and girls in blue (NSW wear a blue uniform, not sure about the rest of the country) to get advice on what to do, and probably if you are in a community watch type group for your area, make a post there asking if anyone else has noticed a random car just parked outside their house or across the street.

It is weird what is occurring and certainly I would be worried .

Not on the sly but make it noticeable. Get one of her face. Ask your neighbours if she knows them. Just because she's dressed nicely, doesn't mean she's off the hook.

I would absolutely talk to someone who kept parking outside my house - while in it, no less!", "If she only started to try and photograph/record you when you approached, she may simply have been concerned about her own safety when this stranger was approaching her vehicle without, in her mind at least, any reason. \n\nI am assuming, given your comment about shade from trees, it was sunny/hot out and the engine was running just because of the ac, and if there was a baby in the back who found the white noise from the engine/ac soothing then it is understandable she may wish to park up rather than risk going over pot holes or speed bumps.\n\nShe was in a public space and had every right to be there, but for a polite approach because she was causing you anxiety then NAH.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of your business.", "Do you have a local community Facebook page you can ask the question in?

Sure,  it's odd, but she isn't breaking any laws.  If you're really that concerned,  take a picture of the vehicle,  including the license plates. Do it right in front of her.  That's every bit as legal as her parking there.", "Not the AH for the approach.

It actually makes me wonder if she\u2019s had a bad experience from that in the past.\n\nYTA for doubling down with extra questions and basically interrogating her when she\u2019d given you a reasonable explanation, just because she was well dressed and you couldn\u2019t see through tinted windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re still worried, take a pic of the car and report it to your local police station (not the emergency number) while mentioning your concerns.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
