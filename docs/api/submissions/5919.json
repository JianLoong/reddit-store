I leave my house at the same time each weekday. Over the last 2 weeks I\u2019ve noticed an SUV with personalised plates parked just outside my house on the kerb. (Aussie spelling). \n\nI\u2019ve lived in the same house for a few years and it\u2019s a quiet neighbourhood. This car is not one I\u2019ve seen here before. \n\nIt appears at around 1 - 2pm each day. It\u2019s always running, auto lights on and there is always a brunette woman (mid 30s?) sitting inside. \n\nShe\u2019s well within her rights to be there. It\u2019s a public space. But just because I\u2019ve never seen her before and she keeps appearing and just sitting there, not visiting anybody or seeming to be leaving the vehicle\u2026 I started to feel a little weirded out. And possibly because it\u2019s right at my house, I feel like she watches me come and go. \n\n(She gave me private investigator vibes, but I do have anxiety so maybe not.)\n\nSo today I had a day off and I had had enough of wondering. So, purely out of curiosity, I decided to go and speak to the woman in the car. \n\nAs I went out there I noticed her raise her phone. (Taking a photo of me maybe?) I calmly went to her window and introduced myself to her. I mentioned that I noticed her in the area recently. I asked her if there was anything I can help with (kind of trying to be polite but find out who the heck she is). \n\nShe got extremely defensive and started to record me on her phone. She pointed to her back seat and told me I am waking her baby up. She told me she parks her car here under the shade of the tree (many trees in my area so I\u2019m not sure this makes sense lol). She explained that she can\u2019t get her baby to sleep and he has severe back pain so she can\u2019t hold the baby. \n\nTbh, the windows were decently tinted but I didn\u2019t see a baby in the back. I can\u2019t say for sure whether there was a baby in there or not, just that I never saw/heard one. \n\nThe woman was very well dressed in a business shirt. Didn\u2019t really look like a struggling mother to me, but then again, maybe she just loves to dress like that. \n\nI questioned her casually. Like why she was not parking at her own house? I asked her if she needed any help and she took offence. It just wasn\u2019t adding up so I was asking a few questions like that. \n\nShe got extremely angry and said I was a judgemental person for assuming she needs help. I didn\u2019t mean it in that way at all. I\u2019ve had babies and totally understand how hard it can be to get them to sleep etc. \n\nThe defensiveness was a red flag to me though. \n\nNone of it made sense.  Maybe my anxiety and curiosity was misplaced and I should have stayed inside. I just couldn\u2019t stand to feel watched for another second. It was driving me crazy. \n\nAITA for even talking to her?\n\nInfo: both of us are white females.

She found a routine that works including parking in the same spot.", "NTA, but definitely invest in security cameras for your home, call the non emergency line for the boys and girls in blue (NSW wear a blue uniform, not sure about the rest of the country) to get advice on what to do, and probably if you are in a community watch type group for your area, make a post there asking if anyone else has noticed a random car just parked outside their house or across the street.

He never got out and never helped his kid. There are 3 closer side streets on our side and four on the other between ours and the school. By the end of the year it was hot and I saw the kid again, struggling. I walked down, said hello and offered to help. I carried the instrument and put it in the car for the kid who said thank you and left.

That is a nutshell what happened and the cops will come by to question her.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work I would personal park my car right next to her blast music with lots of bass (at a volume loud enough to wake up the baby, but not loud enough to disturb your neighbors). If there really is a baby in the car and it can\u2019t sleep, she\u2019ll have no choice but to move to some other tree.", "NTA. She can park there all she likes, it\u2019s a public street\u2026but you\u2019re not obliged to pretend she doesn\u2019t exist. She\u2019s right outside your house.

LOL! Michiganders can have thick midwestern accents, but we also have a tendency to shorten or abbreviate what we say via a unique vernacular.  For sure southern folks speak more slowly. California is such a mix, owing to it being such a large and diverse state, and having such a rich cultural history, that it can feel like traveling to different countries just by driving from one place to another. TBF, we were only in Seattle, Washington for one summer while I underwent some pretty intense treatments, but everyone there we spoke to was very clear but also \u201claid back\u201d, if that makes sense. No one seemed to ever be in a hurry, and they were very polite.
