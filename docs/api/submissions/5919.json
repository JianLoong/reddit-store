I leave my house at the same time each weekday. Over the last 2 weeks I\u2019ve noticed an SUV with personalised plates parked just outside my house on the kerb. (Aussie spelling). \n\nI\u2019ve lived in the same house for a few years and it\u2019s a quiet neighbourhood. This car is not one I\u2019ve seen here before. \n\nIt appears at around 1 - 2pm each day. It\u2019s always running, auto lights on and there is always a brunette woman (mid 30s?) sitting inside. \n\nShe\u2019s well within her rights to be there. It\u2019s a public space. But just because I\u2019ve never seen her before and she keeps appearing and just sitting there, not visiting anybody or seeming to be leaving the vehicle\u2026 I started to feel a little weirded out. And possibly because it\u2019s right at my house, I feel like she watches me come and go. \n\n(She gave me private investigator vibes, but I do have anxiety so maybe not.)\n\nSo today I had a day off and I had had enough of wondering. So, purely out of curiosity, I decided to go and speak to the woman in the car. \n\nAs I went out there I noticed her raise her phone. (Taking a photo of me maybe?) I calmly went to her window and introduced myself to her. I mentioned that I noticed her in the area recently. I asked her if there was anything I can help with (kind of trying to be polite but find out who the heck she is). \n\nShe got extremely defensive and started to record me on her phone. She pointed to her back seat and told me I am waking her baby up. She told me she parks her car here under the shade of the tree (many trees in my area so I\u2019m not sure this makes sense lol). She explained that she can\u2019t get her baby to sleep and he has severe back pain so she can\u2019t hold the baby. \n\nTbh, the windows were decently tinted but I didn\u2019t see a baby in the back. I can\u2019t say for sure whether there was a baby in there or not, just that I never saw/heard one. \n\nThe woman was very well dressed in a business shirt. Didn\u2019t really look like a struggling mother to me, but then again, maybe she just loves to dress like that. \n\nI questioned her casually. Like why she was not parking at her own house? I asked her if she needed any help and she took offence. It just wasn\u2019t adding up so I was asking a few questions like that. \n\nShe got extremely angry and said I was a judgemental person for assuming she needs help. I didn\u2019t mean it in that way at all. I\u2019ve had babies and totally understand how hard it can be to get them to sleep etc. \n\nThe defensiveness was a red flag to me though. \n\nNone of it made sense.  Maybe my anxiety and curiosity was misplaced and I should have stayed inside. I just couldn\u2019t stand to feel watched for another second. It was driving me crazy. \n\nAITA for even talking to her?", "created_utc": 1672311400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy2m1y/aita_for_asking_somebody_why_they_are_parking/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You waited weeks before approaching, spoke politely, even offered help. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. She could have politely said she was fine, didn\u2019t need any help.

It's not unusual for babies to only fall asleep in the car and she's just trying to get scheduled nap time in.  She found a routine that works including parking in the same spot.", "NTA, but definitely invest in security cameras for your home, call the non emergency line for the boys and girls in blue (NSW wear a blue uniform, not sure about the rest of the country) to get advice on what to do, and probably if you are in a community watch type group for your area, make a post there asking if anyone else has noticed a random car just parked outside their house or across the street.

He never got out and never helped his kid. There are 3 closer side streets on our side and four on the other between ours and the school. By the end of the year it was hot and I saw the kid again, struggling. I walked down, said hello and offered to help. I carried the instrument and put it in the car for the kid who said thank you and left.

That is a nutshell what happened and the cops will come by to question her.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work I would personal park my car right next to her blast music with lots of bass (at a volume loud enough to wake up the baby, but not loud enough to disturb your neighbors). If there really is a baby in the car and it can\u2019t sleep, she\u2019ll have no choice but to move to some other tree.", "NTA. She can park there all she likes, it\u2019s a public street\u2026but you\u2019re not obliged to pretend she doesn\u2019t exist. She\u2019s right outside your house. Start giving her a big smile and wave whenever you go past. If you\u2019re on the way in, tell her you\u2019re about to put the kettle on and ask if she\u2019d like a cuppa.

You weren\u2019t being rude.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nThis is super weird. \n\nI think it's better to be safe than sorry, and approaching someone can basically let them know you're onto them or they seem really odd without you having to say anything explicitly. But on the other hand, it can also put you in danger.\n\nIf she was just someone who had a baby and had to take it in the car for it to sleep, why be defensive? I would just say \"Oh sorry, didn't mean to bother you\" if I were in that position, and I think a lot of other people would too.\n\nEveryone should be aware of how odd that behaviour would seem. If she's a PI she's an awful one. \n\nInvest in a surveillance camera. You can get entire systems for not much. My stepdad set his own up and it has paid off. Record licence plate and car description, along with the times you see her and how often. If she keeps coming back, it would be a good idea to make a report. You really never know. It could turn out to be nothing at all and no harm would be done.", "NTA that would weird me out too. The fact that she seemed to be recording and taking pics when you were just asking a simple question and getting defensive is a big red flag for me. If it\u2019s innocent her response was a bit over the top. It\u2019s not like you came out yelling at her to move.", "NTA\n\nEven if her baby sleeping and back problem story is true, why can't she park her car in the shade somewhere more justifiably occupied by a random member of the public? Nobody would be particularly bothered if she was at a neighbourhood park, shopping centre, or community facility every day, obviously street parking is legal in front of your house and she's technically allowed to park there, but it's a weird location to choose for innocent motives. Then she gets hostile that the homeowner strikes up a casual conversation because they want to put their mind at ease over a weird stalker-like thing that has become regular occurrence.\n\nSomething's sketch, get a security camera.", "NTA. Always trust your gut. And if she is there again, makes point of recording her. At the very least get pictures of her tags and vehicle. Stay vigilant and safe.", "NTA seems sketchy as hell. Play loud music next time she parks outside and see if she leaves? If its truly to get the baby to sleep she will stop coming", "YTA for this:\n\n>I asked her if there was anything I can help with\n\nbecause that's not what you were actually interested in. It's not polite having a hidden agenda, just ask what you want to ask.", "Tinted windows make me think there could be prostitution involved.", "Sounds completely suspicious. NTA", "TIL: In Australia apparently we say kerb, \n\nI have always used \u201ccurb\u201d and have lived here my whole life.", "NTA and yes, it's very fishy... Maybe a PI or a woman who suspected her boyfriend/husband was cheating on her and she was hoping to caught him. It could also be a burglar who wants to break in Op's house but why wasn't she more discreet ? \n\nCalling the cops next time she come could be a good thing. \n\n(english is not my first language btw)", "The weeks part is what got me. I've totally pulled over in front of someone's house to make a call, check an email, look up directions, I even once did a teledoc appt in front of a stranger's house. Sometimes you need to pull over on the road and get stuff taken care of. \n\nBut I've never stopped in front of the same house twice.", "Hopefully now you've said something they just move on a park somewhere else", "I agree. I've had the cops called on me for doing the same thing (without any locals coming to chat with me first). The street was a small circle that had a park on the inside area and housing on the outside. It was just down the road and out of sight of my workplace. I used to park there during my lunch breaks to eat because I would get harassed to keep working through lunch otherwise. And in an Aussie summer you bet I had that car and a/c running.\n\nThe cops and I had a good laugh about it at the time and on the nicer days I made a habit of getting out of my car with my lunch and my book to try and reassure the locals I wasn't there to cause trouble. Calling the cops was a totally reasonable thing for them to do though.", "[removed]", "Or maybe stop bothering people who are not doing anything wrong?", "I have always used \u201ccurb\u201d and have lived here my whole life.", "If this post is still going tomorrow I\u2019ll let you know if she pulls up again at 1pm lol. It\u2019s currently 12.51am here so we need to wait a while \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019ll keep you posted.  And I really hope she doesn\u2019t return tomorrow!!", "Same here. I think I\u2019ve driven all of my kids at some point.  But as soon as I would park they would wake up most of the time. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit with them on the street like that", "This. Everyone is fucking crazy. Leave others the fuck alone, it's not that hard. It has nothing to do with you.", "\ud83d\ude05 that\u2019s a good suggestion.  Mine is secured for sure.   Right near my house (2 minutes away) there is a large amazing park. There is free wifi available there offered through the local council. Also plenty of shady places to park a car", "Oh good point", "I don\u2019t have any cameras yet but I recently bought a cool ring cam on Amazon for my dad for Christmas. He said it\u2019s really good so I think I\u2019ll get one for myself too!", "Agreed. Done this with my first . I had no reason to pull into a residential area and I would not park in the same spot everyday and at the same time. If I parked it would be a parking lot, store ect. If I happened to stop outside a house it sure wouldn't be the same one everyday thats beyond weird.  Her reaction was bizarre if she was doing what she said she was doing.", "Also \"she didn't look like a struggling mother\" makes me question OPs judgment.", "Oh, that's a great idea! I second this.", "Sir, *what*", "According to google. You can spell it either way in Australia. I\u2019ve grown up spelling it \u201ckerb\u201d.

It\u2019s really not relevant to the post.", "That's what I was thinking. She's scoping out the neighborhood, checking people's routines so she can report to her thieving friends.", "That's what I was thinking. She's looking for a cheating partner.", "Yeah, my mind went to burglar too.", "You could also park your car there if you have one.", "I'm presuming your Aussie, you can send through to police link  instead of actually calling in so there's a report saying something and since it isn't \"urgent\" might make you feel better. It's really odd behaviour even if it isn't illegal. I'd make sure you have the details of the car. \nHopefully now you've said something they just move on a park somewhere else", "Are you really sure she's not?

If  OP videoing her is such a problem then why are you ok with the other lady videoing her first?", "Go take a picture every time she parks outside. With time stamps.

She can park there, you can take photos outside your own house.", "I feel like no one wants to feel watched for weeks at a time but maybe that's just me.", "Seems like the shadiest thing is her behavior.", "Definitely do so!

I used to work a job that drove around testing cell phone reception. If I parked in front of almost any house for more then 15 minutes people come out to question me or call the police.

Don't be a dick about it but still inquire.", "Ahh. See this is the type of crap that turns me off getting one! It\u2019s part of the reason I don\u2019t have cameras yet.

They don't do it that obviously and then record you when you approach. Nor do they sit in the same spot for days or even weeks. And they also don't just sit in their car and look, that doesn't give them much information, they have to get closer to the houses to actually case them and see if they have security systems.", "And they wouldn't do it at the same time everyday.
