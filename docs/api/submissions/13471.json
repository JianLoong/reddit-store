The kid was understandably terrified and asked me to let him Venmo me the money to fix it so it wouldn\u2019t increase his insurance. He showed me his bank account and he had more than enough to pay for it but I told him no anyway. I thought he would be more careful in the future if he had to pay more a month in insurance. I told him to show me his insurance information so I could call and make a claim. He refused because he could pay out of pocket and he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an insurance increase. I started to get irritated because this could\u2019ve been easier if he made it easier. He called his parents and told them about the accident. We waited for them to come so they could look at the damages. When they saw it wasn\u2019t bad they also wanted him to pay out of pocket. His parents also refused to exchange insurance so I got the police involved to get their information. When the officer got here I told him what happened and how they refused to exchange information then he told me they didn\u2019t have to since the damages were minor and they\u2019re willing to pay out of pocket.

He gave her 150 that day and 150 a month later. She also got a date out of it, which is kinda funny. What was the purpose of making him report it to insurance? Do you think it was going to make him a better driver?", "YTA.  Yes, you were within your rights to ask for insurance information, but since they were willing to pay out of pocket this wasn\u2019t about trying to get your car fixed, you were looking to be punitive. \n\nIf it is that important to you to go through insurance, you could have just taken the license plate number and then submitted the matter to your own insurer to handle.

Last year, I was in a fender bender and the lady wanted to pay out of pocket as well. We exchanged contact information, as well as insurance just in case.

You mentioned at the end \"trying to get their son to unnecessarily pay more than he needs to\" so you acknowledge  that you are simply choosing to take the low road.

He's offering the cash to do so.\n\nYou know what happened last time a teen rolled into me at a stop sign?  They got one heck of a lecture about being careful. That's it.", "Question for anyone who knows because I'm genuinely curious. If he accepted the money and then it turned out there was more damage (or maybe the amount they paid still wasn't enough to cover the damage they saw), would he be liable for paying the difference?

It sounds like the damage was all cosmetic and there was no structural damage. \n\nAl I can say is what goes around comes around. Many years ago I lightly tapped someone\u2019s bumper. She told me not to worry about it. A year or so later a friend\u2019s husband did the same to my car. I told him not to worry about it.

The kid was understandably terrified and asked me to let him Venmo me the money to fix it so it wouldn\u2019t increase his insurance. He showed me his bank account and he had more than enough to pay for it but I told him no anyway. I thought he would be more careful in the future if he had to pay more a month in insurance. I told him to show me his insurance information so I could call and make a claim. He refused because he could pay out of pocket and he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an insurance increase. I started to get irritated because this could\u2019ve been easier if he made it easier. He called his parents and told them about the accident. We waited for them to come so they could look at the damages. When they saw it wasn\u2019t bad they also wanted him to pay out of pocket. His parents also refused to exchange insurance so I got the police involved to get their information. When the officer got here I told him what happened and how they refused to exchange information then he told me they didn\u2019t have to since the damages were minor and they\u2019re willing to pay out of pocket. I cursed out the parents and they called me an asshole for trying to get their son to unnecessarily pay more money than he needs to. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We had a fender bender the weekend after Christmas and the cop told us that. Anything under $1k doesn't have to be reported.

For me it was the first time I drove on the freeway by myself. I thought I was braking appropriately, but I misjudged the amount of time it would take to come from freeway speeds to a stop. I rear-ended the nicest little old lady, and she was very sweet and understanding about it, but that was almost 30 years ago and I can still \\*viscerally\\* feel those moments between realizing the car wasn't going to stop in time and impact. It was only like a single second, but I totally remember noticing her disabled placard during that second.

Sometimes when you give someone a chance they can surprise you.", "You still have his name and plates.", "This was my thought reading this too but the way they handled the situation makes them a complete AH.

When I took it in for repair, the bumper had buckled in and then popped back out in such a way that I couldn't see it, but it needed to be replaced.

There is nothing wrong with going through the insurance, and keeping a proper paper trail of anything happening. \n\nBefore you know it, the kids parents accuse you of extortion, since there is no visible damage. Each party deals with their own insurance after you get each others insurance information and the professionals deal with the aftermath.", "Who knows, OP was given $500 anyway by his own admission and if the Police are telling him to drop it, it's pretty telling that OP is the one being an ass here and the matter is resolved. He called the cops so he can request a report, and collect insurance later if damages end up being more but literally nobody involved including OP believes that to be the case.", "Seems like an entirely related issue, especially from the kid's perspective.", "Except that your insurance rates then jack up. So exchange info, get some estimates & then they can pay the shop direct. If they don\u2019t want to pay, then go through insurance. In this instance, it seems like they could afford to do so. OP didn\u2019t have to accept any money on the spot.", "You're missing the point. \n\nUnless a mechanic has looked at it, you don't know how much it will cost to repair. Cosmetic damage is shockingly expensive to fix at a body shop. \n\nAnd that's why the kid, his parents, and the police officer are assholes. OP should have received an estimate and been reimbursed for the full repair instead of unqualified individuals making an uninformed assumption.", "I am not missing the point though? OP can still go to a mechanic and if the quote is more than what he got paid he can call his insurance, get his police report and go through those channels. You don't need to exchange insurance with other drivers if the police show up, they collect from everyone. But OP again feels his damage is more than paid for, BY HIS OWN ADMISSION he just wants to punish the kid lol so not sure why you are so adamantly defending him.", "How do you know there was a police report? I have had cops refuse to write one becasue there were no injuries (but the car was totaled).", "You still have to provide the other driver with your drivers license  and proof of insurance.   In Ontario its an offense to refuse to disclose to the other driver.  When police show up they'll have you exchange info and then they do their report and lay any charges either on scene or after their report is done.  It doesn't matter how major or minor the accident appears to be at the time.    I had a driver hit me and the damage looked small, when I took it to the mechanic all of the sensors on that side and a ton of other things needed to be replaced. It ended up being $2500.   Good luck getting the information from someone after they drive away.  \n\nFail to disclose particulars of insurance\n\nSet Fine: N.S.F.\n\nAn operator of a motor vehicle on a highway who is directly or indirectly involved in an accident shall, on the request of any person directly or indirectly involved in the accident, disclose to the person the particulars of the contract of automobile insurance insuring the motor vehicle.", "Have you gone through insurance claims before?\n\nWhen you go through your own insurance, the first thing you do is pay the deductible out of YOUR OWN pocket.   Then, after insurance pursues the other driver's insurance and they settle, you will get your deductible back. \n\nSo basically OP would be out of pocket for that deductible for 4-6 months. \n\nFuck that noise.  If someone hits my car I'm not going out of pocket for $5.\n\nI don't care what his reasoning is; insurance is there for a reason.

OP did not mention there not being a report, just that he wasn't owed the other party's insurance, which is true.", ">You still have to provide the other driver with your drivers license and proof of insurance. \n\nThis is literally not true everywhere.
