Why not tell them to grovel and apologize to A?", "Oh no, not the being told how disappointed they are in someone punishment. That\u2019s so rough. /s\n\nYou guys suck as a family.", "\u201cOh no! That was naughty! Well, good thing you produced offspring that we can focus on\u201d \n\nWhat have you done to support your wronged sister?", "Why in heaven\u2019s name are your sister and her affair partner even being invited to these family dinners? And YTA.", "You want A to apologize to D, yet D runs off with the life A HAD. They should AT THE VERY LEAST apologize, preferably never show their faces to A again, while A supported by her family.", "Wow... just... wow... the fact you are arguing so strongly to maintain your victimhood when your sister was cheated on with your other sister... why did you make the post. You told your sister to get over it... despite the fact that EVERY family function she will he reminded of her ex husbands betrayal and the child that resulted from it. Im glad your sister has gone NC, nobody in your family has any empathy besides the empty 'we are disappointed in you' platitudes. You did the absolute bare minimum to try and damage control the situation.\n\nYour sister went from happily married, to her entire family basically telling her, 'play nice.' If something this life changing happens to you, how would you feel to be told 'suck it up buttercup'.", "Cut them off.", "Look bro every person here has told you YTA , you don\u2019t get to dictate you sister feelings and tell her how she should handle a situation like this , you have no idea what it feel like to be betrayed by not only your partner but your sister your family some who\u2019s supposed to be there no matter what and you think she should just brush those things to the side so your not uncomfortable? \n\nImagine how uncomfortable she is having to be around them and you ! Because you obviously don\u2019t understand what type of line you sister crossed here. It\u2019s really sad that she the ones being alienated and made to feel like she\u2019s  wrong because she didn\u2019t just get over this heartbreak and betrayal from her family and has to be constantly reminded about it at every family event. It\u2019s sad that you said that your sister ,it\u2019s sad you expect her to want to be close to a child that was made from one of the worse times in her life! It\u2019s sad and disgusting that after everything everyone has said to you you\u2019re still trying to find some way to justify yourself and your other sisters disgusting actions.!! YTA I hope your sister finds happiness away from anyone who doesn\u2019t understand her pain.", "Well, i hope someday you get a fianc\u00e9, that will cheat on you with either A or D (yeah, D). We'll see then, how your tune will change.", "How about wrap your sister in a blanket of love and support and ice out the awful fucking cheaters?", "Not attend the wedding. No, I'm sure you even expected A to attend", "So instead you exiled the one who was cheated on? Disgusting and shameful.", "Did D apologize and beg for A\u2019s forgiveness in a  sincere manner?? Not that it would make a huge difference, sleeping with your sisters husband is borderline evil.", "You\u2019re soooo disappointed you welcomed the affair couple with open arms and shunned the victim of the affair.", "Where are you from? Because this is not the norm nor is it ok in most places. Your attitude is really crappy.", "The fact that you want her to get over it so YOU can stop feeling uncomfortable is the biggest thing here. It\u2019s not about her healing and \u201cgetting over it\u201d, you want her to make you feel better. You are the miserable one.", "Oh she won't be a miserable presence in those dinners anymore. \n\nCause she won't be attending them again \ud83d\ude02", "Well you can\u2019t have both. There\u2019s no way she\u2019s ever going to be ok with this, and your expectation that she would be is wild.

Sounds like she made her choice, though", "You kind of got your wish, since she cut contact with all of you you won't have to face her being \"such a miserable presense at family dinner\".", "You need therapy", "You don't have any say in who your sister has in her life. It's NOT YOUR BUSINESS.", "OP, Maybe the same thing needs to happen to you so you understand her pain.", "Well, if you want her to stop being \"such a miserable presense (sic)\" you got your wish; sounds like she's cut you all of her life, which is probably for the best, so she can find people who won't betray her or harass her for feeling hurt and betrayed by people who were supposed to love her. \n\nMission successful!", "Now since went NC you won't have her presence at your family dinners.", "No worries, sounds like she won\u2019t be a presence at all in your lives anymore. Good for her, vile people like your family deserve to be crabs in a bucket.", "Literally everything you keep saying is just further proving you and your family are the assholes.", "Holy shit you are so wildly TA (and your whole family other then your poor sister sucks).   \n\nHow dare she inconvenience all of you by not being overjoyed at having to spend every family visit with her cheating ex and the sister who was fucking her own husband behind her back for who knows how long?\n\nThis shit is so cruel I\u2019m choosing to believe you\u2019re trolling, because no way everyone in a family could be this horrible.", "Maybe she wouldn't be so miserable if her family weren't such selfish assholes who don't care about her feelings at all. I'm glad she cut you off. Both you and your other sister are toxic and you have both made it clear that you don't really care about her. She's better off without you.", "Ugh you are being horrible. Good on A for cutting out ALL the family that completely betrayed her.", "Well good thing she's cut you guys off then. This way you won't experience her... misery", "What is wrong with you? Seriously. The victim in this situation (which is your sister, by the way) doesn\u2019t need to make amends. The BIL and cheating sister do. Take your complaints to them.

You\u2019re insane and so is your family. I\u2019m glad A got out.", "Ignoring the child isn\u2019t abusing her.  Face it, you ALL know you are a shitty acting family and wanted her to excuse you.  You didn\u2019t want her to be a miserable presence at family dinners anymore and you got your wish.  Congratulations on being as crappy of a brother as your AP sister, your sister A is going to soar without y\u2019all trashing her self esteem.", "And she doesn't owe that child shit, even if she had the best relationship with those two. So what is your fucking point? That child is not the problem, you and your fucked up family are and you're in denial or just evil. I'd bet my kidney on the second.", "How dumb and blind can you be? Every single response you are defending the cheating.", "And nobody said that it is.\n\nShe isn't hurting the child. She just chose to not be part of their family because the parents betrayed and deliberately hurt her. Nothing wrong with her ignoring the child.", "You're not thinking clearly. You're so focused on yourself and thinking \"me me me!\" It's not about you. Did you even stand up for A? I bet you didn't. Use your brain for 2 seconds here. Trying to force A to have any type of relationship with the affair baby will hurt both of them. Stop being selfish. Try to find some sympathy for your sister. Which I doubt you can do because you clearly don't care about A in the slightest. You're evil. Plain and simple.", "That\u2019s not the argument you think it is. Repeating that isn\u2019t going to make you NTA", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not the baby\u2019s fault but that doesn\u2019t erase the hurt that your niece represents. Your sister is not obligated to have a relationship with her niece when she was betrayed by the niece\u2019s parents. Your sister doesn\u2019t have to let bygones be bygones. Your sister is within her rights to cut the cheaters and the affair child (niece) out of her life.", "And it's not your sisters responsibility to make sure you're not uncomfortable at family dinners. Your sister can make whatever decisions she wants, which includes protecting her peace by not having a relationship with her niece which is a by-product of the affair that ended her marriage and her relationship with her sister.\n\nIt BLOWS my mind how you can sit here and defend your sister D and not your sister A. \n\nWhile I would usually never wish anyone to be cheated on by their husband, and especially not with someone they know, like a sister, it sounds like you have ZERO empathy for your sister, so I do hope that one day you can understand the PAIN she is going through, so that you will realize how horrible of a person you are.", "A isn't doing anything to hurt your niece. She isn't unkind to her or nasty - she has taken herself out of the situation entirely and that is very wise of her.", "And she doesn\u2019t have to have a relationship with the parents who caused deep, irreparable harm. Or the rest of the family who think her pain doesn\u2019t matter", "Dude. Just stop.", "So if you had a wife and your wife cheated on you with your brother had a baby with your now ex wife you would be ok with that? You would just hug it out and be a happy person? Like be sooo for real right now. That\u2019s fine if your family still want to be in the life of your other sister and niece however don\u2019t try to force your other sister too. You keep saying she is hurting the family but she is family and was hurt by a family member so how is she hurting the family when a family member hurt her first?", "Thats not a reason to have a relationship with someone.", "That doesn't make you and your family not assholes.", "And the entire situation isn't A's fault yet she's being punished and forced to attend such gatherings.", "That child is a product of an affair that HURT your sister. Why don\u2019t you care about her?", "Great, and \u201cthat child\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean anything to her. If you love the kid and want to spend time with them, great. But \u201cthat child\u201d represents a whole hell of a lot more to her and you are unwilling to accept her boundaries.", "She may be your niece but not your sisters. You and your family have zero empathy.", "Bridges have been burned, but A was not the one who started the fire. \n\nA doesn't have an obligation on \"that child.\"", "Again, AND?!? Is she supposed to give a fuck? I'm glad she cut contact with all of you because you are honestly monsters and selfish beyond reason.", "Yes!! A reminder of her family betrayal.. she doesn\u2019t have to interact with none of those people.. it\u2019s a sad situation for your niece because when that little girl grows up and finds out how her parents got together she will have some type of trauma for sure.. your other sister didn\u2019t think of the long term consequences of her selfish actions.", "It's also the affair baby your sister's husband had with your OTHER SISTER. WHILE HE WAS MARRIED TO YOUR SISTER.\n\nWere you raised by wolves? What is wrong with your family that you all think this is okay and the betrayed person is the one who is causing problems and not the two cheaters? This is wild.", "Why are you only invested in the emotions of everyone in your family except those of your sister A? \n\nI wouldnt care if \"That Child\" was the second coming of christ. You have absurd expectations of others.", "And your sister is your sister but you don't seem to give two shits about her.", "No she isn't. She is your niece she is not your sister's! Your sister is allowed to choose her own family especially when her \"biological\" family are cupid stunts.", "Your freaking niece is the product of an affair and a constant reminder of how crappy her first husband and sister are as people", "And this right here tells us everything we need to know.  You replaced A with your niece.\n\nWho was conceived because your SISTER FUCKED HER SISTER\u2019S HUSBAND.\n\nYTA.  Your BIL is the AH.  And D is the AH.  I\u2019m throwing your parents in as AH for good measure, as they chose which daughter they cared about - the one who HAD AN AFFAIR BABY.\n\nNot the sister who was wronged.  A is the only non-asshole in this story.  And the affair baby.", "*Niece\n\nAnd sadly, that's what she is.", "That\u2019s what she is\u2026 \ud83d\ude2d yta", "That's what she is. Like it or not. And it's your sister and that being you call BIL that bear all the fault here. The fact that you put all of this situation on your sister says a lot about you. Hopefully she can move on from people like you and find someone who cares about her and won't throw her under the bus because they'd rather not admit how selfish and evil they are like you and your family.", "It\u2019s the truth", "Doesn\u2019t change that fact that she is.\n\nI hope you find love and have it ripped away from someone you trusted. Maybe than you will know how it feels", "Your niece is an affair baby.", "Sorry but that what happened. They had an affair and nine months later surprise.", "She's an affair baby. You like it or not. And you are a huge  YTA. It's crazy how you cant see it.", "Why not? A married man had an affair with his wife\u2019s sister that resulted in a baby. Those are terrible people and why would you want that in your life? What happens when your BIL cheats on this sister?", "Would you prefer bastard child?", "That\u2019s what she is. That\u2019s what they made her.", "But unfortunately, that\u2019s what she is. And it really stinks that she had two parents so selfish that they put her in this position, but often the innocent are collateral damage from the consequences of the guilty. The fault is entirely the husband and D\u2019s, who sound like utterly awful people.\n\nETA: you do realize you\u2019ll probably never know the nieces and nephews you get through A, right?", "That\u2019s what she is.", "Because then OP and the grandparents wouldn\u2019t have contact with the baby.", "Massachusetts.", "You\u2019re a miserable presence on this sub. And by the looks of it, the parents didn\u2019t do a good job with ANY of you besides A. I wish her well.", "We have YET to see you take up for your sister. Karma is nasty. You better hope nothing happens to you. Then you have to love with seeing your pain every single day. Oh and your family thinks you should get over it.", "I\u2019m ashamed to know you\u2019re from my state if this is how you and your family treats another family member.", "You're the Masshole."]}
