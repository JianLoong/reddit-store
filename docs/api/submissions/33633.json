They almost always make them worse. Having less autonomy, sleepless nights, higher financial burden, and higher home life stress usually doesn't bring people together", "Maybe a rouge shout here, but I think NTA. This sounds so unhealthy and toxic.. A baby shouldn't be brought into a relationship as a 'saviour'. Cannot begin to imagine the resentment that is to follow if she goes ahead with this. I think I would have said exactly the same.", "NTA.  You told her what most people would tell anybody they love under the same circumstances. It\u2019s not fair to a baby either to be expected or hoped to be able to mend a marriage. I think just the thought of wanting to try to have a baby to save a marriage is proof it\u2019s over. Like trapping the spouse attempt to not flee because of a baby on the way.", "NTA\n\nThere might not be a lot you can actually do here, as people in your sister\u2019s position are generally going to do whatever they do regardless of any advice, but you responded honestly and were likely correct on all points.  Having a child to save a relationship is always, always a completely terrible idea, and that\u2019s before you take finances etc into account - hopefully your sister sees sense and if not, at least you tried.", "NTA.\n\nA baby NEVER makes marital problems go away. It\u2019s actually the opposite. Whatever problems were there before are usually made worse by the stress of being parents.", "NTA - children are gifts in the form of wrecking balls to one\u2019s life, so while perhaps tying the two of them together legally for several years, a sudden baby will work against her in terms of him figuring out his feelings for her. Besides, as it\u2019s one of the oldest methods of entrapment in the book, he\u2019ll know what she did and why, which adds to the chances of things not going how she intended.\n\nHonestly, her best bet to save her marriage is, quite honestly, her ability to have some self respect and start moving on. Marriage counseling is a good first step, but she needs to understand what she\u2019s worth and, depending on what has gone on in the relationship, be clear that she doesn\u2019t deserve being in limbo with someone willing to treat her this way. While unfortunate, some folks only respond to being \u201chard to get,\u201d but few people will give you respect if you don\u2019t have any for yourself. \n\nShe\u2019s way too young (I\u2019ve reinvented myself multiple times in the 15 years between our ages) to tie herself in knots for someone on the fence. It\u2019s entirely possible things are over and that\u2019s really hard, but life is about living and there are so many other adventures around the bend. \n\n(I\u2019m hopped up on coffee and talking to myself through this as well\u2026 thus the overbearing TEDtalk.)", "NTA. Kids should never be born with a job. Now when her marriage doesn\u2019t magically heal itself, it will be the child\u2019s fault. Kids always find a way to blame themselves when their parents fight - why bring one into a situation where that\u2019s already happening?", "NTA but your sister is going to do what she wants regardless. You are absolutely right, and it is a terrible burden to put on a little baby that they were only brought into this world to make their dad stay with their mum. It also rarely works.", "NTA. I was a \"save the marriage\" baby. It didn't work and my parents divorced when I was 2. Never known my parents together and they always hated each other and I was a burden they would pass off to one another. She is sentencing that child to a miserable life", "NTA\n\nIt is **cruel** to summon a little human into an already unstable family. And it's putting that tiny person into a family Savior role.\n\nBesides, babies ADD stress to even the happiest marriages -- SIL already has a small child to think about.", "NTA. Because you and everyone around her will be stuck with the fallout of her bad decisions.", "NTA\n\nHaving a child is not the way to salvage a relationship. You have a child because and when you have a strong relationship, not to build one. Your sister is asking for disaster and that's just unfair and cruel to the child because it didn't ask to be brought into this world, yet it would suffer from your sisters dumb decision. \n\nIs your BIL even on board or is she doing it behind his back?", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately it can make things even worse. She should sit down and really think things through.", "NTA\u2026 more people need to hear that. Selfish to bring children into the world cos your scared of your partner leaving", "Nta but I would go a step further and talk to your BIL and maybe mention it. You don\u2019t have to say sis is looking to baby trap him but I think just making sure he doesn\u2019t want another kid and he\u2019s always using protection and not letting her handle it.  \n\nIt would be a cruel selfish thing for her to do that", "NTA \n\nBabies don\u2019t save marriages. \n\nYour sister and her husband should seek out marriage AND individual counseling before they entertain the idea of bringing a child into this world. It\u2019s selfish for them to do anything but this.", "My youngest f sib used to have a friend, I'll call her Annie. Annie had a bf, I'll call him Wesley. Annie was infatuated with Wesley, but after Annie got pregnant, Wesley quickly revealed his lack of interest with staying in the relationship. Annie learned that Wesley wanted to leave so Annie, being the \"genius\" that she was, told f sib she plans to \"trap\" Wesley by having another kid... she had twins. Now Wesley's gone and she's a single mother... good luck to your sister.", "NTA - A \u201csave the marriage baby\u201d\nnever works out for anyone", "NAH she\u2019s in a panic fog and not thinking clearly at all.", "Info: In which tone did you say that? This could be extremely rude or extremely considerate", "YTA. If your sister wants another baby, that\u2019s her business. Not yours. You don\u2019t have to endorse the idea. But unless she explicitly asked for your opinion, you just shit all over what she wants unsolicited. Did she ask you to help raise it?  Did she ask you for money to support it?  Did she ask for your eggs or for you to be the surrogate?

That is a DREADFUL reason to get pregnant and would basically be setting up the baby as a child of divorce.", "It was good advice which sister probably  won\u2019t take because she\u2019s already decided to get pregnant again and if her husband is dumb enough to fall for this,  or wsnts another kid but doesn\u2019t love his wife, baby number two will be on their way. At which point husband will probably file for a divorce. Sister wants to have a sibling for her child and with the same dad, close together in age which all other things being equal would be a great idea however all other things are NOT equal- dad wants out.  and trying to baby trap him into staying because she can\u2019t work full time with two young kids and the child and spousal support for him would be a burden that might make him stay. \nBut the two kids will then be raised in a home with a big power imbalance  and resentment and probably ugly fighting noises, possibly cheating, etc. \nit\u2019s just not worth it.\nFix what is broken before you have another child.", "NTA, tell her you're sorry that you hurt her but she is your sister and you are telling her the truth out of love for her. You understand she's afraid of losing her marriage and desperate for a solution, but a baby is not a solution, it's a human life. Children tend to develop the ability to form healthy attachments by age 3, so even just an early childhood in a turbulent marriage where the stress impacts caregiver responsiveness can affect them for the rest of their lives if you're not careful.\n\n\nIf she is still thinking about getting pregnant, ask how she envisions this going in the best case scenario. I assume it's something like she gets pregnant, he loves the baby so much that he becomes certain that he does love her. All the problems that led them to this point go away and they live happily ever after. Then ask her how realistic that is\n\n\n\nNext, try to get her to look at this situation from her potential baby's perspective. Ask her what she thinks it would it be like to be born with a job as big as saving your parents marriage? Try to get her to tell you what she thinks, because that's more impactful than a lecture but for some prompts: \n\n-What would it be like for that child to grow up in a home where dad isn't sure he loves mum, but feels pressured to stay around because the baby needs him? \n\n-What if dad resents the baby for keeping him in a marriage he doesn't want? \n\n-What would it be like for this child if mum experiences post-natal depression since dad is disconnected emotionally because he doesn't know if he loves her? \n\n-What would the child experience if mum begins to resent feeling unsupported in raising them, and the marriage is still on the rocks? \n\n-What happens to the child if they divorce, if dad never really wanted them and mum knows they were only born to save a marriage but failed?\n\n-How would life be for the child when mum has to work long hours to support them but they're still poor?\n\n-What if they rarely see dad because he never really wanted them?", "NTA.

You were right to tell her what you thought, as you are right that a new baby would only make her situation and relationship worse even in the best case scenario. I can understand why she asked though; she wants to cling to her relationship with her husband, and its a natural instinct to try and form a new bridge between them. The fact that she not only asked for your advice, but didn't lash out when you gave her an answer she didn't want makes me say no assholes here."]}
