Ended up looking down a balcony wondering if I should jump. Leave and find happiness. Congrats on the new job!", "NTA\n\nThe only way you could possibly be an asshole in this situation is if leaving would violate your contract (eg, if there's some sort of clause stating you have to work there for a certain amount of time). I doubt any contract you might have signed with this call center has such a contract, as that sort of clause is usually reserved for jobs where training is costly/extensive. Plus, places like call centers typically account for ridiculous turnover rates anyway, so you're not really leaving them with too many problems. Obligatory, I'm not a Lawyer, that was not legal advice.\n\nFor any given job, I would look at it from the other side: It's not your job to stay, it's their job to retain you. If you find a better job, normally moving to that job will only ever benefit you.", "NTA\n\nyou aren't a slave. you don't have to stay there. \n\nWhilst it's nice of you, remember this: they won't be loyal to you. If they need to cut people, they won't hesistate. \n\nDon't stay miserable in a job you hate because of misguided loyalty.", "NTA. Keeping a job out of desperation or, even worse, for thinking YWBTA for leaving it after a day, half a day, a few hours or half an hour is only going to be detrimental for you in the long run. A call center job is not for everyone in the sense that you have to make yourself invulnerable to people's frustrations and have to learn to not take a thing personal; if it's not for you, it isn't. Look after yourself and good luck with your new job!", "NTA , not only have you only worked 3 shifts there, you are under no obligation to continue at a job you aren't interested in and don't need", "NTA. These phoners are the bane of my life. Well, not literally, but ... Kudos to you for finding a productive job!", "NTA at all?! You gotta put you first!", "NTA \u2014 not sure what the exact terms of your employment are, but if you\u2019re an at will employee you\u2019re free to leave. You can put in two weeks if you want but it\u2019s not an obligation.", "NTA. Sounds like that would be a horrible job. No sense in sticking out something that will just make you miserable", "NTA. The job isn't the right fit for you, and quite frankly sounds like a nightmare. Give notice and move on.", "NTA - I've worked in telemarketing, and it SUCKS! I even had a cool boss, who helped me sell and I got to be pretty good at it, but that doesn't change the fact that the work sucks. There's a reason that the industry has such a high turnover. Good for you for getting out while you're still sane.", "NTA alot of people have been in this position probation period at a job should work both ways.", "NTA\n\nIt's a call center.  No one will die if you just walk away from this job.  \n\nTrust me, all the employees there are interchangeable cogs, as far as the company and bosses are concerned.\n\nGo find a job that makes you happy, and don't worry about it.  A handful of surveys left unasked won't harm anyone.", "NTA. Call center jobs suck", "NTA, \n\nIf this is the States. A good majority of jobs are At-Will. Unless there is a contract or certain stipulations of a job. You can leave whenever you want for whatever you want.

Call centers get you a pass even if you decided to No Call/No Show in my opinion.", "NTA at all.\n\nI hate getting those calls.   \n\nRecently we've been getting calls at 6:30 & 7:30a.m.    \n\nIt takes me a bit to get to the phone, so it rings like four-five times.    The whole house gets woken up.  (Old AT&T monster)  \n\nI went off on the guy asking him why he thinks it's okay to call at 6:30 in the fucking morning?   Oof.   I did feel bad afterwards.   But *really?  6:30?  \n\nThey'll just replace you and you'll be having a better time at the sporting goods store.  \n\nDon't even bother to add the call center on your resume.", "NTA. I took a call center job knowing I wouldn\u2019t stay because it had several weeks of paid training - that I used to continue job hunting. Got offered another job just days before my first day on the actual phones. Called out \u201cI\u2019m quitting effective immediately\u201d because I wanted to be re-hireable just in case (wouldn\u2019t have been if I no call/no showed)\u2026got called the next two days in a row asking where I was for my shift and had to explain I already quit following proper call out protocol. Trust me, they won\u2019t miss you.", "NTA- this is part of growing up. Doing menial work is one thing, but no one should have to be spoken to like that at work. Don\u2019t feel bad, they will sucker someone else in for the job and they won\u2019t give you a second thought.", "NTA, leaving a crappy call center job is actually a service to humanity. If possible, leave in the middle of a shift on a busy day.", "You are absolutely right, they suck.", "Thank you very much! I hope you have found a better job, and are out of that mindset! < 3", "You're right. The employee handbook says that they ask employees to stay for a minimum of 2 weeks in order to really experience the job and understand the position, but just after 3 shifts, I understand it fully. It's just repetitive calls.", "Okay great. That was kind of what I was worried about as well, of course, I do not want to leave them struggling to find workers for the shifts I was supposed to have, but I really do not think it is a good idea to keep doing the calls, it gets very tiring!", "Let me tell you, it is so miserable. The worst is when I have to call people who are 90+ years old, I feel so bad when I do that.", "Thanks for the advice, and you are right, it is a nightmare!", "The work really does suck. I hate cold calling with a passion now that I have been in the industry, and I really feel bad for the people we call", "That's what I was thinking. And I mean I really do hate the whole idea of the surveys, these people aren't asking to be called, their numbers are just being pulled from different places.", "You are absolutely right!", "I am in Canada! I tried to look into the laws and whatnot, and it gave the 2 weeks notice speech. I would rather just not work anymore shifts and just be done completely with them.", "Although I have never received any of the cold calls, I really understand the frustration when people get mad over the phone. I have already woken up numerous people and always feel so bad!!", "I see exactly what you mean. They have a lot, like 200 hundred agents at all times so I don't know how much they really would miss me. And plus it's all remote so I haven't met anyone so it's a little easier.", "If they have to put something in their handbook begging people to stay at least two weeks, you know for sure that at least 90% of the people hired hate the job and quit in far less than two weeks.\n\nIf they were good employers, they wouldn't need to beg people to stay for two weeks, people would be happy to work for them.\n\nGet out of there and don't look back.", "If that's not in a contract you signed, you're not bound to those two weeks. I guarantee you almost 90% of everyone who comes in there leaves the second those two weeks are over, anyway.", "I can imagine over the long run it would start to affect your emotional and mental health. You're making the right decision. Don't be too surprised when you give notice if they don't terminate you on the spot. Boiler room outfits like that typically do.", "You aren't a slave, you are a free /u/slapthatwafle damn it! Be free. You aren't doomed to the call center.", "Congratulations!   You're a good person!", "That is what I was thinking as well! I can\u2019t imagine doing it for the whole school year.", "I have to spread my wings!!"]}
