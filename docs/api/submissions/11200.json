Sometimes we have discussions about countries she had visited and would start making insensitive comments mainly about third world countries, how she feels bad for them, how they\u2019re dirty, dangerous etc. I was horrified, speechless and was starting to get uncomfortable\n\nNow the icing on the cake is that MIL wanted to take me out for a birthday dinner. She constantly goes on crazy diets, it\u2019s always difficult to chose a place that can cater to her. \n\nDuring dinner, she didn\u2019t even eat her meal, all she did was talk about herself and I politely just engaged in the conversation.

Also, I can leave the U.S. I just won\u2019t be able to enter if I leave before immigration clearance.\n\nFrom there I just stopped talking to her, at home i would be in my bedroom and my husbands home office to avoid breaking down or becoming emotional. MIL got upset that I was not talking to her.\n\nToday, MIL got involved in an argument I had with my husband. I told her that I was not comfortable and honestly scared to be around her without doing something she doesn\u2019t like or her making racist comments. Out of anger, I told her she was a spoilt, racist woman. She responds with \u201dI would not have allowed you to marry my son if I was racist, maybe you\u2019re the racist one\u201d.\n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t even think of her as a mum because of what she has been saying around me and she responds with \u201cI never asked you to call me mum, you\u2019re not my daughter, I only have a son\u201d. I had mentioned all the other things she had said in the past and all I could get out of her is that I\u2019m making it up or taking it out of context.

You are taking everything so personally, if there are comments you don't like speak up and have an adult conversation.......If you make food she does not want, just tell her she can make her own, set boundaries.   You don't just stop talking to someone without any conversation, you are living with this person who is contributing to your family all because your feelings got hurt.  Grow up, and stop being selfish to your husband and his mother, you chose to move in......so understand there are more people in the home than you!", "YTA\n\nI can only go by what you have as examples, and how you listed the examples. So here they are -\n\nFirst, her comments you say are racist seem to me to be socioeconomic based, not race based, and frankly what you are describing as specifics center around measurable differences that are objective, surrounding crime rates, public utilities, public services, etc. *You can look many of these things up on the internet and see countries ranked against each other.* That isn\u2019t racism. It is socioeconomic facts. Extremely poor countries tend to have higher crime rates, lower/poorer performing public utilities, harder times getting access to decent housing, food, or clean water. Facts are facts.\n\nYou may not have liked your mother in law pointing out that you had things to do in order to leave the country, **but you later in your post say yourself that she was accurate.**\n\nYou may not like that your mother in law finds certain aromas stinky, but such is life. I can\u2019t stand smelling Brussel sprouts being cooked, it\u2019s a running joke with my wife and I. \n\nBottom line is you seem to want some idyllic relationship and interaction with her, and it isn\u2019t happening. Meet her where she is, and develop the relationship you can with the person that she is.", "She was racist in my eyes the moment she started calling food she wasn't used to weird/smelly/unhealthy. it went downhill from there.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand what was racist to being with. If I try and read it, objectively, the mother in law said\u2026.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for the people living in XXX that I recently visited (third world countries). It is so dangerous compared to here. It seems so dirty compared to here.\u201d\n\nCrime rates. Clean water. Availability of decent housing. Availability of food. Educational opportunities. Public services. These are all very real differences, objectively measurable differences, between countries. \n\nGiven that these differences exist (they do) and what MIL talked about could very well be accurate, first hand experiences *for third world countries she had visited*, and further **not tied to a race but rather a socioeconomic comparison**, how is it racist?", "i sent a picture of all the tomatoes at my fully stocked local fruit and veg shop and sent it to my friends in the uk for a laugh. Seriously im in ireland and we aren't having these issues anyone that believes the nonsense of it being due to whether in spain is an idiot.", "I'd say try Lidl and Aldi they normally have them in when the bigger supermarkets don't.", "No tomatoes!?! That's so sad!", "Wait! What!? Where did your tomatoes go?", "This is a case of a word/term having an original mean that is merely a technical fact but its use as an insult has become so wide spread odds are it is only ever used as an insult and most people have forgotten the original meaning. \n\nThough it might be a fun trivia question 'based on the original meaning of third world name one of the third world countries in europe' potential answers could be Ireland, Switzerland, Finland and Sweden as non were members of nato (finland and sweden are trying to join) when third world was used in this way.", "Particularly because depending on the visa type it\u2019s very hard to leave", "Short answer: Brexit.\n\nLong answer: Bbbbbbbrrrrrrreeeeeeeexxxxxxxxiiiiiiiiittttttt", "NTA. I'm glad your husband has witnessed the things that his mother has said and how they affect you. She seems pretty clueless and thinks everything about her is fine. I hope you and your husband can get far enough away from her to live your married life on your own terms.", "NTA, but your husband is.", "Um... sorry. British food is nasty. Oh wait, not sorry, it is. And I am white as are majority of Brits... so I guess insulting food that is gross to you is not racist. It is not xenophobic either. Love British people and culture. But that is the absolute last place (and maybe Scotland is it with haggis?) That I would want to go on a food tour of.", "I agree. Acknowledging that some place has a lot of problems that they DO have is not racist. Insulting the people who live there would be racist. IE calling the people dirty (insert race or nationality here). Versus saying the places she visited were very dirty with trash everywhere and polluted rivers.", "I thought it was all to do with the cold weather in Spain \ud83d\ude02 though brexit doesn\u2019t surprise me", "NTA I loved it when my husband worked in Birmingham. I used to hope and pray we would get invited to a 'do' by one of his work colleagues who had an Asian background. The food, OMG the food, home cooked by some incredibly skilled Aunty. I'm salivating with the thought of tables heaving under the gorgeous varieties of genuine Asian recipes. The wonderful clothes, the fabulous dancing. Your MIL does not know gorgeous food when she sees and smells it. She is narrow minded and rascist.", "NTA you should definitely get out of that house. I assume it belongs to your MIL? Your husband needs to stop paying the mortgage on that house and buy one for you both or rent an apartment. Either way get out of there.", "NTA. MIL is a racist pig.", "NTA. She wanted you out. Done. She just thought her son would stay. Your move.", "Nta but I feel your husband isn\u2019t innocent in this. He should be taking a much stronger position in this argument because whatever she says about you will definitely be applied to future children if you decide to grow your family. Your husband really needs to take the lead against his mother and very sternly set boundaries and be ready to go LC for this.", "Once in a while a true hero rises.", "THAT'S NOT WHAT GASLIGHTING IS.", "Thanks for the humor thing.", "I mean shes not wrong, third world countries are like that.", "Good, we don\u2019t want your kind of bullshit here, especially not in Scotland. Arsehole."]}
