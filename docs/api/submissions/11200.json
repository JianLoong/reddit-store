We had been together for 3 years and married just last November 2022\n\nWe made the decision to marry and have me move to the U.S., I was relatively flexible as I can continue my studies + career anywhere  than to make my husband start his career again elsewhere. \n\nPrior to my moving, I had always thought that I had a good relationship with my Mother-in-law (MIL)\n\nIt is also good to mention that my husband technically pays for the mortgage of the house we currently live in and MIL pays for the bills. We planned to move out after a year or two.\n\nRecently, MIL has been making comments about the food my husband and I make, saying it\u2019s weird, smells, unhealthy, bad for you etc. Most of the time it is food that I am making (Asian or non western foods sometimes fried chicken). Sometimes we have discussions about countries she had visited and would start making insensitive comments mainly about third world countries, how she feels bad for them, how they\u2019re dirty, dangerous etc. I was horrified, speechless and was starting to get uncomfortable\n\nNow the icing on the cake is that MIL wanted to take me out for a birthday dinner. She constantly goes on crazy diets, it\u2019s always difficult to chose a place that can cater to her. \n\nDuring dinner, she didn\u2019t even eat her meal, all she did was talk about herself and I politely just engaged in the conversation. When she did stop talking, I had mentioned that a friend and I would like to go on a vacation once I can start travelling again. She instantly said well that\u2019s if you can leave the country\n\nIt made me feel stupid talking about it, this was supposed to be a birthday dinner. Also, I can leave the U.S. I just won\u2019t be able to enter if I leave before immigration clearance.\n\nFrom there I just stopped talking to her, at home i would be in my bedroom and my husbands home office to avoid breaking down or becoming emotional. MIL got upset that I was not talking to her.\n\nToday, MIL got involved in an argument I had with my husband. I told her that I was not comfortable and honestly scared to be around her without doing something she doesn\u2019t like or her making racist comments. Out of anger, I told her she was a spoilt, racist woman. She responds with \u201dI would not have allowed you to marry my son if I was racist, maybe you\u2019re the racist one\u201d.\n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t even think of her as a mum because of what she has been saying around me and she responds with \u201cI never asked you to call me mum, you\u2019re not my daughter, I only have a son\u201d. I had mentioned all the other things she had said in the past and all I could get out of her is that I\u2019m making it up or taking it out of context. My husband had tried multiple times to say that she had said those things but has refused to acknowledge them. \n\nI was told to get out of the house and not come back. So I\u2019m now at a hotel room with my husband, looking for a place to move to or thinking of going back to the U.K.", "created_utc": 1677663807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ezmpb/aita_for_calling_my_motherinlaw_a_spoilt_racist/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its kinda correct.  Whilst yes you can leave and are not hostage you wouldnt leave without getting clearance as you'd not be able to continue your married life and plans there. So what was racist about that - that it broke the camels back so to speak?\n\nAlso its true why would you even think of calling her mum as a DIL? Its not really her culture that you'd do that, she hasnt requested it, you dont have that sort of relationship. So her response is actually fine.\n\nThe rest are for sure racial micro-aggressions and down right offensive and make a person racist. I'm a Brit but not ethnically, and if someone called the food I ate offensive and made stupid comments about other countries out of ignorance - I'd have zero respect for them and not want to be around them. You're stuck as she is your husbands mother and you live near her and she pays the utilities.\n\nTell your husband its offensive to hear her talk about your food and about other countries like this  - it offends every cell in your body. So he has to decide what to do.\n\nEither you go no contact with her and he maintains his relationship with her - she doesnt come into the home, he sees her at her place or anywhere else. But if you do  have kids in the future - this isnt sustainable as you'd not want your kids around someone like that even if you dont need to see her.\n\nOr she apologises and doesnt speak like this to you ever again and you rebuild the relationship.\n\nOr you move a few hours away so she isnt there all the time and again he goes to visit her, not you and you dont rely on her for any bills so she has no hold over you.\n\nIf he cant see what she is doing is offensive then there is no point is there - go back to the UK. You cant live with a man who accepts this, and if you ever have kids they cant be hearing her disparage them and their background and mixed culture and feeling self hate.", "NTA.

I read what you said over and over again OP. I too am British asian. I can't see what your MIL did that is racist. I too have travelled to many less developed countries, some of them do feel more dangerous with more visible corruption and crime, and some are definitely dirtier because their governments haven't invested in the same levels of sanitation and they don't have clean water to drink from the tap. That isn't racist. As for the food, personally I love almost all food so I think she's missing out. But she's not just complaining about your food, also the food her son makes and also the food from a restaurant she was supposedly ok with. It sounds more like she has an eating disorder than is racist about food (is this even possible?). And what she said about you not being able to leave the country or it impacting your visa - is that not correct? I mean none of these things scream racism to me. What I have read just sounds like you are two very different women from two very different backgrounds, with different attitudes and behaviours and expectations of each other. She sounds difficult yes, but not racist. And you sound a little sensitive to be perfectly honest.", "Bring your husband to Britain we tend to be rather humour filled towards yanks!
