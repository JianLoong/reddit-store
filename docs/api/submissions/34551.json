The owner left me and the other neighbours his contact details as it's an investment property, and it's in case we wanted to make any complaints. 8 months ago, my neighbours got a dog. They still need to train the dog. I'm not a dog owner, and I know that dogs do bark, but one of the issues was this dog barked constantly day and night. The main issue is since they've got the dog, they've let him out to do a wee and poo every day, but they've never picked the dog poo up; their garden is literally covered in poo. The stench was so putrid that I went over on two separate occasions to have the same conversation, I asked them if they could pick up their dog poo as it stinks so bad I can't have my windows open often and if they could just train their dog, they weren't exactly thrilled about this but said they see what they could do about it. \n\nYes, it's wintertime, but although the smell has died down because of the cold, I can still smell it. As I've spoken to them on two separate occasions, I decided they would be the same for the third time. Sometime in December, I texted the owner of the property to make a complaint regarding the dog poo. I explained the situation to him, and he texted back and said he's finally given up and would be looking to evict them. He's explained that numerous residents have been contacting him and even sent photos of their garden. He's sent them warning letters and done everything he can to resolve the issue.

I'm someone who does stick up for myself and wasn't ashamed to say it was. They went home and had a rant on Facebook (An app I don't use).

Asked the owners nicely on two occasions, they didn't care. The dog was also never walked... I ended up moving after a year, not only because of this noise but it was a major factor.\n\nSounds like these people are neglecting their dog and neglecting the property. Their neglect has caused various kinds of nuisance including frequent/incessant dog barking (a statutory nuisance in the UK) and dog feces that are left out for a long time/never cleaned up causing smell (and possibly infection risk!). Also, this is neglect/abuse of the dog: ALL dogs need to be walked several times a day. And a barking dog is not a happy dog. Dogs shouldn't be left outside for long periods of time IF they bark (and if weather is cold/wet, they shouldn't be left outside for long at all whether they bark or not).\n\nYou have asked these people nicely on multiple occasions.

These people were a nuisance to the whole neighbourhood and rightly are now evicted. They had opportunities to improve but refused to/failed to act on the warning letters from the landlord. There's just one solution then, and it's eviction. They could easily have given up the dog if they couldn't care for it. If this was the main complaint, they'd probably not have been evicted had they gotten rid of the dog. They chose to have a dog they also chose to not care for, then this is what you get. Don't feel bad for people who behave like this, they will often have been evicted multiple times already or will in the future because they continue to behave in an unacceptable way.

Their landlord had already sent them notices about this. They chose not to do anything about it.", "NTA\n\nWe owned plenty of dogs in a rental property we were in for a long while when I was a kid. We let the dogs out three times a day and would clean up twice a day (the nighttime one being done in the morning along with the morning stuff). We also knew that pee can be acidic and therefore took it upon ourselves to make sure we fertilized the grass and took care of it if it was starting to go slightly off-color in spots. Our landlord was alright with certain spots not being kept up when it came to pee, because the previous tenants had let this ugly mass of weeds and crabgrass take over the lawn in that section. He was happy the dog pee was actually killing it without having to resort to harsh chemicals near the fruit trees on the property.  regardless, we took care of the lawn because we knew we had the dogs and we knew that it wasn't our property. If your neighbors were responsible about it, then they could have easily picked up the dog poop in the lawn immediately when it was done, especially if they were taking it outside with them; and they couldn't have easily invested in a simple hose attachment and gently rinsed the grass, or re-seeded which honestly costs nearly nothing. I mean the landlord might have even offered to pick up the seed if he had of seen they were actively trying to take care of it and it wasn't working.\n\nAs for the barking, that's a tough one. There are plenty of different reasons a dog will bark; be that separation anxiety right up to just purely because of the breed as some are more vocal than others. We had an issue that we had no idea was happening until our neighbor came and talked to us. We all worked and we were putting him in his crate for the time. (he was never in it long as we al had different times to start work. My mother worked in the morning, I worked evenings, and my dad worked overnight, so he wasn't in the crate for a long time, it was mainly when our schedules overlapped to the point no one would be home.) Our neighbor had heard him barking constantly one time and we didn't have any idea about it. As soon as he heard the car pull up, he would stop barking so when we got to the door or whatever, he would be quiet and we were none the wiser. when she told us, we immediately tried to figure out a way to keep him quiet throughout the day and worked on getting him use to being by himself (with the other dogs of course) he was happy being with the other dogs, despite him being only 10 weeks old. We thought for sure he would destroy the house, but we were surprisingly wrong. It could be that they are trying different options in order to keep him quiet, as puppies, much like kids, don't all respond the same way to things. The barking thing is an issue they should have tried to actively address as well, but honestly that's no real fault of their own if they have done everything and he still barks; it could have been just his breed.\n\nThough considering that they didn't pick up after the dog, then I can assume they didn't try to help with the barking either. In the end it was their fault they got evicted, as they weren't keeping up with the puppy. They could try and talk to the landlord and maybe give the puppy to other family to take care of and clean up the yard, the landlord might be forgiving, but that's between them and the landlord at that point; not you.
