I also gave him some money to help him fix it up but he had spend a lot of his own money to fix it. When my 2nd son turned 16 he wanted a motorcycle and I gave him an old motorcycle of mine, it worked fine enough and he hasn't had to spend any money fixing it yet. This was both of their only present from me.\n\nMy daughter's 16th birthday was last week. I know my daughter wanted a car but I don't have a car sitting around to give her. I gave her $500 to put toward a car and got her some jewelry. I told her she would need to save up herself if she wanted a car and I could help her get a loan in my name. She has a job so this isn't out of the question. She was a little sulky about the situation and complained that I had given her brothers vehicles, but understood that I wasn't trying to spite her. I have other younger sons that I will give the same to when they turn 16, so this isn't me trying to single her out.\n\nI obviously should have thought about how I wouldn't be able to give my younger kids the same treatment as the oldest when I gave him a car. But he's significantly older than my other kids so I wasn't really thinking of them when I gave him the car. I was just trying to do something nice for him.\n\nAlthough my daughter isn't to bummed out over the car my ex-wife is a different story. She's seen me give the other boys nice things for their birthday (my eldest is her stepson) and thinks I'm treating her differently because she's a girl and that I always prioritise the boys. Apparently my daughter was more upset about the lack of car than I had thought. She thinks I should at least put more money towards our daughter getting a car as she knows I can afford it and am being an ass by not getting her one. I told her that she could also give our daughter money for a car.\n\nThe truth is I could probably afford to put more money towards buying my daughter a car or even find a cheap used car to buy her. But by giving her the $500 I already spent more directly on her birthday present than the boys as their presents were sitting around collecting dust in my garage. I can't remember how much I gave my son to fix the car but it was max $250. I have 3 younger kids I can't really continue to set a precedent that I'll buy each of them a car. Am I being the asshole? I feel like I ruined her birthday by letting her down.", "created_utc": 1677112382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119j5ds/aita_for_giving_my_son_a_car_when_he_turned_16/", "score": 490, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To that, you added let's say $250 so the boys are winning. \n\nAdditionally, the boys wished for a vehicle and their wish was granted, whereas your daughter wants one thing and has to settle for another (sorry, but not a nice surprise anymore).\n\nTherefore, in this instance, YTA.\n\nShould the mother chip in too?

If I gift someone an expensive painting that was just sitting in my garage it doesn't matter that at the time of gifting them that I didn't spend anything on it. And I also agree that if financial situations change drastically that becomes an important factor and it's more understandable. If the dad was broke and in foreclosure of course it would be reasonable to not gift her a car and it wouldn't be sexism. Otherwise not allowing the same freedom to all of your kids if you can afford it is discrimination. A vehicle isn't just any object. It's freedom", "I also feel like if this wasn\u2019t favoritism but something being difficult financially the solution should have been a conversation with the daughter months ago.

You could've sold the old vehicles and had the proceeds go towards cars for them, and they all work for the rest. It would've made it more fair in the long run.

You may not have spent extra money on the vehicles, but you invested time and showed interest in the boys that you didn't show your daughter.

That meant that everyone had to make sure she didn't ever get upset, and I was on my own. \n\nMy sister failed out of college, and decades later, we aren't allowed to mention it because it's embarrassing to her. I have advanced degrees, and if I mention them, it's rubbing it in her face.

We can't mention that, either. \n\nI am single now, but even when I'm not, I never take anything from my parents. Never will unless it's the only alternative to being unhoused. \n\nOh and she gets my parents' house in the will, because after all, she has kids. I can't have them. \n\nI'm grateful, actually, for a lot of what happened. I am strong and independent, and know that I can manage anything on my own. My sister will never know that freedom.

Third kid? Jewelery?\n\nIt could be the car on the surface, but if there's a 2/3 that the kids get a vehicle? Well, you already set a precedent, which you then fucked up.\n\nThink about it this way - the two boys got projects that they worked on with you ( I imagine). Or at the very least, a motorcycle is worth more than $500, as is a car. Don't care what they put into it, or what you think a car should cost; bluebook looks to be about $2000 for an entry level basic car thats 15 years old and about 100K on the odo, and that's low balling.\n\nNow, I want to you know. I'm calling you asshole based on what you've submitted for judgement. The fact that you are acknowledging that things did not go well and it may have to do with the gift shows a reasonable self-awareness, and a willingness to \"make it right\" so to speak.\n\nHow best to do that? Ask your daughter. Learn her interests. Do something more than impersonal stereotypical girly stuff and money. Work towards something meaningful. You may not even know what that thing might be, that could tie her closer into the Family Lineage, so to speak.", "If the first car was only worth $500 to begin with I could maybe understand the logic, but then you gave him more money to fix it up. If the motorcycle was in good shape it would be over $500 as well. She didn\u2019t want jewelry, she wanted a car and you didn\u2019t even give her enough for a down payment at  some places. I suggest you retrospectively try to figure the value on the other two vehicles and try to match that. \nWhen I got my last car I could afford it on my own, but my grandparents gave me money to help because they had done the same for my sister.

However I feel like as a father you should have had that in mind and had that kinda discussion BEFORE her birthday. Especially if you thought beforehand that she was expecting it.

The car and motorcycle weren\u2019t valued at $0, which means it wasn\u2019t a free gift you were giving them, therefore $500 and some jewelry doesn\u2019t equate.

He gave the son $250 to fix it so that\u2019s total a gift worth around $500, what he gave to the daughter. The motorcycle I\u2019ve no idea (I assume cause it was working that it\u2019s worth more than $500). \n\nPersonally I think OP is in a lose-lose situation. $500 used to get you a rust bucket that barely functions but it doesn\u2019t anymore due to the worldwide car shortage.

I think he needs to sit down with his daughters and the three younger sons and explain that he doesn\u2019t have the funds to buy them all cars at 16 but he plans to give them all $500 to contribute to their own car funds and that they should start saving up their birthday/Christmas money. That way at least the daughter understands it\u2019s not favoritism, it\u2019s the unfortunate consequence of being the middle child in a family with many kids and not enough resources to share equally (and a dad who did not plan well). My mom is the youngest of 6. She never got anything and it totally sucked for her growing up. That\u2019s why she only wanted 2 kids, so she could make sure my brother and I got everything very equally.", "Also he said there is a big age difference between them so he could have saved for a car for the daughter but it seems he thought hey a girl doesnt need one.", "This except why should the mother chip in?

Additional magnitude of petty as hell people saying they still hold grudges over not getting exact equity to their siblings.  \n\nIt's the way things go. My parents gave my younger sibling most of my college fund because I didn't need it. Was I mad? At the time, yes, but only because my parents previously promised me that I could use the fund regardless.   \n\nBut I've since understood that that's just the way things go sometimes. It is what it is. I still have a great relationship with my folks and my siblings.
