I also gave him some money to help him fix it up but he had spend a lot of his own money to fix it. When my 2nd son turned 16 he wanted a motorcycle and I gave him an old motorcycle of mine, it worked fine enough and he hasn't had to spend any money fixing it yet. This was both of their only present from me.\n\nMy daughter's 16th birthday was last week. I know my daughter wanted a car but I don't have a car sitting around to give her. I gave her $500 to put toward a car and got her some jewelry. I told her she would need to save up herself if she wanted a car and I could help her get a loan in my name. She has a job so this isn't out of the question. She was a little sulky about the situation and complained that I had given her brothers vehicles, but understood that I wasn't trying to spite her. I have other younger sons that I will give the same to when they turn 16, so this isn't me trying to single her out.\n\nI obviously should have thought about how I wouldn't be able to give my younger kids the same treatment as the oldest when I gave him a car. But he's significantly older than my other kids so I wasn't really thinking of them when I gave him the car. I was just trying to do something nice for him.\n\nAlthough my daughter isn't to bummed out over the car my ex-wife is a different story. She's seen me give the other boys nice things for their birthday (my eldest is her stepson) and thinks I'm treating her differently because she's a girl and that I always prioritise the boys. Apparently my daughter was more upset about the lack of car than I had thought. She thinks I should at least put more money towards our daughter getting a car as she knows I can afford it and am being an ass by not getting her one. I told her that she could also give our daughter money for a car.\n\nThe truth is I could probably afford to put more money towards buying my daughter a car or even find a cheap used car to buy her. But by giving her the $500 I already spent more directly on her birthday present than the boys as their presents were sitting around collecting dust in my garage. I can't remember how much I gave my son to fix the car but it was max $250. I have 3 younger kids I can't really continue to set a precedent that I'll buy each of them a car. Am I being the asshole? I feel like I ruined her birthday by letting her down.", "created_utc": 1677112382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119j5ds/aita_for_giving_my_son_a_car_when_he_turned_16/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To that, you added let's say $250 so the boys are winning. \n\nAdditionally, the boys wished for a vehicle and their wish was granted, whereas your daughter wants one thing and has to settle for another (sorry, but not a nice surprise anymore).\n\nTherefore, in this instance, YTA.\n\nShould the mother chip in too?

Show your daughter that you have the same respect and love for her as you do your sons. We\u2019re talking lifelong resentment if you don\u2019t fix this with her. Her feelings are valid. YTA", "And he gave his daughter a whole case of resentment.", "This is the comment, OP", "Wish I could upvote this more than once!", "Thank you.", "Yeah like that logic doesn't work at all. If I gift someone an expensive painting that was just sitting in my garage it doesn't matter that at the time of gifting them that I didn't spend anything on it. And I also agree that if financial situations change drastically that becomes an important factor and it's more understandable. If the dad was broke and in foreclosure of course it would be reasonable to not gift her a car and it wouldn't be sexism. Otherwise not allowing the same freedom to all of your kids if you can afford it is discrimination. A vehicle isn't just any object. It's freedom", "I also feel like if this wasn\u2019t favoritism but something being difficult financially the solution should have been a conversation with the daughter months ago. But it seems like it didn\u2019t even occur to him to get her a car, almost more of a \u2018oh she\u2019s 16 - throw her money and jewelry girls like that right?\u2019", "Agree. My dad did this with my brother and I but in reverse and my brother is very  distant with him now (him & I were always close and we shared the car I got without a problem. He never held a grudge against me).Things like that though just get under your skin and if it happens a lot it slowly chips away at the relationship without you even realising it. And to me it's not even entitlement to it. Like in my case it would've been fine if neither of us got cars. The problem was that I got an expensive gift while my brother didn't (I'm the oldest and we have the same parents). For example now I wouldn't give one of my kids an iPhone and $50 to the other. Either both get something expensive or something cheaper.", "I was thinking that last part as well. OP should've thought of this situation beforehand. If you didn't want to give all your kids cars for their 16th birthdays, you should've either been saving up or put money towards cars for all of them instead of giving two of them cars and telling the others to figure it out on their own. You could've sold the old vehicles and had the proceeds go towards cars for them, and they all work for the rest. It would've made it more fair in the long run. Plus, them buying their own cars and paying off loans does teach them some responsibility, and they gain even more respect for the vehicle that they paid for themselves. Obviously, no one is entitled to a free vehicle, but this is a sticky situation you got yourself into OP.", "Someone give this guy an award!\n\nIf I were the daughter, I would definitely be disappointed. You should at least sit down with her and explain things, so she understands where you're coming from, and that it's not because you favor your sons over your daughter", "This!!! And it's not her fault OP had 3 MORE kids after she was born.\n\nEdit: YTA", ">You may not have spent money buying vehicles for your sons, but the value was still much greater than what you have given your daughter.\n\nThis right here. \n\nHow much did it cost to buy the car and motorcycle years ago, and how much could he have sold them for? Why is he acting like these gifts are worth nothing? Who just has a spare car and motorcycle they can afford to just give away? \n\nThose physical items were worth much more than $500. And it's absurd that he thinks that doesn't make a difference.\n\nThis is ridiculous. YTA.", "i\u2019m literally searching for a car rn and if you want a decent one with lower miles it\u2019s atleast 6k and up", "100% this. I'm the youngest and a daughter and the awful piece of shit I drove was made better by my dad teaching me to change the oil and tires. I'll never get that time back and I'm so glad it was well spent.\n\nDaughter is allowed to feel bummed, dad is allowed to not afford a beater or have one on hand ready to go. Maybe meet in the middle somehow OP?", "My son and I did work on parts on the vehicle together. However, my daughter avoids my workshop at all costs so I doubt she would want to work on something like that together. But we are also taking a trip this weekend just the two of us, which should be a similarly bonding experience.", "Why would he do anything for her?", "Except he says he probably CAN afford it.", "No he got into a crash with it and sold it for scrap several years ago.", "Ignore what? He clearly says he can afford it", "> financial difficulties families are facing on the back of the freaking pandemic.\n\nI feel like this doesn\u2019t really apply here since OP specified that he could afford to contribute more or find a used vehicle.", "Just because your parents favoritism made you \u201cfeel better\u201d in the long run doesnt excuse the favoritism.", "Which she will remember her whole life. OP statistics say its almost always the daughters who take care of the parents in old age. Might want to think about that.", "Half the problem is people just have kids, they don\u2019t plan them or for them.  Just squirt them out into the world and hope for the best.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve burned any bridges yet, but you\u2019re on a bit of thin ice with your daughter. Meet her where she is, even if it isn\u2019t the workshop.", "You can afford to take a trip but not out funds towards a car\u2026  why should she need to save when your other kids didn\u2019t. \nReally you just don\u2019t want to help your daughter get a vehicle the way you did your sons. YTA\nYour daughter clearly knows you only value your sons", "Why do you even let the girl live with you? Is it just like a legal obligation", "because she's his daughter and she should be treated the same as he treats his sons", "But she's a girl! Come on he'd actually have to think about her for once!", "Can he really or is it just pressure to appease the daughter and ex?", "And what scrap value did he get for it?", "Then he should have her pay $500 towards a second hand car with him making up the difference. \n\nThe wisdom of Solomon.", "What on earth is this comment? He had two messed up cars to distribute and he distributed them in order. Now he reached a middle ground of giving money. He has stated that he plans to do this with the rest of his children, including two sons. Yeah the first two got a better deal and he needs to work that out with the daughter (and other kids), but this has nothing to do with gender.", "He stated quite clearly that his two younger sons will be getting the same gift as the daughter. He had two broken cars to distribute, they\u2019ve been distributed.\n\nHe likely needs to adjust the gift for his daughter and other kids down the road to make it even, but gender has nothing to do with this.", "It sounds like he actually can, given what he wrote in the judgement bot post as well.", "Ooh good question, I wanna know. Op yta", "> her pay $500\n\nHis ex-wife or his daughter?", "His daughter.", "Why should she have to pay $500 when the boys didn\u2019t?", "Because he gave her $500 and didn't give his sons $500?"]}
