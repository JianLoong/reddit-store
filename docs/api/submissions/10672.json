I also gave him some money to help him fix it up but he had spend a lot of his own money to fix it. When my 2nd son turned 16 he wanted a motorcycle and I gave him an old motorcycle of mine, it worked fine enough and he hasn't had to spend any money fixing it yet. This was both of their only present from me.\n\nMy daughter's 16th birthday was last week. I know my daughter wanted a car but I don't have a car sitting around to give her. I gave her $500 to put toward a car and got her some jewelry. I told her she would need to save up herself if she wanted a car and I could help her get a loan in my name. She has a job so this isn't out of the question. She was a little sulky about the situation and complained that I had given her brothers vehicles, but understood that I wasn't trying to spite her. I have other younger sons that I will give the same to when they turn 16, so this isn't me trying to single her out.\n\nI obviously should have thought about how I wouldn't be able to give my younger kids the same treatment as the oldest when I gave him a car. But he's significantly older than my other kids so I wasn't really thinking of them when I gave him the car. I was just trying to do something nice for him.\n\nAlthough my daughter isn't to bummed out over the car my ex-wife is a different story. She's seen me give the other boys nice things for their birthday (my eldest is her stepson) and thinks I'm treating her differently because she's a girl and that I always prioritise the boys. Apparently my daughter was more upset about the lack of car than I had thought. She thinks I should at least put more money towards our daughter getting a car as she knows I can afford it and am being an ass by not getting her one. I told her that she could also give our daughter money for a car.\n\nThe truth is I could probably afford to put more money towards buying my daughter a car or even find a cheap used car to buy her. But by giving her the $500 I already spent more directly on her birthday present than the boys as their presents were sitting around collecting dust in my garage. I can't remember how much I gave my son to fix the car but it was max $250. I have 3 younger kids I can't really continue to set a precedent that I'll buy each of them a car. Am I being the asshole? I feel like I ruined her birthday by letting her down.", "created_utc": 1677112382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119j5ds/aita_for_giving_my_son_a_car_when_he_turned_16/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To that, you added let's say $250 so the boys are winning. \n\nAdditionally, the boys wished for a vehicle and their wish was granted, whereas your daughter wants one thing and has to settle for another (sorry, but not a nice surprise anymore).\n\nTherefore, in this instance, YTA.\n\nShould the mother chip in too?

If I gift someone an expensive painting that was just sitting in my garage it doesn't matter that at the time of gifting them that I didn't spend anything on it. And I also agree that if financial situations change drastically that becomes an important factor and it's more understandable. If the dad was broke and in foreclosure of course it would be reasonable to not gift her a car and it wouldn't be sexism. Otherwise not allowing the same freedom to all of your kids if you can afford it is discrimination. A vehicle isn't just any object. It's freedom", "I also feel like if this wasn\u2019t favoritism but something being difficult financially the solution should have been a conversation with the daughter months ago.

You could've sold the old vehicles and had the proceeds go towards cars for them, and they all work for the rest. It would've made it more fair in the long run.

But it wouldn't surprise me in the least if you end up needing a new car when the older one is 16.\n\nHelp her get a car asap. She sounds responsible. Cosign a loan for a 'decent' used car. She makes the payments, you add her to your insurance? \n\nYTA for not even discussing this before her birthday.", "YTA.\n\nAnd to make it clear.\n\nYou are the ass****.", "YTA why should she be treated differently because she was born later?  Sounds like she's an afterthought and she knows it.", "YTA, but not necessarily because you didn't get her a vehicle. I think YTA because of the lack of thought and effort you gave your daughter compared to your sons. Granted, Idk all the specifics and dynamics of these relationships, but, for me, it just sounds like you catered more to the boys than her. You may not have spent extra money on the vehicles, but you invested time and showed interest in the boys that you didn't show your daughter. Just giving her money and jewelry, if it's not like special jewelry, kind of comes off as a throw-away gift, and no kid wants to be the throw-away kid.", "The precedent is set. Where I grew up, this would be remembered forever, even by the friends. YTA", "YTA. If either son wrecked their vehicle tomorrow how much would insurance pay? How about a few years ago when you gave them the cars? How much is the value of the car from Kelly blue book? Or if the car was traded in? I guarantee it wouldn\u2019t be zero, it\u2019s worth at least a few hundred scrap. More depending on the model because catalytic converters can be salvaged. And then on top of it you gave son #1 additional money to fix the car up. I can see why she\u2019s upset. Have you discussed finding her a car? Asked friends about a clunker comparable to the one you gave the boys? Or did you hand her the money and wash your hands of it? If so you\u2019re doubly the AH.", "Yes, YTA.  A big one.", "According to you you COULD help get her a car, you\u2019re going on a weekend trip with your daughter, but in the same breath said you can\u2019t get her a car? \n\nI know what you\u2019re trying to say about not having a car on hand, but you set a precedent, and you\u2019re showing your daughter favoritism. You have a shop, you can get a cheap one and have her help you fix it.", "YTA. You knew she was expecting a vehicle.", "YTA. It's not really about the car or motorcycle, it's that you're trying to justify you're somehow treating the kids equally when you've clearly demonstrated favoritism to your two oldest sons.", "YTA... I'm the oldest and got a hand me down car when I turned 16. My younger sister got a brand new car when she turned 16. We are 2 years apart. My parents said basically what you said in reverse. They had more money when she got her license. They saw nothing wrong. Honestly it hurt a ton!", "YTA!!", "Yta...all kids get a car now. You need to fix this", "She wanted a car, I got her jewellery \ud83d\ude44 YTA", "YtA. My sisters and I had to work and buy our own cars (no help with loans either) my brother was given my parents old car, while they bought them selves a new car. It still pisses us off to this day.", "The fact that you gave her jewelry and didn\u2019t put the money towards the car for her says everything. You\u2019re being sexist; you know it, she knows it, and YTA. Do what you can to make it right.", "You said you can afford it. What is impeding that you go out, buy a car in a similar state and give to your daughter? \"Oooh but I already had the car and the bike.\" And did both, by any chance, fell from the sky into you possession? You bought them. If you ran out of crap to give your kids, go buy more crap and be fucking fair.\n\nBuy your daughter a damn car. And start saving for your other kids cars too. YTA.", "You already set a precedent. Jewelery? Really? \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nWhy the fuck did you spend money on jewelry when you knew she didnt want jewlery. She wanted to finally be equal to her brothers and have her own ride. You couldnt even do that could you? Your sons must be so precious to you while you could give two shits about your daughter. This is going to turn into \"why wont my daughter talk to me??\"", "You did pay for the car and the motorbike originally when you gave it to the boys.. It is favoring the boys. If the eldest has upgraded was he told to think about his sister or siblings and pass it down? You spent money on jewelry when you knew she wanted a car. \n\nYTA. I feel this is due to gender as well. Oh girls only want pretty trinkets and shopping money.. she should be grateful\u2019 phhht. Her future bf will drive her around. . . \n\nIf you can\u2019t afford it then sure. But you can. She just isn\u2019t worth it to you.", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn't take a brain to know that this WILL understandably make her feel like she's gotten a significantly worse present in a very unfair way - and it's true! \n\nSo instead of accomodating her properly to avoid those very legitimate feelings, you're giving her the big middlefinger and giving her excuses for why it is like it is. Where's your parental spirit in the sense of making sacrifices for your child so that they aren't worse off than the others? you're literally creating this situation and doing nothing about it. Arsehole move.", "YTA.  You set a precedent when you gave a vehicle to not just your 1st born, but then the 2nd son.\n\nWhat else is she supposed to think?  \n\nI'm not a parent but even I know that you need to always be aware of how you treat your kids and try to equalize it as much as you can.  Otherwise - you clearly just favour some vs others and you need to accept that your children will always remember that.\n\nA car = freedom to a 16 year old.  Remember that feeling?  \n\nYou don't need to blow the budget but you need to make this right with her.  There are plenty of examples of kids becoming adults and deciding they don't need their parents in their lives after years of unfair or toxic treatment.  That could be her.  Do you even care, though?", "Yeah YTA. You did ruin her birthday.", "Yeah YTA. You did ruin her birthday.", "Let's all say it together: nursing homeeeee. YTA. Even if you have favorites, you don't have to show it.", "Exactly. Just because those items were currently in his possession doesn\u2019t mean they were free presents. OP could\u2019ve sold them, did OP cover registration or insurance? Saying you can\u2019t set a precedence of buying cars because there are 3 more younger than the daughter doesn\u2019t make him not an asshole. Will OP just pass along another car in 4 years when he\u2019s tired of his? \n\nAlso would it not be possible to have \u201cfamily\u201d cars where the kids can use it but if they want their own wheels they need to buy it themselves. Will OP help the daughter find reliable car or just say you\u2019re own your own kid.", "And sons with your new wife.  So basically you cast your daughter to the side for this new and improved family.\n\nYTA.", "Didn't you understand? The cars were collecting dust in the garage so they're absolutely worthless. Right, OP?\n\nJust like the money in your savings account, just sitting there collecting dust. Maybe transfer all of them to your daughter?", "You're totally right, OP YTA 100%. However, I also can see how you put yourself in a lose lose situation. Your first son got a busted car you had laying around and some cash to fix it. Second son got an unused motorcycle you had laying around. You're now on your third child and ran out of crap vehicles to give away. By not giving your daughter a car, you've shown favoritism to the sons. Had you gone out and bought your daughter a car, spending more money and effort than you did the boys gifts, then you're favoring your daughter. You really didn't think having three kids and two junk vehicles through.", "It's not even like he got the car and motorcycle for free to begin with, they just weren't valuable to him anymore. He essentially gifted them the amount he spent on it when he bought it, even if the car was in disrepair, it wasn't worth nothing, and neither is a fully functional motorcycle.", "Yea... Really depends on the car. People like to hand over trash.", "Exactly. Plus, you know your daughter wants a car, but you give her jewelry instead of additional money towards a car? We probably need more context but it seems sexist. Both of the boys get vehicles of freedom and the daughter gets $500 and jewelry. I would be insulted if I were the daughter, and pissed if I were the mom.", "I also think he kinda made it worse by giving her jewelry. Cuz if I was the daughter, that would make it feel like it was a gender based decision, regardless of whether or not that's actually true. \"The boys got cars, I the girl got jewelry\" is a strong message here, even if unintentional.", "I'm in my 50s.  I still remember that my older brothers and younger sisters all got a car for graduation, and I got nothing.  I didn't need a car, I worked my ass off in high school and bought my own.  But I thought I'd get something.", "This is a good point. Even if the car was absolutely junk and sold for scrap, OP still could've gotten around $300 for it in my neck of the woods. So a bare minimum $300 + $250 is STILL more than the daughter got by fifty bucks. And of course, the son was able to fix it up and drive it, which means it WASN'T junk, which means OP could've sold it for more.", "Well why would he have two old cars just laying around? In terms of people who have old cars sitting collecting dust, I would imagine 1 car is probably the norm", ">And how convenient that you don't give cars when your   \n>  \n>daughter  \n>  \n> turns 16.\n\nOh ffs please. I agree that OP is TA but come on. This sub is so fuckin rabidly eager to turn everything into sexism. You think he planned this by keeping a used car + a motorcycle around? Sounds like a coincidence to me.", "Agreed. I can\u2019t believe he thinks that $500 up front and being willing to help a literal child take on debt is even remotely the same. \n\nOp needs to bite the bullet and buy her the damn car outright to make things even. He also better start saving for cars for his younger kids while he\u2019s at it.", "I was thinking that too. Especially with how different the financial situation is now to how it was several years ago. What an used car cost 10 years ago is not even close to what it's like now.", "He knew she wanted a car and has a part time job. Jewelry is a piss poor way to show equality. The brothers didn't just save up and surprise get a car.", "It\u2019s like corrosion to a relationship", "Did your brother ever complained to your father over the issue?", "This. OP could\u2019ve sold all the vehicles he\u2019s just had lying around for how long and then evenly distributed the money into savings accounts for his kids for when they were old enough to get cars \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I know I had a savings account my grandma started for me when I was a baby just with some extra money she had here and there and by the time I got my license, with all the deposits and interest I was able to get a fairly decent used car", "My parents bought me a brand new Nissan XTerra my senior year of high school (!!!!

And so, I LOVED HER).  \n\nAnd then promptly took it away when I went to college because my sister didn\u2019t want to go to the highschool in our district so she needed a car to drive to the one SHE wanted to go to.  \n\nThey eventually bought her a car.

At the same time, they were just purchasing themselves a new vehicle and chose to gift my (early 30s and still living with them) brother their old one.  It was worth about $12K, so one would expect that either they\u2019d have me only pay $3K or that they\u2019d have him pay 6 and me pay 9 if they needed the full $15K back.  Instead, I paid them back every penny of that $15K and my brother hasn\u2019t paid a cent.  They even kept paying insurance on it for the better part of a year.
