I met these friends while I was studying and we all come from similar academic backgrounds and now work in similar fields. We can probably come across as a little pretentious when we're together as a group. Some of that comes from insecurity; most of us were quite socially awkward at school and I guess feeling intellectually superior is a way of compensating for that. I know it's not an excuse to look down on others and I truly don't believe I'm better than anyone else. \n\nMy bf is very different to my friends and I and he isn't like anyone I've dated previously. He's kind, sweet, funny, not to mention being exceptionally good-looking. However, he isn't the most intellectual person in the world. I'm not saying he's stupid in the slightest and there are plenty of things he's very good at. He's just a little ditzy and not well educated. He has a manual job, he finds reading and writing difficult and can barely spell, and he doesn't know a lot of things I would consider general knowledge. It doesn't interfere with our relationship in the least and we have a great time together, but I admit I was wary of introducing him to this group of friends. \n\nInitially, I thought it was going well. There was a little awkwardness when my friends asked him what he studied and about his career. He also seemed quite confused by some of the conversation. I admit I did make a few little jokes at his expense to break the tension. Ordinarily he doesn't mind poking fun at himself and he seemed to be taking it very well. Unfortunately, most of my friends also got on board with this and it did start feeling quite mean. He was more gracious than I would have been in his position but I did notice he was getting flustered and stumbling over his words and when we played a few games he said he couldn't understand the rules even though he probably would have done if he'd been more relaxed. \n\nI didn't ask my friends to stop teasing him because I knew it would create an uncomfortable atmosphere and most probably cause the evening to end prematurely. My bf stayed all evening and carried on being friendly so I told myself it couldn't have been that bad. However, he made excuses not to stay over after they'd left and he's seemed more distant since so I'm concerned it really hurt his feelings.

Him making jokes out of himself is completely different than other people doing the same to him, and it does not mean that it is okay for you to do it either. You and your friends need to get a reality check that you're not better than other people because you're \"smart\". You cannot measure intelligence by schooling, how many words people know, how many books they've read, etc. So many intelligent people are cast aside and deemed stupid because they have disabilities, because they don't have money or time to go through good education, or because they don't even have access to good education at all. And to top it off, intelligence only gets you so far. Creativity, friendliness, and connections are so important too. It seems that you act your worst around these friends, and its likely not a good idea to stay around them until they are able to not put other people down to make themselves feel better.", "YTA a joke is only funny if everybody is laughing.

You should not  have started with joking about your boyfriend but rather a joke about yourself or your friends to put your boyfriend at ease.

Then in public, you talked down to him and your friends joined in.

Anyways you are a bit confused about the conversation, and your boyfriend notices and teases you to ease the tension with his friends. His friends jump on board and now everyone is straight up teasing you to a point you feel it\u2019s mean spirited. You try to move onto a new game, but now all you can think about is how you\u2019re with someone you really like but their friends and him obviously think less of you.

You went into this knowing your friends might be jerks, joined in on being a jerk to make your friends feel better- at the expense of your boyfriend, acknowledged along the way things may be going to far, and did nothing.

Contact them and tell them that after thinking it over, you realized that teasing your bf because he's not smart in the same way  you and your friends are was sophomoric and inconsiderate and that you're ashamed and hope none of you repeat the mistake. It wouldn't hurt to list all the wonderful qualities you appreciate in him. \n\nThen apologize to your boyfriend for your cowardice and tell him your friends were out of line.\n\nMaybe you should spend more time with your bf's friends.

You love him? That's a laugh. How would you have felt if he introduced you to his friends and they were all making fun of you for being a geek and he stood there and laughed with them. Your friends are awful too. Your boyfriend is the only one of you to have any class. I feel so sorry for him that the person who supposedly loves him would treat him like this and then say you didn't want to stop them and create an awkward environment. Newsflash it already was. YTA for making fun of him in the first place. YTA for allowing your friends to make fun of him for one single second. YTA for thinking in any way you are not wrong for all of it.

Well, that\u2019s a personal problem and you really ought to fix that because your boyfriend sounds like he is a mature adult who knows how to fit in society and you don\u2019t.

Honestly, go date someone from your academic circle instead of a nice guy that you and your friends can use as a punching bag to make yourselves feel better.  What an awful thing to do to someone you are supposed to care about.  Oh, and this is more than not just calling out your friends.  You started, encouraged then actively participated in the bullying, all of you were assholes and don't try to distance yourself from your actions here.

YTA", "It is not the same, but this reminded me of a situation I had. My friends and I have been friends for years and years, and we have a sense of humour where everyone \"hits\" everyone. We make jokes at our expense but only about topics we know well that won't hurt the other person. We have had this dynamic since the group started over 15 years ago.\n\nTwo years ago one of our friends said he was coming to town with his new girlfriend (he was studying in another city and had been dating this girl for two months top at the time).\nWe had dinner at my place, and at some point during the night, we started joking as we usually do. This time in particular, our friend (who was introducing his girlfriend) made a joke first, and so we all started \"hitting him\" with different jokes and comebacks. All those jokes seemed hurtful to a bystander, but they weren\u2019t for my friend because we already knew those topics didn't bother him. It was all laughs until his new girlfriend made a really cruel joke about him. It was in the \"tone\" with the other jokes, but the thing was it was about a really sensitive topic for our friend. So far, my friend had laughed and joked and returned the blood without an issue until his girlfriend made that joke. He went silent, and so did the rest of us.\nI understood this girl was just trying to \"fit in,\" but she was absolutely mean to our friend (her own boyfriend). It was clearly something my friend had told her in confidence. And I snapped. I told the group there were certain limits, and maybe we had overstepped with our jokes. I apologised to my friend in the name of the group and so did the rest, except his girlfriend. My friend laughed it out, and the conversation changed into something different.\n\nYour situation reminded me of this because you may know what your boyfriend likes to joke about, but not your friends. They don't know him. It's up to you to cut their crap out when it goes over a limit. That's what I did with my friend, and the next day, he thanked me. He said he had been stunned to hear his girlfriend to about him that way and a little hurt because she sounded honest (all of our jokes were a clear lie).\n\nYour friends were AH. You need to know a person and have earned their trust to be allowed to joke at their expense with their authorisation. What your friends did was way out of line. And YTA for not stopping them.", "Yeah, OP, you shot yourself in the foot, over and over again. Got any toes left?\n\nYou didn't stand up to your friends because it would create an \"uncomfortable atmosphere.\" Just what kind of atmosphere do you think your BF was breathing at that moment????\n\nWho means more to you: your friends, or your BF?  If you had to choose between them, which would you choose? It looks to me like you chose your friends, and you're about to lose your BF.\n\nYou did it to yourself, girl.

Having diplomas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re better. You just proved it", "Oh, was there drinking going on? I find that when I drink that I get kinda like a bully with some of my words when I\u2019m just having fun. I\u2019m afraid that your friends took a cue from you. YTA for not stopping the way the conversation went", "YTA. It shouldn't even be a question. Why wouldn't you stand up for your bf? Why are you more concerned about your friends' feelings than your SO? \nListen, my husband and I definitely have way different backgrounds. I went to private schools and he was in the public school system and had some slight learning issues. I'm talking sometimes he would ask what a word meant that I said because he didn't know it, BUT instead of being a total jerk about it, I varied my word choice when we have discussions. Does it bother me? No, we also have kids so I have to do the same with them. I don't love him for his education. I love him because he's amazing and really makes me loved and lifts me up. Which is how a relationship should be. Lifting each other up, not beating them down.  I'm surprised he's still with you as I would have left the second you thought it was okay to poke fun in front of a group of your friends.", "Honestly, would expect more from a group of \"intelligent\" people who know how it feels being awkward in social situations. \n\nAlso, book smart isn't the only indicator of intelligence. The rest are obviously lacking in other areas that are arguably more important.\n\nI actually feel so sad for the boyfriend. It would have been humiliating but he got through it. I've been in this situation with family, and it's awful knowing if you say something you have a whole group of people that would likely turn and invalidate your feelings. \n\nI hope he finds someone who won't use him as an ice breaker and sit there while people are being awful at his expense. I hope it was an eye opener for him. \n\n(YTA)", "I had to hold myself back once when my partner's \"friends\" kept making fun of him in ways that did not seem very fun. I asked him later about it and he kind of shrugged it off- he didn't like it but that's just how they are.
