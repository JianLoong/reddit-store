I met these friends while I was studying and we all come from similar academic backgrounds and now work in similar fields. We can probably come across as a little pretentious when we're together as a group. Some of that comes from insecurity; most of us were quite socially awkward at school and I guess feeling intellectually superior is a way of compensating for that. I know it's not an excuse to look down on others and I truly don't believe I'm better than anyone else. \n\nMy bf is very different to my friends and I and he isn't like anyone I've dated previously. He's kind, sweet, funny, not to mention being exceptionally good-looking. However, he isn't the most intellectual person in the world. I'm not saying he's stupid in the slightest and there are plenty of things he's very good at. He's just a little ditzy and not well educated. He has a manual job, he finds reading and writing difficult and can barely spell, and he doesn't know a lot of things I would consider general knowledge. It doesn't interfere with our relationship in the least and we have a great time together, but I admit I was wary of introducing him to this group of friends. \n\nInitially, I thought it was going well. There was a little awkwardness when my friends asked him what he studied and about his career. He also seemed quite confused by some of the conversation. I admit I did make a few little jokes at his expense to break the tension. Ordinarily he doesn't mind poking fun at himself and he seemed to be taking it very well. Unfortunately, most of my friends also got on board with this and it did start feeling quite mean. He was more gracious than I would have been in his position but I did notice he was getting flustered and stumbling over his words and when we played a few games he said he couldn't understand the rules even though he probably would have done if he'd been more relaxed. \n\nI didn't ask my friends to stop teasing him because I knew it would create an uncomfortable atmosphere and most probably cause the evening to end prematurely. My bf stayed all evening and carried on being friendly so I told myself it couldn't have been that bad. However, he made excuses not to stay over after they'd left and he's seemed more distant since so I'm concerned it really hurt his feelings.

Him making jokes out of himself is completely different than other people doing the same to him, and it does not mean that it is okay for you to do it either. You and your friends need to get a reality check that you're not better than other people because you're \"smart\". You cannot measure intelligence by schooling, how many words people know, how many books they've read, etc. So many intelligent people are cast aside and deemed stupid because they have disabilities, because they don't have money or time to go through good education, or because they don't even have access to good education at all. And to top it off, intelligence only gets you so far. Creativity, friendliness, and connections are so important too. It seems that you act your worst around these friends, and its likely not a good idea to stay around them until they are able to not put other people down to make themselves feel better.", "YTA a joke is only funny if everybody is laughing. If you make a joke about someone who is your social equal or has more power than you it\u2019s funny, if you\u2019re joking about someone less powerful than you it\u2019s bullying.\n\nYour friends as a group held much more influence than your boyfriend, the outsider. You should not  have started with joking about your boyfriend but rather a joke about yourself or your friends to put your boyfriend at ease.

Then in public, you talked down to him and your friends joined in.

Anyways you are a bit confused about the conversation, and your boyfriend notices and teases you to ease the tension with his friends. His friends jump on board and now everyone is straight up teasing you to a point you feel it\u2019s mean spirited. You try to move onto a new game, but now all you can think about is how you\u2019re with someone you really like but their friends and him obviously think less of you.

You try to do the polite thing and stay, not wanting to sour their night even though they soured yours.\n\nYou finally get yourself out of that situation, now ask yourself.. do you really want to see that person and their friends again?\n\nOf course YTfuckingA. You went into this knowing your friends might be jerks, joined in on being a jerk to make your friends feel better- at the expense of your boyfriend, acknowledged along the way things may be going to far, and did nothing.

You and your friends were intellectual bullies. Contact them and tell them that after thinking it over, you realized that teasing your bf because he's not smart in the same way  you and your friends are was sophomoric and inconsiderate and that you're ashamed and hope none of you repeat the mistake. It wouldn't hurt to list all the wonderful qualities you appreciate in him. \n\nThen apologize to your boyfriend for your cowardice and tell him your friends were out of line.\n\nMaybe you should spend more time with your bf's friends. They're probably more accepting of you than your friends have been of him.", "YTA this is brutal. Most people gush over their partners when introducing them to friends and you did the opposite.

You love him? That's a laugh. How would you have felt if he introduced you to his friends and they were all making fun of you for being a geek and he stood there and laughed with them. Your friends are awful too. Your boyfriend is the only one of you to have any class. I feel so sorry for him that the person who supposedly loves him would treat him like this and then say you didn't want to stop them and create an awkward environment. Newsflash it already was. YTA for making fun of him in the first place. YTA for allowing your friends to make fun of him for one single second. YTA for thinking in any way you are not wrong for all of it.

He deserve somebody much better than you.", "YTA\n\nThere is a HUGE difference between poking fun at yourself, and other people making fun of you.  Often people use self-deprecating humor as a means of forestalling others making fun of you, not because they like being laughed at. \n\nIf you want to make jokes at someone's expense to 'break the tension' then make them at your own expense.  If you have to make jokes about someone else, then make them about things the other person is good at.  Like pretending that Arnold Palmer isn't good at golf.", "YTA. This breaks my heart.
