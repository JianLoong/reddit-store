I met these friends while I was studying and we all come from similar academic backgrounds and now work in similar fields. We can probably come across as a little pretentious when we're together as a group. Some of that comes from insecurity; most of us were quite socially awkward at school and I guess feeling intellectually superior is a way of compensating for that. I know it's not an excuse to look down on others and I truly don't believe I'm better than anyone else. \n\nMy bf is very different to my friends and I and he isn't like anyone I've dated previously. He's kind, sweet, funny, not to mention being exceptionally good-looking. However, he isn't the most intellectual person in the world. I'm not saying he's stupid in the slightest and there are plenty of things he's very good at. He's just a little ditzy and not well educated. He has a manual job, he finds reading and writing difficult and can barely spell, and he doesn't know a lot of things I would consider general knowledge. It doesn't interfere with our relationship in the least and we have a great time together, but I admit I was wary of introducing him to this group of friends. \n\nInitially, I thought it was going well. There was a little awkwardness when my friends asked him what he studied and about his career. He also seemed quite confused by some of the conversation. I admit I did make a few little jokes at his expense to break the tension. Ordinarily he doesn't mind poking fun at himself and he seemed to be taking it very well. Unfortunately, most of my friends also got on board with this and it did start feeling quite mean. He was more gracious than I would have been in his position but I did notice he was getting flustered and stumbling over his words and when we played a few games he said he couldn't understand the rules even though he probably would have done if he'd been more relaxed. \n\nI didn't ask my friends to stop teasing him because I knew it would create an uncomfortable atmosphere and most probably cause the evening to end prematurely. My bf stayed all evening and carried on being friendly so I told myself it couldn't have been that bad. However, he made excuses not to stay over after they'd left and he's seemed more distant since so I'm concerned it really hurt his feelings.

Him making jokes out of himself is completely different than other people doing the same to him, and it does not mean that it is okay for you to do it either. You and your friends need to get a reality check that you're not better than other people because you're \"smart\". You cannot measure intelligence by schooling, how many words people know, how many books they've read, etc. So many intelligent people are cast aside and deemed stupid because they have disabilities, because they don't have money or time to go through good education, or because they don't even have access to good education at all. And to top it off, intelligence only gets you so far. Creativity, friendliness, and connections are so important too. It seems that you act your worst around these friends, and its likely not a good idea to stay around them until they are able to not put other people down to make themselves feel better.", "YTA a joke is only funny if everybody is laughing.

You should not  have started with joking about your boyfriend but rather a joke about yourself or your friends to put your boyfriend at ease.

Then in public, you talked down to him and your friends joined in.

Anyways you are a bit confused about the conversation, and your boyfriend notices and teases you to ease the tension with his friends. His friends jump on board and now everyone is straight up teasing you to a point you feel it\u2019s mean spirited. You try to move onto a new game, but now all you can think about is how you\u2019re with someone you really like but their friends and him obviously think less of you.

You went into this knowing your friends might be jerks, joined in on being a jerk to make your friends feel better- at the expense of your boyfriend, acknowledged along the way things may be going to far, and did nothing.

Contact them and tell them that after thinking it over, you realized that teasing your bf because he's not smart in the same way  you and your friends are was sophomoric and inconsiderate and that you're ashamed and hope none of you repeat the mistake. It wouldn't hurt to list all the wonderful qualities you appreciate in him. \n\nThen apologize to your boyfriend for your cowardice and tell him your friends were out of line.\n\nMaybe you should spend more time with your bf's friends.

You love him? That's a laugh. How would you have felt if he introduced you to his friends and they were all making fun of you for being a geek and he stood there and laughed with them. Your friends are awful too. Your boyfriend is the only one of you to have any class. I feel so sorry for him that the person who supposedly loves him would treat him like this and then say you didn't want to stop them and create an awkward environment. Newsflash it already was. YTA for making fun of him in the first place. YTA for allowing your friends to make fun of him for one single second. YTA for thinking in any way you are not wrong for all of it.

He can\u2019t do that. He needs to break his partners self esteem to make sure the poor guy never leaves him. Repulsive. Huge YTA.", "It's not a large age gap. It is just enough that he would naturally be at a different point in things like his career. We're all in our 30s, he's in his 20s.", "Obviously he has great characteristics that you lack. For starters he's not a giant pompous asshole.", "I thought raising it as an issue might make it worse when I don't know for sure how he felt about it.", "I completely missed that. Let me go edit. Thanks.", "Lbr, you\u2019ve proven he\u2019s out of your league for real and good.", "It's not his looks that put him out of your league, it's his EQ. And IQ will never make up for that. Good luck with the serious life-experience education you're about to get.\n\nYTA", "Ah. You're tearing him down so he doesn't feel confident enough to leave you. I want you to realize that's emotional abuse.\n\nYou need to sit with that for a while. I mean really sit with it. Falling all over yourself to apologize, trying to be extra sweet to show how you've changed? That would be love bombing. So no. You NEED to sit with this, because you've got some radioactive bullshit going on in your brain.", "Lol OP don't you get it? You're not just ugly on the outside... you're ugly on the INSIDE as well!", "I think you need to be single, there is a lot of room for growth. Just because you think he\u2019s out of your doesn\u2019t mean you need to treat him like that. Omg", "So there's another imbalance of power.\n\nHow could you OP? How could you just sit there and let your friends tear him to pieces? Your excuses are pathetic. \n\nYTA", "You didn\u2019t know how he felt about it? So you assume he likes being constantly ridiculed during a social situation?! He didn\u2019t say anything because they are YOUR friends. You could have called them out (even with a light or jokey tone) and said enough was enough, but instead you let your friends bully your bf. He deserves more respect from you.", "A sincere apology never makes things worse.  For smart people you all don't know much about life.", "That\u2019s because you are ditzy in the interpersonal skills department and have a hard time understanding how to form and maintain relationships, much like you say your boyfriend struggles with spelling or reading. You don\u2019t know how he feels about it? Go ask home, talk to him, open the dialogue if you actually care. Guess what though, your boyfriend seemed to have maneuvered that awkward situation well and realized that is not what someone does to someone they care about. But apparently he is the dumb one in your story?\n\nGet out of the mindset that book smarts is all that matters and realize each person has different strengths and skills. Maybe instead of looking at what you offer that your partner does not, you should acknowledge and appreciate what they offer you that you can\u2019t and try to learn from it.", "No worries l. OP mentioned it in the comments when someone came for him."]}
