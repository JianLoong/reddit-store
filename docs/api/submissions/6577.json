I promised myself that I was never going to grow up and marry someone like my dad. \n\nNow, years later....I'm kind of in that position. It's true that Tom does bring in a lot of money, but so do I.

After that, he just started slacking until I was doing the majority of the household chores and work.

He kind of looked at me weirdly, and then went and sat on the couch and played video games while Anna napped. Every once in a while he would look over at me, and then go back to playing video games. Later he finally puts down the controller and came up to me and asked why the sandwiches weren't ready yet. I told him that he knew I had a big project I was working on and would do it later. He tried to take the computer away from me coaxingly and saying that Anna would be hungry and that the project could wait. \n\nAt that point I kind of snapped. I was stressed from the project and I hadn't eaten all day (my fault) and I sort of yelled.

I said I was sorry for trying to push my duties onto him. I had been about to make the sandwiches after a small portion of the work was done, to relax with a bit of cooking before returning to the project, but I then told him that I absolutely would make the sandwiches - but only when all my work was done.

Like you said, he's got arms.", "NTA - You should not accept this behavior from him. He is a grown man. He can make food and provide food for his daughter.

It has to change or you have to find an actual adult to be in a relationship with. Good luck.", "NTA. I hardly consider making sandwiches cooking unless you out there smoking pork shoulders for 8 hours and making bbq sauce from scratch and baking bread. Seriously even a monkey could slap some lunch meat on two pieces of bread. Your husband needs a wake up call. Its 2024 not 1950.

A 32 year old man who thinks whining like a sulky toddler is a reasonable behaviour and is incapable of preparing sandwiches, aka the most basic of meals? He sounds pathetic!", "NTA.   \n\nHe acts childish and is lazy. He is old enough to make a sandwich by his own and it\u2019s not your job to cook for him all the time!      \nMaybe you two should sit down and decide who has which responsibilities. Like this he can see how much you are doing and how much less he is doing maybe he is open to change his habits.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou are not your husband\u2019s housekeeper / maid / chef. He\u2019s a fully grown man who can\u2019t make a fucking sandwich?! No. He\u2019s a lazy misogynist.

If your local library has study spaces, sign up for one and work from there. He thinks that you're home, so you're *home.* You're available to him. \n\nWhich wouldn't be unreasonable except that YOU'RE NOT HIS MAID.\n\nIf you have work to do, and he pulls stuff like this, don't engage. Gather your computer and notes and pens, put them in your bag, and get out. \n\nHe's whining because he knows you can hear him. If he refuses to listen to you when you say you're busy, then refuse to listen to him until you're done. \n\nI would also recommend making a chore chart. Just so he sees everything you do. And none of this \"I work full time, I bring in more money than you\" malarky. \n\nDo both of you work full time? Do both of you contribute to the household? \n\nIf the answer to both of those questions is \"Yes\", then your household work should be divided evenly.

And you've allowed it to happen.\n\nYou're NTA for this particular situation, but you have been a major contributing factor as to why he feels that this is okay. For example the \"cooking is YOUR job\" comment. He only feels that way because you've taken it upon yourself to do all the cooking. If you want to be respected and have him take on an equal share, then you'll need to force him to step up. Or continue to be a doormat and wipe his ass for him until the day you die of exhaustion.", "NTA.\n\nSorry, but slapping some condiments between pieces of bread is NOT cooking. I'm pretty sure he can manage that by himself.\n\nAlso, divvying up chores is normal, but if the person that is supposed to do those chores is REALLY busy, it's also normal to adjust to that situation. If your hubby is so against making lunch, there's probably services that are able to bring ready-made food to your door.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for the sit-down talk. He started weak, tested the waters, and found he could push it all on you. If you really don't want that, then you and he need to have some serious conversations. Otherwise, you'll be in the same place you are now - the same one you didn't want when you watched your mother do it.", "NTA - he's an adult. He can take care of food and was clearly oblivious to how stressed you are. Sandwiches aren't that hard. He should have taken into consideration how stressed you are. \n\nBUT you need to get better about communicating and figure out how to find a better balance in your household. If he wants to be a child and play video games while his wife does all the housework, treat him like a child and make a chore chart. Yes, I'm that petty.", "NTA. He is an adult and has the ability to see the inequity in your household himself and right the imbalance, plus him \"coaxing\" the computer away from you just sounds icky and manipulative, but you're also enabling the behavior you're complaining about if your response to him asking the time of the next meal is to consistently volunteer to cook for him. If you want to say no, say no, not yes with the hope that he takes the hint when you don't do it quickly.", "NTA. My 5 year old can make his own PBJ. He makes a huge mess doing it, but he CAN do it. Your spouse absolutely can and should be doing more around the house. He won\u2019t do it because he knows you will.", "ESH\n\nYou are not communicating effectively and you are being contradictory. If you had an important project and you KNEW your husband depended on you to make food, you should have told him as soon as you knew you were working on the project that you wanted him to know upfront, that you will be unable to do the things you normally do, like make food. Especially with his daughter coming over, you needed to make it clear to him that he would be responsible for himself and his daughter when it came to getting something to eat.\n\nThe fact that you still agreed to make sandwiches when you had more important things to get done, and knowing he was doing nothing important is ridiculous, this leads to you \"snapping\" out of nowhere when he asked where the sandwiches were that YOU AGREED to make. On top of that YOU APOLOGISED for \"pushing your duties onto him\" when he should have no issue taking care of his child when you are unable to do so.\n\nYou need to be more clear, set some firm boundaries and tell him that he should not have to be told from now on to pick up slack instead of playing video games.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
