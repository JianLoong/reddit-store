I promised myself that I was never going to grow up and marry someone like my dad. \n\nNow, years later....I'm kind of in that position. It's true that Tom does bring in a lot of money, but so do I. The first year or so was good. Sometimes he forgot things and had to be reminded, but overall he did what he was supposed to. After that, he just started slacking until I was doing the majority of the household chores and work.

He went out with Anna for breakfast, and then came back around noon asking what was for lunch. I told him I would sandwiches or something later because I was busy. He kind of looked at me weirdly, and then went and sat on the couch and played video games while Anna napped. Every once in a while he would look over at me, and then go back to playing video games.

I said I was sorry for trying to push my duties onto him. I had been about to make the sandwiches after a small portion of the work was done, to relax with a bit of cooking before returning to the project, but I then told him that I absolutely would make the sandwiches - but only when all my work was done.

He cleans and not in a way that has to be nagged, he SEES mess and has also understood that he feels better in a cleaner, more organised home. It\u2019s not just possible for a man to cook and clean, it\u2019s an adult minimum. NTA and evaluate what this relationship provides for you", "I dunno man, I do not know.", "Don't forget that he tried to take her laptop from her to MAKE her do lunch. If she hadn't been quick, OP's laptop could have fallen or she could have lost the work she was doing.", "Women who work can leave and support themselves. That's progress. The best question a woman can ask herself is: would my life be simpler, easier, better without him?", "Absolutely. If it's her job, what is the payroll? Salary? Is he an employer? Any contract to demand service? STFU.", "yeah I was screaming inside at that line. like OP, please never apologize to this man ever again in your life. you've apologized too much. it's time to balance the scales\n\nhonestly though it might be easier to just get a divorce", "Ok maybe I wasn't clear. It's not his chores per say. We each have our own chores, true, but then there are some shared chores, like dishes. But we're a team and if he isn't able to do his chores for a good reason like work or other commitments, then I pick up the slack. But that always goes both ways. He does his chores without prompting. If he was just being lazy hoping I would do it, then I wouldn't be married to him. What I'm referring to is more of the shared chores or daily clutter that he seems to accumulate around the house, like leaving Amazon boxes on the dining table, or a forgotten screwdriver on the counter. Although I never have to ask him to do the dishes anymore unless I feel like it's my turn and I'm just really not in the mood to do them. I'm still working on the clutter, lol.", "And that's why we're seeing all those articles pop up in Psychology Today about the rise of lonely single men. Because it is, in fact, easier to do everything on your own *without* an extra grown-ass human draining your physical and emotional resources while treating you like a slave and playing dumb about it. More and more women are realizing that, and the single mom and unmarried cat lady taboos are slowly fading, so we're finally reaching a point where men either have to learn to contribute something other than money to their households or get used to being alone. It's slow progress, but it is glorious.", "And his mum.", "NTA, but you are a naive and you will deserve what you get if you don't grow a backbone and stop doing more than your fair share.\n\n>I guess I kind of stopped asking because it never got anywhere.\n\nYou should have left him instead.\n\n> that cooking was my job (I usually do the cooking and usually it isn't a problem because I like cooking)\n\nWhy?\n\n>I said I was sorry for trying to push my duties onto him. \n\nThis was a mistake.\n\n> but I told him either he finds some other form of food for him and Anna, or they wait.\n\nAt least you have a bit of spine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know why thing have gotten to this point?\n\nBecause you are not willing to leave him over it, so he doesn't need to change, if there are no consequences for poor behaviour people will do whatever they can get away with.\n\nThis isn't about \"treating him like a child\" but like the human animal he is.\n\nWe needed to implement drunk driving laws and speed limits because many people will not do the right thing just because it is the right thing, many, many people will only do what they HAVE to do and if you will pick up his slack then he doesn't HAVE to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnote: all human beings are animals, some are just better trained then others and it seems like you mother and father trained you well for the role you have now.", "WTF did I just read? You apologized to him for trying to get him to do \u2018your\u2019 duties?? FFS! My jaw is on the floor. Can\u2019t he take care of HIS kid? Doesn\u2019t he know how to make a sandwich? But ya know what? You need boundaries. This is pathetic. YTA for not setting boundaries and giving in. You have a project and he is bullying you into making lunch. You both need to have an adult conversation and figure this out. These types of posts make me cringe, especially as OP sounds like she could be a strong and independent woman but needs to grow a spine. Sorry this comes off as harsh but my goodness your husband is a jerk for not being cognizant of your needs with a work project. I hope that he takes care of all his daughters needs and doesn\u2019t pawn her off on you. The child already has parents.\n\n\nETA: After reading the comments it\u2019s worse than I thought. Congratulations OP, you definitely are your mother\u2019s daughter.", "I read a great comment a year or so ago thats stayed with me since.\n\n\"People treat you how you teach them to treat you\".\n\nOP has taught Tom that this is an acceptable way to treat her.", "She even apologized to HIM. That's insane.", "You haven't \"ended up\" anywhere. You are here now, but this is not the end and you are not stuck. You know this isn't acceptable, so the next step is to stop accepting it. I'm sure it'll be hard, because if he doesn't turn it around then you have to make awful choices, but it is worth it to not live the rest of your life this way. Please don't let yourself fall into the sunk cost fallacy, you might be only 1/3 of the way through your life.", "You didn't write her off as collateral damage.  He did.", "Same, like OP this is my biggest nightmare to happen in a future relationship as my parents also have that same dynamic. Recently I was at their place while my sisters were staying from out of town and we were going to head out to do something, and my dad comes by complaining that my mom hadn\u2019t made him a sandwich yet and how can we head out before that. Like holy crap, do it yourself. The cherry on top for me is that he doesn\u2019t work anymore while she does, and yet he still never cooks or does any sort of cleaning or chores. I\u2019ve since found out he\u2019s incredibly misogynistic (not sure how I missed it when I was younger or it\u2019s gotten worse) and so whenever I\u2019m there he expects me to be cooking and cleaning too, and if a sister brings their husband he\u2019ll basically only talk to them. It\u2019s just gross. There might be something underlying there in OP\u2019s situation too, who knows.", "She doesn't need to \"do better\", she's been crushed under hundreds of years of gender conditioning and years of active manipulating and gaslighting by this man. Theres zero chance anyone would \"do better\" in this situation. \n\nAnd she doesn't need therapy, she needs a better partner.", "Taking the laptop away was infuriating to me. like, that is not a *toy,* that is her entire career squeezed into a device the size of a three-subject notebook! he acts like it's a privilege he can take away when she's not doing her Important Wifely Duties but *that is her fucking livelihood.* at the very *least,* he doesn't value her career the way she does. at worst, this might be an early sign of sabotage, leading to eventual financial abuse. I know it's a big jump from what we're seeing here, but we see a lot of this stuff on this sub and that's often where this type of behavior eventually leads.", "You do raise a very fair point! Abuse never starts big. It\u2019s always the small things that seem just a bit out of line, so the victim can slowly get used to it\u2026", "Probably because they're so low effort and simple they're practically lazy. Unless it's some kind of fancy sandwich with a lot of fillings and more steps than just dabbing peanut butter or sticking a slice of cheese on there, sandwiches don't say you care. Lol That's my only interpretation.", "Yes, these are literally two grown adults who both work full time - OP, cooking (and cleaning) isn\u2019t your job, he\u2019s just made it yours by refusing to do it! \n\nIs this what you want for the rest of your life?\n\nNTA", "That made my blood boil! If someone tried to take my laptop while I'm working on something, they probably wouldn't have hands anymore. \n\nIf he pulls something like that again OP should go take the controller out of his hands while he's in the middle of a game.", "NTA He can make a sandwich. More importantly, there needs to be some changes or your marriage is in trouble. You are already resentful, and he acts entitled. He\u2019s not, and you shouldn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019m married 25 years. We don\u2019t have set chores, but when something really needs to get done, you do it. If my husband is busy, I may ask him to do something - when he can. If it can\u2019t wait, it\u2019s on me. Same when things are reversed. We say thank you when the other does something that benefits the household. If I cook, He thanks me. If he fixes something, I thank him. It\u2019s imperfect at times. It\u2019s a PARTNERSHIP.", "He even yelled that cooking is her job... Very entitled guy. Poor woman.", "And also who will have responsibility of the making of the list and keeping it updated? Yeah.", "My parents were the opposite. \n\nI so very vividly remember the ONE time my dad tried to pull that shit on my mom. She had cooked all day and had to run out to get something (to be fair, dad was fixing something in the bathroom so he didnt go out) and he was waiting at the table for her to make his plate. She made herself her own plate, sat down, started to eat and asked him is he broke his arms and legs and was incapable to getting food. As kids do, we laughed. He was so embarrassed, he never did it again", "She was awesome!", "Then thank god that Anna has a mother, and OP\u2019s husband only sees her on the weekends\u2026", "I didn\u2019t read it that way based on what comes next.  I think it was an angry, \u201cFINE.  I\u2019m sOrRy I tried to push my chores on to you. I WAS going to make them after doing part of my work but NOW I\u2019m not going to make them until my work is finished.\u201d  I think OP was shutting him down.", "When your in that kind of a situation it\u2019s hard to see that you are doing it to yourself as well as letting those around you do it as well. I was in a marriage like this for 20 years. It took some good therapy to get out of it and I\u2019m still struggling with some things. I really hope this is a wake up call for her.", "I honestly don't understand some of these dynamics at all.  I'm physically handicapped and I have chronic pain.  I've been off work for the last year recovering.  I recently had a spinal cord stimulator implanted so things are looking up, but I'm basically a stay at home wife that has a lot of bad days. My husband has had to be the main breadwinner and has worked extra hours the last year. I'm the usual cook because I like it and I'm great at it.  On my bad days he takes on extra chores and will cook (I meal plan and have a list of alternate things that he knows how to cook that are available for him to pick from so he knows what ingredients we have left since I shop). This man does so much (I'll be fair I'm a chaos goblin lol) and really takes the in sickness and in health seriously.  I can't imagine having a partner who wouldn't make his own kid a damn sandwich!", "If he won't change, I don't see why OP shouldn't divorce him.  It's literally a complete re-creation of what she was trying to avoid.", "Agree. NTA although, really when he asked the first time you she should have said, \u201cdo it yourself, Boo\u201d.", "Yep. Why TF did OP apologise and agree to make the sandwiches?! Seriously OP you are the asshole to yourself here and you\u2019re letting Tom walk all over you. A grown man can make a sandwich, it\u2019s not even \u201ccooking\u201d.", "Then you end up in a situation where the chores don't get done at all and your house becomes so disgusting you just give in and do everything yourself anyway.\n\nAsk me how I know \u2639\ufe0f", "When my ex was leaving all the work to me, I tried just not doing the chores, but it turned out he really didn't mind if we lived in filth.  After I left, his house got so bad that you honestly couldn't see the floors anymore.", "Yes. Stop. And when he gets mad and you have it out with him and he finally starts helping around the house, wait a couple of months and hire a cleaning lady. You have the money. You work long hours, I bet. You deserve some time to do whatever you want.\n\nFind a meal delivery service, too, if you want that.", "same with saying: okay yea cooking is my job. What?", ">how long did it take for you to be conditioned to stop asking for help?\n\nthey're all \"your\" chores so who the f cares?  Say a re-delegation is happening.  Nothing will change if you enable him.  You are your mother and only you can change that.", "Chore Chicken!! It has a name!!!", "I can't imagine how I'd react to that. Yes I made dinner tonight and served my husband a plate, but he made me breakfast and later a snack and served me. We take turns because we're both adults.", "I think even the 5-year-old could make a simple sandwich, let alone the grown-up man!", "\"MOUN-tain DEW and CHEE-TOS!\"", "\"Eat a sandwich? Believe it or not, jail.\"", "I was about to say... I'm guessing even Anna would be able to make those sandwiches at her age...", "Women used to be completely beholden to men.

My husband pulls his weight because he respects me and he's also very aware I would leave otherwise.", "This is what I got from this too.\n\nI like cooking and do the vast majority of tea (dinner) for my son and husband. However my husband of course does our lunches when he wants to or I am busy (including watching tv). Because he is a capable adult.\n\nNTA OP but your husband is.
