He needs to get out and help your family.  He's probably dealing with depression on some level and it is impeding his focus on what he needs to do.  It's time to have a heart to heart with him about his responsibilities to your family.  If you don't express, clearly, what you have to have from him, your marriage could be circling the drain.

He is like your husband regarding his attitude with jobs and wanting the \"perfect one\". While he didn't get laid off due to something illegal, he has quit jobs that he doesn't like and is very picky about the jobs he's willing to take.\n\nI told him, point blank, that I can't afford our house, mortgage, 2 cars, utilities, and my own bills on my salary so he's going to have to \"suck it up\" and get any job he can (when he's not working his yearly seasonal job from January-July).

It\u2019s not ok to apply for jobs for him. I\u2019m not sure it meets the threshold of illegal, but it\u2019s definitely wrong. He is likely depressed and needs help managing this but he also needs to apply to jobs and take what he can get because it\u2019s much harder to find a job when unemployed to quite some time by choice rather than employed somewhere. I get he thinks the jobs are below him but criminal activity and the misedemaner sort of took away that bargaining chip for him. He has to pay his dues so to speak and in this case it means getting whatever job he can to help support his family.", "NAH! For your own sanity you need to tell him how you feel. Stop paying for anything for him especially non essentials until he starts taking job hunting seriously. \n\nAfter a good sit down you might find out the reason why he is acting the way he is.

I know you said \u201cthe man I married was a hard worker, ambitious\u201d but all I can see from this post is that the man you married is a criminal. You said the crime wasn\u2019t violent, sexual, or theft-related, but you don\u2019t say he was falsely accused. \n\nHe sucks for obvious reasons but I\u2019m saying you suck because you need to stop wasting your time applying for him and just move on.", "Good luck. NTA.", "ESH. You overstepped. He\u2019s not pulling his weight. You can certainly sit down and have a conversation with him about your needs and expectations. He may need professional help, such as a resume writing company or career counselor, and possibly some counselling for the impact the layoff had. All of that needs to come from him though. It is not up to you to dictate where he works.", "Esh\n\nIf he doesnt work at places you cant apply for him, thats ridiculous\n\nDont stay married to him if hes being such a child.  Adults get a job. Any job if they need to pay the bills.  His excuses are lame and hes being an asshole", "ESH, I get why you do it, but it's still not right, and it won't solve anything anyway. If he's already making up excuses for when you suggest jobs or maybe lying about applying for jobs, then he won't go to interviews for the jobs you apply for him either. He might have depression  in which case theraphy should be looked into.", "NAH, whatever happened I\u2019m sure context would color my thoughts, but whatever it was it sounds like he\u2019s taken it on the chin pretty bad recently. He\u2019s your husband, so this is the latter part of for better or worse. Talk to him, try to engage him, set small achievable goals. Sounds like he needs you. Be there. If he\u2019s anything like me he\u2019ll be a complete ass about opening up, but he will eventually. Be his source of strength, not a reason for it.", "ESH- he needs to get a job but he also needs to get therapy, he is obviously going through some mental health issues.\n\nHave you talked to him about getting some help?", "ESH - But I have more sympathy for your position.\n\nWhile his lifestyle changes affect both of you negatively, and requires an adult conversation, you did overstep some boundaries.\n\nThat said, when you're married to someone, and have any level of joined finances, you also share some responsibility towards each other, and so far, it's doubtful that he's trying to meet his part.", "He\u2019s hurt and depressed, but applying for him is not the answer. Sell his car (or yours if it\u2019s the more expensive one). He doesn\u2019t need his car since he won\u2019t work. You don\u2019t need his permission to do that and you need to lighten the load immediately.", "NAH.  You need to have a clear conversation with husband about what his job prospects are.  With a criminal conviction his options may be limited and that may be reason for his avoiding your picks.", "ESH - it's not cool to apply for jobs for him. Why don't you apply for welfare & unemployment for him though? Lol. He is also at fault for not \"lowering himself\" to work at McD's or wherever will hire him.", "Both YTA and NTA. Nta, because of needing him to work to help with bills and life stuff. YTA because of not understanding that part of his life blew up in his face and he probably has trauma over it. Sounds to me he is extremely depressed about what happened and is completely lost mentally. He doest know what to do and has given up. This stage of depression is when addiction, self-harm, hopelessness, and many other things can develop. You are not helping him heal by forcing jobs on him. Sounds to me that you really only care about him when he is giving you a certain type of lifestyle. You also need to realize that he may never be able to work a corporate job again due to his criminal records. Most construction companies may have an issue with it, too.", "YTA.  Sorry, you don't apply for jobs for anyone.  He just lost his job, and that can be one hell of a blow to someone.  He doesn't need someone forcing the issue.  He will rebound at his own pace.  I doubt he is completely aloof to the financial aspect of him losing the job, which means he is probably stressed out which is going to lead to sleeplessness, and possibly gaming during the night to stave off thinking about his problems. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another aspect to the job search too.. This guy was in management.  He could probably go get a wagey job in the blink of an eye, especially now.  The problem with that, and this is incredibly stupid, is that if he takes a wagey job that might sink him, or slow his pace getting back to where he was in industry.  Imagine a hiring manager looking at his resume.. going from department manager, to Arby's clerk, applying for another managerial job...   All of this with a criminal record that he'd likely have to explain...  Money is money, and job a job to me, but for some guys, titles matter, and sitting on the couch is better than taking a lesser job that will stunt his career path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne final consideration.  Maybe that job broke him, or perhaps the incident that caused him to lose that job...  Maybe he is fundamentally broken at this point trying to figure out what the the next best move is, or if he even wants to continue playing...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever the case may be, he doesn't likely need additional stress or pressure put on him in the form of you taking the initiative for him to apply for jobs he is not right for, and may not even want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She didn't force the issue, she just let me work through the depression, anxiety, and shit in general of giving so much, receiving so little, and in thanks being sent to the unemployment line.
