{"id": 33450, "submission_id": "18n2xlf", "title": "AITA for saying refusing to host a Christmas party", "selftext": "I (27M) have been dating Kate (26F) for two years. Kate\u2019s mom Donna as well as the rest of Kate\u2019s family has been very welcoming to me, but in the last year, I\u2019ve grown to be a bit cautious of Donna. Mostly some small tendencies she has, like inviting herself along on trips and date night plans that Kate and I have, and expecting us (me specifically most of the time) to cover her every cost. She comes off a bit controlling too sometimes and so I\u2019m not a huge fan of Donna.\n\nAnyways last Christmas was the first Christmas I spent with Kate\u2019s family. Everyone was nice and I had a good time. At one point Donna\u2019s mom made a comment to everyone in the room that \u201cChristmas will be on Dan (me) next year\u201d and everyone cheered, because around that time I had just moved into a pretty spacious loft/apartment and it\u2019s a great spot for hosting big get togethers. I just chuckled thinking nothing serious of it. But then a few times throughout this year,  she again in a very unserious and a joking tone mentioned to other people in my presence that \u201cChristmas is on Dan this year!\u201d. No other elaboration, just a declaration.  Each time I just laughed and thought/said nothing about it, so did Kate.\n\nWell lo and behold, turns out Donna was completely serious and was expecting me to host her family of over 50+ people at my apartment this year, including taking care of food for everyone and lodging for some of the out of town guests. I found out because she texted Kate asking how early she can arrive on Christmas for the \u201cparty\u201d. Both Kate and I were completely unaware she was serious and had already invited everyone in the family. I have the space for it, but I am completely unprepared, and my schedule is also fully booked with extra shifts at work and plans to see my family and friends, I wasn\u2019t even planning on going to Kate\u2019s family\u2019s Christmas this year, let alone host it myself! At no point did anyone sit Kate or I down and ask seriously to host and discuss logistics. Kate is also completely unavailable host by herself at my place since she is working, and we are both financially strapped to afford food for a party of 50+ people too. There\u2019s only a few days till Christmas and there\u2019s no way we can plan it now, and also just on principal too I don\u2019t like being back into it this way. Both Kate and I said no, and Donna is pretty upset at us but more so at me. Kate\u2019s annoyed with the way her mother is acting, but also she\u2019s frankly very busy with her job this week to focus her energy to this (our dog passed last week too so Kate's been a wreck). Because I am not hosting it at my place, Donna or the rest of the family don\u2019t have a spot where they can host that many people. But still, I refuse to cancel my plans and give into hosting.  I do love Kate and am serious about a future with her, am I being an asshole and should I just bite the bullet and figure out a way to host?", "created_utc": 1703100423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n2xlf/aita_for_saying_refusing_to_host_a_christmas_party/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But Kate needs to be the one to handle her mother's craziness.", "NTA - a party that big does require planning and logistics.  The fact that no one said anything until this point is just rude and entitled.  At the end of the day, you just can't host.  And it's not because of lack of planning, it's because BOTH you and Kate have work.\n\nETA:  My heart goes out to you two for losing your pet.  Doesn't make this time of year any easier.  All the best, OP.", "NTA and you need to have a SERIOUS talk with Kate.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground and don\u2019t give in. You give in this time and you\u2019ll always be hosting. \n\nIf Kate has a key to your place I would temporarily take it back. I wouldn\u2019t trust Donna to not take the key or manipulate Kate to give it to her so they can force you to host by gaining access.", "NTA. If you let Donna win this one, she will OWN you for the rest of her life (or as long as you are with her daughter). Think about that long and hard. If she wins, you lose FOREVER.", "INFO: did Kate really have no idea that her mom was serious about this?   \n\n\nBecause I would think that when Donna repeated her assertion throughout the year, that your gf would've said something to her about it. It seems unlikely that Donna wasn't doing weird shit like this before that would clue Kate in about this being \"real\" for Donna.", "NTA.\n\n50 people is A LOT. If I was one of the 50, I wouldn't be expecting to show up at your place without a proper invite *from you*.", "NTA\nDon't be an idiot l,  there's no need to \"figure out a way to host\". Donnas plan,  donnas problem. And you (both, you and Kate) need to put down boundaries about her mother inviting herself places. Be prepared for people to turn up looking for the accommodation Donna promised and turn them away.  Donna is controlling and she will only get worse. It might be time for Kate to  seek therapy to recognize her mother's treatment of you both and her demands are unreasonable. Don't let this woman step all over you.", "NTA probably should have shot her down when she first brought it up, but she's the unreasonable one here", "NTA --- You give in to this now and she will be walking all over you and Kate for the rest of your lives, stick to your guns NO means NO and besides you said yourself that not only do you have to work you also have other plans.", "NTA \n\nNot only about this situation, but the whole context. In which world does a mother comes along her daughter to her dates with her bf ? This is intrusive and rude. \n\nThe fact you never discussed and planned Christmas with her makes her the AH... An assertive and delusional one, I think. Plus, there is a huge difference between hosting a small Christmas and a whole family Christmas (50 + people ? What was Donna thinking ?)", "NTA\n\nThis is nutso behavior.", "NTA. Donna sounds like she may come from a background she either was catered to a lot or expected men to often take the lead role on things, perhaps something cultural, or it could be has had a good deal of deprivation that has caused her to develop tactics to try to get her needs met, your mentioning her being controlling is also indicative of possibly some kind of trauma. It's a tough situation to be in as you want to keep on good terms and I agree with your refusing to throw a party you didn't agree to throw in the first place. Perhaps going forward being clear and communicating politely with every instance of these \"jokes\" you do not agree with what she is saying may be helpful?", "NTA. IF you really are going to join this family you need to set boundaries and not allow Donna to bully you. Set boundaries and enforce them, every single time, without fail. Its the only thing that works with a bully.", "Nta. If you give in now it'll never get better. You figuratively need to piss around your home and mark it as your territory. Set and enforce boundaries and expectations", "ESH (mostly mom)\n\nHer mom is controlling, etc but when you realized she was REPEATING this -- and you already knew she was controlling -  it was naive to ignore it.

You can't cancel something you never planned on. Donna volunteering you to host 50 people for dinner, and some even to stay at your place, is so absurd that of course you and your girlfriend thought she had to be joking. No sane person with normal boundaries would be so bold and absurd.\n\nTell everyone that there was a mixup, and that to make it up them, Donna has volunteered to treat everyone to an all expenses trip to Disney World.", "NTA.  You didn't volunteer for this and no one should expect that you'll host, especially for that many people.  If you do find a way it'll probably the the beginning of many of these expectations.  If you can, stop it before it gets started.", "Donna will find a way of making you the bad guy for canceling. I'd plan on Chinese take-out for 50. You will technically perform the hosting duties, but remind everyone it was Donna's idea and she insisted despite your protests, so you just did the best you could. Maybe set up a memorial wall and shrine for your late dog (sorry for your loss). Either you start a new no-cook tradition, or everyone learns not to make plans based upon what Donna says.

You must stand your ground with Donna, otherwise she will always make demands.  She might always be demanding anyhow, Kate can give you more insight.  I\u2019m glad you and Kate agree on this.  You may want to talk to Kate, be sure she is ok with all the drama, key is secure from Donna, etc.  also worthwhile to send a text to everyone \u201cHey , we\u2019re sorry for the misunderstanding.  We never offered or agreed to host, we thought Donna was joking.  We wish all of you a very happy Christmas and hope to see you soon. In the future, when we host family we\u2019ll always communicate with each of you directly.\u201d  Kate hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, so don\u2019t automatically take her key of change the locks, implying you don\u2019t trust her and blame her for this mess.  Just keep talking, as long as she is solidly on your side you are good.  And if Kate waivers, remember she knows her mom is wrong and unreasonable, but this is her whole family being manipulated against her and that hurts. A lot.  So be kind to Kate, mom is putting her through hell right now.", "Last time I checked, basic etiquette is that the HOST does the invites. Pretty crazy that someone who doesn't live with you can invite 50+ people over? and expect you to foot the bill? If this were how the world worked, I think we'd all be at our favourite celebrity's house for dinner ha ha.... if you and Kate (and especially Kate) let Donna come out on top of this one, it'll be a pretty dangerous precedent for your future together. Biting the bullet sounds like a temporary solution, but it will have long term consequences.", "NTA. Someone had enough room last year, or did Donna expand the guest list?

SHE invited 50 people (her friends and family), and never said, hey, OP how many people are you inviting to this party you're paying for and hosting.\n\nNo party, no kidding.", "NTA... No way can you start allowing her to dictate your holidays. Just say it was never in your plans.", "NTA. I wouldn't want 50 people I like in my house at the same time. I agree with the others that your GF needs to handle her mom.", "Fortunately, it doesn't seem like Kate is upset with you about it. Let Kate tell Donna that she screwed the pooch on this one and invited 50 plus family members to some else's apartment without ANY communication with the host. She really is a piece of work.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Grow a spine. You need to stand up to Donna; you also need to learn to communicate your boundaries. When she repeated that you were hosting, you should have said something.  Donna is one of those people who will take a mile if you give them an inch. STOP giving in to her!!!", "NTA\n\nNo one gets to invite a whole bunch of people to a party at your home and your expense except you.\n\nShe needs some boundaries setting now. You don't invite someone for a Christmas meal then tell them they are hosting 50 people in return. \n\nNo is a sentence. She can explain how it is there's no party.", "I agree.  If you cave on this, Donna will walk all over you for the rest of your relationship with Kate.\n\nForget getting Kate's key back - just replace the locks altogether and make sure you have a ring camera.

The mom clearly has some issues with control and boundaries, so if you bite the bullet on this I think you're just going to have more issues down the line, until some point when you do have to confront her on something. I would use this as an opportunity to set proper boundaries now, if you are serious about a future with Kate.", "If there is a family chat it would be prudent for Kate to post about the \"misunderstanding\" on it.\n\nYou should still change your locks, in the oft chance that Donna has managed to sneak a key.  If possible, get a door camera, too.\n\nI doubt that Donna will confess her misjudgement to the people who are invited, and will make up a cockamamie story about the situation which leaves her as the hero and you and GF as the villains.  Either that, or she'll just bring everybody and try to force her way inside.\n\nIf you stay and open the door even a bit *when, not if they come*, she will stick her paw inside to keep the door open.  If you leave, it's entirely possible that she will break in.\n\nDon't give in to this pressure, OP, or you'll be her victim forever.  Let her try to have them in her home.....er.....*den*.  She apparently was raised by wolves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Give in this time and pay for it later.", "How many people were at the party last year? Was it at Donna's house?", "NTA. Hell to the No! Any communication that comes to you, be VERY CLEAR that you did not authorize anything to be at your home.\n\nYou have just learnt that silence = consent, so ensure you speak up in the future.\n\nI agree. Kate needs to contact her mother and EVERYONE that this was arranged without your consent and it is not happening. I hope she can be trusted to have a backbone cause her mother sounds like she does this all the time and people allow her.\n\nPut an extra deadbolt on your place as well that only YOU have the key, in addition to cameras. Also put a sign on your door that there are security cameras and anyone who enters will be arrested for trespassing.\n\nShut this nonsense down now!", "NTA-if you change your mind and agree, you will be labeled a push-over by her mom. What\u2019s next, when you buy a fancy car, it belongs to Donna too? (Like my MIL with my not so fancy civic). Don\u2019t do it. Stand your ground now for your future.", "How freaking wild is it that she assumed her daughters boyfriend would foot the bill for her entire extended family's Christmas?? The repeated 'Christmas is ON Dan' comments... like it's bad enough to just voluntold you to host but also to pay for food for FIFTY when you aren't even related? Wild.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in \u201cstart as you mean to go on\u201d and if you cave this time then you are just opening the door for Donna to pull stunts like this again.

Allowing her mother to crash your dates is not ok.", "NTA and its kates responsibility to deal with her crazy mum", "Kate has abdicated her role on this. That's not cool.  Bad time or not,  SHE needs to step up or you have a future of doing all the hard lifting in the relationship", "NTA op and it seems as if Donna is trying to use you,have a sit down with Kate and let her know she needs to set boundaries with her family,goodluck.", "NTA \n\nActually, this is PERFECT! By the sound of it Donna is used to just shoe-horning/weight-of-expectations/bullying people into doing what she wants. \n\nWhat do you mean you didn't pick up on her indirect directions and make her wants real?  /s\n\nWhen I say it's perfect, I mean that this is an excellent way to teach her to communicate properly, even if it was unintentional!\n\nHold the line! Blank looks and uncomprehending stares unless Donna has actual conversations. \n\nYou have unintentionally given your future with your lady a big boost. Because you're training your manipulative and controlling MIL early :)"]}
