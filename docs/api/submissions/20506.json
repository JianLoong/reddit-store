For me it\u2019s not a sex or safety thing it\u2019s that the men your work place are obviously not house broken. Everyone switches the ladies will smell like the men\u2019s in no time.

You just recently started a job and this is the hill you want to die on lol?\n\nGood luck making it past your probationary period haha!", "YTA for taking a woman's designated space when you COULD use the other one, you just don't want to.  So when a woman needs to use the facility, she'll have to wait on a man.  No thanks.  The reporting was fair.", "NTA, I honestly don\u2019t see the big deal.

Male urine smells much more strongly (sometimes due to missing the bowl/urinal) than women\u2019s, so the smell you have in the men\u2019s room is men.  Now you are forcing the women you work with to tolerate a smell because you can\u2019t figure out how to get a bathroom cleaned.\n\nI\u2019ve worked places where the women are responsible for their bathroom and they keep it clean until it is invaded by men who find it \u201cnicer\u201d because they refuse to do the labor of cleaning their own space and just want to enjoy a clean space without effort.  YTA and honestly, it being a single stall doesn\u2019t negate the extra work (and smell) your urine creates.  \n\nHave you thought of a different job since this one is so disgusting?", "YTA.", "NTA.

Imo we should get rid of all urinals and only make stalls. Preferably single room stalls.

It\u2019s a single stall bathroom, so everyone\u2019s privacy is protected. I don\u2019t get why single stalls are gendered, anyway. This is coming from a woman. If I see a guy in line for a men\u2019s single stall restroom I\u2019ll tell them to use the women\u2019s one before me. They\u2019ve been waiting longer, it\u2019s only fair.", "NTA. Everyone deserves a hygienic restroom. This is tricky tho.\n\nYou attempted to correct a problem you did not cause, and when pushed back, you found your own solution. You tried to be empathetic and aware about sharing a space with women, but everyone has different boundaries surrounding this and that\u2019s ok. \nShame nobody tried to talk to you about it before reporting but maybe you\u2019re really scary looking & hard to approach lol\n\nSad to see everyone putting this on you, when it\u2019s the company that is failing everyone here. Persist with the cleaning request (maybe hunt down the custodian) and do your best to prove the state of the bathroom is substandard.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nSome people just want to feel like they're doing something. \n\nInstead of something important like cleaning the community, advocating against racism or charity to a just cause they report people at work who aren't harming anyone and get their jollies all the same.
