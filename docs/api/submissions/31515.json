I know her for around 4 years since I married her mother. The issue, though, is that we've never gotten along well.\n\nI have tried, but she always says that she doesn't like me and wants her \"real\" Dad. When I try to tell her stuff or scold her for behaving out of order, she'd say \"You are not my father, you're just some stranger\". My wife Emily asked her to behave properly as well, but she doesn't care to listen and in the end she stopped telling her as well.\n\nI had to pick Hannah up at school once, and when a couple of people who did not know I was her step-Dad asked her who I was, she said \"Oh, he's a servant, actually\" in front of my face. I was extremely mad at that and it even resulted in a huge argument, although she played it off as a \"joke\". But this was the last straw and that happened a good few months back. After that I have always treated her as if she's invisible and barely had any interactions with her unless absolutely necessary.\n\nWell, she talked to me presently and said she's got to apply to college & wants me to pay her fees now. I refused and asked her to ask her \"real Dad\" (who refused to pay for it himself). She began to protest and said I am affecting her education and that I cannot do that. But I did not relent and said she's not my business now.\n\nMy wife says refusing to pay is wrong and that I overreacted even though she's not been nice to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700684327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181ilw9/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_stepdaughters/", "score": 4636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her you can't afford it on your servants' wages. \n\nSeriously, her two birth parents have had 18 years to save up for her college education. You have had four years of putting up with her rudeness, with no backup or support from your wife, her mother, and she has the temerity to speak to you now that she wants your money. Now she can have four years of missing out on her dream college and think over how treating someone as less than human isn't a good life strategy.", "NTA - She\u2019s going to refuse to accept you as her parent and degrade and disrespect you 24/7, including in front of other people. Yet, she wants one of the biggest benefits of you technically being her parent. She\u2019s clearly being selfish and manipulative and I\u2019m not surprised her mother is defending her given how her daughter acts. In the end, it\u2019s your money and you\u2019re entitled to spend it however you please. And I would also beg of you to not pay jack shit regarding her college. Like I said, she refuses to treat you like her parent but at the same time expects all the benefits of you being her parent.

Even if you and Hannah had a great relationship, there will still be zero obligation for you to pay for her college.", "It looks like Hannah finally learned a good adult lesson about consequences. At 18, she is not owed money by anyone and if you ruin a relationship then you risk not being helped in times of need.\n\nIt must have felt good to tell that brat she should fix her own education.\n\nWhere was your wife in the last 4 years and why is she not backing you up here?

Why, if you're so irrelevant to her, would she even think to ask (no i'm sorry, demand) you to pay it? Same question for your wife just worded differently..why should you??  The only reason your wife is taking her side is because she knows she can't pay it and wants you to. But that doesn't mean you have to or should. Stand your ground. Actions have consequences.

The issue, though, is that we've never gotten along well.\n\nI have tried, but she always says that she doesn't like me and wants her \"real\" Dad. When I try to tell her stuff or scold her for behaving out of order, she'd say \"You are not my father, you're just some stranger\". My wife Emily asked her to behave properly as well, but she doesn't care to listen and in the end she stopped telling her as well.\n\nI had to pick Hannah up at school once, and when a couple of people who did not know I was her step-Dad asked her who I was, she said \"Oh, he's a servant, actually\" in front of my face. I was extremely mad at that and it even resulted in a huge argument, although she played it off as a \"joke\". But this was the last straw and that happened a good few months back. After that I have always treated her as if she's invisible and barely had any interactions with her unless absolutely necessary.\n\nWell, she talked to me presently and said she's got to apply to college & wants me to pay her fees now. I refused and asked her to ask her \"real Dad\" (who refused to pay for it himself). She began to protest and said I am affecting her education and that I cannot do that. But I did not relent and said she's not my business now.\n\nMy wife says refusing to pay is wrong and that I overreacted even though she's not been nice to me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is so clearly not the daughter's fault, shes a teenager acting out in a situation that is clearly stressful to her, but everyone is blaming her.

Thank you.", "Love doesn't appear out of nowhere, even love for children. There has to be love first, built on some foundation, before you can love someone through transgressions. There is none here.

What you are suggesting is naive and  not  plausible. \n\nHe didn't come into her life when she was a sweet child he could care for, spend time with and grow to love her and there is no genetic connection where someone can maybe be innately hardwired to love a child because you made them. No. She was a mean, nasty 14 year old who went out of her way to make sure he knew he wasn't wanted. How could love grow from such conditions?

And have absolutely no idea what it's like to work hard, and have to support someone who treats you like shit. Literally giving away hours of your life to pay for someone who thinks so little of you that her friends don't even know you exist. And then to turn around and expect that same person to spend his entire salary for 1-4 years (do t know how much he makes) so that she can go to school for free.\n\nAnd for her to feel entitled to OPs money, after the way she's treated him. Knowing that neither of her actual parents will help is astounding. Like she could have done absolutely nothing, and probably would have gone to college still.  Instead she took every opportunity to remind him how little he means to her, how little she thinks of him, and how he isn't her parent, and is little more than a stranger.

Jesus.", "So very true. I've been a full-time single parent to my kid since they were 2.5 years old. They're almost 18 now. We're very close, and there has always been a lot of good-natured teasing and giving each other ridiculous nicknames. We know what lines not to cross and what constitutes sensitive subjects, though, so as to never actually hurt the other person. It's just a fun, unique way we show that we care. There is a huge difference between affectionate teasing and outright malice, though. This kid sounds awful, and OP owes her nothing considering the abuse he's tolerated from her.  NTA", "Yes, at least given the relationship between him and the girl (or lack thereof). I mean, my stepmother regards me as her own and I regard her as a much-beloved additional parent whom I've been lucky enough to have in my life since I was twelve. She has had no hesitation about her joint money with my father helping to pay for my children's college education, because although their father and I have put aside as much as we can, major medical problems have sapped a lot of that money, as our first objective had to be getting one of my kids through to college age alive. \n\nBut that's a situation in which both I and her grandchildren love her and treat her as an adored stepmother and Nana. She welcomed me as an exciting extra family member, not tolerated baggage, when she got involved with my father; and I welcomed her as an exciting extra family member in return. We've long since become as close as blood family to each other, and the children have grown up with her as a grandma since their birth. She also knows we really did try to handle it ourselves, and circumstances made that impossible. \n\nIt's a very different situation from the real parents not bothering, while the child makes super clear that stepdad is not a real parent.", "Well they also have to claim you as a dependent vis a vis Fed taxes.

I'm really happy to have that relationship with my stepdaughter. Her favourite thing right now is to mock my height (she's 10 and already taller than me, nooooo!), and in turn I threaten to sell her to the circus. But we both know it's all for fun and I check in with her from time to time to make sure she's still good with it. I feel so sad for poor OP for what he's dealing with :(", "Agreed. You are all loving family with a long history and because of that, stepmom/nana is fully on board with helping out the grandkids. Far different from OP, who has only known SD for 4 years, with stepdaughter having no respect or regard for him.", "Yes. You can't reasonably demand that somebody act as a loving family member when their every attempt to be one over the years has been shut down rudely and vehemently."]}
