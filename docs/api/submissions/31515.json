I know her for around 4 years since I married her mother. The issue, though, is that we've never gotten along well.\n\nI have tried, but she always says that she doesn't like me and wants her \"real\" Dad. When I try to tell her stuff or scold her for behaving out of order, she'd say \"You are not my father, you're just some stranger\". My wife Emily asked her to behave properly as well, but she doesn't care to listen and in the end she stopped telling her as well.\n\nI had to pick Hannah up at school once, and when a couple of people who did not know I was her step-Dad asked her who I was, she said \"Oh, he's a servant, actually\" in front of my face. I was extremely mad at that and it even resulted in a huge argument, although she played it off as a \"joke\". But this was the last straw and that happened a good few months back. After that I have always treated her as if she's invisible and barely had any interactions with her unless absolutely necessary.\n\nWell, she talked to me presently and said she's got to apply to college & wants me to pay her fees now. I refused and asked her to ask her \"real Dad\" (who refused to pay for it himself). She began to protest and said I am affecting her education and that I cannot do that. But I did not relent and said she's not my business now.\n\nMy wife says refusing to pay is wrong and that I overreacted even though she's not been nice to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700684327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181ilw9/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_stepdaughters/", "score": 2342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her you can't afford it on your servants' wages. \n\nSeriously, her two birth parents have had 18 years to save up for her college education. You have had four years of putting up with her rudeness, with no backup or support from your wife, her mother, and she has the temerity to speak to you now that she wants your money. Now she can have four years of missing out on her dream college and think over how treating someone as less than human isn't a good life strategy.", "NTA - She\u2019s going to refuse to accept you as her parent and degrade and disrespect you 24/7, including in front of other people. Yet, she wants one of the biggest benefits of you technically being her parent. She\u2019s clearly being selfish and manipulative and I\u2019m not surprised her mother is defending her given how her daughter acts. In the end, it\u2019s your money and you\u2019re entitled to spend it however you please. And I would also beg of you to not pay jack shit regarding her college. Like I said, she refuses to treat you like her parent but at the same time expects all the benefits of you being her parent.

Even if you and Hannah had a great relationship, there will still be zero obligation for you to pay for her college.", "It looks like Hannah finally learned a good adult lesson about consequences. At 18, she is not owed money by anyone and if you ruin a relationship then you risk not being helped in times of need.\n\nIt must have felt good to tell that brat she should fix her own education.\n\nWhere was your wife in the last 4 years and why is she not backing you up here?

Why, if you're so irrelevant to her, would she even think to ask (no i'm sorry, demand) you to pay it? Same question for your wife just worded differently..why should you??  The only reason your wife is taking her side is because she knows she can't pay it and wants you to. But that doesn't mean you have to or should. Stand your ground. Actions have consequences.

The issue, though, is that we've never gotten along well.\n\nI have tried, but she always says that she doesn't like me and wants her \"real\" Dad. When I try to tell her stuff or scold her for behaving out of order, she'd say \"You are not my father, you're just some stranger\". My wife Emily asked her to behave properly as well, but she doesn't care to listen and in the end she stopped telling her as well.\n\nI had to pick Hannah up at school once, and when a couple of people who did not know I was her step-Dad asked her who I was, she said \"Oh, he's a servant, actually\" in front of my face. I was extremely mad at that and it even resulted in a huge argument, although she played it off as a \"joke\". But this was the last straw and that happened a good few months back. After that I have always treated her as if she's invisible and barely had any interactions with her unless absolutely necessary.\n\nWell, she talked to me presently and said she's got to apply to college & wants me to pay her fees now. I refused and asked her to ask her \"real Dad\" (who refused to pay for it himself). She began to protest and said I am affecting her education and that I cannot do that. But I did not relent and said she's not my business now.\n\nMy wife says refusing to pay is wrong and that I overreacted even though she's not been nice to me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You do not have that information, and you know what happens when you assume\u2026", "You technically should use the income of the household you primarily live with or the parent who provides the most support if the time is equal, but when you're considered dependent for FASFA until 24, you might not even live with either parent at all. Honestly, who's even checking in this busted, fucked up system? I didn't live at home when I started college but still \"dependent\", and nobody batted an eye when I used my dad's income, though we live 1000 miles apart.", "Round of applause.", "Do you know how many people, including women, pay for school without resorting to sex work? Hint: it's most of them.", "She doesn't have to go to school.", "It requires both sides to want a relationship for it to work. There clearly isn\u2019t one here. Otherwise it\u2019s just the OP forcing a relationship (unwanted) and money (wanted). She\u2019s an adult and has made her choice clearly. Notice how clearly none of her retorts involve a mention of her relationship with the OP.", "LOL it happens", "I'd argue calling someone who is coming to pick you up from school \"a servant\" goes into disrespecting them as a person.", "Awww poor widdle girl. She didn't get money from her servant? Awwwwww", "Figure what out exactly ? How not to get called a servant in public?", "Guess we should agree to disagree because I wouldn't empathize with someone who been disrespectful to me for years. \n\nAs a child of divorce I know my trauma doesn't give me the ok to be rude and disrespectful to people", "Again, I said he's already made an effort for 4 years.", "Which in all my comments where I mentioned him having his own account he's nta. I asked because that's a valid question", "She\u2019s 18. He\u2019s her step-dad. You obviously have 0 life experience to be making these claims.", "No, poor little girl, her mom moved a dictatorial asshole into her house who tried to scold her into acting the way he wanted.\n\nAnd how many times do I have to say I don't judge him about the money at all.  She acted out because he was an asshole, and he responded by pouting and pretending she wasn't there making him and even bigger asshole.  All of that went down before the money was an issue.", "His poor little feelings got so hurt by this that he has decided to never be kind to his stepchild ever again. It's dumb, you're not even fit to be a parent if you don't know that teens say stupid or insensitive things, I'm pretty sure everyone else figured that out when rhey were kids.", "And as an adult who has been parachuted into Hannah's life, OP doesn't get the OK to scold her and treat her like she's invisible. He sounds like a child.", "That's not how relationships work, especially with your spouse's child. You don't just get to tap out because your feelings were hurt.", "Maybe read my comments before insulting me based on my assumed age all the time? All of my replies have been civil responses and yours have been retorts based on my age. Says more about you than me.", "She acted out because she\u2019s an asshole.", "I love how people act like feelings are bad thing whenever it comes to men. \n\nI agree of someone repeatedly over the course of 4 years is never kind to me why would I be kind to them.  Yes once and a whole loss are jerks but if it's repeated, why do they deserve a pass?", "Just a difference of opinion here", "[https://www.choosingtherapy.com/grey-rock-method/](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/grey-rock-method/)\n\nOP has chosen the gray rock method of dealing with this. Not childish at all.", "It is how relationships work. If my mom treats me like shit for 4 years I'm going to cut her off. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Or do you think I should stick around and be abused/mistreated?", "You say that like someone who has always had at least one parent on your side.  How nice for you.", "Uh, I'm a man and sensitive and a fool, I'm not criticizing this dude for being a man. I'm criticizing him for being weird and a terrible and childish parent.", "He's not a parent......she made that clear to him. \n\nBut hey let's just agree to disagree :)"]}
