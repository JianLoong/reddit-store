So maybe I'm not the best of judge in his situation.", "Okay first of all who tf doesnt answer the calls from the person watching their children?? Thats disturbing yikes. \n\nYoure not an idiot for following rules given to you about someone else home. Thats insane. \n\nNever babysit for your sister again. \n\nNTA", "Honestly NTA because you were following instructions. You had no way of knowing who this woman was or if she was telling the truth", "NTA\n\nUnless it was freezing cold, or super hot, giving her a chair and offering water so she can wait outside is all you needed to do for the neighbor. \n\nYour sister absolutely should have answered her phone, though, while you were watching her kids. That's not ok -- I would not watch her kids again.", ">she didn\u2019t think that she needed to tell me her 7 month pregnant neighbor in distress was an exception to the rule. \n\nUh, actually yeah she did need to specify that? She told you no strangers, and she was a stranger to you. How would you know if she was actually the neighbor, you don't live here.\n\nLet's be honest, if something happened to the kids because of her she would have blamed you for letting her inside, pregnant and distressed or not. NTA. \n\nHowever, couldn't you ask the kids if they recognized her? You haven't specified their age or if they are verbal so I'm just asking", "NTA. You were trusted with your sisters children and took precaution to ensure their safety. Tough circumstance, but you did the right thing", "I don\u2019t care if you are autistic or not. You absolutely did the right thing. Your sister is TA for not letting you have a friend over, since you were doing her a favor and she is presumably not paying you. If she\u2019s paying you, then I retract that part of it. \n\nShe\u2019s also TA for lashing out at you when she was very clear in the instructions. And yes, with all types of crime going on today, it is quite possible that this could have been a ruse to get inside your house and do, who knows what?  I think you did quite well, considering everything.  I wonder whom your sister is going to get to babysit in the future.", "NTA. You did your best to make her comfortable, tried calling your sister to confirm she was who she said she was, and you kept the kids safe. This is exactly what you were supposed to do. You had no way of knowing who she was, so you did the right thing by not letting her in. I am pregnant and I would have definitely understood in that situation. I might have been upset at the situation ( it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to make me cry these days ) but I certainly wouldn\u2019t have blamed you. I also would have been grateful for your help in offering a chair, food, and water. Your really did the right thing and handled a tough situation well. I am sorry that your sister and your parents reacted the way they did, that was not fair.", "NTA, & your sister & parents are absolutely wrong to attack you over this. They *know* you're very literal-minded! If there were to be any exceptions, that should have been made plain up front. No people in her house means no people in her house, & within the limitations of that hard rule you did what you could to be helpful.", "Nta....i agree with all the comments....parents regardless of date night or not need to be available to the one person who has their kids.", "As a father of 4 children with autism: you're NTA.\n\nAlthough I understand your sister and parents complaint to not take everything so literally. I can headbutt myself about that on many occasion. But it's just the way your brain works. \n\nYou didn't know the neighbour, you had clear orders about strangers. You even tried to inform your sister and parents which is very good. You were willing to help. Chances could be she was a crook, and then what would your sister say?", "NTA - you did what you were told to do and kept the safety of those children the priority. The situation about the woman\u2019s keys inside her home is unfortunate but not your responsibility to fix. \nAlso, TA is your sister for not picking up the phone after multiple calls! If something had happened with with kids she would\u2019ve been unreachable. What parent doesn\u2019t answer the phone when their babysitter calls!?! Idc if it\u2019s date night, those are your kids and that\u2019s your home and are always a priority.", "NTA. You did what you were told, and even offered her a chair + food & water. Why she didn\u2019t try another neighbour is beyond me.", "NTA - I do not know if its the same where you live, but here - its common for women, mothers, older women, pregnant ladies to come and knock and ask for help with something inconsequential and later commit crimes - mostly robbery. You did right by not opening up the door, if something had happened to the kids - they would have undoubtedly blamed you. \n\nI would have assumed your family members to understand this honestly - maybe think twice before babysitting your sister's kids again.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t know her, and you weren\u2019t comfortable letting her into the home and your sister didn\u2019t answer the phone.\n\nWhat strikes me as odd is why didn\u2019t she seek help from any other neighbors.", "NTA. You did what she told you to do. It sounds like your parents and sister don\u2019t understand autism otherwise they would know you take things literally and have a very difficult time recognizing exceptions to rules. And it was irresponsible of your sister to not answer your phone calls. She could have prevented the situation if she had answered or called you back quickly.", "NTA. You are not an idiot, you did your best and your sister should have answered her phone when her babysitter was calling.", "NTA. You did not know if this woman was lying and how on earth did your sister ignore your calls the first time you babysit for her?  She is the AH here.", "NTA. You did what you were told. You aren\u2019t a mind reader.", "NTA. Call 911 next time.", "NTA\n\nIt's her neighboor not yours... to you is just a stranger.\n\nDon't ever babysit for that ungratefull b ever again\n\nAnd you could basically call CPS since your sister left her baby with someone with no expertise on how take care of a baby.", "NTA. Your sister gave you some hard rules and didn\u2019t give you discretionary leeway. You tried to get guidance from your sister and parents, but neither were available. \n\nYou did the best you could, offering some assistance, and your family is lashing out at you because they\u2019re mostly upset with themselves, both for not answering and for not considering your literal nature when giving such strict guidelines to prevent you from having friends over. \n\nSince this was the first time you\u2019ve done this, they should\u2019ve planned to be available at least by phone. They should always have an emergency contact available when someone else watches their kids.", "Definitely NTA. If your sister had answered and could have proven it was actually her neighbor, it would have been fine to let her in, but you didn't know this woman. Not everyone is who they say they are.\n\nAnd honestly, your sister is a giant AH for not answering the phone the entire night! What if it had been an emergency with her child? And your parents didn't answer either? What's wrong with your family?", "NTA. People have used this as a scam to get into people\u2019s houses before. You did what you were told. Your sister wasn\u2019t available when you called, which someone needs to be if you\u2019re watching their children. You don\u2019t know her neighbours and can\u2019t be expected to make accommodations for people you don\u2019t know - strangers. Not your fault, you did your job.", "NTA   \nAutistic or not the rule was very clear, \"No strangers in the house\" is everybody that you don\u00b4t know.   \nI would have definitely done the same, how are you supposed to know your sisters neighbours?? Or that this wasn\u00b4t a very common scam? They are completely out of line to treat you like that.", "NTA\n\nThis is a common tactic used by thieves. You use a pregnant woman, because who wouldn\u2019t want to help a pregnant woman. You did the right thing. The only thing you may have done, is ask her a question only she would know to verify that she was telling the truth. Other than that you acted responsibly.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, your sister had clearly stated that under no circumstances were you to allow strangers into her home.\n\nOkay, so the lady was a next door neighbour - at least she claimed to be. Since you say she told you she was the next door neighbour, I get the impression that you didn't recognise her. So unless she showed you her ID and proved her address, you only had her word that she was the neighbour, not a thief with a good story trying to get in the house.  And even if she showed you the ID to prove she was a neighbour, this wouldn't automatically prove she was known to your sister and your sister would welcome her coming into the house.\n\nSecondly, your sister did not pick up your calls.\n\nYou were babysitting your sister's kids for the first time alone. Imo, it didn't matter whether this was the 1st or the 101st time you were babysitting the kids alone, the point is you were babysitting. If you were calling, something could have been wrong with the children, her children. She should have answered, or if she couldn't answer straight away she should have called straight back.  Since the woman was sitting there for 2hrs before her husband came back, that is a long time that your sister ignored or went unaware of your attempts to contact her.\n\nWhat I would question, though, is whilst making sure the neighbour had a seat and offering her food/drink, did you offer to call her husband to let him know you were locked out or check she was warm enough, since you say it was cold out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for typos & clarity.", "NTA.  You were put in an impossible situation - you didn\u2019t know the neighbor, so how were you to know this wasn\u2019t a scam to get inside the house?  You did everything you reasonably could for her in the circumstances.  \n\nAlso, your sister is an asshole for not picking up her phone while her kids are with a babysitter, especially a new one.  You were calling her about an emergency - not a kid emergency, but still an emergency.  At no time in those two hours did she look at her phone and see the missed calls?  Did your parents not either?  If I were you I would not babysit for her again.", "NTA\n\nThieves use many tactics to get in.  You were entrusted with children.  Just because this woman happened to be a neighbor, you still did the right thing as you don\u2019t know who your sister\u2019s neighbors are.\n\nIt does bother me that your sister was unreachable and left her kids with you.  That was an ah move because what if there been an emergency with one of the kids?", "NTA.\n\nSo I'm autistic myself, so maybe my view is skewed.\n\nBut it seems to me that you went out of your way to accommodate everyone as well as you possibly could while adhering to your written instructions.\n\nIt shows responsibility, problem-solving behaviour, a cool head and a kind heart.\n\nYou did your very best with the tools and rules you were given.\n\nThis:\"when she told me not to allow strangers in she didn\u2019t think that she needed to tell me her 7 month pregnant neighbor in distress was an exception to the rule.\"\n\n... doesn't fly.\n\n\"I'm giving you specific instructions, in which I am completely 100% black-and-white, but then I'm going to berate you for not realising there are shades of grey\"?  Yeah, no, doesn't fly.\n\nHow were you to know that this woman was her neighbour?\n\nYou did exactly right and I wouldn't babysit for sister again until she apologises to you.", "NTA. This woman was a stranger to you, and your sister didn't answer her phone. Your sister should have had her phone on and ready for a call in case something happened to you or the kids. Too many people have had a decoy woman come to the door lately only to have people barge in and rob you, so I don't blame you at all. It would be very unfortunate and I'd feel horrible for leaving someone out in the rain, but I don't trust anyone now.", "Definitely NTA,\n\n how would you know that she was actually a neighbor? You did not know her, she was a stranger and your sister already made it very clear that she was concerned about having strangers in. Which I assumed meant there were some scammers knocking on doors in the area.\n\nNTA, and rude of her to not respond for 2 hours and then complain. \nI mean what if it was an emergency? What if something really dangerous happened?\nShe is the AH", "Oh dear Lord nta at all your family were the only idiots in this scenario and how exactly did anyone in your family expect you to know your sisters neighbors. Also they left their kids with you and what if an accident had happened with them being total complete morons not answering their phones they are the only jerks here period", "NTA - followed instructions as the FIRST TIME babysitter.  Your sister is the a-hole for not answering the phone.  My wife would call home at least one time during ANY baby sitting to make sure the kids were behaving - and it if was the FIRST TIME baby sitter, she might call twice.  Your sister is the problem here.  Emphasis added for the people who forget to READ.", "NTA. Just very literal and classic ASD. I think a pregnant lady in distress would have been an exception but what can you do? ASD- it is what it is. Maybe ask your sister not to put you into such a pressured situation again.Not fair on you especially as you were pretty much forced into doing it.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were told. She was a stranger to you. You had no way of knowing she was actually a neighbor", "NTA\n\n If you did anything wrong, it was going outside at all. For all you knew, the pregnancy was a pillow, and there was a man with a weapon just out of sight,  ready to rush you when the door opened.", "I mean was it unkind to leave a distressed pregnant lady outside? Yes. Would I have let her in and kept and eye on her? Yes. However, you had no way of knowing if she was a neighbor, and you followed your sisters instructions to the letter. You even tried to call her to ask permission and verify and get guidance from your parents. The fact you were baby sitting and you tried to reach the child\u2019s parent multiple times to no avail is really concerning, what if those kids has been in an accident? NTA.", "NTA, as others already stated you did exactly as you were told. I'm not autistic but I did pretty much the same - minus pregnancy - when I was a live in nanny and the family was away one night. A neighbor came to the door to ask for help. I did not know him and had no way to confirm if he was telling the truth so I didn't even open the door, just told him that I'm not allowed to let him in and please seek help at another house. Later I learned that he was indeed a neighbor with no ill intentions but I was not prepared to take a risk in that situation. \nI also don't understand why you and that house were the ONLY option for that lady. No other neighbors? Or no phone number she could've given you to call for her? \nBut of course the real aholes here are your sister and her partner. If anyone else is watching someone's children they absolutely need to be reachable at all times. What if there was an emergency with the children? If your parents knew where you were they are also aholes for not picking up. \nDon't blame yourself, you acted in a very responsible manner, and even tried to help that lady as much as you could without compromising the safety of the children in your care. And please never, ever do any favours to your sister again. Don't let her put you in such a situation again.", "NTA. This sounds exactly like something I would do. I'm also autistic and when I get instructions I follow them to a T. Even in situations like this where many people might have thought \"well, of course this is an exception to the instructions I was given because...\"\n\nI also don't realize until later that oh, yeah, I guess I could have tried x or y. You did your best, and I think it's unfair that people are now upset with you.", "NTA !\n\nOh, I'm so sorry. You're not an AH, you meant well and were conflicted. You didn't know her, maybe you could've asked the kids to verify but you were worried about your own family above all else and that's something I don't think anyone should call yoy names for. Your sister didn't want someone you knew there so I see why a total stranger sure wouldn't make sense.\n\nBy the sounds of it you offered all you could think of to make her comfortable and be as hospitable as possible given the circumstance.", "NTA. \n\nHow were you supposed to KNOW that was really their neighbor, you had never met her before?\n\nPlus what kind of parents are unreachable all night when someone is watching their children, especially someone new for the first time? This was an emergency. Next time it could have been an emergency involving the children. \n\nThey and your parents need to back off.", "NTA.  The proper response would have been to call the police.  It's not unusual for crooks to use decoys.  Let's say a group of criminals is planning a home invasion.  But they don't want to break the door in, they want to trick you into opening the door.  So how do they do that?  \n\n1)  Five big, tall men wearing ski masks knock on the door and ask you politely to let them in.  OR\n\n2)  Five big, tall men hide in bushes or around the corner of the building while pregnant lady knocks on door and asks you for help.  As soon as you open the door, the group of thugs rush in and rape you and kill you.\n\nYou did right in trying to call to verify the identity of the girl who knocked on the door.  But as you couldn't verify who she was, the proper thing to do would have been to call the police.  She could have been a decoy for a gang of thugs, or she could have been a human being in genuine distress.  Either way, it would have been appropriate for the police to sort out the situation.\n\nYou didn't do everything right.  But you were not wrong for not letting her in.", "NTA.  You did the best you could in a situation where you were unable to communicate with your sister.  You followed her rules.  Had she answered you, you would most certainly have let her in.  I wonder why she didn't try another neighbor's house...   Again, you did the best you could in a sucky situation and you followed your sister's rules!", "NTA, you still accommodated her by providing a chair and offering food and water while also respecting your sisters wishes", "NTA. You are the smartest person in this story. They're gaslighting you.  \nAs a matter of fact I am annoyed by your story because it is something my older sister would do some silly shit like this, and she is in her 40s. I'm 33, your sister is 30 as a 30 something the fact that she fails to be mindful of the phone calls she receives from you KNOWING you are watching her kids is negligent. You are doing her a favour. Watching her kids is not an entitlement, she has horrible phone etiquette when it comes to parenting. I don't even have kids but if I saw multiple missed calls from someone watching my kids, I am going to be concerned. She could have set her phone on vibrate.Your parents are also enabling your sisters lackadaisical behaviour. So this is what you do, because you are 19 and an adult. Make it very clear to the entire family that you will NO LONGER be available to watch her children for free if this is how you are going to be treated, and then walk out the room. What happened is circumstantial, and I know you feel bad for the pregnant woman, I would too. If you ever see her again, you can apologise and explain this was your sisters mis-hap you were told to not let anyone you didn't know inside the house, and your sister didn't tell you that she was her neighbour.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In a perfect world your sister could have let you know who the neighbors are.
