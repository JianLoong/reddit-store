I was basically left to decide on my own. \n\nI brought out a chair to the porch and told her she can sit there and wait for her husband if she\u2019d like I also offered her some water and food but she politely declined and decided to wait outside her house. She proceeded to wait 2 hours til her husband came back and I saw her crying at some point. \n\nI felt soooo bad but I felt like my hands are tied I tried calling my sister and parents many many time but no one picked up. \n\nWhen my sister came home later that night, I told her what happened and she lashed out on me calling me an idiot and saying when she told me not to allow strangers in she didn\u2019t think that she needed to tell me her 7 month pregnant neighbor in distress was an exception to the rule. \n\nMy parents also later reprimanded me on taking everything so literally and being an idiot. \n\nAITA ?\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\n since everyone is asking why she didn\u2019t go to another neighbor, while I\u2019m not sure why exactly, I\u2019m gonna explain the layout of the houses in my sister\u2019s neighborhood a bit, so basically there are 3 houses that are close to each other: my sister\u2019s, the pregnant woman\u2019s, and another house. \n\nThere are more houses down the road but they are kinda far behind ( within walking distance but she wouldn\u2019t be able to see her husband pull up from there I think maybe that\u2019s why\u2026 I don\u2019t know)\n\nI don\u2019t know, but it is possible that she went to the other house near us and got turned down there before she came to me.

She did what was asked of her. I'm also autistic and I'd probably do the same thing in your shoes. So maybe I'm not the best of judge in his situation.", "Okay first of all who tf doesnt answer the calls from the person watching their children?? Thats disturbing yikes. \n\nYoure not an idiot for following rules given to you about someone else home. Thats insane. \n\nNever babysit for your sister again. \n\nNTA", "Honestly NTA because you were following instructions. You had no way of knowing who this woman was or if she was telling the truth", "NTA\n\nUnless it was freezing cold, or super hot, giving her a chair and offering water so she can wait outside is all you needed to do for the neighbor. \n\nYour sister absolutely should have answered her phone, though, while you were watching her kids. That's not ok -- I would not watch her kids again.", ">she didn\u2019t think that she needed to tell me her 7 month pregnant neighbor in distress was an exception to the rule. \n\nUh, actually yeah she did need to specify that? She told you no strangers, and she was a stranger to you. How would you know if she was actually the neighbor, you don't live here.\n\nLet's be honest, if something happened to the kids because of her she would have blamed you for letting her inside, pregnant and distressed or not. NTA. \n\nHowever, couldn't you ask the kids if they recognized her? You haven't specified their age or if they are verbal so I'm just asking", "NTA. You were trusted with your sisters children and took precaution to ensure their safety. Tough circumstance, but you did the right thing", "I don\u2019t care if you are autistic or not. You absolutely did the right thing. Your sister is TA for not letting you have a friend over, since you were doing her a favor and she is presumably not paying you. If she\u2019s paying you, then I retract that part of it. \n\nShe\u2019s also TA for lashing out at you when she was very clear in the instructions. And yes, with all types of crime going on today, it is quite possible that this could have been a ruse to get inside your house and do, who knows what?  I think you did quite well, considering everything.  I wonder whom your sister is going to get to babysit in the future.", "NTA. You did your best to make her comfortable, tried calling your sister to confirm she was who she said she was, and you kept the kids safe. This is exactly what you were supposed to do. You had no way of knowing who she was, so you did the right thing by not letting her in. I am pregnant and I would have definitely understood in that situation. I might have been upset at the situation ( it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to make me cry these days ) but I certainly wouldn\u2019t have blamed you. I also would have been grateful for your help in offering a chair, food, and water. Your really did the right thing and handled a tough situation well. I am sorry that your sister and your parents reacted the way they did, that was not fair.", "NTA, & your sister & parents are absolutely wrong to attack you over this. They *know* you're very literal-minded! If there were to be any exceptions, that should have been made plain up front. No people in her house means no people in her house, & within the limitations of that hard rule you did what you could to be helpful.", "Nta....i agree with all the comments....parents regardless of date night or not need to be available to the one person who has their kids.", "As a father of 4 children with autism: you're NTA.\n\nAlthough I understand your sister and parents complaint to not take everything so literally. I can headbutt myself about that on many occasion. But it's just the way your brain works. \n\nYou didn't know the neighbour, you had clear orders about strangers. You even tried to inform your sister and parents which is very good. You were willing to help. Chances could be she was a crook, and then what would your sister say?", "NTA - you did what you were told to do and kept the safety of those children the priority. The situation about the woman\u2019s keys inside her home is unfortunate but not your responsibility to fix. \nAlso, TA is your sister for not picking up the phone after multiple calls! If something had happened with with kids she would\u2019ve been unreachable. What parent doesn\u2019t answer the phone when their babysitter calls!?! Idc if it\u2019s date night, those are your kids and that\u2019s your home and are always a priority.", "NTA. You did what you were told, and even offered her a chair + food & water. Why she didn\u2019t try another neighbour is beyond me.", "NTA - I do not know if its the same where you live, but here - its common for women, mothers, older women, pregnant ladies to come and knock and ask for help with something inconsequential and later commit crimes - mostly robbery. You did right by not opening up the door, if something had happened to the kids - they would have undoubtedly blamed you. \n\nI would have assumed your family members to understand this honestly - maybe think twice before babysitting your sister's kids again.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t know her, and you weren\u2019t comfortable letting her into the home and your sister didn\u2019t answer the phone.\n\nWhat strikes me as odd is why didn\u2019t she seek help from any other neighbors.", "NTA. You did what she told you to do. It sounds like your parents and sister don\u2019t understand autism otherwise they would know you take things literally and have a very difficult time recognizing exceptions to rules. And it was irresponsible of your sister to not answer your phone calls. She could have prevented the situation if she had answered or called you back quickly.", "NTA. You are not an idiot, you did your best and your sister should have answered her phone when her babysitter was calling.", "NTA. You did not know if this woman was lying and how on earth did your sister ignore your calls the first time you babysit for her?  She is the AH here.", "NTA. You did what you were told. You aren\u2019t a mind reader.", "NTA. Call 911 next time.", "NTA\n\nIt's her neighboor not yours... to you is just a stranger.\n\nDon't ever babysit for that ungratefull b ever again\n\nAnd you could basically call CPS since your sister left her baby with someone with no expertise on how take care of a baby.", "NTA. Your sister gave you some hard rules and didn\u2019t give you discretionary leeway. You tried to get guidance from your sister and parents, but neither were available. \n\nYou did the best you could, offering some assistance, and your family is lashing out at you because they\u2019re mostly upset with themselves, both for not answering and for not considering your literal nature when giving such strict guidelines to prevent you from having friends over. \n\nSince this was the first time you\u2019ve done this, they should\u2019ve planned to be available at least by phone. They should always have an emergency contact available when someone else watches their kids.", "Definitely NTA. If your sister had answered and could have proven it was actually her neighbor, it would have been fine to let her in, but you didn't know this woman. Not everyone is who they say they are.\n\nAnd honestly, your sister is a giant AH for not answering the phone the entire night! What if it had been an emergency with her child? And your parents didn't answer either? What's wrong with your family?", "NTA. People have used this as a scam to get into people\u2019s houses before. You did what you were told. Your sister wasn\u2019t available when you called, which someone needs to be if you\u2019re watching their children. You don\u2019t know her neighbours and can\u2019t be expected to make accommodations for people you don\u2019t know - strangers. Not your fault, you did your job.", "NTA   \nAutistic or not the rule was very clear, \"No strangers in the house\" is everybody that you don\u00b4t know.   \nI would have definitely done the same, how are you supposed to know your sisters neighbours?? Or that this wasn\u00b4t a very common scam? They are completely out of line to treat you like that.", "NTA\n\nThis is a common tactic used by thieves. You use a pregnant woman, because who wouldn\u2019t want to help a pregnant woman. You did the right thing. The only thing you may have done, is ask her a question only she would know to verify that she was telling the truth. Other than that you acted responsibly.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, your sister had clearly stated that under no circumstances were you to allow strangers into her home.\n\nOkay, so the lady was a next door neighbour - at least she claimed to be. Since you say she told you she was the next door neighbour, I get the impression that you didn't recognise her. So unless she showed you her ID and proved her address, you only had her word that she was the neighbour, not a thief with a good story trying to get in the house.  And even if she showed you the ID to prove she was a neighbour, this wouldn't automatically prove she was known to your sister and your sister would welcome her coming into the house.\n\nSecondly, your sister did not pick up your calls.\n\nYou were babysitting your sister's kids for the first time alone. Imo, it didn't matter whether this was the 1st or the 101st time you were babysitting the kids alone, the point is you were babysitting. If you were calling, something could have been wrong with the children, her children. She should have answered, or if she couldn't answer straight away she should have called straight back.  Since the woman was sitting there for 2hrs before her husband came back, that is a long time that your sister ignored or went unaware of your attempts to contact her.\n\nWhat I would question, though, is whilst making sure the neighbour had a seat and offering her food/drink, did you offer to call her husband to let him know you were locked out or check she was warm enough, since you say it was cold out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for typos & clarity.", "NTA.  You were put in an impossible situation - you didn\u2019t know the neighbor, so how were you to know this wasn\u2019t a scam to get inside the house?  You did everything you reasonably could for her in the circumstances.  \n\nAlso, your sister is an asshole for not picking up her phone while her kids are with a babysitter, especially a new one.  You were calling her about an emergency - not a kid emergency, but still an emergency.  At no time in those two hours did she look at her phone and see the missed calls?  Did your parents not either?  If I were you I would not babysit for her again.", "NTA\n\nThieves use many tactics to get in.  You were entrusted with children.  Just because this woman happened to be a neighbor, you still did the right thing as you don\u2019t know who your sister\u2019s neighbors are.\n\nIt does bother me that your sister was unreachable and left her kids with you.  That was an ah move because what if there been an emergency with one of the kids?", "NTA.\n\nSo I'm autistic myself, so maybe my view is skewed.\n\nBut it seems to me that you went out of your way to accommodate everyone as well as you possibly could while adhering to your written instructions.\n\nIt shows responsibility, problem-solving behaviour, a cool head and a kind heart.\n\nYou did your very best with the tools and rules you were given.\n\nThis:\"when she told me not to allow strangers in she didn\u2019t think that she needed to tell me her 7 month pregnant neighbor in distress was an exception to the rule.\"\n\n... doesn't fly.\n\n\"I'm giving you specific instructions, in which I am completely 100% black-and-white, but then I'm going to berate you for not realising there are shades of grey\"?  Yeah, no, doesn't fly.\n\nHow were you to know that this woman was her neighbour?\n\nYou did exactly right and I wouldn't babysit for sister again until she apologises to you.", "NTA. This woman was a stranger to you, and your sister didn't answer her phone. Your sister should have had her phone on and ready for a call in case something happened to you or the kids. Too many people have had a decoy woman come to the door lately only to have people barge in and rob you, so I don't blame you at all. It would be very unfortunate and I'd feel horrible for leaving someone out in the rain, but I don't trust anyone now.", "Definitely NTA,\n\n how would you know that she was actually a neighbor? You did not know her, she was a stranger and your sister already made it very clear that she was concerned about having strangers in. Which I assumed meant there were some scammers knocking on doors in the area.\n\nNTA, and rude of her to not respond for 2 hours and then complain. \nI mean what if it was an emergency? What if something really dangerous happened?\nShe is the AH", "Oh dear Lord nta at all your family were the only idiots in this scenario and how exactly did anyone in your family expect you to know your sisters neighbors. Also they left their kids with you and what if an accident had happened with them being total complete morons not answering their phones they are the only jerks here period", "NTA - followed instructions as the FIRST TIME babysitter.  Your sister is the a-hole for not answering the phone.  My wife would call home at least one time during ANY baby sitting to make sure the kids were behaving - and it if was the FIRST TIME baby sitter, she might call twice.  Your sister is the problem here.  Emphasis added for the people who forget to READ.", "NTA. Just very literal and classic ASD. I think a pregnant lady in distress would have been an exception but what can you do? ASD- it is what it is. Maybe ask your sister not to put you into such a pressured situation again.Not fair on you especially as you were pretty much forced into doing it.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were told. She was a stranger to you. You had no way of knowing she was actually a neighbor", "NTA\n\n If you did anything wrong, it was going outside at all. For all you knew, the pregnancy was a pillow, and there was a man with a weapon just out of sight,  ready to rush you when the door opened.", "I mean was it unkind to leave a distressed pregnant lady outside? Yes. Would I have let her in and kept and eye on her? Yes. However, you had no way of knowing if she was a neighbor, and you followed your sisters instructions to the letter. You even tried to call her to ask permission and verify and get guidance from your parents. The fact you were baby sitting and you tried to reach the child\u2019s parent multiple times to no avail is really concerning, what if those kids has been in an accident? NTA.", "NTA, as others already stated you did exactly as you were told. I'm not autistic but I did pretty much the same - minus pregnancy - when I was a live in nanny and the family was away one night. A neighbor came to the door to ask for help. I did not know him and had no way to confirm if he was telling the truth so I didn't even open the door, just told him that I'm not allowed to let him in and please seek help at another house. Later I learned that he was indeed a neighbor with no ill intentions but I was not prepared to take a risk in that situation. \nI also don't understand why you and that house were the ONLY option for that lady. No other neighbors? Or no phone number she could've given you to call for her? \nBut of course the real aholes here are your sister and her partner. If anyone else is watching someone's children they absolutely need to be reachable at all times. What if there was an emergency with the children? If your parents knew where you were they are also aholes for not picking up. \nDon't blame yourself, you acted in a very responsible manner, and even tried to help that lady as much as you could without compromising the safety of the children in your care. And please never, ever do any favours to your sister again. Don't let her put you in such a situation again.", "NTA. This sounds exactly like something I would do. I'm also autistic and when I get instructions I follow them to a T. Even in situations like this where many people might have thought \"well, of course this is an exception to the instructions I was given because...\"\n\nI also don't realize until later that oh, yeah, I guess I could have tried x or y. You did your best, and I think it's unfair that people are now upset with you.", "NTA !\n\nOh, I'm so sorry. You're not an AH, you meant well and were conflicted. You didn't know her, maybe you could've asked the kids to verify but you were worried about your own family above all else and that's something I don't think anyone should call yoy names for. Your sister didn't want someone you knew there so I see why a total stranger sure wouldn't make sense.\n\nBy the sounds of it you offered all you could think of to make her comfortable and be as hospitable as possible given the circumstance.", "NTA. \n\nHow were you supposed to KNOW that was really their neighbor, you had never met her before?\n\nPlus what kind of parents are unreachable all night when someone is watching their children, especially someone new for the first time? This was an emergency. Next time it could have been an emergency involving the children. \n\nThey and your parents need to back off.", "NTA.  The proper response would have been to call the police.  It's not unusual for crooks to use decoys.  Let's say a group of criminals is planning a home invasion.  But they don't want to break the door in, they want to trick you into opening the door.  So how do they do that?  \n\n1)  Five big, tall men wearing ski masks knock on the door and ask you politely to let them in.  OR\n\n2)  Five big, tall men hide in bushes or around the corner of the building while pregnant lady knocks on door and asks you for help.  As soon as you open the door, the group of thugs rush in and rape you and kill you.\n\nYou did right in trying to call to verify the identity of the girl who knocked on the door.  But as you couldn't verify who she was, the proper thing to do would have been to call the police.  She could have been a decoy for a gang of thugs, or she could have been a human being in genuine distress.  Either way, it would have been appropriate for the police to sort out the situation.\n\nYou didn't do everything right.  But you were not wrong for not letting her in.", "NTA.  You did the best you could in a situation where you were unable to communicate with your sister.  You followed her rules.  Had she answered you, you would most certainly have let her in.  I wonder why she didn't try another neighbor's house...   Again, you did the best you could in a sucky situation and you followed your sister's rules!", "NTA, you still accommodated her by providing a chair and offering food and water while also respecting your sisters wishes", "NTA. You are the smartest person in this story. They're gaslighting you.  \nAs a matter of fact I am annoyed by your story because it is something my older sister would do some silly shit like this, and she is in her 40s. I'm 33, your sister is 30 as a 30 something the fact that she fails to be mindful of the phone calls she receives from you KNOWING you are watching her kids is negligent. You are doing her a favour. Watching her kids is not an entitlement, she has horrible phone etiquette when it comes to parenting. I don't even have kids but if I saw multiple missed calls from someone watching my kids, I am going to be concerned. She could have set her phone on vibrate.Your parents are also enabling your sisters lackadaisical behaviour. So this is what you do, because you are 19 and an adult. Make it very clear to the entire family that you will NO LONGER be available to watch her children for free if this is how you are going to be treated, and then walk out the room. What happened is circumstantial, and I know you feel bad for the pregnant woman, I would too. If you ever see her again, you can apologise and explain this was your sisters mis-hap you were told to not let anyone you didn't know inside the house, and your sister didn't tell you that she was her neighbour.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They told us not to answer the door to people of the parents didn\u2019t give us a heads up that they were coming. Or that even when someone calls claiming to be the grandmother, don\u2019t say that you\u2019re alone with the kids b/c it could be a complicated family situation.\n\nThere are actual crimes that are committed with decoys like this. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a thing. \n\nAlso, your sister should\u2019ve been checking her phone. What if there was an emergency? They\u2019re being irresponsible and blaming you for it.", "NTA how were you supposed to know?", "NTA, as you were given explicit instructions and had no way of knowing if the woman was a neighbor or the leading edge of a home invasion. In a perfect world your sister could have let you know who the neighbors are. Given your orders and the information you had at the time your response was reasonable.\n\nFor future reference though, the best response to a heavily pregnant woman claiming to be in medical distress is probably \"call an ambulance.\" She can always refuse treatment when they arrive.", "Ur parents and and sister are so mean tf and no hun ur NTA", "NTA you played it safe", "NTA  with you receiving the slightest touch of blame for agreeing to babysit.

Asking the older child if the person was a stranger would be the next logical step.  \n\nIf you are so literal that you are unable to function in emergencies, you really shouldn\u2019t be watching children and your family should already know this about you.  Autism makes social norms harder.  At 19, you should be seeking out the therapy required to learn them when they don\u2019t come intuitively.

Because to us communication is **explicit**. It has to be. There\u2019s pretty much *always* a reason for how we phrase things. You say what you mean and you mean what you say. Simple.\n\nBut most neurotypical communication is **implicit**. It\u2019s laden with hidden social cues and very much *not* saying what you mean. It assumes the receiver of the info will understand hidden meaning and unspecified social rules. Very much not simple to us bc we (autistics) don\u2019t do that! Nothing is implied for us and we tend to follow rules strictly.\n\nYour sister specifically said \u201cUnder no circumstances are you to let strangers in my house.\u201d ***Under no circumstances.***\n\nSo, fine.

But you also wanna keep your niblings safe because yeah, she could be lying -- and idk about you, but I know that I (and many other autistic people) have a really hard time deciphering if someone might be lying. You don't know her, and your sister said \"no strangers in the house under any circumstances.\" She didn\u2019t say \u201cuse your best judgement!\" But, like... it\u2019s a pregnant person in the cold!

Neither do your parents.\n\nNow, it\u2019s like \u201cFuck, what do I do?!\u201d because\u2026 ***what the fuck are you supposed to do???***\n\nSo you fall back on the only thing you know to be true: your sister doesn\u2019t want you to let strangers into her house under any circumstances... *and that\u2019s precisely what you do.* If your sister and parents have such an issue with how you handled this situation, they should\u2019ve *picked up their damn phones.* They should\u2019ve been more **explicit**, more **specific**.

Your family are all assholes and I hope they've lost the benefit of your babysitting services for the foreseeable future, because they don't deserve them and have proven that they won't respond when a serious (hospital or police-worthy) emergency occurs. That's an unsafe, unfair, and inappropriate situation for them to put you in and I strongly recommend not allowing them another opportunity.\n\nLike, you don't even need to throw your diagnosis on top of this for them to be massively, *stunningly* in the wrong, they already were. That they haven't grasped the intricacies of your diagnosis, your needs and the accommodations that would make your life easier as well as limit situations like this one after nineteen. years. of. knowing. you. is a failing on their part, alone, and at this point just another dollop of bullshit in the bowl.\n\nGod, OP, I'm sorry. Shrug it off, if you can and if you can't then I'd focus on your own life instead. You can't fix stupid, right?", "NTA you followed your sister\u2019s rules. You also tried calling her and your sister was extremely irresponsible to not pick up her phone when you called repeatedly. This was a urgent call, but what if it had been a serious emergency? Your sister purposely ignored the babysitter\u2019s repeated calls. That\u2019s solely on her. \n\nAnd, also, you have autism. Part of the condition causes you to be very serious and also very literal to what you\u2019re told to do. You\u2019re absolutely not an idiot and you\u2019re in the right to follow orders. \n\nWhile it\u2019s unfortunate for your neighbor, she could have called a locksmith to come open her door. If she had her own vehicle she She could have sat in that in the warmth. If not, she could have called a rude service to take her to a public location that would allow her to sit and wait on her husband. She herself could have tried calling your sister. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault at all. Especially in this day and age where there\u2019s a lot of criminal people using this sort of a scenario to prey on sympathetic unsuspecting people. They open the doors for the distressed pregnant woman and then they\u2019re ambushed by other\u2019s hiding and then their robbed or worse. So, no you weren\u2019t wrong to do what you did. \n\nI\u2019d NEVER babysit for your sister again though after she behaved not only so irresponsibly by not answering repeated phone calls, but also so verbally and emotionally abusive.", "NTA!\nYou were already uncomfortable as this was your first time watching the kids by yourself. Also your sister specifically told you to not let anyone in, and then proceeded to not answer her phone. You did exactly what she told you to. I\u2019m so sorry this happened and that you are being treated so unkindly! You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I would definitely not babysit for your sister ever again though!", "NTA. Your family sucks, you did everything right", "NTA I would do the exact same thing.", "NTA, I would have done the same, and I am not autistic, it's not your home, and you are following her rules, but she is the asshole for not answering the phone, and quite irresponsible and also your parents", "NTA.

It is unlikely she got pregnant in order to conduct criminal activity and as long she does not seem erratic or violent I would let her in.\n\nOn the other hand, the only way I can excuse your sister's behavior is if she was unaware that you are  autistic or has no idea what that means. Of course you reacted that way to a 'rule' that was poorly explained. It's not what most people would do but if you are actually autistic of course its what you did.\n\nTell your parents and sister that they really should read a little about autism if they would like to understand you better. Calling a neuro-divergent person an idiot for what is very clearly natural to them is ignorant and prejudiced.\n\nYour brain is very literal and they should know that and keep it in mind when communicating with you.", "NTA \n\nYou did exactly what she said in not letting strangers in the house, therefore keeping you and her kids safe. \n\nThe stranger may of been pregnant but doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a dangerous person.", "NTA - You followed your sister's explicit instructions. If she's going to get mad at you for that, it's probably better not to babysit for her any longer.", "NTA - sad but you ultimately did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nBut there's a much bigger problem here: your sister refused to answer her phone. That meant that you would not have been able to contact her (or your parents) if there had been an emergency involving the children. \n\nRefuse to babysit for her again if she is going to turn off her phone.\n\nShe is at fault here, not you.", "NTA. You did the best you could do in your situation, plus you offered the woman a chair at least. I also agree with everyone else, your sister should have been able to answer the phone and I wouldn\u2019t not babysit again for her unless she 100% understands that she needs to answer when you call because it could be an emergency.", "NTA. That lady is a stranger to you. She said no strangers.", "NTA. You were uncomfortable babysitting alone, but your sister wouldn\u2019t answer any phone calls? What kind of idiot leaves their children with someone uncomfortable with being alone babysitting for the first time and doesn\u2019t answer a phone call, or several? The issue wasn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t know if you would be allowed to let someone in, you were SPECIFICALLY told NOT to let strangers in. So you didn\u2019t. They know that you are autistic and can tend to take things literally. How can anyone be legitimately angry with you? They are projecting their guilt for not being there for you when you needed help with babysitting. They know the situation is all their fault and are blaming you. You did the right thing and they failed you as well as the neighbor. \n\nI have 2 pieces of advice: First, do not babysit again. Your sister showed you that she won\u2019t remain reachable in case of emergency. And second, stop by that pregnant neighbor\u2019s house with a small baby gift or something nice for her and explain to her what happened. Open with an apology and explain away.

Even pregnant. Wtf? They should enjoy finding other help or staying home from now on. (Mom is AH also)", "You didn't do anything wrong. You followed her strict instructions, she absolutely should have been paying attention to her phone in case of an emergency. Plus, even though it's really sad (and turned out to not be the case), there have been cases of people preying on people's sympathy by using a seemingly pregnant woman, woman with a baby etc, as a way to gain access to someone's home/car for sinister reasons.  I don't blame you for being cautious", "NTA. That woman was a stranger to you. Under the circumstances, I don't think I would've let her in either.", "Nta also make it clear to your sister you don\u2019t appreciate her calling you names.

It could have been bad either way.\n\nYou did the right thing. The pregnant lady called her husband. Why didn\u2019t she call anyone else, or sit in her own warm car and wait?

Your parents and sister should understand you were trying to keep the kids safe and appreciate that. That being said, it might go a long ways towards calming everybody down if you offer to apologize to the neighbor and tell her you\u2019re sorry but you didn\u2019t know her snd were just trying to be safe but now that you know her and know your sister would be okay with it it won\u2019t happen again.", "She said no strangers, so you did no strangers.

Leaving a nauseous person on a porch in cold weather is a health risk especially for a pregnant person.", ">  I didn\u2019t think about a lot of options I had at the time\u2026 it\u2019s so weird when you\u2019re in the spot you can\u2019t think clearly.\n\nPeople live most of their lives on autopilot.  Get up, eat breakfast, go to work/school, go home, watch tv, etc.  Our lives are mostly scripted without even thinking about it.  When there is a new situation, one for which we do not have a 'script,' autopilot gets switched off and we have to start actively thinking about what to do and that's hard.\n\nOne thing you can go do is plan for possibilities.   Plans don't last very long when they collide with reality, but the real benefit of planning is learning how to think things through.  So even if you don't have a plan for whatever happens, you still have practice thinking through what to do.", "cops can let her in the house\n\ncops can call emts if she is in distress.\n\nIf someone needs help 911 is a good option.\n\nespecially if you are scared that the person is bad.", "Presumably if she was that ill she would have asked for an ambulance or something,  not sat in the porch for hours.  But yes,  also risky for her.  Surely she knew someone else nearby.", "This is Reddit, not America.", "Not everyone on reddit is from the United States, other countries exist.", "the fact that you didn't know this about 3 year olds and you expressed your nervousness about this being your first time alone with the kids is something your sister knew. she DID NOT ANSWER HER PHONE the entire time you were babysitting despite knowing this about you.

Imagine if she\u2019d just believed that woman and it turned out she was there to rob them wearing a fake belly to gain entry. OP was told not to let any strangers in under any circumstances.

You had no way of knowing that she really was your sister's neighbour. I'm just sorry that your sister and parents let you down by not being available when an unexpected (and potentially emergency) situation happened.", "Honestly, that post just goes to show how fickle and hypocritical people can be. Like they come down like a ton of bricks on someone for being an AH but they all encourage AH petty retaliation.", "I remember seeing that and being surprised at that judgement. It's not like the babysitter invited the mother in to get day drunk, IIRC the mother was dropping something off or whatever. It's also not as if the mother was rude or stole anything or whatever else. Like yeah, it can be uncomfortable for the homeowner, but a one-off \"my mother came by and then we chatted for a bit\" is hardly a problematic scenario.

Sister said no strangers. To OP, the pregnant neighbor is a stranger.", "And she's autistic. She probably likes to stick to the rules set and takes things really literal. This woman was a stranger to OP, she's not allowed to let strangers in (apparently not even her friends, which are no strangers to her but only her sister, so I hate that wording already. Would've confused me a lot!) - so 1+1=2. \n\nThis is completely on the older sister. Pregnant neighbour will manage tho.
