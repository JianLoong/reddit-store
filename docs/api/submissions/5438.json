{"id": 5438, "submission_id": "ztakh2", "title": "AITA for choosing to leave town for Christmas due to my families rules?", "selftext": "I(26M) moved back home with family earlier this year to finish what's left of my school and move back out in the next month or two. Only problem is, my family is very religious and strict. No cooking after 10PM(when my father goes to sleep) because it wakes him up, despite my class schedule being night and therefore I'm up all night. No friends coming over unless its to do wholesome things and even then if he hears them curse he yells and corrects them. If I go out with a friend, or my friend thats drunk needs a place to stay, they say they cant stay here(I know, very christian-like from a religious family). Essentially, textbook control issues.\n\nAnyways, when I first moved back I was allowed to have my longtime girlfriend sleep over if I slept on the couch. My father slowly changed that to complaining if shes here for more than a day or two because if I sleep on the couch it \"disrupts his day\". Now they have officially banned her from staying over - stating if she wants to stay with someone in town, her brother lives close enough by and she can stay there. This led to me essentially saying that I will be out of town with my girlfriend and her family then for the holidays. Since then, my mom has texted me on several occasions telling me that she is \"more disappointed than upset\" with me for being petty and going against my father and \"simple\" house rules. I told her that they enable his control issues by not saying anything due to fear of being lashed out on and if she wants to be upset with someone, look at her husband. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nFor those saying that my dad is reasonable with rules, I\u2019ll add more context. Not only does he do the above, but he blocks adult searches on internet or anything he deems to be adult with the message as \u201cI WILL SEE WHAT YOU SEARCHED\u201d - was even worse when we were younger when he tracked everything we did and not only that but confronted us for what we searched weekly. Just recently he started eavesdropped everyone in the house using the bathroom and confronted someone for not washing their hands long enough in the bathroom, even my girlfriend, a guest. Last month, threatened to tell my cousins they couldn\u2019t stay here once he found out they were visiting to go to a work concert that was \u201crap drug music\u201d , etc.\n\nFor the heating up food, he unplugs the microwave and puts a note on it saying to eat cereal or a sandwich. I can\u2019t heat up water for ramen, microwave food for 1 minute, etc etc. This isn\u2019t me \u201ccooking a full meal\u201d with tons of smells, I can\u2019t use the microwave for a minute because that 30 seconds of aroma \u201cwakes him up\u201d. I can\u2019t even prep healthy food earlier in the day and reheat it for 30 seconds..\n\nAlso, my parents don\u2019t allow me to sleep on the couch, not in the same room - not sure how that relates to having sex.. \n\n\n\nIf that\u2019s what you consider reasonable then I don\u2019t know..", "created_utc": 1671785325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztakh2/aita_for_choosing_to_leave_town_for_christmas_due/", "score": 576, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he knew they were going to roll on the more conservative side of things, you need to keep your powder dry in order to effect some good change.\n\nIf his friends swearing is *this level* of a sticking point, I am betting that his friends are pretty loose with their lips. One of my kids is a sailor, as was I, and somehow we manage to not live an R-rated life when we are together.\n\nOP *may* have some ground to stand on to push for some change, but he is being nitpicky and undermining his own cause.", "Bring a gun to someone's house, without their permission.\n\nSee what happens", "Yeah it's true that he knew his parents were more conservative people.

Why can't you meal prep during the weekend or something?\n\n>if he hears them curse he yells and corrects them.\n\nHe doesn't want vulgar language in his house.  Are your friends toddlers?  Why can't they respect the house rules?\n\n>or my friend thats drunk needs a place to stay, they say they cant stay here\n\nTell you what.  When you own *your* own house, you're more than welcome to let drunk strangers spend the night at your place.  Until then, not letting drunk people into his house to \"sleep it off\" or whatever is a perfectly acceptable boundary to have.  You couldn't even do that with a lot of ROOMMATES - inviting a drunk stranger into a shared space over night.\n\n> Essentially, textbook control issues.\n\nNot really.  It just sounds like you and your dad have incompatible living styles.\n\n>Now they have officially banned her from staying over - stating if she wants to stay with someone in town, her brother lives close enough by and she can stay there. \n\nYou understand that your parents don't have to let your girlfriend stay the night, right?  It's their house.  If they don't want someone they're not related to living there (or even staying the night), they don't have to.\n\n>This led to me essentially saying that I will be out of town with my girlfriend and her family then for the holidays.\n\nAnd that's perfectly fair.\n\n> Since then, my mom has texted me on several occasions telling me that she is \"more disappointed than upset\" with me for being petty and going against my father and \"simple\" house rules.\n\nEh, your mom is kinda being a bit out-of-touch here.  You're 26, and very clearly chafe at the house rules.  Your mom needs to realize that.\n\n>I told her that they enable his control issues by not saying anything due to fear of being lashed out on and if she wants to be upset with someone, look at her husband. \n\nThis is where you crossed the line too.  Just because you weren't able to live with the house rules doesn't mean your mom finds them objectionable.  You diminish her by implying she has no agency in her life.\n\nYou're allowed to not want to stay with your parents.

That would be wayyyyy too much smell. It\u2019s no using the microwave as well- he used to unplug it from the wall. I couldn\u2019t heat up water to make ramen, heat up microwave food for a minute. He puts a post it note on the microwave that says make a sandwich or cereal. This is my late lunch/dinner time with the way my class schedule worked and basically is forcing me to eat like a gremlin. \n\nCan\u2019t even prep my food earlier and microwave because using the microwave for 30 seconds \u201csmells up the house\u201d", "That\u2019s fair - I do want to clarify the no drunk people isn\u2019t really pertaining to people wanting to come over drunk every weekend. It was pertaining to the once ever 3 or 4 months when a friend from out of town that I grew up with needed a place to stay for one night instead of driving. Also, had a girl(that\u2019s a friend) that was domestically abused a few years ago that needed a place to stay for a night and he also turned her down when she came to me for help.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a rarity but when someone needs help he just turns them down.", "This is actually kind of overlooked.

I ask every time she comes over, my parents know. I do cook in advance, he literally unplugs the microwave and leaves a sign on it that says eat cereal or a sandwich.

The rules are unreasonable in the sense that as an adult you should be able to discuss and compromise with your parents. Your dad is a dictator and is fine with everyone suffering as long as things are done his way. As other people pointed out it\u2019s his home but you can also choose how much time you spend there. Hope everyone who\u2019s so adamant about my house my rules on here isn\u2019t surprised when other people don\u2019t want to spend holidays at their houses with overbearing rules.

And thats why I thinks hes wrong, I think he owes it to his parents to at least spend christmas with them when they are the ones doing him a huge favor.", "Oh, forgot to mention in the post. He still blocks internet searches for the whole house for adult searches or anything he deems as nsfw, he has eavesdropped on us in the bathroom to the point where he confronted one of my family members for not washing their hands after using it, used to watch what everyone in the house searched on the internet and confront them, etc etc. \n\nSo, yeah, you decide.", "Well this is when I was still living here full time, and it wasn\u2019t much of offering up, more so me asking my mom who agreed and my dad who said no. But I guess that\u2019s a fair point. It\u2019s really just funny because of how religious they are and their religion always talks about opening your home to those in need.", "I decided. YTA in real life and in this thread. A mooch trying to move your GF into your parents house.", "Yep, OP is trying to move the GF in. He's an AH.", "No. It sounds like the girlfriend lives out-of-town and needs a place to stay when visiting OP. That's why the dad said the brother lives nearby, and why OP has to go out-of-town to spend Christmas with her family", "I\u2019ve had sex in my parents house but I was 20 and they were gone for the weekend so I knew that they wouldn\u2019t be inconvenienced.
