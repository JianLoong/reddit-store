This led to me essentially saying that I will be out of town with my girlfriend and her family then for the holidays. Since then, my mom has texted me on several occasions telling me that she is \"more disappointed than upset\" with me for being petty and going against my father and \"simple\" house rules. I told her that they enable his control issues by not saying anything due to fear of being lashed out on and if she wants to be upset with someone, look at her husband.

You should always spend Christmas with the people you want to spend Christmas with.", "NTA it is natural that you want to be with your girlfriend at Christmas. Letting you stay with them does not allow your parents to make rules about who you see and where you spend your time - those go way beyond 'simple house rules'", "NTA.  \n\nHello friend, I believe your mom dropped her broom. She\u2019s gonna need it with all the rug sweeping she\u2019s doing.", "NTA. Spend christmas with those you feel comfortable", "NTA for wanting your parents to treat you like an adult and stop with the controlling micromanagement.  But seriously, you know who they are.  You're there for a month or two.  Finish the schooling and get out of there.  It's their house, their rules, their controlling nature.  You don't really have the right to impose your desire for more flexibility when you're living there.

Don't be surprised if people find less suffocating living conditions elsewhere.", "NTA. Sounds to me like you're respecting your family's rules. They don't want her there, so you're spending time with her elsewhere.

If yes, you pay rent then there is room for compromise. \n\nNTA for choosing to spend Christmas elsewhere, that's what happens when people grow up. \n\nAs to how you handled it, seems ESH. You could have been better with your Mom.

But my father wouldn't have allowed cooking after 10pm or random 20-somethings staying over either, and I don't think he's a control freak.

Same with not wanting other random adults in their home.  The fact you cannot understand this shows you are still very immature.  You completely ditching family Christmas is an A-hole move in response.  \n\nYou mentioning religion when in fact none of their rules seem to involve religion is also an A-hole move designed to get others onto your side because for many religion = bad.", "ESH. A lot of their rules seem reasonable. They don't want drunk people over. They don't like cursing in the house (warn your friends). They don't like your girlfriend staying over too many nights.\n\nThe cooking thing is unfortunate but I guess you can cook ahead of time. Idk you're in their house and I'm assuming you're not paying rent. Most of it isn't too crazy.", "YTA\n\nNot wanting someone to cook after 10p is reasonable.  Not wanting someone to sleep in the living room for days on end is reasonable.

You are a 26 year old man. That is 1/3 of the way through a military retirement. That is a year past typical law school.  And you go home, what sounds like rent free, and you want to carry on like a kid. \"Friends over that curse\" etc etc. These folks are doing you a favor. They owe you nothing. And you criticize them.

You're not an AH for not wanting to stay for the holidays, but I don't see where your dad is being overly controlling or unreasonable. Not cooking food after 10pm when the owners of the house follow a daytime schedule and your cooking would wake your dad up (when he's in his bedroom) is a reasonable rule. Your dad having expectations for the behaviors people have in his home is reasonable, and it is your responsibility to inform your guests of those expectations. Not wanting adults they don't know sleeping over, especially drunk adults they don't know, is reasonable. If you're awake at night and sleeping during the day, it's reasonable for your parents to get frustrated that you are essentially hogging up the common area for days at a time when your girlfriend is over. \n\nYour parents aren't being unreasonable, you're just an adult with your own life and wants and expectations and now that you've moved out for a bit and grown away from your parents living with them and their rules feels constricting.

By doing nothing and saying nothing, it's got to the point where my freedom has shrunk more and more.\n\nI've come to the realization that at a certain point, it's like talking to a slightly more reasonable talking head of him.", "But he is not.

You've done all you can then and if she has wholly bought in, even knowing you support her leaving, then nothing will change. \n\nI know it's convenient to stay for a month or two, but hopefully you could leave earlier. Supporting from a distance might be easier on you and allow you to live your life.", ">even knowing you support her leaving, then nothing will change.\n\nYeah, unfortunately have learned that over time.\n\nAlso, been trying to leave after this most recent issue but probably going to be stuck for another month or two regardless,  thanks for your comment though.
