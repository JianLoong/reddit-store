He now works a cleaning job for two hours a night that pays him enough to, in his words, \"barely get by.\"\n\nHis sister (49F) recently moved back from being overseas and is currently living with him. She is unemployed as well and also does not want to work. My bf pays for everything and is supporting her. How, I do not know. But it bothers me because I feel like he is freeloading off of me and subtly taking advantage of me now. For example, when we go grocery shopping he asks to put his groceries in my cart and pay for our groceries together. I am afraid of getting into an argument with him over money because he is easily offended and sensitive (based on past conversations about money) so I just say sure. Then I have to tally up what he owes, I have two outstanding tabs for him. I once sent him the Excel sheet of the breakdown and he made fun of me and called me a Jew. (I am not Jewish.)\n\nHe stays over at my apartment every weekend. Even before his sister moved in with him he wouldn't want me to come over to his apartment on weekends. This all started after he quit his job. Maybe I am overthinking it but I really feel like he wants to be at my place just so he can freeload off of my cable and food so he doesn't have to use up what he has at home.\n\nI finally said something after our recent trip to the grocery store. He picked out shampoo and a candle for his sister and paid for it on his own. But he put his groceries in my basket.\n\nSo when he was leaving my apartment I was taking his food out of the freezer and asked him to pay me back for this stuff. He said in a joking whiny voice, \"I am poor!\" And I said, \"obviously you're not that poor if you are buying your sister candles.\"\n\nHe immediately got mad at me and said I was nasty. But I am fed up. It is ridiculous now.\n\nAITA for making that comment to him?

Tell him it is over, you need to move on to someone who will contribute to the relationship both physically and financially.  Good luck.", "NTA stop paying for anything of his at all. Go grocery shopping alone. Better yet realize this is your future if you stay with him and cut the dead weight.", "She\u2019s dating a sponge", "Hobosexual.", "I think that it is easy to assume people in their 30s should have their sh\\*t together but life does throw some wild curveballs and so some people have to restart or are behind. I think it's more important to know if someone is trying and you believe will succeed as opposed to only dating people who have it all sorted right now because sometimes those people are really immature because aside from work and a home etc they haven't really experienced much outside. \n\nHowever, I agree he is not that person and that OP should leave him. He is gross.", "This. He's showing OP who he is and she should believe him. \n\nNTA", "OP shops have stood up to him a long time ago though. Like.. buy him groceries once and then send a Venmo request immediately after. If he doesn\u2019t pay then say NO the next time you\u2019re at the store or even I to the store on your own. He can\u2019t force you to pay for his groceries \u2014 OP has allowed him to be an AH to her.", "I get the feeling she has no problem with the freeloading loser being an antisemite. OP was offended by being called a Jew. Not the antisemitism behind the statement. Notice how quick she was to assure everyone she\u2019s not Jewish. \n\nThe freeloader is antisemitic trash (probably not his only bias) and it appears OP is ok with that. Or she would have dumped him long before he became a financial burden. That makes her just as bad as him.\n\nThey should stay together and not inflict themselves on anyone else.", "Stop buying his stuff and watch how quickly his demeanor changes.

If they\u2019ve been together as long as it seems the this wouldn\u2019t be the first time he would have said something like that. And usually people who perpetuate those stereotypes and biases often have others. \n\nAnd the fact that she was quick to point out how she isn\u2019t Jewish (as if that matters) and just shook it off, means that she doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree with his sentiment, has heard it before, and seems to be just fine with it. Her problem isn\u2019t the antisemitism, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s a freeloader.", "It\u2019s literally textbook antisemitism.", "Thanks", "Exactly. We don\u2019t know what she says to him.

I just took it as \u201cI\u2019m not Jewish, this isn\u2019t okay\u201d rather than something like, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not Jewish.\u201d", "I don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nHe called her a Jew when she asked to be repaid. Unless OP slept through every History class, knows nothing about the 20th century and the stereotypes used to dehumanize Jews for centuries, she had to know what he meant. \n\nAnd unless OP is oblivious to the world around her, there\u2019s just no excuse for treating that comment as anything other than a slur.\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s a good thing to give people the benefit of the doubt. But when it comes to language or actions that make any group of people \u201cless than\u201d, the benefit of the doubt is unwarranted.
