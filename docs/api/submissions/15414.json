He now works a cleaning job for two hours a night that pays him enough to, in his words, \"barely get by.\"\n\nHis sister (49F) recently moved back from being overseas and is currently living with him. She is unemployed as well and also does not want to work. My bf pays for everything and is supporting her. How, I do not know. But it bothers me because I feel like he is freeloading off of me and subtly taking advantage of me now. For example, when we go grocery shopping he asks to put his groceries in my cart and pay for our groceries together. I am afraid of getting into an argument with him over money because he is easily offended and sensitive (based on past conversations about money) so I just say sure. Then I have to tally up what he owes, I have two outstanding tabs for him. I once sent him the Excel sheet of the breakdown and he made fun of me and called me a Jew. (I am not Jewish.)\n\nHe stays over at my apartment every weekend. Even before his sister moved in with him he wouldn't want me to come over to his apartment on weekends. This all started after he quit his job. Maybe I am overthinking it but I really feel like he wants to be at my place just so he can freeload off of my cable and food so he doesn't have to use up what he has at home.\n\nI finally said something after our recent trip to the grocery store. He picked out shampoo and a candle for his sister and paid for it on his own. But he put his groceries in my basket.\n\nSo when he was leaving my apartment I was taking his food out of the freezer and asked him to pay me back for this stuff. He said in a joking whiny voice, \"I am poor!\" And I said, \"obviously you're not that poor if you are buying your sister candles.\"\n\nHe immediately got mad at me and said I was nasty. But I am fed up. It is ridiculous now.\n\nAITA for making that comment to him?

You just said that he is disgusting - why would you accept a relationship with someone who is disgusting and who calls you names?\n\nThis was your LAST grocery shopping trip with him. Tell him you're through, the relationship is over, and make it stick. You CAN do this, low self esteem or not. You do NOT need a man in your life to have a happy life, and in this case the man you do have seems to be standing between you and a happy life anyway. Some men are much worse than no man at all and he's one of them. So show him the door.\n\nIf he has a key to your place, retrieve it; if not, change the locks. Do this on Monday. Do not take his calls - if he begins calling you constantly block his number. \n\nAnd if you've paid for any of those groceries, those groceries stay in your kitchen as he walks out your door.

When will he grow up and realize that it's inevitable, he has to pay you back. You need to dump his ass, or teach him to be a responsible adult and tell him to get a job.
