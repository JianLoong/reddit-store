Same situation here. Kids play in my driveway and backyard instead of their own. I ignored it until I started finding trash and toys on my property, and then gum and food stuck to the side of my house. A couple months later, the older kids friends were parking in my driveway when visiting them. That's where the line was finally drawn. I don't want to be \"that\" neighbor, but there's truth to the \"give an inch, they take a foot\" saying.", "NTA. That's not a good neighbor.", "**NTA**. This is a huge safety and liability issue.

That's what sprinklers are for?", "NTA.  The only times I can remember neighbors playing in my yard is when I was a kid myself.  There was a swarm of like 15ish of us who were within a few years in age who played together sometimes, and that would often end up with water balloons or water guns going over large parts of the street.  There were a couple houses where we avoided the yards because we\u2019d been told to, but everyone else was pretty tolerant of us.  Probably helped that we were good kids and didn\u2019t mess things up, stayed out of flowerbeds and such.\n\nBut that\u2019s a very different situation from one household choosing to use your yard instead of your own - that\u2019s entirely different.", "NTA\n\n1.  If they get injured on your property, you can be held responsible for their bills, which means your homeowners insurance will increase. \n\n2.  They were trespassing on your private property. \n\n3.  They could damage your home, vehicle, or property throwing a ball. \n\nIf it happens again, send a cease and desist letter. Get cameras up in case something happens, or they try to retaliate.", "Nta. Your property your rules.", "NTA \n\nI wouldn't call the police but I would drop in the next time I passed by to find out what the law actually says. \n\nI'd probably let the parents know that I stopped by the police precinct, if it persists.\n\nThen I would follow the directions given to me, if the behavior persists.\n\nI would be less concerned about being \"that\" neighbor than I would for having an uninvited person injured on my property, or my property damaged by uninvited people.", "NTA. I\u2019m concerned by playing ball from across the street. I\u2019m afraid one of the kids would get hit by a car or something.", "NTA.\nAside from them having their own yard, if one of them gets injured on your property, they can sue you for damages. \nCall the cops next time and have them removed. Trespass them if necessary.", "What if a child got run over because they were playing in a driveway? NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
