But I don't think your response was necessarily called for.\n\nI believe your parents did put in a lot of effort to get him on the right track and save him from himself, but through that I'm sure there was a huge internal upset. I doubt there wasn't at least one night where he wondered why he was so worthless that he needed his parents to help him out so much. People may seem one way on the surface, but everyone has internal battles. It seems like he was a kid that just learned differently, and through his struggles in school, convinced himself it wasn't worth it if he couldn't learn like everyone else, and started to self sabotage. Probably to the point he asked himself why he did those things but still wasn't able to stop himself. Like you said, you guys didn't have access to therapy, maybe he's been struggling with depression and some other mental things that made him feel different and even \"wrong.\" You telling him that all he does is fuck up everything probably doesn't make that any better. He knows why you're the golden child, he knows the effort you put in and how you strived, he's jealous of that because he never understood why it didn't come to him the same way it did to you. And to bring mom and dad into this, and for them to agree that he was a fuck up really just validates his feelings that he will never be accepted for what he is able to do. You probably made him feel pretty worthless, which might be what you think he deserves, but I personally don't believe anyone should ever feel that way.\n\nAgain, I know he kept calling you a golden child, but I think you also crossed a different line.", "YTA. Your brother had behavioural problems as a child and your parents tried to punish him out of them, probably while repeating \"why can't you be more like your brother\" ad nauseam. He only got attention when he messed up, so he did that a lot (which is quite common for siblings of golden children).

The knock on impact of being treated as 'less than' my golden child older sibling was that I rebelled at school (because it was always made clear to me that I would never be as good as her), I made many many bad decisions (an effort to dull the pain), and I still now struggle with feeling unloved. \n\nIt worries me that your parents take sides between you; my (lovely) mum always tries to get us to see each others perspectives, and meet in the middle, whilst my narcissist father is the one who takes sides.\n\nIf I am right to suspect that this is the dynamic at play here, then this is no more your fault than your siblings so I say NAH, and please, do some research on scapegoat/golden child family dynamics, and perhaps try to be a little more objective/consider your siblings perspective/have a calm conversation about why they feel that way. In many situations people who work hard and also are given privileges struggle to recognise that their peers weren't given an equal start.", "By chance does your brother have any mental health or learning disabilities? I ask because I had some similar issues but not to the same extent. I found out at 30 I had the combined form of ADHD which when I medicated leaded to serious focus issues and substance abuse. The substance abuse form of ADHD typically manifests in drugs that help you shut off your brain. Hence I noticed the weed in high school. I did that and got in rafts of shit.\n\nI was a horrible student in undergrad. Academic probation 2.5 years and barely graduated. I waited 10 years and tried for law school. Did terrible on the lsat but got a trial admission program. It was about then that I started my ADHD medication. Not only did I get in, I became a top student and graduated with Latin honors. The medication has been a godsend in n my life and has changed me completely. \n\nMy family has commented multiple times they wish they would have pushed the issue when I was younger but they thought I was just misbehaved and it was a period I\u2019d get through. Have to admit I have resentment bc they teased me and always compared me to my older sisters. When I found out about the ADHD, it all became clear and my issues made sense.", "First off, NTA.  \n\nI do feel bad for your brother, it's possible there was an undiagnosed learning disability and he was acting out as school got more and more difficult for him. I would suspect it even more if he ends up thriving in the trades.  \n\nHowever, if he doesn't get over that chip on his shoulder, he may continue to act out as an adult and your relationship will continue to suffer.  \n\nIf you are feeling up to it, you could try to approach it again.  You could ask him what his experience as a kid in your family was like, how it made him feel, and even why he thought things were like that.  Maybe that could lead to a conversation about him getting some therapy or help, or about what a handful he was as a kid.... Or ask if he was his own parent, what he would have done differently.", "Info: did your parents ever get your brother tested for learning disabilities?\n\nHe shouldn't have pushed your buttons.  But therapy was a thing 20 years ago and it was a thing 30 years ago so I call BS on that part of your story", "ESH", "I\u2019m wondering much of the same. \n\nAs a general rule, kids don\u2019t really go about life thinking \u201cI\u2019d love to be a fuck up who feels hated by my family\u201d. So if he started acting out/having behavioural issues, there was very likely an unmet need he was trying to have fulfilled. Maybe school wasn\u2019t stimulating enough. Maybe he felt academically inferior so he adopted the \u201ctroubled teen\u201d identity to convince himself he wasn\u2019t stupid. Maybe he felt like he didn\u2019t get enough attention at home. There could be a whole host of reasons. But there *is* always a reason - even if he doesn\u2019t fully understand it himself. \n\nThat being said, a reason is not an excuse. From a psychological perspective, we just like to understand the reason so that we can work on adaptive change. So even though I can be empathetic toward the brother, it doesn\u2019t excuse his current-day behaviour toward OP. If he\u2019s unhappy with where he\u2019s at in life, it\u2019s on *him* to seek out therapy, engage in honest and vulnerable self-reflection, and start making adaptive change.", "She a woman, all the YTA votes are getting down voted. The bigotry that redditors have is insane.", "Dude we get it, you're the golden child and don't think it's a big deal. Go do something else with your time instead of commenting on every comment.", "Have you ever considered OP is maybe just a people pleaser? And while stealing the family car is a big nono,  cursing at a teacher can have different reasons. Some teachers are racists or even sexual assault people, so the teacher can be at fault here. He can also just have different Opinions then his parents and so he got the \"troublemaker\" and \"black sheep\" marking. I don't doubt he struggled and made mistakes, but giving the parents played favorites and OP isn't a reliable source (since she resents her brother) i doubt her perspective.\n\nESH", "Lmao you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.

But since he kept failing, you and your parents saw him as a failure, a screw up.. And again, as someone that has been there (and is still sees as such) he decided to stop knowing that regardless of what he did, he'd still be look down on from his own family.

My mother had severe depression and anger issues when we were little, and as my sister was more active (she was just heatly kid lol\ud83d\ude02) she got scolded more. Later my mom got better, and did better job as parent. I remember i tried to defend my sister, and after few times they atleast stopped to spank her. She was at first good student, later school was difficult for her and she acted out there because she couldn't do that at home.\nThere is always reason for child to act out like this.

But my stepmom drove me an hour and a half to get me when i was in middle school to Drs who eventually diagnosed by ADHD and that was 27 years ago.  Op's brother would have been 6 20 years ago.  If he was still having trouble in middle and high school which would have been 13 and 10 years ago, if they tried tutors I'm surprised no one suggested he might have a learning disability.\n\nOp's brother is the one who got himself into trouble and yes he is responsible for his own actions, but it's worth investigating potential causes."]}
