I doubt there wasn't at least one night where he wondered why he was so worthless that he needed his parents to help him out so much. People may seem one way on the surface, but everyone has internal battles. It seems like he was a kid that just learned differently, and through his struggles in school, convinced himself it wasn't worth it if he couldn't learn like everyone else, and started to self sabotage. Probably to the point he asked himself why he did those things but still wasn't able to stop himself. Like you said, you guys didn't have access to therapy, maybe he's been struggling with depression and some other mental things that made him feel different and even \"wrong.\" You telling him that all he does is fuck up everything probably doesn't make that any better. He knows why you're the golden child, he knows the effort you put in and how you strived, he's jealous of that because he never understood why it didn't come to him the same way it did to you. And to bring mom and dad into this, and for them to agree that he was a fuck up really just validates his feelings that he will never be accepted for what he is able to do. You probably made him feel pretty worthless, which might be what you think he deserves, but I personally don't believe anyone should ever feel that way.\n\nAgain, I know he kept calling you a golden child, but I think you also crossed a different line.", "YTA.

The knock on impact of being treated as 'less than' my golden child older sibling was that I rebelled at school (because it was always made clear to me that I would never be as good as her), I made many many bad decisions (an effort to dull the pain), and I still now struggle with feeling unloved. \n\nIt worries me that your parents take sides between you; my (lovely) mum always tries to get us to see each others perspectives, and meet in the middle, whilst my narcissist father is the one who takes sides.\n\nIf I am right to suspect that this is the dynamic at play here, then this is no more your fault than your siblings so I say NAH, and please, do some research on scapegoat/golden child family dynamics, and perhaps try to be a little more objective/consider your siblings perspective/have a calm conversation about why they feel that way. In many situations people who work hard and also are given privileges struggle to recognise that their peers weren't given an equal start.", "By chance does your brother have any mental health or learning disabilities? I ask because I had some similar issues but not to the same extent. I found out at 30 I had the combined form of ADHD which when I medicated leaded to serious focus issues and substance abuse. The substance abuse form of ADHD typically manifests in drugs that help you shut off your brain. Hence I noticed the weed in high school. I did that and got in rafts of shit.\n\nI was a horrible student in undergrad. Academic probation 2.5 years and barely graduated. I waited 10 years and tried for law school. Did terrible on the lsat but got a trial admission program. It was about then that I started my ADHD medication. Not only did I get in, I became a top student and graduated with Latin honors. The medication has been a godsend in n my life and has changed me completely. \n\nMy family has commented multiple times they wish they would have pushed the issue when I was younger but they thought I was just misbehaved and it was a period I\u2019d get through. Have to admit I have resentment bc they teased me and always compared me to my older sisters. When I found out about the ADHD, it all became clear and my issues made sense.", "First off, NTA.  \n\nI do feel bad for your brother, it's possible there was an undiagnosed learning disability and he was acting out as school got more and more difficult for him. I would suspect it even more if he ends up thriving in the trades.  \n\nHowever, if he doesn't get over that chip on his shoulder, he may continue to act out as an adult and your relationship will continue to suffer.  \n\nIf you are feeling up to it, you could try to approach it again.  You could ask him what his experience as a kid in your family was like, how it made him feel, and even why he thought things were like that.  Maybe that could lead to a conversation about him getting some therapy or help, or about what a handful he was as a kid.... Or ask if he was his own parent, what he would have done differently.", "Info: did your parents ever get your brother tested for learning disabilities?\n\nHe shouldn't have pushed your buttons.

So if he started acting out/having behavioural issues, there was very likely an unmet need he was trying to have fulfilled. Maybe school wasn\u2019t stimulating enough. Maybe he felt academically inferior so he adopted the \u201ctroubled teen\u201d identity to convince himself he wasn\u2019t stupid. Maybe he felt like he didn\u2019t get enough attention at home. There could be a whole host of reasons. But there *is* always a reason - even if he doesn\u2019t fully understand it himself. \n\nThat being said, a reason is not an excuse. From a psychological perspective, we just like to understand the reason so that we can work on adaptive change. So even though I can be empathetic toward the brother, it doesn\u2019t excuse his current-day behaviour toward OP.

There are still many places where it's difficult to get a therapist, even some regions in the US.", "Maybe OP lives in a country/place where getting mental help (20 years ago) would've been seen as a taboo or something to be ashamed of.\n\nEDIT: Added the term \"place\", this could still be in the US", "\"I didn't have this problem, so obviously no one else could have had it\". I can tell you for a fact that going to a therapist in Eastern Europe in early 2000 was not a thing.", "Also, they don't really know what \"acting out\" really means?\n\nBecause they use it to mean he was misbehaving, but the phrase comes from understanding that when we're not allowed to express our emotions/thoughts/selves it inevitable overflows into our actions. \n\nWhen someone is \"actions g out\", it means they're acting out _the emotions_ that don't have a place otherwise. \n\n\"Acting out\" means there's an underlying reason for the acting. \n\nI don't know why I care about this, but it's the second time I see it today and it's been bothering me for some reason.", "\n\nA series of private tutors is punishment?\n\nBut yes, he did receive some consequences for skipping school, stealing and cursing at his teachers. That is part of parenting.\n\nI would hope that one of the ways his parents tried to help him included therapy for whatever is causing him to  act out, but that still doesn\u2019t make OP the golden child.\n\nA golden child is chosen by the parents as \u201cspecial\u201d regardless of the abilities of the other children. Their specialness is not really linked to their behavior, and if anything they get away with more than their siblings.\nIf that were the case, OP would be consistently given more than her brother for no reason. It sounds like they were more than happy to give him the same privileges as her, and that the consequences for either of them misbehaving would be to lose the same privileges. OP just never did the problematic behaviors her brother did.", "Even rural parts of the US it's impossible. I mean yes there's stigma, but also good luck finding it. Even today it's hard but kind of doable if you have the money for telehealth appointments. 10-20 years ago, nope. We had to stay with family in Atlanta  to get my brother tested for ADHD. There were no options close to us. None. It was a four hour drive and took weeks of appointments. If crashing in an Uncles guest room wasn't an option it wouldn't have happened. Which is why most in my area don't do it, they can't.", "Okay? Not everyone's that lucky to have the time, money or the location to be able to do that.", "Okay, but OPs parents *moved* to give them a fresh start (so probably to a different school district), and still decided proximity to therapy was not a priority. They had the means to straight up move because of his issues, but not enough to treat them?", "I was diagnosed by a PCP and not a therapist.  I'm just asking op if her parents tried.  If the options weren't available then there's nothing they could do but we don't know if they were rural or in a city.  I'm not making an assumptions on OP's family situation. That's why I asked info.", "Because not everyone can afford living in or near a city?", "Typically you aren't going to move to a more rural school to get more resources to help their kid since as you pointed out rural areas don't have as many resources.   You are arguing in circles just to argue at this point", "NTA\nyeah may be he didn't \"start acting out suddenly\" or \"he must have some mental issues\" or \"undiagnosed something\" but thats still will be called as acting out especially from the view of parents or siblings. If i was to speak about parents ,they were definitely tired of clearing his mess again and again so obviously you, who was not at all messy or may be less messy than him, will be a golden child automatically. he can hate his parents for that or can even hate you but pushing your buttons repeatedly and then Calling you a AH for getting annoyed was not it for me. I am trying to see this from the OP perspective because everyone else are making it about him struggling. Yeah he might have struggled. But his sister is not responsible for his actions. Not her fault that she didn't gave her parents hard time. The parents are also humans tho. and why people acting like they abandoned him? Because as i am reading OP it seems like they literally tried everything! Tutor, punishment, keeping eyes on his company (to know enough who he was hanging out), gave him enough time to heal. So parents dis tried their best. So I don't think anyone in this situation is a AH. Same family different people having different experience and thinking each other as FAULT.", "\"Good for a month then would **steal the family car**... parents tried, but therapy wasn't a think back where we were **20 years ago**.\" So if he is 26, he was stealing cars at age 6?.. I'm not even mad, that's pretty impressive. /s\n\nIn all seriousness, stealing a car isn't good - but it sounds more like it was used the car when he wasn't allowed to. Cussing at a teacher really isn't awful, if it is justified... screw 'respect your elder' - it doesn't mean anything if that respect isn't given both ways. \n\nIt is really hard to imagine there wasn't a single counselor during your high-school years, around 2013.. so I am not sure how hard your parents tried. Grounding a kid takes 0 effort, but keeping him clean, ensuring he is turning stuff in (constant monitoring and communications with him and his teachers) is a lot of work. What parents keep the punishment the same if it results in the same outcome, next time?\n\nAll this being said, he pushed your buttons and you finally had enough. I don't think he is a screw up, especially if he went to trade school. What you said was mean, and untrue (over exaggeration). I am going on a limb and saying ESH.", "INFO\n\nDo either of you suspect that your parent(s) is/are narcissistic?\n\nThe Golden Child/black sheep dynamic between parents and children can be indicitive of narc parents. \n\nAlso is your brother on the spectrum? a lot of what you described sounds like undiagnosed adhd. \n\nI feel like everyone would benefit from a clearer idea of your brother's perspective.", "NTA but of course your parents are gonna side with you if you are the golden child", "Right, like why would that interaction evoke a \u201cgolden child\u201d response? If brother had actually mentioned an issue with their car, would dad not have also offered to have a look at it? \n\nSounds like his parents bent over backwards to help him out, getting him tutors (holy expensive), housing him the whole time he was in trade school\u2026. How is it unfair for OP to get a favour from them every now and then?\n\nOP was kind of cringe for phrasing it like she *was* the golden child or like brother was \u201cfucking up,\u201d because she\u2019s just giving brother something else to feel justified in being mad about and reaffirming his greatest fear that everyone thinks OP is better than him. It\u2019s better to be specific. \u201cYou get out what you put in. I put in effort to behave respectfully and generously. As a result, people treat me with respect and generosity. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d", "It's possible.. in my country Therapy is still not a normal thing.. In my town most of the people doesn't even know wtf is therapy...", "Yep. Also -\n\n> He kept messing up, he got in bad crowd and was found with weed at school. We moved to start fresh.\n\nKinda wild that they upended and moved the entire family because they found him with weed. \n\nI dont think your parents are blameless in this. Just feels like this is missing a lot of context.", "Agreed- it sounds like it got bad enough that the whole family moved. That's an extreme reaction for getting busted with marijuana and I really wonder how much help OP's brother had coping with whatever was going on in his life. It honestly sounds like none.\n\nI do understand that some kids just react poorly to authority and that it's not always the parents' fault, but I think those situations are relatively rare.", "I know that this isn't like a universal experience ... but the reason I didn't turn in homework when I was younger is because of my Dyslexia and ADD (it took me 3x as long as most of my peers to complete homework and I just couldn't keep track of what had to be done when). My parents punishing me for the ways my brain didn't like everyone else's led me to act out too.", "Totally agree. Kinda the way it happened for me. I have a hard time with my feelings related to it because  ADHD wasn\u2019t nearly as common when I was a kid and kids went undiagnosed much more often back then. I don\u2019t totally blame my parents. My mom tried therapy as a kid to rule out autism but it didn\u2019t last after that. Had social issues and hard time understanding social cues so naturally pushed away from normal social groups as weird as a kid which pushed me to the bad circles. Not knowing why was the worst part cause that was always the question from family. For the longest time it was I don\u2019t know how to explain it. \n\nTook me being an adult and going through 4 therapist till one started to notice and prod be in areas slowly and drew it out over time. I\u2019d subconsciously fight him every step almost like a fight or flight response. Nothing was wrong because they couldn\u2019t understand it. Until the eventually did. A lot of times if this is involved, no one is really TA. It\u2019s frustrating to deal with and resources are scarce in many areas and a lot of lack of education on it and down right disregard from many who can\u2019t comprehend outside their own experiences. Over time family gets tired from having to deal with it which leads to quicker arguments and the like. Siblings get left out and treated differently bc most parents aren\u2019t truly equipped to handle it and don\u2019t have enough help. \n\nDef not an excuse though. I made mistakes till I personally made the decision to get the help and not stop till I figure out what it it.", "I lived in a rural area and therapy was not a thing in 2000 there. That being said, the ages do not line up with a 20 year lag so something is off here.", "I'm also confused by \"therapy didn't exist where we were 20 years ago\"\n\nBut the brother is 26. So was he needing therapy as early as 6 years old, and wasn't getting help? Even if they didn't have therapy back then, they certainly had therapy 12 years ago when he was a troubled 14 year old (going off of the beginning of hs comment) \n\nWhile the OP didn't do anything wrong, I get the feeling the parents may have failed him more than they realize", "TBF cursing at a teacher could mean a lot of things, from arguing for a bad grade you think is undeserved to shouting to his face threatening to kill him", "You are a very angry pothead and need to lay off the weed.
