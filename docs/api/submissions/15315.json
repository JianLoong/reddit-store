He\u2019s the one solely responsible for his misfortune.  It sounds like he newly heard that term & decided he fit it.

He started it, he should\u2019ve expected it to come back to him", "NTA. If your brother wanted to be an idiot, he should have expected consequences.", "YTA you realize the 'golden child' is an abuse thing, right? Your response plays right into that...\n\nI love how you claim your parents did their best, but give no leeway *to a child* and perhaps he was doing his best, too?\n\nThere's also no shame in trade school *at all*, and going to college does not make you better than him.\n\nWonder why he might still be struggling with his place in the family? /s", "ESH but mainly you. I\u2019m a behavioral therapist and your brother clearly struggles and your tone about him is gross.", "ESH\n\nHe did start it, and he did push your buttons. But I don't think your response was necessarily called for.\n\nI believe your parents did put in a lot of effort to get him on the right track and save him from himself, but through that I'm sure there was a huge internal upset. I doubt there wasn't at least one night where he wondered why he was so worthless that he needed his parents to help him out so much. People may seem one way on the surface, but everyone has internal battles. It seems like he was a kid that just learned differently, and through his struggles in school, convinced himself it wasn't worth it if he couldn't learn like everyone else, and started to self sabotage. Probably to the point he asked himself why he did those things but still wasn't able to stop himself. Like you said, you guys didn't have access to therapy, maybe he's been struggling with depression and some other mental things that made him feel different and even \"wrong.\" You telling him that all he does is fuck up everything probably doesn't make that any better. He knows why you're the golden child, he knows the effort you put in and how you strived, he's jealous of that because he never understood why it didn't come to him the same way it did to you. And to bring mom and dad into this, and for them to agree that he was a fuck up really just validates his feelings that he will never be accepted for what he is able to do. You probably made him feel pretty worthless, which might be what you think he deserves, but I personally don't believe anyone should ever feel that way.\n\nAgain, I know he kept calling you a golden child, but I think you also crossed a different line.", "YTA. Your brother had behavioural problems as a child and your parents tried to punish him out of them, probably while repeating \"why can't you be more like your brother\" ad nauseam. He only got attention when he messed up, so he did that a lot (which is quite common for siblings of golden children). And now that you're adults, not only do you still fail to see the harm your parents caused him (and you too, though as a child you weren't to blame), but you still rub it in his face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doesn't sound sound like you're a golden child at all. It sounds like your brother is trying to justify the way your parents treat him. He's heard the term \"golden child\" and thinks that because your parents aren't fed up with you that you must be their golden child. Instead, you're probably their *favourite* child, a subtle difference, but come on, let's be honest, if I had 2 kids and one was problematic as hell and the other caused me no problems I'd have a preference, too.", "NTA.  Seems like a lot of your brother's problems stem from the fact that he has never taken responsibility for any of his actions ever.  And he continues that to this day.", "Are you mad because mommy and daddy loved your sibling more? Get over it. You\u2019re projecting. He was a fuck up. What leeway are they supposed to give him? He was failing school, they got him a tutor and he didn\u2019t wanna turn in his work. He got caught with weed in school which is an automatic expulsion in many schools. They moved so he could have a fresh start and he dropped out. Op may have some resentment for the way he acted but it\u2019s not her fault that he made poor decisions and she didn\u2019t.

He pushed her buttons, she snapped. End of story. Just because he couldn\u2019t get his shit together doesn\u2019t make it her fault. Her response was totally called for. You cant be the \u2018golden child\u2019, if there\u2019s two different types of kids. If one kid is actually going to school, working towards good grades, listens, helps out and the other one refuses to go to school, doesn\u2019t turn in homework, gets caught with weed and then drops out then there is no \u2018golden child\u2019. There were two children who were wildly different. If anything HE would be the golden child given how much attention he garnered over his antics and the fact that they literally moved to give him a fresh start.", "All she said was she needed her car looked at. Why does he get to stand there and constantly call her a name like that and she\u2019s not allowed to react? She snapped like any normal person would have because he pushed her to that point with his comments. He didn\u2019t have to say anything, if he has an issue with how he was raised he can talk to their parents but why is OP to blame for the way THEY treated him?", "I agree with you op is in fact the asshole", "But he\u2019s a fuck up.
