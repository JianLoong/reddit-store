Why should such a negative presence be allowed at your wedding anyway? \n\nSince she wants to be so vocal about her disapproval, not attending shouldn't be a problem for her. \n\nShe's likely to make a scene with either her words or her vibe alone. It's not her day, and if she can't at least be supportive, then she can stay home. \n\nIs your mother one of those who thinks no one is good enough for her son?", "NTA. You don't want negativity on your special day. Stay NC until she starts being respectful.", "Your mom thinks you are unreasonable because you want to marry a woman she's decided not to like.\n\n\nI would highly suggest security at the door if she knows the date, time, and venue.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, your mother needs to change her behaviour. I also feel like maybe you and her should go to family therapy and maybe include Samantha when the proper groundwork has been laid.", "NTA. But you also have a lot of time for things to change. I\u2019d lay down the law with mom. Either she accept and be kind to your fianc\u00e9e or she doesn\u2019t get to be at the wedding or in your lives.", "NTA OP and you did the right thing defending Samantha who deserves love and respect. Good on you being at her corner. I believe your mother is doing this to her because she feels threatened by Samantha which to me is not okay\n\nI am sorry that you did what you had to do but in the end Samantha's right to be free from your mum's toxic behaviour and drama matters the most. Remain NC on your mother until she changes her behaviour for the better for the sake of her relationship with you. \n\nMoving forward on this, do tell Samantha that she is loved and assure her this is not her fault", "NTA, you\u2019ve tried your best and it\u2019s putting a strain on your relationship. Hopefully she\u2019ll come to her senses and try to work this out for your sake", "NTA OP.  Your mom is, however.  If she can\u2019t see reason, then she needs to be permanently uninvited.", "Definitely NTA. You tried your best and your fianc\u00e9e even tried to make things right.\n\nIf your mom is so against you fianc\u00e9e, then she shouldn't care that she was uninvited to the wedding, right? Clearly she still wants to go even though she has been disrespectful to not only to your fianc\u00e9e, but your relationship.\n\nI hope your mom comes around.\n\nBest of luck to you and your wonderful fianc\u00e9e.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to talk to mom. She wont listen. \n\nIf you love your wife and want to marry her, you need to take a stand now. \n\nYou need to make sure mom and all family members know that its moms fault, as she is the one that is making everything difficult. You made attempts for peace, she rejected it.\n\nAnd if mom doesnt want to come to the wedding, she also can skip out on knowing the future grandchildren.", "Before we make a judgement shouldn\u2019t we be asking one massive question?  Why doesn\u2019t your mother like your fianc\u00e9e?\n\nIf my child was marrying someone who cheated on them multiple times (just as an example) I wouldn\u2019t be too fond of them either.", "When you marry you marry the entire family.    Curious why they didn't get off on the right track?     YTA  to put all the blame on your mother.    It's both of them.   There's jealousy involved.    I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.

This is to keep pre wedding shenanigans to a minimum. \n\nAlso, expect blow back from other family members for you being so meeeeean to your mother.

If you want a decent marriage you have to have your wife's back.", "The fact that she's blaming her temporary uninvite on Samantha is pretty much all you need to know that she's not going to change her mind.

You're not being unreasonable and are certainly NTA.", "NTA (reasoning below)\n\nWhat's the background with the pair? Have they had specific incidents?

Why does she want to watch you marry someone she considers unworthy of you? Tell her the truth! That you DO NOT TRUST HER to not ruin your and your fianc\u00e9s day and she can look at the pictures after. And if she promises to behave DO NOT BELIEVE HER! She\u2019s already blaming your fianc\u00e9e for this and is probably thinking of a way to ruin the day. Also I\u2019d be worried how she might treat any children y\u2019all have. If she hates your wife how will she talk about or to her in their presence. Low or no contact might be necessary at some point.", "NTA, but maybe a tad unrealistic. Uninviting your mother was never going to inspire her to start liking your fianc\u00e9e. It was all but guaranteed to *increase* her resentment, not decrease it. \n\nNotes for the future.

She accepted the invite and was 2 hours late. On top of that, she just walks into our home like it's her. And at this point, dinner was cold, and we had already eaten, and she had the audacity to sit down and demanded to be served. I politely told her to get up and get out of my house or I would call the police. She looked at me shocked but got up, cursing me out while I showed her to the door.", "NTA\n\nYour mum sounds like a piece of work, and it's YOUR wedding so you're not wrong in your choice of removing her from the day when there is so much conflict.\n\nI'm a bit blown away at threatening to call the police, but I'm not here to judge your dynamics outside the post. Thank you for taking the time to explain, best wishes to you both on your special day, which I hope will be drama free ."]}
