Your mom is your problem, not Samantha's. You need to permanently uninvite her. Make sure that she knows that she is the reason he's uninvited, not because of your fianc\u00e9.

If your mother doesn't like your fianc\u00e9e then she should keep quiet about it and be polite.

Your mom does not respect you or your fianc\u00e9. I would also mention to your mother that you are a grown adult, and Samantha is whom you have chosen to be your life partner and hopefully the mother of your future children.

Someone who openly criticizes either the bride or groom should not be invited to the wedding. That's basic science. \n\nI don't know that uninviting your mom will help build the relationship though. It sounds like boundaries are more in order (which you did) and then reinforcing them when your mom steps out of line or going NC/LC for time periods and trying again. \n\nI would suggest couples or premarital counseling with a licensed therapist. It's good in general to make sure you and your fianc\u00e9e are communicating well and address all the points needed before marriage (how will you handle finances, do you each want kids, how will you raise potential kids, etc.). But you can also talk about this issue and get a professional's help with it.", "NTA, you need to think about how your Mother's behavior is just going to continue.

Your fianc\u00e9 is your priority and should be the center of your life. So good on you for already establishing that!

Here's a hint... nothing happened. Your mom is just an unpleasant person. \n\nSo, time to grow a nice shiny spine, and tell your mom \"Hey, you're out. You can't act like an adult, so no more wedding invite for you, period. Not temporarily, not a maybe, flat out no. \n\nYou are allowed to call me after the wedding, and we can ***discuss*** the possibility of you being in our lives.\"\n\nBut keep in mind, this requires you to be willing to do something that it sounds like you have never done before... actually stand up to your mother."]}
