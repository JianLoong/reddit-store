Being the only girl from a rich family, she was very spoiled and always gets her way. Both 4 brothers are married and us wives pretty much get along, except that our SIL (Denise) is hard to deal with. \n\nIt is a very close family and we work together since it is a family business. Denise has always commented on the older bro's wife (Anne)'s weight.\n\nA few months ago Anne had a gastric bypass surgery so she's been losing weight. Denise has been bitter about all the compliments and attention that Anne is getting. We had a ladies' night out and met Anne's old classmate who was absolutely stunned by how much Anne changed.\n\nShe complimented her and asked what she did. She said that it was diet and exercise. Denise called her out that \"she was lying, she had gone under the knife and had her stomach removed\". Anne was extremely embarrassed and wanted to go home right away.\n\nKeep in mind that she traveled abroad to get it done since where I come from it is a taboo topic. The classmate spread the word. Anne's teenage kid asked if she's had surgery since a classmate spread the rumor at school.\n\nAnne had a huge argument with Denise. Denise didn't want to apologize she instead said that it wasn't her fault that Anne was pigging out on everything to the point she needed surgery. I've never had any argument with Denise before. But this time around, I lost it and told her that her top-heavy body won't let me wear whatever I want, yet she is shaming Anne. She's been crying, my husband and parents in law want me to apologize.\n\nA little back story. Denise hates her body shape. I usually respect her requests and she's 15 years older. She's asked me not to wear a similar outfit if we're going to the same place because \"it made hers look bad\". \n\nShe let me know ahead what not to wear. I never cared, until we both went to my niece's wedding a week ago, and couldn't wear a dress I picked with my older sister. I compromised since she refused to go and started to yell at my husband who asked her to stop harassing me.\n\nMy sister wondered why I wore something else. I explained and she was very upset and thought it was abusive and told SIL off.\n\nListening to her shaming Anne, while I was still upset about the wedding made me very upset and found myself shaming her in return. Which was wrong.\n\nMy husband proposed that Denise apologize to Anne, then I apologize to Denise. Which seems fair, but Denise refuse. So, my husband changed sides stating that she shouldn't ditch it if she can't take it.\n\nSo should I apologize for being the AH or stand my ground? \n\nSorry for any spelling or vocabulary mistakes.

While I think your SIL shouldn't have lied about how she lost the weight, it wasn't Denise's place to embarass her nor tell anyone. Also, who is she to police what you wear? NTA. Don't apologize. I can't stand people who are fine insulting/belittling others, yet when they get a taste of their own medicine then it's wrong and they're the victim. DENISE IS A BULLY.", "NTA. \n\nThank you for standing up for Anne. Denise shouldn't have outed her like that, especially if this topic is something really heavy in your society. I know people can be horribly judgemental about this kind of thing, and it was plainly wrong of Denise to reveal a personal thing like this, causing it to spread like wildfire. \n\nAlso, how dare she body-shame Anne for so long, despite having her own body-image issues! Does she not realise how devastating comments can be? I mean she has her own issues with the exact thing, so she must know the damage she's been causing, and must fully realise how much she's hurt Anne, not just with all her comments, but even by her recent outing of her procedure. \n\nI also appreciate that your husband tried getting her to apologise first, and for then telling you you weren't wrong after she refused to apologise. \n\nI think you should speak to her just to tell her that if she makes things right with Anne, you'll apologise to her, otherwise you stand by what you said. \n\nLet me re-iterate, you are NTA, you're awesome!", "NTA. If Denise can't apologize or see that she's behaved badly, you don't owe her an apology for your reaction. It's about time everyone stopped tiptoeing around her insecurity.", "NTA if she can dish it out she should be able to take it. Do not apologize.", "NTA. \n\nA few separate things. First: You should apologize if you genuinely feel that what you said was unjustified. Apologies you don't mean are just Machiavellian nonsense in my opinion. Given that she feels the need to dictate what other people wear and feels bitter that Anne is becoming healthier, I think your comment was reasonable and would not apologize in your position.\n\nSecond: Denise is definitely an AH in this situation. Regardless of the rest of the situation (with few exceptions, eg their own wedding), other people don't get to dictate what you wear and being bitter at someone for losing weight makes you an AH.\n\nThird: I don't know the cultural details, but generally saying that you achieved a look naturally when you didn't feeds into unrealistic expectations about what diet and exercise can do. I would say the same thing about people who take steroids and insist they got there through hard work. She might not really have a choice here, so I wouldn't say she was an AH.", "NTA. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all *unless you're ready to be put in your place.*", "ESH, if people don\u2019t lose weight through diet and exercise they shouldn\u2019t lie, now she doesn\u2019t have to say how she did it, that\u2019s personal And you weren\u2019t exactly kind yourself", "Well lets break it down \n\n1. Dinese had many times commented on Anne's wieght even thought she was overweight herself this makes her seem like a very shallow and hypocrytical person she is TA once \n\n2. It seems like Anne was being intensionally misleading with her explanation of how she got skinny but she dosent owe someone she hasnt seen in a long time an explenation\nesspeically if she is insecure about it she want NTA\n\n3. Dinese didnt have to say anything but she did and was perpousfully trying to make her look bad she is TA twice\n\n4. Dinese seems to think that Annes sugery is the only reason she is now skinny but from my knowlage a gastric bypass dosent automaticly make you lose weight she still had to eat healthy and exorsize so she technicaly wasn't lying this wakes dinese look like an ignorant person she was TA three times\n\n5. She tries to control what you wear becase she is insecure even though it dosent seem like shes trying to lose wieght this makes her seem like a lazy control freak she is double TA for this and is TA five times\n\n6. You calling her out in an insulting way would make you TA but she was doing what you called her out for, being rude and doing the same thing youre NTA\n\nSo you were NTA \nAnne was NTA \nBut Dinese was TA five times", "NTA not her story to share . She also seems annoying in general .", "ESH. She sounds like a nightmare. But you didn't defend somebody who needed your support. Instead you decided to act like a bully to insult the bully. Which is justified, but still makes you an AH just like she is an AH. You can apologize for your behavior without excusing or forgiving hers. IMO you should do just that. But I would take absolutely no more outfit requests or entertain any conversations about body image with her anymore, that's her issue to deal with and not take out on everyone else.", "ESH, your SIL has no right to body shame anyone else, but body shaming her in return, though it is an understandable reaction, is not right and not going to improve the situation in anyway", "ESH, obviously her way more than you. If only you worded it better, getting Denise to understand Anne\u2019s insecurities from Denise\u2019s own instead of insulting her.\n\nI think you should apologize anyway though if you care about yourself. At least doing that will mean whether or not Denise apologizes, you yourself are mature enough to do so.", "ESH, but her way more than you.

We had a family meeting two years ago about her comments on Anne's weight, in which her little brother said that even though Anne was bigger, she was still hotter than she will ever be. She got very upset and stopped working. A family meeting happened, they asked her to leave Anne alone and asked her brother to apologize. So, it seems like the same thing is happening all over again, now those who took her side previously are begging  me not to apologize. She's stopped working again, which will get everyone's attention.  I don't mind apologizing, but the rest of the family except her parents only want me ti apologize once she apologizes to Anne.", "You wouldn't know the half of it. I don't it is her fault though. She was the only girl with 4 brothers. She's very entitled.", "I actually don't mind apologizing. But having all SILs telling me that I will be letting them down considering that she constantly belittle everyone in the family has put me in the middle of their drama. I feel bad that she's missed work twice because she can't stand working with me. Now everyone is like, but Anne was going to work with her like nothing ever happened. I won't be changing my outfits anymore.", "Those are great points. What I said however justified, I admit that it was mean. Anne is the oldest of us and never ever starts drama unless it is necessary. Looking at her crying because her daughter was embarrassed of her surgery and the response Denise gave about her eating too much to the point she needed surgery made everything justified at the time, but once I cooled down, I knew I hurt her feelings.\n\nThe wedding was for my niece and she forbade me to wear a dress I specifically bought for this wedding and made a scene about it. Both incidents happened within three days apart. This might have influenced how I felt about her constant bullying and policing of us.\n\nI don't think Anne meant to be malicious. Our culture seems to be secretive and looks down on people who go through surgery to achieve certain beauty standards.  Also, Anne isn't close enough to the classmate shw hasn't seen in years, to the point that she can confide in her something so personal and that's flawed upon. Her spreading everything is proof enough that not telling her about surgery was the right call considering that even many in our families didn't know. They are now going to look down on her for stupid reasons.", "Sounds like you were absolutely right about her entitlement and need for attention and being spoiled from being the only girl in a rich family. Spot on.\n\nShe needs to be taught about her actions having consequences, and that's what's happening. What's surprising is even though her family is teaching her to apologise first, they're still treating her like you would a child. You teach a child that if they apologise, they will be apologised to for the retaliation. It's odd. \n\nAs long as it works though, I'm all for it. I don't think you owe her an apology unless she is willing to accept that her actions led to her feelings being hurt, and that she needs to stop being so nasty to people in general, and Anne in particular. I really hope she learns that, and I really hope she finds a way to do some damage control for Anne. Poor thing didn't deserve all the negativity.", "Well that's crappy of them. You can only control your own behavior and they control theirs. If you all don't like how Denise acts, any of you can say so at any time. Including you, you can apologize and still tell her that the way she acted was not ok. But it's not on you or any of you to speak for anyone else."]}
