Being the only girl from a rich family, she was very spoiled and always gets her way. Both 4 brothers are married and us wives pretty much get along, except that our SIL (Denise) is hard to deal with. \n\nIt is a very close family and we work together since it is a family business. Denise has always commented on the older bro's wife (Anne)'s weight.\n\nA few months ago Anne had a gastric bypass surgery so she's been losing weight. Denise has been bitter about all the compliments and attention that Anne is getting. We had a ladies' night out and met Anne's old classmate who was absolutely stunned by how much Anne changed.\n\nShe complimented her and asked what she did. She said that it was diet and exercise. Denise called her out that \"she was lying, she had gone under the knife and had her stomach removed\". Anne was extremely embarrassed and wanted to go home right away.\n\nKeep in mind that she traveled abroad to get it done since where I come from it is a taboo topic. The classmate spread the word. Anne's teenage kid asked if she's had surgery since a classmate spread the rumor at school.\n\nAnne had a huge argument with Denise. Denise didn't want to apologize she instead said that it wasn't her fault that Anne was pigging out on everything to the point she needed surgery. I've never had any argument with Denise before. But this time around, I lost it and told her that her top-heavy body won't let me wear whatever I want, yet she is shaming Anne. She's been crying, my husband and parents in law want me to apologize.\n\nA little back story. Denise hates her body shape. I usually respect her requests and she's 15 years older. She's asked me not to wear a similar outfit if we're going to the same place because \"it made hers look bad\". \n\nShe let me know ahead what not to wear. I never cared, until we both went to my niece's wedding a week ago, and couldn't wear a dress I picked with my older sister. I compromised since she refused to go and started to yell at my husband who asked her to stop harassing me.\n\nMy sister wondered why I wore something else. I explained and she was very upset and thought it was abusive and told SIL off.\n\nListening to her shaming Anne, while I was still upset about the wedding made me very upset and found myself shaming her in return. Which was wrong.\n\nMy husband proposed that Denise apologize to Anne, then I apologize to Denise. Which seems fair, but Denise refuse. So, my husband changed sides stating that she shouldn't ditch it if she can't take it.\n\nSo should I apologize for being the AH or stand my ground? \n\nSorry for any spelling or vocabulary mistakes.

We had a family meeting two years ago about her comments on Anne's weight, in which her little brother said that even though Anne was bigger, she was still hotter than she will ever be. She got very upset and stopped working. A family meeting happened, they asked her to leave Anne alone and asked her brother to apologize. So, it seems like the same thing is happening all over again, now those who took her side previously are begging  me not to apologize. She's stopped working again, which will get everyone's attention.  I don't mind apologizing, but the rest of the family except her parents only want me ti apologize once she apologizes to Anne.", "You wouldn't know the half of it. I don't it is her fault though. She was the only girl with 4 brothers. She's very entitled.", "I actually don't mind apologizing. But having all SILs telling me that I will be letting them down considering that she constantly belittle everyone in the family has put me in the middle of their drama. I feel bad that she's missed work twice because she can't stand working with me. Now everyone is like, but Anne was going to work with her like nothing ever happened. I won't be changing my outfits anymore.", "Those are great points. What I said however justified, I admit that it was mean. Anne is the oldest of us and never ever starts drama unless it is necessary. Looking at her crying because her daughter was embarrassed of her surgery and the response Denise gave about her eating too much to the point she needed surgery made everything justified at the time, but once I cooled down, I knew I hurt her feelings.\n\nThe wedding was for my niece and she forbade me to wear a dress I specifically bought for this wedding and made a scene about it. Both incidents happened within three days apart. This might have influenced how I felt about her constant bullying and policing of us.\n\nI don't think Anne meant to be malicious. Our culture seems to be secretive and looks down on people who go through surgery to achieve certain beauty standards.  Also, Anne isn't close enough to the classmate shw hasn't seen in years, to the point that she can confide in her something so personal and that's flawed upon. Her spreading everything is proof enough that not telling her about surgery was the right call considering that even many in our families didn't know. They are now going to look down on her for stupid reasons.", "Sounds like you were absolutely right about her entitlement and need for attention and being spoiled from being the only girl in a rich family. Spot on.\n\nShe needs to be taught about her actions having consequences, and that's what's happening. What's surprising is even though her family is teaching her to apologise first, they're still treating her like you would a child. You teach a child that if they apologise, they will be apologised to for the retaliation. It's odd. \n\nAs long as it works though, I'm all for it. I don't think you owe her an apology unless she is willing to accept that her actions led to her feelings being hurt, and that she needs to stop being so nasty to people in general, and Anne in particular. I really hope she learns that, and I really hope she finds a way to do some damage control for Anne. Poor thing didn't deserve all the negativity.", "Well that's crappy of them. You can only control your own behavior and they control theirs. If you all don't like how Denise acts, any of you can say so at any time. Including you, you can apologize and still tell her that the way she acted was not ok.

Oh, and wear whatever you want from now on.  It's not your fault you look better in some outfits than she does.  Also, my SIL just had gastric bypass surgery.  She has Lyme Disease and some of the medications she takes makes it hard for her to lose weight, so Anne's weight may not have been down to her diet anyway.

Bypass doesn't \"remove\" your stomach, it literally bypasses it. They make it much smaller but they're not taking it out of your body!

In no way does Anne need to share something so personal with people she barely knows.

And bypass greatly lowers your ability to process carbs & sugar so you can get dumping syndrome - sweating, shaking, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. You have to go on a liquid diet before and after the surgery and then re train your body to eat by starting with purees and working up to solids. You can develop severe vitamin deficiencies and lose your hair and even your teeth! Like, it's rough and not dangerous per se but can have serious consequences if you aren't really careful. It's definitely not \"easy\"", "I see", "As much as you're NTA you also didn't wear what you wanted because of you.

Had Anne had said it then she would be totally right in not apologizing. But FFS stop letting someone tell you what you can and cannot wear, just wear whatever you want. She's spoiled and you're catering to it just like everyone else.", "ESH , Sorry but Anne is a toxic AH if you can't be honest about a surgery you shouldn't get it.

In order for qualify for most gastric bypass, you do still need to diet and excel use to lose weight before the surgery.

Plenty of people are still extremely obese after surgery because they don\u2019t adopt a healthy lifestyle and put in the work, thinking that surgery is going to be a magic cure.", "You don't, actually. Aside from cost, a lot of people leave the country for the surgery because those countries don't have the requirements their own do for performing them. I do agree that people's surgeries are no one's business, as long as they don't hide them in an effort to put down others. I think with just HOW hush hush she's kept the surgery though, even to her kids, it's clearly about the stigma involved, and Denise is being nasty out of her own jealousy.", "You can only blame your upbringing for so long.

I\u2019m done.", "To be fair\u2026Anne is a cheater who lied about it, which sets unfair expectations for everyone else. It\u2019s that much easier for everyone to look at Denise now and say, \u201cWow, she\u2019s so lazy. Diet and exercise is clearly so easy, just look at Anne. Clearly she just doesn\u2019t care at all.\u201d \n\nThis is the same bullshit that happens when people inherit millions and pretend to be self made and then everyone is just like \u201cOh if you work hard and save your $15 an hour for 30 years you\u2019ll be a millionaire too\u201d when the truth is those millionaires are just lying about being self made. \n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable telling the world how you achieved your results (on an exam, in business, or in life), you shouldn\u2019t be comfortable using those methods to obtain results. Plain and simple. That\u2019s a basic tenet of life. If you feel you have to hide something, maybe think about not doing it at all.\n\nEdit: for people who don\u2019t think this is cheating (to be fair, when I call it cheating, I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t do it, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the easier way out) compare it to alcoholism. Imagine if an alcoholic had a surgery to reduce their addiction, then around other people a month later they casually said \u201cOh yeah, I worked through my addiction with the 12 steps and just a lot of hard work you know.\u201d Not only does that make other alcoholics look worse for being unable to do what he did, it discourages alcoholics trying to do the 12 steps and actually work hard because they\u2019ll think \u201cwell I\u2019m not doing as well as him and I\u2019ve been doing this process for months now and he did it in a month so maybe this won\u2019t work out for me after all\u201d.", "Agreed!

I don\u2019t see a good reason to defend her for either of those two things. \n\nHer medical issues are nobody\u2019s business, but when she tells people she lost weight through diet and exercise what she\u2019s saying is \u201cI did a lot of hard work\u201d and that means she\u2019s 1) made it their business and 2) tried to impress them at the same time with how diligent she is and how much self control she has. No one is obligated to stand there and cover her lie for her in that situation. Especially when the person being asked to cover the lie is the person everyone is secretly comparing Anne to in their head \u201cShe has so much self control\u2026compared to Denise over here.\u201d And if you want to tell me I\u2019m wrong then you\u2019ve never been around judgmental human beings before and you must live in a utopia. I\u2019ve literally heard people say shit like that out loud before. I\u2019ve seen people talk to their own families like that before. \n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m saying is maybe Anne\u2019s medical issues are nobody\u2019s business, but they certainly affect other people. And more importantly, the lies that come out of her mouth are definitely other people\u2019s business. Because: Lying. Is. Bad.", "Yes, but her lies are everyone\u2019s business.
