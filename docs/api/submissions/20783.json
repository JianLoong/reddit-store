Even if they were technically fine, as in she could chew and bite without issues, having wonky teeth can make a HUGE impact on one's self-esteem.", "Were you able to afford braces when she was younger?", "YTA.\n\nIt may be \"just cosmetic\" but it's something potential employers (among others) will judge her on. Straight white teeth are a class marker.", "YTA. Getting braces for \"cosmetic\" reasons is why they exist. You could have given her a much better life now if you had forked over the money when she was a teenager and gotten her teeth straightened. It's like you didn't even listen to what she had to say when she was a teen, and your responsibility as a parent is to care for the health of your child. Do you not understand what a stigma it is to have even slightly crooked, slightly overcrowded teeth? And later, if you were willing to pay for Smile Direct, why didn't you just pay for a real ortho?", "YTA, as someone who didn't get braces as a child, I got them myself when I was 30 years old as it was something that always bothering me and had to pay thousands. It's embarrassing to have braces at 30, especially because I might have gotten them for free as a child.", "I assume all the downvoted NTA replies are being downvotes by Americans who have a weird obsession with cosmetic dentistry.\n\nIf you had genuine advice from dentists that they weren't necessary - what else are you supposed to do? They're the professionals we are supposed to trust.\n\nI'm not American nor living in the US so very much in the \"so long as your teeth are healthy and cause no issues, leave them be\" camp.\n\nPart of being a parent is making the best decisions at the time, there's always going to be things you regret or get wrong... But i dont think you owe your daughter anything.\n\nIf you'd had medical advice that yes, she needs braces, and you hadn't bothered, this would be a different reply.\n\nBut I also think this is a cautious tale for using cowboy alignment places like SmileDirect or what it's called. Loads of them about right now. People should be going to the dentist to get braces not these online cheap places.", "Absolutely YTA. You commented before saying there was overcrowding going on when she got older yet you still didn\u2019t do anything except get something that would take longer to fix and did more damage. \n\nYou did basically neglect her needs when she very obviously did need them.", "She should get multiple consultations to make sure the work quoted is actually needed, and that expensive.  \n\nAnd while perceived cosmetic imperfections can give one a complex, she isn't entitled to braces any more than she would be a nose or boob job. I'm sorry for her distress, but now she's of an age she can get these things for herself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBraces aren't cheap and you had the recommendations of multiple dentists that it was largely unnecessary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially since dentists confirmed the only use for braces would\u2019ve been cosmetic, I think it\u2019s fair you never got them for her since they are super expensive. You would be TA if say you got other siblings braces but not her or something along those lines.\n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s fair that you did try to get the Smile Direct Club, obviously you got that only with the best interest in mind not thinking they\u2019d lead to an over bite. \n\nYeah, the situation sucks, but she\u2019s being dramatic IMO", "NTA... jeez kids are super entitled these days.\n\nSeems like dentists these days all want to put braces on everyone..last time i went to dentist they tried selling me on it, I asked.\".is it only for cosmetic reasons ???\" they said yes and i declined. I found out there is alot of subjective opinions on braces and what they can do...one dentist might want to move theet or jaw in one direction while another might want to move it back for some reason,.. I would get a second opinion if i were your daughter.\n\nShe is an adult, she can care for her own teeth. You paid for her first 18 years within reason and not asking to get paid back. Crossbites can develope at later age.", "Woah. I might get a lot of hate from this but your daughter sounds vain and now she\u2019s trying to manipulate you so she can have a better smile and feel pretty. What she doesn\u2019t know is the $7,500 is just for the braces. There are still the costs for after care, like check ups and retainers, etc.\n\nI say NTA. Braces are super expensive and if she wants the pretty smile, she can pay for it now that she is an adult. That\u2019s the other thing, she needs to start acting like an adult and stop blaming her problems on others.", "It depends on how terrible it was and also your financial situation\u2026 but I\u2019m going with NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe ruined her own mouth by complaining, now she can pay for her own braces since she wanted them so bad.", "NTA", "When they were a child, I agree.

Once she got into her early/late teens, yes.", "How does not paying for braces make her careless of her child\u2019s health?", "And aren't these cosmetic braces lifelong because my dentist said I didn't have to wear them anymore, but for my front gap, i would have to always wear them at night.", "Think you mean YTA in your first sentence", "OP said in a comment that she could afford to get her daughter braces as a teen, she just chose not to.", "OP said in a comment that she could afford to get her daughter braces as a teen.", "If you could have afforded it when she had that issue, I'd say YTA. If it would have been a hardship then NTA.", "are you a doctor qualified to say they are fine, or were you just cheap towards your daughter?", "YTA, because it sounds like you wouldn't let her get braces for your own prideful reasons.", "Then YTA", "Because it obviously affects her mental health. All those years though puberty, any social interaction, pictures, romantic endeavors, feeling too self conscious to smile or laugh around anyone. It damaged the way she viewed herself knowing that this was extremely important and being ignored even if it hurt her. It will affect jobs, adult relationships, college,.... all because of the mental trauma caused during childhood and it continues to be a problem. Her parents decisions are the direct reason why she faced this in the first place.", "Those are retainers. I wear retainers at night and they couldn't be less of an issue. They're actually quite comfy.", "No idea!\n\nI'd go to a real dentist to see about alignment etc, not fall for anything advertised on bloody TikTok!\n\nListen to your dentist!", "As the dentists said it was not necessary.", "the dentists said they were fine. it\u2019s in the original post.", "This right here", "Or because the medical professionals told her it wasn't necessary.", "You could say that about not spending thousands of dollars on designer clothes, accessories, gadgets, a car, etc. What a stupid thing to judge a parent for. Especially when a medical professional stated she didn't need them.", "Except for cosmetic reasons which sounds petty, but as a former green girl when your classmates look for anything to pick on you for.  Not so much.", "None of our dentists could decide whether our son needed braces. One said yes and refered him,one said no and told us we should cancel the appointment. We saw the orthodontist who took further x-rays and concluded he most definitely did need them. Dentists aren't orthodontists and don't make the right call all of the time. The referral to an orthodontist should have happened at least.", "I'm just saying, there were no health or function considerations to factor in, so it's not unreasonable to expect the daughter to pay for it herself.", "Mental health is a factor.  If she was repeatedly asking for them even after the others would have had theirs removed it was a big factor."]}
