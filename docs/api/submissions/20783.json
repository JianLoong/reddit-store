The point is to be confident in your own body. Otherwise, how is getting braces for only cosmetic purposes any different than plastic surgery? Would we be calling OP an ahole had the daughter been asking for a nose job for cosmetic purposes only, as a teenager? Likely not. Now, you did get her the smile thingy which did cause overbite. All because you wanted her to stop asking for braces. So maybe help her a little, because 7k is a lot of money. Explain yourself again to her, calmly, say you will help with a third or half (however much you can afford).

That would have been wasted money for her to eventually just have her teeth shift as her mouth grew into her teen/early adult years anyway. \n\nEdit- forgot to include this earlier but you absolutely can get braces before your mouth has stopped growing, it\u2019s just in more extreme and circumstantial situations. \n\nThose people in the comments who are saying \u201coh most people just get braces for straight teeth\u201d are uninformed liars.

No.", "YTA she needed braces for overcrowding teeth, this is a cosmetic issue and will turn into a dental issue as a result.  Smile direct club is not real dentistry.  I signed up for it and almost did it until they had me sign the waiver paperwork which clearly states many, many risks and says that they are not actually certified to do orthodontist work.  If an adult wants to take the risk and sign up for that crap, then fine but signing a minor up for smile direct is insanity. You really read their waiver and still thought it was a good idea? It clearly says if you have a misalignment, inverted teeth or overcrowded teeth you should seek treatment with an actual orthodontist or risk tooth loss and a lot of other issues.  I did Invisalign and my dentist told me he\u2019s has to correct many many patients that took matters into their own hands with smile direct and not all of the issues could be fixed, many patients had permanent loss of teeth.

On top of that, it does become harder and more expensive to sort out teeth as you get older, so realistically you could have actually saved the two of you some money. But the SmileDirect part is the part that makes you unbelievably an asshole. You made things worse through your own cheapness, laziness, and lack of empathy for your daughter\u2019s struggles.

I didn't grow up wealthy by any means but one of the things I am eternally grateful for is that my parents scrimped and saved so that I could have a lovely smile for the rest of my life.

I in turn have paid a ridiculous amount that I couldn't really afford (thank God for payment plans) to give my own kids orthodontics. Unfortunately teeth are one of those classist things that people really judge and I am so grateful that my parents were able to, and placed importance on, straightening my teeth.", "YTA - whether you think she needed them or not she obviously had/has major insecurities regarding her teeth and it sounds like you didn't help her handle those insecurities. It's one thing to want to help your child but are unable to afford it, it's a whole other story when you can afford them a better life but choose not to, or half ass it by using a terrible service such as Smile Direct. I have lots of dentist friends who are continuously having to correct oral issues caused by cowboy companies, whether it's beauticians incorrectly whitening teeth causing unrepairable gum damage, these teeth realignment companies, or in the UK \"Turkey teeth\" has become increasingly more popular. \nIt seems like there's irreparable damage to your and your daughter's relationship caused by this, first step to repair that could be to help pay for braces.", "YTA, she was upfront about her feelings and anxieties, and even though you admit you could afford proper braces you half-assed her dental treatment with a dubiously-reviewed company like Smile Direct instead. This is her FACE we\u2019re talking about, not something she can hide.\n\nI was also denied braces by my parents as teenager and I couldn\u2019t even smile in photos because I was so self-conscious of my teeth.

You didn\u2019t take her to the right person. \n\nIn addition, crooked teeth can be a major stigma in a society that reveres straight teeth as ours does. By her early teenage years you could afford braces and chose not to do them, despite the emotional and mental toll on her, the possibility of future dental problems, the social stigma of crooked teeth.

Let me explain because I have literally been in your daughters shoes:\n\n- I was the child who didn\u2019t get braces. I had overcrowding in my lower front teeth. \n- My brother got braces but because the dentist was more persistent with him \n- When I became 19 I had to get a root canal because the overcrowding was such that even though I used to brush and follow all hygiene procedures it wasn\u2019t enough to reach every corner of my mouth sufficiently. You allowed your daughter this risk, and general oral hygiene takes a dip due to overcrowding. \n- When I was a teenager I had severe anxiety and image issues because of my teeth. I had learnt to smile without showing my teeth and you know how young kids get. They comment on it and make you feel like shit. Seems like your daughter expressed this anxiety to you but you didn\u2019t care about it at all. \n- Now at 21 I had to get some intense orthodontics procedures which of course cost so much more than they would have if this issue was addressed as soon as it came up. My procedures lasted till last year and not to mention all this is INCREDIBLY painful the older you get. So so so painful. I have lost countless nights cause of the pain. Teenage gums are much more malleable and don\u2019t cause as much pain to the patient when these procedures are done. \n- It\u2019s also very common knowledge that gums have muscle memory. The longer you allow your teeth to be overcrowded/overlap, the more the chance that even post braces and all procedure they would go back to their original positions. This means either using removable retainers for a number of years or getting \u201cpermanent retainers\u201d which is basically glueing a wire at the back of your teeth (this is the solution I have now). The day I got to know I would still have 2 pieces of wire sitting in my mouth as a preventive measure after ALL that torture, for at least 20 years, I cried for hours in secret lol. \n\nALL this could have been avoided if I got treatment when I was a child. And I do hold some resentment against my father. Your daughter repeatedly begged you (which was something I did not do), and yet you still disregarded her concerns. I cannot imagine the kind of anger she would be feeling. \n\nI honestly feel you should be footing the entire treatment cost as well as genuinely apologising for this whole ordeal and mental stress you would have caused your child. \n\nThis post was so triggering for me lol", "YTA. Your daughter deserves a sparkling smile, not just functional teeth! Invest in her confidence!", "YTA, smile direct club is known for ruining teeth. \nthis is coming from somebody who had braces and looked them up to try to do minor work and didn\u2019t because of the risks involved.\nIf she had proper crowding i can\u2019t stress enough how much YTA. \ninvisalign is much safter as it\u2019s done with an orthodontist, you prob made her already bad teeth way worse hy trying smile direct club", "It's always interesting to see what hill some parents are willing to die on in exchange for their relationship with their child.

You did what you thought was best. \n\nAt my first job, aged around 18 I worked with a lady who was a good 10 yrs older than me, she wasn't traditionally \"good-looking\" necessarily, but she did ooze attractiveness.

Her hair was wild and big-like really big-wild curls somehow contained under a wide-brimmed hat. It wasn't only her hair under there. she also had a brain choc full of literature, music, wit and grit. I was in awe of her confidence, the way she entered a room and the way she didn't tolerate anything she wasn't 100% happy with. One day a group of us were sitting around in between calls chatting about if we would ever have cosmetic surgery and I said that I'd always been slightly insecure about the family nose, and if money was no object I would get a nose job. The woman wasn't previously involved in the conversation but suddenly interjected saying without my nose I would look boring beautiful. She said my nose made my face interesting and gave me character it would lack without it.

Orthopedics are expensive and if you don't have the funds and it isn't going to medically harm their child to have crooked teeth then it's not required and the parent shouldn't be shamed over it.
