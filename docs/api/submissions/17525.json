American here.  Being asked to bring a side is perfectly normal.", "NAH - I'm Australian, spent a lot of time in America, been to plenty of bbqs.

Didn't really see the point to that.", "As an Australian its custom to ask if can bring something to a casual gathering im invited to", "NAH. Gotta be a cultural thing. Where I'm from, unless its a wedding or birthday, you are expected to bring a side or  drinks (and wedding/birthday you are to bring a gift).  Even if person said don't bring anything, it's polite to offer and be expressly told not to. Ice is an appropriate item; doesn't have to be expensive, you just can't be a leech.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s customary in the US for invitees to ask what they can bring. For a large, informal, outdoor gathering what you asked is fine.", "NTA - I\u2019m an Australian living in Canada. I\u2019ve hosted many BBQ\u2019s both up north and down under. It\u2019s not trashy or low class at all to ask people to bring something. 100% you should start a group text or email otherwise people will be left to their own devices and you\u2019ll end up with a shit load of the same thing.", "NTA\n\n> My take was it\u2019s a BBQ and my friends ask what they can bring anyway.\n\nFuckin' a.\n\nIt would be **_one thing_** if you tried to offload *ALL* the food responsibilities onto your guests.\n\n> I am planning on smoking a brisket (or ribs depending on timing)/ chicken wings/brats and hotdogs for kids - spending about $200 including some beer and non-alcoholic drinks for 25/30 people.\n\nBut you *ABSOLUTELY are not*. \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\n\nRight now, tho, all I can think of is: \"Come to Homer's BBBQ.

When you're shelling out for premium cuts, it's the least people can do, IMO. Anyone who says otherwise is rich and also an AH, too.", "NTA \nAustralian and it's polite to bring something", "NTA - I'm gonna assume it's a culture thing and he's unfamiliar with the idea of the Pot Luck. It's not uncommon in the US, but perhaps it is very uncommon in Australia.\n\nE: changed my mind since pot luck is a thing in AUS too. \n\nOP should ask WHY he's so against this. Maybe it's a self-esteem thing and he things people will look down on you two or think you're poor or something? Otherwise I can't imagine why someone would be so against friends brining dishes to a large gathering.", "NTA.  If you are in America and these are Americans people are going to bring things anyways.  \n\nI love sign ups so i can sign up to bring drinks immediately.", "NTA\n\nA barbeque is an event people assume they will be bringing something for. I mean if it were a baby shower, bday party, wedding shower, etc. it might be tacky because those events are centered around one person so usually it is fully hosted by someone.\n\nI would also maybe think it's tacky if you were expecting the guests to provide the main dishes, as I think that's the host's responsibility, but it is perfectly fine to ask for sides/drinks/etc.", "Some people live for this and have special dishes they like to bring.

It's not un Australian to bring food to share at a barbie. Its also a great conversation starter to talk about who's brought something delicious", "Aussie here.

This is very normal in the US.  It was also standard practice when I lived with a bunch of international students in graduate housing.  We were all young, married couples and singles from the US, Britain, Mexico, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Japan, Vietnam, India and one guy I think was from Uzbekistan and whether it was the campus culture or all these cultures agreed I don't know, but in any case we all always brought a dish to every party and barbeque!", "American here. You ALWAYS  bring something.", "NAH.

A potluck\u2026 people expect to bring a dish.  A BBQ, it\u2019s hit or miss.

Where I am from originally you would never invite people over and then expect them to fork out for it. However now that I live in north America I think pot luck / bring a side is a great idea. Shits expensive", "If you are spending $9/person on meat and drinks that is not going very far in 2023. I\u2019m going to say NAH though, just double check your estimates on how much food and drinks for that many people.", "NTA But just because it's a BBQ doesn't automatically make it a potluck. A way you can handle it is to say it's a potluck when you're inviting people. If they don't feel comfortable bringing a dish they can decline, and you can coordinate who's bringing what with the guests who've accepted. \n\nWhen I'm hosting something I plan to provide the vast majority of items because I want my guests to enjoy themselves and not stress about entertaining since that's my job for the event. When people ask me if they can bring anything, I will usually ask them to bring something easy like a bottle of wine or store/bakery dessert. If I know they are good at cooking and enjoy it, I may ask them to bring a charcuterie or a side dish that won't take much effort.", "YTA\n\nI'm from the USA.\n\nI think it's rude to ASK people to bring sides, even to \"just a BBQ.\"  If they offer, suggest what they can bring.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t invite people over and then ask them to bring food, if they offer you can accept.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
