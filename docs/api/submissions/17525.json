Bring a plate is an well known opportunity for home cooking people to compete with who brings the best dishes to share.", "NTA", "We call this a potluck\n\nMost people will be happy to bring something", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty standard for invitees to be asked to bring a side or dessert.", "NTA\nI think I\u2019d even bring a side without someone having to ask me. Or some extra meat. Or some drinks. \nEspecially if all parties involved know how big of a BBQ it will be, I think they will definitely be understanding since it\u2019s a lot of food for a lot of people to 1) pay for, 2) prepare.\n\nIf your husband thinks it\u2019s tacky, he could chip in in costs and preparation next time to avoid this situation. You can always apologize to the people you invited saying you didn\u2019t know this isn\u2019t a thing where you live (and probably get the answer that it is not at all a big deal).", "info: is this the first bbq you and hubs have hosted?", "UK, most people once invited to a bbq will offer to bring something anyway. Even if I say no, they always come with either drinks, sides or meat to throw on. More sensible to coordinate so no one doubles up.", "NTA.  American as well, but will mention that truthfully I think it depends on what part of the states your from if it\u2019s considered rude or not.  It also depends on what type of party.  A bbq, picnic, potluck it\u2019s common to be asked to bring something.  Wedding, shower, birthday if you ask your a rude person (yes I was asked to bring a dish to a wedding).  As a women married to a Japanese man living in Japan, been invited to many home parties, and always always show up with something even if they say nothing is needed, you bring desserts or snacks,  and usually liquor.  It\u2019s just rude not too.  And the three bbqs I\u2019ve gone to we weren\u2019t asked but we brought sides and everyone else did as well.", "I am Dutch. If there is a party where you are asked to bring food or drinks, we call it an American party.", "Uk. My friends often ask what to bring. I just say a tub of coleslaw or beetroot from the shop. Nothing fancy. Just a small side", "I agree with you, in hispanic household its done to show some sort of respect. Every time we have or go to a get together of some sort mostly everyone brings a plate of some sort, everyone agrees on what to bring beforehand", "I've had really nice byo meat, host supplied sausages, steak and chicken if you wanted something else you bought it", "Most Australian bbqs I've been to have been byo meat.  They're like orgies: you bring your own meat and you're responsible for what you do with it.\n\nBut actually it's because meat and alcohol are usually the most expensive parts of the event.  This way, you don't need a second mortgage to have a party.", ">The only one I thought was odd was byo meat... Didn't really see the point to that.\n\nWe always did this back in school/uni because meat is expensive and we were mostly broke.", "Better to bring your own meat than the host trying to cater for everyone and then having lots of meat left over. I've been to those (where there's meat left over - cooked and uncooked) and there are people hunting around for containers so they can divvy up the meat (cooked and uncooked) for people to take home. It becomes very expensive and wasteful.", "It\u2019s what we do for family reunions. People bring sides or desserts and someone makes cooks meats at it. Family usually donates to a fund to buy the meet too.", "I think it's normal courtesy? In my country (I am from an European country) it's actually normal to bring dessert or wine at any dinner, BBQ or lunch you are invited to. The host is spending money and effort, I feel like it's the bare minimum to bring something... I would say it's not a cultural thing, bc I have friends from all around the world and we always bring side dishes, dessert, beer or wine to any event we are invited to.\nTbh, if you come empty handed, you are kinda regarded as an AH", "It's weird because I'm an Aussie and I never rock up empty handed, across different parts of the country too. \n\nIt's really common to have everyone bring something, and to co-ordinate. I've been in group chats where organiser has listed out things and people are like \"dibs side #2\" \"I'll take dessert #1\"\n\nMaybe OPs bf is super rich or something but friends who grew up in Toorak (rich people suburb) were part of the above so I don't know", "Same here. I would state it in the invitation, pot lucks are lovely when everyone is in on it. I had an ex sister in law that did this alot. Invited people over, they accepted and was later told to bring stuff when it would look rude and moochy to back out. The problem was that at the time me and my ex husband + two other households had exactly no extra money to spend on her parties, but would end up having to, for her not to get mad and start a fight.\n\nBut if it is a cultural thing, everyone just knows even if its not spoken.", "Drooling over your steak butter.

Generally I found the host supplies sides, desserts, nibbles. The guests bring things to throw on the BBQ. \n\nSo not weird to ask guests to bring something to a BBQ.", "Aussie here, too, and for us, it depends on BBQ vs. Roast dinner. \n\nFor BBQ, we normally do, host supplies, meat, and guests bring sides (we all have our go-to dishes for sides). We also supply our own drinks (but fridge and booze raiding is allowed on the condition of you finish a bottle of alcohol, you replace) and can bring extra meat if we want.\n\nFor roast night, the host supplies everything except drinks with the same rule as above. (Desserts are discussed before hand)\n\nI say NTA. However, the main deciding factor on whether or not it is tacky is the dynamic between the couples involved.\n\nETA unless I'm going to my aunts, if she is hosting and  you bring something without prior approval, you're in trouble but she's a kiwi so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm Australian, this is pretty standard. Sure, some people like to show off and provide all drinks (alcohol, non-alcoholic) and all food; but it's also pretty standard to have \"bring a plate\". And it doesn't have to be just a BBQ. It could be that some people bring entrees, others, bring main dishes, others bring sides, and other bring desserts. No cooking done on sight; maybe reheat if at someone's house but you don't have that luxury if it's in a park somewhere. This is actually a lot of fun and I miss these sorts of things.", "I read that as 'meat to throw up on' and was like jeeze, that's a special subset of the UK \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48", "\u2026 why was the info about you being a professional footballer relevant to this dialogue? Does that mean you\u2019re more qualified to have an opinion?", "Lots better to bring your own meat than to be one of those posts by a vegan/vegetarian who complains LOUDLY and maybe storms out when all they can eat is sides.  Bring your own dang impossible burger or something, AND sides that they can eat.\n\nIt's very common to have a pot luck BBQ and bring a side or drinks.  The other way is the host provides all the sides and bring your own meat.", "I don't knownif it's because I grew up in the south, but the idea of showing up to someone's house empty handed stresses me out.

Even if I'm just going over to my sister's for a casual hang, I always ask what to get from the shops on the way.

He set his sites and achieved it. Because of this he is comfortably well off (not a millionaire or anything) and he had a particular group of social friends and a particular group of networking friends. He showed off to the networking friends because that's what he had to do; with the social friends he was very down-to-earth, very supportive, and was happy eating at low key restaurants. One thing he was always insistent on, though, was when he hosted parties he hosted the party. He didn't like the idea of \"bring a plate\" or BYO alcohol. He supplied everything - amazing quality food, expensive wines and champagnes. He invited both the social group of friends and the networking group of friends. These were the only times the two groups mixed but the two groups did get to know each other and remembered each other from one party to the next. There were some I wouldn't choose to be in my circle on a day-to-day basis but we were all happy to socialise at these events ad got along well. There was no real social class divide. My parents were also invited to oe of these parties the they were visiting me.
