Am Aussie, and this is really really common across all(most?) demographics- especially drinks. You are hosting and will be providing a taste sensation of a main- and some of the drinks- so you are doing more than enough. If husbo isn\u2019t happy then he can pull his finger out and do it all.\n\nIMO/experience, being able to bring something to a gathering makes it feel more communal and less of an imposition on the host- especially if they crack out the good table wear and handle all the cleanup.", "no\u2026 bringing food to a bbq is just an unspoken rule", " I\u2019m Anglo Aussie and asking someone politely to bring a plate of something is quite normal - if your host doesn\u2019t ask, then it\u2019s polite to ask them if they want you to bring something. \n\nThe only exception to this that I can think of off hand is in some cultures (Mediterranean ones spring to mind here, but also south east Asia) where its almost seen as a dereliction of duty if the host doesn\u2019t over cater and make enough food for a small village as a show of their generosity and hospitality.  Not better, not worse, just different. \n\nIf your DH is from a non-Anglo background, I can see why it would seem rude to ask guests to bring something, because that\u2019s not generally a done thing in those cultures.", "German here. Unless specified when going to a bbq ypu bring your own meat and the sides are mostly shared.", "BYO meat sems to work well for some groups if you've got particular requirements. E.g. a couple Jewish, a couple vegetarian or vegan, and then people can just get what works for them", "Maybe I\u2019m showing my age here, but when we had BBQs when I was a kid in Oz the request was usually \u2018bring a plate\u2019.", "We are one of the few friends in our group with a garden. When it's a good forecast on the weekend (we live in Scotland, you gotta jump on those sunny days) we do an open invite, do a bunch of food and tell people to bring anything else they want. My partner is vegetarian so that includes bringing your meat. Without fail we end up with so much food because everyone has their special salad recipe they just loving sharing with others. If I go to a BBQ I have a potato salad I always make. It's just common courtesy and no one finds this strange.", "yeah pretty standard to bring something to such a large gathering. usually the host brings the main meats and starch whatever and everyone else brings a side or beer and it\u2019s fine to ask ahead of time to help coordinate so there aren\u2019t duplicates", ">\nI am planning on smoking a brisket (or ribs depending on timing)/ chicken wings/brats and hotdogs for kids - spending about $200 including some beer and non-alcoholic drinks for 25/30 people.\n\nYou are providing *lots* of food and drink yourself, and that is a pretty big party. Unless your husband wants to be the one making all the sides (and paying for them), then by all means ask your guests to bring a plate. \n\nI'm an Aussie and I would have asked as soon as you invited me what you needed me to bring. \nHell, there was even an ad by Cadbury in Australia about the social pressure of going to a BBQ, even if you're told not to bring a thing. This is not a cultural thing.", "If you're married to a New Zealander and have Aussie friends then you know you're wrong. Why you like being wrong on this? I have no idea.", "> We were all told b.y.o m&g... meat and grog. \n\nBeen to a few in NZ like that - host often provides salads, breads, chips & dips, soft drinks, etc. along with the flame.", "Yep. Most un-Australian Australian thing I've ever heard - talking about trashy and low class and not asking people to bring stuff to a BBQ. OP - You sure you're husband is from Australia?? NTA", "Also an Aussie, it depends on the group on what we will bring (most often alcohol to share) but it\u2019s not weird to ask people to bring things while still being prepared if not many people do. Also, pretty normal for guests to ask \u201cHey, what would be a good desert or something to bring?\u201d \n\nNTA", "Yeah exactly this! It's fine to ask, mostly people will contribute, sometimes people can't and that's cool too.", "As an Aussie, I second this.", "As an Aussie born of wog descent, I did baulk the first time I was invited to a BBQ and told to byo meat, but salads were provided.\n\nBut yes it's totally the norm to bring a side/salad/dessert", "It's hilarious that you think an American in this situation is close-minded, but any Brits or Australians who are offended are not...", "Australian culture is different from British/english culture, there may be similarities but they're still different. Leave the judging of whether this is in line with Australian culture to us aussies.", "Good thing this person clarified they\u2019re answering from the perspective of an American then\u2026", "this sounds nice.", "That\u2019s still a thing.", "The minimum is a couple big bags of potato chips", "Maybe he grew up fairly wealthy, and guests brought booze for the host and never sides?", "Yep", "This!", "I'm bored with traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas fare for dinners.\n\nWe're considering going to 'bring a harvest festival/ seasonal dish from a foreign country you have literally any connection at all to, and we'll guess' for Thanksgiving and 'Pick a traditional Christmas dish from another country' for Christmas and same deal.\n\nNew foods, interesting dinner parties. \n\nBit done with ham and green bean casserole for every single Christmas.\n\nInternational potlucks sound like fun. About to start doing them for kicks.", "Please don't listen to them. It's bad manners to show up empty-handed to a BBQ in the US (and Australia judging from other posts).", "Not this one.. only provided the actual bbq", "Bring a plate is also a well known NZ thing", "But\u2026 are you a professional football player in Britain? Apparently they have different rules \ud83d\ude44", "Also, for context, it was an American and Aussie having a conversation so another American chimed in that it was normal for Americans.\n\nIt was 100% relevant.\n\nAlso, a bunch of Brits and Aussies are saying bringing a dish (or plate) is normal there, as well.", "I enjoyed the irony of him as an American criticizing other Americans for being presumptuous about other cultures while doing the exact same thing himself. I lived in Sydney for a few years but I would never speak for Australians, especially not while criticizing others for doing the same thing.", "The thing you bring when you're told not to bring a thing.", "I guess if everyone is onboard with it that's cool too. :)", "Yeah, and the plate is supposed to have stuff on it too - trap for young players / recent arrivals to NZ. :)"]}
