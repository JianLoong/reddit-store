One might cater say, for example, 2 sausages and one burger pattie per person and then add some extra for just in case. Not all the meat would go onto the BBQ at once (mainly due to space restriction) and so, the person doing the cooking on  BBQ would keep an eye on how things are progressing. If it looks like people are consuming more meats, then extra would be taken out of the fridge (not the freezer); if it looks like everyone has satisfied their hunger, the meats would remain in the fridge. This has happened to me when having a BBQ in a park but fortunately I had a Eskis filled with ice and could keep the meats safely cool.\n\nFor situations of BYO meats, as soon as you turn up, you throw the meat onto the BBQ (if there's room, otherwise just wait) and then keep an eye on it yourself. The BBQ becomes the water cooler for social interaction. This way each individual group (e.g. family of 4) can estimate how much meat they want and usually there's less left over. People might also swap meats or share because they've brought too much. It becomes very sociable.\n\nNoting: suckling pig, smokers etc weren't a common historical thing in Australia.

Etiquette classes were a requirement in early high school for us to attended winter formal. As an adult I\u2019ve definitely been invited to parties that were catered and it wasn\u2019t appropriate or needed to bring food, but I always felt more pressure to choose an appropriate hostess gift than when just bringing food.

I know when I'm a host, I encourage guests to take a plate of mixed food home and I STILL end up with a LOT of leftovers and basically don't have to cook for three or four days afterwards.  It's a pretty good system, used it all my life.", "We live in Ohio (USA). \n\nMy son-in-law IS a cook in a pretty popular local restaurant. \n\nHe prepares the evening meal before going in for the dinner shift. All my daughter has to do is heat it up. \n\nBu, my grandson always tells his friends on the bus what he's having for dinner that night, and their moms text her to ask if they can send their kid over with a tupperware container. \n\nThey have 1 kid and my son-in-law has to cook enough for 12-14.\n\nLOL...it's sort of become a neighborhood joke.", "This is wild.\n\nWhat other ways are the swedes weird?   \n\n\"For a neutral country they seem kind of tense\"", "Don\u2019t you give the kid dinner too lol?", "For real? they would invite a child, exclude them from the meal, and everyone would be ok with that? What if the kid is hungry? Would they say no if the kid asked for food?", "I was born in 80's Australia and everytime I've been to a Barbie (which was has been a lot) everyone brought something e.g. meat, salad, beer etc\n\nMaybe it's a family/party size thing? All the parties I went to were huge because my family started with a Catholic immigrant family of nine and it exploded from there \ud83e\udd23", "Thats crazy but your sil sounds like a good person I wish I knew someone like that growing up those kids probably appreciate it so much", "What a bunch of deadbeats. Can't feed their own families and are making a poor working man bust his ass for them.", "I think you shouldn't have mentioned how much you're spending on the food, that's tacky but asking to bring a side is ok.", "Yeah, most places it's normal to either bring a side / dessert or some extra beer when going to a BBQ.\n\nIt's like bringing a bottle of wine to a dinner party.", "Also you didn't really ask for a side you just said they should bring one of they want one", "Ok..im american and dont see anything wrong with this....was hoping an aussie would comment to see if this was a cultural clash or just his personal views..so thanks for the comment!", "Doesn't sound like he doesn't like it because it is not a cultural norm, he seems to have some classist issue and feels it makes them look poor", "> Can\u2019t tell if r/ShitAmericansSay or r/USdefaultism.\n\nMaybe not, but I can spot an r/shutupbrayden/ with perfect clarity.", "I mean, as a professional footballer, he would surely be an etiquette expert!", "In the UK its more of we'll supply the food you bring the booze.", "TYVM, I thought snacks", "Midwesterner here, and same. Dessert alone is 6 kinds of bars, nevermind pie and whatever else people bring. Don't get me started on the 8 kinds of potato salad lol", "Same here! Even if it's just a six-pack to throw in the cooler and a big bag of chips. I was raised to never show up to someone's door bringing just your appetite.", "I remember to have a fight with a cousin because he had a big debt with my dad and also usually came to lunch/dinners to stay and expected to be served by the women, every day on summers. And obviously he never  brought a beverage or ice-cream to share (most common and most cheap here).\n\nThe yelling was motivated for all the above but the words mostly were about how rude was to come to lunch and never ever bring anything (he was employed and like 45 yo at the time, btw).\n\nNo one on the family could actually believe how rude and entitled he was. That is the force on the cultural norm here, not to follow through is very embarrasing too.", "And I also think that with many people having food or diet restrictions, it is much easier for them to bring something they like/can eat than for the hosts to have to try an accommodate, especially with so many people attending.", "I mean, even the poor kid brings a bag of chips or a box of cookies.\n\nBut seriously, every BBQ, Grill out, or picnic I've been to has had every group bring something to share be it soda, sides, booze, condiments, dessert or even the paper plates and utensils.\n\nThe only exceptions are when the host makes it clear it's all inclusive or its catered.", "Ah yes, the \"oops we have four potato salads from the same store and six pasta salads\" conundrum.", "Exactly this! Even when we go to mine and my boyfriend\u2019s families houses for holidays, gatherings, parties, I always bring something because I hate showing up empty handed.", "That's if you're Canadian.", "My bet is that he's from Canberra. I've run into this attitude quite a lot", "Note to self: Place fork and knife on plate when invited to a \"bring a plate\" get together\n\njk", "BYOB, bring your own booze.", "I can see how it could be harder if ND, but I'm sure the wording has confused any number of people unfamiliar with the cultural context and usage. About 25% of New Zealanders where born elsewhere; it's an oft repeated story that the BBQ/Potluck invite included the \"new neighbours\" and they arrived with *plates*. :)\n\nI have a bad habit of going the other way - when told that I *don't* need to bring anything I will still get chips/crisps and soft drinks and things like that. If they don't get used that's fine, but they're usually gone by the end of the evening.", "Yeah, I grew up in the Midwest, and usually, they're a potluck affair. My parents' friends would have 2 or 3 BBQs per summer every year, where the host would take care of the meat and guests would bring everything else. Someday, I will figure out that Best Mac and Cheese In The World\u2122 recipe that would show up; it was a religious experience for most people that tried it.", "This seems pretty mooche-y.\n\nDo they do anything to compensate for that? I cannot imagine myself doing this.", "A Swedish friend said he never thought about it, but always played in his friends\u2019 rooms or went home and had his own dinner during meal time. Generally, the kids live in the same neighborhood and are of the same class, so there is no concern about letting a child go hungry. It\u2019s more that meals are a family time. My friend says trouble arises when an immigrant family feeds a child guest as a matter of hospitality but then the guest\u2019s family never reciprocates."]}
