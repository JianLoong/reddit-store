I've always liked Kim for Tom, she's supportive of him and kind, and she really appreciates and adores him, I'm very happy for them. I've always found Kim a little excitable (?) for my taste but I'm well aware my taste is irrelevant and I don't see Kim that often as I'm a mom to a young child and I live abroad half the year.\n\nWith this context, I was very surprised to arrive home from a trip to find a package from Kim containing a \"bridesmaid proposal\" (is that what they're called?) kit and a handwritten letter from Kim asking me to be one of her bridesmaids. I planned to give her a call within a couple of days to let her know I wouldn't be able to do it, citing a busy schedule and the demands of a toddler. Unfortunately, my husband had a medical emergency the next day and I had to deal with an ungodly amount of admin for the next few days, and it slipped my mind until I was on my way to Tom and Kim's engagement cocktail party at my parents' house.\n\nI wasn't going to say anything about it to Kim that night, but the second I got there she said she was dying to introduce me to the other bridesmaids, and honestly meeting them and hearing about all the activities further cemented my decision. I pulled Kim aside and told her that I wouldn't be able to be a bridesmaid. She snapped, asking why, at which point I calmly told her that while I don't have to explain myself and didn't appreciate her not respecting my answer, I didn't have time to take part in the activities or dedicate any time to planning or helping her. Kim tried to argue it with me, which drew the attention of some of her friends, so they were now listening in, and I again explained to her that I couldn't do it. Kim then snapped that that's just an excuse, and I can make time for things when I want to (referring to the fact that an employee of my husband got married last year and I planned and hosted their wedding) for my friends. At which point I said 'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'. Something snapped and Kim began bawling, her intoxicated friends started swearing at me...it was a long night.\n\nThere is no consensus on whether or not I'm the AH for not doing it, responses range from whatever Kim's friends were saying, to \"Why did she even ask you\" to everything in between. Tom still wants me to change my mind because he says it would make his life easier but says he won't hold it against me for not taking on the burden, and his opinion is obviously the most important here. It's not that I am holding out just to make his life complicated, I just really don't feel that I can do this and even if I could, I really don't want to.

I want to be there for you during the wedding days leading up but I don't think I can commit to bachelorette's and planning beyond that*\".", "NTA, it was harsh tonpoint out your not friends but you wouldn't have had to if she respected your answer.", "YTA\nif you just explained why, this drama could have all be avoided. Especially since she's marrying into your family.\n\n\nEspecially since alot of time had passed to telling her no.", "NTA: OP, Kim was doing here level best to guilt and manipulate you. You are completely correct; she is not a friend. A friend would understand! You have no need to devote your time and money to an endless well of narcissistic demands.", "NTA - people are supposed to do these \"bridesmaid proposals\" (which I don't love for separate reasons but I digress) with the purpose of letting you say yes OR no. It's a request, and one that you had great reasons to refuse. The bride sounds unreasonable, and you dodged a bullet. \n\nMaybe I wouldn't have had the fight about whether you two are friends or not at her engagement party, but you're within your right to decline, and she made an assumption that placed her in an uncomfortable position. It's ultimately on her.", "YTA. You clearly mean a lot to Kim, and she wants you to be a part of her big day. \n\nDo you realize that all you *have* to do as a member of the wedding party is stand next to them at the wedding and take some extra pictures? I\u2019m sure most people would be very understanding if you said \u201cyes, I\u2019d love to be a bridesmaid but I don\u2019t think I can commit to any events outside of the wedding\u201d. If that\u2019s not okay with her, then you can go ahead and back out completely. Instead, you went scorched earth, and there\u2019s not really any going back.\n\n> I don\u2019t have to explain myself\n\nYou said no to something that was clearly a big deal to Kim, it\u2019s basic human decency to explain why.\n\n> you and I are not friends\n\nWhat an AH thing to say, especially to someone who\u2019s going to be a part of *the rest of your life*.", "NTA\n\nYou probably should have discussed this sooner, but your reasons are solid and no one can force you into this.  You were being accosted and questioned on something that the answer NO should be sufficient.  Again, maybe engaging with her was necessary since it seems she and her friends were drinking and NOTHING good comes from those types of arguments.  If she is going to be part of the family, though, you ought to see if there is some future common ground to build on and ease the \"I'm not your friend\" zinger which may be true, but harsh.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but it's on Kim to confirm the plans. You have no obligation to go, and don't need any explanation.\n\nIf you're giving her an explanation though; turning to someone who's clearly stressed and upset and saying 'you and I are not friends' isn't a nice or clever thing to do.", "One week had passed. One week where I was parenting a toddler in a hospital room and playing secretary to a company I don\u2019t work for as well as worrying if my husband was going to have all his organs from one day to the next. Sorry, Kim was not on my mind.\n\nETA: I did explain my reasons to her, she just decided she didn\u2019t agree with them."]}
