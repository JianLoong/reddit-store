I want to be there for you during the wedding days leading up but I don't think I can commit to bachelorette's and planning beyond that*\".", "NTA, it was harsh tonpoint out your not friends but you wouldn't have had to if she respected your answer.", "YTA\nif you just explained why, this drama could have all be avoided. Especially since she's marrying into your family.\n\n\nEspecially since alot of time had passed to telling her no.", "NTA: OP, Kim was doing here level best to guilt and manipulate you. You are completely correct; she is not a friend. A friend would understand! You have no need to devote your time and money to an endless well of narcissistic demands.", "NTA - people are supposed to do these \"bridesmaid proposals\" (which I don't love for separate reasons but I digress) with the purpose of letting you say yes OR no. It's a request, and one that you had great reasons to refuse. The bride sounds unreasonable, and you dodged a bullet. \n\nMaybe I wouldn't have had the fight about whether you two are friends or not at her engagement party, but you're within your right to decline, and she made an assumption that placed her in an uncomfortable position. It's ultimately on her.", "YTA. You clearly mean a lot to Kim, and she wants you to be a part of her big day. \n\nDo you realize that all you *have* to do as a member of the wedding party is stand next to them at the wedding and take some extra pictures? I\u2019m sure most people would be very understanding if you said \u201cyes, I\u2019d love to be a bridesmaid but I don\u2019t think I can commit to any events outside of the wedding\u201d. If that\u2019s not okay with her, then you can go ahead and back out completely. Instead, you went scorched earth, and there\u2019s not really any going back.\n\n> I don\u2019t have to explain myself\n\nYou said no to something that was clearly a big deal to Kim, it\u2019s basic human decency to explain why.\n\n> you and I are not friends\n\nWhat an AH thing to say, especially to someone who\u2019s going to be a part of *the rest of your life*.", "NTA\n\nYou probably should have discussed this sooner, but your reasons are solid and no one can force you into this.  You were being accosted and questioned on something that the answer NO should be sufficient.  Again, maybe engaging with her was necessary since it seems she and her friends were drinking and NOTHING good comes from those types of arguments.  If she is going to be part of the family, though, you ought to see if there is some future common ground to build on and ease the \"I'm not your friend\" zinger which may be true, but harsh.", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but it's on Kim to confirm the plans. You have no obligation to go, and don't need any explanation.\n\nIf you're giving her an explanation though; turning to someone who's clearly stressed and upset and saying 'you and I are not friends' isn't a nice or clever thing to do.", "One week had passed. One week where I was parenting a toddler in a hospital room and playing secretary to a company I don\u2019t work for as well as worrying if my husband was going to have all his organs from one day to the next. Sorry, Kim was not on my mind.\n\nETA: I did explain my reasons to her, she just decided she didn\u2019t agree with them.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. It probably should\u2019ve been a priority to tell her as soon as you received the proposal and saying \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend\u201d was pretty rude if she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong to you. She also shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you and should\u2019ve accepted your choice like an adult when you told her, though.", "ESH\n\nYou are an asshole because you choose the engagement party to tell her no. You should have waited and had a phone call with her and your brother to explain why you can't be a bridesmaid. Also telling her you are not her friend was a bit petty imo.  She is about to be part of your family and is an important person to your brother. \n\nShe is the asshole because she should have gracefully accepted your decline. But I would imagine that maybe getting that news at their engagement party in front of family and friends may have also contributed to the hysterics.", "You clearly need to learn how to better utilize your kid as an excuse to get out of doing stuff. \n\nBut for real, why didn't you just tell her that you were sorry for taking so long to do so but were unable to help out after dealing with the family emergency, young child, etc.\n\nShe was rude to demand a reason, but I would have tried being civil before taking the nuclear option.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t have to be so rude. Even white lies about why you couldn\u2019t do it would have been fine", "You are N T A for not wanting to be a bridesmaid, but your delivery was bad. Just say you're now too busy. ESH", ">referring to the fact that an employee of my husband got married last year and I planned and hosted their wedding\n\nInfo: That does sound like something that took a lot of time. So is your reason really that you don't have the time to be a bridesmaid? If you tried to talk to her about it first, and told her that you could be a bridesmaid only if you were a \"part-time\" bridesmaid, as in you wouldn't necessarily go to all the bridesmaid activities, but you would be part of the wedding party on the day of, would she have said no to that compromise? Or did you not want to do it even if that was the circumstance? Because reading through this post, it does kind of sound like you don't like her, beyond just a she's not your style kind of thing. And even if you don't see her all the time, she is going to be part of your family now, and now you've created a really awkward relationship for you two. At the very least you could've handled your response to her better.", "ESH I 100% get where you\u2019re coming from, but you should\u2019ve told her right away.", "ESH.  All you had to say was \"While I'm honored that you asked, it is not something I will be able to do.\"  But instead, you got on your high horse with the \"I don't have to explain myself to you\" remark.  And the \"you and I aren't friends\" was just plain mean.\n\nKim is also TA because she wouldn't accept you declining and sent her flying monkeys to harass you.\n\nBoth of you are unpleasant people.", "ESH while no is a complete sentence and no one is entitled to the reasoning behind your choices, it's normally an asshole move in situations like this to not give a reason. I'm also not sure why you couldn't have taken 30 seconds in the days/weeks before her engagement party to shoot your SIL a text letting her know that you appreciate the offer but won't be able to be a bridesmaid.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, her and her friends are assholes for their extreme reaction and behavior. You're not an asshole for saying no, you're an asshole for your attitude and choices regarding how you handled this situation.", "ESH. I feel like Kim should\u2019ve been more understanding but you definitely could\u2019ve handled it differently. She obviously think highly of you and wants be to on good terms with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister. Maybe come to some agreement that you\u2019ll be her brides mate but due to a busy schedule you sadly won\u2019t be able to plan the bachelorette or engagement party, but you\u2019ll stand by her side and support her on the wedding day.", "YTA.  I think someone being flatly told \u2018no\u2019 to the request of \u2018will you stand up for me and your brother at our wedding\u2019 it\u2019d be kind of common to immediately just ask the knee-jerk question of \u2018why\u2019?   For you to \u2018calmly\u2019 reply that you don\u2019t owe her an explanation and she needs to respect your answer would be something I might answer passive aggressively to a coworker I generally and genuinely dislike asking me to contribute to their neighbors gofundme, and someone I also don\u2019t care how I come off towards.   \n\nYou cement that impression by explaining very helpfully that you don\u2019t consider her a friend\u2026at all.", "ESH. It seems to me like you don't even like her, and any time someone describes themselves as \"calmly explaining\" things to others, my AH flags go off. You're so calm and logical, and everyone else is not. The engagement party was not the right place to tell her the news, and DEFINITELY not the place to tell her she's not your friend.", "YTA because of your delivery: \"I don't need to explain my reasoning to you.\" Alright, like, yes we know No is a complete sentence, but this is your sister-in-law and that's just an asshole approach to an otherwise really happy time for people. \n\n\"You and I are not friends\" therefore, I will not be making time in my life for you. Like, come on. You could have just said your life is much busier now than it was when you helped with an employee of your husband's wedding (which is a bit much and I understand your SIL here- it's not like you described it as helping with a *friend's* wedding last year) \n\nAnd then just your general attitude towards SIL and your sneering at her personality and activities planned. Jeez, get off your high horse. People say no to being bridesmaids all the time because of the financial and time commitments. You should have just approached it in that manner instead of demeaning her.", "YTA you forgot to tell her no and then remembered in time to ruin her engagement party.  In such a cold, nasty way. That's what makes you a huge AH. Not because you didn't want to be a bridesmaids.", "YTA, your We\u2019re not friends probably broke her heart in addition to ruining her party. \nWhy do you talk to your future SIL like it\u2019s HR?\nShe seems like she\u2019s really making an effort to build a relationship with you, but it doesn\u2019t seem to mean anything to you.", "INFO: Did Kim know that your husband was in the hospital?", "YTA. You treated this like your boss asking you to do something out of your scope. This is your brother's wife trying to become more integrated in your family and be friendly with you. Did you even talk with your brother about this? Maybe he was the one who asked his fiance to invite you to be a bridesmaid. And you completely ignored the request (how long was it between the request and the party? Weeks??), and was extremely rude to her at her ENGAGEMENT party about the whole thing after you ghosted and never responded to her, and then pointedly told her how little you care about her at all. Damn dude, I don't think you could get any colder. You say you like her and she's good for your brother, but you can't even pretend to be friendly though, huh? The real question should be \"aita for how poorly I treated my brothers fiance at her engagement party?\". I was originally going to say ESH because sure, if you can't commit then be honest and she needs to accept that, but after thinking about it, you just did this all wrong. Poor girl.", "NTA you tried to politely tell her no and she wouldn\u2019t accept that answer. Your delivery wasn\u2019t great, but she was the rude one here and created the issue.", "YTA.", "YTA. You should have given her a heads up, so you wouldn't have caught her off guard at her engagement party. Also, saying you won't be a bridesmaid because you're not friends, (which to her makes it clear that you don't like her) is a super shitty thing to do. You should've leaned harder into your busy working mom excuse. Or just sucked it up and been a bridesmaid. Realistically, if you had time to plan another friends wedding, you can handle the minimal responsibility of being a bridesmaid in your brothers wedding imo. By your own admission, you just don't like her so you don't want to. So clearly, that's bound to cause some unnecessary strife.", "YTA,  \n\n\nI think you could learn to be more tactful and less brutally honest. That wasn't the time or place as you mentioned.", "YTA. If you gave half a shit, you'd have told her from the beginning. But she doesn't mean anything to you, and that's exactly how you treated her.", "YTA", "ESH, both of you could have handled this better. You could have not put it off and she could have respected your wishes.", "ESH\n\nYour not an asshole for not wanting to be a part of her wedding\n\nHOWEVER...you should have pulled her aside and told her \"I would like to have a discussion with you about this but I need to tell you that I can not commit to being your bridesmaid.  Lets enjoy the party and we can talk about this later...but now is not the time and place for that discussion.\"\n\nAnd if she continued to hound you, you simply tell your husband you are leaving and that he needs to uber home\n\nInstead...you allowed yourself to feel as if she was personally attacking you, things escalated, and you said something you can't take back and that will ultimately...prevent you from being able to be in the same room as her from now on without drama or tension\n\nAnd yes, she was an ahole for confronting you.  But you didn't need to fire back.\n\nSometimes you gotta know when to walk away", "ESH. she shouldn\u2019t have snapped like that but you handled that really poorly. it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re not friends, you\u2019re future family. you were rude af. and yeah, if you planned and hosted an entire wedding but won\u2019t be a bridesmaid because of a busy schedule, that wouldn\u2019t make sense to me either. you could be a bridesmaid and just not participate in a lot of activities. compromises could have been made.", "She'll remember this forever.", "I was with you until the \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d comment. \n\nBut I still say NTA. Kim got an answer, she didn\u2019t like it, she continued to push you to do it, so you snapped.\n\nYou don\u2019t *owe* anyone your time and efforts. You decided you don\u2019t want to do it. Why did she think she could force you to ?", "YTA for waiting until you were there to tell her. \n\nIf you had time to get ready to attend the party, you had time to send a 2 minute text declining and explaining why.  Like even if the week prior was intense, you obv were able to attend. \n\nNTA for not wanting to - that's up to you.", "NTA. Based on the info you provided in a reply, Kim was the last thing to worry about. Crap happens, she will be fine. It\u2019s an invite, not a summons. You don\u2019t HAVE to do anything regardless of if someone wants you to or not. Heck, you live abroad half the time anyways, right?! She expect you to just jet on over at her whims? Sorry but girls like Kim irritate TF outta me.\n\nAnd FWIW, I think telling Kim you aren\u2019t friends is just fine honestly. You\u2019re not. Why lie? I mean, maybe the timing was off but she was pushing too hard and something was bound to happen. She will get over it.", "NTA. she asked you, you said no. you have the rights to refuse as much as she has the rights to ask you. she could not push you to do what you dont wanna do.", "ESH", "Esh. Why couldn\u2019t have told her you\u2019re actual reasons instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t need an excuse\u201d. No one needs an excuse to say no, but it\u2019s nice to add context and not say \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d", "ESH. You have every right to say no, and she should've just accepted your decision graciously ,but to say to her \"yes, but Kim you and aren't friends\" in front of everyone is frankly Just RUDE.", "NTA. She sounds insufferable.", "YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE!!!!  Telling your future SISTER IN LAW during her ENGAGEMENT PARTY that you are not friends???  JFC, the absolute lack of awareness!  If I were her I'd be mortified that you acted so classless in front of friends, not on her behalf, but on yours.  If I were one of her friends I would feel awful that she had to deal with you, honestly.  You sound super self absorbed, and like you think you are too good for your enthusiastic, loving sister in law.  Life is short, and one day you may find yourself wishing you didn't act like you were too good and important for your own family.", "ESH. I understand you\u2019re busy, but you could squeeze a short phone call in to let her know. She shouldn\u2019t have been so emotional, but you were pretty rude. This woman is going to be at your family events for the rest of your days.", "ESH but more you for taking a whole week to tell her you're not going to be in her wedding party. Doing it at the engagement party was low", "NTA for not wanting to be a bridesmaid, but jesus - you sound like a fairly shitty person. \n\n>'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'.\n\nWTF was that? Do you feel cool about being super cold to people or something? I bet you slap yourself on the back for that one liner. \n\nBest of luck with the whole family thing.", "ESH, this mostly could have been avoided by a simple text. You waited until their engagement party when she was introducing you to bridesmaids to tell her, at any point in the week you could have dropped her a quick text saying \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but I can\u2019t accept, I really don\u2019t have the time with everything going on. I\u2019ll explain further at the party\u201d. You also sound pretty rude with \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain myself\u201d after you dropped this on her at her engagement party. Telling her \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d is the icing on the cake and just ensures your relationship with your husbands family will be affected by this.  She should have dropped it once it was made clear you don\u2019t want to do it but I understand why she snapped, telling her at the engagement party after she\u2019s introduced you to bridesmaids is setting her up for quite an embarrassing moment. When she snapped back what?! why?! she obviously taken aback by your rejection and you respond with rudeness I\u2019m not surprised it blew up. \n\nI do kinda think the bottom line is here that you don\u2019t really like her and do not care enough about her to try. Why are you upset about the \u201cwhy did she ask anyway?\u201d Comment? If you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re not friends, it\u2019s a valid question. She\u2019s hurt because she thought you were closer than that, that the wedding would bring you even closer and with your rejection this just kinda cemented that you don\u2019t want to have that relationship. It will affect things going forward, she likely won\u2019t want a friendship with you and it may end up causing tension down the line.", "NTA\n\nWhile the \"you and I are not't friends\" line was harsh it was only in response to her refusing to accept your no for an answer. \nYou have a lot going on with your family and work but even if you didn't no is full sentence.", "Yep. Stone cold. I pity anyone in your life.", "ESH\n\nTo be honest the timing was pretty bad and you didn't have to mention the \"not friends\" part, but I understand why you wouldn't want to do it. It's a lot of activities for a young mom and you two aren't even close.\n\nIt's your delivery that makes you the asshole. This should've been handled days earlier in a more gentle way. Sounds like Kim was trying to bond with you and since you two are going to be family soon you could've put more focus on the busy schedule and caring for a baby.\n\nKim sucks for her reaction, but I suspect alcohol played a part in it. She also didn't wait for you to confirm and assumed you'll do it.", "NTA. Your husbands medical emergency precluded you telling her no right away. She cornered you at the party and wouldn't take your no as an answer. You aren't close with her, you don't want to do it, and even if you did, you are obviously too busy. She should have called you first to ask. The bridesmaid proposal idea is cute, but presumptive. It seems more like she voluntold you. If she were asking then she should have been prepared for a no.", "NAH\n\nSounds like Kim was either under the impression you two are friends OR was hoping/imagining you two would become friends - possibly sisters - now she's formally joining the family. Does Kim have sisters? You mentioned her other bridesmaids were her friends, and she was very excited about introducing you to each other.\n\nWhereas you see Kim as your brother's partner. You are happy she is good for your brother but you wouldn't associate with her if they weren't together. Unfortunately these differing understandings of what your relationship is and will become came out at the engagement party when people had been drinking. I don't think Kim's an AH for her hurt and/or disappointed and I don't think you're an AH for wanting to attend the wedding as a guest. Hopefully Kim will be able to adjust her expectations and you all can move on.", "ESH. \n\nShe should have accepted you declining, but you waited to tell her at her engagement party and made the point of saying she\u2019s not your friend. I get you were frustrated having to explain yourself but your whole manner and approach was just mean. So YTA more here. \n\nFrom the outset you \u2018calmly tell her you don\u2019t have to explain yourself\u2019\u2026 I mean you could have just apologised and said something like \u2018it\u2019s really kind of you to consider me but I\u2019m really busy in this period especially with a toddler\u2019.

Rejecting her at her own engagement party right after she\u2019s introduced bridesmaids and all sat there talking about plans is going to likely have the reaction you got. Not telling her before the party is what\u2019s amplified the issue.", "Ohhh got it. I mean, it clearly came across as combative, I really didn\u2019t mean it like \u201cI hate you you deserve to be pelted with rotting fruit\u201d, it was more because she was comparing two different situations and deciding they were the same. But yes, probably could have tried some other way to say it.", "How was it rude? It is a statement of fact. My sister is married and her husband and I are not friends at all. There is no iota of friendship between us. He knows I'm not his friend and I want nothing to do with him, and the feeling is reciprocated. Some people will just never be friends and that's acceptable. Just because someone is marrying into the family doesn't make them family.", "I said \u201cKim it was kind of you to ask me to be a bridesmaid, but I won\u2019t be able to do it\u201d. She then snapped (and I do mean actually snapped) \u201cwell why not?\u201d", "Yeah, the \"I don't have to explain to you\" is like - maybe Kim wanted to know why so that she could try and accommodate  OP, but OP was just like \"nope, absolutely not\" about the whole thing. Especially since asking a future SiL doesn't read weird to me, it just reads like formally including the family in the wedding party.", "Yes, agreed. Op can be right and an AH, or she could have be polite and graceful about it.", "I thought no was a full sentence and suddenly it\u2019s not?", "Literally none of the examples being given are a universal requirement for bridesmaids. My point is that OP could have asked what the expected commitment level would have been before rejecting the offer.", "Just to clarify, the assumptions are correct. I mentioned briefly in the post about her friends talking about activities. There were at least five whole day/overnight activities planned, on top of any ad hoc planning that one is expected to help out with as a bridesmaid. I saw this coming from all the monogrammed items in the package. \n\nFair enough if you think I should have handled it differently etc. but they\u2019re absolutely correct about there being expectations of a time commitment.", ">OP was asked in an elaborate way (which is the norm nowadays) to be a bridesmaid\n\nThis isn't done where I live, and I imagine it would make it much more difficult to say no. Especially when the advice to brides (thanks Google) is that if you buy someone a great gift and make them feel special, they'll definitely say yes.\n\nSeems like you should at least get a *sense* of whether someone is willing before you send them monogrammed towels or invite them to a \"be my bridesmaid\" lunch or whatever it is.", "Yeah, it was unfortunate. My brain got scrambled spending most of the week in the hospital, and then it seemed really disingenuous to sit there with her friends and discuss plans I knew I wouldn\u2019t be a part of, so I made a choice. Maybe the wrong one \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Starting out with, \u201cI don\u2019t owe you an explanation but I\u2019ll give you one,\u201d was also super combative and unnecessary. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m too busy to participate, but thanks for asking.\u201d", "Bingo. That\u2019s it - you came across as combative and then insulted her at her own party. If youre raising kids, you might want to learn better ways of communicating. Edited to add- for your original story, you didn\u2019t sound nice about it, or \u201ccivil\u201d. you immediately went to \u201cI dont have to explain myself\u201d to then \u201cyour not my friend\u201d when she brought up how you did have time previously and she didn\u2019t understand. \n\nSo every time you say you tried to be civil and nice- I don\u2019t really believe you. That\u2019s your way of defending and rationalizing yourself. If you were just sympathetic and honest with her upfront the whole blow up could have been avoided. And \u201cmy situation in different this year\u201d is a way more civil answer then \u201cyour not my friend\u201d no, she\u2019s FAMILY and trying to build a relationship with you.", "It wouldn\u2019t take long to send a text saying that you couldn\u2019t do it beforehand, I understand you were busy but if not making a scene was so important to you you should\u2019ve waited until after the party. Saying that she\u2019s not your friend was a huge AH move, she\u2019s marrying into your family and this is how you start off? Once things cool down maybe you should apologize to her for saying that", "Then I think NTA. I think if someone's gonna get snappy with you, they should expect you to get snappy back.", "You mean, the commitment level that Kim was talking about, at which point Kim\u2019s explanation cemented the fact that OP doesn\u2019t want to do it? OP should have asked about the expected commitment level after being told about the list of activities she was expected to take part in? Please, tell me how that makes sense. OP already one she didn\u2019t want to. Kim\u2019s list of activities bridesmaids were expected to participate in was even more of a turn-off for OP. OP doesn\u2019t need to further ask what else is expected when the list of activities alone solidified her decision that she didn\u2019t want to participate. She got through part of the expected commitment and decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. Why would hearing all of it make her decide otherwise?", "Yes, as a whole there are \u201cstandard\u201d bridesmaid things that happen. My main point is that it would have been better to first explain that you couldn\u2019t support those extra activities and see if she would still want you as a bridesmaid given that information. You obviously know her better than anyone on here, so maybe you have some background that we\u2019re missing here. I do think you at least owe her an apology for the \u201cyou and I are not friends\u201d line.", "Yeah I do get that, it must have been stressful! but doubling down on the we\u2019re not friends is going to be a hard one to solve. Do you want to have a relationship with her or would you rather not? If you do I\u2019d wait for tensions to calm a little and invite her for coffee, clear the air. You both could have reacted better but I think the ball is in your court for whether you want to reach out, I\u2019m not sure she would after we\u2019re not friends part.", "I don\u2019t mean to say that Kim isn\u2019t doing these activities at all. I\u2019m saying that just because they\u2019re planned doesn\u2019t mean that every member of the bridal  party is forced to participate, especially in circumstances like OP\u2019s.\n\nOf course the bridesmaids were talking about the things they were planning, it\u2019s exciting for them. But please tell me where Kim (or anyone else) said \u201cOP, you have to take part in these activities\u201d.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t want to reach out until I had some perspective on whether or not I should bite the bullet and change my mind. Either way I will reach out and apologise for the scene cause because that whole thing was not needed. \n\nAs I said, I think Kim is great for Tom, so I would like to be in a good place with her. I don\u2019t think we will/need to be \u201cfriends\u201d for that to be the case, but for sure when I decide how to approach the bridesmaid thing, I will reach out to her."]}
