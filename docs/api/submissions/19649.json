You are completely correct; she is not a friend. A friend would understand! You have no need to devote your time and money to an endless well of narcissistic demands.", "NTA - people are supposed to do these \"bridesmaid proposals\" (which I don't love for separate reasons but I digress) with the purpose of letting you say yes OR no. It's a request, and one that you had great reasons to refuse. The bride sounds unreasonable, and you dodged a bullet. \n\nMaybe I wouldn't have had the fight about whether you two are friends or not at her engagement party, but you're within your right to decline, and she made an assumption that placed her in an uncomfortable position.

It probably should\u2019ve been a priority to tell her as soon as you received the proposal and saying \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend\u201d was pretty rude if she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong to you. She also shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you and should\u2019ve accepted your choice like an adult when you told her, though.", "ESH\n\nYou are an asshole because you choose the engagement party to tell her no. You should have waited and had a phone call with her and your brother to explain why you can't be a bridesmaid. Also telling her you are not her friend was a bit petty imo.  She is about to be part of your family and is an important person to your brother. \n\nShe is the asshole because she should have gracefully accepted your decline.

ESH", ">referring to the fact that an employee of my husband got married last year and I planned and hosted their wedding\n\nInfo: That does sound like something that took a lot of time. So is your reason really that you don't have the time to be a bridesmaid? If you tried to talk to her about it first, and told her that you could be a bridesmaid only if you were a \"part-time\" bridesmaid, as in you wouldn't necessarily go to all the bridesmaid activities, but you would be part of the wedding party on the day of, would she have said no to that compromise? Or did you not want to do it even if that was the circumstance? Because reading through this post, it does kind of sound like you don't like her, beyond just a she's not your style kind of thing. And even if you don't see her all the time, she is going to be part of your family now, and now you've created a really awkward relationship for you two. At the very least you could've handled your response to her better.", "Nta. Turns out I missed a very important part of this post. I thought her husband being hospitalized was a couple of days later, I didn\u2019t realize it was the next day. My eyes must\u2019ve glossed over that. Sorry. \n\nBut honestly, it might\u2019ve been better just to go along with it until after. That\u2019s what I would\u2019ve done. Wait till the party was over and then told her.\n\nEdited to change my verdict.", "ESH.  All you had to say was \"While I'm honored that you asked, it is not something I will be able to do.\"  But instead, you got on your high horse with the \"I don't have to explain myself to you\" remark.  And the \"you and I aren't friends\" was just plain mean.\n\nKim is also TA because she wouldn't accept you declining and sent her flying monkeys to harass you.\n\nBoth of you are unpleasant people.", "ESH while no is a complete sentence and no one is entitled to the reasoning behind your choices, it's normally an asshole move in situations like this to not give a reason. I'm also not sure why you couldn't have taken 30 seconds in the days/weeks before her engagement party to shoot your SIL a text letting her know that you appreciate the offer but won't be able to be a bridesmaid.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, her and her friends are assholes for their extreme reaction and behavior. You're not an asshole for saying no, you're an asshole for your attitude and choices regarding how you handled this situation.", "ESH. I feel like Kim should\u2019ve been more understanding but you definitely could\u2019ve handled it differently. She obviously think highly of you and wants be to on good terms with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister. Maybe come to some agreement that you\u2019ll be her brides mate but due to a busy schedule you sadly won\u2019t be able to plan the bachelorette or engagement party, but you\u2019ll stand by her side and support her on the wedding day.", "YTA.  I think someone being flatly told \u2018no\u2019 to the request of \u2018will you stand up for me and your brother at our wedding\u2019 it\u2019d be kind of common to immediately just ask the knee-jerk question of \u2018why\u2019?   For you to \u2018calmly\u2019 reply that you don\u2019t owe her an explanation and she needs to respect your answer would be something I might answer passive aggressively to a coworker I generally and genuinely dislike asking me to contribute to their neighbors gofundme, and someone I also don\u2019t care how I come off towards.   \n\nYou cement that impression by explaining very helpfully that you don\u2019t consider her a friend\u2026at all.", "ESH. It seems to me like you don't even like her, and any time someone describes themselves as \"calmly explaining\" things to others, my AH flags go off.

Like, come on. You could have just said your life is much busier now than it was when you helped with an employee of your husband's wedding (which is a bit much and I understand your SIL here- it's not like you described it as helping with a *friend's* wedding last year) \n\nAnd then just your general attitude towards SIL and your sneering at her personality and activities planned. Jeez, get off your high horse. People say no to being bridesmaids all the time because of the financial and time commitments. You should have just approached it in that manner instead of demeaning her.", "YTA you forgot to tell her no and then remembered in time to ruin her engagement party.  In such a cold, nasty way. That's what makes you a huge AH. Not because you didn't want to be a bridesmaids.", "YTA, your We\u2019re not friends probably broke her heart in addition to ruining her party. \nWhy do you talk to your future SIL like it\u2019s HR?\nShe seems like she\u2019s really making an effort to build a relationship with you, but it doesn\u2019t seem to mean anything to you.", "INFO: Did Kim know that your husband was in the hospital?", "YTA. You treated this like your boss asking you to do something out of your scope. This is your brother's wife trying to become more integrated in your family and be friendly with you. Did you even talk with your brother about this? Maybe he was the one who asked his fiance to invite you to be a bridesmaid. And you completely ignored the request (how long was it between the request and the party? Weeks??), and was extremely rude to her at her ENGAGEMENT party about the whole thing after you ghosted and never responded to her, and then pointedly told her how little you care about her at all. Damn dude, I don't think you could get any colder. You say you like her and she's good for your brother, but you can't even pretend to be friendly though, huh? The real question should be \"aita for how poorly I treated my brothers fiance at her engagement party?\". I was originally going to say ESH because sure, if you can't commit then be honest and she needs to accept that, but after thinking about it, you just did this all wrong. Poor girl.", "NTA you tried to politely tell her no and she wouldn\u2019t accept that answer. Your delivery wasn\u2019t great, but she was the rude one here and created the issue.", "YTA.", "YTA. You should have given her a heads up, so you wouldn't have caught her off guard at her engagement party. Also, saying you won't be a bridesmaid because you're not friends, (which to her makes it clear that you don't like her) is a super shitty thing to do. You should've leaned harder into your busy working mom excuse. Or just sucked it up and been a bridesmaid. Realistically, if you had time to plan another friends wedding, you can handle the minimal responsibility of being a bridesmaid in your brothers wedding imo. By your own admission, you just don't like her so you don't want to. So clearly, that's bound to cause some unnecessary strife.", "YTA,  \n\n\nI think you could learn to be more tactful and less brutally honest. That wasn't the time or place as you mentioned.", "YTA.

Lets enjoy the party and we can talk about this later...but now is not the time and place for that discussion.\"\n\nAnd if she continued to hound you, you simply tell your husband you are leaving and that he needs to uber home\n\nInstead...you allowed yourself to feel as if she was personally attacking you, things escalated, and you said something you can't take back and that will ultimately...prevent you from being able to be in the same room as her from now on without drama or tension\n\nAnd yes, she was an ahole for confronting you.  But you didn't need to fire back.\n\nSometimes you gotta know when to walk away", "ESH. she shouldn\u2019t have snapped like that but you handled that really poorly. it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re not friends, you\u2019re future family. you were rude af. and yeah, if you planned and hosted an entire wedding but won\u2019t be a bridesmaid because of a busy schedule, that wouldn\u2019t make sense to me either. you could be a bridesmaid and just not participate in a lot of activities. compromises could have been made.", "She'll remember this forever.", "I was with you until the \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d comment. \n\nBut I still say NTA.

Sorry but girls like Kim irritate TF outta me.\n\nAnd FWIW, I think telling Kim you aren\u2019t friends is just fine honestly. You\u2019re not. Why lie? I mean, maybe the timing was off but she was pushing too hard and something was bound to happen. She will get over it.", "NTA. she asked you, you said no. you have the rights to refuse as much as she has the rights to ask you. she could not push you to do what you dont wanna do.", "ESH", "Esh. Why couldn\u2019t have told her you\u2019re actual reasons instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t need an excuse\u201d.

She sounds insufferable.", "YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE!!!!  Telling your future SISTER IN LAW during her ENGAGEMENT PARTY that you are not friends???  JFC, the absolute lack of awareness!  If I were her I'd be mortified that you acted so classless in front of friends, not on her behalf, but on yours.  If I were one of her friends I would feel awful that she had to deal with you, honestly.  You sound super self absorbed, and like you think you are too good for your enthusiastic, loving sister in law.  Life is short, and one day you may find yourself wishing you didn't act like you were too good and important for your own family.", "ESH. I understand you\u2019re busy, but you could squeeze a short phone call in to let her know. She shouldn\u2019t have been so emotional, but you were pretty rude. This woman is going to be at your family events for the rest of your days.", "ESH but more you for taking a whole week to tell her you're not going to be in her wedding party. Doing it at the engagement party was low", "NTA for not wanting to be a bridesmaid, but jesus - you sound like a fairly shitty person. \n\n>'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'.\n\nWTF was that? Do you feel cool about being super cold to people or something? I bet you slap yourself on the back for that one liner. \n\nBest of luck with the whole family thing.", "ESH, this mostly could have been avoided by a simple text. You waited until their engagement party when she was introducing you to bridesmaids to tell her, at any point in the week you could have dropped her a quick text saying \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but I can\u2019t accept, I really don\u2019t have the time with everything going on. I\u2019ll explain further at the party\u201d. You also sound pretty rude with \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain myself\u201d after you dropped this on her at her engagement party. Telling her \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d is the icing on the cake and just ensures your relationship with your ~~husbands~~ brothers family will be affected by this.  She should have dropped it once it was made clear you don\u2019t want to do it but I understand why she snapped, telling her at the engagement party after she\u2019s introduced you to bridesmaids is setting her up for quite an embarrassing moment. When she snapped back what?! why?! she obviously taken aback by your rejection and you respond with rudeness I\u2019m not surprised it blew up. \n\nI do kinda think the bottom line is here that you don\u2019t really like her and do not care enough about her to try. Why are you upset about the \u201cwhy did she ask anyway?\u201d Comment? If you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re not friends, it\u2019s a valid question. She\u2019s hurt because she thought you were closer than that, that the wedding would bring you even closer and with your rejection this just kinda cemented that you don\u2019t want to have that relationship. It will affect things going forward, she likely won\u2019t want a friendship with you and it may end up causing tension down the line.", "NTA\n\nWhile the \"you and I are not't friends\" line was harsh it was only in response to her refusing to accept your no for an answer. \nYou have a lot going on with your family and work but even if you didn't no is full sentence.", "Yep. Stone cold. I pity anyone in your life.", "ESH\n\nTo be honest the timing was pretty bad and you didn't have to mention the \"not friends\" part, but I understand why you wouldn't want to do it. It's a lot of activities for a young mom and you two aren't even close.\n\nIt's your delivery that makes you the asshole. This should've been handled days earlier in a more gentle way. Sounds like Kim was trying to bond with you and since you two are going to be family soon you could've put more focus on the busy schedule and caring for a baby.\n\nKim sucks for her reaction, but I suspect alcohol played a part in it. She also didn't wait for you to confirm and assumed you'll do it.", "NTA. Your husbands medical emergency precluded you telling her no right away. She cornered you at the party and wouldn't take your no as an answer. You aren't close with her, you don't want to do it, and even if you did, you are obviously too busy. She should have called you first to ask. The bridesmaid proposal idea is cute, but presumptive. It seems more like she voluntold you. If she were asking then she should have been prepared for a no.", "NAH\n\nSounds like Kim was either under the impression you two are friends OR was hoping/imagining you two would become friends - possibly sisters - now she's formally joining the family. Does Kim have sisters? You mentioned her other bridesmaids were her friends, and she was very excited about introducing you to each other.\n\nWhereas you see Kim as your brother's partner. You are happy she is good for your brother but you wouldn't associate with her if they weren't together. Unfortunately these differing understandings of what your relationship is and will become came out at the engagement party when people had been drinking. I don't think Kim's an AH for her hurt and/or disappointed and I don't think you're an AH for wanting to attend the wedding as a guest. Hopefully Kim will be able to adjust her expectations and you all can move on.", "ESH. \n\nShe should have accepted you declining, but you waited to tell her at her engagement party and made the point of saying she\u2019s not your friend. I get you were frustrated having to explain yourself but your whole manner and approach was just mean. So YTA more here. \n\nFrom the outset you \u2018calmly tell her you don\u2019t have to explain yourself\u2019\u2026 I mean you could have just apologised and said something like \u2018it\u2019s really kind of you to consider me but I\u2019m really busy in this period especially with a toddler\u2019. But you\u2019re already coming at her that she doesn\u2019t even get a reason and it seems argumentative just because she \u2018snapped asking why\u2019. \n\nYou could have even waited until the next day to call her in private and talk about it, but you turn up pull her to the side tell her she doesn\u2019t get to know why and then when she\u2019s upset you say she\u2019s not your friend. \n\nI get that establishing boundaries and honouring your own commitments is important, but way to burn the relationship", "NTA  - NO is a full sentence and if she hadn't pushed the issue it wouldn't have blown up that way.

Sounds like you just don\u2019t like her and took this opportunity to make sure she knows.", "Honestly, yeah - I think YTA here.\n\nNot because you didn't tell her right away - that could've been handled by a quick apology.\n\nBut since you didn't tell her beforehand, what you should've done is to wait to tell her after this party rather than to try to do this in the moment. So you make some small talk with some bridesmaids and find out some of the activities - so what? Just nod and smile and then the next day after the party, talk to Kim then.\n\nIt's not absurd that Kim asked you, nor that she thought you'd say yes. You're certainly not obligated to do so, and declining absolutely doesn't make you an asshole, but asking a future family member to be in the wedding party isn't a strange thing to do, and accepting to be in a future family member's wedding party even when you're not friends isn't a strange thing either.\n\nAnd the whole \"we're not friends\" thing is just unnecessarily cold.", "NTA.  I really don't get why you're being given such a hard time here in comments. You had a medical emergency and a toddler to deal with. You couldn't respond promptly because you had more immediate things to deal with. Of course you had to prioritize your spouse's medical emergency over a wedding that is a year away. Given the circumstances you were as gracious as possible in telling Kim that you couldn't be her bridesmaid. You made the best possible effort to decline privately. No is a complete sentence. It is always an ah move to press when someone has declined an invitation, especially when that invitation is as time and money intensive as being a bridesmaid. She's the one who forced you to publicly explain why you were willing to be a bridesmaid for someone while declining to be hers.

You dropped the ball by not responding immediately that you couldn't be a bridesmaid because of your hectic life and it wouldn't be fair to her or your brother.  If you want any kind of relationship in the future, ask her to lunch and, if she accepts, apologize for being harsh and that you didn't mean to be cruel.  You were caught off guard and the wedding she spoke of earlier was before a child and you just didn't think you could be there for her as a bridesmaid.

It wouldn\u2019t have killed you to smile and make vague statements to the other bridesmaids, and then tell Kim later. \n\nBut also, she\u2019s going to be family. It\u2019s pretty much an obligation to be in the wedding if asked, and you\u2019re definitely fucking up your relationship with her, your brother, and then any children they may have (if they plan to), by not being in the wedding. No one said you had to go to the bachelorette, or go to any other extracurriculars. You could have told her that up front.

This woman is about to be a part of your family, and you flat out told her she is not your friend in front of everybody. Personally that would break my heart and I would question if I did something wrong. Also you should have let her know the second you got it. It takes 3 minutes to shoot a text or email explaining it. Your husband had a medical need the *next day* so you had time to do that. Blaming your husbands medical needs *the next day* is an excuse. Ultimately this is your own fault imo. \nHowever she should have accepted your decline and not stated you make time for what you want, that\u2019s rude too.

My sister, for example, only had her mom and her maid of honor at her dress fitting. \n\nOP could have easily explained why she couldn\u2019t do any extracurriculars, but would still be happy to stand with her at her wedding. As it seems like Kim was quite fond of OP, there probably would\u2019ve been a decent chance of Kim being on board with it.", "That\u2019s fair, I still think a simple text before the party would have avoided this. Rejecting her at her own engagement party right after she\u2019s introduced bridesmaids and all sat there talking about plans is going to likely have the reaction you got. Not telling her before the party is what\u2019s amplified the issue.", "Ohhh got it. I mean, it clearly came across as combative, I really didn\u2019t mean it like \u201cI hate you you deserve to be pelted with rotting fruit\u201d, it was more because she was comparing two different situations and deciding they were the same. But yes, probably could have tried some other way to say it.", "How was it rude? It is a statement of fact. My sister is married and her husband and I are not friends at all. There is no iota of friendship between us. He knows I'm not his friend and I want nothing to do with him, and the feeling is reciprocated. Some people will just never be friends and that's acceptable. Just because someone is marrying into the family doesn't make them family.", "I said \u201cKim it was kind of you to ask me to be a bridesmaid, but I won\u2019t be able to do it\u201d. She then snapped (and I do mean actually snapped) \u201cwell why not?\u201d", "Yeah, the \"I don't have to explain to you\" is like - maybe Kim wanted to know why so that she could try and accommodate  OP, but OP was just like \"nope, absolutely not\" about the whole thing. Especially since asking a future SiL doesn't read weird to me, it just reads like formally including the family in the wedding party.", "Yes, agreed. Op can be right and an AH, or she could have be polite and graceful about it.", "I thought no was a full sentence and suddenly it\u2019s not?", "Literally none of the examples being given are a universal requirement for bridesmaids. My point is that OP could have asked what the expected commitment level would have been before rejecting the offer.", "Just to clarify, the assumptions are correct. I mentioned briefly in the post about her friends talking about activities. There were at least five whole day/overnight activities planned, on top of any ad hoc planning that one is expected to help out with as a bridesmaid. I saw this coming from all the monogrammed items in the package. \n\nFair enough if you think I should have handled it differently etc. but they\u2019re absolutely correct about there being expectations of a time commitment.", ">OP was asked in an elaborate way (which is the norm nowadays) to be a bridesmaid\n\nThis isn't done where I live, and I imagine it would make it much more difficult to say no. Especially when the advice to brides (thanks Google) is that if you buy someone a great gift and make them feel special, they'll definitely say yes.\n\nSeems like you should at least get a *sense* of whether someone is willing before you send them monogrammed towels or invite them to a \"be my bridesmaid\" lunch or whatever it is.", "Yeah, it was unfortunate. My brain got scrambled spending most of the week in the hospital, and then it seemed really disingenuous to sit there with her friends and discuss plans I knew I wouldn\u2019t be a part of, so I made a choice. Maybe the wrong one \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Starting out with, \u201cI don\u2019t owe you an explanation but I\u2019ll give you one,\u201d was also super combative and unnecessary. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m too busy to participate, but thanks for asking.\u201d", "Bingo. That\u2019s it - you came across as combative and then insulted her at her own party. If youre raising kids, you might want to learn better ways of communicating. Edited to add- for your original story, you didn\u2019t sound nice about it, or \u201ccivil\u201d. you immediately went to \u201cI dont have to explain myself\u201d to then \u201cyour not my friend\u201d when she brought up how you did have time previously and she didn\u2019t understand. \n\nSo every time you say you tried to be civil and nice- I don\u2019t really believe you. That\u2019s your way of defending and rationalizing yourself. If you were just sympathetic and honest with her upfront the whole blow up could have been avoided. And \u201cmy situation in different this year\u201d is a way more civil answer then \u201cyour not my friend\u201d no, she\u2019s FAMILY and trying to build a relationship with you.", "It wouldn\u2019t take long to send a text saying that you couldn\u2019t do it beforehand, I understand you were busy but if not making a scene was so important to you you should\u2019ve waited until after the party. Saying that she\u2019s not your friend was a huge AH move, she\u2019s marrying into your family and this is how you start off? Once things cool down maybe you should apologize to her for saying that", "Then I think NTA. I think if someone's gonna get snappy with you, they should expect you to get snappy back.", "You mean, the commitment level that Kim was talking about, at which point Kim\u2019s explanation cemented the fact that OP doesn\u2019t want to do it? OP should have asked about the expected commitment level after being told about the list of activities she was expected to take part in? Please, tell me how that makes sense. OP already one she didn\u2019t want to. Kim\u2019s list of activities bridesmaids were expected to participate in was even more of a turn-off for OP. OP doesn\u2019t need to further ask what else is expected when the list of activities alone solidified her decision that she didn\u2019t want to participate. She got through part of the expected commitment and decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. Why would hearing all of it make her decide otherwise?", "Yes, as a whole there are \u201cstandard\u201d bridesmaid things that happen. My main point is that it would have been better to first explain that you couldn\u2019t support those extra activities and see if she would still want you as a bridesmaid given that information. You obviously know her better than anyone on here, so maybe you have some background that we\u2019re missing here. I do think you at least owe her an apology for the \u201cyou and I are not friends\u201d line.", "Yeah I do get that, it must have been stressful! but doubling down on the we\u2019re not friends is going to be a hard one to solve. Do you want to have a relationship with her or would you rather not? If you do I\u2019d wait for tensions to calm a little and invite her for coffee, clear the air. You both could have reacted better but I think the ball is in your court for whether you want to reach out, I\u2019m not sure she would after we\u2019re not friends part.", "I don\u2019t mean to say that Kim isn\u2019t doing these activities at all. I\u2019m saying that just because they\u2019re planned doesn\u2019t mean that every member of the bridal  party is forced to participate, especially in circumstances like OP\u2019s.\n\nOf course the bridesmaids were talking about the things they were planning, it\u2019s exciting for them. But please tell me where Kim (or anyone else) said \u201cOP, you have to take part in these activities\u201d.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t want to reach out until I had some perspective on whether or not I should bite the bullet and change my mind. Either way I will reach out and apologise for the scene cause because that whole thing was not needed. \n\nAs I said, I think Kim is great for Tom, so I would like to be in a good place with her. I don\u2019t think we will/need to be \u201cfriends\u201d for that to be the case, but for sure when I decide how to approach the bridesmaid thing, I will reach out to her.", "ESH. FSIL shouldn't have snapped at you and tried to pressure you into it. My SIL turned me down when I asked her so I've been in that situation; you take it gracefully. \n\nYou shouldn't have told her at her party and then told her she's 'not your friend.' Is that how you normally talk to people? Sometimes I can't believe what people say to each other on here.", "YTA, a really really big one.\n\n1. You didn\u2019t respond to the thoughtful request and sprung your decision on her at her engagement party. You are not an asshole for forgetting due to circumstances but you should have known that telling her at her party could be not to best time. \n\n2. Despite having not told her earlier and knowing that it wasn\u2019t the best time to tell her, you were immediately rude \u201cwhile I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you..\u201d that\u2019s rude! It\u2019s reasonable for her to ask for an answer and instead of being kind and gentle, you were a dick.\n\n3. She probably continued to question you because you were snarky off the and in your answer with the \u201cwhile I don\u2019t have to explain..\u201d and then you told her the reason you plan for others and not her is because she isn\u2019t your friend. Asshole. Why not tell her that you have more things going on right now than you did during the other weddings? \n\n4. There is no way something in this girl randomly \u201csnapped\u201d 4 separate times in the span of 4 minutes. Get a new word and realize that you caused the reaction.", "No, she\u2019s not your friend. She\u2019s about to be your brother\u2019s wife, which will make her family.  That\u2019s why she asked you to be a bridesmaid, and apparently took a lot of care in the asking. Because the point of weddings is to bring families together.\n\nWhen I got engaged the first thing my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister said was, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be a bridesmaid!\u201d I hadn\u2019t intended to ask her because I wanted a very small wedding and wedding party. But I realized immediately that she belonged in the ceremony because she was his sister. Now, 20 years and 4 children between us later, she is absolutely one of my very best friends, I love her and can not imagine my life without her. \n\nYou should have accepted, because of family. You could have worked around the time obligations.\n\nNow you\u2019ve created hard feelings that will cover every family event in the future.", "I was going N-T-A until \n\n>At which point I said 'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'.\n\nOuch. That is cold. You just basically told her that you don't like her *and* that your non-family friend's wedding is more important to you than your brother's and hers. Maybe that's not what you said, but it's almost definitely what she heard. ESH.", "\u2018\u2026you and I are not friends\u2019 what a weird tactless thing to say to your future sister-in-law. Why go out of your way to hurt someone\u2019s feelings. \nYou could have handled this in a much kinder way,", "YTA. But not because you don't want to be a bridesmaid, because you could have handled it better. Firstly you should have spoken to her straight away but obviously you husband's medical emergency took up your brain space and that's totally understandable. But telling her at her engagement party then immediately saying you don't need to explain yourself is pretty rude and unnecessarily hostile. I'm not surprised she was pissed! I think if you forget to tell someone you don't want to be their bridesmaid and then drop the bombshell at their engagement party you do owe them an explanation and also an apology. Then you told her you weren't friends! again, no need to say this. It's a mean thing to say! No wonder she was upset! You could have gone with \"I did organise my friend's wedding and it was so hard, I bit off more than I could chew. I'm so sorry! I just can't do it again with a toddler to look after it's just too much. I didn't know how to tell you because I didn't want you to be disappointed but I really can't do it.\"", "Regardless of how you feel about her or doing this, you\u2019re not thinking long term and how this will forever impact your family relationships. She\u2019s hopefully going to be your brothers wife for years and years. The way you handled this is going to make that relationship very awkward or worse, unless you take steps now to actively make amends and right this. \n\nYou seem to have put no thought into why she asked you. I asked my fianc\u00e9s sister because that was his only sibling and i wanted him to have family involved. I can\u2019t imagine how devastated I would have been had she said no and told me we weren\u2019t friends. You are about to be family with this person. Again, I think you\u2019re being very short sighted.", "YTA, in regards to the specific question asked in the title. In almost every wedding I've been to, the opposite sex siblings of the people getting married become bridesmaids/groomsmen to the other partner. It's not about you being friends with her - it's about you standing up for your brother.\n\nNow, she absolutely reacted poorly. She should have accepted what you said, and then she and your brother could have talked about how YTA in private. But that doesn't change you. The best course for you would have been saying, \"I will of course stand up at the wedding for you and my brother. However, I don't have time for the activities. If you need someone who can attend all of them, I understand and will bow out now. Either way, thank you for asking me to be a part of this.\"", "Well,  that was needlessly mean. YTA for saying you are not friends. She is marrying your brother and will be a part of your family, and may well be around long after you forget the employee\u2019s name. She didn\u2019t invite you because you are one of her closest friends, she invited you because she wanted to include her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister in the wedding. \n\nSo fine if you don\u2019t want to and don\u2019t have time, but I don\u2019t see why you are being all superior about it, even if she did question your reasons. You shouldn\u2019t have told her at the party either, oopsie, so double YTA. Way to welcome her into the family, guess you let her know she is insignificant to you.", "YTA, who shows up to an engagement party to let the bride know they don\u2019t want to be in the wedding party?", "YTA. Easily yta. I mean jesus christ, You definitely don't HAVE to be a bridesmaid, you aren't obligated. But you were tactless, rude, and plain unfair in how you handled this. Almost a little cruel, even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then I read your replies and they all seem quite defensive and not open to the perspectives of those that feel you were out of line. Are you here to reflect and gain new insight into how you might have acted poorly, or to get vindication?", "> I calmly told her that while I don't have to explain myself and didn't appreciate her not respecting my answer\n\nYTA. You don't HAVE to explain yourself. You don't HAVE to do anything. And sometimes it's the things we don't do that make us the asshole.\n\nYou're allowed to say no. Your SIL is allowed to reject your reasons and consider you an asshole... That's kind of the two-way street that happens when people start thinking along the lines of, \"These are my feelings and yours don't matter\".\n\nYou were clearly stressed but unfortunately, you are still responsible for your actions. You were never obligated to accept the responsibilities but you did not need to be so cold.\n\nThe situation was handled poorly.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not obligated to be her BM. My SIL accepted the request of being my BM even though later on it was pretty clear she wanted nothing to do with it. It diminished the experience for me and I wish she just would have said no instead of being a drag the entire time. \n\nYou were kind enough to say no when you knew you weren\u2019t up to it, whether it be your busy schedule or just not having the emotional capacity to support someone you admittedly don\u2019t like. However, she was kind enough to want to honor you as her FSIL and want include you in the party. You could have returned her the consideration by letting her know your answer timely, not being overly curt when she asked why, and not blatantly being rude by telling her \u201cwe\u2019re not friends.\u201d That is an excellent way to alienate your SIL, brother, and their future family. If I were her I wouldn\u2019t even want you at the wedding at this point.", "YTA. Sending Kim a quick text declining her bridesmaid proposal was the considerate thing to do. Instead you waited until the party and then told her you didn\u2019t owe her an explanation for declining. While true, it was a strangely rude response especially considering how much you say you value your brother\u2019s feelings and opinions.", ">She snapped, asking why, at which point I calmly told her that while I don't have to explain myself and didn't appreciate her not respecting my answer,  \n>  \n>I said 'yes, but Kim, you and I are not friends'.\n\nYTA. She's probably snapped because you waited till the engagement cocktail party to let her know that you can't be her bridesmaid. You do owe her an explanation.", "ESH. I think you should have told her sooner I think that\u2019s kinda why she got angry when she was introducing you to her bridesmaids. You probably embarrassed her. And you are definitely an AH for saying that you guys aren\u2019t friends. Especially when you were in front of friends and family.

Stating that you are not friends with your future SIL may be true, but was a harsh way to communicate your feelings.\n\nN T A for not being able to be a bridesmaid, but Y T A for the delivery of your refusal.

No wonder the girl bawled her eyes out.  \n\nYou messed up the first time for not denying sooner. Can't blame her, getting excited for nothing. The girl was shocked. A little tact could have help you solve it peacefully, but it is ruined now.

She obviously views you as a friend and an important one to ask you to be a bridesmaid.

And you should have told her you couldn't become a bridesmaid before hand. Your excuses are just excuses. No one in their life is so busy that they can't spare 2 minutes to pick up the phone and make a call. If you want someone to respect your decision then you need to be civil about it. And you're also acting entitled here. You can't blame her for getting hyper in you because you literally told her you can't become her bridesmaid a few days prior. It's a common human reaction. And you were unnecessarily rude and giving shit excuses.", "ESH. Just because you didn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid doesn\u2019t justify you going Regina George on her.

And even though she could make the time she won't (As she pointed out op managed to make time for a co-worker, whose not even family or soon to be family, so it's reasonable for her to think that op could do it if she wanted to)\n\nAnd saying \"we're not friends\" is definitely a huge asshole move; that's pretty cruel.

WTF did she think was going to happen when she was face-to-face with the bride-to-be.  OP is YTA for stepping into such a situation so wantonly.  That was a very tactless move.", "But she had time PRIOR to the party to decline.", "Why didn\u2019t she tell her BEFORE the party?\n\nThere is literally no reason she couldn\u2019t have sent a text - even when she was on the way to the party. \n\nThis is entirely on Op.  She just uses the hospital as an excuse. What about the rest of the time?", "She was obviously upset and wanted to know the reason. Telling her at her engagement party, after she has announced bridesmaids and in public is going to irk someone, however unavoidable the timing was. There was absolutely no need for you to escalate it by telling her you don't owe her an explanation. This was someone who was upset by your refusal, so her reaction was understandable. But it seemed like you had no desire to soften the blow and instead your response was immediately passive aggressive and then very mean, on her engagement party no less.\n\nYou aren't TA for refusing, but you are for how you handled it.", "Why are you even asking if you're the AH?", "You're not wrong, but you are an asshole. I mean your first response when she asked why was that you don't have to explain yourself. That's pretty rude, even if technically correct. She's clearly trying to build a relationship with you, and you threw it back in her face and told her she's not your friend. That really sucks.", "But you basically admitted that wasn\u2019t the real reason you\u2019re declining. You *could* make the time because you planned and hosted your friend\u2019s wedding, but you don\u2019t want to do the same for her. Which is fine, but you definitely should *not* have told her that she\u2019s not your friend that was a really shitty move. Yes she also overreacted, but you took it too far YTA", "So...you don't really like your brother, either? I have kids and a fun vacation schedule, too.

But let's not pretend you're \"too busy.\" You just don't like these people and it shows lol.", "Exactly. It\u2019s pretty easy to have a conversation with her and say something like, \u201cwith a baby and a hectic year ahead, I unfortunately won\u2019t be able to participate in any pre-wedding events.

Wow. Just wow.  You could have texted her while you were getting ready for the party. You know, 1 less minute on your makeup is all it would have taken to avoid the whole scene. You\u2019re not acting like someone who wants a relationship with your brother going scorched earth on his \u201cexcitable\u201d fianc\u00e9. Frankly, your own post makes you look like an unfeeling snob who\u2019s using excuses to be passive aggressive because you don\u2019t like her.

She doesn't have to go to the bachelorette party.  As for the sitting for make-up, she'd be sitting for make-up as a bridesmaid or a guest that does her own make-up. Literally could say yes, but she can't do some of the stuff outside of her fittings if someone can't watch her child. She's totally the AH for saying we're not friends to her future sister-in-law as part of the reason for not being a bridesmaid, too. It's normal to be a bridesmaid for your siblings' wedding and their fianc\u00e9.", "She literally explained that the FSIL isn't what your brother in law is.

Nothing suggested that prior to this incident there was any reason for actual animosity or the need to avoid functions where FSIL is present. Just seems like completely different situations.", "Life happens. That's not the problem. The problem is how unkind you were. It was wrong and totally unnecessary.", "You didn't explain until she specifically asked because \"you don't owe her an explanation\" which is just rude.

If she's deep in planning, she probably didn't even realize you *didn't* respond OR could have noted your medical emergency and assumed it slipped your mind. Should she have assumed? Not at all, but her intentions were no malicious yet you answered in a malicious way.

It seems unnecessarily harsh and inflammatory, even if it is true. Maybe reach out to her in private to discuss? She\u2019s going to be family soon so it might be worthwhile to smooth things over.

Your reasons for not being able to participate are valid but if a potential bridesmaid came to me with those concerns I\u2019d find ways to allow you to participate but not feel obligated.

Yikes.", "At what point did you arrange a babysitter or did you take your toddler with you? Whilst arranging a babysitter for the cocktail party you didn\u2019t have time to send a quick text?

Why let her carry on thinking that?

Full stop. She assumed op has agreed to be her bridesmaid. When OP made it clear that she didn't want to be a bridesmaid the bride to be pressed her to explain herself. No one is obligated to be in a wedding party. No one should have to provide a reason for not wanting that responsibility. It is rude to continue to bug a person when they've already told you no.

I did not have the headspace for anything else; responding to a bridesmaid proposal would have been the furthest thing on my mind.", "Right, so she should deal with an event she doesn't want to do, for someone who she, almost certinally, knew would not react well to the refusal, on top of her husband in the hostpial, and her dealing with her kid? \n\nSure, that makes sense.", "Yeah sitting around worrying about if your husband is going to make it. Gawd.", "No.  Because OP knew that Kim was going to make things difficult no matter when she was called.", "Seeing how Kim took the rejection when it occurred, I don't blame OP for not telling her while her husband was in the ICU. Unfortunately. FSIL badgered OP until she said something that she probably wouldn't have said if circumstances were different. My question is where was OPs husband? He should have been backing OP up with minute she said no. And there isn't a lot of sitting around when a loved one is in the ICU. She still had a child she had to feed, bills that need to be paid, and families that need to be updated. When my brother had his stroke, I must have been on the phone with about 10 people a day. I wouldn't have had no time to even think about being a bridesmaid.", "Asking why, sure, but Kim snapped at OP. \n\nI think it was unreasonable for Kim to have assumed a non-response was an acceptance in the first place, especially for something that can be so time consuming and expensive for the bridesmaids.

It sounds like she was super excited to have OP on board and clearly put effort into asking her. \n\nTo me this is an INFO situation because I want to know what beef there is here, because there has to be. Either FSIL is a drama llama or *something* for OP to just go \"no\" (or OP just sucks).

There\u2019s no way in Hell I\u2019d ever be a bridesmaid or really anything else for her, because she\u2019s self centered, flaky and attracts drama like horse shit attracts flies.  We get along at things like family dinners and whatever, but she is not and will not ever be someone I would willingly subject myself to more than needed.  I\u2019m bucking the trend and saying NTA for OP, she might have been a little short in her answers, but she said I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t, and then SIL got snarky about it instead of accepting that while her wedding is very important to her, it is not the center of everyone else\u2019s lives", "Agreed it doesn't take long to send a quick text the night of.", "I don't know.

If you're going to write off someone's perfectly reasonable and understandable reasons for not doing something just because one time a year ago they did it for someone else, you're an asshole and need to grow up. When someone says no to a request, it's a full sentence. You're not entitled to their reasons and you certainly don't have any right to try to judge whether those reasons are valid or not for saying no to you. Not to mention one of the biggest lessons we teach to kids is that you don't have to be friends with everyone, people don't have to be friends with you, _and_ people are allowed to do something for one person without being expected to do that same thing for every person that asks. Op tried to be nice and was told \"you're actually not all that stressed and your not dealing with enough and definitely have plenty of space on your plate to do what I tell you to do\" while her fucking husband _has been going through medical problems_ and she's essentially a single parent to a toddler while working 2 jobs. After she explained her reasons to the bride to be and was met with \"so what you did it for your friend\" op is absolutely reasonable and not an asshole for pointing out that _they aren't friends._ It doesn't matter that she's marrying into the family most family members don't consider each other friends to fucking begin with. It's not an asshole move to not consider someone you're barely ever around as a friend (even if they were around each other often it still wouldn't be an asshole move.)

Kim was probably asking \"why?\" in response to OP's rejection to find out if it was a scheduling issue or a problem she could help with (monetary, babysitting, travel, etc). Kim probably really wanted OP as a bridesmaid and may have rearranged some things to ensure she could participate. Even if OP simply didn't want to, she could have been a hell of a lot nicer. While Kim's reaction wasn't perfect, I don't blame her. She was probably super embarrassed. This was neither the time nor the place to do this.", "This is by far the best comment here.\n\nYou can have whatever opinion you want on whether OP should\u2019ve said yes or no and if OP even has good reasons to say no, but there\u2019s no subjectivity to how it was handled.\n\nTo, at someone\u2019s engagement party, basically tell that person \u201cI won\u2019t be in your engagement party and I won\u2019t even tell you why\u201d, then when asked why to say \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d objectively makes you an AH.\n\nAt that point why even be there?  Do you think your brother still wanted you there knowing you can\u2019t even consider his fianc\u00e9 a friend?", "Yeah, this is where I'm at. I get things coming up and it slipping OP's mind. I get that she forgot until the party and didn't mean for it to come out publicly.\n\nBut it was the way OP actually told Kim once it came out that is the issue for me. If OP explained her reasons and kept saying no, different story. But, only from OP's story, it sounds like OP went straight to defensive mode as soon as Kim asked why the first time. A little too defensive when Kim would want to know why, although Kim's overall response was just as bad.\n\nNeither handled it well.", "1000% agree with this. If I had an award I would give it to you!", "exactly it was the 'i don't need to exp\\[lain myself to you\" that sealed it", ">I think if you\u2019d explained your reasons off the bat she may have been more respectful of your decision.\n\nNo.\n\nOP gave FSIL an answer, and FSIL completely ignored OP's answer and asked the reasons why *so FSIL could dismiss each reason and wear OP down.*\n\n\"But why??\", especially in public with her drunk bridesmaids, is harsh, unnecessary, and pushing OP's boundary.\n\nFSIL was not asking because she wanted to understand OP's reasons, she asked because she wanted more ammunition.", "Yes, exactly my thought. an empathatic human being would have responded like that. But OP was just being a mean asshole. \n\nI am Team Kim and vote YTA.", "FSIL never even reached out to her when her husband was in the hospital. Either she didn't know or she didn't care.\n\nThey *aren't* friends.", "Because I literally forgot she asked me. Everything before my husband got taken to hospital was a blur for that whole week. As I was on my way to the party, the first time I\u2019d had more than a minute to think about anything other than the health scare for more than a minute, I remembered. And then I thought, I won\u2019t tell her tonight, I\u2019ll tell her tomorrow since it\u2019s her party. Then the bridesmaid thing happened and it seemed shitty to have conversations about bridesmaid activities I knew I was going to be doing, so I thought best tell her now.", "Literally!!! Anything she could take responsibility for she deflects, in a snarky AH way, she knows she's the AH here clearly.", "I had my daughter at the hospital with me. And for the party, my husband and his friend were at home with her. \n\nI completely forgot Kim had asked me. Everything before my husband collapsed in his office was pretty much a blur from me until I was in the car, away from it all, and then I remembered.", "OP doesn't actually mention how long it was between her husband getting sick and the engagement party, and I doubt it all happened within the space of a week. Regardless, if you are on your way to an engagement party,  it's safe to say you aren't in emergence mode anymore. My guess is that OP was dreading having to refuse and seem cold to her FSIL, then the emergency happened, then she either forgot or kept procrastinating because she didn't want to deal with it, then  the time of the party came and she possibly hoped her silence had been taken for refusal, and then she acted defensively when questioned. \"I don't have  to justify my desicion\" is something you say to someone who keeps pressuring you, not immediately after an excited future family member asks why you won't participate in their event.", "So then she does it at the party? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me, that\u2019s possibly the worst place to do it", "The energy? Lol Op sounds very self focused. She doesn't like people who dont act like her or the way she finds acceptable. What a nightmare person. I feel bad for her brother and future SIL.", "She did state how \" excitable\" Kim is. I think she knew what was coming.", "I agree with this. I know what it's like to deal with family in long term hospital situations or emergency situations. Your headspace is concentrated on taking care of them, management of paperwork (which OP said she was handling when her husband went to the ER) and very little else to make sure life doesn't spiral out of control. Parties, engagements, all that stuff can end up on hold.\n\nOP also made the statement that she's abroad half the year for work related purposes. That's a good portion of her livelihood from the sounds of it. And she's a mom to boot.\n\nI also want to mention that there are details I would like to have more of in regards to Kim as a person, but this sub has a character limit (not a WORD limit) which forces the poster to leave details out where I feel they should be included. \n\nWith all that said OP at least knew she needed to put together a rejection in a way to keep things calm. I don't know the length of time between the ER visit and the party but I'm going to point out that Kim was the one who was pressing OP for an answer and cornered her at the oarty. OP even tried to keep it chill by pulling her aside to try and not make a scene. But Kim's inability to be an adult caused a scene and brought attention to the situation.\n\nI feel like Kim made the assumption that OP was going to accept and sounded like she announced to her other bridesmaids that OP would be part of the group, rather than assuming a \"no\" until otherwise stated.\n\nAnd for Kim to get upset like that and demand more than what she is owed is a little entitled. OP doesn't need to give a life story to say no. No is no and leave it at that.\n\nBased on this I'm going with NTA. This is a Kim issue, especially since the groom was understanding and wasn't making a big deal of it.", "I know that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing while sitting around. I haven\u2019t disputed that.", "OP didn\u2019t know that at all, where are you getting that?", "Exactly.  \n\nTalk about entitlement.   \n\nSIL assumed that OP would say yes.  Pretty big assumption.", ">especially for something that can be so time consuming and expensive for the bridesmaids\n\nLiterally all you\u2019re required to do is get fitted for a dress and show up earlier to the wedding than everyone else.  And even then, in this case it\u2019s her brothers wedding so she\u2019d have to come early anyway for family photos.\n\nThat\u2019s literally all that\u2019s asked of a bridesmaid compared to a regular attendee.  The rest like a bachelorette party is almost always optional.  If it\u2019s not in this case, then OP needs to clarify it.", "I am so glad I am not the only one seeing this. I would even go as far to bet that Kim never \u201csnapped\u201d at OP. The fact that she even questioned why? Was offensive enough to OP with the way she answered Kim that it\u2019s her prerogative and all that. So I\u2019m thinking OP says she \u201csnapped\u201d at her but I think she just asked and OP obviously doesn\u2019t like her so\u2026.", "Yeah, if I'm Kim, OP not only isn't a Bridesmaid, but she's disinvited from the wedding. Terrible behavior on OP's part. I wouldn't be surprised if OP's parents don't come down on her pretty hard for creating this mess.", "That's what really got me. \"I don't have to explain myself.\" So unnecessary.", "Exactly, and there was nothing wrong with the bride asking initially why she couldn't be a bridesmaid, the bride was probably asking so that if there were issues with some bridesmaids activities she might be able to address them so OP could still participate instead OP came back with \"I don't have to explain myself,\" which caused the escalation.  \nI also don't believe she had no time between receiving the request and the engagement party to address it with the bride beforehand. She had to know it would come up at the party. OP YTA.", "Well, she did eventually explain it: remember the part where she told them they weren't friends?", "She said \u201cwhile I don\u2019t have to explain myself\u201d then did explain to Kim why she couldn\u2019t. No means no and should be respected without having to give an explanation.", "Oh sure she did. A simple phone call to say it wouldn't have ruined her whole situation. Or she could've told her at the engagement party that they'd have to discuss it later without giving such a dry rude answer. She handled this way wrong and ruined someone's engagement party.", "Except this is her family and not a random salesman asking her to buy something. \n\nYou can tell by her responses OP has never been in the wrong and is incapable of admitting any fault for anything. \n\nAll she has are excuses as to why she couldn\u2019t take 5 seconds to send a text. \n\nYou really have to feel sorry for anyone in OPs life. What a selfish, rotten woman.", "Damn lol", "Things being true doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be rude. If I tell a friend they look like they\u2019ve gained weight, it might be true but it\u2019s still rude. The way she handled this was unnecessarily hostile.

It sounds like she put a lot of thought & effort into asking you to be a bridesmaid. She was excited to include you and introduce you to her other friends - and up until this point she probably assumed you WERE friends! Then you shut her completely down without even trying to be kind about it, or find any sort of compromise, or show any compassion towards her obvious disappointment.\n\nI was a bridesmaid for a friend who lived several hours away when I had a crawling baby & was just getting over the last dregs of PPD/A. I couldn't afford the time or money to participate in most of the events leading up to the wedding, I wasn't any help in planning the wedding itself, and I spent most of that day feeling flustered as I quickly swapped back & forth from nursing to posing for photographs, to changing a diaper to holding bouquets. But it meant SO MUCH to my friend simply having me there beside her on her special day, and I'm so glad I could be there for her. It would have been a pity if I had taken an \"all or nothing\" approach and denied us both that experience simply because I couldn't be a deluxe-edition bridesmaid.", "I\u2019m so confused over what you think it takes to be a bridesmaid.\n\nWhat planning are you needed for??

You could have handled that in a much kinder way.", "YTA, you were rude about it", "Honestly - after reading ofher comments and thoughts, I\u2019ve gone from ESH to YTA, and you should consider just not going to the wedding at this point. After all, ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t friends.", "boy, that sure was a lot of \u2018snapping\u2019 from poor Kim, which makes me seriously doubt if she was really that demanding. It\u2019s clear as day that OP doesn\u2019t like her, so I suspect she might find everything Kim says or does irritating.\n\nI understand not wanting to be a bridesmaid to someone you don\u2019t gel with, but this is your future SIL, so you might want to employ a modicum of tact or try to compromise. At the very least not break the news at the engagement party ffs.\n\nOP, even in your own post and comments you come off as selfish, dismissive and combative. I think you made sure Kim will never try to bond with you again, so yay for you. YTA", "Probably gonna get downvoted but, NTA. You tried pulling her aside to tell her privately and politely after what she more than likely knew was a stressful week with your husband in the hospital (assuming Tom knew & mentioned it to her). After privately declining, she made a scene and provoked your comment- which was admittedly rude but it seems to have been provoked. Yes the comment sucks, but not enough to make you the AH. Not accepting your answer is big time childish, provoking you enough to draw others attention and a rough comment is even more childish. Glad your brother has your back on this, and I hope your husband is okay & not suffering any long term problems as a result of his hospital stay!", "And the fact that maybe her brother asked her to consider making her a bridesmaid too", ">saying \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend\u201d was pretty rude if she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong to you.\n\nIt's not rude, it's just honest. You aren't obligated to pretend to be friends with people just so their feelings aren't hurt. It's not like OP was stringing Kim along or at any point made any type of suggestion that they were friends. Even other people wonder why Kim asked OP to be a bridesmaid. Kim simply assumed they were friends and, on her own,  decided OP should treat her as a friend. Then she got mad at OP for not doing so prompting OP to point out that they aren't friends. The statement may have been hurtful and eye-opening, but it wasn't rude.", "Yeah OP was so \u201ccalm\u201d and FSIL \u201csnapped\u201d right? OP you were clearly rude from the beginning, you obviously don\u2019t like your FSIL, and you ended up being outright mean to her. YTA and FSIL should be grateful she can just write you off now.", "Yeah I don't like how OP claimed Kim snapped by simply asking why. It's a super valid question, even if it's just out of curiosity. OP's response to that would have put anyone on the defense imo.", "yes! saying no to being a bridesmaid isn\u2019t inherently an AH thing to do. the way OP handled it makes her an AH. why couldn\u2019t she have \u201ccalmly\u201d told her no because of XYZ? why start with \u201ci dont owe you an explanation\u201d when, by her own account, she DID give an explanation by saying she wouldn\u2019t have time to plan and take part in activities?", "I agree, the way she answered Kim was really rude!!", "Agreed. Just say I\u2019m SO sorry I\u2019m so busy I\u2019m drowning with my toddler, my husbands health, (whatever make some shit up). I wish I could.

I also agreed 100% with the fact that she had time to message right away but didn\u2019t and just happened to let her know on the night of the party. She could have even messaged in the hospital, it doesn\u2019t take more than a minute.She\u2019s TA!!!", "This is an underrated response. You understood the situation perfectly. This OP does not have good communication skills at all.", "I kind of hate people that do this, but I'm really curious what \"snapped\" actually entails, considering how OP words some of the other things in their post.\n\n>Something snapped and Kim began bawling, her intoxicated friends started swearing at me...it was a long night.\n\nThis sentence alone is super irritating, at least to me.\n\n\"Something\" like it's a mystery, making sure to specifically include that the friends were intoxicated while defending their friend/the bride after OP was an AH, and including \"it was a long night\" when it probably felt a lot longer for the bride.\n\nNot saying the bride didn't snap, but OP seems like an AH regardless.", "Right? Like we're going to s*** on the bride before we tell her we're not her friend before we decline being her bridesmaid while we ignore the package that she put together for us and then be shocked that she might think we're an asshole?\n\n At least try to hide your disdain for the woman your brother is marrying if you want a non-biased answer here. It's clear you don't like her and she's not a priority.", "I don\u2019t think anybody is saying YTA because she said no to being a bridesmaid, but in the nasty way that she did it. Absolutely unnecessary to be so harsh, this woman is joining her family.

A bridesmaid's proposal isn't a command.", "This. And another thing that jumps out at me is her brother asking OP to change her mind because \"he says it would make his life easier.\" That suggests to me that Kim may not be as good for her brother as she thinks. \n\nReally, this is honestly all on Kim. She just flat-out *assumed* OP had said yes when she didn't actually answer one way or the other, so she didn't actually *have* an answer until she cornered OP at the party. \n\nAnd I don't really blame OP if she came off as rude with her response--she had a lot going on already and then she suddenly had to deal with all of this.", "Agreed. \n\nOP is not wrong for:\n\n* Not wanting to be a bridesmaid\n* Not responding before the party given the emergency\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is wrong for:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Saying \"I don't have to give a reason\" when Kim, entirely understandably, asked why. OP has good reasons for not wanting to be a bridesmaid, and if she'd explained those it would likely have been all fine. Saying that \"nobody is entitled to an answer\" is ridiculous in social interactions - saying no and refusing to say why is bound to make you think there's something else going on, like they really don't like you or you've done something wrong.\n* Saying \"we're not friends.\" That's totally fucking cold. Jesus Christ. It sounds like they were friendly before this - not best friends or anything, but got on fine - so that's a weird, mean thing to say. And unlike most of these disputes, it probably did put a dampener on the bride-to-be's engagement party.\n\nWhere I'm from (England), asking someone from the husband's side of the family to be part of the bridal party is common. It might not be where the OP is from, or they might come from slightly different traditions. Either way, it's usually a nice thing to do, to ask someone to be your bridesmaid - you don't have to react like the actual asking is an insult somehow.", "I also feel I should add that while OP most certainly doesn't have to be bridesmaid if she doesn't want she should consider making an effort to get to know this woman.\n\nFrom how OP describes it she thinks this girl is a great addition to the family and is wonderful for her brother but finds her annoying and maybe dramatic so she'd rather not hang out with her more than necessary.\n\nWell, she should think about how this girl is going to be in her family forever (ideally) which means holidays, birthdays, family vacations, dinners get together. If op's brother and her are kid people then there is going to nieces and nephews who will likely want to hang out together, so she should really think about how she wants those meetings and get-togethers to go. Because OP WILL be spending time with her whether she likes it or not and if her intent is to have as little contact as possible then things are going to get awkward and uncomfortable for everyone real quick and forever.\n\nSo does she HAVE to be bridesmaid, or be bestest buddies? Of course not! but I can promise that it is in her best interest to make an effort and find a way to not only connect with kim but make it so she genuinely likes spending time with her.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, from my own experience OP is really lucky that Kim clearly thinks highly of her and wants to be close with her. Because a surprisingly large amount of sisters and daughter-in-laws will just be polite and treat it as an obligation while Kim sounds like she has the potential to be someone OP could call for help at anytime.", "This is the answer.  It sounds like she doesn't like her FSIL anyway, and isn't interested in getting close because \"she lives abroad half of the year\", and she calls her \"excitable\".  The whole post reeks of snobby superiority.   And yet she seems to care about her brother or at least what he thinks.   That woman is going to be his wife.  Why wouldn't she attempt to have a good relationship with her? She sounds like she just can't be bothered.  If my future SIL had treated me that way, I would have been crushed.

That's what the party is for, the wedding that she was asked to be a bridesmaid for!", "So then tell her before the party. I don\u2019t buy she had no free moment to tell her, up until she was literally at the party staring the SIL in the face. Even texting her on the ride over would have been a better option. \n\nI had a good friend turn down my bridesmaid invite due to similar life circumstances (her FIL died, her demanding MIL just moved in with them, she was in a challenging medical program, unbeknownst to me she was pregnant, and she lived across the country) and she still found a moment to text me that she had to regretfully decline. OP put it off because it\u2019s an awkward thing to do, and created a situation where she\u2019s at an engagement party and still hasn\u2019t communicated her decision on being a bridesmaid.", "I'm gonna just put this here:\n\nYou are still making excuses.\n\nThis is aita, not a class on your lack of interpersonal communications and decorum.\n\nYTA", "You do sound unpleasant. Just with this response and how you worded the response at the engagement party. A lot of brides ask SIL to be in the bridal party.

I think the timeline is a little confusing, the fact that you and your husband were still going through that up until the party isn\u2019t totally clear, and it\u2019s setting you up to look like you were careless rather than just busy. Honestly, knowing that, why Kim\u2019s first question wasn\u2019t \u2018how is everything?\u2019 is kind of baffling and her general approach should have been kinder, including not dragging you off to meet strangers. \n\nIt all seems to be a case of people being wrapped up in their own thing (fairly or unfairly). It would be worth considering that you come off as annoyed that she even asked you, and that\u2019s not entirely fair - inherently she was doing a nice thing, trying to bond and include you when you don\u2019t know each other well, and generally making herself vulnerable, even if it was totally misplaced and she should have figured out on her own that you weren\u2019t going to have time or want to spend energy on something like this. There\u2019s no logical way you should end up having to be her bridesmaid, but a call or a coffee to smooth things over is probably due. If things with your husband are still going though, your brother needs to step up and field this one. Your shit is more important than her shit, but assuming she\u2019s not just a self absorbed lunatic, it sounds like she didn\u2019t have the full picture of what was going on with you and is justly hurt that you didn\u2019t even care enough to reject her kindly.", "YTA. I'm very sorry about your husband and hope he is recovering well. I understand the stress and worry would occupy you at first. But, you were going to an ENGAGEMENT party where the bride to be has asked you to be a bridesmaid. If you were capable of attending the party, you were capable of making a phone call to her prior to the party.

Very passive aggressive of you.", "Honestly the fact that this all happened within a week really changed my opinion from YTA/ESH, to NTA. I think you should add that into the post.

I don't get people commenting like personal/social communications have some kind of hard deadline for a reply that's less than 24 hours no matter what.\n\nIf we are dogging people for short notice, asking OP to be a bridesmaid one week before the event where the bridesmaids would be announced seems pretty short notice.", "Yep, this exactly. It can take a couple days to emotionally be in a place to carefully and empathetically say \"no\", while also having the energy to hold firm to a boundary. It takes a lot of energy to preserve people's feelings on sensitive topics like friendship, weddings, etc.  \n\n\nPart of the reason this situation ended so badly was that OP went in without the right mindset/forethought to how to carefully reject the bride-to-be. If she had, she probably would have been able to more gently diffuse the situation (and probably wouldn't have made the situation worse by blurting out \"we're not friends\" - even if it's true to OP.)  \n\n\nThat's just one reason to wait a beat to offer a rejection. Waiting a couple days to respond also would have shown bride that OP carefully thought about the offer and STILL said no. That way any arguments from the bride in the vein of \"Well, you just got the offer! Why don't you think about it some more?\" can be immediately shut down and stops prolonging the rejection.", "If that was part of it, why wouldn't OP mention that instead of very explicitly and repeatedly saying that they completely forgot due to being busy with other things?", "You know gasoline is flammable you don\u2019t wait u til the ember is a bonfire to pour it on it", "'I don't have to explain myself and a I don't appreciate you disrespecting my answer' as a response to your SIL asking why you won't be a bridesmaid is such a chronically online/Reddit response. I can't believe people actually talk like this in real life and expect a positive response. Literally all OP had to say was that she will be too busy with her child, but instead had to give the therapy-speak answer that's going to leave SIL wondering whether OP secretly hates her (which ngl it sounds like she does.)", "OP very easily could\u2019ve said \u201cmy husband had some health problems recently and there\u2019s a whole lot of stress on my plate right now.\u201d Even if she didn\u2019t want to go that far in she could\u2019ve at least explained the bare minimum instead \u201cItS nOnE oF yOUr BuSinESs\u201d (I know she didn\u2019t say that but it\u2019s the same energy and connotations as what she said)", "I also want to point out that one of FSIL points that she argued was, \"You planned and hosted a wedding for you friends before!

At OP's parents' house, btw.\n\nThe wedding is \"next spring\", so this is hardly \"being told at the last minute.\"", "Yeah, suggesting she\u2019d love to do it but would be too busy to commit to all parts would have been a very reasonable compromise here.", "My first thought was also ok, so you aren't friends, but perhaps that was the point.

That\u2019s hella rude. Turning down an immediate family member\u2019s wedding because you \u201cdon\u2019t have the time\u201d when everyone knows you just had the time to plan and host an entire wedding for some work related rando is pretty rude too. If I were Kim I\u2019d be wanting to know what my FSIL\u2019s problem was with me, because she very clearly has one. It\u2019s not hard to be nice and welcoming to a new member of your family even if they\u2019re not really friends like that. Obviously if she\u2019s asking she either doesn\u2019t have many friends of her own to ask, is trying to set up a bonding experience with her husband\u2019s sister, or both.

FSiL should accept the \"no\" but it's understandable why she would want an excuse and feel slighted after OP put in a lot more work for a friend. OP needs to learn some tact. Why was she invited as a bridesmaid? Maybe because... she's the groom's sister??? A discussion of compromise could have worked as others were saying - she's too busy to do the bridesmaid duties but maybe her brother wants his sister standing up there with the rest of his friends and family on his big day anyway.\n\nThat \"we are not friends\" comment. Big oof. OP has some maturing to do also. That was just downright cruel. Did FSiL even know about hubby's medical emergency? FSiL was trying to include OP in her friend group and making her feel welcome. An apology to FSiL is needed, maybe go out to lunch. Explain she was stressed with a young child and her husband's emergency and she reacted harshly. OP, this is your future family. Get to know her! Tell her your concerns and try to work out a solution together, even if it's just FSiL realizing that your \"no\" is probably the best option.", "This. OP simply stated that Kim \"snapped\" but didn't give any description of what was said or how it was said, and then went on to share all the relatively offensive things she told Kim in response to her asking \"why,\" which is a totally reasonable thing to ask someone. Seems like so many people in this thread are basing their entire decision on Kim \"snapping\" when I see almost no evidence that anything she did was out of line beyond perhaps seeming surprised or disappointed that her future sister in law is choosing not to take part in her wedding and took an extended period of time before telling her this at an inconvenient moment.", "It was probably more of a hurt exclamation. A Yelp maybe.", "Yeah, OP seems\u2026.difficult. There were any number of options, including a conversation about what she could and could not commit to as a bridesmaid.

She started off by saying that she wouldn't be able to. At which point FSIL should have accepted that as an answer. Does it suck for Kim? Yes. But No is a complete sentence. If I ask a favour from someone and they tell me no, I say ok, and move on. Because I am not entitled to assuming yes to their time.

There is no way she was unaware of OP's work schedule, toddler, husband's hospital stay, etc. She may have been trying to ask OP why to see if she could stay in the wedding party and just do a few events and the clash in personalities and alcohol lead to everyone taking it the wrong way. If SIL was expecting OP to say yes and change her schedule to be involved in a million different wedding activities, I would agree she was the AH and ESH.

She is obviously somewhat close to her brother because she had to help him the day he had a medical emergency, and is talking to him about FSIL\u2019s reaction. If I were to guess, FSIL was asking her why she was too busy to be a bridesmaid, because all she would have to do is buy a dress, do makeup stuff the day of the wedding, and stand during the ceremony. This whole thing seems weird and my guess is that there is more to this. There has to be some history as to why OP doesn\u2019t like her, doesn\u2019t want to be involved.", "You did a much better job of summarizing exactly how I feel. If the bride was really pressuring her, it would be shitty, but even then I think understandable. To so flippantly blow her off and tell her \u201cwe aren\u2019t friends,\u201d seems intentionally rude. Really think OP is the AH.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been a groomsman in a wedding party close to 10 times. It\u2019s super normal to meet someone else in the wedding party at the wedding, because they couldn\u2019t make other events for budget/travel/family reasons or whatever.", "I think so too. I can understand why both the FSIL and brother would be upset. \n\nThis is the kind of thing that can set your relationship for decades.", "Nta for saying no. But definitely went the AH route in this. A simple text saying your dealing with alot of spousal medical stuff could have sufficed. My assumption is she wanted to take the bridesmaid opportunity to bond and get to know her future SIL better. If you weren't friends then , you probably won't be now lol", "Eeeeh it\u2019s kind of hard. Bride is TA for sure for not taking no for an answer. \nI think it would\u2019ve been better if you hadn\u2019t said \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d I think that might have been a *liiiittle* harsh but other than that I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re in the wrong.

You aren't a rando from the office, you are her family now, ffs. \n\n\nYeah your husband's medical issues sucked and no duh that's going to be the first priority but absolutely do not bullshit the internet by saying taking 10 minutes out of your day to alert Kim of whats going would have been too much. \n\n\nI cant even think of how Kim was being an asshole because all Im thinking if is the rudest SIL ever barging in with no cares about you or one of the biggest moments of your life. No shit her and her friends all freaked out, thats a weird ass bomb to drop on her fucking *engagment party*. I actually cant believe how much Im seeing the words 'flying monkeys' ?? If someone said that shit to my friend at her ENGAGEMENT PARTY??? Dude! What did you think would happen, of course people were offended as hell.\n\n\nYou really didnt think people wouldnt be offended?? Because its the rudest thing to show up to their ENGAGEMENT PARTY while giving no shits about their engagement. Why did you even go at that point??

(She even followed it with a question mark FFS.) I mean I get it. There are just some people you don\u2019t like. But my gut feeling reading this is that it\u2019s some kind of ongoing issue or dynamic with her brother that has forced her to absolutely 100% be the AH in this situation. \n\nBtw, OP, you\u2019re not the AH for not liking her or saying no, but man. You weren\u2019t just rude, you were mean in the way you handled it and, by your own admission, this girl has done nothing to you. I mean, you were literally handed several excuses by the universe in the form of your husband\u2019s emergency, living abroad part time, and having a small child. Just be nice and pick one instead of being adversarial and telling her you don\u2019t owe her an explanation. \n\nHonestly, if I were Kim I\u2019d rescind your invitation altogether.\n\nETA: For everyone saying Kim is an AH too, think about how this interaction began. She was excited to introduce her to the other bridesmaids. Sure, she shouldn\u2019t have assumed no response was a yes, but can you imagine your future husband\u2019s SISTER treating you this way when you clearly just want to include them? She was shocked and embarrassed.", "I think of the two OP is worst", "I definitely picked up on how it seems that according to OP, she is always completely calm and reasonable while Kim \u201csnapped\u201d and freaked out. Whenever someone insists that much that they were totally calm and chill, I kind of assume they were very much not.", "Yeah it actually made me upset and like embarrassed to read OPs post. Anyone who can say that stuff and then type that up is an asshole as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "Yeah the refusal to explain was unnecessarily confrontational and set the tone for what followed. \n\nNot to mention, *calmly* telling someone you don\u2019t owe them an explanation is a complete oxymoron. Doesn\u2019t matter how calm her tone of voice was, what she said was hostile, rude and dismissive. There\u2019s nothing calm about that.", "Yeah OP sounds a little tone deaf.

And at the engagement party you tell her you\u2019re not her friend?  Someone \u201csnapped,\u201d OP, but it sounds like it was you. \n\nThis is one of those post that makes me really question the perspective of the poster. I have a feeling we are getting a skewed account. I can understand the stress of her husbands hospital stay, but recognize you reacted in an over-the-top way and at least apologize for that part.\n\nSorry about your husband, but I agree that ESH.", "Why is it rude to say you\u2019re not friends if you\u2019re not friends? OP didn\u2019t start off with that, but Kim kept pressing. OP is NTA.", "I think it's a YTA not even ESH. Not for declining being a bridesmaid but how OP handled it. \n\nFirst, the entire post kinda drips with condescension. Kim is \"excitable\" OP is calm (and a mother. Did she mention she is a mother? She is a mother.) Kim snaps. And snaps again? Emotional Kim has quite the issue with regulating her emotions when being told something needlessly cruel by the budha-like in her serenity OP.\n\nBut this is just nitpicking. The reason why OP is an asshole is because she had several opportunities to potentially defuse this situation and in every instance chose to wretched up the drama. She didn't respond with an answer right away. Ok fine, understandable. She forgot about it before the engagement party. Alright, medical issues with a loved one can overwhelm. She did not stop Kim from introducing her as a bridesmaid to the rest of her bridal party. Surely this would have been a perfect moment to pull her aside and tell her privately. No, she joined Kim to stand near the rest of the bridesmaids long enough to draw conclusions about how above the whole wedding thing she is. \n\nFinally! Finally, after not taking advantage of at least 3 opportunities to put this to bed in private, OP tells Kim no. Kim asks why. And instead of offering something bland to a question that isn't really that rude, she dials the aggression up to 11 with \"How DARE you question me?\"\n\nAnd then of course the \"we are not friends!\"\n\nI don't know what specific grievance OP has against Kim, but she definitely has one and is acting like a toddler (hmmm....is that where she picked up this approach of conflict resolution?) about it", "Pretty fucking cold to someone you\u2019d like to be on good terms with for **the rest of your lives**.", "\u201cI don\u2019t owe you an explanation\u201d is an outrageously hostile and arrogant thing to say to someone!", "I feel like OP doesn't understand how much pressure some people feel to \"fit in\" with their partners family and being told \"we aren't friends\" is a absolute slap in the face.\n\nHonestly if Kim uninvited her I wouldn't blame her.", "The \u201cshe snapped\u201d really bothered me, and I feel like people this cold will describe almost any uncomfortable emotional reaction as something like \u201csnapping\u201d so I question how reactive Kim actually was. I\u2019ve seen so many people that are more emotionally avoidant/shut down who will take any sign of emotion as being overreactive. But even if if Kim did have the shittiest reaction, still YTA.", "But if you strip away the snarkiness, what will op have left then? /s", "So glad to see someone else mention the package! Of course Kim was going to be hurt after doing that", "I didn\u2019t mention my brother because he\u2019s fairly blameless. He didn\u2019t ask Kim to make me a bridesmaid, and as I told him he should have told her not to ask me when he knew what she was planning but he said he assumed I\u2019d say no and then he wouldn\u2019t have to have a fight with her. Obviously he didn\u2019t anticipate the way it ended up being handled. \n\nMy brother is a good guy, but he\u2019s harder to mail to a wall than custard - he will do *anything* to avoid having to have an opinion because he has to be loved by everyone. Even now, to me he says what I want to hear and I have no doubt he tells Kim the same. I love him to bits but he\u2019ll be no help here.", "I was the best man in a wedding. I have anxiety and when I was asked I had just changed jobs to one that was very stressful and had me constantly at my absolute limit, so I originally tried to decline and gave those reasons since I knew there was no shot I could coordinate the bachelor party or anything like that\u2014I can\u2019t even make an appointment with a contractor until my living room has a waterfall in it, so there was no shot I was going to pull off coordinating an event on the other side of the country with attendees from all over. I was basically told don\u2019t worry about it, I just want you there. If it were anyone else I probably would have still protested but this was someone I genuinely consider more of a brother than either of my actual brothers, so I did it and I would do it again.\n\nSo I get why OP doesn\u2019t want to do it about as much as it\u2019s possible to. But ultimately being a bridesmaid is less of an ask and if the bride wanted her to be one badly enough to argue when she declines, I\u2019m sure she would be willing to make accommodations if she knew her reasons. Instead OP was cold, and then abrasive. Of course, OP is entitled to decline for any reason she wants. But\u2014and maybe this is a hot take, I don\u2019t know\u2014if someone is asking you to be in their wedding party, and you decline, that person absolutely does deserve to know the honest reason why. Now, reading the post I do think she ultimately got the *real* reason; OP gave us XYZ reasons but \u201cI just don\u2019t like you\u201d was the message she gave her FSIL and I think that is the real reason above and beyond any of the other things she listed. And that\u2019s fine, but her delivery was absolutely caustic and there is no part of the FSIL\u2019s emotional response to being torn down like that at her own engagement party that I could ever categorize as AH behavior. It\u2019s an easy YTA.", "Sounds more like a demand than an invitation", "She\u2019s now close family, though. Level of friendship is not super relevant to me when it comes to my in-laws. I put up with them and invite them to things because it\u2019s my husband\u2019s family and they\u2019ve never done anything bad enough to make me cut ties. My SIL was my bridesmaid because I knew it would mean a lot to my husband, *not* because we were friends.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean OP has to accept the invitation, she was well within her right to say no for any reason under the sun.

I have also never been asked to host, plan, or pay for a shower myself as the bride\u2019s family is usually in charge of that.

But, when looking at what OP asked - AITA for saying no to being a bridesmaid - my answer is NTA. If the question was - AITA for saying no to being a bridesmaid and telling the bride that we aren't friends? - yeah, seems like a not so great thing to do. \n\nBut then again, idk. We're all giving the bride a lot of leeway to have a bad reaction because the booze was flowing and it's her wedding and whatever - but like, OP also probably had a couple drinks and said something she might've regretted. I don't like feeling pressured into anything, much less the very tangible time and money it costs to be in someone's wedding, so I can see why it got out of hand.\n\nApologies are needed all around, but I don't think OP is an AH for not wanting to be in the wedding.", "Same. Kim was being a pushy ahole imo and op just matched her energy AFTER trying to be polite.

They\u2019re both your sisters-in-law.", "So your response is incredibly telling on a few levels. \n\nFirst, you refer to him as \u201cblameless\u201d. Blameless? Which sort of implies you think your future SIL should be blamed for wanting you to be in her wedding and/or for being hurt and upset with how you handled it. (Which, sorry, I don\u2019t care how \u201ccalmly\u201d you told her you don\u2019t owe her an explanation, the vast majority of people would look at that as a middle finger, especially from someone who is about to be \u201cfamily\u201d.) Honestly, both are a little mind blowing.\n\nSecondly, whether or not your realize it, your feelings about your brother come through more strongly than you think in this post. I don\u2019t doubt you love him, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like you like (or, more importantly, respect) him that much either. I also don\u2019t know how you\u2019re expecting him the help you, or why you want him to. Your responses are pretty strident. So, if you did nothing wrong, you should be confident in that and not expect him to go against his future wife in what sounds like a genuine and well-intended request on her part to \u201chelp\u201d you do\u2026actually I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re after now. Damage control?\n\nThird, I am not sure you\u2019re actually taking anything anyone is telling you on board based on this response. I think you came here looking for validation and it has mostly backfired. I\u2019m not sure if it has occurred to you yet that that\u2019s because you really were the AH yet though.\n\nThe good news for you is that I doubt this will be a problem going forward. His future wife will not want to waste anymore of your time or hers on this relationship and, being the pleaser he is, he\u2019s not going to push back. She will win all of these battles going forward and you probably won\u2019t have to have much to do with either one of them. Happy wife, happy life and all of that.", "Maybe to discuss with husband? You know, like mature couples do.", "Damn bc other parts of life are more important? It's low-priority for her, so she treated it like one. Kim could have easily checked in instead of being wrapped up in her fantasy.

OP really fails at communication.\n\nEditing to add: Having experienced a family medical emergency in the past year that involved a hospitalization and a surgery--there is a ton of downtime where you are just waiting around for test results, for the doctor to update you, and the patient is sleeping.

A) she's going to be in your life forever, it's just common courtesy to at least explain a little bit before you shut her down on something that is once in a lifetime, and B) again her asking you to be a bridesmaid is a really nice gesture, and it shows that even if you don't, she sees you as a friend. By telling her that you AREN'T friends... you pretty much told her you don't want to be friends with her. Especially given the heated context of the conversation, it was a really mean thing to say.

I don't think it's rude or pushy to be friendly and inquire.", "It\u2019s pretty common for people to ask their SO\u2019s siblings to be apart of their wedding party.

It seems totally reasonable to me that if Kim is trying to build a relationship with OP that she'd ask why OP is saying no to see if she could resolve the issues rather than risking resentment for not trying & their apparently very different communication styles may be part of the reason why OP dislikes her.", "We don\u2019t really know that she got angry.

Would doing 1-2 days of bridesmaid duties really be that awful for someone who is joining your family? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m petty like this but I was FSIL, I would invite your husband and not you because \u201cI understand how busy you are and how much of a burden attending would be for you.\u201d\n\nAlso, she \u201csnapped\u201d and you \u201ccalmly explained\u201d\u2026 in the most condescending way possible.

It\u2019s very common to have a sister in law as a bridesmaid at a wedding and vice versus. While they aren\u2019t close this could be an opportunity to bring them closer. It seems like no effort has been made by OP at all in this. A wedding in a family is so exciting and important and OP is making it out like it isn\u2019t. The brides emotional reaction is warranted and Ops response of \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d made it way worse", "YTA. Yes, your circumstances were difficult but there was zero reason to be so cruel to the bride. Also, were you \u201efriends\u201c with the husband\u2018s employee that you threw a wedding for?

You thought your husband would die but your FSIL and brother had no clue? C\u2019mon. There was zero tact in that situation. All you did was make your FSIL feel like shit and if she is anything like a lot of women I know- especially if she went through a WHOLE LOT of effort to make those boxes- then she probably thinks that her new husbands family doesn\u2019t actually like her- not just you. You come off as just mean.", "I understand that you had priority with your husband being in the hospital but I absolutely don't agree with saying that she wasn't your friend.

Did your husband's company pay for any part of the employee's wedding?\n\nBut you tell your future sister-in-law that you don't even consider her to be a friend, and you're not obligated to tell her why you don't want to be a bridesmaid. That's pretty cold-hearted. \n\nYTA", "You sound a bit mean. Her asking is a sweet gesture, and you are free to say no, but she is also free to feel hurt about it.

You could have handled it in a million other ways. We\u2019re not friends?? Really?? This woman is making an effort and is obviously hoping to have more of a relationship with you now that she\u2019s going to be part of your family. You are under zero obligation to be in her wedding party, but you could have explained it in a much kinder way. I would highly recommend apologizing for being rude and explaining everything you explained in this post- you are going to have to see this woman at family events for maybe the rest of your life- it would really suck if it was awkward because you declared you\u2019re not her friend.", "YTA big time.\nBased on your OP, your description of her and your comments, you seem to be TA in general.

Her yelling was extra obviously, but you should\u2019ve told her way sooner than you did, and at a party is especially bad form. I get your husband got sick, but why even wait in the first place? \n\nAs far as refusing to explain yourself, that feels pretty childish imo. Obviously you don\u2019t HAVE to tell her. But if someone invites you to be part of their wedding and you say nothing at all for a week, then suddenly reveal that you cant aka won\u2019t, I feel like they deserve an explanation? Id for sure want one. And the \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d comment is just nasty, considering you yourself say she\u2019s never actually done anything wrong.

It's pretty uncommon to announce the bridesmaids/groomsmen at the engagement party.

Well, the relationship to her SIL is ruined forever now. But then, it doesn't seem like she cares.
