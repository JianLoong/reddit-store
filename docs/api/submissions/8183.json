One day it's my wife and I, the next time is my sister and her boyfriend, the next my mom and dad, and then finally my grandmother. With our busy lives, this day is important to us because besides holidays, we wouldn't be able to meet up and chat or eat without it.\n\nWe come from an Italian family but are in Canada (my mom was born there, I was here). I take my food very seriously, especially Italian food, and double especially because my nonna is eating with us.\n\nI spent all day preparing dinner and when we sat down to eat, my sister's boyfriend is humming and hawing saying my meal is missing something. He said he needs hot sauce and starts walking to my fridge. All I have is Franks and Sriracha. I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that.\n\nSo I stopped him saying I'd appreciate if he enjoyed my meal as it is. He said it's no big deal, and in a way it isn't, but also in many ways it is. I told him at the very least, I have some Calabrian chili oil he can use, or dried chili flakes. Then it would at least still be Italian. He insists on Sriracha, and I declined him.\n\nHe escalated it and said he was going to go to the store and buy his own bottle and return if that's the case, and I said by all means. He left, we finished up dinner, and we called it an early night. Everyone is putting their coat and shoes on as he returns, and he's pissed.\n\nWas I TA? My sister is on my side if it matters, but this has been a fight all day yesterday between them because he wants my sister on his side, not mine. They've been dating only 3 months.\n\nedit: if it matters, I made carbonara, bruschetta, and then for mains which he didn't get to yet, was a seafood platter in red sauce. My wife and I are 34, 35 respectively, my sister and boyfriend are 23, 22 respectively.", "created_utc": 1674594547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kgbuo/aita_for_not_letting_my_sisters_boyfriend_use_hot/", "score": 1302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I made a concession to compromise and suggested adding chili oil or flakes, something you normally wouldn't do in Italy, but I gave in a little.

Your glorification of the supposed hard rules of dishes that were developed from whatever people had access to in a country that youre generations removed from is dumb.

Adding a condiment to your dish would have made it more enjoyable for him, and you declined him because you \"take food seriously.\" He wasn't going to put hot sauce on everyone's food.

You make a bland meal and prevent people from making additions? Do you control the salt and pepper too?", "YTA.

Would you have rather he eat it and not enjoy it?", "YTA - can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s. You sound childish. Let people eat however and whatever they like.

You were a poor host and rude.", "YTA. italian here. as painful as it sounds to eat hot sauce with those foods, just let the man do what he wants. it\u2019s his food. it\u2019s not like he was mixing it into the meal and everyone had to eat it with hot sauce.", "YTA.

The man can cook, I\u2019m sure you know how it is he makes everything himself and prides himself on it-as he absolutely should! Any of my friends I\u2019ve ever brought for dinner says he makes the best food. I also love hot sauce. So much so I got a hot sauce tattoo! \nYou\u2019re not an asshole for asking him to try it as is or for offering him chilli flakes/oil. However you ARE an asshole for the absolutely absurdly pretentious way you wrote this/spoke to your sisters boyfriend. People like different things. Maybe you\u2019re not as good of a cook as you think you are. The whole bUt I\u2019m ItaLiAn~ thing makes you sound pompous and honestly insufferable.

There's nothing as annoying as an American - in this case a Canadian - who gets all fanatical on being Super Italian (tm) to compensate for the fact that they're not.\n\nAs an actual Italian from Italy I can tell you, being an annoying snob about food is ridiculous and conceited. We don't monitor what people put in their plate like it's some kind of slight to the souls of our ancestors.

It\u2019s like a person wanting their steak medium and you cooking it rare and making them eat it since that\u2019s how you say it should be eaten.", "YTA. That sounds like an unusual flavor pairing but why do you care?", "YTA", "YTA. I get that you spent time and effort to make the meal. He's got to eat it. Let him eat it the way he wants. Do you tell all of your guests how they are allowed to season their food when they visit?", "YTA. Who gives a shit? If he likes hot sauce on his food, then let him put hot sauce on it. You don\u2019t have to eat it that way. My mom puts maple syrup on specific dish and I think it\u2019s sacrilege, but I\u2019m not her.

Period.", "Bro. \n\nJust let people eat their damn food. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. By the way for all your concern about \"mixing cuisines\" keep in mind that tomatoes weren't a part of Italian cuisine until the 1600s. Good thing that people back then weren't like you or there would be no red sauce.", "YTA \nThis whole time I thought the memes about Italians being weird about how people eat and make pasta was a joke. You just proved me wrong.", "YTA. Let people enjoy their food how they want! You made it into a giant thing for no reason.", "What a weird hill to die on OP.

Chill. It's hot sauce.\n\nHowever, I feel like the boyfriend's comment \"Something is missing\" is pretty rude on his part. All he'd have to ask say is that he prefers his food spicy; critiquing the meal was uncalled for. I'm also pretty baffled by his insisting on going to the store to purchase hot sauce. That's just absurd. You'd think of hot sauce were such a priority, he'd keep it in his back pocket or something.\n\nHonestly, you both sound exhausting, and I feel bad for your sister.", "YTA\n\nUnless he was putting it on everyone's/your portion, why would you imagine you had any right to say how he seasoned his food?", "YTA. You claim that you\u2019re in some way protecting your \u201cculture\u201d by being rude to a guest in your home.

I promise you that is reason enough. Sincerely an Italian who freehands all their recipes and also will literally die if they eat wheat.", "YTA 100%. I'm a chef, and even I'm not that anal about what dumb shit people do to my food. I might give them a ribbing over it, but outright refusing??

A horrible host.", "YTA.\n\n\nI feel like it's more your pride getting in the way here and feeling insulted than it being 100% about the dishes not mixing. \n\n\nJust because something doesn't mix on a compatible level doesn't mean someone else can't enjoy it. I'd understand your being upset if he went and put the sauce in or on everyone's stuff, but that's not the case. \n\n\nA good rule of thumb to find out if your an ass in a situation is \"What would of happened if I didn't do that?\" and in this case your guests would of been happy.", "YTA... I mean get over yourself is all I cam say.", "YTA. You made such a huge deal out of nothing. Who tf cares what condiments he wants to use?", "YTA dictating how people eat their meal is a bit insane.", "YTA \n\nDude- everyone has different pallets. He did escalate things when saying \"i'm just gonna go buy my own!\" but it shouldn't have even gotten there to begin with. You are very condescending bringing age into the discussion as well. Are 20-something people are \"less adult and sophisticated\" than 30-something people? It's not age, it's how you act and you started an argument that didn't need to exist.", "YTA he was only putting it on his plate. He's the one eating it so why can't he add to it if he wants?", "YTA. Who cares if he puts hot sauce on his food? What if you put salt and pepper on something he cooked and he told you that you could not? I understand taking pride in your food and the cultural significance, but people should be able to enjoy their food how they wish. When I cook for people, even Armenian cuisine that is very special to me, I don't care if they request hot sauce or whatever. When my BIL joined our family, he didn't like everything and added ketchup to whatever and we had a laugh about it. We didn't tell him no, you can't do that. It's not an insult, your sister's bf just wanted some hot sauce. I wouldn't eat at your house if you didn't allow me to enjoy my food. If it's such a big deal in your family, then maybe your sister should have explained to him after the meal instead of humiliating him for wanting a condiment. Not everyone understands why that might be considered rude in some families. Why would you also not care if he brought his own? He would still be mixing cuisines and messing with your cooking.", "YTA for taking it too far. For family, I usually request one bite and then sauce/salt/whatever after that.

His plate did not affect your plate in any way.  It didn't affect your nonna's plate in anyway.  All she saw was you being an ungracious host.  The correct thing would have been to offer him whatever array of spicy condiments you had available.\n\nAlso, define Italian food.  Italy in particular has an incredibly diverse culinary history due to its place on trade routes and the Roman empire.  You got tomatoes and chocolate from South America via Spain.  You know, the same cultures that use hot sauce regularly.  Bread and wine came from the Greeks.  Hope you didn't have any of those.  It sounds like your understanding of Italian food is what can be found at the Olive Garden.

If that sounds ridiculous, please note that is how you sound right now.", "YTA, you can stop clutching your pearls about \"daring to mix cuisines\" anytime.

Could be that he didn\u2019t actually like the food and wanted to cover it up to make it palatable without telling everyone he hated it.

Yes. The food was not inedible without hot sauce. Were you the asshole for declining him hot sauce when he was so insistent, and making him leave to go find cuisine-conforming hot sauce to eat his meal? Also yes. You had sriracha, which was fine with him. Just let him use it, it's not that deep.

One day it's my wife and I, the next time is my sister and her boyfriend, the next my mom and dad, and then finally my grandmother. With our busy lives, this day is important to us because besides holidays, we wouldn't be able to meet up and chat or eat without it.\n\nWe come from an Italian family but are in Canada (my mom was born there, I was here). I take my food very seriously, especially Italian food, and double especially because my nonna is eating with us.\n\nI spent all day preparing dinner and when we sat down to eat, my sister's boyfriend is humming and hawing saying my meal is missing something. He said he needs hot sauce and starts walking to my fridge. All I have is Franks and Sriracha. I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that.\n\nSo I stopped him saying I'd appreciate if he enjoyed my meal as it is. He said it's no big deal, and in a way it isn't, but also in many ways it is. I told him at the very least, I have some Calabrian chili oil he can use, or dried chili flakes. Then it would at least still be Italian. He insists on Sriracha, and I declined him.\n\nHe escalated it and said he was going to go to the store and buy his own bottle and return if that's the case, and I said by all means. He left, we finished up dinner, and we called it an early night. Everyone is putting their coat and shoes on as he returns, and he's pissed.\n\nWas I TA? My sister is on my side if it matters, but this has been a fight all day yesterday between them because he wants my sister on his side, not mine. They've been dating only 3 months.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP is definitely the AH. It\u2019s gatekeeping really.", "The op sounds so pretentious. Let him drench his food in hot sauce if that\u2019s what he wants, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s eating his plate.", "I will say I don't like it when a hot sauce fiend won't at least taste my cooking first. I put a lot into my cooking. If someone still wants it after a taste? I'm totally fine with it, I just appreciate when someone tries what I made on its own.\n\nObviously op is still an ah because the bf tasted it and still wanted it, but just adding a viewpoint why someone might care in general.", "I agree with this. I will validate that it kinda hurts when you've worked really hard on a meal for someone and there's one person who insists on smothering it with ketchup or hot sauce. Still. You have to just get over this and not take it personally. Roll your eyes internally and offer up the hot sauce. You aren't the expert on someone else's food preferences.", "The thread on this comment is driving me crazy. Yes, OP had a weird controlling reaction, but the boyfriend didn\u2019t just ask for hot sauce. Saying \u201cthis meal is missing something\u201d about food that was made for you as a guest is an extraordinarily rude comment to make. If someone said this about a meal I spent all day making, that is presumably a family recipe, it would probably make me cry.", "As someone who keeps hot sauce in my car (because it recently exploded inside the purse I usually keep it in) I agree 100%.", "Have you never seen \"To Kill A Mockingbird\"?

Even in the explanation he holds his Italian heritage over the bf and anyone else as this holier than thou attitude and that\u2019s supposed to make his behavior ok?", "Yeah neither of you are Italian", "I call them \u201cEye-talians.\u201d They\u2019ve likely never set a foot in Italy, some only have very watered-down knowledge or traditions that Italians in Italy don\u2019t share, but they can\u2019t shut up about how Italian they are.", "For real lol does OP know where tomatoes and pasta came from?", "Not to mention Sriracha is chili peppers, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and salt... None of those items would \"cLaSh\" with Italian food lmao", "\\^This. I have a friend who puts hot sauce on EVERYTHING. Ramen Noodles, Bagels, the occasional ice cream, you name it. Is it weird? Hell yes. Do I make fun of her? Yes (she makes fun of me too its fine shhhh). Do I gatekeep her from putting hot sauce on food I make? No! Because I can't tell her what she can/cannot put on her food. \n\nYou're the asshole for policing what he can and cannot put on his food, even if you made it. He's the asshole for saying \"Something is missing\" & up & leaving to get his own hot sauce when you denied him yours. \n\nESH.", "Yeah, I think too many people are overlooking the boyfriends actions here. The boyfriend made an insulting comment about the food, got up to start foraging around, and then left the dinner entirely to get hot sauce. Totally atrocious table manners. \n\nAll you gotta say is, do you have some hot sauce? ESH is the right judgement.", "Yeah I think I\u2019m leaning toward ESH. Cuz the bf was rude but OP was a bit controlling. Still, if I was the OP, I\u2019d just accept the chili flakes. I love spicy food and chili flakes on Italian food is bomb AF lol", "Ketchup on scrambled eggs is the best lol", "Er the boyfriend probably went to the store on an emotional level on principle because OP said they could do that if they wanted to.", "Ketsup on fried eggs is heavenly", "Not enough people use the ESH option. Your completely right.  Op is an ass for insisting someone can\u2019t have food how they want it. The boyfriend is an ass for throwing a fit and leaving the meal for to go get a specific hot sauce.", "In my country it\u2019s impolite to ask the host for something that isn\u2019t already on the table. And especially trying to take something yourself from their fridge. You eat, if you don\u2019t like it you just say you\u2019re full and you thank them for the meal. This guy sounds like an entitled ass. And what, everyone was supposed to sit and wait for him while he was at the store and not eat?

It's a standard request in any NYC deli when you get a breakfast sandwich.\n\nHeck, I used to like it too, although now I prefer...hot sauce!", "I know a woman named Hillary who keeps hot sauce in her purse.", "Blimey... it's practically the law to have mint sauce on your lamb in Britain. You would be judged harshly for not wanting it... something along the lines of, \"No mint sauce??? What are you??? A fucking vegan????\"...", "Yes. This extends to maybe laughing at him behind his back for adding sriracha to what OP clearly thinks is a pitch perfect carbonara. Preventing him from eating it how he wants is horrible hosting.", "Also franks red hot tastes really really good in white sauce. You cook it in the sauce and some of the vinegar evaporates away and it leaves a really nice flavour. \n\nThe trick is to add it when the sauce is still a little loose but not too loose or it gets all gross and (I think) the vinegar interacts with the milk and makes curds.", "Good rule of thumb", "Not to mention that the bottle of sriracha literally lists \"pasta\" and \"sauces\" in addition to \"or on anything\" for recommended uses. :) Sriracha wouldn't be my first choice for carbonara but I'd also be pissed if someone stopped me from using it, AT HOME no less. \n\nDid you read his explanation below the original post? About \"looking at it from an Italian perspective\"? I bet the dude's never even been to Italy. It's even worse than his attitude in the original post. OP is pretentious AF.", "While Italian food in Italy or at restaurants is usually good, the vast majority I've had made by the children of immigrants in North America at someone's home or a dinner party is bland as fuck, so this tracks.", "I really don't get the \"daring to mix cuisines\". Best restaurant I know is Jamaican/Japanese fusion. \n\nAnd generally, every accomplished chef would tell you that mixing cuisines is a great thing.", "I can\u2019t begin to imagine a Michelin chef not accommodating to a request from a specific palate.

I usually pick (Indonesian) sambal for that purpose.", "One of my best friends adds several condiments to everything he eats. And he adds a lot. I love to cook, people love my food and I think the food is better without the stuff he adds. Still, I keep inviting him for dinner, putting the condiments he prefers on the table.

I wanted salsa lol", "100%. It is rude for someone to basically try to remake a dish when someone else is hosting (and putting sriracha on carbonara is essentially remaking the dish). At the same time, seems like a dumb hill to die on/bad choice to disrupt the whole meal over. It had the chance to be something the family laughed over down the road, whether or not the guy stayed in the picture. \"Remember when you/that guy put hot sauce on your/his carbonara???\" Now, it's just a source of tension.", "Who gatekeeps food. So weird.", "I believe just his own", "For sure noting his rudeness and keeping it to yourself is the classy way to go, but needing hot sauce so much that you leave to go buy your own and expect everyone to wait to finish eating until you come back, a family of someone you've only been dating three months, is an absurd level of bratty entitlement", "Chef could have six stars and you still might like your tiny expensive dish with an extra pinch of pepper because you're in a spicy mood.", "Being Hispanic, we put spicy stuff on everything.

I love it and it's so fitting for this post.\n\nNever yuck someone else's yum!!", "Leaving to buy your own ingredient is epicly rude. They both sucked but he sucked more. Imo. But my husband is the kind of chef that seems to feel even adding salt to a plated dish is insulting.", "Bf wouldn't had to of left if op was not being an AH over hot sauce in the first place though. People have different tastes and there is nothing wrong with it at all. Bf said he needed spice, Op said no and was being rude to a guest which caused said guest to leave.", "Finally, an ESH vote. \n\nI couldn't picture being a guest in someone's home, especially in front of their grandparents and insisting on hot sauce. I have even terrible things as a guest and didn't complain. \n\nIt would be different if this were another family member and they were subjected to many meals but for one dinner?
