One day it's my wife and I, the next time is my sister and her boyfriend, the next my mom and dad, and then finally my grandmother. With our busy lives, this day is important to us because besides holidays, we wouldn't be able to meet up and chat or eat without it.\n\nWe come from an Italian family but are in Canada (my mom was born there, I was here). I take my food very seriously, especially Italian food, and double especially because my nonna is eating with us.\n\nI spent all day preparing dinner and when we sat down to eat, my sister's boyfriend is humming and hawing saying my meal is missing something. He said he needs hot sauce and starts walking to my fridge. All I have is Franks and Sriracha. I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that.\n\nSo I stopped him saying I'd appreciate if he enjoyed my meal as it is. He said it's no big deal, and in a way it isn't, but also in many ways it is. I told him at the very least, I have some Calabrian chili oil he can use, or dried chili flakes. Then it would at least still be Italian. He insists on Sriracha, and I declined him.\n\nHe escalated it and said he was going to go to the store and buy his own bottle and return if that's the case, and I said by all means. He left, we finished up dinner, and we called it an early night. Everyone is putting their coat and shoes on as he returns, and he's pissed.\n\nWas I TA? My sister is on my side if it matters, but this has been a fight all day yesterday between them because he wants my sister on his side, not mine. They've been dating only 3 months.\n\nedit: if it matters, I made carbonara, bruschetta, and then for mains which he didn't get to yet, was a seafood platter in red sauce. My wife and I are 34, 35 respectively, my sister and boyfriend are 23, 22 respectively.", "created_utc": 1674594547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kgbuo/aita_for_not_letting_my_sisters_boyfriend_use_hot/", "score": 11646, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I made a concession to compromise and suggested adding chili oil or flakes, something you normally wouldn't do in Italy, but I gave in a little.

Your glorification of the supposed hard rules of dishes that were developed from whatever people had access to in a country that youre generations removed from is dumb.

Adding a condiment to your dish would have made it more enjoyable for him, and you declined him because you \"take food seriously.\" He wasn't going to put hot sauce on everyone's food.

Would you have rather he eat it and not enjoy it?", "YTA - can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s. You sound childish. Let people eat however and whatever they like.

If it makes them happy and everyone has a good time, well, that was the whole purpose anyways.\nBut you made it a much bigger deal and if I was the BF, I would treat you poorly in the future and probably harras you.\nAre you putting cheese on that?

The man can cook, I\u2019m sure you know how it is he makes everything himself and prides himself on it-as he absolutely should! Any of my friends I\u2019ve ever brought for dinner says he makes the best food. I also love hot sauce. So much so I got a hot sauce tattoo! \nYou\u2019re not an asshole for asking him to try it as is or for offering him chilli flakes/oil. However you ARE an asshole for the absolutely absurdly pretentious way you wrote this/spoke to your sisters boyfriend. People like different things. Maybe you\u2019re not as good of a cook as you think you are. The whole bUt I\u2019m ItaLiAn~ thing makes you sound pompous and honestly insufferable.

There's nothing as annoying as an American - in this case a Canadian - who gets all fanatical on being Super Italian (tm) to compensate for the fact that they're not.\n\nAs an actual Italian from Italy I can tell you, being an annoying snob about food is ridiculous and conceited. We don't monitor what people put in their plate like it's some kind of slight to the souls of our ancestors.

That sounds like an unusual flavor pairing but why do you care?", "YTA", "YTA. I get that you spent time and effort to make the meal. He's got to eat it. Let him eat it the way he wants. Do you tell all of your guests how they are allowed to season their food when they visit?", "YTA. Who gives a shit? If he likes hot sauce on his food, then let him put hot sauce on it. You don\u2019t have to eat it that way. My mom puts maple syrup on specific dish and I think it\u2019s sacrilege, but I\u2019m not her.

Period.", "Bro. \n\nJust let people eat their damn food. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. By the way for all your concern about \"mixing cuisines\" keep in mind that tomatoes weren't a part of Italian cuisine until the 1600s. Good thing that people back then weren't like you or there would be no red sauce.", "YTA \nThis whole time I thought the memes about Italians being weird about how people eat and make pasta was a joke. You just proved me wrong.", "YTA. Let people enjoy their food how they want! You made it into a giant thing for no reason.", "What a weird hill to die on OP. YTA.", "ESH.\n\nPolicing how someone likes their food is a bad look. My husband likes ketchup on his scrambled eggs; I think he must have a demon whispering lies into his ear. But that's his right to let the demon lead him astray. \n\n>I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that\n\nYou say this like you think you'll also invite a demon into your home. Chill. It's hot sauce.\n\nHowever, I feel like the boyfriend's comment \"Something is missing\" is pretty rude on his part. All he'd have to ask say is that he prefers his food spicy; critiquing the meal was uncalled for. I'm also pretty baffled by his insisting on going to the store to purchase hot sauce. That's just absurd. You'd think of hot sauce were such a priority, he'd keep it in his back pocket or something.\n\nHonestly, you both sound exhausting, and I feel bad for your sister.\n\nEdit: Y'all, I'm well aware that ketchup on eggs is common. I just think it's evidence of demons on earth and that God has forsaken us all. And yet, I'd offer ketchup to my guests, since I don't discuss religion at the breakfast table.", "YTA\n\nUnless he was putting it on everyone's/your portion, why would you imagine you had any right to say how he seasoned his food?", "YTA. You claim that you\u2019re in some way protecting your \u201cculture\u201d by being rude to a guest in your home.

You don't need to make up pretentious generalizations, you can just say it's important to you and your family personally that your family recipies be eaten as they were prepared for you growing up. I promise you that is reason enough. Sincerely an Italian who freehands all their recipes and also will literally die if they eat wheat.", "YTA 100%. I'm a chef, and even I'm not that anal about what dumb shit people do to my food. I might give them a ribbing over it, but outright refusing??

I'd understand your being upset if he went and put the sauce in or on everyone's stuff, but that's not the case. \n\n\nA good rule of thumb to find out if your an ass in a situation is \"What would of happened if I didn't do that?\" and in this case your guests would of been happy.", "YTA... I mean get over yourself is all I cam say.", "YTA. You made such a huge deal out of nothing. Who tf cares what condiments he wants to use?", "YTA dictating how people eat their meal is a bit insane.", "YTA \n\nDude- everyone has different pallets. He did escalate things when saying \"i'm just gonna go buy my own!\" but it shouldn't have even gotten there to begin with. You are very condescending bringing age into the discussion as well. Are 20-something people are \"less adult and sophisticated\" than 30-something people? It's not age, it's how you act and you started an argument that didn't need to exist.", "YTA he was only putting it on his plate. He's the one eating it so why can't he add to it if he wants?", "YTA. Who cares if he puts hot sauce on his food? What if you put salt and pepper on something he cooked and he told you that you could not? I understand taking pride in your food and the cultural significance, but people should be able to enjoy their food how they wish. When I cook for people, even Armenian cuisine that is very special to me, I don't care if they request hot sauce or whatever. When my BIL joined our family, he didn't like everything and added ketchup to whatever and we had a laugh about it. We didn't tell him no, you can't do that. It's not an insult, your sister's bf just wanted some hot sauce. I wouldn't eat at your house if you didn't allow me to enjoy my food. If it's such a big deal in your family, then maybe your sister should have explained to him after the meal instead of humiliating him for wanting a condiment. Not everyone understands why that might be considered rude in some families. Why would you also not care if he brought his own? He would still be mixing cuisines and messing with your cooking.", "YTA for taking it too far. For family, I usually request one bite and then sauce/salt/whatever after that.

His plate did not affect your plate in any way.  It didn't affect your nonna's plate in anyway.  All she saw was you being an ungracious host.  The correct thing would have been to offer him whatever array of spicy condiments you had available.\n\nAlso, define Italian food.  Italy in particular has an incredibly diverse culinary history due to its place on trade routes and the Roman empire.  You got tomatoes and chocolate from South America via Spain.  You know, the same cultures that use hot sauce regularly.  Bread and wine came from the Greeks.  Hope you didn't have any of those.  It sounds like your understanding of Italian food is what can be found at the Olive Garden.

One day it's my wife and I, the next time is my sister and her boyfriend, the next my mom and dad, and then finally my grandmother. With our busy lives, this day is important to us because besides holidays, we wouldn't be able to meet up and chat or eat without it.\n\nWe come from an Italian family but are in Canada (my mom was born there, I was here). I take my food very seriously, especially Italian food, and double especially because my nonna is eating with us.\n\nI spent all day preparing dinner and when we sat down to eat, my sister's boyfriend is humming and hawing saying my meal is missing something. He said he needs hot sauce and starts walking to my fridge. All I have is Franks and Sriracha. I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that.\n\nSo I stopped him saying I'd appreciate if he enjoyed my meal as it is. He said it's no big deal, and in a way it isn't, but also in many ways it is. I told him at the very least, I have some Calabrian chili oil he can use, or dried chili flakes. Then it would at least still be Italian. He insists on Sriracha, and I declined him.\n\nHe escalated it and said he was going to go to the store and buy his own bottle and return if that's the case, and I said by all means. He left, we finished up dinner, and we called it an early night. Everyone is putting their coat and shoes on as he returns, and he's pissed.\n\nWas I TA? My sister is on my side if it matters, but this has been a fight all day yesterday between them because he wants my sister on his side, not mine.

It's fine. \n\nJust yesterday I made a nice Lemon garlic pepper chicken breast, with cherry tomatoes, cooked in wine. It was delicious. \nAll of my family did different things. \nSome ate it as is, some added butter or salt to it, and my father in law asked for some ranch to add to his. So I walked to the fridge and grabbed the ranch. I thought it was a little strange of a combo, but that's what he wanted. It didn't offend me, dude just likes ranch on his chicken. \n\nMaybe it's because I have some empathy, because I have sensory issues and trouble with food textures and tastes sometimes, something I've struggled with my entire life. If altering a dish slightly makes someone happier with their meal, then more power to them. \n\nI will agree that the boyfriends comment was a little rude \"it's missing something\". But just asking outright for hot sauce shouldn't upset someone so much. \n\nHell, even my father in law that had ranch on his chicken still said it was a delicious meal and complimented my cooking, which he does every time I cook for them. \n\nI'm gonna say OP is YTA.", "My husband once put ranch on eggs.
