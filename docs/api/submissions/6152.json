On Christmas day, my whole family was over at my parents' house. My older son has a history of letting his emotions run away with him and hubby and I have been working with him to manage his emotions when that happens. On Christmas day, the kiddo got upset and was starting to spiral. Hubby and I were talking with him to manage it and my father (75M) tried to insert himself into the situation. Both my hubby and I asked nicely and calmly for him to back off multiple times and were ignored. Finally, hubby snapped at my father and told him stop talking and let us handle it. We got the situation under control and the rest of the morning went fine, or so it seemed.\n\nWhen we were getting ready to leave, my father pulled me into the living room to \"have a conversation.\" His idea of a \"conversation\" turned out to be snarling at me, looming over me (I am 5'4\", he is 6'1\") ranting about the incident, saying that if hubby ever gave him an \"order\" like that again, he'd throw my husband out of the house. He went on the tirade of, \"you don\"t speak to another adult like that, especially not your FIL, and not in your FIL's own house\", etc. He wouldn't let me say anything until I tried to leave twice, then let me say my piece and dismissed my point of view and tried to keep fighting. I tried to validate his feelings and leave and he wouldn't let me. I finally told him, \"I AM leaving, because if I don't I'm going to start screaming at crying at you and I don't want that today.\" I left and was shaking and on the brink of tears the whole drive home.\n\nHis behavior was almost identical to how he acted towards me as a child, looming over me, making very intimidating angry faces, etc. As I have grown and done self reflection, I  have realized that I have spent the majority of my life walking on eggshells around him and trying to manage his emotions. I'm trying to get better at setting healthy boundaries. \n\nMy younger son's birthday is January 2, so my mom (78F) texted me a few days after Christmas to ask what the plans were to celebrate. I told her, probably the same low key thing we've done the last couple of years. I'll bring him over to get his present and visit for a while and then we'll do dinner with hubbys's family the weekend after. I followed my text up with another one saying that, in light of the incident on Christmas, a neutral location like a fast food place would probably be better.\n\nI've had a text exchange with my mom about how I felt about the incident and she's stuck herself in the middle and has claimed that my father has also been upset by all this, but I have not had one peep out of him. My mom has said that they're both worried that I am going to keep my kids away from them over this even though I've only asked for another location. \n\nSo, AITA for asking to meet somewhere other than my parents' house?\n\nUPDATE: I told my mom I was going to let my son pick between 3 fast food places that are roughly halfway between our two homes day of, but did set a time. I just got a reply that my parents have been talking about the plan and were wondering if it is really a good idea since both father and I are still upset. She thinks the encounter will be unpleasantly awkward and has offered to instead drive to my house and have her give my son his gift at the door.\n\nI should note that my mom shattered her knee and is currently in a brace and using a walker until she can see a surgeon.\n\nUPDATE 2: I asked what sort of expectations \nfor resolution my father had and was told that my parents think that a family counseling session might help each of us to understand where the other is coming from.\n\nUPDATE 3: We did family counseling when I was younger and it didn't really stick with with him. I asked my mom what my dad would want for resolution other than counseling. She said that he wanted to be told that his feeling of being disrespected at the time was valid. I had acknowledged his feelings at the time and he clearly didn't hear me. I asked if he was even willing to ATTEMPT a conversation with me directly or if he was going to keep my mom in the middle and was told that she didn't know. I stated that am not going to initiate a conversation with him because the last interaction we had involved him threatening my husband and him trying to physically intimidate me, but I am willing to try to talk.", "created_utc": 1672525101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1005595/aita_for_asking_to_meet_my_parents_at_a_neutral/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your kids should not be abused the same way you were. \n\nTable celebrations from now and decide to get some therapy for yourself to process what your childhood was actually like and what kinds of boundaries need to be set with your dad before you see him again. He needs to agree to certain parameters of civil behavior and apologize for his actions before you reward him with grandkid time.\n\nNTA but I would take a different course of action entirely.", "NTA.  They should be worried about you keeping the children from them.  Your father was not being a good grandfather and has a lot to answer for as a father.  Wow.  I\u2019m sorry you had such a stressful childhood. \n\nTrust your instincts.  Your father was abusive towards you and you need to protect yourself and your children from that.  Your husband had every right to tell him off - you two are in charge of raising your son, nobody else, no matter who they are.  I\u2019m sure you know all of these things, but keep reminding yourself, especially when your father gets aggressive.\n\nUntil you are confident that your father isn\u2019t going to have these abusive outbursts, none of you should be at his house.  Who knows how long that will be, but if that\u2019s what you have to do to avoid abuse, do it!\n\nAlso, therapy!  I hope your father gets it but I\u2019m guessing he probably thinks this isn\u2019t a him problem.  But, it sounds like you can use it to process the trauma in your childhood and, as you said, setting healthy boundaries and continuing that healthy self reflection.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck and I\u2019m so sorry you are stuck in such an ugly situation.", "NTA. Protect your kid from him. What he did was not cool, and if he wants to talk about what adults should be doing, intimidating your own family members sure isn\u2019t on the list. \n\nPeople with a lack of respect for boundaries and a quick temper will not help your son learn how to grapple with his emotions, it will make everything so much harder.", "I would forego allowing them to participate period. I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nMy mom used to chastise my parenting. She would get angry with me for trying to discipline my kids, and when I told her anything, she would shut down on me and would make me feel guilty. I would beg and plead her to talk to me because I was conditioned by my mother to believe that I needed her approval to feel validated. \n\nShe told me that I was a bad parent for even disciplining my kids whenever they did wrong. She\u2019d yell at me and my husband for punishing them for bad behavior, and it caused tension in our relationship to the point to where my husband resented my mom for a while.\n\n*That was until I put my foot down.*\n\nI was abused my entire life from childhood and even throughout my first marriage. It wasn\u2019t until I started therapy and started getting treated for my PTSD that my confidence grew and I actually developed a backbone. The rose colored glasses broke away and I finally recognized my mother\u2019s manipulative, toxic, gaslighting behavior for what it was, and I finally learned how to push back and stood my ground. \n\n**I gave her an ultimatum:** *you start respecting me, you respect my parenting, or you will never see your grandkids again.*\n\nI started arguing back every time she chastised me or insulted my parenting. If I was at her house, I started walking out without saying a word and would pack my kids into the car and would leave. If she belittled me through text, I\u2019d shut it down by telling her that I wasn\u2019t going to listen to it. If she started berating me over the phone, I started hanging up on her and didn\u2019t contact her until she decided to work on her behavior.\n\nIt worked. My mom completely changed, and we have a better relationship now. \n\nSometimes you have to show people that you are not afraid to lose them if they don\u2019t want to make the effort to change.

He had every right to his feelings about being snapped at and mention it to you, but not physically intimidate you over it.

You don't need counselling: you handled this situation maturely, and with care for all involved. Your father needs to learn (at 75!) that not everything he says or does is the correct thing, and if he can't you need to enforce the very healthy boundary you've now set in place.", "Your father reminds me of mine. Going very low contact with him for several years taught him that there are consequences to his behavior. He is better, though he still thinks he did nothing wrong and has never apologized. But he has learned that if he abuses me, he doesn't get to see me. And I won't play his \"happy family\" games either. I will tell anyone who asks exactly why I'm not talking to him. \n\nCan I give you some advice based on my experience? \n\n1. Take your mother out of the middle of your relationship with your father. She's trying to play mediator and I'm sure this is causing tremendous stress on her. She may be married to him and she may be your other parent, but your relationship with him is separate from your relationship with her. From now on, don't let her act as the communication line between you. The next time she starts talking to you about what your father said or how he feels, stop her immediately. Say, \"Mom, from now on I'm relieving you of the responsibility for my relationship with Dad. You should not be in the middle of this and I'm sorry you've had to be in the past. From now on, please don't pass on anything about Dad to me. If he wants to tell me something, he needs to tell me himself rather than playing telephone with you between us.\" And enforce it. Every time she starts to talk about your relationship with your dad, stop her and change the subject. This will be uncomfortable for both of you, but it's necessary. Your relationship with both your parents will improve. She will try harder for a while to \"fix\" things, but you need to stand strong. Give her 3 mentions of your dad in one conversation, then if she doesn't stop bringing it up, end the conversation politely and walk away or hang up. You need to set boundaries with both of them. \n2. Choosing neutral ground to meet with them is a good idea. You may need to go very low contact with your father. They want access to their grandchildren. That's understandable, but you need to protect your family from your father's abuse. It may sound terrible, but using access to you and your children as a reward for good behavior and as a punishment for bad behavior may be the only way that you can reach them. Think of it this way, you are protecting not only yourself but your children from abuse. Your children need to learn that you will protect them and that your father's behavior is not acceptable. Model loving relationships for them. It sounds like you are doing very well at this, based on how you have described your relationship with your husband.\n3. Please get therapy. You need someone who is neutral to discuss this with. And they will be able to help you with tools to develop a better relationship with your parents, if that is possible. \n4. This may be discouraging, but you have to be prepared for the possibility that you will never have a close relationship with your father. And, that you may need to go very low contact or even no contact with him. When you set boundaries, you need to be prepared to enforce them. I'm sure that you love him and can see some good in him. But you may find that for your own safety and sanity, you cannot be around him.\n5. I'm not sure of how your family works, but you may have some other relatives and family friends who will try to get involved. When they do, feel free to tell them exactly what has happened and why you have gone low contact with your father. There's a saying, \"If they wanted you to say nice things about them, they should have acted nicer.\" Being truthful about how your father has treated you will help you to overcome the abuse. There is a lot of shame involved with abuse. Being truthful will help you let go of this shame and the feeling that you were somehow responsible for his behavior. You were not. And you need support and validation of your feelings. Hopefully, people will recognize how badly your father has behaved, and will give you that.\n\nIf you need someone who has been there to talk to, please feel free to DM me. I will be thinking of your family. \ud83d\udc99", "NTA and you SHOULD keep your kids away from your abusive father!
