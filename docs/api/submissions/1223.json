They have 2 fridges with freezers and a large freezer. On multiple occassions my dad (the main offender) and possibly mom have come home with groceries and put massive ammounts of raw meat on my food, often this is without warning so I have no means to move the food out of the way and it is on top of things that will, and have gotten contaminated. I am not allowed access to a large amount of the food they buy and it is often my food that I bought that he is contaminating.\n\nMy dad says there is no where else to put it and that I have taken over the fridge. Out of the 2 fridges and 1 freezer I have 1 shelf in the garage fridge and 1 shelf in the large freezer that use mainly. These are not officially mine its just roughly what I take up, I will occasionally have food spread out a bit but I am 100% fine if they move it. The problem is he is not willing to move it. The other fridge is fully taken over by my family (to the point if you try and fit something in it it will fall out) and the garage fridge is almost always half empty. \n\n\nToday after having this happen again even though it would have been as simple as moving one container (a small box of cooked shrimp) or asking me for help they put roughly ten pounds of raw pork and beef on my stuff (I often help with bringing in groceries its just often not when they make a run to sams since they dont ask for help then so Im not aware of it)\n\nI have been certified in food safety before and have only very recently after 22 years stopped being immunocomprimised so he had been doing this while I was at a higher risk. We got into a screaming match and he called me entitled, I called him selfish. I dont think im in the wrong for wanting this to stop but I also feel bad for how it was handled on both ends.\n\nEdit: attempting to fix a few typos and adding a bit better context", "created_utc": 1667578041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym2xv9/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_stop_putting_raw_meat/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
