You take your niece to Taylor Swift. It's my understanding that the tickets are quite difficult to get. You and your niece should go and have a good time. Remember, it is YOU who bought the tickets with your own money. Your niece has only known her boyfriend for a short period of time, so stop doubting yourself. Enjoy the concert!", "NTA No one should have offered your ticket without asking you first and then kind of guilting you into giving it away. It doesn't really matter if he is willing to pay you for the ticket, it was not meant for him.", "NTA. Talk to your niece (directly; her going through her mother was a bit rude). You gave her a ticket, with a promise of this experience together. Tell her it's important to you that the two of you share this.\n\nYour niece is kind of an AH for asking (especially *not* asking, but having her mom do it). She wants to give this to her boyfriend of a few weeks. You're her aunt and that relationship matters. It's okay to tell her you're hurt by that.\n\nEnjoy the concert with your niece!", "NTA. You bought the tickets so you both can go. Just cause she got a boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it up. It\u2019s Taylor Swift, even if you aren\u2019t as big a fan as she is, it\u2019s still gonna be dope", "NTA, the gift you gave your niece was one ticket to a concert. You were explicit at the time that you also had a ticket and would go with your niece. You are under no obligation to relinquish your ticket to the show.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hate this for you.\n\nThis is the longest I've ever had to think about a reply.  I would not sell the ticket or give it to the boyfriend.  I think it's a bad lesson to teach.  \n\nWhen you accept an invitation or say yes = you mean yes.  That includes if you get a 'better invitation' (or a new boyfriend).  Your word is your bond.\n\nShe's likely going to have many more boyfriends.  You are the one who put the effort into getting the tickets.\n\nAlso, she didn't ask you herself.  Her Mom asked.", "NTA. She's sixteen. In a couple years she will barely remember this boyfriend's name and not give two figs for his opinion. But she will remember having a special experience with her aunt who went all out to do something amazing for her. It was very inappropriate for your SIL to even ask that you forfeit such a significant monetary and sentimental cost in favor of some high school boyfriend of a few weeks.", "NTA- why would she even think of that? You bought the tickets to take her with you. This isn't just about her being a fan, you are too. What else does the kid get, just because she wants it?", "NTA, and your niece needs a serious reality check. That\u2019s one of the rudest, most entitled reactions I\u2019ve ever read to a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA.  It's rude of them to ask, since part of why you came up with this present was as a way for the two of you to spend time together.  Especially since she's only been dating this fellow for a few weeks.\n\nTell her that you've been looking forward to spending the time with her and sharing the concert experience.  Suggest that you'd be glad to meet her boyfriend and offer to plan and pay for another event for the three of you.", "NTA, while your SIL asking you instead of her daughter doesn't feel nice but considering this is a 16 year old here the best is to talk to her directly and tell her that you really want to go to the concert with her, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and of course a bonding experience too.   \ncommunication is the key   \ni hope it goes well!", "NTA and it was beyond rude of her to volunteer your ticket to her boyfriend. This was a thoughtful gift. She can either go with you and be damned grateful, or you can take someone else. Her pick.", "NTA. It\u2019s ludicrous that she and her mother think it\u2019s okay to propose this change. They should never have even referenced this to the guy, and you should not give up your ticket. The audacity of people these days. We have lost our selfish, selfish minds.", "NTA. But your sister kind of sucks for even bringing this to you.  She should have told her daughter/your niece how rude this would be and shut it down immediately.  She just didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy, but she should parent better.", "NTA. Tell her you got the tickets for you too and that you look forward to going with her. In 10 years she won't even remember that boys name.", "NTA. Sixteen years old is not too young to learn that it's entitled and rude to receive a gift and turn around to ask for two gifts, which is what niece is doing re: the single ticket she was given.", "NTA", "NTA...the gift was yours to share with her.  If you don't really care about the concert you could always sell him the ticket (don't give it to him) and have a dinner date with her before.  If you want to go, just tell her that you have been looking forward to your \"date\" and don't want to give up your ticket.  She should never have asked him about a ticket that wasn't hers to offer.", "NTA - Talk to her directly. Tell her that you intended it to be a bonding experience and that you\u2019d really like to go with her! You should also add that though you are happy she is happy in her relationship, you were hurt by her asking her boyfriend about the concert because you thought it was clear the trip with for the two of you, especially since the concert was planned BEFORE her relationship. Don\u2019t guilt trip her, but you should be honest.", "Wnbta. Tell the SiL that you only bought the ticket for her birthday to JOIN you. As you were already going. Tell her she can either go with you or purchase their own tix and you can either sell them or go with someone else. Second option... sell them the ticket and never bother to do that type of thing again.", "OP yes you bought it for the memory of you and her to go, and she's only been going out with him for a few weeks.  However is she going to be less enthused going with you and potentially being snarky during your outing so neither of you are going to really enjoying yourselves?  This is the question you have to ask yourself.  If you're willing to deal with the potential tween negativity of a 16 y/o girl then more power to you and hopefully she'll be just as enthused as you will be.  It's just something to consider and something you may consider talking to her mom about since she was afraid to ask you herself.", "NTA and rude to ask personally I\u2019d ask the niece to pay for the ticket to fuck with her and be like \u201cjk lol\u201d", "That would be the last I treat her to anything. Some people have a lot of nerve.", "Nta, tell both of them you bought the tickets specifically so you could spend time with her and to share the experience with her. You went out of the way to get tickets for a concert that is extremely hard to get for you and her. Not for her and her boyfriend. She offered the ticket up before asking you about it. She sounds entitled and your sil is entitled too. Put your foot down about it. Tell her she has 2 options. Go with you like you originally planned or don\u2019t go at all and give up her ticket. If they try to gaslight you or make you feel guilty for something YOU bought, I\u2019d take away the tickets and go with a friend who\u2019ll actually want to spend time with you and just give her cash as a replacement since she thinks she can so easily replace you. If she wants to sulk, she can sulk at home the day of the concert with her boyfriend.", "YWNBTA You bought her one ticket and you bought yourself the other ticket. It's incredibly rude of all of them to assume you don't want to go and have already floated the idea to the boyfriend.   \n\n\nListen, I've been to the Eras Tour twice. It's amazing. Don't be guilted into giving up your ticket. Your niece is incredibly lucky to even be going. Resale of those tickets are in the $1000s. I can't get over any of them thinking it's okay to casually offer your ticket to someone else. You didn't buy your niece two tickets. You bought her one.", "YWNBTA but this is one of those times where I feel like it's worth remembering that not being an asshole is a pretty low bar. If it's *a gift for her* and she wants to go with her boyfriend, and the boy in question is someone her mom trusts enough for that, then it's probably better to just let the boyfriend comp you for the ticket and the two of them go together.", "NTA .. BUT!!!\n\nIf you're not a \"huge fan\" then it would be nice of you to let her bf pay you for the ticket (even nicer to just let her have 2 tickets as her present) and let them go together. \n\nIn general when I have given tickets to people as a gift, I give them 2 tickets and let them choose who they want to go with them. If they choose me, then that's awesome, but I always let them know that they don't have to go with me. The 2 tickets are theirs to do with as they will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a TS concert, super. But your niece is 16. I understand she will prefer spending the evening her way in order to fully enjoy it.

They were meant for bonding time between you.  \n\nPoint out that in polite society etiquette dictates that one doesn't change their mind and go to another party considered more desirable, when already expected at a party.
