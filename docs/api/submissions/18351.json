You take your niece to Taylor Swift. It's my understanding that the tickets are quite difficult to get. You and your niece should go and have a good time. Remember, it is YOU who bought the tickets with your own money. Your niece has only known her boyfriend for a short period of time, so stop doubting yourself. Enjoy the concert!", "NTA No one should have offered your ticket without asking you first and then kind of guilting you into giving it away. It doesn't really matter if he is willing to pay you for the ticket, it was not meant for him.", "NTA. Talk to your niece (directly; her going through her mother was a bit rude). You gave her a ticket, with a promise of this experience together. Tell her it's important to you that the two of you share this.\n\nYour niece is kind of an AH for asking (especially *not* asking, but having her mom do it). She wants to give this to her boyfriend of a few weeks. You're her aunt and that relationship matters. It's okay to tell her you're hurt by that.\n\nEnjoy the concert with your niece!", "NTA. You bought the tickets so you both can go. Just cause she got a boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it up. It\u2019s Taylor Swift, even if you aren\u2019t as big a fan as she is, it\u2019s still gonna be dope", "NTA, the gift you gave your niece was one ticket to a concert. You were explicit at the time that you also had a ticket and would go with your niece. You are under no obligation to relinquish your ticket to the show.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hate this for you.\n\nThis is the longest I've ever had to think about a reply.  I would not sell the ticket or give it to the boyfriend.  I think it's a bad lesson to teach.  \n\nWhen you accept an invitation or say yes = you mean yes.  That includes if you get a 'better invitation' (or a new boyfriend).  Your word is your bond.\n\nShe's likely going to have many more boyfriends.  You are the one who put the effort into getting the tickets.\n\nAlso, she didn't ask you herself.  Her Mom asked.", "NTA. She's sixteen. In a couple years she will barely remember this boyfriend's name and not give two figs for his opinion. But she will remember having a special experience with her aunt who went all out to do something amazing for her. It was very inappropriate for your SIL to even ask that you forfeit such a significant monetary and sentimental cost in favor of some high school boyfriend of a few weeks.", "NTA- why would she even think of that? You bought the tickets to take her with you. This isn't just about her being a fan, you are too. What else does the kid get, just because she wants it?", "NTA, and your niece needs a serious reality check. That\u2019s one of the rudest, most entitled reactions I\u2019ve ever read to a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA.  It's rude of them to ask, since part of why you came up with this present was as a way for the two of you to spend time together.  Especially since she's only been dating this fellow for a few weeks.\n\nTell her that you've been looking forward to spending the time with her and sharing the concert experience.  Suggest that you'd be glad to meet her boyfriend and offer to plan and pay for another event for the three of you.", "NTA, while your SIL asking you instead of her daughter doesn't feel nice but considering this is a 16 year old here the best is to talk to her directly and tell her that you really want to go to the concert with her, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and of course a bonding experience too.   \ncommunication is the key   \ni hope it goes well!", "NTA and it was beyond rude of her to volunteer your ticket to her boyfriend. This was a thoughtful gift. She can either go with you and be damned grateful, or you can take someone else. Her pick.", "NTA. It\u2019s ludicrous that she and her mother think it\u2019s okay to propose this change. They should never have even referenced this to the guy, and you should not give up your ticket. The audacity of people these days. We have lost our selfish, selfish minds.", "NTA. But your sister kind of sucks for even bringing this to you.  She should have told her daughter/your niece how rude this would be and shut it down immediately.  She just didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy, but she should parent better.", "NTA. Tell her you got the tickets for you too and that you look forward to going with her. In 10 years she won't even remember that boys name.", "NTA. Sixteen years old is not too young to learn that it's entitled and rude to receive a gift and turn around to ask for two gifts, which is what niece is doing re: the single ticket she was given.", "NTA", "NTA...the gift was yours to share with her.  If you don't really care about the concert you could always sell him the ticket (don't give it to him) and have a dinner date with her before.  If you want to go, just tell her that you have been looking forward to your \"date\" and don't want to give up your ticket.  She should never have asked him about a ticket that wasn't hers to offer.", "NTA - Talk to her directly. Tell her that you intended it to be a bonding experience and that you\u2019d really like to go with her! You should also add that though you are happy she is happy in her relationship, you were hurt by her asking her boyfriend about the concert because you thought it was clear the trip with for the two of you, especially since the concert was planned BEFORE her relationship. Don\u2019t guilt trip her, but you should be honest.", "Wnbta. Tell the SiL that you only bought the ticket for her birthday to JOIN you. As you were already going. Tell her she can either go with you or purchase their own tix and you can either sell them or go with someone else. Second option... sell them the ticket and never bother to do that type of thing again.", "OP yes you bought it for the memory of you and her to go, and she's only been going out with him for a few weeks.  However is she going to be less enthused going with you and potentially being snarky during your outing so neither of you are going to really enjoying yourselves?  This is the question you have to ask yourself.  If you're willing to deal with the potential tween negativity of a 16 y/o girl then more power to you and hopefully she'll be just as enthused as you will be.  It's just something to consider and something you may consider talking to her mom about since she was afraid to ask you herself.", "NTA and rude to ask personally I\u2019d ask the niece to pay for the ticket to fuck with her and be like \u201cjk lol\u201d", "That would be the last I treat her to anything. Some people have a lot of nerve.", "Nta, tell both of them you bought the tickets specifically so you could spend time with her and to share the experience with her. You went out of the way to get tickets for a concert that is extremely hard to get for you and her. Not for her and her boyfriend. She offered the ticket up before asking you about it. She sounds entitled and your sil is entitled too. Put your foot down about it. Tell her she has 2 options. Go with you like you originally planned or don\u2019t go at all and give up her ticket. If they try to gaslight you or make you feel guilty for something YOU bought, I\u2019d take away the tickets and go with a friend who\u2019ll actually want to spend time with you and just give her cash as a replacement since she thinks she can so easily replace you. If she wants to sulk, she can sulk at home the day of the concert with her boyfriend.", "YWNBTA You bought her one ticket and you bought yourself the other ticket. It's incredibly rude of all of them to assume you don't want to go and have already floated the idea to the boyfriend.   \n\n\nListen, I've been to the Eras Tour twice. It's amazing. Don't be guilted into giving up your ticket. Your niece is incredibly lucky to even be going. Resale of those tickets are in the $1000s. I can't get over any of them thinking it's okay to casually offer your ticket to someone else. You didn't buy your niece two tickets. You bought her one.", "YWNBTA but this is one of those times where I feel like it's worth remembering that not being an asshole is a pretty low bar. If it's *a gift for her* and she wants to go with her boyfriend, and the boy in question is someone her mom trusts enough for that, then it's probably better to just let the boyfriend comp you for the ticket and the two of them go together.", "NTA .. BUT!!!\n\nIf you're not a \"huge fan\" then it would be nice of you to let her bf pay you for the ticket (even nicer to just let her have 2 tickets as her present) and let them go together. \n\nIn general when I have given tickets to people as a gift, I give them 2 tickets and let them choose who they want to go with them. If they choose me, then that's awesome, but I always let them know that they don't have to go with me. The 2 tickets are theirs to do with as they will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a TS concert, super. But your niece is 16. I understand she will prefer spending the evening her way in order to fully enjoy it.

They were meant for bonding time between you.  \n\nPoint out that in polite society etiquette dictates that one doesn't change their mind and go to another party considered more desirable, when already expected at a party.

It's not something you can say to her now, but if that happens, she'll just have a memory of the going to Taylor Swift with her ex. You, on the other hand, will never be a ex auntie.", "NTA but also, since it was her mother that brought it up I kinda assumed SHE wanted to go. Maybe that boyfriend isn't in the picture by the time the concert happens and she needs someone to go? Anyway, you're allowed to have experiences planned, enjoy the show!", "F-that. Go to the concert. Your niece is a bit of a cow, her mum, too. YWNBTA. That was a very generous gift. You are a good aunt.", "YWNBTA. Your niece is ungrateful and rude and your SIL seems to be endorsing the behaviour.

It's for your niece's bday, yes, but you bought the tickets and you like Taylor's music. You have been excited and looking forward to the event with the intention of spending quality time with your niece. You don't have to be a hardcore fan like your niece to justify you going. Again, you bought the tickets. You bought them for you and her, not her and a guest of her choosing. It was honestly rude of her to even suggest to her new boyfriend that he could take your place and to get her mom to ask you. She didn't even ask you herself -- I think because deep down she knows it's not right because she knows you'll be hurt and/or disappointed. Sixteen year olds can be thoughtless (as shown by the suggestion of the ticket swap), but they aren't stupid.\n\nIf your niece's new boyfriend wants to go to the concert, he can buy an exorbitantly priced ticket from a reseller because that's what I'd expect for him to pay you, if you were willing to give up your spot. If he can't afford it and/or is only willing to pay original ticket price, then that is extremely laughable. If sil has anything negative to say, than she can help him buy one. I honestly can't believe sil had the gall to even text you to ask. Those tickets were not easy to get. You would only be the AH if you said yes because you'd be doing a disservice to yourself. If your niece gets upset, she'll get over by the time the concert rolls around. Again she's sixteen and it's a brand new relationship. She'll definitely get over it.\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar.", "YWNBTA. I totally understand that you want to enjoy the experience with your niece and you were looking forward to it.\n\nThat said, the niece is a teenager and is probably swept up in the excitement of having a new boyfriend.

It\u2019s about the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s your call. Giving her boyfriend the ticket and letting them experience it will likely make her happier in the short term. Of course in the long term she will remember good memories with her family and loved ones much more. But having been a teenager myself, I know that if my aunt insisted on going with me when I wanted to go with my bae would lead me into an angry sulk. Similarly, my sister is much younger than me and if I bought tix for us to experience something together and she wanted to with her boyfriend instead, I know she would get annoyed if I insisted on going with her. I\u2019m thinking that maybe you can try having the conversation with her that you\u2019d love to go with her and experience this with her, see how she takes it, and if she gets upset, then for the sake of giving her a happy experience on her birthday, it might be okay to give it up.

You will always be her aunt, you can spend time with her anytime.\n\nHer BF on the other hand, there is no guarantee their relation will last forever and this concert can be a good (or bittersweet) memories for them.", "I\u2019m just shocked at how ungrateful your niece is with this all being her idea.

You will attend the concert with one if your friends instead.", "YWNBTA - no way. \n\nMaybe I'm old-fashioned but that is a rude ask! That was a present/experience for you and her to share and then she goes and asks her bf to go instead of you?? RUDE!!", "Wow. People are being really harsh on your niece. NAH except maybe your niece's mom for stepping in rather than talking to your niece about what it might mean to you, and getting your niece to talk to you herself. \n\nYou're not going to be the asshole for keeping the ticket and the original plan but please remember what it's like to be 16. Your friends and dates mean The World and you mostly wish any adults in your family even the coolest of adults in your family, would leave you alone and let you live your teenage life. You already said she doesn\u2019t have friends who would be excited for this concert, so the fact that she has a boyfriend who would go is particularly significant. Did you tell your niece that you would go with us since she didn\u2019t have any friends to take her? Because if that\u2019s the case, it also makes sense that she would think now that she has a boyfriend who likes Taylor Swift, he could go instead.\n\nWhich is why it would also be OK to let the boyfriend go with her. Like that would be a nice gesture towards recognizing her relationship and her independence, but it would also be totally legit for you to want to go and experience this with her.

I get that you want to go, but just imagine how much happier she'll be if her bf can go with her? I get that you wanted to be the cool aunt taking her niece to the show, but she's at an age (assuming) where she would rather be with her bf. Put yourself in her shoes, what would you want?

Why pass up that opportunity? \n\nSo while you may not really be TA one way or another it's sort of just neutral to me. But if you'd sell the ticket to the bf you'd definitely be the coolest aunt imo. She's a teenager, I'm sure she'll be close with you once she's an adult and you aren't even a massive fan of Taylor anyways. If you were as much a fan of Taylor as she was or anywhere near, I'd probably think differently a bit even despite it being a gift.

I feel for you, you wanted to enjoy it together.  I'm glad boyfriend is offering to buy, instead of expecting. Its insensitive for niece to ask this but its age appropriate self absorption.  Up to you... you could tell her how you feel and see if you can come to a solution, maybe", "NTA. You\u2019re a person and get to go to concerts too! I was brought up to never fiddle with gifts. Always express gratitude. Always right thank you notes. Gifts aren\u2019t automatic. If a 16 year old knows no better, it is partly because of her parents. And OMG the we-sies. Two by two in lockstep!Life is not all about transcendent coupledom, no matter how cute the pictures of the two teens would be. If the girl doesn\u2019t want to go, sell the ticket or take someone else. The new bf and mama would never pay for the ticket at the new price.", "NTA it's your ticket bf can buy an extra ticket and go but assuming he can just buy yours is entitled", "Don't you dare! Keep it and go with her! Family is so important!! Go w her and make some great memories", "Geez, your sister-in-law missed a really good parenting opportunity here.  She could have explained to her daughter how much expense and trouble you went to to get those tickets, how thoughtful of a gesture it was from you and that, yes, it might be more fun to take her bf, but it would be hurtful and rude to suggest it.  Empathy and kindness have to be modeled and exercised to become habit.  Go to the concert with your neice.  You two will always have a relationship.  I can't even think of the name of the guy I liked when I was 16.", "I'm angry on your behalf that your family is putting you in this position and even suggested it in the first place.", "YENBTA.\n\nI think it's safer for your neice if you go with her. Concerts can be fun. But large stadiums are overwhelming and sixteen year Olds can be quite vulnerable going to a city show by themselves.\n\nExplain to your neice you were looking forward to some quality time together. You would feel more comfortable going with her yourself. Her boyfriend should understand and be okay with not going.", "NTA You gave her one ticket and travel and companionship. Not two tickets. If she complains tell her you understand she no longer wants your present and will get her something else.", "NTA\nYour SIL should\u2019ve shut this down and shouldn\u2019t even have asked you. \nHopefully your niece will still enjoy the concert and not be sulky.", "She'll only resent you if you say no", "NTA. But I would talk to your niece, and find out exactly how disappointed she is. \n\nAbsolutely do not give the ticket to her.. but you deserve to have a good time at the concert, and you should bring someone who is going to have a good time\u2026 with YOU. \n\nIf she is going to be rude to you, and have a bad time to punish you, then tell her the concert is off, and bring a friend.", "NTA. Those tickets are going for $2500 each in some cities. You didn't give her 2 tickets. You gave her one. This is a great time to sit her down and talk to her about the importance of not dropping the important people in her life for a guy. He didn't earn those tickets and you don't deserve to be uninvited to something you invited HER to.", "If she doesn't want to go with you, sell your ticket online and then tell her good luck attending the concert by herself.", "I think it\u2019s important OP reminds them that the ticket was a gift of going to the concert with her aunt. If she doesn\u2019t want that gift, she can definitely give it back and aunt can take someone else and they can figure out a gift card or something instead. \n\nNiece wasn\u2019t gifted two tickets, she was gifted one to accompany OP who bought them, the second ticket wasn\u2019t hers to give away or offer.", "You bought her 1 ticket. You got your ticket. You are also providing transportation.  NTA op.\n\nEdit to add: Boyfriend of a few WEEKS. No. No. No.", "These tickets are so hard to get and a 16 year old who's a massive fan is aware of that. She's young so it can be forgiven but I can't imagine even asking someone to give up that ticket, ESPECIALLY something that was a gift that comes with spending time together! YWNBTA.", "The way i would break up with the niece and resell my ticket and block her number.", "NTA this 100 percent", "This is some new partner of a month.  Don't waste this experience on him. He'll be gone as fast as he showed up, but you're her family forever and you guys will have this really great memory together forever.", "Right! That would've hurt me and I would give her and never do anything like that again", "And clearly state that if the niece would rather spend time with the new bf, aunt can find someone else to go with her to the concert and the two lovebirds can stay home", "This is a great take, excellent point. To accept an invitation and then to ask the person who has invited you to give up their spot is not good manners. The mom should have really provided this message to the neice and should never even have come up as a question.", "Spot on. You know\u2026 I wonder who suggested it in the first place. \n\n\u201cGive up the ticket you spent hundreds of dollars on (and probably a long time waiting for) so my daughter can go with a boy she\u2019s been texting for a couple weeks!\u201d \n\nI think it\u2019s also probably telling about how OP\u2019s SIL sees OP. Need additional context for that though", "Agreed. This would have been a good teaching moment for the niece. The mom should have explained to her daughter why this would be a rude request. If OP had offered to take the mom to the show as a gift for them to go together, and the mom had said \u201cthanks, can I take both tickets and go with my husband instead?\u201d It would be incredibly rude and entitled. At 16, the niece is old enough to learn this.", "Right!! I really can\u2019t believe your SIL for the suggestion, it\u2019s a no clearly. The present is the experience, with you !", "Exactly. SIL should never have put OP in this position", "Idk, as someone at 25 currently with the first girl I dated in high school at 15, there's a non zero chance it could last and be a special memory akin to how I feel about the couple concerts I went to with her in HS. That being said, it's OPs right to use their ticket how they see fit and if he's a decent bf, he won't make a big deal about it and neither should the niece.", "I\u2019m so worried the bf only wants to go so he can talk the niece into scalping them for a ton of money once they get there. OP, please do not give/sell the ticket to him. NTA.", "I *am* old and have a 16-year-old niece who would never do this to me. Thankfully she still thinks I\u2019m cool for some reason \ud83d\ude42", "He isn't going to comp her. Where would he get the cashola? They have only been dating a couple weeks. He can sit this out.", "i doubt he\u2019d really pay for it as taylor swift tickets sell for thousands", "He said he would pay her for the ticket.", "The only fandom that is willing to start a beef with them are tool fans, but we're already nuts.", "I don't think swift need guerilla marketing. You don't get crap seats to be worth $2k through guerilla marketing.", "The fandom is scary. I once posted that I \"didn't get it\" about TS and I legit got banned from a chat group because of it.", "It's that fandom. I have a friend of a friend that drove to a Texas show from Denver, had no tickets and no hotel, bought tickets there, enjoyed the show, slept in their car, and then drove back the next day. They also go to all the underground Swift Dance Parties that happen in Denver.", "Niece\u2019s mother, not the aunt. OP is the aunt", "Her mum really should have pointed out to her too, that even asking is really not ok, as it potentially ruins the whole thing for her automatically. It leaves OP in the situation of feeling like her niece doesn't want to go with her. \n\nSo she can say yes, and feel crap because she doesn't get to see Taylor, and she feels unwanted. Or say no and feel like she's forcing her niece to go with her. Yuck.", "Conspiracy theory, the mom thought that after the Aunt handed over the tickets, there was a chance she could engineer a breakup and she would be forced to step in at short notice to take her daughter to the concert", "If I was the mom I would have told the daughter that her request is incredibly inappropriate. I genuinely don't think the niece should even be going any more.", "Those tickets were so. Hard. To. Get. \n\nI still have trauma from that presale lol. \n\nI doubt the SIL has any idea the magnitude of what\u2019s being asked. Maybe have your husband forward her the Ticketmaster debacle articles?", "This is really a great example.  I hope the OP reads this and can have This Explanation passed back to the niece.  \n\n(IF niece is not happy going with Aunt-OP, then aunt should take someone else, or else sell that extra ticket and go alone.)", "Or if OP said \"can I take both tickets and go with my new boyfriend of 2 weeks?\"", "This was my first thought too. The girl goes with the aunt, but is pissed off he whole time.  Nobody has fun and the aunt is annoyed with the teen.  It's a problem now.  I think mom didn't want to tell her daughter no, so left it to OP to say no, so daughter will be mad at OP and not at her mom.  I don't think OP should give the guy the ticket, but just be aware of the outcome.", "Oh, don't be silly. They're probably still expecting a ride from her.", "This a weenie hut JR kinda take tbh, not every new driver sucks, I had no problem with concert traffic at 16/17 and I know a lot of people in the same boat lol", "i don\u2019t think the niece sounds like an ungrateful brat, we really don\u2019t know what was said (YWNBTA OP)", "This is the response right here.", "I agree with no gifts going forward, or at least not to this magnitude. Teens get a bad wrap but if she's a fan, she knows at 16 what these tickets are worth and how hard it was to get them. It's entitled and ungrateful. I have been in a smaller scale situation, where a gave my eldest nibling an \"experience\" gift for a holiday, and explained that was the case,  and then they acted out when their much younger siblings received an actual gift for the holiday and they got \"nothing\".", "Of course he does. I\u2019m sure the resale value hasn\u2019t even crossed their minds.", "no like look at this way.  \nwhy would you want to go with someone who doesn't want to go with you?\n\nit's a matter of self-respect tbh", "The highest I've seen was $5k, for lower bowl.", "I work with high profile clients - booking their trips, scheduling reservations, etc. one of those things is finding Taylor swift tickets. For good seats, they\u2019re $10k plus. Like front section type of deal. I have not successfully sold a Taylor swift ticket because they are outlandish. Not even to rich people.", "I have nosebleed seats, I checked the resell value of them, can confirm nothing less than 2k in the 500 section.", "I tried getting tickets after the initial sale and I couldn\u2019t find any for less than 1500. Bummer bc I couldn\u2019t sit in a ticket master queue for hours", "I have floor seats for $350, I won\u2019t even look up how much they\u2019re worth bc I really want to go and not be tempted to take the money and run lol", "It's also illegal.", "Most 16 year olds with any type of social media know and understand how much something cool costs. They May be unaware how much effort goes into earning that money if it isn't something they earned themselves. But if they live in America they definitely understand spending money on things highly sought after.", "Oh, he would know, but I would also not give it to him. To me the experience *together* is part of the present and to ask the aunt to give that up is rude. So Op you WNBTA to go with your niece and not give up the ticket for the new boyfriend.", "And they just started dating, who is to say they will even be together when the concert happens?", "The niece is a Swiftie. If she knows, he should. I don't know how that conversation happens without mentioning the current resale value of tickets. From someone who had a Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket that I had to resell, everyone was gobsmacked that I was willing to part with it for less than $500 to people I have known for years.", "He might know, and want to get his hands on the ticket to push her to sell them!", "I don't follow things like that, don't have friends that follow it or are fans and I know how crazy the whole Taylor Swift concert ticket thing has been,  he's 16 with a girlfriend who loves Taylor Swift - it would be pretty near impossible for him to not know.", "You can bet that he wants to pay her the price on the tickets and not several thousands dollars.", "There were 20,000 people outside our Philly show. That's just a whole 'nother concert.", "They didn\u2019t even make it to general sale lol. Oversold the presale.", "At least with getting tickets a lot of the blame goes to TicketMaster", "Dude it is getting worse. I have kids in my class who bring backpacks full of toys, because their parents refuse to tell them no.", "The mom can be the AH, and the teenage niece should know better. Both things are true.", "OK I'm so sick of this mindset of \"teenagers don't know any better\" yes they do. I know that for a fact I used to be a teenager.", "16 year olds knows better than this. Probably wasn\u2019t thinking but they definitely know not to do this", "They just have much less experience at dealing with driving situations.  I worried more about what other idiots did that how my kids drove, and people seem to do even dumber things while driving now that when my drivers were young.", "Dang. That\u2019s so crazy to me. I don\u2019t have 5k to just waste like that, would be nice tho.", "It depends on where you live. There\u2019s no federal laws preventing this, I think there\u2019s only like maybe 15 states where it\u2019s actually illegal, 5 or so of those states require you to have a license to resell tickets. \n\nSo people doing it, could be doing it in a state where there\u2019s no laws preventing it", "There's no reason to suspect that bf is planning to sell the ticket or that he'd even have access to it before the night of the concert.\n\nTwo teens want to go to a concert together so they asked for the ticket. Nothing wrong with asking since it was meant to be a bday gift for the teen and op isn't a fan.\n\nIf op does want to go that's fine as well since those were the original terms.\n\nNah. I don't know why you're assigning malicious intent to a random teen boy who just wants to go to a fun concert with his gf...", "He was a security guard at the concert venue. He found a way to see the concert he wanted to see, and get paid to see it.", "I've seen so many people sign up for volunteer shifts at the venues lol", "this statement is inaccurate lol", "My almost 30 yr old daughter has been a fan since the beginning.", "No, EVERYONE doesn\u2019t love her music\u2026", ">younger girls don't exactly have TS money like the 20-30 year olds\n\nGood thing they have their 40-50yo parents' money.", "Bro the same, as I was sneaking out of the house to go drink in fields. I knew exactly what I was doing, and what needed to be done to get away with it.", "Millenials/Gen Y were born between 1981-1995, so 28 to 42\n\nYou're thinking of Gen Z.", "Pretty sure it's from mid 20's to late 30's.", "Mine did lol, turning 30 still with her 14 years later haha. But in reality you are correct haha", "I\u2019ll be aging myself here but the only way I\u2019d pay that for a concert ticket is if The Beatles reunited. And that means John Lennon & George Harrison coming back to life. Not Sean Lennon & Dhani Harrison standing in for their fathers.", "Is Taylor swift giving away golden showers on those concerts?", "Pretty smart I'd say.  If he's well suited for the job and ot provides him what what he needs to get by (wage and medical benefits eise) and there are cool perks like seeing shows...pretty much a win all around.", "Thank you for clarifying this lol working at the venue is far less creepy than becoming her personal guard just to see the show. One sounds resourceful and clever and one sounds like the start to a scary lifetime movie \ud83e\udd23", "That's not even true though. She's been a prominent musician for a decade now. Many of her fans have grown up with her.", "Well you have all her albums", "What a weird fucking comment to make.", "I know of many full grown men who are swifties. Def not just for young girls.", "Some of us don't. I don't think I know anyone who is a fan- but I'm old.\n\nHer fans are growing old with her so it fits that the majority of them are older teens/young adults.\n\nOP still shouldn't part with her ticket. She's given her niece an experience with her, not some random boyfriend who might not be in the picture a week after the concert."]}
