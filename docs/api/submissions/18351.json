You take your niece to Taylor Swift. It's my understanding that the tickets are quite difficult to get. You and your niece should go and have a good time. Remember, it is YOU who bought the tickets with your own money. Your niece has only known her boyfriend for a short period of time, so stop doubting yourself. Enjoy the concert!", "NTA No one should have offered your ticket without asking you first and then kind of guilting you into giving it away. It doesn't really matter if he is willing to pay you for the ticket, it was not meant for him.", "NTA. Talk to your niece (directly; her going through her mother was a bit rude). You gave her a ticket, with a promise of this experience together. Tell her it's important to you that the two of you share this.\n\nYour niece is kind of an AH for asking (especially *not* asking, but having her mom do it). She wants to give this to her boyfriend of a few weeks. You're her aunt and that relationship matters. It's okay to tell her you're hurt by that.\n\nEnjoy the concert with your niece!", "NTA. You bought the tickets so you both can go. Just cause she got a boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it up. It\u2019s Taylor Swift, even if you aren\u2019t as big a fan as she is, it\u2019s still gonna be dope", "NTA, the gift you gave your niece was one ticket to a concert. You were explicit at the time that you also had a ticket and would go with your niece. You are under no obligation to relinquish your ticket to the show.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hate this for you.\n\nThis is the longest I've ever had to think about a reply.  I would not sell the ticket or give it to the boyfriend.  I think it's a bad lesson to teach.  \n\nWhen you accept an invitation or say yes = you mean yes.  That includes if you get a 'better invitation' (or a new boyfriend).  Your word is your bond.\n\nShe's likely going to have many more boyfriends.  You are the one who put the effort into getting the tickets.\n\nAlso, she didn't ask you herself.  Her Mom asked.", "NTA. She's sixteen. In a couple years she will barely remember this boyfriend's name and not give two figs for his opinion. But she will remember having a special experience with her aunt who went all out to do something amazing for her. It was very inappropriate for your SIL to even ask that you forfeit such a significant monetary and sentimental cost in favor of some high school boyfriend of a few weeks.", "NTA- why would she even think of that? You bought the tickets to take her with you. This isn't just about her being a fan, you are too. What else does the kid get, just because she wants it?", "NTA, and your niece needs a serious reality check. That\u2019s one of the rudest, most entitled reactions I\u2019ve ever read to a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA.  It's rude of them to ask, since part of why you came up with this present was as a way for the two of you to spend time together.  Especially since she's only been dating this fellow for a few weeks.\n\nTell her that you've been looking forward to spending the time with her and sharing the concert experience.  Suggest that you'd be glad to meet her boyfriend and offer to plan and pay for another event for the three of you.", "NTA, while your SIL asking you instead of her daughter doesn't feel nice but considering this is a 16 year old here the best is to talk to her directly and tell her that you really want to go to the concert with her, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and of course a bonding experience too.   \ncommunication is the key   \ni hope it goes well!", "NTA and it was beyond rude of her to volunteer your ticket to her boyfriend. This was a thoughtful gift. She can either go with you and be damned grateful, or you can take someone else. Her pick.", "NTA. It\u2019s ludicrous that she and her mother think it\u2019s okay to propose this change. They should never have even referenced this to the guy, and you should not give up your ticket. The audacity of people these days. We have lost our selfish, selfish minds.", "NTA. But your sister kind of sucks for even bringing this to you.  She should have told her daughter/your niece how rude this would be and shut it down immediately.  She just didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy, but she should parent better.", "NTA. Tell her you got the tickets for you too and that you look forward to going with her. In 10 years she won't even remember that boys name.", "NTA. Sixteen years old is not too young to learn that it's entitled and rude to receive a gift and turn around to ask for two gifts, which is what niece is doing re: the single ticket she was given.", "NTA", "NTA...the gift was yours to share with her.  If you don't really care about the concert you could always sell him the ticket (don't give it to him) and have a dinner date with her before.  If you want to go, just tell her that you have been looking forward to your \"date\" and don't want to give up your ticket.  She should never have asked him about a ticket that wasn't hers to offer.", "NTA - Talk to her directly. Tell her that you intended it to be a bonding experience and that you\u2019d really like to go with her! You should also add that though you are happy she is happy in her relationship, you were hurt by her asking her boyfriend about the concert because you thought it was clear the trip with for the two of you, especially since the concert was planned BEFORE her relationship. Don\u2019t guilt trip her, but you should be honest.", "Wnbta. Tell the SiL that you only bought the ticket for her birthday to JOIN you. As you were already going. Tell her she can either go with you or purchase their own tix and you can either sell them or go with someone else. Second option... sell them the ticket and never bother to do that type of thing again.", "OP yes you bought it for the memory of you and her to go, and she's only been going out with him for a few weeks.  However is she going to be less enthused going with you and potentially being snarky during your outing so neither of you are going to really enjoying yourselves?  This is the question you have to ask yourself.  If you're willing to deal with the potential tween negativity of a 16 y/o girl then more power to you and hopefully she'll be just as enthused as you will be.  It's just something to consider and something you may consider talking to her mom about since she was afraid to ask you herself.", "NTA and rude to ask personally I\u2019d ask the niece to pay for the ticket to fuck with her and be like \u201cjk lol\u201d", "That would be the last I treat her to anything. Some people have a lot of nerve.", "Nta, tell both of them you bought the tickets specifically so you could spend time with her and to share the experience with her. You went out of the way to get tickets for a concert that is extremely hard to get for you and her. Not for her and her boyfriend. She offered the ticket up before asking you about it. She sounds entitled and your sil is entitled too. Put your foot down about it. Tell her she has 2 options. Go with you like you originally planned or don\u2019t go at all and give up her ticket. If they try to gaslight you or make you feel guilty for something YOU bought, I\u2019d take away the tickets and go with a friend who\u2019ll actually want to spend time with you and just give her cash as a replacement since she thinks she can so easily replace you. If she wants to sulk, she can sulk at home the day of the concert with her boyfriend.", "YWNBTA You bought her one ticket and you bought yourself the other ticket. It's incredibly rude of all of them to assume you don't want to go and have already floated the idea to the boyfriend.   \n\n\nListen, I've been to the Eras Tour twice. It's amazing. Don't be guilted into giving up your ticket. Your niece is incredibly lucky to even be going. Resale of those tickets are in the $1000s. I can't get over any of them thinking it's okay to casually offer your ticket to someone else. You didn't buy your niece two tickets. You bought her one.", "YWNBTA but this is one of those times where I feel like it's worth remembering that not being an asshole is a pretty low bar. If it's *a gift for her* and she wants to go with her boyfriend, and the boy in question is someone her mom trusts enough for that, then it's probably better to just let the boyfriend comp you for the ticket and the two of them go together.", "NTA .. BUT!!!\n\nIf you're not a \"huge fan\" then it would be nice of you to let her bf pay you for the ticket (even nicer to just let her have 2 tickets as her present) and let them go together. \n\nIn general when I have given tickets to people as a gift, I give them 2 tickets and let them choose who they want to go with them. If they choose me, then that's awesome, but I always let them know that they don't have to go with me. The 2 tickets are theirs to do with as they will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a TS concert, super. But your niece is 16. I understand she will prefer spending the evening her way in order to fully enjoy it.

They were meant for bonding time between you.  \n\nPoint out that in polite society etiquette dictates that one doesn't change their mind and go to another party considered more desirable, when already expected at a party.

It's not something you can say to her now, but if that happens, she'll just have a memory of the going to Taylor Swift with her ex. You, on the other hand, will never be a ex auntie.", "NTA but also, since it was her mother that brought it up I kinda assumed SHE wanted to go. Maybe that boyfriend isn't in the picture by the time the concert happens and she needs someone to go? Anyway, you're allowed to have experiences planned, enjoy the show!", "F-that. Go to the concert. Your niece is a bit of a cow, her mum, too. YWNBTA. That was a very generous gift. You are a good aunt.", "YWNBTA. Your niece is ungrateful and rude and your SIL seems to be endorsing the behaviour.

It's for your niece's bday, yes, but you bought the tickets and you like Taylor's music. You have been excited and looking forward to the event with the intention of spending quality time with your niece. You don't have to be a hardcore fan like your niece to justify you going. Again, you bought the tickets. You bought them for you and her, not her and a guest of her choosing. It was honestly rude of her to even suggest to her new boyfriend that he could take your place and to get her mom to ask you. She didn't even ask you herself -- I think because deep down she knows it's not right because she knows you'll be hurt and/or disappointed. Sixteen year olds can be thoughtless (as shown by the suggestion of the ticket swap), but they aren't stupid.\n\nIf your niece's new boyfriend wants to go to the concert, he can buy an exorbitantly priced ticket from a reseller because that's what I'd expect for him to pay you, if you were willing to give up your spot. If he can't afford it and/or is only willing to pay original ticket price, then that is extremely laughable. If sil has anything negative to say, than she can help him buy one. I honestly can't believe sil had the gall to even text you to ask. Those tickets were not easy to get. You would only be the AH if you said yes because you'd be doing a disservice to yourself. If your niece gets upset, she'll get over by the time the concert rolls around. Again she's sixteen and it's a brand new relationship. She'll definitely get over it.\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar.", "YWNBTA. I totally understand that you want to enjoy the experience with your niece and you were looking forward to it.\n\nThat said, the niece is a teenager and is probably swept up in the excitement of having a new boyfriend.

It\u2019s about the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s your call. Giving her boyfriend the ticket and letting them experience it will likely make her happier in the short term. Of course in the long term she will remember good memories with her family and loved ones much more. But having been a teenager myself, I know that if my aunt insisted on going with me when I wanted to go with my bae would lead me into an angry sulk. Similarly, my sister is much younger than me and if I bought tix for us to experience something together and she wanted to with her boyfriend instead, I know she would get annoyed if I insisted on going with her. I\u2019m thinking that maybe you can try having the conversation with her that you\u2019d love to go with her and experience this with her, see how she takes it, and if she gets upset, then for the sake of giving her a happy experience on her birthday, it might be okay to give it up.

You will always be her aunt, you can spend time with her anytime.\n\nHer BF on the other hand, there is no guarantee their relation will last forever and this concert can be a good (or bittersweet) memories for them.", "I\u2019m just shocked at how ungrateful your niece is with this all being her idea.

You will attend the concert with one if your friends instead.", "YWNBTA - no way. \n\nMaybe I'm old-fashioned but that is a rude ask! That was a present/experience for you and her to share and then she goes and asks her bf to go instead of you?? RUDE!!", "Wow. People are being really harsh on your niece. NAH except maybe your niece's mom for stepping in rather than talking to your niece about what it might mean to you, and getting your niece to talk to you herself. \n\nYou're not going to be the asshole for keeping the ticket and the original plan but please remember what it's like to be 16. Your friends and dates mean The World and you mostly wish any adults in your family even the coolest of adults in your family, would leave you alone and let you live your teenage life. You already said she doesn\u2019t have friends who would be excited for this concert, so the fact that she has a boyfriend who would go is particularly significant. Did you tell your niece that you would go with us since she didn\u2019t have any friends to take her? Because if that\u2019s the case, it also makes sense that she would think now that she has a boyfriend who likes Taylor Swift, he could go instead.\n\nWhich is why it would also be OK to let the boyfriend go with her. Like that would be a nice gesture towards recognizing her relationship and her independence, but it would also be totally legit for you to want to go and experience this with her.

I get that you want to go, but just imagine how much happier she'll be if her bf can go with her? I get that you wanted to be the cool aunt taking her niece to the show, but she's at an age (assuming) where she would rather be with her bf. Put yourself in her shoes, what would you want?

Why pass up that opportunity? \n\nSo while you may not really be TA one way or another it's sort of just neutral to me. But if you'd sell the ticket to the bf you'd definitely be the coolest aunt imo. She's a teenager, I'm sure she'll be close with you once she's an adult and you aren't even a massive fan of Taylor anyways. If you were as much a fan of Taylor as she was or anywhere near, I'd probably think differently a bit even despite it being a gift.

Why doesn't she pay the OP a few thousand dollars so this boy can go in her place?", "This.\n\nOP, your gift to your niece was to take her on this experience - you gave her one ticket as a promise that you would take her for an incredible evening together. She will have many opportunities to have fun with the boyfriend, but this is special auntie-niece time.\n\nI'd say call her but if she is anything like my daughters she doesn't actually answer her phone very often and best responds through texts. Text her (and her Mom) this:\n\n\"Hey (name). I got kind of an odd call from your Mom. I wanted to respond personally to you. When I gave you the Swift ticket it was to give you an experience we could share together - kind of like a trip. I understand you want to go to the concert with your boyfriend, but the answer is no., I am not giving him my ticket. I, too, want to go to the concert and have been looking forward to it for quite some time. I'd love for you to come with me but if you do not want to go now I'll take the ticket back and get you something else as a gift and instead invite someone who wants to share an awesome evening with me.\"\n\nThis text serves two purposes.

Give her a break", "But she was not 'already going'. She arranged the whole thing so they can go and have fun together.\nI understand what you are trying to say, but in my eyes the fact that the aunt wanted to take her niece to her favourite consert, which I understand was very hard to get tickets for is part of what makes the present thoughtful and the request even more rude.\nTelling her she was already going deminish the thoughtfulness of the present.\nSIL should have explained her daughter how presents work and never should have put OP in this position", "\ud83d\udcaf the niece needs someone to show her how inappropriate the ask really was.", "Maybe you are insufferably boring?", "\ud83d\udcaf", "OP said she\u2019s a TS fan just not as huge as the niece", "If she gets that upset about it, I would never get her another gift.

NTA.", "Not just made plans, but the aunt is the one that BOUGHT both tickets in the first place. And not even intentionally for the niece, those are HER tickets and she just happened to offer one to her niece. That girl is so much TA here and if I was the aunt I would have taken the ticket back and gone with someone else.", "I feel like the mom is kind of the asshole for not explaining to the daughter that this is a very special gift and she can't swap her aunt out bc she has a boyfriend", "Teenagers and long-term rational thinking do not always go hand-in-hand.\n\nWhich make sense, they aren't wired up that way yet.

Don't be angry etc, just forceful", "Then she should definitely go, regardless.", "I remember when she switched from country to pop, I thought \"Why would she do that? She's a very successful country singer.\" Apparently, she knows what she's doing and doesn't need any career advice from me.", "The majority of her fans are people that grew up with her, the vast majority are adults in their 20s and 30s", "> That girl\u2019s mother could have and should have nipped that behavior in the bud.\n\nTotally. If my niece did that I'd go LC and  get her socks for all following presents just for asking.", "Agreed. \n\nThe fact that Mom even entertained this suggestion tells me the girl is pretty used to getting her own way.", "Yup, this is the answer. The niece is riding high on hormones and new love. This is not a rational state of mind. It\u2019s moms job to step and try to explain reality to her. Instead she passed the buck so she didn\u2019t have to be the bad guy.", "If she is such a big fan she won't be mad for long.", "Yeah, I wonder how many of those actually ever sell at that price vs professional speculators or Ticketmaster and ppl just figuring I'll go bc it'll be fun, but if I can get $2k, why not.\n\nThere's a reason so many are available.", "Someone offered me 10k for my 3 floor seats.", "There was an article about how someone bought 4 tickets for $21k for one of the MA shows", "Will congress finally take action on the ticketmaster monopoly?

If I wanted to  resell my tickets, well I've seen comparables go for 7k each.", "No, that's actually one of the things media analysts write about all the time - while she does have many adult fans, she's one of the few pop stars who manages to attract mostly younger audiences even as she's aged herself. Her fans are a mix of long-term fans who are adults and a loooooooot of teenagers.", "Lol, their parents do (or aunts). With this logic no one would ever go to concerts before they had a job.", "I'm 29 and I first heard her in early middle school in her debut era. We're the ones who grew up with her. I still can't afford tickets!", "That would just be mean. It was a gift. And teenagers are not always rational", "Such a Reddit way to insult everyone on this sub.

Also, most states that don't have scalping laws use other laws and regulations like usary, price gouging and fraud laws to prosecute scalpers.", "There are two states that permit it. NY is one. Some bands, like The Cure and A7X, have worked with ticketmaster to prevent this scalping from happening and keeping tickets affordable.  Look up what they're doing due to state laws.\n\nThen there is Aerosmith and Bruce Springsteen who are simple selling g fave value tickets at the astronomical prices to prevent scalpers a d pocketing the money themselves. \n\nOr Garth Brooks who floods the market with supply. A show sells out, he adds another. He's done 8 shows in a row in one city before. I think even 2 a day. I believe it was in Canada.", "NO, LET THEM PUN!", "I was listening to a country music station on the radio and Romeo and Juliet came on. That\u2019s not a country song and Taylor is not a country artist. I have no idea what the programmer was thinking. I called to complain. You\u2019re right, not everybody likes her and if they do, they aren\u2019t listening to a country station.", "Yes, the oldest is early thirties, hence she is between the ages of 28 and 42, and a millennial.

I had said in my original post that the \u201cniblings\u201d are Millennials/Zoomers. Isn\u2019t Zoomer a nickname for GenZ? I wasn\u2019t implying all of the niblings were Millennials. Actually the youngest might even be Alpha, and frankly she\u2019s no better. Anyway, the reference to the younger generations is just a side comment on my post. Basically I got burned out on the ingratitude, and this post really rankled.", "I said they are millennials and Zoomers. Isn\u2019t Zoomer a nickname for GenZ?", "It's crazy to me the standards some people seem to have for a 16 year old.

That's so exciting! Aunt OP isn't even a huge Swiftie, I'm sure she wouldn't mind selling her ticket fo bf so we can go together for my birthday!\"\n\nLike, the whole \"spirit\" of the gift and how it would look to ask the giver of an expensive gift to give even more wouldn't have even entered my mind. It just wouldn't have occurred to me. Until, of course, I pitched the idea to my mom. She would have shot that shit down immediately and explained why. Neice's mom is the one really dropping the ball here.", "And if they are forever, hopefully by 30 he\u2019ll be like \u201cyeah we barely knew each other, it made way more sense for you to go with your aunt.\u201d", "Same!

Who can even afford that!?", "I would say yes. The production value is off the charts, and this particular tour is a 3 hour set list. My wife and I got floor seats for about $400 each, and it was worth every penny. \n\n\nWas it $5k good though? Not in my current tax bracket", "Same. I saw Paul McCartney around 1990 & I know the ticket price wasn\u2019t too outrageous. I want to say around $150. Of course that was pre-internet so there wasn\u2019t the outrageous secondary market we see today. There were very few options available for getting tickets. Buying tickets online is so much more convenient but it gave rise to the ability to command crazy prices for tickets.", "Looks a lot like him, too.
