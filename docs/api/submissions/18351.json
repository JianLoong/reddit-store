You take your niece to Taylor Swift. It's my understanding that the tickets are quite difficult to get. You and your niece should go and have a good time. Remember, it is YOU who bought the tickets with your own money. Your niece has only known her boyfriend for a short period of time, so stop doubting yourself. Enjoy the concert!", "NTA No one should have offered your ticket without asking you first and then kind of guilting you into giving it away. It doesn't really matter if he is willing to pay you for the ticket, it was not meant for him.", "NTA. Talk to your niece (directly; her going through her mother was a bit rude). You gave her a ticket, with a promise of this experience together. Tell her it's important to you that the two of you share this.\n\nYour niece is kind of an AH for asking (especially *not* asking, but having her mom do it). She wants to give this to her boyfriend of a few weeks. You're her aunt and that relationship matters. It's okay to tell her you're hurt by that.\n\nEnjoy the concert with your niece!", "NTA. You bought the tickets so you both can go. Just cause she got a boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it up. It\u2019s Taylor Swift, even if you aren\u2019t as big a fan as she is, it\u2019s still gonna be dope", "NTA, the gift you gave your niece was one ticket to a concert. You were explicit at the time that you also had a ticket and would go with your niece. You are under no obligation to relinquish your ticket to the show.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hate this for you.\n\nThis is the longest I've ever had to think about a reply.  I would not sell the ticket or give it to the boyfriend.  I think it's a bad lesson to teach.  \n\nWhen you accept an invitation or say yes = you mean yes.  That includes if you get a 'better invitation' (or a new boyfriend).  Your word is your bond.\n\nShe's likely going to have many more boyfriends.  You are the one who put the effort into getting the tickets.\n\nAlso, she didn't ask you herself.  Her Mom asked.", "NTA. She's sixteen. In a couple years she will barely remember this boyfriend's name and not give two figs for his opinion. But she will remember having a special experience with her aunt who went all out to do something amazing for her. It was very inappropriate for your SIL to even ask that you forfeit such a significant monetary and sentimental cost in favor of some high school boyfriend of a few weeks.", "NTA- why would she even think of that? You bought the tickets to take her with you. This isn't just about her being a fan, you are too. What else does the kid get, just because she wants it?", "NTA, and your niece needs a serious reality check. That\u2019s one of the rudest, most entitled reactions I\u2019ve ever read to a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA.  It's rude of them to ask, since part of why you came up with this present was as a way for the two of you to spend time together.  Especially since she's only been dating this fellow for a few weeks.\n\nTell her that you've been looking forward to spending the time with her and sharing the concert experience.  Suggest that you'd be glad to meet her boyfriend and offer to plan and pay for another event for the three of you.", "NTA, while your SIL asking you instead of her daughter doesn't feel nice but considering this is a 16 year old here the best is to talk to her directly and tell her that you really want to go to the concert with her, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and of course a bonding experience too.   \ncommunication is the key   \ni hope it goes well!", "NTA and it was beyond rude of her to volunteer your ticket to her boyfriend. This was a thoughtful gift. She can either go with you and be damned grateful, or you can take someone else. Her pick.", "NTA. It\u2019s ludicrous that she and her mother think it\u2019s okay to propose this change. They should never have even referenced this to the guy, and you should not give up your ticket. The audacity of people these days. We have lost our selfish, selfish minds.", "NTA. But your sister kind of sucks for even bringing this to you.  She should have told her daughter/your niece how rude this would be and shut it down immediately.  She just didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy, but she should parent better.", "NTA. Tell her you got the tickets for you too and that you look forward to going with her. In 10 years she won't even remember that boys name.", "NTA. Sixteen years old is not too young to learn that it's entitled and rude to receive a gift and turn around to ask for two gifts, which is what niece is doing re: the single ticket she was given.", "NTA", "NTA...the gift was yours to share with her.  If you don't really care about the concert you could always sell him the ticket (don't give it to him) and have a dinner date with her before.  If you want to go, just tell her that you have been looking forward to your \"date\" and don't want to give up your ticket.  She should never have asked him about a ticket that wasn't hers to offer.", "NTA - Talk to her directly. Tell her that you intended it to be a bonding experience and that you\u2019d really like to go with her! You should also add that though you are happy she is happy in her relationship, you were hurt by her asking her boyfriend about the concert because you thought it was clear the trip with for the two of you, especially since the concert was planned BEFORE her relationship. Don\u2019t guilt trip her, but you should be honest.", "Wnbta. Tell the SiL that you only bought the ticket for her birthday to JOIN you. As you were already going. Tell her she can either go with you or purchase their own tix and you can either sell them or go with someone else. Second option... sell them the ticket and never bother to do that type of thing again.", "OP yes you bought it for the memory of you and her to go, and she's only been going out with him for a few weeks.  However is she going to be less enthused going with you and potentially being snarky during your outing so neither of you are going to really enjoying yourselves?  This is the question you have to ask yourself.  If you're willing to deal with the potential tween negativity of a 16 y/o girl then more power to you and hopefully she'll be just as enthused as you will be.  It's just something to consider and something you may consider talking to her mom about since she was afraid to ask you herself.", "NTA and rude to ask personally I\u2019d ask the niece to pay for the ticket to fuck with her and be like \u201cjk lol\u201d", "That would be the last I treat her to anything. Some people have a lot of nerve.", "Nta, tell both of them you bought the tickets specifically so you could spend time with her and to share the experience with her. You went out of the way to get tickets for a concert that is extremely hard to get for you and her. Not for her and her boyfriend. She offered the ticket up before asking you about it. She sounds entitled and your sil is entitled too. Put your foot down about it. Tell her she has 2 options. Go with you like you originally planned or don\u2019t go at all and give up her ticket. If they try to gaslight you or make you feel guilty for something YOU bought, I\u2019d take away the tickets and go with a friend who\u2019ll actually want to spend time with you and just give her cash as a replacement since she thinks she can so easily replace you. If she wants to sulk, she can sulk at home the day of the concert with her boyfriend.", "YWNBTA You bought her one ticket and you bought yourself the other ticket. It's incredibly rude of all of them to assume you don't want to go and have already floated the idea to the boyfriend.   \n\n\nListen, I've been to the Eras Tour twice. It's amazing. Don't be guilted into giving up your ticket. Your niece is incredibly lucky to even be going. Resale of those tickets are in the $1000s. I can't get over any of them thinking it's okay to casually offer your ticket to someone else. You didn't buy your niece two tickets. You bought her one.", "YWNBTA but this is one of those times where I feel like it's worth remembering that not being an asshole is a pretty low bar. If it's *a gift for her* and she wants to go with her boyfriend, and the boy in question is someone her mom trusts enough for that, then it's probably better to just let the boyfriend comp you for the ticket and the two of them go together.", "NTA .. BUT!!!\n\nIf you're not a \"huge fan\" then it would be nice of you to let her bf pay you for the ticket (even nicer to just let her have 2 tickets as her present) and let them go together. \n\nIn general when I have given tickets to people as a gift, I give them 2 tickets and let them choose who they want to go with them. If they choose me, then that's awesome, but I always let them know that they don't have to go with me. The 2 tickets are theirs to do with as they will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a TS concert, super. But your niece is 16. I understand she will prefer spending the evening her way in order to fully enjoy it.

They were meant for bonding time between you.  \n\nPoint out that in polite society etiquette dictates that one doesn't change their mind and go to another party considered more desirable, when already expected at a party.

Sure, she could have an equally lovely time with her boyfriend, and sure, in time it might turn out that he 'the one', but there's more chance at her age he'll be an ex sometime soon. It's not something you can say to her now, but if that happens, she'll just have a memory of the going to Taylor Swift with her ex. You, on the other hand, will never be a ex auntie.", "NTA but also, since it was her mother that brought it up I kinda assumed SHE wanted to go. Maybe that boyfriend isn't in the picture by the time the concert happens and she needs someone to go? Anyway, you're allowed to have experiences planned, enjoy the show!", "F-that. Go to the concert. Your niece is a bit of a cow, her mum, too. YWNBTA. That was a very generous gift. You are a good aunt.", "YWNBTA. Your niece is ungrateful and rude and your SIL seems to be endorsing the behaviour. Do not let them guilt you into giving up the tickets. \nTell your SIL that your gift was your nieces ticket not yours. That you already planned your trip as you really like the artist too and don\u2019t intend to give up your ticket.

Unfortunately some people are just ungrateful and your niece has A LOT of growing to do. I suggest you take this situation into consideration when planning next years gifts. \nAnd most importantly- have fun at the concert no matter what the niece decides! I hear it is spectacular and truly a show worth seeing. <3", "NTA. It's for your niece's bday, yes, but you bought the tickets and you like Taylor's music. You have been excited and looking forward to the event with the intention of spending quality time with your niece. You don't have to be a hardcore fan like your niece to justify you going. Again, you bought the tickets. You bought them for you and her, not her and a guest of her choosing. It was honestly rude of her to even suggest to her new boyfriend that he could take your place and to get her mom to ask you. She didn't even ask you herself -- I think because deep down she knows it's not right because she knows you'll be hurt and/or disappointed. Sixteen year olds can be thoughtless (as shown by the suggestion of the ticket swap), but they aren't stupid.\n\nIf your niece's new boyfriend wants to go to the concert, he can buy an exorbitantly priced ticket from a reseller because that's what I'd expect for him to pay you, if you were willing to give up your spot. If he can't afford it and/or is only willing to pay original ticket price, then that is extremely laughable. If sil has anything negative to say, than she can help him buy one. I honestly can't believe sil had the gall to even text you to ask. Those tickets were not easy to get. You would only be the AH if you said yes because you'd be doing a disservice to yourself. If your niece gets upset, she'll get over by the time the concert rolls around. Again she's sixteen and it's a brand new relationship. She'll definitely get over it.\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar.", "YWNBTA. I totally understand that you want to enjoy the experience with your niece and you were looking forward to it.\n\nThat said, the niece is a teenager and is probably swept up in the excitement of having a new boyfriend. She might genuinely be pissed off and sulk at the concert if she\u2019s not mature enough to accept that you\u2019d rather go to the concert with her. \n\nI guess the point is that it\u2019s not really about the money and who spent money on what. It\u2019s about the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s your call. Giving her boyfriend the ticket and letting them experience it will likely make her happier in the short term. Of course in the long term she will remember good memories with her family and loved ones much more. But having been a teenager myself, I know that if my aunt insisted on going with me when I wanted to go with my bae would lead me into an angry sulk. Similarly, my sister is much younger than me and if I bought tix for us to experience something together and she wanted to with her boyfriend instead, I know she would get annoyed if I insisted on going with her. I\u2019m thinking that maybe you can try having the conversation with her that you\u2019d love to go with her and experience this with her, see how she takes it, and if she gets upset, then for the sake of giving her a happy experience on her birthday, it might be okay to give it up. Adults sacrifice a lot of things for the young people in their life and that\u2019s how it often has to be.", "If my aunt got me pricey tickets to a show for a musician I loved, and then I asked my parents to ask my aunt to give up her ticket so I could bring this guy I started dating two weeks later, they'd tell my aunt to take both tickets back.

They are in their honeymoon phase and can only think of each other.\n\nHonestly, I say sell the ticket to the BF. Your niece will appreciate you more this way. You will always be her aunt, you can spend time with her anytime.\n\nHer BF on the other hand, there is no guarantee their relation will last forever and this concert can be a good (or bittersweet) memories for them.", "I\u2019m just shocked at how ungrateful your niece is with this all being her idea. You are too kind an aunt, and she\u2019s undeserving of your generosity", "NTA it is really rude they even asked you to give up your concert ticket. Tell them if your niece would rather go with her boyfriend, she can give back her ticket and her boyfriend can buy two tickets for them. You will attend the concert with one if your friends instead.", "YWNBTA - no way. \n\nMaybe I'm old-fashioned but that is a rude ask! That was a present/experience for you and her to share and then she goes and asks her bf to go instead of you?? RUDE!!", "Wow. People are being really harsh on your niece. NAH except maybe your niece's mom for stepping in rather than talking to your niece about what it might mean to you, and getting your niece to talk to you herself. \n\nYou're not going to be the asshole for keeping the ticket and the original plan but please remember what it's like to be 16. Your friends and dates mean The World and you mostly wish any adults in your family even the coolest of adults in your family, would leave you alone and let you live your teenage life. You already said she doesn\u2019t have friends who would be excited for this concert, so the fact that she has a boyfriend who would go is particularly significant. Did you tell your niece that you would go with us since she didn\u2019t have any friends to take her? Because if that\u2019s the case, it also makes sense that she would think now that she has a boyfriend who likes Taylor Swift, he could go instead.\n\nWhich is why it would also be OK to let the boyfriend go with her. Like that would be a nice gesture towards recognizing her relationship and her independence, but it would also be totally legit for you to want to go and experience this with her.

OP also wants to attend too.", "Are you the bf by any chance?", "I read on here someone who bought nose bleed tickets 2 for $155 originally now are reselling at 2,500. That\u2019s INSANE", "I mean he\u2019s 16 (presumably, hopefully) so he probably doesn\u2019t know any of that. But yeah YWNBTA, it\u2019s ridiculously infeasible.", "Apparently, pretty intense, heard people who didn\u2019t get tickets have been camping outside venues and having their own \u201cpseudo\u201d concerts. I didn\u2019t know how intense it was either.", "There's no need for guerilla marketing, these tickets sell out in a matter of minutes, even in huge venues like Lincoln Financial (where the Philadelphia Eagles play).", "Saw a teen girl practically burst into tears at hearing someone else had won tickets a clever local marketer was giving away. (Turned out a scammer was afoot and she still stands a chance of winning. I'm rooting for her...)", "Well it would make sense for there to be more posts about it at a time when tickets are being sold. It's not like the posts are gonna pop up when there's no concerts.", "That fandom is something else.\n\nAnd the majority of them are young girls, AKA people who always worried about being AITA.", "The fandom is something else. \n\nThere was a whole fiasco with even getting tickets and re-sale is insane.", "I'm in an unrelated fandom and soooooo many people in it are obsessed with Taylor Swift", "Yeah I was thinking that! So sick of parents acting this way. It's so immature. Giving in to your kids every whim is just going to create an entitled monster - it's straight up terrible parenting and isn't fair to the kids.", "Yep.  If I had tried that shit with my mom she would have told me I was being rude and ungrateful and I either go with my aunt or my aunt gets to take someone else.  And it would not be an empty threat- my ass would be staying home if she heard anything else about it", "Millenials are aged 27 to 42 now. OP is likely a Millenial.", "You call people in their 30s niblings?", "I feel like that\u2019s a bit harsh. The niece just asked if she could bring her bf, who sounds like he might be a fan too, rather than her aunt. I mean as an adult you can see why that would be rude but as a kid you just want to spend time with your bf so I\u2019m not really going to fault her on that. I will side eye the mom though for not putting a stop to this from the get go though. There is no reason OP should have ever been asked to do this.", "That's the parents fault - punishing the kids isn't going to fix the behaviour. Talking to them would but you're apparently too immature to realise that and would rather cut them off, like a teenager having a strop", "If she decides to pout and ruin the concert for both of them ... Let her.  She'll realize later and remember what an asshole she was to her aunt on her 16th bday.  It can be a growing moment.  We all had them.", "So plenty of time for them to go to a different concert together then?", "Why the downvotes lmao", "I\u2019m still married to mine \n38 and counting", "Yeah, one of my friends has been with the same guy for like 4 years, and they\u2019ve been together since they were 15. It\u2019s the longest high school relationship I\u2019ve ever seen", "Why in the hell does this have 211 downvotes?! Christ redditors are such brain numb herd voters.", "Of course he knows the resale value of the tickets.  My 14yo daughter knew exactly how much our tickets were from the day we bough them to the day we went to the concert.  Not because she wanted to sell them.  NOT because she was bragging about them.  \n\nBut because the craziness of just getting these tickets, to how much they go for now, to the class action lawsuit is reported and posted everywhere.", ">so he probably doesn\u2019t know any of that\n\nAre you kidding?  Lmao - *they all know*.  Tickets at 2 and a half grand now - they\u2019ll be SO MUCH MORE on the day in front of the stadium.  Who knows if this boYfriEnd might even get separated from her & \u2018lost in the crowd\u2019 on the way in.  Meanwhile, he ends up with a new 2nd hand car or computer gaming set-up or something.   smh\n\nNTA!!   ***Don\u2019t even think of it, OP!***", "dude someone got hired as her security guard because he couldn't get tickets like crazy fucking shit.", "My daughter said over 20,000 outside the stadium in Philly", "You mean to say, they sell out pretty swift?", "Taylor Swift has been a megastar for well over a decade. I'm pretty sure the majority of her fans are far more likely to be adults who can make and spend their own money.", "From being at two of the aforementioned concerts I would say most of us are young adults at this point. Personally I\u2019m 24 and have been listening to her since I was 8. Lots of people in my age range to almost 10 years older than me that feel like we grew up with Taylor, either because they are actually the same age as her or because she made music for everything you went through, before you even went through it.", "Op is thirty bruh not sure where you got that second fact from", "Completely wrong. I\u2019m not a fan of Swifts music, in fact I think it is absolute pop garbage but her fans are not majority younger girls. EVERYONE loves her music. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it not even Beyonc\u00e9. And I\u2019ll give it to Swift she puts on massive shows for these people so even though I don\u2019t like her music I absolutely respect her as an artist and for how she treats her fandom. Also just the amount of stalkers she has to deal with is insane.", "Idk where you think the majority are young girls; younger girls don't exactly have TS money like the 20-30 year olds that have been listening to her for years.", "I don't think a sixteen year old, or an almost sixteen year old, is too young to know better. I think at that age, it's easy to get caught up in the moment and not fully think through the consequences of actions and how it'll affect others. Teenagers know when something is inherently right or wrong. If her niece didn't, then she wouldn't have asked through her mother.", "Millennial are the new Peter Pan generation. \n\nThey are stuck being thought of as teen aged.", "They are a range of ages from early teens to early 30s", "Niblings is a gender neutral term for your sibling\u2019s kids. They\u2019re saying that their nieces/nephews are that age.", "We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. The niece is 16, not 6, and she is asking the aunt to disinvite herself from a concert in favor of some dude she\u2019s dated for like five minutes. She is absolutely wrong for this, and we need to start expecting better manners from someone who is two years from adulthood. The mother is also wrong for enabling that entitled behavior.", "Reading comprehension is fundamental. Nowhere did I say I \u201ccut them off.\u201d They were all spoken to about gratitude, they didn\u2019t change, and now I don\u2019t go the extra mile on generous gifts. They aren\u2019t entitled to anything anyway, I never got anything from any of my aunts and uncles growing up. You do what you want with your nieces and nephew when you get them, and I will do what I want with mine.", "If there\u2019s even a hint of this, OP should just go with a friend and let the niece hang out with her precious boyfriend who she\u2019s totally going to be with forever and get married to because that\u2019s how teenage relationships work.", "This isn\u2019t just any concert. People are paying thousands for these tickets. The pre-sale crashed ticket master.", "Big town still married", "Because there are a lot of teenagers on Reddit. I thought I was going crazy at first and then I realized how many of these people are literally in high school and it all made sense.", "The ticket is worth thousands. Surely the bf doesn't expect it to be sold at the same price she bought it?", "You need to go now.", "Very clever how you taylored your response to use her name!", "Jail. Jail for you. Now.", "That's why he said \"majority\"", "I respect your decision to agree to disagree but I just wanted to say 16 is like the peak age of \u2018main character syndrome\u2019. Kids that age think they\u2019re old enough to be adults, and want to be treated as such, but they don\u2019t quite have the tools or experiences to gracefully navigate the adult world yet. Also I feel like it\u2019s harsh to fault her for asking since it\u2019s not like she sulked or had a tantrum for having her request turned down (yet). To be fair, my judgement will 100% change depending on her reaction for being denied her request.", "The exception that proves the rule and you know it. Don't be obtuse.", "I\u2019ll second that"]}
