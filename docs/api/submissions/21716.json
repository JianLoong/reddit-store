Last night, a friend of hers from school passed away. She was very sick and ended up having multi-organ failure and being rushed to the ICU. For the next week, nobody really knew whether she was going to make it or not, but she went into cardiac arrest and they had to do an emergency surgery.\n\nThe girl didn't make it, and it's heartbreaking as a mother and as a nurse to see what the parents and family are going through. I told my daughter this morning. My daughter is a very independent person, and hates having to share anything with anyone, including her feelings. She was smiling and telling me she was fine and not to worry because they weren't that close, but something didn't feel right to me. \n\nSo I spoke to another one of the mum's at her school, and learned that this girl and my daughter were actually very good friends, and have been close for three years. I was hurt for my daughter, as she's still only 14 and just lost someone who was apparently very close with her. She had an appointment with her therapist early this morning, and while she went to the bathroom, I asked her therapist to tell me anything regarding her friend that she may have said.\n\nWhen we got home, my daughter yelled at me saying she was fine and I was smothering her. She said that I was trying to get involved in something that didn't even matter to her and that she hates me for making this about me. I admit, I lost my cool. I yelled back that she lied to me, I knew her and this girl were friends and it wasn't healthy for her to grieve alone. She already has a mental health illness, and she is being spiteful and lashing out for no reason.\n\nI regret yelling, but I meant what I said. She hasn't left her room since and refuses to talk or eat. My son told me to leave her alone because this was her friend not mine and my husband said that \"if they weren't friends then who cares?\". I can see that she's hurting, I know she's in pain and grieving the loss of someone close to her, but she lied to me and won't open up.\n\nI fear that if she continues to grieve alone, her mental health will decline massively, but I don't know what to do anymore.

Why are you even here asking?", "YTA\n\nYou could have asked her therapist if there was something you could do to help your daughter, based on their assessment.\n\nBut you asked about what your daughter told her I confidence. I sincerely hope the therapist didn't tell you anything.\n\nIf this is how you usually act it's not surprising your daughter doesn't share with you. I'm clearly seeing you as the type of mother who reads their daughter's journal out of \"concern\".", "YTA because therapy isn't about you getting info on your daughter so it's utterly inappropriate to ask. \n\nShe isn't being spiteful and lashing out.

The point of a therapist is that it's a safe person to talk to who won't share that information.

Your daughter is clearly talking to her therapist about her friend\u2019s death, so she is not going through it alone. If the therapist is worried about your daughter harming herself or others, the therapist will let you know. That\u2019s what therapists do, they keep everything private unless they get the impression that their client, especially a minor, is going to do something like that. Let your daughter talk to her therapist without your interference. If there\u2019s anything serious, your daughter\u2019s therapist will let you know.

One is understandable but the other is not only a violation of her privacy but putting her relationship & trust in her therapist at risk. \nAlso, saying a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD is being \u201cspiteful\u201d when they are grieving their friend is kinda messed up IMO.

Confidentiality is a thing).", "YTA!! Individuals grieve differently to include your own daughter. As healthcare worker you should know better than asking the therapist to snitch on your daughter.

There\u2019s a reason she doesn\u2019t trust you enough to speak to you about how she\u2019s doing, and you just shared that reason with the internets.

Or you should.\n\nIf you are actually a nurse like you say you are, you know precisely the kind of importance we, as healthcare professionals, place on patient privacy.  Assuming this is in the States, you just asked your daughter's therapist to violate HIPAA for you.  And I hope with everything I am that her therapist informed you of how WILDLY unethical that is.\n\nUnless your daughter is at risk of harming herself or others, that therapist is duty-bound to keep her confidence. That's it. End of discussion.\n\nBack off and let your daughter and her therapist work this out.

If she wanted to talk to you about it, she would. The fact that she doesn't says more about your guys' relationship than it does her own mental health tbf. Kids need space, ESPECIALLY during their THERAPY sessions. I know after my Mom chimed in on my session when I didn't even know she could hear me- I did not feel safe to continue therapy in her home when I knew she couldn't give me the privacy I deserved. Therapy requires one to feel safe to express their feelings without judgement, and you do not sound like the kind of person who will do that for your daughter.

So the best way to help her feel safe, loved, and like she can speak her mind to you is to yell at her, right? /s\n\nYou done f***ed up. \n\nShe\u2019s not going to disclose anything to you when she doesn\u2019t feel like you can be trusted with her emotions. You proved you can\u2019t be trusted. \n\nAll you can do now is apologise - sincerely - take responsibility for how royally you screwed this up. Tell her you\u2019ll stay out of her private affairs and you realise it\u2019s inappropriate to try to make her tell you anything she\u2019s not comfortable with. Let her know grief is a process and it has to happen on her own timeline, that she\u2019ll have private access to her therapist for as long as she needs with the ONLY caveat being that if she\u2019s at risk, then you\u2019ll be told. Otherwise, if the therapists shares anything it will be because she and the therapist agreed it would be a good idea for you to know and that she has consented to that sharing. \n\nAnd then get yourself into therapy. You\u2019re obviously under a great deal of stress and it\u2019s impacting you negatively. You said you\u2019re a nurse? Are you experiencing carer burnout? Because in the face of an objective tragedy, your response really lacked any empathy for your child. Lack of ability to access empathy is a big warning sign of emerging or established burnout. Burnout is not an excuse to be an AH though. \n\nDo all of that and you MAY have a chance of repairing your relationship with your daughter after this massive AH move, and you MAY have the opportunity to build trust with her before she reached the end of her adolescence. I can tell you - 18 and adulthood feels like it\u2019s a lifetime away, but it will literally fly by before your very eyes and if you don\u2019t take some action now, you\u2019re looking at a very compromised relationship with your kid as she heads toward and starts adulthood. \n\nVery gently, because I think there\u2019s more going on here than an AITA post can capture - so very gently but I really want you to hear me - YTA. But you don\u2019t have to keep being one. You clearly love your daughter. Set yourself up to do better and have a healthy relationship with her.", "YTA. You asked her therapist to commit a serious breach of ethics. I'm not sure this particular incident of wanting to understand how and why your daughter is hurting really counts as smothering. But you really are throwing some red flags for more smothering behavior in general. In particular, she's not the only one who distrusts your motives: it sounds like the rest of your family does too. I would say you need to let this go, but it sounds to me like there are a lot of things you need to let go.", "YTA. You could have just told her therapist that her close friend died and she wasn't willing to talk to you about it. Then it would have been up to the expert in psychology to know how far to push her to open up and how best to support her. There was no good reason so go behind her back to hear her thoughts that she wanted to keep private from you.

OP sounds like a narcissistic AH!!!!!", "Right? No wonder the kid doesn't trust her mother enough to open up to her.", "laws around this are a lot looser when a minor is involved, unfortunately", "At 14 that would largely depend on whether the daughter was considered legally competent to provide her own consent. Not only CAN therapists disclose what they think is important to parents (Although best practice would be to gain the child\u2019s consent to do so first) but in some instances, usually involving risk, they MUST inform parents. \n\nIt gets clearer, at least in my country, after 16 years, where unless there\u2019s an impairment that would render the kid legally incompetent to provide consent, they can give their own and stop the flow of info if they choose. But when mum and/or dad are paying the bill, it\u2019s something that sometimes needs to be carefully negotiated. Some parents won\u2019t allow their kids to attend if they feel they\u2019re not getting enough info about their kids therapy. So, therapists often have to careful negotiate that with the kid and provide enough that the kid has consented to keep parents happy. \n\nI suspect that this parent is one of those who might trade a threat to withdraw therapy if she felt she was losing control/didn\u2019t have access to undo.", "That was my thought as well: the daughter doesn't see OP as someone safe to confide in. That isn't a situation that you can argue your way out of.", "Not anymore. OP made sure of that.", "No, she simply told me that it wasn't in her job description to help \"nosy parents\" and \"I'm here to help the kid, not you.\" which I thought was rude and unprofessional of her.", "It was 100% professional and you are the one being rude.", "The therapist is legally bound not tell anyone what a client says during a therapy session unless anything they say could lead to the patient hurting themselves, hurting someone else, or if someone else has been hurt since therapists are mandated reporters.
