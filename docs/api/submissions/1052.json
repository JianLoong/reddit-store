{"id": 1052, "submission_id": "ylg8p3", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my SIL my bf\u2019s recipes, causing her young children to go hungry?", "selftext": "I (27M) have been with my boyfriend (25M) since I was 17 and he was 16. Since I met him he's loved to cook and bake. Since we were both broke teens saving for uni, at all of our early anniversaries he used to cook dinner for us and bake dessert.\n\nWhen we got a house together last year one of the things he really wanted was a big kitchen. And that became one of our non negotiable while house hunting.\n\nAlso he's really close with his dad. His dad was the one who taught him how to cook.\n\nOver the past 9 months his dad has gotten pretty ill and he's been going to see him often, and one of the things they decided to do was to cook every dish they knew (over the course of months) takes pictures of each dish with one of those polaroid/instax style cameras and make a recipe book.\n\nMost of these were just generic dishes they made together, some with personal twists, but a few of them were dishes either his dad had made up or that they had made up together. His dad also wrote personal notes to my bf on each of the photos.\n\nNeedless to say this recipe book is very important to him, and became even more special when his dad passed last month.\n\nWhen this happened I was ready to give him time to grieve, start picking up more chores and take over cooking, thinking he would want a break. But instead he started cooking and baking like crazy, he ended up cooking almost every recipe. I guess it was just his way of mourning his father.\n\nOver the past week he's been getting better, talking about his feelings more and such.\n\nYesterday my brother, his wife, their two children (3F, 5F) and his MIL came over and my boyfriend had made lunch and dessert.\n\nMy brother\u2019s kids loved it. So my SIL asked what it was called, my bf explained that they were unique recipes that belonged to his dad and then my SIL asked if she could have them. My bf said no, but that he was willing to make the dishes for her kids regularly. Her mother then chimed in and told my bf that that wouldn't do and that he shouldn't be selfish and share the recipes with the children.\n\nMy bf clearly got uncomfortable so i got in between them and told them if they are going to be disrespectful to him then he will have to leave. They started saying I was being over dramatic and that they were just recipes. I told them that they had sentimental meaning and that if he didn't want to give them to them he didn't have to.\n\nThey left with a huff. I later got a text from my brother asking what happened because what his wife and MIL were telling him didn't add up. I told him and he apologised for their action. However i got some messages from my SIL saying how her kids won't eat their food anymore and only want to eat the recipes and how I'm being cruel and starving two young children.\n\nI've just ignored them, but I have something gnawing at me telling me that I should have handled it differently and that I'm TA. so AITA?\n\nEDIT: a comment that i made that ive been told adds extra info so thought i shoudl add here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We've eaten around her place a few times, and while I've never said it to her face, its bad. we are from the uk, and there are historical reasons a lot of people don't use spices, she is 100% the stereotype. she watches my bf make a regular tomato pasta once and was baffled by the fact he added to and seasoned the passata.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>her food is bland and at best she will add some salt and pepper. also in general she doesn't really cook. what she calls cooking is putting frozen food or ready meals in the oven or microwave and she will just order out most nights.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>i put in my response to the bot but left it out of my post due to character limit. but both of my nieces have food sensory issues and she almost refuses to find ways around it, sometimes making them eat what she cooked which is why she was so excited that they like my bf's food.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>since while not as severe as my nieces, my bf also has some issues with food textures, so the entire book are safe textures and foods he likes which is also why i think she wants the recipes so bad, i think shes assuming that since he has some food sensory issues that her kids will be fine with all of the recipes.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>but this is literally the most effort shes ever put into this, my bf has even offered to help her find some simple meal ideas that her kids will like but she turned it down due to the hassle and effort.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>my bf put spices or herbs in most things and i think this just comes from growing up around spices, bc despite not having a lot my boyfriend's dad always had a full spice rack, which he gave to him when he started getting ill. i love spices and seasonings in my food but i have no idea what goes with what as i just wasn't brought up in a household that used alot of spices.", "created_utc": 1667513543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylg8p3/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sil_my_bfs_recipes/", "score": 1249, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ignore them.", "NTA. There are many reasons why people might not want to share recipes, and they are all valid. She is not entitled to something just because she wants it. If you haven't already done so, make a copy of the recipes for the kitchen and store the original in a fireproof safe. I would not put it past them to try to snoop and make copies. Bonus points if you all make changes to the decoy recipes so they taste horrible!", "Message back that since she has admitted in writing that her kids are now not being fed because she wasn't given your bf's recipes, you will have no choice but to report the matter to cps", "NTA.

Simply ridiculous!! \n\nThose recipes are *sacred* and your bf has the right to keep them a secret! I think they meaning they hold to him is beautiful! And anyone, family or not, who doesn't (or refuses) to accept that is being rude and disrespectful. Good for you for standing up and supporting your bf! \n\nYour brother's wife and MIL crossed the line. And your SIL sounds like a full-on drama queen.

He was very kind saying hed make them for her any time, too.", " Totally NTA! \n\nFirstly,  how amazing are these recipes if they are completely off ANY other food after 1 dinner & dessert?!. Complete rubbish to try and pull of a guilt trip.\n\nSecondly (and why so many people here don't get this is beyond me!), it's totally obvious why your BF doesn't want to share them. It's not about being precious, these are recipes only he and his dad know! . That's a special bond he gets to hold onto even after losing him, and once he shares them with others it would be broken.\n\nShe's clearly massively entitled and has no empathy, don't let her make you question yourself.", "NTA, and here\u2019s how you handle people asking for your recipes. Act like you don\u2019t use a recipe and it\u2019s all in your head, and verbally give them the most vague recipe you can. People will stop asking, trust me.\n\n\u201cOh you like these muffins? Thanks, I just like to try stuff out. Yeah, so you use 2 cups-ish of flour, and then some kind of leavening agent like baking soda or whatever, but not too much, just like a teaspoon or two. Some people like to add salt but I find it works fine without but that\u2019s probably because I have salt in my butter. OH YEAH so you melt the butter, like a stick\u2019s worth, like cut a square about this big and melt it, and then you can add milk or yogurt or whatever you have that\u2019s milkish. I\u2019ve never tried soy milk but it probably works too. I like to add the sugar into the liquids first, but not too much. An egg. Anyway, stir it all together with the dry until it looks right. You don\u2019t want it to be too runny. OH AND if you want to add mix-ins like chocolate chips do that at the end.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nNo children are going to starve if you don\u2019t share recipes.

He doesn\u2019t have to share the recipes and your family was really very rude. I don\u2019t think you handled it wrong at all and I think your sister in law and mother need to apologize (but they won\u2019t) I personally would NOT cook for them again.", "NTA.  Also, it's nice to hear your brother heard their version of events and went \"well, that doesn't sound right, time to get the other side of this\", rather than just believe them.", "nta. if her kids dont like her cooking then she needs to put more effort into it. her kids wont like her cooking just because of one meal, shes just trying to guilt trip you to give in and hand over the recipes. thats her problem, not any of yours.\n\nimo you re right, although they are per se just recipes, they are special to your boyfriend and if he doesnt want to share them he shouldnt have to.", "NTA. How ridiculous, entitled and disrespectful of your SIL.", "NTA - normally not sharing recipes does seem a bit antisocial but in this context everyone should respect why the recipes are important to your bf and be understanding about his way of grieving.\n\nMore importantly your SIL behaved extremely childishly. She was uncooperative and rude about something which doesn\u2019t affect her life in the grand scheme of things, she didn\u2019t try to resolve anything even when your bf gave a kind compromise. A sprinkling of ridiculous emotional blackmail on top is definitely not okay either.", "NTA  Your bf may share the recipes when he's ready, or maybe he's never ready.  They kids won't starve as I'm sure there is a can of chili in the pantry.", "NTA, for all the reasons other have listed, but as someone who also cooks a lot, I'd like to share some extra perspective.\n\nI never used to cook from recipes, but a few years ago, I decided I really wanted to perfect a few dishes. The only way for me to do that was by writing everything down, making adjustments, and trying again. I now have some recipes with more than 20 iterations. A **lot** of work has gone into them.\n\nWhen I serve these dishes to others, it's very common for them to ask me for the recipe. I find the request a little off-putting, because it doesn't respect the considerable effort I've put in to make the dishes come out just right. So, in some cases I'll politely decline. \n\nBut in other cases, I will, in fact, share the recipe... and you know what happens? Invariably, the person complains that they can't make it come out the same way. If I try to help them diagnose the problem, it's always because they've substituted something they shouldn't have, skipped a step they figured was unnecessary, used the wrong equipment, or simply lack the kitchen skills to properly follow the instructions.\n\nMy conclusion is that fielding requests for cherished recipes is a lose-lose proposition. If you decline, the person making the request sees you as unreasonable. If you accede, they'll just screw it up anyway.", "NTA. The recipe book is a lovely heirloom and I'm happy that husband has it. He shouldn't be bullied into giving the recipes, especially when he is happy to cook whenever.\n\nIf SIL's kids refuse to eat anything else that is her problem not husband's. She needs to learn better parenting skills. \n\nGood on you for looking after husband.", "NTA\nHer kids are literally going to starve she's being overly dramatic.\nGood on you for standing up for your BF.

Your SIL kids will eat when they are hungry. Your SIL should stop flapping her lips and get off her high horse. SIL really needs to grow up. MIL also needs to stay out of it. \nI feel for your BF. I have a box of old recipes that were my mothers. Some very generic and others that mean a lot to me because we came up with them together. Or tweaked some to our liking. No one knows which ones those are 100% but there are clues. Two different styles or writing is the easiest way to tell. I\u2019ve been asked for recipes and have given the generic c old school ones. Not the ones we have done. I want to keep those to myself because it was my mom. My youngest daughter knows everything and is the only one of the three daughters that have that shows any interest in learning these from ME. not just take them and try but to make them with me.

But you should make a copy for his brother, eventually. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - Your BF is entirely entitled to have his \"Secret Family Recipies\" stay secret if he wants.  Lots of people have those, even if they are cut from the back of the pudding box.  \n\nThere are several \"family recipe books\" that have been compiled and gifted to brides in ex's family.  I made 2 of them.  They are a metric shit ton of work and nothing less than a serious labor of love.  I was more than a little offended when some friend of the family that had never met the second bride wanted a copy of the book.  \n\nFrom your description, the recipe book may be handwritten by your BF's dad.  That makes the recipe book even more meaningful.  If he ever has children, the book will be an heirloom.  \n\nYour sister's children will eat when they get hungry enough.  Tell your sister to google a recipe.  There are gazillions of recipes on the net.  You can always tell her that you are not their parent, and neither is BF.  If the kids are really, truly, starving it is all on SIL and BIL as they are the custodial parents.  If you are really in a snarky mood, you can offer to notify CPS and their pediatrician.  \n\nTwo tiny suggestions, though...  1)  Make sure that SIL and MIL do not have access to the recipe book.  It's not about the recipes per see, but because the book is the last thing your BF and his dad did together.  2)  Consider scanning it to the cloud for safekeeping in case BF spills a vat of marinara on it.

We're in the process of doing this in our own home.\n\nIf your SIL and her mother thought they were entitled to the recipes before, I wouldn't be surprised if SIL tries to snoop for them anytime she and the kids are over.\n\nIn general, I'm not a fan of gatekeeping family recipes. However, these precious memories/recipes are not a part of your SIL's family traditions.

If anything, wouldn\u2019t it make his dad happy that more people are enjoying their creations?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to do anything he doesn\u2019t want. And I can even see maybe keeping a few really special  ones secret. But at the end of the day I will just never understand why people are so weird about sharing recipes, even if the recipes belong to deceased loved ones\u2026 when people like them enough to want to eat them often lol. That to me would be the ultimate compliment. I love cooking as well, but idk\u2026. I feel like part of the whole point is making people love food.

You gave the aggravators an opportunity to stop their behaviour by telling them _if_ they were going to be disrespectful they would have to leave, AND provided them some explanation for his reaction.

Good on you for sticking up for your boyfriend.", "NTA, if those recipes are so good that entire families starve when they can\u2019t have it.\n\nY\u2019all need to open a restaurant immediately.", "NTA. I have a recipe from my (dead) dad that belongs to our family. I don't like it myself, but I'll make it for my husband because he does. I'm also not likely to share that recipe with his siblings, but I'd be willing to make it for them if they asked. Sentimental things don't have to be \"things\" but can be a recipe or a place that is special, and you can't force someone to share something sentimental. \"No\" is a complete sentence and your family pushed too far by calling him selfish for trying to preserve something meaningful.\n\nMaybe in a few years he would have been receptive to the idea, but it's still fresh in his mind and the significance of the recipes might feel even more so now that his dad is gone, and your family's reaction might make him shut it down even more now. You stood up for your partner, well done you. Tell your family that they need to step back and realise how important this is to a grieving young man.", "NTA Come on, this can't be the only meal her kids will eat. How did they make it to 3 and 5 without starving?", "NTA, those recipes are very special to your boyfriend. Obviously no one is entitled to thise recipes but him and his dad. And your SIL is seeming to be using her kids to manipulate you.", "Nta. I understand kids are picky but she has so many other optio s than to harrass yall. She xould buy the food ingrediants and have him prepare large freezable portions to feed the kids. But trying to force your bf to hand over family recipes that hild sentimental value and that she has no right to is fed up", "NTA. Healthy little kids will not starve themselves to death, and if your SIL said that she is a major-league AH. And she gets it from her mom, who joined in the harassment of your BF.\n\nI have news for all involved: there are millions of recipes in the world. If SIL had a brain instead of a mean mouth, she'd know all she has to do is ask Google for recipes for the ingredients she has in mind. Then get literally dozens of recipes! BF didn't make some elaborate dish with 35 ingredients---if he was cooking for kids, he prolly used no more than five. \n\nOP, I know you're not going to quote me at SIL, although she does need to get over herself. But really, if she can remember two or three of the things in the kids' meal, she's well on the way to what she wants.\n\nAND kids at 3 and 5 have NO idea what they were eating. They had a good time and it was special---THAT they remember. If BF gave up his recipes and SIL made them, the kids would probably spit them out. They're kids, remember?\n\nIMHO, SIL and her mom owe BF an apology, and they should both pay more attention to how children really behave.\n\nBF wasn't an AH. Perhaps he should do some thinking about how to handle future requests for recipes. If they're that great the question will arise again. I'll bet many of the recipes are standard, with a special glow because if his personal history.", "NTA You were protecting a loved one at a vulnerable time. SIL just won't take no for an answer, and clearly her mother is the one who taught her not to. \n\nI cannot believe your SIL is using the children against you like this. They're refusing to eat their food? What's she going to do if you cave and give her the recipes---cook those foods whenever they demand it? \n\nIgnore her manipulative antics and enjoy your BF. Your love story is adorable, and his relationship with his dad is delightful. Thanks for sharing it!", "NTA!!! also that recipe book idea to use Polaroid photos, gosh that\u2019s so charming!!!", "NTA. I feel for those kids. They\u2019re hungry because your SIL didn\u2019t feed them. smh", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is being absolutely ridiculous. Also shame on her for trying to use her kids as a way to manipulate. Next time, tell your brother that your SIL is not invited.", "Absolutely NTA but I hope he passes them to OP, or someone else who can appreciate them, in his will. It would be unfortunate to lose them IMO", "ESH\nYour SIL is way to pushy but just share the recipes. What\u2019s wrong with people thinking recipes are a big secret?\n\nThey like dad\u2018s recipes so much they want to cook them. It\u2019s a good thing.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou did good protecting your bf.", "NTA. Why cant some people take no for an answer?! Im sure your SIL kids arent starving and she is just being dramatic. Kids will eat when they are hungry. Ignore it.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL and her mom are the overdramatic ones. If the kids go hungry, your brother and his wife aren't doing their job as parents.", "NTA. But if she\u2019s that bad a cook because she doesn\u2019t season anything, couldn\u2019t you just copy/paste a bunch of sensory safe recipes from any website into an email, and claim those are the recipes, and she\u2019d never know? Might help the kids.", "NTA.", "NTA. Also, is SIL going to cook the anyways?", "Order some Tony Chachere\u2019s Seasoning and start sprinkling.", "Nta dont know where you are in the uk but where i am 85% use spices and other flavours in cooking.", "NTA jeez give the man some time. I would bet if you gave your bf some time he\u2019d give out some recipes, but it\u2019s still so soon", "ESH wtf kind of family is this where you have one side refusing to share recipes (they don\u2019t lose value when you share them wtf is wrong with you) and the other side getting over dramatic saying they\u2019ll \u201cstarve\u201d without them. Everyone sucks here. No one acted like an adult here.", "I did something similar with my grandma before she died.we went through all of her recipes and put together a book of all of the things she has made for our family over the years. After she passed, I printed the book out and sent it to all my family members. It was a way of sending a part of my grandma into the world so she would be remembered and talked about. I put in there stories about her life as well, since she had lived 109 years and  had seen so much happen over that time. \n\nThat being said, the bf is not there yet, and may never be.  He is still grieving. So if he doesn't want to share, that is his choice.\n\nThe biggest problem is the SIL who not only wouldn't accept his refusal, but made it so much worse with her bs story about her kids starving without the recipes. This is the most ridiculous attempt at guilt and manipulation I have seen in a while.", "I have several secret recipes that I refuse to share. \n\nWhy? Because I did a massive amount of research and I put a massive amount of trial and error into perfecting them across several years. \n\nI consider the recipes my intellectual property. \n\nSo why would I go ahead and give that up to somebody who didn't do the work? Who didn't put in the time? \n\nIf they want to make x recipe that tastes identical to mine, they can figure it out how to do that themselves.", "> I dont really get why people get possessive about recipes, but each to their own.\n\nBecause they are intellectual property.", ">\tNTA, and here\u2019s how you handle people asking for your recipes. Act like you don\u2019t use a recipe and it\u2019s all in your head, and verbally give them the most vague recipe you can. People will stop asking, trust me.\n\nWhy? What\u2019s the downside? I cook a lot and if people ask me for a recipe I\u2018m delighted. They like my food, that\u2019s great!\n\nYou do understand that you can still use a recipe after you shared it?\n\nESH", ">\tThere are many reasons why people might not want to share recipes, and they are all valid\n\nI can\u2019t imagine one?", "\\*boyfriend/husband", "thank you for the sentiment, but i think you misread my post, my bf isn't dying anytime soon lol.", "They're sentimental to him and his dad only recently died. How does he suck for holding tight to a memory and wanting it to be something special between them? He owes his girlfriend's SIL nothing.", "literally out of anyone in this situation, the bf is the least AH.  \n1.) there are many reasons why someone might not want to hand our personal or family recipes. this could be sentimental, cultural, another commenter called them \"edible heirlooms\" where the recipe is sacred and kept secret but the food is made to share.  \n2.) regardless of all that. OP's boyfriend's recipes where a highly sentimental gift from his father, who made them because he knew he was gonna pass, where each recipe has a photo and a hand written note, where each dish will have a memory attached to it, who passed only a MONTH ago. this grief is still fresh, maybe in a year he will be more than willing to share the recipes, but hes still grieving, even op said hes only just started talking about his feeling concerning the death.  \nthis is your bio:\n\n>My name is Austin and I live in Frisco Colorado, the best city on earth. I\u2019m here for my own amusement. Sometimes the things I say are funny, sometimes they aren\u2019t.\n\nthis is clearly one of the times where you're not funny", "This is totally my dad when he taught me how to cook. Recipes don't exist in our house but I memorised my favourites quickly.", "This extra bit of important info makes you even more NTA! Your SIL makes no effort to help her children and then guilt-trips YOU to do something about it? No. Also, does she know that even if she did have your bf's receipe book, she would have to actually make the food? That's the bit she doesn't do now!", "I know. He should have another 50+ years to live but it\u2019s never too early to plan. Accidents and illness happen suddenly. My dad lasted a week once he got sick. He immediately went to the ICU and was very weak an medicated so it wasn\u2019t easy to talk. I regret not having him write down his recipes in advance. Now they are lost", "this was one of the only comments that have actually made me upset, but thank you for making me laugh at it", "Another possibility: the kids see these recipes as a big deal because their parents made a big deal out of them, so the hunger strike is a direct result of their parents not respecting the bf.", "Well said!", "Exactly. We have an old family recipe for Christmas ham that I've made every year since my mum passed away. Last Christmas I made photo books of all her handwritten recipes from the book she gave to me before she passed along with transferring the ham recipe (in her handwriting) onto chopping boards for the family. But I don't hand her recipes out willy nilly because the book was a gift for me from her to share with her grandkids. I'm estranged from one of my brothers (with good reason) but I made a copy of the book and a chopping board with the ham recipe for his 3 youngest children (his oldest child was with us for our family Christmas and got his there). Never got a thank you or even an acknowledgement of the gift, which could easily be given through my father or my oldest nephew.", "Share it and more woman can make it for their families. Maybe even men! This is completely ridiculous.", "Dill...BEANS?? I'm equally intrigued and horrified at the thought of dill beans", "So?", "Dilly beans are pickled green beans. I found out about them last year", "So, for whatever reason, my brain was thinking of like pickled pinto beans, bot green beans. Pickled green beans makes a LOT more sense, and actually sound good \ud83e\udd23", "There is no requirement that information be \u201ca vital part of the company\u2019s business\u201d in order to be a trade secret. The information just has to have commercial value by virtue of being secret, and the owner has to take reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy. That could even apply to granny\u2019s stuffing recipe under certain (admittedly uncommon) circumstances.", "That sounds interesting, like how would you pickle pinto beans? Hmmm\n\nI'm excited to try my partner's dilly beans at some point. We got it from his best friend's dad the last time we visited.", "It\u2019s been awhile since I learned about trade secrets. Thanks for filling in the gaps!"]}
