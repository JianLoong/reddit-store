It's not about being precious, these are recipes only he and his dad know! . That's a special bond he gets to hold onto even after losing him, and once he shares them with others it would be broken.\n\nShe's clearly massively entitled and has no empathy, don't let her make you question yourself.", "NTA, and here\u2019s how you handle people asking for your recipes. Act like you don\u2019t use a recipe and it\u2019s all in your head, and verbally give them the most vague recipe you can. People will stop asking, trust me.\n\n\u201cOh you like these muffins? Thanks, I just like to try stuff out. Yeah, so you use 2 cups-ish of flour, and then some kind of leavening agent like baking soda or whatever, but not too much, just like a teaspoon or two. Some people like to add salt but I find it works fine without but that\u2019s probably because I have salt in my butter. OH YEAH so you melt the butter, like a stick\u2019s worth, like cut a square about this big and melt it, and then you can add milk or yogurt or whatever you have that\u2019s milkish. I\u2019ve never tried soy milk but it probably works too. I like to add the sugar into the liquids first, but not too much. An egg. Anyway, stir it all together with the dry until it looks right.

How ridiculous, entitled and disrespectful of your SIL.", "NTA - normally not sharing recipes does seem a bit antisocial but in this context everyone should respect why the recipes are important to your bf and be understanding about his way of grieving.\n\nMore importantly your SIL behaved extremely childishly. She was uncooperative and rude about something which doesn\u2019t affect her life in the grand scheme of things, she didn\u2019t try to resolve anything even when your bf gave a kind compromise.

The only way for me to do that was by writing everything down, making adjustments, and trying again. I now have some recipes with more than 20 iterations. A **lot** of work has gone into them.\n\nWhen I serve these dishes to others, it's very common for them to ask me for the recipe. I find the request a little off-putting, because it doesn't respect the considerable effort I've put in to make the dishes come out just right. So, in some cases I'll politely decline. \n\nBut in other cases, I will, in fact, share the recipe... and you know what happens? Invariably, the person complains that they can't make it come out the same way. If I try to help them diagnose the problem, it's always because they've substituted something they shouldn't have, skipped a step they figured was unnecessary, used the wrong equipment, or simply lack the kitchen skills to properly follow the instructions.\n\nMy conclusion is that fielding requests for cherished recipes is a lose-lose proposition. If you decline, the person making the request sees you as unreasonable. If you accede, they'll just screw it up anyway.", "NTA. The recipe book is a lovely heirloom and I'm happy that husband has it.

Your SIL kids will eat when they are hungry. Your SIL should stop flapping her lips and get off her high horse. SIL really needs to grow up. MIL also needs to stay out of it. \nI feel for your BF. I have a box of old recipes that were my mothers. Some very generic and others that mean a lot to me because we came up with them together. Or tweaked some to our liking. No one knows which ones those are 100% but there are clues. Two different styles or writing is the easiest way to tell. I\u2019ve been asked for recipes and have given the generic c old school ones. Not the ones we have done. I want to keep those to myself because it was my mom. My youngest daughter knows everything and is the only one of the three daughters that have that shows any interest in learning these from ME. not just take them and try but to make them with me.

I was more than a little offended when some friend of the family that had never met the second bride wanted a copy of the book.  \n\nFrom your description, the recipe book may be handwritten by your BF's dad.  That makes the recipe book even more meaningful.  If he ever has children, the book will be an heirloom.  \n\nYour sister's children will eat when they get hungry enough.  Tell your sister to google a recipe.  There are gazillions of recipes on the net.  You can always tell her that you are not their parent, and neither is BF.  If the kids are really, truly, starving it is all on SIL and BIL as they are the custodial parents.  If you are really in a snarky mood, you can offer to notify CPS and their pediatrician.  \n\nTwo tiny suggestions, though...  1)  Make sure that SIL and MIL do not have access to the recipe book.  It's not about the recipes per see, but because the book is the last thing your BF and his dad did together.  2)  Consider scanning it to the cloud for safekeeping in case BF spills a vat of marinara on it.

We're in the process of doing this in our own home.\n\nIf your SIL and her mother thought they were entitled to the recipes before, I wouldn't be surprised if SIL tries to snoop for them anytime she and the kids are over.\n\nIn general, I'm not a fan of gatekeeping family recipes. However, these precious memories/recipes are not a part of your SIL's family traditions. She is in no way entitled to them any more than her mother, children, etc. are. \n\nActually, your SIL and her mother are pretty cruel to demand family recipes from your grieving SO.

If anything, wouldn\u2019t it make his dad happy that more people are enjoying their creations?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to do anything he doesn\u2019t want. And I can even see maybe keeping a few really special  ones secret. But at the end of the day I will just never understand why people are so weird about sharing recipes, even if the recipes belong to deceased loved ones\u2026 when people like them enough to want to eat them often lol. That to me would be the ultimate compliment. I love cooking as well, but idk\u2026. I feel like part of the whole point is making people love food.

They are expression's of who I am, my family, and so on -- and devaluing that as \"oh, it's just a recipe\" is crap. They absolutely lose that connection when freely shared.\n\nI do pass them on, but I'm very selective about who gets them. And I respect anyone that feels the same about *their* recipes.", "NTA: It\u2019s not JUST about the recipe. This young man lost his father. These recipes were created and developed over time and in loving moments with his dad. They come with memories, laughs, tears, and everything in between. To give that away (so soon after dad passed) would be like giving away those memories! He\u2019s not ready to do that! Each recipe comes with a story and part of  that Story is missing\u2026his dad! In time, he\u2019ll come to realize that his dad\u2019s legacy will live on with the passing of the recipes to others, but for now those memories and stories are too precious to part with. Give him time. He\u2019ll get there.", "That's the great thing about artistic endeavors. A person can share, or enjoy them In many ways. Not saying one way is right to all. But a s a person that has created many recipes, some have personal meaning, some are for sharing. One such recipe I won't give out to anyone was made with the help of a friend that passed before we got to cook it together. \n  A momento has many forms. To me food and music are memory triggers, where photos and letters don't hold as much meaning to me.", "Sorry I should have spoken to the original also and not just the comment. I totally agree with what you've said and in this context it makes complete sense. And how sil responded after, I'd say never give it to her."]}
