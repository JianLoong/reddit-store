It's not about being precious, these are recipes only he and his dad know! . That's a special bond he gets to hold onto even after losing him, and once he shares them with others it would be broken.\n\nShe's clearly massively entitled and has no empathy, don't let her make you question yourself.", "NTA, and here\u2019s how you handle people asking for your recipes. Act like you don\u2019t use a recipe and it\u2019s all in your head, and verbally give them the most vague recipe you can. People will stop asking, trust me.\n\n\u201cOh you like these muffins? Thanks, I just like to try stuff out. Yeah, so you use 2 cups-ish of flour, and then some kind of leavening agent like baking soda or whatever, but not too much, just like a teaspoon or two. Some people like to add salt but I find it works fine without but that\u2019s probably because I have salt in my butter. OH YEAH so you melt the butter, like a stick\u2019s worth, like cut a square about this big and melt it, and then you can add milk or yogurt or whatever you have that\u2019s milkish. I\u2019ve never tried soy milk but it probably works too. I like to add the sugar into the liquids first, but not too much. An egg. Anyway, stir it all together with the dry until it looks right.

How ridiculous, entitled and disrespectful of your SIL.", "NTA - normally not sharing recipes does seem a bit antisocial but in this context everyone should respect why the recipes are important to your bf and be understanding about his way of grieving.\n\nMore importantly your SIL behaved extremely childishly. She was uncooperative and rude about something which doesn\u2019t affect her life in the grand scheme of things, she didn\u2019t try to resolve anything even when your bf gave a kind compromise.

The only way for me to do that was by writing everything down, making adjustments, and trying again. I now have some recipes with more than 20 iterations. A **lot** of work has gone into them.\n\nWhen I serve these dishes to others, it's very common for them to ask me for the recipe. I find the request a little off-putting, because it doesn't respect the considerable effort I've put in to make the dishes come out just right. So, in some cases I'll politely decline. \n\nBut in other cases, I will, in fact, share the recipe... and you know what happens? Invariably, the person complains that they can't make it come out the same way. If I try to help them diagnose the problem, it's always because they've substituted something they shouldn't have, skipped a step they figured was unnecessary, used the wrong equipment, or simply lack the kitchen skills to properly follow the instructions.\n\nMy conclusion is that fielding requests for cherished recipes is a lose-lose proposition. If you decline, the person making the request sees you as unreasonable. If you accede, they'll just screw it up anyway.", "NTA. The recipe book is a lovely heirloom and I'm happy that husband has it.

Your SIL kids will eat when they are hungry. Your SIL should stop flapping her lips and get off her high horse. SIL really needs to grow up. MIL also needs to stay out of it. \nI feel for your BF. I have a box of old recipes that were my mothers. Some very generic and others that mean a lot to me because we came up with them together. Or tweaked some to our liking. No one knows which ones those are 100% but there are clues. Two different styles or writing is the easiest way to tell. I\u2019ve been asked for recipes and have given the generic c old school ones. Not the ones we have done. I want to keep those to myself because it was my mom. My youngest daughter knows everything and is the only one of the three daughters that have that shows any interest in learning these from ME. not just take them and try but to make them with me.

I was more than a little offended when some friend of the family that had never met the second bride wanted a copy of the book.  \n\nFrom your description, the recipe book may be handwritten by your BF's dad.  That makes the recipe book even more meaningful.  If he ever has children, the book will be an heirloom.  \n\nYour sister's children will eat when they get hungry enough.  Tell your sister to google a recipe.  There are gazillions of recipes on the net.  You can always tell her that you are not their parent, and neither is BF.  If the kids are really, truly, starving it is all on SIL and BIL as they are the custodial parents.  If you are really in a snarky mood, you can offer to notify CPS and their pediatrician.  \n\nTwo tiny suggestions, though...  1)  Make sure that SIL and MIL do not have access to the recipe book.  It's not about the recipes per see, but because the book is the last thing your BF and his dad did together.  2)  Consider scanning it to the cloud for safekeeping in case BF spills a vat of marinara on it.

We're in the process of doing this in our own home.\n\nIf your SIL and her mother thought they were entitled to the recipes before, I wouldn't be surprised if SIL tries to snoop for them anytime she and the kids are over.\n\nIn general, I'm not a fan of gatekeeping family recipes. However, these precious memories/recipes are not a part of your SIL's family traditions. She is in no way entitled to them any more than her mother, children, etc. are. \n\nActually, your SIL and her mother are pretty cruel to demand family recipes from your grieving SO.

If anything, wouldn\u2019t it make his dad happy that more people are enjoying their creations?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to do anything he doesn\u2019t want. And I can even see maybe keeping a few really special  ones secret. But at the end of the day I will just never understand why people are so weird about sharing recipes, even if the recipes belong to deceased loved ones\u2026 when people like them enough to want to eat them often lol. That to me would be the ultimate compliment. I love cooking as well, but idk\u2026. I feel like part of the whole point is making people love food.

Perhaps later in his life, he may want to make copies for special people in his life (never the idiot SIL hopefully) but only when it\u2019s his choice!  OP NTA, but sil sucks idiot balls!!", "OMG, you are not anything but a fine supportive and understanding wife. Your brother's wife just wants something and when she was told no she reacted like a six year old. You know her kids aren't going hungry. Your husband should keep his book in a very secure place. His recipe book with the special notes is a treasure. Tell him to get one of those fire boxes that lock to keep it in. I don't trust your sister-in-law. I've seen too many stories where a family member pitches a fit that they want something and when they don't get it, they scream that the owner is mean, selfish, etc. etc. and some of them just sneak around and take it. Don't let that happen to his recipes.", "NTA. They will eat when they're hungry.", "> However i got some messages from my SIL saying how her kids won't eat their food anymore and only want to eat the recipes and how I'm being cruel and starving two young children.\n\nMe: If your children, who are 3 and 5 years old, would rather starve than eat your food, then the problem is your cooking skills my dear SIL. Trust me when I say that my bf's recipes won't be enough to solve the problem. But I wish you a quick discovery of a definite solution. Best regards.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA, be proud of yourself. If I were your bf, I'd be over the moon for you standing up for me this way.", "NTA.  I guarantee the SIL's kids will eat when they get hungry.", "You protected your grieving partner. NTA at all.", "Kids that won't eat their food are not starving\n\nYou're NTA (and I applaud you for standing up to your family for your bf) and neither is your bf. SIL and MIL are definitely A. H.", "That's bs. If the kids even did that, their parents need to correct their behavior and continue to feed them. If you can't tell 3 and 5 year old kids no, it's time to start. \n\nNTA but your SIL is for suggesting you are starving her kids not giving her a recipe.", "NTA - I'd tell sil if she is starving the kids then it's in the children's best interests to involve child protection.", "Nope. NTA.", "NTA.   Good for you for stepping in and supporting bf.  The idea of the recipe book is heartfelt and a keepsake of his dad bf can treasure.\n\nSIL  is out to lunch.  Her kids will  eat again, don't worry.   She's  not worth it. \n\nPS  don't share the recipes.   He was generous to offer to make food when they visit", "NTA\n\nNo way their kids are really refusing to eat anything except these specific recipes it\u2019s just a pathetic attempt at a guilt trip.", "NTA sister in law and her mother are TA", "NTA but make sure that recipe book is safe or else she might steal it and sabotage it to spite your BF.", "Sil is the ah. She's also a drama queen who apparently can't cook. More people need to tell her no she can stop being so entitled.", "The kids ate one dish and one dessert. I am pretty sure they can't taste the other re ipies just by thinking about them. She can buy a recipie book if she wants to learn to cook better!\n\nYour hubs lost his dad just one month ago. It will be a whe before he is ready to share the items special to \"them\". \n\nNta. You were defending your grieving husband, like a good wife would!", "Plus starving is consistently going with too few calories to maintain good health. Kids that have food in front of them will only hunger strike for so long. Going to bed with an empty stomach is NOT starving.", "If her kids are on a hunger strike because they don't like her cooking, I don't know man, but I don't think someone's recipes are the issue here, or how being an asshole to OP is a good use of her time.", "My late brother-in-law was a successful owner of at least two separate Italian restaurants. His recipes are sacred to the family. There is only one person in his mother or father's side of the family that know the recipe for his pizza dough. We can consider it a gift from God when he prepares it for us but we would never dream of pressuring him for the recipe. That recipe is a bond with his grandfather. If he chooses to share it with anyone that is his choice but none of us would ever dream of asking for it. We would only dream that we get to taste it again before we die.", "NTA. I agree, I\u2019ve never seen the point of bogarting recipes but if the bf wants to do that it\u2019s his choice. And the SIL is being completely ridiculous.", "I dont think you are taking this seriously enough.\n\nWhat if the SIL spreads the knowledge of these starvation-inducing recipes to the whole world? That recipe book is like a doomsday device! Omg!\n\n/s", "It took me a sec to stop giggling.  That is exactly how I was given 3 recipes from my grandmothers and one from ex's.  And, they were totally serious, not doing the passive-aggressive thing at all.  That was how they cooked.", "That is how my mother and aunt passed on many recipes.", "That is just a standard grandmother recipe because they learned to cook by cooking with their mother. I don\u2019t think my grandmother owned a cookbook. She didn\u2019t even have slips with recipes written down. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nHer recipe amounts included using the glasses from jelly or other condiments and who knows what size those were. \n\nI wish I had her recipe for butter cookies as I can still see the shapes . She hid the cookies  in an old tin from Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation under the stairs because she knew I knew where to find it.", "Why are you calling me out? And no, I don't give out recipes in this format to be mean or anything. It's just the way I cook. I eyeball my ingredients and try a lot of stuff to see if I will like. If I like, I eat it. If I don't like, I don't eat it. I don't think I have ever cooked the same meal in the same manner with the exact same ingredients in my life, and I'm 37. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Genuine question - why? What's wrong with sharing recipes? If I made someone my grandma's kale soup and they liked it enough to ask for the recipe I'd be thrilled. These must be pretty unique recipes or something", "Maybe the grieving BF just want to share the special project he shared with his very recently deceased father.", "If they come out wrong, it's because they didn't \"make them with love\".", "The kids want McDonalds\u2026", "Recipes are a form of art to some. Some are shared some are personal. You don't expect a painter to just give up a piece because people want it, if it holds a personal meaning."]}
