Half an hour later, I see wet cups on the water table so I take them back to the kitchen to dry them thoroughly. My boss really lost her temper, said she\u2019d already dried them; I told her I could still see water on them and I didn\u2019t feel good about the whole thing.

Clean means clean, all foreign matter removed, including possibly infected guest slobber. \n\nBut your seeing the damp spots and completing the drying process was not out of line. Just on the attractive appearance level, your removing the drops of water wasn't out of line.", "ESH should\u2019ve said they had to be properly washed with soap and hot water, not that the drying part mattered", "Somthe business can afford to feed 600 people but cant afford extra solo cups? Something sounds fishy", "I\u2019ve always taken Covid pretty seriously and it\u2019s made me realize that because people with autoimmune diseases or otherwise compromised immune systems exist, I have to take any virus seriously. Flu and RSV have been pretty rampant here. My boss isn\u2019t anti-vax or anything, but she definitely doesn\u2019t take it as seriously.", "I hadn\u2019t even considered that - and I worked 10 years in food service, I should have made the point that no, we can\u2019t simply rinse the cups, we would need to use soap and dish sanitizer.", "I know she didn\u2019t use soap because I had stashed the dish soap and sponges under the sink so they weren\u2019t laying around cluttering up the kitchen and we didn\u2019t bring the soap and sponges back out til after the party to wash the serving trays and whatnot. What I think makes this even worse is that she was laying the plastic cups on the drying rack and anyone needing to use the restroom would have to walk by the drying rack and could see that we were reusing cups. This was supposed to be a nice, classy event and I thought at the very least it seemed tacky and cheap.", "I felt like at least half the people at the party wouldn\u2019t have appreciated using someone else\u2019s rinsed cup, without even knowing. Whole thing felt pretty sneaky and shady.", "No dish soap was used and I can\u2019t even be sure she used hot water.", "Honestly my boss is terrible with money. I have a pretty good idea how much money she makes, and how much the company makes - I have no idea where all the money goes but last month she was trying to get me to decide on a brand new computer that I don\u2019t need, and now she\u2019s not willing to pay $10 for more plastic cups.", "She\u2019s honestly the type of person who always has to have things go her way. If she tells me to do something, I have to do it exactly the way she wants. She\u2019s constantly reminding me who\u2019s in charge (by saying, \u201cI\u2019m the boss. I\u2019m in charge.\u201d Etc) In the end I think we only reused about a dozen cups before she relented, but I know that\u2019s still enough for an outbreak. I seriously doubt even a visit from the health department would be enough for her to admit she was wrong.", "Plus theirs gotta be some type of health and safety protocols she\u2019s breaking, especially if this happened at the work place. Lmao", "I think what bothered me even more was that people were gonna be using other peoples\u2019 cups without their knowledge or consent. It would have been totally different if these were nicer, reusable plastic cups (not the disposable cups they were) and we were washing, sanitizing, and drying them (our office doesn\u2019t have a dishwasher). I feel like when people come to these events they subconsciously expect at least minimum sanitary precautions taken. Surely everyone washed their hands before preparing, handling, serving the food, etc.", "That\u2019s fair - the entire drama part of it could have been avoided if I\u2019d just left the wet cups on the table. Then if someone wanted to bitch at us for re-using cups it would\u2019ve been all on her, lol. So I do appreciate your opinion!", "At first I felt like I could be the asshole for making the entire idea of simply rinsing cups such a big deal, but honestly now I\u2019m feeling like an asshole because my reason for wanting the cups to be completely dry was so guests wouldn\u2019t *know* we were re-using the cups. I\u2019ll admit that part of all this *does* make me an asshole. If people figured out we were reusing cups they could have taken that up with my boss and I would\u2019ve been in the clear.", "I actually do feel like an asshole for going along with re-using the cups, because I insisted they be completely dry so people *wouldn\u2019t know* we were re-using the cups. I didn\u2019t feel right about putting people\u2019s heath at risk without their knowledge or consent. \n\nBecause at the end of the day clean does mean all foreign matter removed but potentially infected guest slobber removed would be  *sanitized* and we had no way of sanitizing - I don\u2019t even know whether or not my boss was using hot water.", "All of the food was basically brought in like a potluck. Our office supplied the wine so she bought $9 magnum bottles from the liquor store - and this is a town known for their wine. She pinches pennies and cuts cost ever chance she gets.", "Yep 100%. It\u2019s super gross. Good on your for standing up to your boss", "What? Dude that pushes you even further into nta territory, how can you get a new computer but not a pack of cups lmao", "She might rethink that if sued. Next time cya.", "Exactly! It's somewhere no one would expect to have to worry about that level of contamination so there's no way they would expect that risk. Basically, you protected people from a risk they wouldn't anticipate from someone ethically and legally preparing their food and drink. And that may literally have saved someone's life and you should be proud of it."]}
