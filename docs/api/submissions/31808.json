Clean means clean, all foreign matter removed, including possibly infected guest slobber. \n\nBut your seeing the damp spots and completing the drying process was not out of line. Just on the attractive appearance level, your removing the drops of water wasn't out of line.", "ESH should\u2019ve said they had to be properly washed with soap and hot water, not that the drying part mattered", "Somthe business can afford to feed 600 people but cant afford extra solo cups? Something sounds fishy", "I\u2019ve always taken Covid pretty seriously and it\u2019s made me realize that because people with autoimmune diseases or otherwise compromised immune systems exist, I have to take any virus seriously. Flu and RSV have been pretty rampant here. My boss isn\u2019t anti-vax or anything, but she definitely doesn\u2019t take it as seriously.", "I hadn\u2019t even considered that - and I worked 10 years in food service, I should have made the point that no, we can\u2019t simply rinse the cups, we would need to use soap and dish sanitizer.", "I know she didn\u2019t use soap because I had stashed the dish soap and sponges under the sink so they weren\u2019t laying around cluttering up the kitchen and we didn\u2019t bring the soap and sponges back out til after the party to wash the serving trays and whatnot. What I think makes this even worse is that she was laying the plastic cups on the drying rack and anyone needing to use the restroom would have to walk by the drying rack and could see that we were reusing cups. This was supposed to be a nice, classy event and I thought at the very least it seemed tacky and cheap.", "I felt like at least half the people at the party wouldn\u2019t have appreciated using someone else\u2019s rinsed cup, without even knowing. Whole thing felt pretty sneaky and shady.", "No dish soap was used and I can\u2019t even be sure she used hot water.", "Honestly my boss is terrible with money. I have a pretty good idea how much money she makes, and how much the company makes - I have no idea where all the money goes but last month she was trying to get me to decide on a brand new computer that I don\u2019t need, and now she\u2019s not willing to pay $10 for more plastic cups.", "She\u2019s honestly the type of person who always has to have things go her way. If she tells me to do something, I have to do it exactly the way she wants. She\u2019s constantly reminding me who\u2019s in charge (by saying, \u201cI\u2019m the boss. I\u2019m in charge.\u201d Etc) In the end I think we only reused about a dozen cups before she relented, but I know that\u2019s still enough for an outbreak. I seriously doubt even a visit from the health department would be enough for her to admit she was wrong.", "Plus theirs gotta be some type of health and safety protocols she\u2019s breaking, especially if this happened at the work place. Lmao", "I think what bothered me even more was that people were gonna be using other peoples\u2019 cups without their knowledge or consent. It would have been totally different if these were nicer, reusable plastic cups (not the disposable cups they were) and we were washing, sanitizing, and drying them (our office doesn\u2019t have a dishwasher). I feel like when people come to these events they subconsciously expect at least minimum sanitary precautions taken. Surely everyone washed their hands before preparing, handling, serving the food, etc.", "That\u2019s fair - the entire drama part of it could have been avoided if I\u2019d just left the wet cups on the table. Then if someone wanted to bitch at us for re-using cups it would\u2019ve been all on her, lol. So I do appreciate your opinion!", "At first I felt like I could be the asshole for making the entire idea of simply rinsing cups such a big deal, but honestly now I\u2019m feeling like an asshole because my reason for wanting the cups to be completely dry was so guests wouldn\u2019t *know* we were re-using the cups. I\u2019ll admit *that* part of all this *does* make me an asshole. If people figured out we were reusing cups they could have taken that up with my boss and I would\u2019ve been in the clear.", "I actually do feel like an asshole for going along with re-using the cups, because I insisted they be completely dry so people *wouldn\u2019t know* we were re-using the cups. I didn\u2019t feel right about putting people\u2019s heath at risk without their knowledge or consent. \n\nBecause at the end of the day clean does mean all foreign matter removed but potentially infected guest slobber removed would be  *sanitized* and we had no way of sanitizing - I don\u2019t even know whether or not my boss was using hot water.", "All of the food was basically brought in like a potluck. Our office supplied the wine so she bought $9 magnum bottles from the liquor store - and this is a town known for their wine. She pinches pennies and cuts cost ever chance she gets.", "Yep 100%. It\u2019s super gross. Good on your for standing up to your boss", "What? Dude that pushes you even further into nta territory, how can you get a new computer but not a pack of cups lmao", "She might rethink that if sued. Next time cya.", "Exactly! It's somewhere no one would expect to have to worry about that level of contamination so there's no way they would expect that risk. Basically, you protected people from a risk they wouldn't anticipate from someone ethically and legally preparing their food and drink. And that may literally have saved someone's life and you should be proud of it.", "You boss engaged in an unsanitary practice that could make people sick if they drank from the cup of someone who was contagious.  Rinsing is entirely different from washing properly. With soap.  \n\nWhat your boss did was unhealthy and disgusting.  \n\nNTA", "I thought this was gonna be at a frat party! Horrifying that professional adults would do this.", "NTA, that\u2019s a great way to get Covid or Mono", "NTA, imagine one person with an active cold sore. Herpes is for life and rinsing a cup and someone else using it will pass along the virus to the next person. Not to mention everything else like RSV, the flu, covid or anything that you can possibly imagine is going around, plus digusting smokers who have used the cups.", "She was just rinsing them, not washing properly with soap? That is disgusting. Did she learn nothing during covid?", "Uh \u2026", "Yes you were a flaming ass hole", "This is why they invented sharpies. So you can write everyone's names on their cups and you use less as people don't get confused after they put their drink down about which one was theirs.\n\nI learned this at college keggers and after-hours parties.", "I'm confused... What did you hope to achieve by taking the cups back to dry them thoroughly? You (rightfully, I imagine) assessed people would be grossed out by the prospect of reusing someone else's cups, but wouldn't the cups being dry just assist with concealing that fact from them? \n\nI'd say tentative NTA for making a big deal about it for the myriad of health reasons, but I'm kind of \"??!\" over you seeming to draw the line at the cups still being wet rather than water temp/actual soap being used.", "Yta", "They didn't though. They brought it up once and then tried to do a more thorough job of covering up the potential health hazard. The only reason they got more cups was because OP's boss got her ego hurt that OP thought her work was not good enough \n\nOP YTA for not only allowing this to happen, but also trying to help your boss hide the fact that they were re-used. There are so many risks from sharing utensils, and at a 600-people party? That's insane", "Yeah I definitely understand that now - I\u2019m glad I decided to post this here, really wanted some outside opinions so your opinion\u2019s pretty important to me - seriously. Thanks!", "[deleted]", "Yeah this would absolutely work at a small party - our party was 600 people coming and going. I think the solution is to invest in sturdier, reusable cups that can be washed (with soap), sanitized, *then* set back out. That would be less wasteful and would pay for itself in the long run but my boss obviously hates spending money. We started the party with about 150 cups, knowing at least 500 people would be coming - in my opinion my boss needs to either stop being so cheap, or stop hosting events.", "This is a fair opinion and I actually agree with you that *I\u2019m* the asshole when it comes to hiding the fact that we were re-using the cups, by drying them more thoroughly. Honestly I was embarrassed that she was being that cheap, when I should\u2019ve been concerned that people would be drinking from used cups without knowing. There\u2019s no contradicting my boss and I\u2019m honestly trying to get out of this job, but if I had to do it over again I would have simply thrown away the wet cups behind her back \ud83d\ude06", "Then you should know how soap is not a decorative item and an important part of the cleaning process.....\n\nThem gross cups needed to go or be cleaned properly. Might need to point out that a few measly cups is cheaper than lost productivity from people being sick. It's a bit of a heartless way of putting it, but she doesn't seem particularly empathetic.", "> our office doesn\u2019t have a dishwasher\n\noO My mind boggles.... Office big enough for 600 person party, has less than 2 dishwashers. Smaller offices I've worked in have had 1, larger offices at least 2. \n\nAm in the UK though, which may make a difference.", "You\u2019re not the A-hole for questioning it; your boss is the A-hole for inviting 600 people and being too cheap to give each of them one friggin\u2019 cup. I understand that your job might have been on the line if you had refused to pass out the grotty cups; maybe it\u2019s time to look for a better workplace.", "Rinsing out plastic cups \u2026 for new people to use \u2026 600 people?

So congratulations on your successful germ party for 600 unsuspecting people.

Our office\u2019s kitchen is pretty small, we have a full fridge, a microwave, and a sink. Still, there\u2019s room for a dishwasher but my boss would never - she\u2019s so, so cheap. One of my coworkers finally brought in a new coffee maker, we had this nasty plastic coffee maker I\u2019m pretty sure my boss had owned for 20 years. Counting my boss there are only 6 of us but we work on commission and I\u2019ve seen the checks - I honestly don\u2019t know where all the money goes and I\u2019m getting exhausted of her penny pinching. I consider myself pretty frugal but geez, this lady \ud83d\ude06", "And you have to understand that there was a bit of panic on my end, I don\u2019t think any of my coworkers are on Reddit but I could take \u201cuhhh\u201d to mean someone recognizes this situation and knows I\u2019m putting my boss on blast.", "Running a business isn't a cheap endeavour, but if stuff really doesn't add up, someone may have to consider playing the fraud card. \n\nIf conditions are sufficiently bad, and she's making your lives suck over pointless penny pinching (some bosses do be like this) I'd consider if it's time to move on. I had a boss like that, and eventually chose to transfer to another part of the business (though he also massively sucked in other ways too). He wasn't fraudy though, just pointlessly penny pinching. Wouldn't let me launch AWS micro instances when we desperately needed them. Confirmed with IT that the micros were stupid cheap per year, but boss got it into his head we needed as few as possible, despite our AWS bill being one of the smallest in the company. I get saving where possible, but he was trying to get me to shove 2 or more things in a thing only really designed to take 1.", "Read my second post.

When I nearly left a year ago she arranged for everyone else in the office (except for her) to give me a tiny portion of their commission.
