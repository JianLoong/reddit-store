She had asked to live with me after my father's side of the family cut ties with her, and I had said yes because despite our differences, the pandemic had been tough on all of us and I couldn't turn her away.\n\nMy older brother (we will call him E) had asked me last minute to take care of my father while he looks for a house to live in with E. I was a bit peeved because it wasn't in my schedule to look after someone else. I work a lot during the day ( I am a nurse ), plus I have two children who are both in high school. Because of this, I asked my aunt if she could help out with my dad while I was at work before I said anything to E.\n\nMy aunt said she'd be happy to help since that's her cousin. I assured her she didn't have to and I could always just tell my brother no, but she insisted so I said yes. The first day my dad comes is on the weekend and everything goes fine. I didn't have work so I helped my father around with my aunt while my kids pitched in here and there too. The situation was going fine until I started going back to work.\n\nFor about three days, I had left home from work thinking my aunt was taking care of my father while I was away with the help of my kids when they got home from school. Well, when I had actually asked how my aunt was doing with my father ( I had asked this because my father seemed sleepier than usual ), my kids had looked at me confused and told me that she hadn't been taking care of him. They then let me know that she'd take them out of school earlier than usual just to drop them off to care for their grandpa.\n\nI was obviously furious. Not only would she lie to me over the phone when I checked up on her, but she was also taking *my* kids out of school to do what she insisted on doing. I of course confronted her and told her that her lying to me and taking my kids out of school to take care of their grandpa was way out of line and I told her that she could either take care of him like she said she would or he could go back to E.\n\nShe didn't say anything to me and when I woke up to find her the next morning, she had taken all her stuff and gone to my cousin's house. Now my family is blowing up my and my sibling's phones calling us selfish for not taking responsibility for our father despite us all being grown adults with full-time jobs and children.\n\nI understand taking care of someone is a hard task, and I don't think I should've threatened to send my father back, but I just had to get some insight. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : I had left out some info so some of you were confused, I apologize and will clear things up.\n\n1; E sent my father down to live with me because he couldn't constantly care for him. That being said, the only reason I had accepted was because I checked in with my household, aunt included, and asked if it was okay\n\n2; In my family, anyone who is older than you is considered an aunt or uncle . I apologize for not making this clear , I now realize it must be a cultural thing .\n\n3; My aunt was put on the emergency card when school started again in case of emergencies, that was why she was able to pull them out. On the topic , my children assumed I was the one telling my aunt to pull them out , that is why they never brought it up to me .\n\n4; Me saying I would move my dad out was not in logic and out of anger, which is why this post was created in the first place. I would never move that old man out , but I did blow it up when I told her I would if she couldn't handle it.\n\nI hope I cleared everything up. As silly as it is, I wanted to see an outsider's input to fix this issue. Despite her actions, she is still family.", "created_utc": 1671529857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqkej6/aita_for_making_my_aunt_move_out/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt is a huge AH but I don\u2019t understand how the threat of sending your dad back to your brother really works. TBH I would have sent her packing as soon as I found out what was happening with the kids.", "NTA. Your father needs responsible care. It\u2019s wrong to take teenagers out of school to care for him when your aunt, a supposedly responsible adult, was to be doing it. What was your aunt doing? \n\nYour reaction was mild, and reasonable. Since you couldn\u2019t work and your aunt couldn\u2019t be trusted, you had no other choice but send your father back to E. You simply asked your aunt if she could be trusted from then on. \n\nYour aunt chose to leave. I am baffled that you\u2019re the villain in this story. When I started reading, I thought the story was going to be much different.", "NTA. Your children shouldn't be taken out of school to care for an elderly person, much less be responsibility for taking care of an elderly person. Your aunt agreed to the task before he arrived but didn't fulfil her promise. Instead, she lied and ran the second you called her out. You can tell the rest of your family what happened and suggest housing her if they think you're being \"selfish\". Guaranteed they will back pedal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of being a liar and disrupting your kids education she could\u2019ve told you that she didn\u2019t want to help take care of your father.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are not good at setting boundaries or looking out for yourself, are you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are the family dumpster for all charity cases they do nat want to take care of themselves.", "NTA- you took in your Aunt when no one else in the family would and she left as soon as she was asked to pitch in\u2026 I assume your Aunt was physically and mentally able to help so she is the assh0le in this not you and your brother who are trying to figure out your Dad\u2019s care", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t *make* your aunt do anything, she left of her own accord - though you\u2019d have been well within your rights to throw her out for taking your kids out of school.  That\u2019s just absurdly unacceptable behavior, and that she did it to cover for her failure to keep her word just makes it worse.  Consider yourself well rid of her, and get together with E to work out your dad\u2019s care.", "[removed]", "Thank you for your input ! As for your question, my brother and father moved about 3 hours from where I lived, so he was the only one housing him , however , it was a choice my brother made in an attempt to reconcile with our father.  ( A detail I did leave out from the story that may be slightly insignificant is that my siblings and I did not have the best relationship with him as a whole growing up ). I did visit my brother when I could, and when I was around, I helped a lot since my father is very old !", "NTA, but given she lied repeatedly to you, and probably encouraged/forced your kids to lie, she is 100% lying to other people about what happened. I\u2019d set the story straight, but be prepared for her telling whoever she goes to next that you\u2019re conspiring against her. \n\nKinda wondering why her family had previously cut ties with her\u2026", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nLying to you about it was wrong", "NTA\n\nCHANGE THE LOCKS ASAP!!\n\nShe may come back.  And tell the kids not to leave school with her.  \n\nI'm proud of you for standing up for your kids.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS ANYWHERE", "NTA her behaviour was unacceptable. Also why do your family expect a full time nurse with 2 kids to also take care of two older family members it's a lot to put on one person with no help. Ungrateful AHs.", "How on earth is your aunt, seemingly your cousin once removed, able sign your kids out of school? I call BS.", "Okay NTA but things are completely confused. Who ended up moving with E? Aunt or Father? And why was E asking you to care for father in the first place? I couldn't descipher this from what the text said. But yeah, aunt lied and abused your trust, obviously not the AH.", "I'd be even more concerned about why the school let the aunt take the kids out of school.  Did the school have permission to do that?", "NTA she was staying for free. She insisted on helping your father. She lied to you and took your kids out of school (how though was she able to just take them? I would follow up with the school here).\nInstead of following through on her word when called out. She ran away like a child. Sounds like an unwanted house guest left on their own.", "You got really lucky that she removed herself from your place. If you had tried to kick her out you would have had to go through formal eviction. Don't let her back in. Better yet, change the locks. NTA", "So those relatives are basically announcing that they are all available to share caretaking of your dad and supporting your aunt, despite their having jobs, etc.  \nThank them for offering and that you are very happy your aunt now has a home she can live out her life in.", "Wow. ESH except your kids.", "NTA and it\u2019s a good thing she left. Taking kids out of school? Holy cow.", "[deleted]", "NTA - It's one thing if she agreed, tried and then found it difficult. But the fact that she didn't even try and interrupted your children's education and told you she would after you double checked is completely in the wrong. Definitely NTA.", "I'm really struggling to follow this.\n\nHow is your dad your aunt's cousin? Shouldn't she be his sister or your mother's sister? \n\nYou also threatened to kick your dad out for your aunt? Wtf? What did your dad do wrong?\n\nINFO: just what exactly is going on? She was confronted by you and left, and now your family are having a go at you? Have you told them what she did?\n\nThis is very, very confusing.", "And what was the plan? Was she going to take them out every day? OP would have gotten notification because the kids were missing so much class.(and that\u2019s if OP isn\u2019t one of those parents who checks the online portal all the time). \n\nThe whole thing seems really weird.", "You can list the people who can take your kids. \nWe have a close family friend who we call \u201cauntie\u201d who is on my kids school list as \u201cable to sign out\u201d. You fill it out every year with the student hand book and emergency contact forms.", "You are NTA. Your aunt is and no wonder a lot of people have cut her off. Perhaps it's time for professional help with your dad.", "NTA\nWhy the heck did she insist she could do something when she couldn't or wouldn't do it? Just say you cant do it in the first place??", "Thank you for asking ! E had asked me to care for my father because he had some difficult things going on with his work where he could not be home for most of the day . As for the moving , nobody had back moved in with E ! I believe I had made an error .", "My aunt was put on the emergency card when school started up again, so I am very sure that's why she was able to. My kids also assumed that I was telling my aunt to pull them out and decided to not ask about it", "English is not my proudest lanaguge to type , so I left out some details, But here is the info.\n\n1, In my family, anyone who is older than you and has a connection is considered an aunt or uncle.\n\n2, I had left this part out, but I didn't exactly threaten to kick him out. I only said I would send him back if nobody could care for him, because no one can\n\n3, This is not my aunt's first rodeo when It comes to rumors. The whole reason ties were cut between her and my family is because she spread rumors about her sister. My family that lives down here are also very protective over my father despite all situations because he is old so anything she must've told them will stick sadly.\n\nI hope that clear up some things, I want to do my best to fix the situation so I really want people to understand me", "It was only three days, which isn\u2019t that hard to go under the radar in high school", "Ok so i think you just need to set the record straight and leave it at that then.", "Exactly what this person said ! My aunt was put on the emergency card once they could go back into school", "Err, NTA, but hopefully you're realising that if an entire side of the family cuts ties with someone, there's probably a reason.", " NTA. Change your locks and take her off the school\u2019s emergency contact card. I would even go ahead and change your wifi password and think about getting a camera for places she could try to enter or vandalize. Don\u2019t deal with people that are willing to jeopardize the future of your children.", "And OP was checking in with her while she was working and the aunt just told her things were fine. It's not like she didn't have a chance to say she was overwhelmed and they needed to figure something else out, she straight up lied about how she was neglecting a person in need of care and taking literal children out of school to do it for her. \n\nCaretaking is a hard and relentless job, the aunt is not an asshole for not being able to do it long term. She \\*is\\* TA for just neglecting the poor man and lying about it to everyone instead of figuring out another solution like a responsible adult.", "This right here. Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself"]}
