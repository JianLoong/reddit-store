She had asked to live with me after my father's side of the family cut ties with her, and I had said yes because despite our differences, the pandemic had been tough on all of us and I couldn't turn her away.\n\nMy older brother (we will call him E) had asked me last minute to take care of my father while he looks for a house to live in with E. I was a bit peeved because it wasn't in my schedule to look after someone else. I work a lot during the day ( I am a nurse ), plus I have two children who are both in high school. Because of this, I asked my aunt if she could help out with my dad while I was at work before I said anything to E.\n\nMy aunt said she'd be happy to help since that's her cousin. I assured her she didn't have to and I could always just tell my brother no, but she insisted so I said yes. The first day my dad comes is on the weekend and everything goes fine. I didn't have work so I helped my father around with my aunt while my kids pitched in here and there too. The situation was going fine until I started going back to work.\n\nFor about three days, I had left home from work thinking my aunt was taking care of my father while I was away with the help of my kids when they got home from school. Well, when I had actually asked how my aunt was doing with my father ( I had asked this because my father seemed sleepier than usual ), my kids had looked at me confused and told me that she hadn't been taking care of him. They then let me know that she'd take them out of school earlier than usual just to drop them off to care for their grandpa.\n\nI was obviously furious. Not only would she lie to me over the phone when I checked up on her, but she was also taking *my* kids out of school to do what she insisted on doing. I of course confronted her and told her that her lying to me and taking my kids out of school to take care of their grandpa was way out of line and I told her that she could either take care of him like she said she would or he could go back to E.\n\nShe didn't say anything to me and when I woke up to find her the next morning, she had taken all her stuff and gone to my cousin's house. Now my family is blowing up my and my sibling's phones calling us selfish for not taking responsibility for our father despite us all being grown adults with full-time jobs and children.\n\nI understand taking care of someone is a hard task, and I don't think I should've threatened to send my father back, but I just had to get some insight.

At the end of the day you asked her before he came. And she's the one taking your children out of school to avoid her responsibilities. Your responsibilities are to your children, she's a grown adult who knew exactly what she's doing.", "NTA your aunt is the AH what she did was terrible", "NTA-She gave her word, then lied. Worse, she used your kids to when her energy could just have gone to doing what she claimed she\u2019d do.", "NTA. Your aunt shouldn't have said yes to helping with your dad when she had no intention to. \nI don't suppose these relatives blowing up your phones can offer any help or is it just their job to pass judgement after only hearing your aunt's side of the story?", "NTA  because you discussed it and expected there would be care for your father while you were working. Your aunt is a huge AH but I don\u2019t understand how the threat of sending your dad back to your brother really works. TBH I would have sent her packing as soon as I found out what was happening with the kids.", "NTA. Your father needs responsible care. It\u2019s wrong to take teenagers out of school to care for him when your aunt, a supposedly responsible adult, was to be doing it. What was your aunt doing? \n\nYour reaction was mild, and reasonable. Since you couldn\u2019t work and your aunt couldn\u2019t be trusted, you had no other choice but send your father back to E. You simply asked your aunt if she could be trusted from then on. \n\nYour aunt chose to leave. I am baffled that you\u2019re the villain in this story. When I started reading, I thought the story was going to be much different.", "NTA. Your children shouldn't be taken out of school to care for an elderly person, much less be responsibility for taking care of an elderly person. Your aunt agreed to the task before he arrived but didn't fulfil her promise. Instead, she lied and ran the second you called her out. You can tell the rest of your family what happened and suggest housing her if they think you're being \"selfish\". Guaranteed they will back pedal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As for your question, my brother and father moved about 3 hours from where I lived, so he was the only one housing him , however , it was a choice my brother made in an attempt to reconcile with our father.

I did visit my brother when I could, and when I was around, I helped a lot since my father is very old !", "NTA, but given she lied repeatedly to you, and probably encouraged/forced your kids to lie, she is 100% lying to other people about what happened.
