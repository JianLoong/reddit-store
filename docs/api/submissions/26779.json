She went to my ILs house to celebrate the baby over the weekend. My husband and I were there and so was my daughter (24f). My husband and I have been married for 22 years and together for 23 years. My stepdaughter lived primarily with us from the ages of 6 to 17. Her mom was still in the picture but moved around a lot.\n\nMy daughter brought a card and gift for my stepdaughter's baby. My stepdaughter opened up the card and loudly claimed my daughter needed to take it back because she wasn't Aunt Jade to her baby and she would not be bringing that into her house when she had signed it that way. My daughter was embarrassed and upset with the very quick rejection of the card and the title but she took the card back. I told my stepdaughter she could have handled that with far more tact and being rude to my daughter was not right.\n\nMy stepdaughter told me I had no right to accuse her of being rude. She said if the card from me and her dad could be from Grandpa and Rose, then my daughter should know her place and know she won't be an aunt or a family member to her child. She told me I had just called out a newly post partum mom and should be ashamed of myself and she said my daughter needed to realize her place.\n\nAITA for calling her out?", "created_utc": 1694609415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hm7if/aita_for_accusing_my_stepdaughter_of_being_rude/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For someone to react like that it feels like there is deep rooted conflict or resentment. It seems that she doesn't like you or your daughter.", "NTA - Anyone who tells another person they need to 'know their place' is a nasty piece of work. She's right that she can decide relationships for her child from family members but being a postpartum mother does not excuse her from basic manners and you have every right to tell her how rude she is. She sounds disgusting.", "NTA your step daughter has decided to be unnecessarily mean. Even if you think that, you smile and nod and bring it up in private if it\u2019s a big deal. Having a new born baby is tough but I feel like your step daughter is hiding behind being post partum as an excuse to be nasty. And honestly, the desire to \u201cput people in their place\u201d speaks volumes about a persons character.", "NTA - but your step daughter is wow, I mean, I hope that\u2019s just post birth hormones talking but yikes. She actually said \u201cknow your place\u201d? Wow.", "NTA\n\nYou were absolutely right, your stepdaughter was shockingly rude.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that she does not need to like your daughter, nor accept her as a sister or an aunt to her child. It's very sad that she feels that way after they have been stepsiblings since she was literally a toddler, but such is life, and she is allowed to make those choices for herself. BUT . . .\n\nYour daughter did nothing more than give her a loving gift for her child, and a card that expressed hope for a familial relationship. There was nothing wrong with that either. And there is *absolutely no world in which a grown-ass, 27-year-old woman needs to loudly humiliate someone who has done nothing more than be kind and loving to her*, even if she doesn't want that.  All she had to do was say thanks - no one was even going to know what the card said other than her - and at some point later quietly tell your daughter that she was uncomfortable with her calling herself \"Auntie\", that she'd rather they just stuck to first names.\n\nThis being Reddit, undoubtedly people will speculate and project in the comments, and insist that \"she probably had told her a thousand times before\" or other things that we do not and cannot know. None of this is relevant, because it's imaginary.\n\nYour stepdaughter was angry about a card her baby was never going to see, and her comment about \"she wouldn't bring it into her house like that\" doesn't even make sense. The baby is a 6-week-old infant who cannot be confused about titles. That degree of anger over something that was well-meaning is . . . worrisome. Your stepdaughter needs therapy. And you are NTA for pointing out that her behaviour was disgusting.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to be honest. People sometimes get exactly what they want and then for some unfathomable reason are shocked and bewildered that they did get exactly what they want. \n\nThere is going to come a time in the near future that your Stepdaughter will want a babysitter, maybe she'll want a break, maybe a night out, whatever and she may find none of her bio family are available to babysit and she WILL inevitably ask your Daughter to babysit.. I guarantee you.. it will happen and your Daughter should quite rightly put your Stepdaughters words back against her.. That she should know her place, that she isn't bio family and she won't be babysitting under any circumstances..", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. That was tactless of her. \n\nShe could have merely said thank you, and then later gotten your daughter alone and told her that while she appreciated the interest she would not be calling her her babies aunt. \n\nThere was no reason for her to be so blatantly and deliberately rude and cruel unless that was exactly what she was aiming for.", "NTA. If I wrote Aunty Feetflat on a card for my friend's newborn, even though we're not biologically related, she wouldn't call me out like that.

I can see, why you are not her \"mom\", given the age when you and hubby started dating and here living with her mom until she was 6. But there would have been room (potentially) to develop a sisterly relationship, given they were 4 and 1 and being a sibling is usually not exclusive to one person (whereas \"mom\" can be perceived).\n\nHave they been distant growing up and never referred to each others as sisters?\n\nI mean, don\u00b4t know. But sounds like this might have not happened out of the blue. Though even my friends would refer to my as \"Aunty Happy\\_Train\" with their children, so it\u00b4s a bit awkward to say \"you are not the aunt\" if the word is used widely for grown up acquaintances for children.

After I\u2019m aware, I\u2019d be whatever they want from me.

She went from two parents to divorced parents to mum going off for work and being left with dad and his new family.

She went to my ILs house to celebrate the baby over the weekend. My husband and I were there and so was my daughter (24f). My husband and I have been married for 22 years and together for 23 years. My stepdaughter lived primarily with us from the ages of 6 to 17. Her mom was still in the picture but moved around a lot.\n\nMy daughter brought a card and gift for my stepdaughter's baby. My stepdaughter opened up the card and loudly claimed my daughter needed to take it back because she wasn't Aunt Jade to her baby and she would not be bringing that into her house when she had signed it that way. My daughter was embarrassed and upset with the very quick rejection of the card and the title but she took the card back. I told my stepdaughter she could have handled that with far more tact and being rude to my daughter was not right.\n\nMy stepdaughter told me I had no right to accuse her of being rude. She said if the card from me and her dad could be from Grandpa and Rose, then my daughter should know her place and know she won't be an aunt or a family member to her child. She told me I had just called out a newly post partum mom and should be ashamed of myself and she said my daughter needed to realize her place.\n\nAITA for calling her out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The stepsister doesn't like them because she felt abandoned by her mom and didn't want to be in her father's house . . . and the only convenient people to resent were the ones who weren't directly related to her.

And there you were, with no blood attachments to her, doing what a mother is supposed to do. While hers is travelling around. I honestly think that by telling you and your daughter to \"know your place\", she's only trying very hard to remember the place she has to keep for her mother (and probably kept her entire youth) in case she comes back full time. \n\nI do think she was rude. And yes, probably hormones might have played in the way she reacted. But my heart honestly aches for her. Because there won't be a good outcome. If the grand-mother is as distant with her baby as she was with her, she will still feel like sh**.
