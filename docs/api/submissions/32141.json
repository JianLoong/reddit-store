We are considering getting married in the future.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom (57F) was laid off from her job this week. Her rent has been slowly increasing as well and she asked if she could move into our spare bedroom while she finds a new job and a new place to live. I didn\u2019t outright tell her no, but I also did not say yes either. Here is the rub \u2013 my mom suffers from anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. She has problems that make it difficult for otherwise healthy people to be around her, let alone live with her. Things need to be her way or she gets anxiety. She can be controlling and sometimes manipulative and doesn\u2019t care about anyone else except for me (I\u2019m an only child) and her mother. She has mentioned to me in the past that she will be sad on my wedding day.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason I don\u2019t want her staying in our spare bedroom is that 5 years ago she went through the same thing \u2013 didn\u2019t have a job, couldn\u2019t afford rent, didn\u2019t want to live with her mother so she came to stay with me until she got her bearings. For the next 3 years I financially and emotionally supported my mom. I was 25 then and my world shrunk because of her OCD. I suffered from depression but kept this a secret from her. She was and still is EXTREMELY attached to me. She\u2019s told me multiple times that wherever I go she will move to be close to me.\r  \n\r  \nThe only reason I moved out was to attend grad school across the country. When I graduated, I moved back but this time I moved in with my boyfriend instead of my mom. She\u2019s been talking about us living together again to \u201csave money\u201d for a long time now. She keeps saying that we need to be there for family, but I don\u2019t think she realizes how much of myself I\u2019ve sacrificed for her since she divorced my dad when I was in high school. I\u2019ve managed finding apartments for her/us, completing job applications for her, giving into her wishes and asks, lying about my life so that I don\u2019t trigger her OCD, putting money aside in case I need to financially support her because she doesn\u2019t have retirement or any savings of her own. She says I\u2019m the only family she has but honestly, I don\u2019t feel like I have much of a family at all.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend is supportive of me and what I want. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish for not wanting my mom to move in with me again, especially now that she lost her job and doesn't have savings to afford her current place. I don\u2019t want to sink into another depression and also lose my boyfriend in the process, but I also feel immense guilt for not taking her in and in general have a hard time saying no to her.

You're putting yourself second and her first over and over again, and that isn't good for your relationship or your mental health. I might recommend reading a book for adult children of emotionally unavailable parents. My dad is a similar personality, and its been challenging to say no, so I get it, but you have to put your foot down.\n\nI'm curious where your boyfriend really clocks in on this.", "NTA. \n\nLetting your mom live with you again will not only affect your mental health but also your relationship with your BF and your daily life. You helped before and what was expected to be short term turned into 3 years and resulted in your suffering depression.

I say none of this lightly.\n\nThe being sad on your wedding day is a red flag to me, she clearly needs some strict boundaries. Please prioritise yourself, your life and health.", "NTA. You're not responsible for taking care of your mother. Not by providing her with housing now, or funding her retirement later.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou must not do this for your own sanity.

Don't let her move in! Protect your mental health and your relationship. Your bf will do what you want, but what if you steer into another depression as a direct result of having your mother smother you in your own home with her OCD and her anxiety? Will he be on board for that?You have done your bit on mummy duty. Don't waste another 3 years in that way. Maybe having to fend for herself will even be better for your mother. That way she will not just let go of all responsibility for her conditions and let everything rest on you.", "NTA.\n\nIf needed, check over your rent lease, because it might very well say you aren't allowed to move others in, etc. If it doesn't, say it does. She doesn't need to know the actual truth, but then you aren't being the bad guy, it's the landlord that is. (Obviously don't give her your landlord's contact information or anything).\n\nIs your mother clinically diagnosed with OCD, PTSD and anxiety? Or does she just say she has them? My guess is that they at least partially exist as a means to manipulate and control you, and push you down the guilt road. What it sounds like she's done is a role reversal, where you've become the mother and she's become the child. Cut the chord.\n\nIf you really feel like you need to do something, likely as baby steps to creating a healthy boundary, then start by sending her in the direction of services that help people find jobs. Lots of organizations out there, so do a quick Google for some and send them her way. They usually help people redo their resumes, as well as apply for jobs, practice interview skills, etc. They might also have contacts to help her find a more affordable place.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your mum wants is enmeshment and is really unhealthy.\n\nI highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson, you can often download it as a free pdf if you google it.\n\nIt'll explain a lot of her behaviour, your responses, and the dynamics in general.\n\nYou deserve to have your own space, and it's not fair of your mum to try and force her way into your home.", "NTA.

She had started out taking classes for it in person but something something and she wanted to study on her own.  You can guess that that 3-6 months turned into 2 years (somewhat because of covid)... at some point she fell and broke her wrist and I was having my own health issues and we couldn't support her and her health issues... she then moved in with \"Ruth\"... she stayed with her until she passed away... stayed at the house until the executor urged her to leave (3 months) and then moved in with \"Bob\"... he lasted about 6 months and now she injured herself again but is in a rehap\\\\b center until they can find her housing.\n\nI find that the OCD person has the usual issues with loss of identity when lsoing a job and hard time finding a job like anyone... but then they have OCD on top of that which just make everything take so much longer.\n\nTwo thoughts. \r  \nFirst, someone looking for money/support will review their options from most convenient to least convenient. When you're asked by someone in a hard position, it may feel like you're the difference between their chance to succeed and their chance to fail. But you're really just the next stop on the list...there was an easier one before you and there will be a harder one after you. \r  \nSecond, \"What appears to be a crisis is often the end of the illusion that things were working.\" It's rare that someone is actually in a situation where they were OK before and they'll be OK after, if they can just resolve one immediate issue.\r  \n\n\nCan she apply for SSI? I would continue to oversee her (point her to programs, look for apts, etc) but do not take on the day to day care of her.\n\nSometimes the worst thing you can do for OCD people is to give into their compulsions...it just makes it worse.\n\n\"Mom, you need to find somewhere else to live. BF and I are starting our life together and I can't tiptoe around your OCD needs again.  I suggest you look for a roommate if you can't afford a place on your own.

Like actually laid off and she didn\u2019t quit hoping to force your hand? This whole thing seems way too convenient op\u2026 You move back to the area (with your bf albeit), she\u2019s repeatedly gone on about how you should live together again, how it would be ideal, and how \u201cfamily needs to help family\u201d  then she coincidentally \u201closes\u201c her job\u2026? the only situation she was sure you were likely let her stay with you again considering you\u2019d done it before. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case and she genuinely lost her job, this is not your responsibility. Her mental health, lack of stable work, and emotional needs are not your job to fill. You are her child, not her mother. It\u2019s beyond selfish to expect you to pick up the pierces every single time. Particularly when we all know, including her; that this is more than picking up the pieces. She doesn\u2019t want temporary housing, she wants to live with you permanently. \n\nShe wants you to be her breadwinner, therapist, best friend, and assistant, etc. That she\u2019s your mother and raised you isn\u2019t a good enough reason to sacrifice your life babe. You may be each others only family but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to destroy your life to help her. She\u2019s an adult babe, she found a way before you and she\u2019ll find a way without you/your help. For the record you would be sacrificing your life if you agree, no ifs or ands about it. Your relationship, your finances, your mental health, any possibility of an independent future. If you think the manipulation is thick now, imagine how much worse she\u2019s going to be about it as every heat passes and she gets a year older. Look I\u2019m not unempathetic to the guilt you feel, I have a mom similar to yours. The only difference is I had a dad to protect me when it got at its worst. Does her circumstances suck? Sure, but that does mean YOU need to make them better. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to occasionally help with rent or take her to the occasional dinner or take her out to shop for groceries; it\u2019s an entirely other thing to care for her the way she\u2019s expecting and/or wanting. She needs psychological help, she needs therapy; and so we\u2019re clear you will never be enough either. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you give, how much you spend, how many romantic or platonic relationships are destroyed, you will never fix her. You placating her only buys her temporary happiness, you\u2019re a bandaid. No human being can handle that, I\u2019ve tried, you\u2019ve tried, plenty have tried it never works. The weight of it takes every ounce of happiness you have. Every decision is centered on what they want, what keeps them from being upset, all to the detriment of you. Even if you think you\u2019re up for it, that only lasts so long before you\u2019re past your ability to give. \n\n\u201cFamily\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough excuse either, this is coming from someone with a huge family thick as fucking thieves. Family being there for family is not the same as what she\u2019s expecting. She\u2019s not expecting you to take her to the doctor, or help her with groceries when she\u2019s short, or running to the hospital to be by their side when they\u2019re seriously sick. She\u2019s not even just expecting you to hear her vent and give her a good pep talk or let her cry on a really bad day, she wants more. She wants all of that and more than you can humanly give without becoming mentally broken yourself. Tell her it\u2019s not feasible, talk to your bf and see if you can (temporarily) spare a few hundred a month to help her. Tell her you can send her x amount for the next 2-3 months to help her get through, but you\u2019re not able to capable to do more. It keep her fed, and buys her time to find another job without becoming complacent or becoming physically dependent on you again. \n\nEdit: Once she\u2019s in you will never get her out. You don\u2019t have the excuse of leaving for college again, and moving with your bf won\u2019t be enough because if she\u2019s living with you she\u2019ll be expecting to come. Not to mention if you think the guilt is bad while she\u2019s not even staying with you now, honestly think of how much harder it\u2019s going to be to kick her out once she\u2019s there, comfortable, and complacent. You can help, but only in a way that maintains her independence; not in a way that makes her dependent on you. Be strong, set boundaries, and stick to them. It\u2019s normal to feel guilty, that\u2019s how she\u2019s raised and trained you to feel; but that\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t act on it, just feel it, accept it, and move forward.
