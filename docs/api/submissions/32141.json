We are planning on possibly moving across the country towards the end of the next year (2024) and are actively paying down our student loans to increase our savings to one day have a down payment for a house. We are considering getting married in the future.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom (57F) was laid off from her job this week. Her rent has been slowly increasing as well and she asked if she could move into our spare bedroom while she finds a new job and a new place to live. I didn\u2019t outright tell her no, but I also did not say yes either. Here is the rub \u2013 my mom suffers from anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. She has problems that make it difficult for otherwise healthy people to be around her, let alone live with her. Things need to be her way or she gets anxiety. She can be controlling and sometimes manipulative and doesn\u2019t care about anyone else except for me (I\u2019m an only child) and her mother. She has mentioned to me in the past that she will be sad on my wedding day.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason I don\u2019t want her staying in our spare bedroom is that 5 years ago she went through the same thing \u2013 didn\u2019t have a job, couldn\u2019t afford rent, didn\u2019t want to live with her mother so she came to stay with me until she got her bearings. For the next 3 years I financially and emotionally supported my mom. I was 25 then and my world shrunk because of her OCD. I suffered from depression but kept this a secret from her. She was and still is EXTREMELY attached to me. She\u2019s told me multiple times that wherever I go she will move to be close to me.\r  \n\r  \nThe only reason I moved out was to attend grad school across the country. When I graduated, I moved back but this time I moved in with my boyfriend instead of my mom. She\u2019s been talking about us living together again to \u201csave money\u201d for a long time now. She keeps saying that we need to be there for family, but I don\u2019t think she realizes how much of myself I\u2019ve sacrificed for her since she divorced my dad when I was in high school. I\u2019ve managed finding apartments for her/us, completing job applications for her, giving into her wishes and asks, lying about my life so that I don\u2019t trigger her OCD, putting money aside in case I need to financially support her because she doesn\u2019t have retirement or any savings of her own. She says I\u2019m the only family she has but honestly, I don\u2019t feel like I have much of a family at all.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend is supportive of me and what I want. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish for not wanting my mom to move in with me again, especially now that she lost her job and doesn't have savings to afford her current place. I don\u2019t want to sink into another depression and also lose my boyfriend in the process, but I also feel immense guilt for not taking her in and in general have a hard time saying no to her.

Now you are trying to build your own life and she is showing up with needs again.\n\nIts going to be hard but you have to tell her no for yourself. You're not an asshole, not in the slightest. You're the opposite of. You're putting yourself second and her first over and over again, and that isn't good for your relationship or your mental health. I might recommend reading a book for adult children of emotionally unavailable parents. My dad is a similar personality, and its been challenging to say no.\n\nI'm curious where your boyfriend clocks in on this.", "NTA. \n\nLetting your mom live with you again will not only affect your mental health but also your relationship with your BF and your daily life. You helped before and what was expected to be short term turned into 3 years and resulted in your suffering depression. Unless you wish to have that reoccur and for her to stay with you for who knows how long, you need to say no. Your mom needs to figure out another arrangement. She may not want to move in with her mother but she should ask. \n\nYou can simply tell her, \u201cNo, Mom. That won\u2019t work for BF and me.\u201c If she pushes back be prepared to repeat it again and again. You don\u2019t need to explain more. I hope you find the strength to do what is best for YOU.", "Definitely NTA. I know it's hard, but your Mum is not your dependent, and should not behave as such. It sounds like she could use some impartial and professional help, and possibly some therapy/counselling? I say none of this lightly.\n\nThe being sad on your wedding day is a red flag to me, she clearly needs some strict boundaries. Please prioritise yourself, your life and health.", "NTA. You're not responsible for taking care of your mother. Not by providing her with housing now, or funding her retirement later.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou must not do this for your own sanity. Tell her sorry but you have your own life now.\n\nTell her she will need to go to her mother until she is back on her feet.", "NTA. A mother should never put her child in this position. She has made some poor life decisions and she will need to live with those, as we all have to sometimes. You said she\u2019s close with her mom, why can she move in with her?", "NTA. Don't let her move in! Protect your mental health and your relationship. Your bf will do what you want, but what if you steer into another depression as a direct result of having your mother smother you in your own home with her OCD and her anxiety? Will he be on board for that?You have done your bit on mummy duty. Don't waste another 3 years in that way. Maybe having to fend for herself will even be better for your mother. That way she will not just let go of all responsibility for her conditions and let everything rest on you.", "NTA.\n\nIf needed, check over your rent lease, because it might very well say you aren't allowed to move others in, etc. If it doesn't, say it does. She doesn't need to know the actual truth, but then you aren't being the bad guy, it's the landlord that is. (Obviously don't give her your landlord's contact information or anything).\n\nIs your mother clinically diagnosed with OCD, PTSD and anxiety? Or does she just say she has them? My guess is that they at least partially exist as a means to manipulate and control you, and push you down the guilt road. What it sounds like she's done is a role reversal, where you've become the mother and she's become the child. Cut the chord.\n\nIf you really feel like you need to do something, likely as baby steps to creating a healthy boundary, then start by sending her in the direction of services that help people find jobs. Lots of organizations out there, so do a quick Google for some and send them her way. They usually help people redo their resumes, as well as apply for jobs, practice interview skills, etc. They might also have contacts to help her find a more affordable place.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your mum wants is enmeshment and is really unhealthy.\n\nI highly recommend the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson, you can often download it as a free pdf if you google it.\n\nIt'll explain a lot of her behaviour, your responses, and the dynamics in general.\n\nYou deserve to have your own space, and it's not fair of your mum to try and force her way into your home.", "NTA. Stay strong.", "NTA. It didn't work out last time (does she admit that at all?) so chances are very good it won't this time. Besides, you've got your BF to consider. It's his home, too.", "NTA and also OP please choose yourself. Your well being and mental health matter too. It\u2019s okay to say no. It\u2019s your life to live - don\u2019t let her hold you back. You are not a bad person or daughter if you say no.", "NTA\n\nShe is sucking out your life.", "NTA", "Just tell her that your landlord doesn\u2019t allow visitors staying for more than a few days without being on the lease, and it\u2019s impossible for her to be put on the lease without a job. If she does get a job, just tell her you rechecked your lease, and additional roommates aren\u2019t allowed.", "You need to stop letting your mother manipulate you. This isn't really about her saving money. She should have been saving money this whole time. This is about her refusal to let you be independent. She won't leave for years (or ever). She'll insist on coming along every time you and your partner go out. Or she'll make you spend more time with her than him. And if you want time with friends, she'll guilt you for that too. I have OCD too, as well as depression, anxiety and lung cancer. I don't use any of these things to control people. She shouldn't do that to you. So stop letting her run your life. As my former therapist would say, she only has as much power as you give her. NTA", "No means no. Too young to be taking care of parents.", "Mom has the option of living with your grandmother. Tell her your space it too small for all three of you and she will need to go stay with Grandma. \n\nTotally NTA.  Stand firm on this.", "NTA - She\u2019s got to learn to function on her own for the sake of your mental health and your relationship.", "YWNBTA You have to put yourself first in this situation. Your mental health is important. Find other ways to help and support your mom without her living with you.", "Have you tried being honest with your Mum? Especially her comments about being upset on your wedding day, that's incredible manipulative to make sure your child feels too guilty to move on.

She is latching onto you and has this idea that she can always fall back on you to take care of her and that should not be the case. You need to do what is best for yourself. She has taken years of your time where you should\u2019ve been able to be a young adult and figure your own things out- not being responsible for her life. Sounds like her mother is still alive- she can go live with her mom while she gets up on her feet. You deserve to live an adult life without being her caretaker and parenting her. It\u2019s definitely from her mental illness, but to say she\u2019ll be sad on your wedding day is problematic. She sees you as hers and not as a separate human who should be able to live a separate life away from her. That\u2019s extremely unhealthy. I suggest seeing a therapist who can help you set boundaries and stick to them so you have more support on your side.\n\nEdit to add: my therapist recommended I read Codependent No More regarding my moms codependency issues. I haven\u2019t read it yet but figured I would pass it along in case it helps you."]}
