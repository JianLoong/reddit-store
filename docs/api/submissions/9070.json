Ivy is a grad student currently taking a semester off and I work full time. \n\nIvy gave birth to our daughter 4 weeks ago via c section, while our daughter was born healthy, Ivy has struggled with physically recovering from the c section and breastfeeding our daughter has been a lot for her to handle.\n\nDue to financial reasons, I was only able to take a week off from work to spend with Ivy and our daughter before I had to go back. It sucks, but we need the money. I try to be as supportive as I can when I am home but unfortunately I am not there as much as I wish I could be.\n\nHowever, yesterday was my brother's birthday. After work I met him and a couple friends at a bar. Nothing too crazy happened and I was only two hours late coming home. Keep in mind that me coming home a few hours late is not something that has bothered Ivy in the past, so I didn't text her prior.\n\nWhen I got home, Ivy was pissed and in tears that I went out (for multiple reasons). The biggest reason she was upset was because I didn\u2019t tell her where I was and she was worried because she couldn't reach me (my phone died at the bar). When I told her that I was with my brother for his birthday she seemed to be even more upset, saying \"it must be nice to get a f\\*cking break.\"\n\nI told Ivy that I was just trying to be there for my brother and that I thought she would understand. She said that it's unfair that she put her entire life and career on hold while I \"can just be a father when it is convenient.\"\n\nI pointed out that if I wasn't working we wouldn't be able to afford anything, including rent, and that while I'm sorry that I didn't tell her I was going out, it was only two hours and that its unfair of her to call me a bad father because of it. I told her it wouldn't happen again.\n\nThe fight ended pretty rough, she slept on the couch last night, she didn't answer any of my texts during the day and now has been giving me the cold shoulder since I got home. She won't talk about it and she is still clearly upset. \n\nObviously I feel bad that she's upset and I don't want her to be mad at me but I feel like this is all being blown out of proportion. I apologized and I'm going to communicate better but I feel like she's just holding onto a pointless grudge that I can't fix at this point.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1675469407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10szpq4/aita_for_not_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_i_went_out_with_my/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously she would care now even though she didn\u2019t in the past because she\u2019s trying to take care of a baby while physically struggling. It\u2019s one thing for you to go to work and quite another to go hang out in the bar with your brother. \n\nAnd then you let her sleep on the couch despite the fact that she, and not you, just grew a person and had to be cut open to get it out. \n\nGrow up and apologize sincerely.", ">Keep in mind that me coming home a few hours late is not something that has bothered Ivy in the past.\n\nby past do you mean before you added a life changing addition to your household, and when she wasn't still recovering from giving birth?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nShe's 4 weeks posy major abdominal surgery, she is struggling physically. She's caring for a child all on her own whilst being in alot of pain.\n\nYou came home 2 hours later, your phone was dead and she was worried. And now your accusing her off blowing it out of proportion.\n\nWhat if there had been an emergency with your newborn child? Or do you just not give a shit?", "YTA. You work a set number of hours a day.  She's on duty almost 24/7 because she's nursing.  On top of that, she's still healing physically from \\*surgery\\*.  So yeah, she's going to be extremely upset that you didn't tell her you were going out and she couldn't reach you.  You need to seriously grow up if you think being late in the past is the same as now when you have a small baby.\n\nHave you offered to give \\*her\\* a couple hours off so she can do just whatever? When does she get time off?", "YTA in so many ways.  Get your shit together and put your fianc\u00e9 and child first.  Your brother is an asshole for letting you come out with a newborn at home.  The fact that you don't even comprehend that makes you such a fucking huge asshole.", "YTA. Your wife was literally just cut open to have your child and you don't think to tell her you won't be home on time?  You think caring for a newborn is easy, so what's a couple more hours?  You aren't thinking like a husband or father.", "YTA, obviously.\n\nI'm not saying that you two don't have equally important roles right now, but I feel like being there for the mother of your child while you know that she's struggling is more important that getting drinks with the boys. She doesn't get to clock out right now and two hours is a lot of time to be MIA.\n\nAlso it is super irresponsible as a new father to let your phone die with your recovering partner at home with a newborn, wtf.\n\nSo, she is justified in being *that* mad at you and you **100%** owe her a more sincere apology.", "YTA. Why wouldn't you run that by your fianc\u00e9e first? She might have been perfectly fine going out if she'd known about it ahead of time. Why the hell didn't you check with her?\n\nIs it because you had a feeling she wouldn't be ok with it?", "YTA Ivy didn't care in the past because she wasn't an overwhelmed mother removing from surgery. A simple text message to let her know you would be late could have saved yourself a lot of drama and tears. Then you throw in her face that you pay the bills after failing to communicate with your fiance. I'm just curious, but how old are you?", "Sooooooo you left her home on her own with your kid after having a c section 4 weeks ago. Bc you wanted to blow off steam??? Got it.... you do know her body couldnt stop to take a break to grow your baby right??? Was your brother gonna be hurt by you not going? And you didnt even tell her you were going out?! Dude you pick where you want to be and that goes for both parents. How would you feel if she just dipped bc it was someone's birthday and left you with no heads up. It would feel crummy right? It's annoying that you cant actually realize the difference and are trying to defend a weak \"bc I wanna have fun\" attitude", "\"I was just trying to be there for my brother.\" Ugh... You need a visit from the proverbial clue-by-four. You should be there for your 4-week post C-section girlfriend and your newborn. I guarantee you that your brother would have been just fine without you at the bar. Help your girlfriend. Take some of the responsibility for the baby off of her when you're at home. Let her rest and heal. Do better. YTA", "OMG. YTA. You went out for fun (yes, it was fun) when your fianc\u00e9 has to struggle to take care of a newborn baby while recovering from surgery? Maybe you think you are hard-working, but she is chained to that baby especially breast-feeding in the middle of the night. You need to do better and help some, at least. She is working every second she is awake taking care of your new baby. Seriously, you can't be working harder than her and she feels your lack of care for her.", "YTA for the fact you didn't tell her beforehand and were just 'late home'. You have a child now, your partner needs to know where you are in case she needs to reach you. It's not like pre bany days where it didn't matter as much.", "YTA. Your wife isn\u2019t even past the recommended recovery time after a csection and you\u2019re already abandoning her so you can go drink. You ARE a bad partner and father if you can\u2019t even support your spouse during her MAJOR SURGERY RECOVERY.", "YTA dude, she is struggling with her first month post partum it\u2019s a really hard time. When your away she is alone with a newborn and yes even if you are working it\u2019s a break. Her ? With breastfeeding even her body is not hers anymore. (And and I guess even without it\u2019s still a complex subject)\n\nSo yes now things have change : you can\u2019t disappear for 2h for a drink. \nTbh I don\u2019t even understand why you\u2019re asking.\nImagin there is a problem with the baby ? Or with her c section scar\u2026.she wasn\u2019t able to reach you\u2026", "YTA.   Seriously?  She\u2019s home with a newborn after a c-section and you think it\u2019s ok to go out?   That is fucked on so many levels and I don\u2019t use that word casually.", "YTA. She's taking care of YOUR BABY while recovering for a major surgery. You needed to be home after working instead of partying with your brother.", "YTA for being late without letting her know, then having a dead phone.\n\nYou get to leave every day to go work. She has been stuck home 24/7 and has yet to recuperate from major surgery. Imagine if YOUR guts had been cut open, 7 pounds taken from your insides, and, instead of having an opportunity to heal, you were forced to immediately work basically 24/7 and every single time she picks up the baby she is in excruciating pain. Your brother doesn't need you to be there. YOUR WIFE NEEDS YOU TO BE WITH HER! What were you thinking! Did I mention: YTA! Now, go clean the house, make dinner and wash the dishes. Bring the baby to her to nurse, change the diapers and put the baby down to sleep because You messed up BIG TIME! You are the father. Yes, you are working but that baby is equally your responsibility!\n\n\"Obviously I feel bad that she's upset and I don't want her to be mad at me but I feel like this is all being blown out of proportion.\"\n\nThe classic non-apology. You don't even realize what you did was wrong. You're just upset she is mad at you. Pretty disgusting IMHO", "YTA. Yes, you were only gone 2hrs BUT she\u2019s been trying to recover from giving birth (c-sections are no joke) and taking care of your baby all day with zero breaks. On top of that, she was probably worried sick when she couldn\u2019t get a hold of you. Instead of apologizing, you kept arguing with her.", "YTA. Recovering from a csection takes minimum 6 weeks. Btw, that\u2019s a major abdominal surgery. She was home with a newborn. You couldn\u2019t even be bothered to use your brother\u2019s phone to contact her. And then you keep arguing with her over it when you could of easily admitted fault and apologized. Taking care of a newborn after a surgery where you can\u2019t lift anything more than your damn newborn is hard in SO many ways. Man up, apologize and make it up to her.", "You are being very inconsiderate of the woman who just gave you a child 4 weeks ago. Not saying you can't go out with family but the least you can do is communicate that you will be late. I'm in a relationship without children and I still get very upset when my bf does not communicate that he's gone or doing something else when I expect him to spend time with me, or come see me. In a relationship you need to think about the other person and how they might feel ESPECIALLY if she's been struggling after the C-section. And she does have a very valid point, you can just go out after work and you couldn't even text her while she's at home with the baby. Step it up dude. Also fucking inconsiderate to let your phone die, what if she had an emergency or something happened to the baby?!?!", "Wow YTA. You don\u2019t seem to be anywhere near the maturity level needed to be a father. \u201cI\u2019m working\u201d is not an acceptable excuse for not being present. You\u2019re a dad, it\u2019s time to prioritize your family.", "> unfortunately I am not there as much as I wish I could be.\n\nYou had the opportunity to be there more but you didn't.  How hard are you wishing?\n\n> I was just trying to be there for my brother \n\nYour brother wasn't in the hospital or under some stress, so its not as if you had to be there \"for him\".  Its just a birthday.  And its the child of your wife who is going through stress.\n\nYTA - You can't be everything to everyone (the brother you once were, the father/husband you want to be) when you get this big of a change.\n\nEditied: \"she couldn't reach me (my phone died at the bar)\" I assume you mean that it ran out of power - In your role and responsiblity as a father YTA for this alone.", "YTA\n\nYour wife may not have cared in the past, but you didn't have a child in the past. Communication is important when you have a new-born. She could've been wracked with worry that you never came home on time.\n\nI don't know about you but I became a father around the same time as you, but I always had the view that me and my wife were \"in this together\" and that for as long as she couldn't do things like go out and drink, I wouldn't either. Like we didn't outright discuss it but I believed it was the least I could do. Your wife saying \"it must be nice to get a break\" might literally mean she wants a break for a couple of hours.\n\nYour wife has paused her career and job because you both wanted to start a family, her staying at home to look after your new-born is not somehow less work than you do to keep paying the bills and you shouldn't view it as so.\n\nI think you need to empathise with your wife a bit more.", "Mate, there is no doubt YTA\n\n>I try to be as supportive as I can when I am home but unfortunately I am not there as much as I wish I could be\n\nMaybe don't go drinking after work then? Maybe go home to your new baby at every opportunity and be there as much as you can be.", "YTA..Just wear the AH hat.   \n\n\n1. Your woman was just cut through her stomach muscles, into her uterus to deliver your baby. Thats a LOT of staples and stitches.   \n\n2. What if she took a fall with the baby and split herself? While you were out hoisting drinks with your brother?   \n\n3. I don't think you fully appreciate how vulnerable your wife feels right now. Alone in the house with a newborn.   \n\n4. Needed to be there for your brother? Just stop. Own this, apologize profusely to her.", ">Keep in mind that me coming home a few hours late is not something that has bothered Ivy in the past\n\nBy 'in the past', you mean before she gave birth or before that day? If it's the former, it's obvious why she gets bothered now that both of you had a newborn to care for.\n\nYTA. I understand that you need to take a break. However, she doesn't get any breaks taking care of a newborn on her own while recovering from a c-section.\n\nThe problem isn't the 2 hours, but the lack of communication prior to making plans, and the inability to contact you when you 'went missing' from her perspective. It comes off as somewhat irresponsible.", "YTA\n\nThings are different after having a child. And coming home late because you're working is very different than coming home late because you took some time to go out with friends. You fucked up.", "YTA - you're a poor excuse for a father and a fiance. She JUST gave birth, and you're going out and partying. You should be embarrassed.", "YTA.\nIt's great that you are providing, but your responsibility doesn't end there, and your fianc\u00e9  is not a single parent. A couple hours doesn't seem like a big deal to YOU because you can clock out of work. She doesn't have that. She's recovering from a major abdominal surgery and caring for an infant and you get to go have drinks instead of relieving her so she can do simple things like take a shower just to try and feel human for a little while. \n\nYou need to be able to prioritize the family you have created. Start by apologizing sincerely, and then take responsibility without her having to ask you specifically for things you should be doing as a partner and father.", "You say that you feel bad that she's upset. You so\nShould  rather, feel bad because you f\u2661cked up. And boy did you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nIvy is home all day with a baby after having her body cut open to remove your baby. Keep your phone charged, go home when you\u2019re supposed to.", "YTA\n\nWhat gets me is the impossible situation where your's, your brother's and your friends' phone all went kaput at the same time.  You didn't call her because you knew she'd say no.\n\nIt should be you on the couch.", "YTA. This is not mind games. You ARE a bad father. It just hit her that she caught a glimpse of her future. The one where she has to swing all of this on her own, because you never grew up and became a present father/partner.\n\nIf she can\u2019t rely on you to be there 1) for your newborn and 2) after she just had major surgery, what is the point of being with you? \n\nYou didn\u2019t text her to let her know where you were going, or even to check in. You let your phone die when you had a newborn at home and a partner recovering from major surgery (not a single person had a charger? Not even the bartender? Oh wait, you didn\u2019t ask because you knew this was fucked up.). You put beers at the bar with your bros before your family. You picked fun over responsibility, and that doesn\u2019t fly when you have a child. \n\nYou are swanning around town like this is the pre-baby era. Your selfishness may have been quirky before baby, but now she has to deal with the reality of you as a parent/partner. It\u2019s not looking pretty. Take the reality check, apologize for being an insensitive ass (stop whining that she\u2019s being mean to you bc you fucked up), and grow up. You have a child now.", "YTA give her the opportunity to take the break she so desperately needs. You have a kid now, you don\u2019t get to flake out like this. Even if you work a lot of hours, you still need to pull your weight when you get home. She\u2019s right, it\u2019s not a competition but she\u2019s sacrificing significantly more than you right now. You wanted to be there for your brother, how about trying to be there for your fianc\u00e9?", "YTA the reason you have to pay all the bills is because she just had your baby cut out of her after carrying it for 9 months inside her body an now that baby is literally being fed from her body which is extremely painful an draining and you can't even come home on time so she can take a shower or nap. Get a clue you are no longer a single man who can just go out, you are a father and a husband an you need to be there for your family. Situations like this is what leads to women drowning their babies in bathtubs.", "YTA\n\n1.  Your excuse for not contacting her is your phone died.  Does your brother have a phone?  If yes, that problem solved.\n\n2.  Your fianc\u00e9 never had a problem with you being late and not calling before.  She\u2019s also never had a baby before either (presumably).\n\n3.  Your fianc\u00e9 just had surgery to deliver another human life.  She is in pain while she cares for this small human.  \n\n4.  Her anger was from pain, exhaustion, worry (for all she knew, you were lying in a ditch), etc.", "YTA You should have talked to her.", "YTA. She just gave birth (and it was NOT an easy birth), is caring for an infant ALL day, and is EXHAUSTED and you went out and DIDNT EVEN TELL her. Yeah, you better be apologizing HARD core.", "YTA\nYou left your fianc\u00e9 who is recovering from major surgery with no way to reach and no knowledge of her whereabouts. How do you think that\u2019s okay? \nYou say she\u2019s been struggling. Well now is the time that you should be doing everything you can to make her life easier and support her. Instead, you just added more stress.", "YTA. You should definitely give a her a break ASAP.", "YTA\n\nIts not a big deal but you ended up turning into one simply because you didn't give her a heads up and then let your phone die so she couldn't reach you. That's on you man.  Not a good idea to go off the grid without notice when you have a newborn and a struggling wife at home, even if its just for a few hours. \n\nIf you gave her a heads up and she flipped out about you going, then yeah, she would be TA since all you wanted was to celebrate your bros bday. But that's not what happened.", "Hmm. I think YTA. Sorry. Your wife should have come first. She\u2019s obviously very tired and hormonal and everything and needs the help. You can celebrate with your brother anytime.", "YTA, for not communicating and for taking her distress so lightly.\n\nShe's at home all day with the baby which is incredibly stressful, plus she's still recovering from major surgery (which restricts, among other things, how much you should be HOLDING A BABY) and by the end of the day she's probably desperate for you to come home so she can actually take a break from all that pressure and responsibility.\n\nOnly you didn't come home, you didn't ask her if it was OK for you to come home late, you didn't answer your phone, she's exhausted so she probably reacted over-emotionally and then when you do stroll in, two hours later you tell her you've been at a bar having a great time.\n\nOf course she was mad.\n\nThe first year of a baby at home -- and especially the first few months -- are incredibly intense. You're a dad now. You don't get to just playact being a single guy just because you have the privilege of being at work all day.\n\n(You also don't get to be smug about working to put food on the table, her job is way more important and intense than yours right now, and you need to have some respect for what she's going through.)\n\nImagine for a minute that you were in a car accident, had to have surgery (this is equivalent to a C-section) and your wife left you at home with the baby to go to work all day while you were recovering. Don't you think that after a few weeks of that, you'd be pretty annoyed if she came home late because she'd been drinking with friends and didn't bother to tell you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
