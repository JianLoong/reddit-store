She sat me down and explained to me that she wanted to talk to me about what I was wearing. I would like to point out that I was wearing a black shear top over a black undershirt and a pair of khaki pants. None of it was revealing. But she did point out that my bra strap was showing and the color bled through the fabric of my shirt.\n\nI was confused and a little embarrassed. I asked what the issue with that was and her response was to tell me that the students mat get the wrong idea about me. The reasoning made no sense to me at all. It is worth noting that last year a teacher was fired for inappropriate relations with a student, and I assumed it was paranoia on their part, but still.\n\nShe told me that I would have to either wear a white or beige bra, or black if i was wearing a dark color shirt. I felt attacked. I'm trying to avoid giving as much TMI as possible, but I have a more slender figure and a larger bust, so finding a bra that fits is hard enough. This one was baby blue. I don't always get to choose what color it is.\n\nI politely said \"Ma'am, I don't see how what's under my shirt is anyone's business but my own.\" She told me again what the stipulations are and that I needed to follow them. I agreed for the sake of leaving the situation and left the office.\n\nI thought about it last night and decided to file notice to leave the school. I dropped my notice this morning. I was told I was being immature about it.\n\nThe reason I'm feeling like TA is because I honestly love my job. I connect well with my students. I haven't had to fail a student yet, though I know that day will eventually come. Since I started teaching Algebra at the school, our districts math scores have gone up exponentially. I take a lot of pride in my job and don't want to let the kids down. Like now I'm heartbroken, similar to breakup goggles.

It is especially rude and inappropriate to do it for teen girls (you hear plenty of stories of girls being sent to the principal's office or home because their shoulders are showing, or their bras are showing).

I'm sure that was a big black-eye on the school and the VP is probably very worried about public perception of the school right now.  None of that is anything to do with you, but they are probably under a lot of pressure and pretty freaked out, which is leading to them being extremely cautious, beyond what is necessary based on your description.  \n\nTo me, your are NTA, but the real question is whether this is something important enough for you to leave a job that you really love.  It seems like you really love what you do (which is rare... most people hate their jobs) and are very good at it, so does this whole dress code issue upset you enough to give that up?  Obviously it is inconvenient/unnecessary and the way that the VP handled it seems obnoxious and rude but it seems like leaving behind a career that you love so much over this is ultimately not really in your best interest, and it may be better just to accept this as a sacrifice you have to make in exchange for a career you love.

However, if she was wearing  a red lace bra under 2 flimsy layers, it COULD easily fall into the unprofessional category. She talks about the neckline being high, but if the bra easily shows through, then clevage does also. If the bra blends, then cleavage tends to blend in as well, it is kind of a magical illusion w/ non-opaque tops.\n\nIn addition, she was also told the outfit would be fine if she wore another bra color.

I'd be pretty surprised if they actually did, as you said they aren't going to want to fire a good teacher unless they absolutely have to, and if they did, they'd be opening themselves up to a potential wrongful termination lawsuit considering it doesn't seem like what OP was wearing was really enough to justify firing.", ">but there\u2019s a teacher shortage right now\n\nThat doesn't let you get away with anything you want.", "Hey that was just me responding to the comment above saying \"bras and breasts don't need to be sexualized\", which is why I mentioned bras *and* breasts in the same sentence \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nAnd who said I was conflating seeing a strap through a shirt to being topless ? Clearly one is way, way, more inappropriate than the other.

Yeah sorry for having female anatomy. If you can easily find a job elsewhere you do not need to put up with anything."]}
