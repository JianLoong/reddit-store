I am his dependent and shouldn't have to pay rent to him. on the other hand, I can see why he would be upset and I still feel kinda bad either way. AITA?\n\nEDIT: thank you all for your comments. I do have plans to move in with my friend [M18] once I turn 18, just have to survive the next nine months\n\nEDIT 2: here's a TLDR of my previous post: TLDR - once I started working, I was expected to pay $150 a month as well as all the chores I do (and I do mean all of them) and babysitting my three siblings [8F, 11M, 13M. 13M is autistic].

As you know, it's their job to provide for you. I haven't read the original post, but I'll guess:if they need financial help and hope you'd contribute, that's something they need to come to you and ask, not demand. Also, your money is yours. What you do with it is nobody's business but yours. And you got a heck of a deal, so good job!", "NTA. You are his dependent. End of story", "NTA. You are correct. He is responsible for your care until you are 18 by law. \nHow sad it is that he needs to make his 17 year old feel bad that he cant \u2026afford him? Not sure how else to phrase that.", "NTA- Idk but 150 a month as a (still) child seems like a lot. And just because you once bought something for yourself doesn't straight away mean you are disrespectful.", "NTA.  Your dad's expectations are wrong; raising kids is expensive, but it isn't right to make your kids earn money to feed and clothe themselves.", "NTA \n\nJust do some extra chores & go hard on Christmas presents :)", "NTA. You're not 18, and it's your parents' job to provide for you so far. I wish people would stop treating their kids as a supplement to their income. You might want to think of a way out as soon as you're 18 because I can already see them wanting to exploit you as much as possible. I've known people whose parents not only charged rent but also kept coming with all sorts of reasons to keep milking the money out of their kids to the point the latter had to drop their classes to get more shifts as they simply couldn't keep up with the demands.", "NTA - you are a minor and are not supposed to pay rent. What you do with you money is your thing if you safed up your pocket money or worked for it. \nAnd even if you are 18 and still go to school OR University- no rent! \nWhats up with those parents? If you want children you have to pay for them. You know that. You just cannot take their money because you cannot handle life", "*EDIT: Adding to the discussion rather than just posting tangent info)*\n\nIt's hard to vote without knowing the original AITA situation. But on principle, it seems NTA. Assuming you're living in the U.S., at age 17 you should be contributing to the household in many ways - other than financial. Your parents can \"make you\" do lots of stuff around the house, but your money, your business.\n\n*(the tangent:)*  \nAround 1980, I saved and saved for months until I had $30 to buy Merlin (about $110 in 2022.)

To tack on to this, it might be worth trying to have a sitdown conversation with your family and seeing where the money issues are coming from and try to help them if you feel up to it. If not, plan to move out once you turn 18 as it sounds like once you're no longer a dependent they'll throw it right back in your face and charge you rent.", "Chores are done and presents for all are bought!
