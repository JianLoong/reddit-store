I guarantee the old owners don't really give a flying *bleep* about them since they haven't tried to actively get the cats/take care of them. Giving them back to those people is signing them up to be neglected.", "NTA\n\nThey abandoned the cats by not trying to get them back straight away.  If they had left them locked inside for that amount of time its quite likely the cats would have been dead by now.\n\nFrom just the brief info you have given it would be clear to me that they are not capable of looking after the animals properly.  Perhaps they will be able to in the future if they get help but at the moment it sounds best for the cats if they find a home that can really care for them.", "I would contact the animal control service in your area and ask what you can do.

Just a heads up, in most cities/counties, if you know the cat has owners then it\u2019s technically theft if you keep it. \n\nMy point, don\u2019t ask animal control or the shelter because they will seize the cats from you (or do so anonymously). Just do what you\u2019re gonna do. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nAs for a chip, firstly I doubt they chipped them, but just in case, do you know anyone who works at a veterinary clinic? Most decent size vet clinics have a chip scanner.", "NTA and ask a lawyer if the cats were legally abandoned because there's a good chance if it's been a while that they were.\n\nCan you find a home for the second cat?  If they're used to being together it would be nice if they could stay that way assuming they get along.", "You did the best for the cats. Period. Nta", "Don\u2019t do this. They\u2019ll take the cat and return it to the owner if it\u2019s chipped. If they can\u2019t find the owner, they\u2019ll put it up for adoption. Unless it keeps biting\u2026", "I doubt a phone call asking about how to handle a situation like this will result in them showing up and taking the cat.", "If they do it anonymously, okay. But it\u2019s illegal to keep someone else\u2019s cat if you know the owner (even if they\u2019re horrible people). So if OP gives out any identifying information, animal control will absolutely come take the cats.", "NTA. They abandoned them for a month. Please get them better homes", "You can reach out to animal control and file a report that the animal has been abandoned. Animal control has the power to \u2018seize\u2019 an animal. You can explain that you have been caring for it and want it rehomed. \n\nYou can also call a local no kill shelter, or organization like an ASPCA. They can give you advice. But likely you can come in with the new owner, surrender the animal as abandoned to the shelter, and the new owner can adopt them. There probably will be an adoption fee, but the shelter will probably do an exam and vaccinations.", "NTA, although doing the right thing may not be doing the legal thing, as pets are usually considered property and depending on whether the cat could reasonably be traced back to the owners, you might have a certain responsibility to try to contact the owners before transferring custody of the cat.  On the other hand, apparently California has some pretty harsh penalties that can be assessed when people abandon animals, so that's a trump card to hold.", "NTA. Find the cats a good home. Take them to a vet to get the chip altered or get them chipped if they haven\u2019t been.", "NTA. I think in this case, re-home the cat. When they eventually come back around, it is ok to tell them the cat ran off and you don\u2019t know where it went.", "NTA. People who love their cats don't abandon them. Full stop.", "> Edit: I also am not sure what to do if he has a microchip :/ as I don\u2019t want the new owners to have problems with that. I live in California if anyone has advice if I am NTA\n\nMicrochips just record a number. They don't record information about who owns the cat. Instead, the owner is supposed to update the number and their contact information into a database. There are a few different free databases in the USA and several more paid ones.\n\nMost owners of microchipped cats do not realize this, and that information is never ever updated the way it's supposed to be. So really, it's a nonissue.\n\nYou're NTA. These cats obviously do not feel any particular attachment to those people.", "I adopted a cat who came from a hoarder house. She had \\*severe\\* trust issues, hoarded resources for months (she would make little dragon hoards of things she liked under the furniture) and would only let us pet her if the other cat was there for emotional support.\n\nThat said, even now that she's comfortable here, no longer worries about where her next meal is coming from, wants me to pet her, and will spend hours curled up on my legs purring ... if I try to pick her up she will bite and claw at me and run away. So cat B's response may not reflect whether he actually likes the previous owners. \n\nBut that doesn't matter. They abandoned their pets for weeks, with absolutely no plan for their survival. They do not get to claim ownership now that the cats have survived based solely on luck and other people's kindness.", "I used to work with AC and animal services, and I would not recommend doing this. Animal control services across the US are nationally underfunded, overworked and undereducated. At best, a call will be ignored, at worst someone will just come enforce property code which would mean returning the cats to the hoarder until an investigation may or may not ever happen, years down the line. I know many hardworking people in animal control but they\u2019re hampered by a lack of funds and tons of red tape. They can\u2019t effect serious change and they often are forced to do the opposite of good for the animals (no investigations into low level neglect, euthanizing due to shelter space, etc) so calling them for advice is like calling an ER nurse mid-bloody triage to ask for advice on a cold. \n\nI\u2019d suggest OP get the cat vetted and microchipped in their name or the name of the adopters, and register it with the county. In the eyes of the law, that would make the cat the legal property of whoever\u2019s name is on that registry/microchip info, and there\u2019s a good chance the hoarders never did either, so animal control would then be 100% on the side of OP/the family adopting the cat. It seems like a legal loophole but in reality it\u2019s what thousands of TNR and hoarder help programs do every day. \n\nVote in local elections for more funding for your local animal services, people, it\u2019s *desperately* needed."]}
