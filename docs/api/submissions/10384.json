Granted, he is in his late 70s, is 6 feet tall, and visits from out of state \\~3 times a year. I don't have a problem with replacing the one in the downstairs powder room (and said as much to him), but I don't think it makes sense for my children (age 6 and 8), who would be the primary users of the bathroom upstairs, to use an ill-fitting one for their size.\n\nIt also doesn't make sense for me to use one as my primary toilet in the master bathroom upstairs. My side of the family has many intestinal problems (e.g., my brother has Crohns and my father has diverticulitis and was in a colostomy bag for a couple years). I've dealt with IBS, anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and internal hemorrhoids in the past. My understanding is that taller toilets are not good for people like me as they slow the speed of the bowel movement, can cause extra strain and  \nperhaps exasperate my previous issues. Regardless, I don't think I should need a medical reason or justification anyway.\n\nI'm really disappointed and hurt that my wife was also arguing that we needed to upgrade all 3 toilets to the the taller sizes, particularly as she knew my medical rationale and that I'm in treatment for PTSD (and am very sensitive to getting yelled at). She eventually capitulated after I eventually convinced her that our toilets are not actually half the size of an average toilets and we agreed that we would update the powder room only. However, this was only after she suggested that I was being unreasonable, controlling, and that it was sad she didn't get a real say in her own master bathroom toilet size because of my psychological issues.\n\nI asked her to intervene with her father to initiate an apology as I don't want someone staying in my home who feels entitled to scream at me without consequence. I also can't imagine what would have happened had one of my own parents screamed at my wife in that way. My wife's response was that I was being overly-dramatic and ruined the weekend for everyone. She says that if I did end up asking him to leave that that would be cruel to the elderly and our children for depriving them of their grandfather on this visit. I haven't done it yet (and don't in fact think I will as I'm a peace maker and want to just move on), but not doing so makes me feel like I'm being walked over.

Specifically, he (and my wife) wanted to replace all 3 standard-sized 15 inch toilets with new taller comfort ones better suited for the elderly than children or people like me with intestinal health issues. I might be the asshole because 1) he is elderly and short-tempered so I should be more patient and 2) Even though I think my reasons for not entertaining a taller toilet in my master bedroom are valid, perhaps my wife's preference for an extra tall toilet should supercede mine and perhaps I should be more chivarlous?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She said you were over dramatic and ruined the weekend for everyone, I highly doubt refusing both their demands 'ruined things'. She accused you of being controlling, unreasonable and having psychological issues. She has turned the discussion into a personal attack on you, to which borders on verbal abuse.

This is gaslighting, blaming, flipping it back on you.
