I had never met him and didn\u2019t know much about him other than he was a server at a local restaurant. \n\nIt was not Thanksgiving Dinner, just a get together the day before. I was raised to bring something with me when going to someones house for a gathering, so I brought a nice-ish ($25) bottle of wine with me. \n\nWhen I got there multiple people approached me and asked me why I would bring such cheap wine when the parents of the host owned a vineyard. I had no clue they owned a vineyard, my friend hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Even the host told me it was silly of me to bring. \n\nMy friend told me the wine would probably sit on a shelf for ten years and then be thrown out, if it wasn\u2019t thrown out the next day. That no one in that house would ever consider drinking it. I have no clue why she didn\u2019t tell me this when she picked me up at home. I was clearly holding a bottle of wine. \n\nI put the bottle on the table with the drinks and no one opened it all night. At the end of the evening when we were leaving, I grabbed the bottle and took it with me. \n\nI know this would be considered rude at a normal party and I would have never dreamed to take with with me. But because multiple people had given me shit, including the host, about how I should have known better and made me feel incredibly embarrassed for even bringing wine, I decided to not let it go to waste as for me a $25 bottle is quite expensive. \n\nMy friend recently told me that she was going to a party and if she invited me I had to promise not to embarrass her by \u201cbringing cheap wine and then taking it home at the end\u201d. She said it was a dick move and even if I knew no one should drink it I should have left it. \n\nI can see both sides. Like I said, I never would have taken it home at really any other party. Multiple people told me the wine would never be opened and I was silly to bring it. So I took it home. \n\nOkay Reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690313966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159im5z/aita_taking_a_bottle_of_wine_home_with_me/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My friend (a Christian ) wanted to bring something for the hostess. She went to a lovely baker and bought a beautiful loaf of bread that she gave to the hostess.  It was warmly received.

They were shitty to you. Including the host. Take the wine home and enjoy it - $25 isn't cheap!", "NTA simply because those other people seem like complete assholes. I would probably never want to spend with that crowd again knowing what I know now about people. They dont deserve you OP.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d should have given you better details beforehand. They definitely should have said something in the car on the way there after noticing your gift.

If I were to invite someone to a party with that family, I would include that info when I invited them. If I saw that person brought wine anyway, I would remind them & not let them bring it in.

I don't like being embarrassed for no reason.", "I'm going with NTA. Because once they start by telling you how stupid it was for you to bring wine to a vineyard, they've given you free permission to take it back. \n\nIt would, of course, have been nice of your friend to point out beforehand that the host's family owned a vineyard, given that bringing a bottle of wine is such an incredibly normal thing for guests to do. I'm sure if you had been told beforehand, you'd have brought a different gift.", "NTA. I hope you enjoy your bottle of wine!", "NTA oh my god it was unspeakably rude for *multiple* people to insult you the way they did. Your friend doesn\u2019t sound like a friend at all and the hosts were beyond ungracious.

They couldve just pawned it off on someone else later if they really didnt want it THAT badly. Instead, they refused the gift! They were very rude and a bad host.

Seems like these people just want to be jerks.", "NTA.  You're nicer than I would have been, it would have been put right back into my bag and never made it to the drinks table.  These people are rude AF.", "NTA $25 is a generous amount and they were very rude to basically berate you for bringing a GIFT. I would have taken it back too.

Yeah, OP technically violated etiquette but only after literally everyone else in the story went out their way to be rude to them.  The friend could have said something about the wine they saw her bringing.  The hosts could have not chosen to be stuck up pricks. Ditto for the other guests who had to pile on.  A $25 bottle of wine was a thoroughly appropriate thing to bring absent explicit instructions.\n\nHad it been me, I would have made sure to down that bottle before leaving and express how much more it suited my tastes than the house blend.

It should be the thought that counts and honestly I think I\u2019d reconsider the friendship.", "NTA  I've had people show up with wine I didn't really care for.  But i'd NEVER insult someone who was kind enough to show up with something.  $25 for a bottle is on the high end for most of us and I don't blame you.  They were throwing it away and had told you that.  Why would you NOT take it with you?  I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you consider new friends.", "You're not the asshole, and this person is not your friend - SHE'S the asshole. Why are you still friends with this person?", "NTA\n\nLook I've had expensive wine that tastes like piss water, wines upwards of \u20ac75 and I've had wines \u20ac5, \u20ac6, \u20ac7 that were absolutely delish..\n\nMy SIL who likes to think of herself as a wine connoisseur.. well coming home from Portugal one year, I bought a wine for my brother and SIL and they raved about it.. the wine cost me.. I kid you not.. \u20ac1.50 \nI've never admitted to the price.. they believe it was expensive because I won't mention how much it cost", "NTA. A dick move is the host talking about how cheap the wine you brought is. I don't care how many vineyards they own. Frankly, after those comments, all bets are off.", "NTA- I hope you enjoyed your wine", "Ehhhh ESH though I think you are least at fault among most of these people.\n\nI fault your 25F friend for not giving you more context about expectations at the party and especially the fact that the 30M was from a wine family. $25 wine in almost any context is completely fine but generally given the information you didn't have, you could have easily brought something else, like nice apps, chocolates, or literally anything else. Your friend sort of left you out to dry and is probably the biggest AH in the story. She even saw you had wine before you got to the party -- this was a perfect time to catch the faux pas. I almost wonder if she meant to set you up?\n\nFrankly I think some of the other participants of the party and the host especially should have kept their comments to themselves. My Emily Post / Ms. Manners side says that the host should have been gracious, accepted the gift, and not said a word about the quality of the wine. He could use it for cooking wine, regift, or donate it later, but it was poor manners to tell you it was silly. You don't embarrass a guest, especially since it can easily be deduced you had no idea who 30M was or his background / expectations.\n\nYou were NTA for all of this but it was VERY rude to bring a gift and then take it back! A house gift, even one that was unappreciated, is a GIFT and you don't take it back. Not every gift wine will be drunk during a party, it could be used later (yes, even if that seems unlikely given all the comments). All the wrongs before did not make a right. I think calling you an AH would be a bit harsh in light of being so embarrassed, but this was rude and you may not get invited to any gatherings with this social circle again (then again, perhaps that's no love lost).\n\nThis was a fun AITA btw.", "YTA for still talking to your \"friend\" who humiliated you many times.....fck those snobby guys .....", "YTA only slightly. They insulted your nice gesture which was rude. However, that being said, you should have left it because it was a gift to the hosts. Even if they were genuine in that it would sit on a shelf and then thrown away, it sucks but they can do that because it was a gift", "ESH, honestly, you need better friends. I\u2019m not sure why you want to go to another party with this group of people. In most cases, a $25 bottle of wine is fine especially at your age. And while I absolutely understand you didn\u2019t want it to go to waste, that\u2019s not your call. It was a gift. Once it\u2019s given, it\u2019s up to the recipient to decide what to do with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Well the horse started having very smelly gas and so her parents ended the ride early and arrived back at the apartment before he had a chance to bring the bread up. He went into the apartment and tried to have his friend throw the bread up to him. But he was on the second floor, so it was too high.
