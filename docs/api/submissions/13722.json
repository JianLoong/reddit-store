It's not just her home.", "INFO: Did your wife consult you before inviting her best friend to live with you? What parameters did you discuss with your wife beforehand?", "Inviting people into your home never works out. There is always a boiling over point. \nNtA-for wanting your personal space and your home to be yours. \nCould be TA-for not fully discussing the situation with your wife and setting boundaries.", "ESH - your wife probably shouldn't have assumed that her friend can stay indefinitely after your weirdly brief sounding conversation but damn man, you're almost 40 and you're complaining because your wife doesn't cook for you any more and that it's unfair that you can't play your games console? Why not help take the trash out if it stinks so bad? This literally sounds like a complaints list from a 14 year old about his mom", "INFO Did she ask you before inviting her into your home or was it a decision she made on her own?", "Oh hell no. NTA. This is not the kind of decision a spouse makes alone, without consulting their partner. Moving an adult and an infant into a small apartment? Taking on babysitting an infant for two weeks? I wouldn't lead with complaining about her not cooking for you or being intimate - she doesn't owe you that- but quiet enjoyment of your own home? That she owes you. \n\nFind a marriage counselor and insist that she comes. Look on your lease or condo rules and see if it prohibits long term guests. Worse case, visit an attorney to understand your options and tell her you'll file for a separation if she doesn't provide an end date. \n\nIn the meantime, help her friend file for child support and get her baby on health insurance.", "NTA it sounds like u got no say in any of this..so I'd refuse to watch the kid", "YTA                 You sound like a toddler!\n\nJeesuz, take a class in grown up communication, agree on some ground rules and sort this out!\n\nWindows DO open - have you tried?\n\nToys everywhere would annoy me too, so mom must put them away every night. \n\nAlso a daily timebracket where the livingroom is not a bedroom, is okay to set. \n\nThe diapers take up to much space in kitchen bin,  Mom must buy special bin for these, and keep in the bathroom, emptying it DAILY.\n\nMAN UP!\n\nCOMMUNICATE with them both instead of sulking like a 4 y.o.", "ESH, your home is your safe space and it has been disrupted. Kids are a force of nature that changes their environment. Being a parent can be rewarding and frustrating in equal measure. You are not this kid\u2019s parent. You are is godparent. You took a vow to be a second set of parents to him when you agreed to be a godparent.  Now you are being asked to step up. Move the x box. Cook for your wife. She would appreciate the effort. Talk to the mother about the garbage situation. That should have a separate pile and tossed outside after each waste. One of you can mind the child while she does that. Right now you are failing a tester for if you have your own child.", "So I 'll take it you and GF won t be having any kids soon? xD This is great for trying out if parenting is for you! Not everyone should have kids.", "NTA mostly down to the fact that it has to be both parties agreeing.\n\nDid your wife do this unilaterally or did she ask for your permission before she invited her friend and baby to live with you?\n\nImo it's time you talk to your wife about this and tell her she has to be gone within a set time span. Becuese the next step seems for you and your wife to be the kids extra caretakers at this point.", "You are a grown man who can cook for himself and clean up his own apartment so it doesn't stink.  However, I do understand how you feel like you've been put out of your own home.  I do think you sound a little whiney (\"I can't play Xbox! No nookie for me!!\"), but on the other hand, you did think this was only for a couple of days, not indefinite.  I can understand how you would feel upset by losing your simple comforts of home. \n\nThere might be another aspect of this - is your wife trying to prepare you for having a child of your own?  Does she think watching the kid for two weeks is going to whip you into shape for parenthood?  You need to talk about that because she seems pretty gung ho to play mom for this trip. You absolutely don't have to watch the kid for two weeks.  Especially since she might have family somewhere who can help. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a long, CALM talk with your wife about how long this friend is staying, and what your wife really wants out of this long term.  Maybe you could do some work to make the move happen - look for apartments, help her with finding daycare,  lawyers, counseling services.  There are cheap or low cost options if you do some digging.  And you seem motivated to do a little digging. \n\nI'm gonna go with a wobbly NAH, maybe a soft YTA, that could change depending on how this plays out.", "Since we have to issue a verdict on this board, I'm going with equal assholes, but with an extra helping of assholery on your side. You both had different expectations and you both had a responsibility to effectively communicate to your partner. However, you get the extra helping for waiting until your frustrations were bubbling over to communicate with your wife. You need to apologize for coming at her in a frazzled state and ask her out to dinner to calmly and lovingly discuss your feelings, and hear hers. To make this work, both of you are going to have to come to a compromise with both of you giving something. Otherwise, your guest is going to come between your marriage, and you don't want her to leave with you or your wife ready to take the same path she's on. \n\nETA: Move the TV and your gaming system into the bedroom so you can play when you all have free time. \n\nAnd you may be due a third helping of assholery for expecting your wife to still do the cooking. I am withholding judgment on that though because I don't know how you and your wife agreed to split up the family responsibilities. If that's her agreed upon job while you do other things to balance the load, then she gets a second helping instead.", "YTA and you're also the baby in this situation. Your wife is helping her friend instead of catering to your wants. The (actual) baby is crying at night. So what? That's life. It's not going to last forever, just until the friend gets back on her feet. Good heavens, sacrifice a little comfort for a short time to help someone in need. But if you insist on having them gone ASAP, instead of simply kicking them out, help them to find their own apartment and, if possible, affordable childcare.", "YTA\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t mind the smell probably because she was used to change your \u201cimaginary\u201d diapers all the time\u2026", "ESH but leaning toward YTa\n\nYou\u2019re clearly selfish and dislike having to share a space with these people but you and your wife do need to agree to how much you\u2019re both willing to sacrifice for this friend. Maybe a set move out date? A plan of sorts?\n\nEven though you sound bitter and selfish, we also don\u2019t know how long it has been or if there is a plan for her to get her own life.\n\nThat being said, don\u2019t have kids if you expect life to be anything but what you\u2019re expecting now. Also, maybe learn to cook you lazzo?", "NAH. It's lousy that your wife unilaterally made a decision that impacts you so much but it's also a lousy situation. I think you have to respect the fact that your wife isn't in any way the person who is capable of turning her best friend away with a baby with nowhere else to go. I think they also need to respect the fact that they need to do better at drawing boundaries to protect your very limited space.", "ESH\n\nSo... no one eats now? \n\nA timeline should have been established, given it's a small space and the baby wakes you up. \n\nThe baby can go with its dad if the mom has to go away for two weeks OR your wife could go with her maybe, give you are reprieve. \n\nYou can take out the garbage and cook for everyone else, too, you know. You're not the victim bc you can't play Xbox, maybe have a little empathy.\n\nAnyhow this is a ridiculous situation but you ALL got yourselves into it by just not being able to communicate and then being stubborn and immature about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
