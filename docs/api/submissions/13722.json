No nookie for me!!\"), but on the other hand, you did think this was only for a couple of days, not indefinite.  I can understand how you would feel upset by losing your simple comforts of home. \n\nThere might be another aspect of this - is your wife trying to prepare you for having a child of your own?  Does she think watching the kid for two weeks is going to whip you into shape for parenthood?  You need to talk about that because she seems pretty gung ho to play mom for this trip. You absolutely don't have to watch the kid for two weeks.

Maybe you could do some work to make the move happen - look for apartments, help her with finding daycare,  lawyers, counseling services.  There are cheap or low cost options if you do some digging.

You both had different expectations and you both had a responsibility to effectively communicate to your partner. However, you get the extra helping for waiting until your frustrations were bubbling over to communicate with your wife. You need to apologize for coming at her in a frazzled state and ask her out to dinner to calmly and lovingly discuss your feelings, and hear hers. To make this work, both of you are going to have to come to a compromise with both of you giving something. Otherwise, your guest is going to come between your marriage, and you don't want her to leave with you or your wife ready to take the same path she's on. \n\nETA: Move the TV and your gaming system into the bedroom so you can play when you all have free time. \n\nAnd you may be due a third helping of assholery for expecting your wife to still do the cooking. I am withholding judgment on that though because I don't know how you and your wife agreed to split up the family responsibilities. If that's her agreed upon job while you do other things to balance the load, then she gets a second helping instead.", "YTA and you're also the baby in this situation.

It's not going to last forever, just until the friend gets back on her feet. Good heavens, sacrifice a little comfort for a short time to help someone in need. But if you insist on having them gone ASAP, instead of simply kicking them out, help them to find their own apartment and, if possible, affordable childcare.", "YTA\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t mind the smell probably because she was used to change your \u201cimaginary\u201d diapers all the time\u2026", "ESH but leaning toward YTa\n\nYou\u2019re clearly selfish and dislike having to share a space with these people but you and your wife do need to agree to how much you\u2019re both willing to sacrifice for this friend.

I think they also need to respect the fact that they need to do better at drawing boundaries to protect your very limited space.", "ESH\n\nSo... no one eats now? \n\nA timeline should have been established, given it's a small space and the baby wakes you up. \n\nThe baby can go with its dad if the mom has to go away for two weeks OR your wife could go with her maybe, give you are reprieve. \n\nYou can take out the garbage and cook for everyone else, too, you know. You're not the victim bc you can't play Xbox, maybe have a little empathy.\n\nAnyhow this is a ridiculous situation but you ALL got yourselves into it by just not being able to communicate and then being stubborn and immature about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because everything is brand new to them, the things that may be causing them distress may be things adults might not twig to (lights, smells, sounds, the texture of certain things against their skin, not being near mom, etc.) Other things that can cause distress are:\n\n* Wet or poopy diaper. Even disposable diapers should be changed frequently. It is not uncommon (esp with disposables) for some parents or caregivers to let babies sit in the wet diapers until they're \"full\" or until the baby has pooped, but this is a misuse, uncomfortable for the baby, can cause rashes, and makes eventual potty training more difficult (baby is conditioned to discomfort of wet against skin). Diapers should be changed when soiled (wets or poops). \n\n* Baby might cry while digesting food or pooping, bc the sensations are uncomfy/ gassy.\n\n* Baby might cry if they can't sleep.\n\n* Baby might cry when hungry. \n\n* Baby might cry when too cold or too hot. Infants can't regulate their own body temperatures.\n\nThen, of course, there can be other reasons. Often, when a baby under your care is crying, the best way to determine how to soothe is:\n\n1. Find out when baby was last fed and burped. Feed/ burp if necessary. \n2. Check diaper and change if necessary.\n3. If neither 1 or 2 apply, pick up baby and carry them around while speaking to them in a soft voice. \n\nI used to have my baby on one hip while I did all my household chores 1- handed and narrated them to baby. If you're missing your xbox time, you could have baby next to you on the couch while you narrate the game. Turn the sound down so any noisy gunfire does not startle or upset. Beware of babies grabbing at controllers. They love those things.", ">I babysit the kid all the time.\n\nThen who are you babysitting all the time?", "It\u2019s not rocket appliances. Process of elimination. Has she been fed recently? If not, try her with a bottle. If yes, try burping her. Still crying? Check her diaper. Is it dirty? Change it. Still crying? Maybe she\u2019s tired. Rock her to sleep and turn on some white noise. Won\u2019t go to sleep? Maybe she\u2019s teething. Trying her with a teething ring. Still crying? Maybe she just wants to be held. Or maybe she\u2019s just crying because she\u2019s a baby and that\u2019s the only means of communication she\u2019s familiar with.", "How old is the kid?", "Grow up?
