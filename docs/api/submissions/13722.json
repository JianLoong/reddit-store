No nookie for me!!\"), but on the other hand, you did think this was only for a couple of days, not indefinite.  I can understand how you would feel upset by losing your simple comforts of home. \n\nThere might be another aspect of this - is your wife trying to prepare you for having a child of your own?  Does she think watching the kid for two weeks is going to whip you into shape for parenthood?  You need to talk about that because she seems pretty gung ho to play mom for this trip. You absolutely don't have to watch the kid for two weeks.

Maybe you could do some work to make the move happen - look for apartments, help her with finding daycare,  lawyers, counseling services.  There are cheap or low cost options if you do some digging.

You both had different expectations and you both had a responsibility to effectively communicate to your partner. However, you get the extra helping for waiting until your frustrations were bubbling over to communicate with your wife. You need to apologize for coming at her in a frazzled state and ask her out to dinner to calmly and lovingly discuss your feelings, and hear hers. To make this work, both of you are going to have to come to a compromise with both of you giving something. Otherwise, your guest is going to come between your marriage, and you don't want her to leave with you or your wife ready to take the same path she's on. \n\nETA: Move the TV and your gaming system into the bedroom so you can play when you all have free time. \n\nAnd you may be due a third helping of assholery for expecting your wife to still do the cooking. I am withholding judgment on that though because I don't know how you and your wife agreed to split up the family responsibilities. If that's her agreed upon job while you do other things to balance the load, then she gets a second helping instead.", "YTA and you're also the baby in this situation.

It's not going to last forever, just until the friend gets back on her feet. Good heavens, sacrifice a little comfort for a short time to help someone in need. But if you insist on having them gone ASAP, instead of simply kicking them out, help them to find their own apartment and, if possible, affordable childcare.", "YTA\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t mind the smell probably because she was used to change your \u201cimaginary\u201d diapers all the time\u2026", "ESH but leaning toward YTa\n\nYou\u2019re clearly selfish and dislike having to share a space with these people but you and your wife do need to agree to how much you\u2019re both willing to sacrifice for this friend.

Even disposable diapers should be changed frequently. It is not uncommon (esp with disposables) for some parents or caregivers to let babies sit in the wet diapers until they're \"full\" or until the baby has pooped, but this is a misuse, uncomfortable for the baby, can cause rashes, and makes eventual potty training more difficult (baby is conditioned to discomfort of wet against skin). Diapers should be changed when soiled (wets or poops). \n\n* Baby might cry while digesting food or pooping, bc the sensations are uncomfy/ gassy.\n\n* Baby might cry if they can't sleep.\n\n* Baby might cry when hungry. \n\n* Baby might cry when too cold or too hot. Infants can't regulate their own body temperatures.\n\nThen, of course, there can be other reasons. Often, when a baby under your care is crying, the best way to determine how to soothe is:\n\n1. Find out when baby was last fed and burped. Feed/ burp if necessary. \n2. Check diaper and change if necessary.\n3. If neither 1 or 2 apply, pick up baby and carry them around while speaking to them in a soft voice. \n\nI used to have my baby on one hip while I did all my household chores 1- handed and narrated them to baby.

It is absolutely relevant to this issue.

Is he helping with rent? \n\nThe reason people are taking issue here is the wording in the original post. The issues that he outlined are petty. Your point of view is that his reasoning doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s his home, but understandably he could have set boundaries upfront if these things were going to bother him. No 40 year old person (of any gender) should expect that allowing a baby to stay in your home is going to lead to a quiet, peaceful, smell-free environment. Knowing their apartment is small and without a spare bed, he should have reasonably assumed that the living room where his xbox lives would be taken up. Knowing that he doesn\u2019t have a job, and thus has significantly more free time than his wife, he should have reasonably assumed that she would not be coming home from work and cooking meals for him. All of this is common sense. \n\nThe adult solution to this problem is sitting down and setting boundaries and a timeline, something that the adults in this situation should have done, the OP included. Stop making excuses for grown adults to not take responsibility over their lives when they want to whine about petty issues with easy solutions. \n\nImagine the roles were reversed and OP was a woman, without a child, staying home because she doesn\u2019t have a job and whining that her husbands friend (one she is mutually friends with and the godmother of their child) has overextended their stay because the husband stopped cooking for her and she can\u2019t play her Xbox anymore.

I wouldnt want to be in your situation myself, as I have pretty bad sensory prosessing issues. The difference is, that had my partner brought a similare situation up to me we would have sat down and gone over everything together before desiding on anything.

I feel like someone moving into your apartment with a baby is a huge ask. Babies are loud and disruptive especially if you're someone who doesn't particularly like them. In this type of situation I would help a friend find an apartment, I would offer some money for rent if they needed, but I would find a baby in my apartment very disruptive.
