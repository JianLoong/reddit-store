She may not give a shit about football but she at least gives a shit about you enough to sit thru watching a game she doesn\u2019t give a shit about.

Stop acting like a butthead.", "Yes, YTA. It makes absolutely no sense why you wouldn't bring her along to watch with the group on the nicer setup.

My husband has always loved football and I was not that interested but I would have been very hurt if he went somewhere to ask it without inviting me. He always included me as much as I wanted to be included. After 30 years of marriage, a few years ago he invited me to join his fantasy league when there was an opening and I ended up learning enough to become a fan and now I love watching football.

She might not have been interested in football, but she was interested in spending time with you.  You better hope that she still has that interest tomorrow.", "It's baffling you have to ask, YTA. Lesson for all men out there: if your lady wants to join an activity she doesn't like but you do, it has nothing to do with the activity. She wants to be with you in an environment where you're happy and excited, probably just to watch you and enjoy sharing the moment more than anything. At least that's how my female friends describe it with their bfs which is just so stinkin' cute", "YTA you should have invited her.", "YTA.\n\nShe was looking forward to spending time with you, doing something you like. She probably bought a bunch of snacks to make it a fun party for two, and you blew her off.\n\nLet me say it again, YTA.\n\nGF, if you find this, then find yourself a better bf. You can do so much better. This guy doesn't even like you.", "Hey OP YTA big fucking time. Way to go making your girlfriend feel like shit. I hope that your girlfriend dumps your ass! Are you embarrassed of your girlfriend? Is that why you didn't invite her?

She\u2019s be better off without you anyway.", "1000% YTA, you made plans with the person you are supposed to love and support and blew them off for no good reason!", "YTA and you do what people hate the most. If you have a plan with someone you follow through, you don't cancel plans just because something better came up. And the worst is that you didn't even invite her. So it feels that your girlfriend is not very important to you and will be left out everytime something better came through your door", "YTA, you made plans with your gf first and then abandoned her when all she wanted to do is spend time with you.", "Ahhh, rookie move my friend. You shouldn't have boxed yourself in, but once you did, canceling with her was probably not the best thing to do. At the very least you should've invited her. Good luck, YTA.", "Yta.

Because as adults we have to pick and choose our battles.", "It\u2019s about being in the moment. It\u2019s about being around people who enjoy the same thing. And it\u2019s rare for the Bengals to get this opportunity. We are niner fans in my house. So I am feeling exactly how this dude feels. We have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl. These games matter to us. Just because it\u2019s not important to you doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important to other people.", "I a football fan too (go Jags), but people who act like a game trumps everything are obnoxious and need to grow up\n\nEspecially since he had plans", "Seriously? They are grown. They value certain things. He wants to feel other people excited around him. That\u2019s not a bad thing. He should\u2019ve invited her if anything. But it still doesn\u2019t diminish his want to be around people who actually enjoy the game. So he has to cater to his woman\u2019s feelings all the time? He\u2019s not allowed to enjoy things? Really? If they get married they a lifetime to spend together. It\u2019s literally ONE day that he wouldn\u2019t be spending with her and he can make it up to her.", "So he should blow her off because he got a better offer? Gross, as is your use of the phrase 'his woman'. Double gross.", "YTA. Not just for blowing off the plans you had already made, but for decided for her that she didn\u2019t want to join you at your friend\u2019s place. That wasn\u2019t your decision to make.

Now let's determine if this is a one-time slip for which you will apologize profusely and make up for grandly, or if this is the beginning of the end for what could have been the best relationship of your life.", "YTA....you didn't even give the choice to say no. Maybe she wanted to go so she could spend time with you. You have just told her football is more important than she is. I get it. Your team may be SB bound but show your gf she is just as important. You may also want to start thinking about what to do when the Eagles play the Bengals in 2 weeks", "Yes, YTA.  Hope you don't mind the single life.", "YTA", "NTA, she sounds needy, and this coming from a woman, I'm the type that doesn't need to be up under her guy all the time and I'm sure you see her everyday, so a couple hours won't kill her especially if she really don't like football, I'd be like byyye, yay quiet time", "YTA\n\nYou made plans to hang out with your gf. Then decided to ditch her for a bigger tv.", "YTA. Your GF wanted to spend time with you on an activity she knows you like.
