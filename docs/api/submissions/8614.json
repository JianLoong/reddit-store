Way to show ur gf u don't care bout her n will ditch her soon as a better option comes round.", "YTA.  You made plans and now you are blowing her off because...no reason.  The game was the same before your friends invited you.  Nothing has changed other than you feel like you got a better offer.", "Seriously? The lack of awareness with some people is astounding. Yes YTA. You completely ditched your gf without the decency to even invite her when she was clearly trying to make an effort to engage in something you enjoy.

The asshole move is ditching someone you already made plans for, for a better option, and then not even inviting them.", "YTA\n\nYou made a plan with her, and now you\u2019re ditching her to do the same activity elsewhere without including her. You basically planned a date and dumped her to have the same date with someone else.\n\nSee if the host would welcome your girlfriend and invite her.

Yep, she\u2019s going to be upset about that", "YTA.\n\nThe best thing she can do is to dump you and find someone who sticks to his commitments and gets his priorities straight.", "YTA. When my boyfriend and I first started dating, he would do the same thing (not invite me to things with his friends that he thought I didn\u2019t have an interest in). It was really frustrating for me and it took him a bit to understand that I wanted to be there to hang out with him and his friends, even if I didn\u2019t have the same interests as he and his friends do. It\u2019s just nice to feel included. I would just tell her why you didn\u2019t invite her, and then extend the invite if you still can, or make it a point to include her next time.", "YTA", "YTA. You are the one that changed the plans and aren\u2019t including her", "Of course YTA!\n\nIt's cool that you're a Bengals fan, and that you want to watch it with your friends, and you would've been well within the acceptable bounds of \"still a good boyfriend\" had you asked if it would be alright if you went to watch at your friend's place AND invited her to join, since you ALREADY HAD PLANS. She can say no, or she can go and have a  good time in spite of not being a big sports fan, I'm \\*sure\\* she's a big girl who can handle that.\n\nBut holy shit dude, you just totally ditched her in advance. Also, go Chiefs, you feline mfs are going down O.O", "Your gf is sweet in planning to spend her day watching something she doesn\u2019t really enjoy just to be with you. She cares enough about your company and your interests to give up a significant portion of her Sunday. And you just say sorry I got a better offer babe and run off with your friends\u2026 Of course she\u2019s sad. Like really you have to ask if that was an ah move. Be more empathetic or dump her. She\u2019s too good for the current you.

She should understand but she probably had a whole set up already do you really wanna miss it?", "YTA but she should also know that this is a big game for you.

She may not give a shit about football but she at least gives a shit about you enough to sit thru watching a game she doesn\u2019t give a shit about.

Stop acting like a butthead.", "Yes, YTA. It makes absolutely no sense why you wouldn't bring her along to watch with the group on the nicer setup. She was literally going to watch the game WITH YOU... I'm guessing she also shopped and made snacks/food, and then you ditched her.", "YTA. I cannot believe you went through the act of DOING THIS.

I never used to be a big football fan but always enjoyed joining a group to watch a big game and cheering with the crowd.  My husband has always loved football and I was not that interested but I would have been very hurt if he went somewhere to ask it without inviting me. He always included me as much as I wanted to be included. After 30 years of marriage, a few years ago he invited me to join his fantasy league when there was an opening and I ended up learning enough to become a fan and now I love watching football. Always tense when we play each other, but otherwise great bonding.", "YTA - she was looking forward to bonding over something YOU like and you still ditched her.. If you would\u2019ve invited her, she probably would\u2019ve been fine with partaking.", "YTA -- and I'm pretty sure you already know that.   You made plans to watch the game with your girlfriend then blew her off for your buddies and a better TV then didn't even have the courtesy to include her??????  LOL I hope she's rooting against your team!!!", "You really created a throw away account for this?", "YTA. You need to invite her. Also, GEAUX JOE!!!!", "YTA big time. She was willing to sit through a game she didn\u2019t care about just to spend time with you and you blew her off. Big no no and you better smarten the hell up before she leaves you for someone who actually wants to be around her", "YTA you got what you think is a better offer and chose it. I hope she also gets a better offer. Pretty sure she was happy to share in your love of the game but you blew that up. Do better with your next girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nWhy can\u2019t your gf come? You had plans with her, she wanted to spend time with you while you watched the game. You assumed she wouldn\u2019t want to do that at a friends house, without even asking her.", "you could have told her about the invite without accepting it and ditching her- if she really doesn\u2019t like football she might have offered that you or the both of you go there instead and you wouldn\u2019t have had to be TA for straight up bailing on plans.", "YTA.  She might not have been interested in football, but she was interested in spending time with you.  You better hope that she still has that interest tomorrow.", "It's baffling you have to ask, YTA. Lesson for all men out there: if your lady wants to join an activity she doesn't like but you do, it has nothing to do with the activity. She wants to be with you in an environment where you're happy and excited, probably just to watch you and enjoy sharing the moment more than anything. At least that's how my female friends describe it with their bfs which is just so stinkin' cute", "YTA you should have invited her.", "YTA.\n\nShe was looking forward to spending time with you, doing something you like. She probably bought a bunch of snacks to make it a fun party for two, and you blew her off.\n\nLet me say it again, YTA.\n\nGF, if you find this, then find yourself a better bf. You can do so much better. This guy doesn't even like you.", "Hey OP YTA big fucking time. Way to go making your girlfriend feel like shit. I hope that your girlfriend dumps your ass! Are you embarrassed of your girlfriend? Is that why you didn't invite her? She made an effort to do something with you that you enjoy but when your friends invited you to watch the football game at their house with a bigger TV, you ditched your girlfriend without telling her. You are a fucking shitty boyfriend.", "YTA.  Watching a bunch of men throw a ball around is more important to you than your relationship.  She\u2019s be better off without you anyway.", "1000% YTA, you made plans with the person you are supposed to love and support and blew them off for no good reason!", "YTA and you do what people hate the most. If you have a plan with someone you follow through, you don't cancel plans just because something better came up. And the worst is that you didn't even invite her. So it feels that your girlfriend is not very important to you and will be left out everytime something better came through your door", "YTA, you made plans with your gf first and then abandoned her when all she wanted to do is spend time with you.", "Ahhh, rookie move my friend. You shouldn't have boxed yourself in, but once you did, canceling with her was probably not the best thing to do. At the very least you should've invited her. Good luck, YTA.", "Yta. You already had plans.", "YTA \"Am I an asshole for ditching my girlfriend who was willing to watch football in order to spend time with me?\". The hell you think.", "Lol she\u2019s sad because of your sexual orientation \nYTA", "YTA All that for the Bungles?  Check your priorites.", "Man I hope bengals win, hate the chief. As for your issue just take the gf with you to the friends place and enjoy the game", "Yeah. This headline made me think the girlfriend would clearly be in the wrong. But nope. Cut and dry YTA.", "Mf dug to the core of the earth for this one...", "General etiquette is once you\u2019ve got plans, those are your plans.  You have to say no to the next thing that comes along, even if you would prefer it.  YTA.", "I feel like the appropriate answer would be for OP to request his friend include the gf in the invite. They were going to watch it anyways... if the friend had a better entertainment setup, it would make more logistical sense...\n\nJust make sure you bring something to the watch party, kinda the unspoken etiquette.. chips n dip, salami, cheese, Chilli. My folks and I took over some chilli to one of our neighbors when we were watching the Rose Bowl.", "It changed because it\u2019s a big game. Last game before the Super Bowl. Huge. So I\u2019d want to spend it with friends too. Plans can change. But he should invite her", "I think it says a lot about his sexual orientation.", "Here are \ud83e\ude91\ud83e\ude91\ud83e\ude91. I will wait for the update too", "Exactly, let her decide if she doesn\u2019t want to go. She has a brain and a mouth and she knows how to speak up I\u2019m sure.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the TV I think this guy is just way more into his Bros than he is into his girlfriend.", "It's not even football, it's his friends and a 'nicer tv'.", "TVsexual lol", "The headline with him referring to it as \"ditching\" her made me automatically assume the opposite. I see I was right.", "You said you already had plans to watch the game with her. You knew 2 weeks ago this could be the Bengals playing today.  \n\"Sorry, baby, this game is too big.... To watch with you...\"  \nSeriously?  \nYTA", "No it changed because his friends have a nice tv and living room - why couldnt he see if his girlfriend would be ok with a change of venue, if his friends were ok with it. She obviously was trying to do something with him that he likes to do even if she\u2019s not really interested. \n\nOP YTA", "It isn\u2019t the 90s anymore \n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s the only way to see what happens is watch it in real time \n\nI waited 3 years to see the yugioh finale as a kid, because it had to be put on YouTube years later\n\nHe\u2019ll live", "This comment is trash.", "Hey fellas, is watching football gay?\n\n/UIntelligentMeal40, probably", "I already said he was, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being with people who actually enjoys the same things you do. He should invite her. Otherwise apologize to her and just go anyways. I would understand if my husband did that. Because as adults we have to pick and choose our battles.", "It\u2019s about being in the moment. It\u2019s about being around people who enjoy the same thing. And it\u2019s rare for the Bengals to get this opportunity. We are niner fans in my house. So I am feeling exactly how this dude feels. We have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl. These games matter to us. Just because it\u2019s not important to you doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important to other people.", "I a football fan too (go Jags), but people who act like a game trumps everything are obnoxious and need to grow up\n\nEspecially since he had plans", "Seriously? They are grown. They value certain things. He wants to feel other people excited around him. That\u2019s not a bad thing. He should\u2019ve invited her if anything. But it still doesn\u2019t diminish his want to be around people who actually enjoy the game. So he has to cater to his woman\u2019s feelings all the time? He\u2019s not allowed to enjoy things? Really? If they get married they a lifetime to spend together. It\u2019s literally ONE day that he wouldn\u2019t be spending with her and he can make it up to her.", "So he should blow her off because he got a better offer? Gross, as is your use of the phrase 'his woman'. Double gross."]}
