My (M 26) girlfriend (F 24) and I recently moved into a new condo. We decided to have my family (parents, older sister, younger brothers and a cousin) and a couple friends over to watch the superbowl yesterday because we wanted to show off the new place.\n\nFor context my girlfriend is a big Rihanna fan and was extremely excited for the half time show. She's black and originally came to the U.S. as an international student from Barbados (apparently Rihanna is too) and wound up staying for work. When the performance started gf adorably lost her goddamn mind, singing and dancing with me, just generally a good time while everyone else commented on the performance, the outfits and if Rihanna was pregnant or not. Nobody seemed bothered at the time.\n\nWhile everyone was leaving and my gf had started her night routine in the bathroom, my mom joked about my gf being a little inappropriate with her dancing. She was whining and twerking on me a little at some points but it wasn't really overtly sexual or crude, just her being silly. The conversation ended there because I didn't take my mom's comment seriously. \n\nNow today around noon she facetimes me and again comments on gf's behavior. I asked her if she was serious and she confirmed so. After a back and forth she wound up using the words ghetto and vulgar to describe my gf and I got angry fast. I told her to stop being a racist asshole and that gf was just excited to see the performance and she was the only one complaining. Mom asked what she said about race and I was basically yelling that my gf's culture includes things like that and it wasn't inherently vulgar, at least in this context. Mom hung up mid argument and later I get calls from my dad and older sister berating me for hurting my mom's feelings. I don't know if this was initially my sister's feelings or if mom swayed her but she said \"it was a little ghetto, that's how they can be.\" I got pissed off again, especially at the word they and yelled at sis. Now my entire family is pissed at me except for the youngest brother (16) who does think mom and sis were judging too harshly. \n\nI haven't told gf yet because I don't wanna ruin her good mood about the night. I intend to before she can hear it elsewhere but from my standpoint she just enjoyed herself seeing one of her favorite artists perform for the first time in years and I hate to dampen her mood. \n\nAm I being TA here?", "created_utc": 1676350933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111udvi/aita_for_calling_my_mom_racist/", "score": 545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since they\u2019re more focused on your mom\u2019s precious, precious feelings than the underlying issues that led to her FaceTime rampage, I\u2019d take a step back for a while. Let it sink in that this is serious. Give them some time to self-assess and then see if they\u2019re willing to have an honest conversation. However, understand that there are only two ways for you to move forward. You can ignore their racism and sweep this under the rug, or you can hold a hard line and demand accountability.

And just because a dance is influenced by something older, doesn't mean the newly created dance isn't necessarily sexual and provocative in nature. Once it's used in a sexual and provocative manner by the population at large, INCLUDING BLACK CULTURE, it stops being seen as just a traditional, non-sexual dance. That's how things work.\n\nYour rage at white culture has nothing to do with this, especially when it's been used as a sexual dance just as much, if not more, in black culture. Things change and evolve (or in some cases devolve) over time. Just look at the swastika, which used to be a symbol of good luck in Hinduism, and now is seen almost exclusively around much of the world as a symbol of hatred and intolerance, thanks to Nazi Germany.", "The historical context of it doesn't really matter. What matters is how it's typically used now, which is often sexually.", "WHEN did I mention diversity?! Me saying don\u2019t disrespect black peoples culture and cultural norms has nothing to do with your point lol. Also, offensive in the culture you are in?? What are you talking about?? She\u2019s a black woman so she\u2019s associated with black culture?? What are you talking about??  Who\u2019s culture??? They are in AMERICA", "She was in her own home enjoying herself. \n\nIf his mother was so uncomfortable she could have simply left.", " twerking isn\u2019t foreplay nor is it sexual so what\u2019re you talking about", "Okay, so what he invited her? She\u2019s grown she can drive \n\nYou have no idea what you are taking about.. obviously the dance was derived from Mapouka.. twerking isn\u2019t only 30+ years old WHERE are you getting your information from, Britannica?? Your saying because it\u2019s derived from the traditional dance that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not older.. but it does. Twerking is obviously very grounded in the traditional dance and twerking is done all across the African diaspora as a non-sexual dance lol YOU SAYING or PERCEIVING twerking as a sexual dance does NOT make it a sexual dance regardless of what you think. At the end of the day it\u2019s a form of dance that\u2019s very cherished to the African diaspora and done non-sexually across it by men women AND children. You SAYING it\u2019s sexual does not MAKE it sexual that\u2019s your white view of a cultural dance lol FOH it\u2019s like telling an Indian woman that her cultural wedding clothing is to flashy. \n\n\n White culture isn\u2019t a thing so what the hell are you talking about? You can sexualize ANYTHING that doesn\u2019t make it inhertily sexual. People have foot fetishes, are feet sexual?! Foh. Your right the dance changed and evolved to what black artists coined as twerking, so? That doesn\u2019t make it sexual and that doesn\u2019t make it any less meaningful.", "It obviously wasn\u2019t used sexually this time and it doesn\u2019t matter how typical it is historical context DOES matter and if you don\u2019t your ignorant it\u2019s not just a dance it\u2019s culturally significant. If she doesn\u2019t like it she can go. Foh", "Yes, they are in America, and in America, performing sexually suggestive acts whilst around family members is considered in poor taste.\n\nYou were the one who brought up different cultures (aka cultural diversity), implying that this act was okay because it was okay in black culture.  \n\n(Though, as an aside, I find labeling this as \u201cblack culture\u201d a bit\u2026problematic.  The overwhelming majority of middle-aged African-American women would not be okay with their son\u2019s girlfriend doing this at a family gathering.  Maybe there\u2019s certain black subcultures in which this would be okay, but, for example, in the deeply religious African American population within my community?  No way.  So what does it mean if they would find it offensive?  Are you somehow implying they don\u2019t participate in black culture?  Or maybe this phenomenon isn\u2019t \u201cblack culture\u201d, merely a subgroup of it, and not nearly as widespread as you\u2019re claiming by appropriating this behavior as part of black culture in general.)\n\nHowever, we\u2019re digressing: the point is, whether it is cultural or just bad manners, in America it\u2019s generally accepted that we don\u2019t perform sexually suggestive acts around family members.\n\nCalling this out as rude is not about disrespecting someone else\u2019s culture, cultural identify, and cultural diversity.  It\u2019s about respecting the culture you are in, and on a more basic level, just being mannerly.  Do not perform acts that are going to leave the person (people) around you uncomfortable.  I wouldn\u2019t think that that would have to be said, but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "True!  She was in her own home, enjoying herself.\n\nHowever, I would disagree that that is the slam-dunk argument stopper you seem to think it is.\n\nShe also had a guest in her house, and generally, it is in poor taste to perform sexually suggestive acts around guests.\n\nAppropriate behavior when alone in your house =/ appropriate behavior with a guest in your house.", "According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, tweaking is defined as:\n\nsexually suggestive dancing characterized by rapid, repeated hip thrusts and shaking of the buttocks especially while squatting\n\nPerhaps you don\u2019t find twerking sexual, but apparently that opinion is not shared by the majority.", "Hahaha, alright, you make up definitions for whatever words you want, bud.", "It does matter how things are typically used now, whether it be dances or words.  That's why we don't (and rightfully so) use certain words now even if they had harmless intended uses back in the day.", "She was in her own home gtfo", "Lol most Middle Ages black women wouldn\u2019t GAF ESPECIALLY because she\u2019s from Barbados.. they would be joining in Foh \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 how you gon tell a black person how another black person would react? Also to bad it\u2019s the truth it\u2019s black culture. It\u2019s not up to you what\u2019s disrespectful or offensive. Also the black people you probably know are probably those old southern black women who call everybody a hoochie.. don\u2019t nb care what they think and they got skeletons in they closet to. Be the same ones have 7 kids wit 3 different men talkin bout praise the lord \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 also, it\u2019s still black culture regardless of if every single black person participating in it or not and if we define culture by everybody inside it participating we would have no culture. It IS widespread.. how TF.. are you.. a white woman.. gonna tell ME.. a black person who\u2019s only ever grown up around black people and Hispanics how black communities operate??\n\nMaybe In WHITE america but America is a melting pot of different cultures. She\u2019s JUST AS AMERICAN as anybody else If not MORE than. There is no such thing as an American culture where cultures aren\u2019t allowed to express themselves that\u2019s un-American. YOUR idea of America is NOT everybody else\u2019s idea of America and what you do in YOUR household isn\u2019t what everybody else does in there.\n\nThe culture \u2018you are in\u2019 is HIGHLY subjective in America. You have a white washed lens of America and I suggest you get out the house more", "Shhhhhhhut up. \n\nWhat is and isn't  \"sExuAlLy SuGgEsTiVe\" is incredibly subjective. \n\nI'm a bit of a nudist right? If someone told me to put something on in my own home because it's \"SuGgEsTiVe\" they would be shown the door and not invited back.", "Nobody asked marrium Webster\u2026.?? Who really cares ?? They are run by white peoples and have hundreds of outdated definitions", "Back in XVI centure waltz was also considered an inappropriate and scandalous dance. It was mainly danced in private parties in order to avoid disapproval. 3 centuries later that place was taken by tango.\n\nSo dance can be considered as vulgar by society surrounding it at that moment. Nowdays, twerking is sexualised thanks to the pop culture despite it's original roots. It became a norm to a younger generation so a part of it doesn't see the dance as sexual. However, for the older generation - it is not a surprise that they see the dance as inappropriate. And this applies to every race.\n\nSo no, I wouldn't say that racism was an only issue. Yet, this vulgar dance called out a hidden racism in OP's mother.", "Thanks! Will do, as I hope you will too!", "Are you talking about slurs? Your comparing twerking to slurs? Lord pls", "So, your argument boils down to: \n\n1) It\u2019s black culture because I say it is\n\n2) If doing [X] is part of someone\u2019s culture, somewhere, then everyone America should accept that, because\u2026melting pot. \n\n3) No one should bother about silly things like \u201cmanners\u201d and \u201csocially acceptable behavior\u201d if point 2 remotely applies.\n\n4) Anyone who dares be offended by any of this is some sort of oppressive -ist.\n\nOkay, then.", "If you want me to \u201cshut up\u201d I would suggest not debating with me.\n\nAnd yes, it would be rude to invite someone over to your house without informing them you were a practicing nudist first.\n\nAlthough don\u2019t take my word for it.  Invite a bunch of co-workers over and tell me how it goes.", "Yes, who should really care about the definition of words they use?\n\nI certainly can\u2019t argue with such a passionate and well-reasoned assertion.", "Nah, I\u2019ll stick with what they actually mean. My worldview doesn\u2019t require me to make up my own definitions.", "Yes, I am comparing them in the manner that is actually relevant to what is being discussed.  A lot of current slurs were not initially slurs and just evolved into them over time.  The same thing applies to dances, and other acts and behaviours.  \n\nBut hey, just say \"you're comparing them to slurs\" because you don't actually have a worthwhile counterargument.", "Girl.. black culture because it IS black culture. It\u2019s undeniably black culture. It\u2019s not debatable lol. \n\nThey should. You should never disrespect another culture REGARDLESS of where your at. If you think it\u2019s acceptable to disrespect another culture your a Xenophobe. \n\nBecause socially acceptable is subjective.
