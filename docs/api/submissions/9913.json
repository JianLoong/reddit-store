My (M 26) girlfriend (F 24) and I recently moved into a new condo. We decided to have my family (parents, older sister, younger brothers and a cousin) and a couple friends over to watch the superbowl yesterday because we wanted to show off the new place.\n\nFor context my girlfriend is a big Rihanna fan and was extremely excited for the half time show. She's black and originally came to the U.S. as an international student from Barbados (apparently Rihanna is too) and wound up staying for work. When the performance started gf adorably lost her goddamn mind, singing and dancing with me, just generally a good time while everyone else commented on the performance, the outfits and if Rihanna was pregnant or not. Nobody seemed bothered at the time.\n\nWhile everyone was leaving and my gf had started her night routine in the bathroom, my mom joked about my gf being a little inappropriate with her dancing. She was whining and twerking on me a little at some points but it wasn't really overtly sexual or crude, just her being silly. The conversation ended there because I didn't take my mom's comment seriously. \n\nNow today around noon she facetimes me and again comments on gf's behavior. I asked her if she was serious and she confirmed so. After a back and forth she wound up using the words ghetto and vulgar to describe my gf and I got angry fast. I told her to stop being a racist asshole and that gf was just excited to see the performance and she was the only one complaining. Mom asked what she said about race and I was basically yelling that my gf's culture includes things like that and it wasn't inherently vulgar, at least in this context. Mom hung up mid argument and later I get calls from my dad and older sister berating me for hurting my mom's feelings. I don't know if this was initially my sister's feelings or if mom swayed her but she said \"it was a little ghetto, that's how they can be.\" I got pissed off again, especially at the word they and yelled at sis. Now my entire family is pissed at me except for the youngest brother (16) who does think mom and sis were judging too harshly. \n\nI haven't told gf yet because I don't wanna ruin her good mood about the night. I intend to before she can hear it elsewhere but from my standpoint she just enjoyed herself seeing one of her favorite artists perform for the first time in years and I hate to dampen her mood. \n\nAm I being TA here?", "created_utc": 1676350933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111udvi/aita_for_calling_my_mom_racist/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother has zero say in how your girlfriend acts in her own home. If she\u2019s so offended, she doesn\u2019t need to visit next time. Next, she responded to your girlfriend\u2019s playful dancing with a full-on FaceTime ass-chewing. That\u2019s not a reasonable response. Third, what she said was absolutely racist, indisputably so. Nobody put those words in her mouth. She wants to say racist shit, she has to deal with being called racist. So, to recap:\n\n1. She overstepped her authority by trying to control how your girlfriend acted in her own home.\n\n2. Her criticisms had very clear repressive overtones. She tried to shame your girlfriend because she thought her dancing was too sexual.  \n\n3. She was racist. \n\n4. Your sister was also racist.

They\u2019re unwilling to be challenged about their racism, and therefore unwilling to grow beyond it. Since they\u2019re more focused on your mom\u2019s precious, precious feelings than the underlying issues that led to her FaceTime rampage, I\u2019d take a step back for a while. Let it sink in that this is serious. Give them some time to self-assess and then see if they\u2019re willing to have an honest conversation. However, understand that there are only two ways for you to move forward. You can ignore their racism and sweep this under the rug, or you can hold a hard line and demand accountability.
