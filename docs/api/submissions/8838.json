Ever since I moved in the best friend, Anthony (not his real name) has made it his mission to break me down. \n\nAn example of this is a few weeks ago I had a friend over for coffee and we were in the middle of catching up when Anthony walks in the room and starts going off at me for having a history of poorly timed humour. For context I used to be very mentally unstable. Within a minute my friend stood up and told Anthony to back off and leave the conversation he wasn\u2019t invited to.\n\nToday was my fianc\u00e9s birthday and I got up super early to make him breakfast in bed and clean up around the house a little. Several hours later one of the other people in the house used the kitchen and didn\u2019t wipe up a small spill. The fianc\u00e9 and I were in the living room eating cake and playing video games when suddenly Anthony comes barging in yelling at me for leaving a huge mess in the kitchen and making the house unliveable. For 5 uninterrupted minutes did this verbal abuse go on about how I\u2019m simply the worst person to exist. Not giving me a single moment to explain that it wasn\u2019t me. Through all of this my fianc\u00e9 stayed silent, allowing me to be berated and yelled at. After it all finished I got up and walked to my bedroom.\n\nI\u2019ve started looking at apartments because I\u2019ve spent the last 2 years living like this and it\u2019s driving me insane. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019m overreacting but I\u2019m just over it. So AITA?\n\nEdit:\nI talked to my fianc\u00e9, he\u2019s going to talk to his best friend about this and we\u2019re looking at potential apartments.\nIf he lets it happen again, he\u2019s single.", "created_utc": 1675252457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qsbyd/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_after_my_fianc\u00e9s/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But why is all the blame on Anthony, don't get me wrong he's a huge ah, but your fiance sitting there and allowing his friend to talk to you like that makes your fiance, imo worse!! Please if you move..dump your spineless disrespectful fiance as well.", "NTA find a new fianc\u00e9 while you are at it.", "NTA\n\nYour fiance sucks. If he can just sit by and watch as you're getting shouted and berated at, what else is he just going to let slide? Is this really the type of guy you want to marry? I wouldn't. \n\nHe can live with his \"bestie\" and roommates and be single for the rest of his life. No woman will put of with that", "NTA either Anthony doesn't like you, is threatened by you or is in love with your fiance. Good that you are going to move out, follow through on that. Your fiance is more disturbing,  he didn't stand up for you at all and then gaslight you by saying you're overreacting??? He should be standing up for you as your friend did, even more than your friend did to be honest. I could use some choice words for your fiance but don't want to be barred. Tell Anthony to back off and leave you alone. Then make your get away from this toxic situation.", "NTA. Get your new apartment,  and dump the fiance. Not speaking up in your defense, or setting a boundary, is consenting to the abuse. Also, it's really weird that a 34 year old WANTS to live in a house with people so much younger... like people his own age probably wouldn't put up with his crap.\n\nI think you've outgrown this toxic situation, OP.", "NTA - Anthony is a flaming AH and your fianc\u00e9 - you need a new one that stands up for you.", "NTA this guy is a bully, fefinitely find an apartment, and a bf that will stand up for you.", "NTA - you shouldn't have to deal with the verbal abuse and the fact that your partner allows someone to treat you so poorly while he just sits back in silence is absolutely insane to me. Are you even sure this is someone you'd want to marry?", "NTA - And I would recommend to rethink your relationship with your fiance, because he is TA for not sticking up for you!", "NTA. This is unacceptable behavior. You do need to move out and you need to do so without the fianc\u00e9. Just note, if he is willing to let his friend verbally abuse you right in front of him, he is not a real partner for you. Partners have each other\u2019s backs and support one another. If he is willing to step up to the plate going forward, great, but at this time it sounds like it is best to remove yourself from this harmful household first then reevaluate your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 to determine if the two of you really want to move forward into marriage.", "NTA that's not behavior you should put up with.", "NTA, and reconsider your engagement. Your friend stood up for you. Why didn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9?", "NTA, its a hostile environment. If your fianc\u00e9 can't see that, then leave him behind.", "NTA but dont just move out. Tell your fiance you will not be marrying him. He stood there and allowed that abuse.

Its your home too and you can actually leave it untidy if you will be cleaning it up.\n\nYour fiance allowed abuse to happen\n\nHave some self-pride and dignity and tell him that you wont get married and until he can see what he and friend did wrong you wont reconsider marriage. If he does see it, then he needs to understand that his friend is never allowed near you or in your home.", "Anthony is upset you disrupted the dynamic of his roomie relationship with his BFF/your fianc\u00e9. It happens a lot. And your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t staying neutral. He\u2019s picking his BFF\u2019s side. He\u2019s letting him go off on you without even moderating or acting as a voice of reason. He could have simply told Anthony to chill out because it was his birthday.\n\nWriting is on the wall here.

I think you need to have a frank conversation with you.", "NTA\n\nTake that red flag he's throwing around, tie it around you like a cape and supergirl right out of that relationship. Your fianc\u00e9 has clearly shown you where you stand. Even if you did make that mess, he should have never let his friend talk to you like that. Silence actually says alot. He values his friend more than he values you. This is your life. Do you want to walk on eggshells around his abusive friend just to be with him? Is he really worth it?", "NTA - You should get your own place to live.", "NTA and DO NOT MARRY THIS MAN. This dude is allowing you to be verbally abused. Wake up. He does not have your back.", "NTA - Your fianc\u00e9 not defending you or even commenting on the situation is a major red flag... I mean... No matter where you stand, doing nothing is still doing something!", "NTA. Find a new place to live and a new Fianc\u00e9 in the process.", "And why is your fiance so great? He lets this grown assed man verbally abuse you and doesn't say a word. He clearly is keeping his best friend around and has no plans of putting an end to this behavior.  Even if you move, it will not end. This will be a part of your life as long as your non-protective fiance is in your life. Is that what you want? You. Eed to make a decision here. This jack will be best man at your wedding.  Want that ruined? He'll be over to watch aports..sports... feel like hearing about what a horrible host you are? Him berating you for being a terrible mom in front of your future kids. That's coming. Unless by some miracle your man starts to care and breaks up with the bf, but that doesn't look likely. \n\nNTA", "The thing your friend did - the one where they stood up and defended you? This is what your fianc\u00e9 should be doing. Either he\u2019s intimidated by Anthony or he refuses to choose between you two so he chooses to not react instead. Neither is good.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA but let me be clear: if Anthony remains in your life in any way, shape or form, this isn\u2019t gonna end when you move out. Do you really want to be married to someone who\u2019s gonna allow your abuse for the rest of your life?", "NTA. Get out of that house, and get rid of that fianc\u00e9. I know people are always quick to tell you to leave relationships on here, but this time it\u2019s warranted. Your fianc\u00e9 is allowing abusive behavior towards you that you said is driving you insane. That is not how you act when you truly love and care for someone else. \n\nAnd  a 34 year old living in a house full of roommates who are younger than he is\u2026bullying a 20 year old? This guy has not gotten far in life, and I\u2019m guessing he never will.", "NTA. Anthony has issues he\u2019s projecting on you and you\u2019ll continue to be his punching bag. I get that not everyone is confrontational but you deserve for your partner to at least stick up for you and validate your feelings. You should reconsider this potential marriage.", "NTA. But your fianc\u00e9 is the problem here. You're 20 and your fianc\u00e9 sits there while his 34-year-old best friend berates you, and this has been going on since you were 18. Your friend with whom you had coffee stood up to Anthony within a minute, while your fianc\u00e9 sits there while Anthony goes off on you for five minutes. For your own sake, I hope you get out of there and leave the fianc\u00e9 with Anthony.", "Let me give you a tip as someone who lives with someone like this.\n\nIt will never stop\n\nIt will destroy you mentally\n\nGet your own place and save yourself years of mental trauma.\n\nNTA", "NTA I think it time to call it. It means everything, the place you are staying and the relationship. You deserve to have someone who stands up for you especially when it is their friend who is acting up.", "NTA\n\nBut seriously, don't marry someone who will sit there allow you to be bullied and abused. What's even worse is that this has gone on for two years and nothing has ever been said, meanwhile gaslighting?\n\nLeave and don't look back.", "I don't think you need a husband that can't even stand up for you or call off his attack dog. I don't think it will get any better either. If he can't pretend to care when you're engaged, what about when you're already married?\n\nNTA", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 and his best friend definitely are.", "You need a new flat and a new fianc\u00e9 by the sound of it!\n\nIf someone had tried to stand and scream at someone I loved for 10 minutes (for something she didn't even do no less!), they'd have been told in no uncertain terms to shut up and watch their effing mouth!", "NTA", "NTA get your new apartment and bin the fianc\u00e9 too if he thinks it's fine for his friends to treat you this way and says nothing to defend you", "Why does he hate you so much? Examples please.", "NTA but your fiance and Anthony are, why didn't your fiance stand up for you? If someone did that to my wife they'd regret  it.", "INFO.  do you actually pay rent, utilities, regularly clean, just not as a birthday gift?  Just trying to figure out is this a long born resentment built of frustration on his part if you\u2019re a freeloading interloper here as far as he\u2019s concerned?", "Of course NTA\n\nBut after him berating you you definitely should have told him that it wasn't even you who left the spill and then go to your room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
