You're getting sick because of his family's lack of hygiene and he and his father fussed at you for finding a way to deal with the fallout.

This family is deeply dysfunctional and if your bf knows you're getting sick from the food and won't stand up for you, he's just as bad. \n\nI do think OP should have connected the match to the burning smell sooner and spoken up (as awful as the dad sounds otherwise, he's not wrong for freaking out if he smelled burning).

You should have been honest about the source of the burning smell. **But** your bf's dad has also created a dynamic where I understand why you weren't comfortable speaking up. Not allowed to use the bathroom fan, not allowed to use PooPuri, not allowed to use a match -- individually I can understand why he would have an issue of each of these, but forbidding all of them is just asking for a stinky bathroom, which is also embarrassing for you. Yes, it's his house and he's allowed to make rules, but living with other humans means you need to allow them some dignity with their bathroom habits. \n\nAlso, I know you didn't want to get into the reasons why and I'm not going to ask you to. But I'll just say that if you are ONLY getting diarrhea at your bf's house, it seems like there is either a food handling issue or you have a dietary intolerance they aren't respecting. That's fucked up.~~", "Just FYI, lighting a match doesn\u2019t do anything to stop the smell in the bathroom, it just covers it up because the burning sulfur smell is stronger.

In general situations and especially in unreasonable situations. For example someone raised in a household where feeling at home in their own home was normal, they would have questioned the food the first time they were sick. They would have left immediately or never visited again when your bfs Dad seriously asked you not to flush the toilet or use the toilet at night. For those of us raised in abusive homes, our first response to to change our behaviour, not question the request. The only exceptions would be if someone raised in a home where they never had to tiptoe around a parent would accept this behaviour is if the romantic relationship with their bf was abusive.

The boss berated her for wearing her pjs. The person came to Reddit asking if she was the AH for not changing out of her pjs, and Reddit convinced her she needed to complain to HR. HR got the CEO involved, the CEO fired the Boss and apologised to her but was very firm that she shouldn't have picked up the phonecall or agreed to pick her boss up in the first place, and going forwards they were going to send her on training on how to say no to things that were clearly inappropriate.
