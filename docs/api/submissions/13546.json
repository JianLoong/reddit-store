You're getting sick because of his family's lack of hygiene and he and his father fussed at you for finding a way to deal with the fallout. It's not your fault that the dad is hyper sensitive to smells. It's also weird that the dad is so sensitive to smells, but not really about leaving raw meat out.

Also, is the dad a blood hound? Lol How is he smelling this whole later through bedroom doors while dead asleep.", "NTA. So much NTA.\n\nFolks, if a match has been run under water then short of the intervention of God himself that match is not going to start a fire. Good grief.

It\u2019s great for taking care of a stinky bathroom without all of those fruity/floral sprays. As long as you run it under water before tossing it, you\u2019re fine.

The dad is a ridiculous control freak about bathroom fans/PooPurri/matches but won't get a handle on the filthy kitchen that is LITERALLY making you sick? This family is deeply dysfunctional and if your bf knows you're getting sick from the food and won't stand up for you, he's just as bad. \n\nI do think OP should have connected the match to the burning smell sooner and spoken up (as awful as the dad sounds otherwise, he's not wrong for freaking out if he smelled burning). But that's small enough potatoes compared to the rest of what's going on that I'm revoking the judgment that OP sucks too.\n\n~~I have to go with ESH. You should have been honest about the source of the burning smell. **But** your bf's dad has also created a dynamic where I understand why you weren't comfortable speaking up. Not allowed to use the bathroom fan, not allowed to use PooPuri, not allowed to use a match -- individually I can understand why he would have an issue of each of these, but forbidding all of them is just asking for a stinky bathroom, which is also embarrassing for you. Yes, it's his house and he's allowed to make rules, but living with other humans means you need to allow them some dignity with their bathroom habits. \n\nAlso, I know you didn't want to get into the reasons why and I'm not going to ask you to. But I'll just say that if you are ONLY getting diarrhea at your bf's house, it seems like there is either a food handling issue or you have a dietary intolerance they aren't respecting. That's fucked up.~~", "Just FYI, lighting a match doesn\u2019t do anything to stop the smell in the bathroom, it just covers it up because the burning sulfur smell is stronger.

My mom would tell us that\u2019s why we were sick and everything, but she would never actually tell her in-laws to not touch raw meat and then cut vegetables for a salad or whatever out of fear of being impolite.\n\n\nSo basically I was taught as a kid to eat the damn food no matter what and I do not actually know how to refuse food.", "SO MUCH \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "It\u2019s not just one way. We visit my family too and they do things my boyfriend hates like they have the TV on loudly all day long and they snore and they have a cat that he is allergic to as well. I think it\u2019s okay to tolerate things we don\u2019t love for the sake of the people we love and I don\u2019t think that makes me a human doormat.", "Op said in another comment that they leave meat out to thaw all day, dont put leftovers in the fridge fast enough and ofc cross contamination. \n\nI would not wanna eat at that place! I'd never go back tbh.", "No.  But a dad who will like to hear from his daughter first, before she starts burning things in part of the house where suppose to be no fire.   Is proper communication, too much to asked from people?", "Are you OP's mom?  Always suggesting to mask the smell, instead of communicating with in-laws?\n\nAnd yes few people are sensitive to sounds, smell and very light sleepers.", ">Poo-Pourri\n\nI see! I am not from the US/Europe originally and my eyes somehow glimpsed over this. Thanks.\n\nAlso the Dad sounds really controlling. Who tells the guest to not use essential oils even if those are essential oils?", "Told her.", "Once again, and slower this time since you seem to be struggling with comprehension, LOOKING FOR THE SOURCE WAS NOT THE PROBLEM.\n\nThe verbal abuse was the problem. \n\nCalling her dumb and embarrassing was the problem.\n\nIntentionally and regularly food poisoning her through leaving raw meat out for hours in the kitchen, despite her desperate pleas for better food safety standards was the problem.", "OP says in another comment \"There are a lot of issues in the kitchen\" so I'm guessing that means sanitation/hygiene issues are making them sick.", "what precautions can she take lol", "Bro, IBS is a thing. People have diarrhea for no reason all the time for no clear medical reason, and there is literally nothing GIs can do about it. This is my life. 10% of the US has this condition. Leave this poor girl alone.", "The fact that he berated OP and then fell sound asleep says he's the same.", "Did I stutter? It doubt the food is handled badly enough, that every single time she goes, there is a problem. It must be something else.", "Actually, the USDA says leaving meat to thaw on the counter is not safe. Thawing in the refrigerator is best. Even leaving the meat thawing issue aside, she\u2019s also mentioned not refrigerating leftovers quickly enough and cross contamination. \n\nNone of these are safe food handling methods.\n\nEven if his family can handle what they\u2019ve created, that doesn\u2019t mean that her system can do so. (The stress is just an added bonus that makes it more difficult.) Also, some day their poor food handing practices may well brew up something that even their digestive systems can\u2019t handle.", "Yup", "Yeah I\u2019m sure waking people up in the middle of the night to say \u201cI lit one match\u201d would go over well", "@raj_u are you sure you're not OP's FIL?", "She didn't \"burn something\" she lit a match. You're outright lying about what took place now and trying to gaslight OP into thinking the diarrhea these people are GIVING her is somehow her fault.", "Ah, this makes sense. It is much harder to see something as wrong and stand up for yourself if you were raised to tolerate that same thing. I think maybe just telling your boyfriend, if you haven't already, what you situation is, and then telling him that you cannot do it anymore\u2014cannot eat the food or put up with being shamed like that by him and his family\u2014and see how he reacts. You might be surprised what it is like to simply stand firm. Rehearse to yourself what you will say, as in, \"no, I am not going. I won't be in that situation again,\" and then whatever he says, just repeat with a no. \"No, I won't eat food that I know makes me sick,\" and let that play out. Either he will say, \"okay then, we'll bring our own food and I won't let anyone make fun of you over it,\" or some such helpful solution, or he will insist that nothing should change but your reaction. Once he knows how hard this has been for you, if he chooses the latter, then he is telling you where you stand in his life, and you know you don't want to put up with that. Bad enough that you had to as a child, but you are not a child anymore.", "Loud TV, snoring, and a cat he\u2019s not deadly allergic to, are not comparable to fucking constant diarrhea. \n\nAnd frankly, he shouldn\u2019t even have to deal with the cat. The loud Tv and snoring is just petty, but an allergy? He shouldn\u2019t be expected to deal with that just to see your family. And you shouldn\u2019t be expected to shit your guts out for days, and deal with his over the top freak of a father. \n\nYou need to grow a fucking backbone. Stop visiting his parents. And stop making him visit yours. Visit your parents ALONE. Both of you get sick when at the other\u2019s parent\u2019s home. So stop fucking going. If you want to visit his parents, or want him to visit yours, figure out a way to visit where you do not have to sleep in their home. (Hotel, AirBNB, something)", "Would you blame your boyfriend if he wanted to get an airbnb or hotel while visiting your family so his allergies didn\u2019t get out of control from the cat? \n\nSweetie, this is your health. You\u2019re lucky that the bad food practices have t given you worse conditions at this point. \n\nTolerating things you don\u2019t love for the people you love is not equal to sacrificing your health for the people you love.", "Yes, this is insane. You are both miserable at the other persons home. I vote for just telling everyone that you get sick at their home, but I understand if you are too embarrassed to do that. Not being allowed to flush a toilet is wild to me. You and your BF need to have a come to Jesus meeting about your parents", "You\u2019re letting yourself get sick every time you go to his place, but you\u2019re NOT a doormat?\n\nYou should probably listen to the comments here. We\u2019re more objective than you could ever be. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t get this information out of me with a gun to my head, it\u2019s so embarrassing. To let yourself get diarrhea all the time just to be with a man? For the love of fucking god\u2026\u2026", "Loud TV and snoring are annoying. That's not the same as watching you get hurt and then *scolding you for not hiding it well enough* every visit. Love doesn't look like that. Wake him up or don't, but leave that house now and don't go back until he agrees to defend you better around his family. Don't go back at all if you know it means you'll be sick again.", "Thanks, I didn\u2019t see that comment. Ugh, I wouldn\u2019t go there either! I\u2019m sorry, but no man could be worth knowingly letting yourself get poisoned \ud83e\udd2e", "It's the middle of the fucking night who should she ask?", "So you are suggesting that she tell the in laws that their food gives her diarrhea, is that correct?", "Right they got mad at her for lighting a match, imagine what would happen if she tried to fix their kitchen lmao", "For 1, talk to a doctor.... Has people lost their brains to essential oil?", "what's your suggestion sherlock", "Waking up people to say something and    when people wake up due to burning smell in a  typical American house made of flammable woods  and not saying what you have just burnt few minutes ago ,  are 2 totally different thing.    Mentally mature person will not have any problem in sharing the information.", "Are you OP?", "Exactly!", "Right!!", "Is the middle of the fucking night,  she is having diarrhea for first time?    If she can talk with her mom regarding her problem, why not talk with her mother in law?", "If she is sure of it, then yes tell them.", "It sounds like it's a kitchen problem and not a her problem, she likely doesn't wanna cause issues by bringing it up", "I have no idea, but it is not the reasons she is stating. Is it better to refrigerate food right away, sure. Is it going to hurt you if it\u2019s left out for a while? No.", "Mentally mature PEOPLE (not person) don't have an issue with others going to the toilet. \n\nAlso you can't wake up due to smells. That's why we have smoke alarms.", "Are you OK? Because you don't seem to be.", "Should she wake everyone up to ask if she can use a match? And they already won't fucking fix their kitchen problem please read the fucking comments my god no wonder your comment votes are so low", "Do you actually think the relationship between a person and their mother is the same as between a person and their mother in law? \n\nJust delete your account. You are clearly not fit to talk with other adults yet.", "And how do you think they would react to that?.", "Then why is only she gets affected?   Is others fasting?", "you're bananas and it scares me that you're so sure of yourself based on absolutely nothing but belligerence. why would there be so many rules about these practices and cross contamination issues if this wasn't a risk??? SO many people die of food poisoning that they gave themselves every year.", "Are you suggesting, FIL was waiting awake for OP to go to toilet and burn something?   He know about the match box, without OP telling him..... Nice theory... Any thing else... Lol", "I am just answering in same frequency as you question.", "Not wake up,  but may during dinner or some other time she could have communicated that what remedy she was going to use for the smelly issue.   If people had known, what's going to happen, they may have reacted differently.", "They're all likely used to it. If you eat shit for 18 years your stomach gets used to it, if you only eat it a few times a year your stomach isn't used to it.", "There are entire parts of the world that do not refrigerate almost anything. I\u2019ve traveled and lived in a couple. Have you never left something out overnight?", "Have many people die of food poisoning each year? Tell me.", "What?? \n\nPlease make sense when you comment. \n\nLearning English would be a good start.", "Frequency??\n\n\nDude, just delete your account. You are embarrassing yourself.", "They should just have air freshener in their bathroom at this point tbh", "So you think that during dinner, she should announce \"Hi everyone - I'm going to have diarrhea tonight due to this food. Could everyone let me know what method would be best to mask the smell?\"", "Or she has digestive issues which comes out due to change of place.  Go to doctor for professional diagnosis.   Don't play doctor - doctor with your health.", "no. I have ulcerative colitis and it would kill me.", "https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/index.html\n\nhttps://www.foodsafety.gov/food-poisoning\n\nit sucks that you're using this thread to minimize this for points. foodborne illness is serious and for some people, especially at risk populations, it's fatal. I get that you want to argue with me, but you should focus on getting into law school.", "Good suggestion..tbh", "Go read the comments, it's definitely not her lol. It's the kitchen.", "Please read the comments so you stop looking ignorant. OP addresses this."]}
