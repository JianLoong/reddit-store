My parents had been married for around 20 years. I caught her and told her if she didn't tell my dad I would. Well after screaming at me that I was awful and ruining her marriage it's none of my business she did and it broke my dad's heart. My mom was the center of his universe but he did choose to forgive her.\n\nMy dad passed away almost 3 months ago. He was sick but the passing was very sudden and devastating. I found out through my sister that my mom and Will whose wife also recently passed away were going to the movies with each other. I told both siblings that I was really upset by this because of what I feel are obvious reasons. Sibling told our mom that I knew and was angry but that they weren't. I didn't want to talk to her about it yet because I know that I need time to process between the hurt of my mom's actions and the grief and my husband and I are taking our children on a trip and I want to be able to focus on them as it's been a pretty rough year on us all. But because my mom knows I know she has been pretty passive aggressive with me.\n\nToday I called her and said we need to talk.  The conversation did not go well. My mom has never taken criticism well and when I told her that her actions hurt me and this felt disrespectful to my dad and to us as her kids to go out with Will, especially so soon to our dad's passing. She accused me of not wanting her to have friends- which obviously that was not the issue. There's billions of people on the planet pick literally anyone else. I told her if she wants to continue pursuing a relationship with will she's free to do so but I hate him and will never accept it. I don't want him to be in my family's life. She hung up and then began berating me in text. Accusing me of saying I'm.going to withhold her grandkids from her (I did not) and that how dare I think I know her and her relationship with my dad or anyone else was hers alone and I had no business interfering. I told her multiple times that I loved her and I wasn't going to keep HER from our lives and she could have any other person on the planet in her life. But I don't have to let Will be a part of my life. It dissolves into her saying FU to me and accusing me of gaslighting her.\n\nAm I the AH?

I think it\u2019s fine that you let your mom know that you want nothing to do with him and that you feel disappointed in what\u2019s happening. If you do not want to be around him, you absolutely do not have to be and your mom needed to know that you have that boundary. It doesn\u2019t mean that you and the kids won\u2019t see HER anymore and it doesn\u2019t have to ruin your relationship, although she doesn\u2019t seem like a very rational person. I think she might be reacting the way she is because she does know why you don\u2019t want him to be apart of your life and she probably feels guilt about it. Emotions are high for everyone during a difficult time like this, but I hope it calms down and she can eventually see where you\u2019re coming from and why it\u2019s a reasonable boundary.

It's understandable how hurtful it would be. Your mom's reaction to you is not okay, she can't just berate you because she doesn't agree with what you have to say.", "I guess I\u2019m in the minority here. NTA.

Which technically she is an adult and can do that. But we are not free of the consequences of our actions. I repeated it to her multiple times that I love her and I am not kicking her out of my life but if she continues in a relationship with the man she cheated on my father with then I will not accept him in my life.

You may be the AH by keeping her presence in their lives.  \n\n\nAnd of course, you never have to accept Will even if you decide to keep in contact with mom, but this might be increasingly untenable going forward if the form a relationship.", "I'm not sure what you want from Reddit here. You know your mom is an asshole. You know she cheated and was possibly still cheating. She's not going to do what you want because she doesn't care what you want. Cake eaters never care.

I didn't even read all of this. All I got was that she cheated on your dad x amount of years ago. You caught her. Your dad was broken from it. SOME OF THESE COMMENTS HAVE NO RESPECT saying your TA. Now she's dating the same man after your dad died 3 months ago. That is disgusting.  NTA. I'm pettyish. So best advice just let her date him and when you can just jam them up but be witty about it.", "NTA - but be prepared to have to kick them out when she brings him to the next family event. You may have to go low contact with her for a while. It sounds like your siblings do not understand where you are coming from and may try to pressure you into being around him. Maybe they are more susceptible to her toxicity?\n\n\u201cDear Mom and Siblings,\nFirst I will start this by saying I love Mom. She is an adult and allowed to date whomever she wants. I do not, however, have to have a relationship with this person. I will not have a relationship with the man who I caught Mom cheating on dad with, especially when he has only been dead for 3 months. I ask you to respect my decision as an adult just like I am respecting Mom\u2019s decision to date the man that she almost broke up our family with. If he shows up with Mom to any event I am at, my family and I will leave. My family and I will still be open to a relationship and seeing Mom whenever he is not around. If you lie to me that he will not be there so I will attend and I find out he is present, I will leave. I still want a relationship with all of you, but you need to respect my boundaries.\u201d\n\nI would also think about reaching out to AP over social media as I have a feeling Mom will lie to him about you being ok with him. \n\n\u201cDear AP,\nYou and my mom are both adults and you can date if that is your choice. Despite what my mother may tell you, I will not have a relationship with the man I caught my mother cheating with and who almost broke up my family. If my mother brings you to a holiday event or family gathering, my family and I will leave. If she brings you to my home, you will be asked to leave. I would like myself and my children to continue to have a relationship with my mother, but she needs to respect my boundaries and leave you out of our relationship for that to continue. If she tells you that I have changed my mind and I am comfortable meeting with you, do not believe her. It is a lie unless you hear it directly from me. Any manipulation to try and force a relationship and I will break off contact. What happens from here is up to you and Mom.\u201d", "NTA.  And I would say if she's \"back\" in contact with the affair partner, the odds are good the affair never ended.", "NAH. She is entitled to date whether you like it or not.

Especially after your father passed only 3 months ago.", "I feel like most people are ignoring the most important part of the story. OP is not denying her mom of being in her life she is saying she will not be chummy with the man her mom had an affair with which is fair. OP doesn\u2019t owe than man anything and if she wishes to not allow someone in her space or around her children she has the right. NTA. Mom clearly feels guilty that\u2019s why she\u2019s so defensive over the littlest of things.

I'd be furious. I totally get how you feel.\n\nBut your mom is not cheating on your dad anymore. It's unfortunate that she chose somebody that she has a shady history with, but she's technically not doing anything wrong this time.

Now that your dad is gone they can now stop hiding it", "[deleted]", "You realize that the affair most likely never stopped, right? Frankly, your mom does not sound like a good person. If she wants to carry on with her affair partner publicly as soon as your father is in the ground, that\u2019s her business, but you\u2019re under no obligation to allow her to be a part of you or your children\u2019s lives just because she\u2019s your mom. And if she insists that her and her affair partner are a packaged set, well that just makes the decision easier. NTA.", "YTA, as your anger is ironically misplaced.  You say that your mom can f\\*ck any guy in the world except Will.  That's not fair to your mom.\n\nYour mom made a mistake, cheating on your dad.  But here's the part you miss.  There are about 4 billion men on the planet.  If your mother had not cheated with Will, she still would have cheated on  your father.  She just would have found someone else (other than Will) to have sex with, while she was married to your father.\n\nNow, obviously....Will is wrong for having sex with a married woman.  But if Will had kept his pants on, your mother would have had another penis inside of her, besides your dad's  penis.\n\nIf you're going to be angry at your mom for cheating on your dad, that's fair.  And getting mad at the guy who f\\*cked her while she was married to your dad is also fair.\n\nBut to say they can't be together NOW, just because your dad died suddenly and unexpectedly?  Not fair.  \n\nThe damage was done when your mom opened her legs to a guy she wasn't  married to.  It does not MATTER who the \"other guy\" was.\n\nYou trying to strong-arm your mom into dumping her boyfriend can only be motivated by spite or revenge, at this point.\n\nTwo wrongs do not make a right.\n\nTo be clear:  You want to ghost your mom?  Fair enough, she deserves it.\n\nYou want to be angry at her because of Will, specifically?  Not fair.  Because while Will did participate in the cheating, WILL COULD NOT HAVE STOPPED IT.

She shouldn\u2019t have cheated. She also shouldn\u2019t have had to stay with someone she wasn\u2019t in love with. \nWill has been on the scene for at least ten years.   They clearly have something more than an affair. \nI wonder if she stayed to keep you happy. \n\nYTA - you are sad, you think your mom should be sad too so you making sure of it.", "Mild YTA, bordering on NAH. It makes a lot of sense that you'd have extremely negative feelings about Will and not want him in your life right now. \n\nI don't think your mom did anything wrong developing a relationship shortly after her husband died, even if it is with someone she's previously had an affair with. I think people should be able to grieve however they want, even if it means getting into another relationship quickly.\n\nI don't think you need to accept Will, or be fine with it so soon. Needing more time with it makes sense. But it also seems unfair to your mom to say you will always make it hard for her to be with someone she potentially loves. So maybe you're like, I don't want to see Will for a year. But after that, I hope you would not stop her from pursuing something that makes her happy after her father's death. You never have to like Will, but saying you never want to see him of she marries him or something will obviously put your mother in a very hard situation.

Infidelity and Death are both significant issues that understandably lead to Big Feelings. Having said that, it seems to me that there would be a similar outcome if OP expressed disapproval to her mother about ANYTHING significant.

The specific overlapping elements \u2014 the father\u2019s sudden death, the history of infidelity with the same person, the marital reconciliation premised upon remorse, and the possibility of ongoing deceit \u2014 are so morally monumental that OP can cling to them and hold her ground even in the face of her mother\u2019s reaction.

But here goes.  You say the affair started a decade ago.  That means your mother's marriage to your father ended AT LEAST A DECADE AGO.  Men cheat for sex, women cheat for emotional reasons, as well as sex.  If your mom is having sex with Will, that means that (emotionally) she has left the marriage.  Your father is not entirely blameless.  Don't get me wrong, your mom  is  100% to blame for the affair.  But your father handled the news (of the affair) totally wrong.  He should have\n\n1)  Kicked your mom out of the house immediately\n\n2)  Scheduled a DNA test on all of his supposed children, ASAP\n\n3)  Scheduled a doctor's appointment for himself to be tested for all STD's, ASAP\n\n4)  Hired a lawyer to initiate divorce, immediately.\n\nNear as I can tell, he did none of those things.   However, his failure to respond appropriately does not mean that his marriage wasn't over.  Just that he didn't have the balls to face reality and deal with it appropriately.\n\nYou say your mom hooked up with Will again shortly after your father died?  Nope, that is wrong.\n\nMore likely, your mom and Will never broke up.  They just came out into the open a few months after your father died.  And what they did (cheating) did not damage the marriage, as the marriage ended when your mom decided her emotional needs had to be satisfied outside the marriage.\n\nThink of it this way.  Your mom should have divorced your dad before hooking up with Will about a decade in the past.  That didn't happen.  So your DAD should have divorced your mom about a decade ago.  That also didn't happen. What DID happen, is that your mom emotionally divorced your dad a decade ago, or maybe longer.\n\nWould it have made you feel better if one of your parents had bothered to do the paperwork?
