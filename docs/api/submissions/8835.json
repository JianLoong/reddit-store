Your bro is just envious because he didn't think of the attic idea first.\n\nUnless your brother is in imminent danger of sharing his room with the newborn, you have the better claim -- you're the one who's about to have TWO roommates, one a toddler. \n\nSo that \"deserving\" stuff actually works in your favour -- especially if you're the one who does most of the work fixing up the attic.

Splitting the room and letting the two 16y/o kids have their own space is the best plan though (and by the time the 14, 12s, etc. are coming up hopefully you two will be leaving home and they can 'upgrade' to the single spaces, so it also prevents future disputes by having a progression path!).\n\nAlthough, if they do say no for whatever reason, ~~I'd question why the baby has to share with you and your sister, instead of going in the nursery with the 2y/o. Surely that'd make more sense. If it can't be left around a toddler, or it'd be disruptive to the toddler's sleep, then that's also a good reason why it can't be in a 16y/o's room (your stuff is way less baby proof than a toddler's, and night feeds/changes/crying can't just be cancelled when you have exams and whatnot), so guess baby needs to stay in your parents' room until it is big enough to progress to the nursery.~~ I'm an idiot and lost track of where kids were being stored, sorry. Should still query why the toddler needs to be moved out of the nursery and into somewhere that is unsafe for it (ruining lipstick is annoying when it's an 8y/o, a 2y/o is gonna choke itself on your things!).", "NTA\n\nUh, the parents should keep the new baby in their own room and not make you move in with a toddler. Wtf. That\u2019s just selfish of them imo.\n\nAlso, yes, I think between you and older brother you\u2019d have prio, since living with a small child is worse than living with someone of similar age.", "Maybe they should have the newborn in their room like all the guidelines suggest?

You would be in the only room with 3 people sharing and that is with a 2 year old to bout. if your parents don't want the toddler to share room with a newborn then the newborn should be able to share room with your parents untill the two children can share. The newborns gender shouldent matter untill later in there tween years at witch point some of you older kids have most likely moved out.", "NTA\nIf your brother had wanted his own room, he should have thought of it.

They need to get a bigger house or learn to use protection.\n\nIf the attic is big enough, I would recommend splitting it with your brother, if only to keep the peace. It sucks because you get less space, but it also sucks that he has to \"suffer\" because he didn't think of it first.

The boys in the house are 16(not a twin. We are 11months apart), 14, 13, 12, 12(again not twins), 6, and 6 (not twins). The girls including me are 16, 8, and 2. \n\nMy parents are great parents and have never made me babysit extremely often. My older brother and I just have to watch them once a month so they can have a date night. We don\u2019t mind. The problem I\u2019m having is the bedroom situation. \n\nBedroom one- dubbed the nursery has the 2year old in it currently. \n\nBedroom 2- 16 and 14 year old boys in it\n\nBedroom 3- 13 and older 12year old boys\n\nBedroom 4- 12 and both 6year old boys\n\nBedroom 5- me and the 8year old girl\n\nMy mom is currently pregnant\u2026again. Today she and dad said that 2yr old girl would be moving in with me and the 8yr old. At the time I said ok but then I started thinking. \n\nIt is hard enough keeping an 8yr old out of my things. Then there is the fact that my hobby of building miniature rooms is not exactly toddler safe. Then I had to bring some junk into the attic and it came to me. Our attic is a good size and just needs cosmetic work. If we could sort through the stuff there I could have my own room. \n\nSo I brought it up to my parents, included the reasons why and how I\u2019d do most of the work. My older brother heard me and got angry saying if anyone deserved his own room it was him. I told him that he doesn\u2019t have to make his room toddler proof. \n\nDad yelled at us to stop arguing and that they would think about it for a while. Then they went to do housework and stuff. My brother called me an ass because he should get his own room not me. \n\nAm I the ass for wanting my own room?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lost track of where they were stacking the conveyor belt of little ones lol.\n\nStill should be fine to keep the 2y/o in the nursery, and would potentially be a problem to have it in a room with a 16y/o (I'm sure it doesn't sleep through perfectly all the time and is still perfectly willing to swallow legos and so forth, like pretty much every toddler ever), so seems like an unnecessary and problematic move if the 16y/o must stay in that room for whatever reason.", "Yeah mist that part.

You're going to get a lot of comments about how ridiculous your parents are, if they can't afford kids blah blah, and strong implications that you're being parentified.

You should get it, not your brother, because he's only sharing with one person and you're about to be sharing with two.\n\nYour parents, though. Hats off to them. I have only two kids and I am not parenting this well!"]}
