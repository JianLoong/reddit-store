She had 5 classes but I told her I would handle 3 as she didn't have the money to pay for them all. We agreed on her depositing and then the rest would be sorted by January 5th.

It's a hard lesson in the unenforceability of illegal (at least according to school rules) agreements. If you are at a University in the US, maybe you can get a short-term student loan to get by?", "ESH\n\nDid you really think cheaters would make for honest clientel?\n\nOf course you are going to get ripped off providing dishonest services to dishonest people. \n\nThe main person you are being an asshole to here is yourself. You are risking expulsion for \"easy\" money. Maybe you have convinced yourself that doing this is somehow less stressful than doing honest work but this situation is pretty firm evidence against that. What are you even thinking wanting to drag more people in just to get your money? what are you going to do if they decide they dont like you hounding them and report you?", "ESH. This is what you get in your line of \u201cbusiness\u201d with your clientele. You have zero recourse against her. If you continue scamming schools and screwing classmates (which doing their work for them is doing) for money, make sure you get all payments up front.", "Do you want your morally questionable side business blown up? It's just a matter of time before you get exposed and a good way to piss off people is to start harassing their family and friends. You're \"client\" will get in trouble and so will you. So if your going to do shady things expect to get stiffed by shady people.", "ESH - you shouldn\u2019t be going around tattling to everyone. But you also should have asked for payment up front or payment before handing over the assignments. You gave up your leverage. And since it\u2019s not a legitimate business, you have no leverage now.", "ESH\n\nDude, there is a reason why people say cheaters never prosper. Being kicked out of your uni is a much bigger thing to worry about than not getting paid to help people cheat", "ESH . This isn\u2019t a legitimate job and you certainly shouldn\u2019t be relying on it solely to pay your rent. Messaging people she knows about this is totally inappropriate imo. If she\u2019s blocking you then she knows you\u2019re trying to collect money and is purposely avoiding you. I don\u2019t see how harassing others is going to help. Also you do know you can get into trouble for this right? If someone gets annoyed enough at you harassing them they can get you kicked out of school.", "ESH.

Honestly, you just have to take the l loss here. Hit a pawn shop or something with whatever you have if you\u2019re that desperate.

That is what happens when you operate in this sort of gray area, conducting dishonest business", "ESH For an illegal business, always get your payment upfront. There is no recourse if the person doesn\u2019t pay. You cannot really report her to the university. You will get kicked one of school because what you\u2019re doing is plagiarism. You may want to cut your losses before you end up in a disciplinary action.", "YWBTA to yourself. Your method of making money is morally questionable but if you start chasing other people for her debt, they aren\u2019t going to pay up, they are going to report you for harassment.

This is nothing but a scam artist getting scammed.", "INFO: Are you done with this kind of work?", "At the very least, this is a lesson in terms of how to do business with clients. It was naive of you not to expect some type of partial payment earlier on.

While I think you\u2019re NTA if you did, you shouldn\u2019t reach out more that once, as it\u2019s not other peoples problem and they shouldn\u2019t have to answer for her. Also you should not be relying on something probably illegal (at least against school policy) to pay real expenses like rent. You should instead use the time you would spend doing other peoples assignments to get a real and stable job.\n\nEDIT: you should only reach out to certain people (like her boyfriend). Don\u2019t bring her family into this. Also if you do don\u2019t demand that they intervene and find your money, ask politely if they know if anything is going on and if they don\u2019t want to help then drop it.", "YTA , dubious business your running and if laws like my country that wouldn\u2019t allow debt collectors to harass friends and family you could get in legal trouble plus kicked out of your education institution", "Aw, it sucks.

Multiple unwanted contacts is grounds for stalking/harassment.

It would be great to find a real job", "OP definitely take this person's advice, because I want you to get caught.", "How are you shocked that someone who cheated on an assignment (with your full support and help) is not going to pay for said cheating. They won't pay because they know you can't do anything about it. You can't tell the school because it is likely to get you kicked out of school and the person you cheated for will fail the class. I'm truly sorry you are struggling but you need to see if there is another way for you to earn money without being dependent on cheaters. ESH", "YWBTA. Leave people she knows alone.  It's not their debt.  Threaten to anonymously turn her in, with proof, to the admin for cheating if she doesn't pay.    \nOr write is off as the cost of doing illicit shit.", "So you never had a plan for obtaining payment from difficult clients?\n\nAcademically, what you are doing is very very \u201cillegal.\u201d Expulsion, and permanent mark on your transcripts illegal. \n\nSo for you to not obtain payment upfront ( or half as a down payment and full payment before delivery) is just bad business. \n\nYou either have to let this slide or find another way to get your money from her without risking your own academic standing. \n\nYWBTA if you exposed her in a way that puts your own academic standing at risk. \n\n\nYou should stop doing this, though. Because the fact that you came here to ask if you should basically expose yourself to secure payment is just ass backwards.", "ESH. OP, you can talk to the BF and anyone else who isn't going to get you in trouble to get your money back. You need the money. You did the work, even though it's ethically wrong.\n\nBut, OP, you might want to look for other work. There's a lot of need for people who can write decently on places like Upwork and Fiverr. You could find more legitimate work moving forward.", "eSH but she has more to lose. You could threaten her with telling the school and her sponsorship. You\u2019ll get in trouble too but it sounds like she\u2019ll get kicked out of the country potentially. It becomes a game of consequence chicken.", "You will be caught & expelled. Stop this. No empathy for cheaters not prospering, ESH.", "ESH. You shouldn't be helping people cheat. But you should go scorched earth to get your owed money. Next time, don't deliver a product until you have the money.", "Bud don't do bad stuff for a living unless your ready to be the bad guy to get paid.", "ESH. If you do things that are illegal for money, don't be surprised when you take on some risk about whether or not you get paid. She should pay you, but if you rat her out, she'll rat you out.", "I mean, if that happens OP could just as easily expose her and she would definitely be expelled (or at the very least get zeroes on those 3 courses and lose her sponsorship).", "Doesn't matter what your socials show or not. You did the work, she knows you did the work, the other friends you've done this for know you did the work, you are not anonymous in all of this. All it takes is one of them to go to the school and then you're expelled with marks on your record for any other potential school to see. \n\nGet a normal part time job like everyone else who's trying to pay their way through school does, because doing what you're doing is going to land you in a place where you forfeit all the work/money you've put in up to this point, have no degree, and no chance to get a degree because you've been blackballed as a cheater to all other universities. \n\nAs much as I personally don't care about cheating, universities take it very seriously. Depending on what kind of work you're doing for others there's a chance they could even come after you legally and slap fines or criminal charges on you as well. Nothing about what you're doing is safe.", "lol okay let's be real, this is an ESH situation because your \"job\" is pretty unethical.  but also...if you're gonna be unethical, you gotta be strong and confident as well.  go ahead and contact whomever you need to get your money.  she probably isn't gonna report you for anything, since you could easily just send the school details of her cheating and get her expelled as well.  you've mentioned that her \"sponsorship\" could be affected by her getting a bad grade, which makes me believe that this is a visa type situation and she'd have to leave the country if she were expelled, so it seems like you have the upper hand here.\n\ni'll reiterate that what you're doing is wrong and you should find a better way to supplement your income.  but she also made the choice to engage in this kind of business, so I'd consider you two to be on equal footing with respects to morality/ethics. you both suck, but in a situation where you both bought into this unethical agreement, I'd side with you over the person who's stiffing you.", "That's the point I was making.  She's talking about telling people and it's a bad idea.", "The OP can take solace in that if it blows up in her face."]}
