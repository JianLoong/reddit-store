S and I were really close until she decided to sleep with my (now ex) boyfriend. K knew and supported it but after finding out would claim she is \u201con my side\u201d but her actions never matched that. I was forced to be around S when I kept saying I didn\u2019t want to be. I\u2019ve been told to get over it, forgive and forget, etc. but I can\u2019t help it still bothers me. (I am in therapy btw). I also feel like I was never given the chance to react/grieve in a way that was best for me. Always told to be the bigger person, bite my tongue, etc. Within a week of me knowing K said I was \u201cridiculous\u201d for wanting S to stay at her bf\u2019s for ONE WEEK while I was visiting my dad for spring break. I\u2019ve been called insufferable, a bitch, fat, ugly, etc. by K and her family and every time i\u2019m told to \u201cact like an adult and forgive them\u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve also said things to K and S that were rude. Usually it\u2019s a reaction to them saying something rude to me. \nAlso, Me and K have never really gotten along. K and I got into an argument about a month ago. After, I put my foot down and said I will not be around K or S anymore. \n\nFor father\u2019s day weekend I wanted to come home. My dad has a small boat and camper we keep at a marina/campground that are connected. This is where they spend most time in the summer and I was really looking forward to it because I live in a city three hours away, there\u2019s no where for me to lay by a pool or beach and just relax. I also work a ton so this is probably the only opportunity for me to take a \u201cvacation\u201d home. \n\nS and K decided that specific weekend they want to be at the marina. My dad said him and I can just \u201chang out at the house\u201d. I told him it\u2019s ridiculous because they can go there every single weekend (and they do!) and all i\u2019m asking is one weekend there. He said I can go i\u2019ll just have to be around them. I said No, I told you i\u2019m not doing that. He called me selfish, stubborn, and told me to grow up. That we will have to make up eventually. After hearing this, I told him i\u2019m not going to bother going home and (regretfully) told him to enjoy his new family and that I want no part in it. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if I really am being selfish or stubborn. I feel like for months I let them walk all over me and I finally want to put my foot down but then i\u2019m told i\u2019m ridiculous. I also kinda feel like i\u2019m acting spoiled, but this really will be my only opportunity to relax this summer. so AITA for sticking to a boundary and not coming home for father\u2019s day after the things he said to me?", "created_utc": 1686186099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143usaj/aita_for_not_coming_home_for_fathers_day/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry but your father is an a-hold! I would tell him that he has not been sticking up for you and he is a sorry excuse of a father. Harsh as those words are, he has had many chances to do something and he has not. I would give him one last chance to make it up to you. If he doesn\u2019t, cut him off and let him know not to contact you as you don\u2019t matter in his life, and never have. \n\nYou need to realize he may be your father but you need to look out for yourself and take care of yourself.

(BTW, is she still with your ex?)  Your stepmom completely took her side. And it sounds like your dad just goes along with it because his wife rules the roost, and he doesn't want to have to stand up to her, even for you. No one's held Stepsis accountable. That sucks. I'm sorry. \n\nI'd write him a letter saying all of that. That you're tired of him always siding against you because it's easier to deal with his wife (who, instead of doing the right thing, will always side with her daughter against you). Tell him you didn't come home for father's day because you don't think he's been much of a father lately. \"Father\" is also a verb, not just a noun.", "NTA\n\nIn this family of four, why are you the only one who needs to act like an adult? Go NC", "NTA. You don't have to go to any event. You're an adult. Just do the polite thing and call on fathers day wishing a happy fathers day.", "I'm sorry about what they did but I'm especially sorry about your dad. He's supposed to be the one on your side always and protect you no matter what. NTA, if they were good people they would let you have that time with your dad and if your dad really cared he would tell them that you're coming this weekend and they can stay somewhere else. you deserve respect and they're definitely not giving it to you.", "NTA. It's more than just not liking your sister. She betrayed you, and you are being gaslit into absolving her of responsibility. Your dad, step-mom, and step-family telling you to be the bigger person is, and to bite it, is them encouraging you to let them walk all over you.

Sorry to add to your burden, but did/does your father love/appreciate you at all. You may want some clarification on this because I find it really odd that he would treat you the way he does - ask him pointedly. He seems henpecked to the detriment of his relationship with you. Is he really that weak of a man. Please take care of yourself. Get rid of toxicity in your life. Concentrate on your life without them.

Text him and tell him you hope he is having a good day with his new daughter and to have a good life with her.  Then go no contact for a while.  Maybe then he will wake up and give you some respect.", "NTA- time to go NC with them all!", "NTA for not wanting to be around people that don't respect your feelings. But you are for letting them prevent you from spending time with your father.  You don't have to be at the marina to spend time with him,  he is willing to be with you elsewhere without those two. Your dad will not be around forever and trust me, you will regret not spending as much time as possible together when he is gone. Don't let those two win by putting  a wedge in your relationship with your dad.", "NTA - your step family sucks, and its unfortunate that your dad doesn't seem to understand that. Good news is you learned early that your ex was a jerk.\n\nYou might be an AH if you push this marina thing too much. It depends on how much you want to keep a relationship with your dad. He offered to spend time with you on Father's Day apart from the wicked step family, but you seem to want to make it all about you and your relaxing vacation rather than actually spending time with your dad. In the end its his camper/boat and his choice who he shares it with.", "YTA\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong, K and S are both a-holes and suck in their own way. I highly empathize with you in the situation and am sorry you are going through that. You do sound a bit entitled, though. You say \u201cthey chose this specific weekend,\u201d and if it were some random weekend at the Marina they refuse to give up that would be one thing; however, it is Father\u2019s Day weekend. K is his wife, and I\u2019m not sure the relationship S has with him, but presumably they both want to celebrate with him as well, and therefore you are not entitled to have that specific weekend. I understand the feeling that he is choosing them over you, but he also shouldn\u2019t be forced to make the decision on a weekend meant for him. Unfortunately this weekend falls on what seems to be the only time off you can get, but that responsibility doesn\u2019t need to be put on him. You are valid in wanting to hold that boundary in not wanting to be around them, I\u2019d do the same, but your father gave you a reasonable option to see him instead. I say reasonable because boundaries you put up sometimes come with necessary compromises. To me it sounds like you are more so wanting a \u201cvacation\u201d rather than to spend time with your father and that is where the entitlement comes in.", "YTA. For one thing, father's day isn't about you. For another, your exbf was the one that cheated, not your step sister. Not saying she didn't fuck up, clearly did, but you seem to be misplacing a lot of anger here. For a third point, you don't have a right to exclusive use of the boat and RV. If you don't want to see them it sounds like you still have an option for hanging out with your dad. If you live 3 hours away you can probably ask for a different weekend when they won't be there. Overall though it sounds like they're right and you need to grow up and get over it. You don't need to like them, but figure out how to function when you see them a few times a year. Your dad doesn't seem to have done anything wrong here and you're willing to throw away the relationship for what? Two dumb young people who had inappropriate sex and violated trust?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
