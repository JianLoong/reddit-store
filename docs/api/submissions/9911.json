If he can\u2019t handle to hear people speak about him the way he speaks about women, then he should probably stop talking to women lol\n\nEdit: OP, you being friends with this guy kinda sounds like you deal with some pretty massive internalized misogyny. There are good guys out there that don\u2019t talk like that with anyone. Ditch him", "NTA, and sounds like you need a new friend. If he\u2019s so open about disrespecting, and objectifying fellow women in front of you, I can assure you that he views you as the same.

It doesn't matter if he was super hot or whatever either, that's just a good joke. On top of that he is sitting in a room full of women he supposedly respects... while talking about women like they're objects.

Do you really think he never says this stuff about any of you when you're not around?\n\nHoney, get some self-respect and some new friends.

He said disgusting, horrible, not to mention completely untrue things\u2026sounds like the insult was appropriate.", "Nta don't dish it if you can't take it, and clearly he can't lol", "NTA but you're also kinda t a for still being friends with such a disgusting human being.", "NTA...tit for tat.
