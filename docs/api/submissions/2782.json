They should be proud of you for making the decision you did and instead of making it easier for you to do the right thing, they made it harder. But you did the right thing anyways, I\u2019ll be proud of you if they aren\u2019t\u2026good job, mom!", "NTA.\n\nYou are being a good Mom! Even during the best of times many parents keep new babies away from crowds for the first 3 months.  There are so many nasty bugs going around - you need to stay healthy for your baby. \n\nThat's good to hear your Parents&Grandparents have your back, don't let the others get you down.  You might give your Mom a FaceTime call during the day and you can see/talk to everybody.", "NTA.  One of the most important duties of a parent is to protect their child.  It\u2019s one you can\u2019t shirk or hand off to someone else.  If your relatives really cared about their family, they\u2019d be trying to avoid passing on life-threatening illnesses.", "NTA but your extended family sure is.\n\nThe most important family you have, your priority number one, is in that NICU.  You\u2019re not throwing anything away, instead you\u2019re making your first steps along the lifelong path of motherhood ones that are thoughtful and loving and based on your child\u2019s well-being.\n\nThere will be lots of thanksgivings to spend with extended family.  Your child will only ever have one infancy.  They need you, and you\u2019re making the choices necessary to be there for them safely.\n\nYou\u2019re a terrific Mom.  Here\u2019s hoping your kiddo is out of the NICU soon and toddling happy through that big extended family Thanksgiving next year.", "NTA, what happened last year with a certain virus is reason enough to steer clear, let alone risking Round 2 with a  newborn involved.  Keep you and your baby safe and let the family enjoy tradition and viruses elsewhere.", "NTA - It is very telling that only your extended family are upset by this, because it shows the distance. The distance of how close you are to them and how close to you are with your parents and grandparents. Your parents and gparents care about the health of you and your baby, but the extended family are only concerned with \\*their\\* tradition and \\*their\\* ability to socialize. Remember who says what and keep this in mind with future interactions with them.", "NTA - f\\*ck your extended family", "No, and tell them, point blank, if they want to see their niece/nephew/cousin/grandchild, they will have on a N95 mask or don\u2019t even get out of the car.\n\nStick to your guns, mama.

And that you\u2019re not interested in seeing or speaking to anyone who thinks that could possibly be a bad tradition.\n\nWishing you all the best.", "NTA. For one, you are prioritizing your baby\u2019s health which is what you should be doing. Good on you for doing that, and congrats! Best of luck in parenthood.\n\nSecond, there is always next year and more to come when it comes to family and loved ones. Missing one year of a \u201cfamily tradition\u201d is completely fine- these extended family members act like this is the last family gathering or something.", "NTA. Traditions are an idiot thing. Take care of your baby.", "NTA - not even in the slightest. Your child's savety comes first on the priority list, so you're doing the sensible thing.\n\nIf your extended family can't understand this, then they are selfish ignorant AH's.", "NTA - there will be other thanksgivings and tradition is nice but protecting someone\u2019s life is much more important.", "NTA. You are not the asshole for trying to protect your health and the health of your baby.", "NTA. They\u2019ve shown complete disregard for your sick baby and nothing is worth endangering them. I\u2019m so sorry \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, The opinion of others is not important here at all. You do what is best for your child and that is to avoid contact with others as much as possible.", "NTA. They would find something to be annoyed about anyway, might aswell be this. Try not to care and you do you.", "NTA\n\nI hope your child gets better soon.\n\nYour child is already really sick and you as the mom should be there to go and support your child's recovery healthily.\n\nI really can't understand how your relatives seem to think you'll go for the dinner to \"see family\" when your closest family member( your own baby) is in the NICU.", "NTA. It was a bit irresponsible becoming a mom at 17. But you are proving you are mature and putting your child first. You are NTA, you are not prohibiting anyone from going, you are just choosing not to go yourself. They can keep their tradition and you make sure you are healthy so you can visit your kid. Way to go mommy!", "NTA. At 17 you are one of the most mature people in your family.", "Nta you are smart", "NTA. You\u2019re making the correct decision by choosing to protect your infant that is in intensive care. If your extended family are unable to see that you\u2019re trying to protect your baby from exposure to pathogens that could make them extremely ill, or possibly kill them, then they seem to lack something called common sense. Good on your for making the decision and for your parents and grandparents for supporting with it. I recommend you do your best to pay as little attention to the extended family and keep your parents and grandparents close. And do your best at taking care of your little one and don\u2019t be afraid to reach for help if you need it. Taking care of little ones can be difficult. Keep your head up OP.", "NTA.

He\u2019s doing fairly well but he\u2019s so small and it\u2019s so hard to see him hooked up to all the machines.", "Frankly, I would stay away from extended family even if I didn't have a baby in NICU, given their attitude towards contagions.", "It is a terrifying thing, to have your child be so very small and so very fragile and to have there be so little you, personally, can do to get him through this.\n\nOne of the things you CAN do is make sure you\u2019re not subjecting him to any unnecessary risks.  And you\u2019re doing that by making this decision.\n\nSeriously, you\u2019re the least AH ever to exist. You\u2019re a fantastic Mom, and your kiddo is so lucky to have you.\n\nHang in there and please remember to take care of yourself.  You gave birth a week ago, which is physical and grueling on its own merits, and now you\u2019re going through something terrifying and uncertain.  Don\u2019t be afraid to lean on the people in your life who support and love you.  The better cared for you are, the better you can care for your son.  \u2764\ufe0f", "Your kid is your only priority at the moment, NTA", "I don\u2019t get this. I came from a pretty big family (17+ cousins on one side). I do not ever remember it being a big deal if anyone missed.  With that many, there is ALWAYS someone there to talk to.

Your child will be much better off being adopted than being raised by a teen mom. Don't believe me? Google statistics on teen moms and their kids. You're setting both of you up for failure. Good on you for not risking your child's health and being there for them right now, but in the long term being their mom will do more harm than good.\n\n\n\nGood luck asking your family for help when you can't afford diapers and formula. I hope your child doesn't suffer because of your bad choices.\n\n\n\n\nETA I want to clarify bad choices. Having sex wasn't a bad choice unless you chose to have unprotected sex. Choosing to not abort the child was not a bad choice either, your body your choice. Your bad choice was not putting the child up for adoption. There's no such thing as a good teen mom.", "NTA. Sounds like you have sense and the people that have an issue with you not attending don't have sense.", "NTA", "Omg your family are idiots. Don't worry about them, you're top priority is your brand new family which is your baby!

Good for you, and I hope the baby is released from NICU soon.", "No you have a baby in the NICU, your responsibility is to your baby and any other child in the NICU/health care professional taking care of these sick babies. Take no notice, mother knows best", "NTA you baby always comes first! Your doing a great job! Don\u2019t let others change what you know to be right for your baby!", "NTA. Getting sick means you can\u2019t visit your baby. It\u2019s that simple. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise can f*** off.", "No. NTA. This is not even a question.", "NTA. Baby always comes first.\n\nAlso The Tiny Miracles Foundation (TTMF.org) has some great resources for preemie babies + parents. They may not serve your area directly but they have a lot of virtual options too. It's okay to cry. It's okay to do what you think is right for your baby. It's okay to not meet everyone's expectations because it's impossible to do that.", "NTA. Stay safe and hope your kid gets out of NICU soon."]}
