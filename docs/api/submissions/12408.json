I guarantee you they will not stop your sister from making those \"jokes\" at your wedding, and they'll find a way to dismiss her behavior and make it your fault somehow.

The problem with not inviting them is that your relationship will never be the same again. All the effort they made to get to know your fianc\u00e9 - gone. Then being there for you when you want them, nope, they\u2019ll just remember you kicking them out of your wedding. Now if you don\u2019t want parents, absolutely, go ahead.

Now the move would just to have a small wedding with them not there but you will lose your parents and there\u2019s a really good possibility that all your family will do the same. So, maybe you come up with conditions for your parents and see what they say. Tell them you love your sister, that you love them and if they look after her and make sure she\u2019s on best behaviour, fab, but 1 second of inappropriateness she\u2019s being escorted out.

Should probably uninvite the parents as well.", "Even if the parents do intend to \"keep an eye on\" the sister, they have already shown favouritism towards that sister and negativity towards OP's relationship and wedding. Their idea of what consists of trouble from the sister will already be skewed towards \"it was just a joke\" and \"she meant no harm by it\" and \"it's a wedding, of course she can have a drink or two or three\" and \"you're overreacting OP\". OP can't really trust her parents to keep her sister in line when they clearly have a different idea of where the line is.", "Uninviting all three of them is a good start.

I'm your new twin. \n\nSeriously tho, coming from a homophobic environment trains us to tolerate homophobia for some lil crumbs of love but Duck That. They are being so mean and disrespectful to you.

They didn't go to her and demand that she not drink, appoint somebody to supervise her and bounce her if necessary?\n\ncontrolling your sister isn't anything your parents have any experience of and it sounds like they agree with her to an extent.

And sorry to say but you shouldn't invite your parents either, the fact that they rather saide with bigoted addict before their gay daughter tells you everything you need to know about their priorities, I understand the innate need for their approval but in shouldn't come at the price of your happy day.

I'm not saying this is something you should do, but please do note that you are not alone and that if you need a familial figure there are loads of people who would willingly (and lovingly!) see you get married.   \n\n\nI hope you have a great wedding and I wish you and your future wife the brightest future! <3", "Yup.

Realistically speaking, it is safe to assume that if invited, your sister WILL ruin your wedding, and your parents WILL NOT stop her. It is hard, but maybe it is time to accept that your parents will choose her no matter what. You are starting your own family now, look forward to your future with your wife.", "NTA, and stop settling for scraps. They don't actually support you, they literally view you as less than, why on Earth would you want to have homophobes ACTIVITY undermining your relationship at your wedding? That is just going to cause more pain and stress to you and your fiance. I say uninvite all 3 of them just so you won't have that worry/stress that they would make a scene or say something cruel to your fiance or you, because there is a high chance of that happening.
