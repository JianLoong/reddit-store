I guarantee you they will not stop your sister from making those \"jokes\" at your wedding, and they'll find a way to dismiss her behavior and make it your fault somehow.

The problem with not inviting them is that your relationship will never be the same again. All the effort they made to get to know your fianc\u00e9 - gone. Then being there for you when you want them, nope, they\u2019ll just remember you kicking them out of your wedding. Now if you don\u2019t want parents, absolutely, go ahead.

Now the move would just to have a small wedding with them not there but you will lose your parents and there\u2019s a really good possibility that all your family will do the same. So, maybe you come up with conditions for your parents and see what they say. Tell them you love your sister, that you love them and if they look after her and make sure she\u2019s on best behaviour, fab, but 1 second of inappropriateness she\u2019s being escorted out.

You can\u2019t trust her.", "NTA but you are underreacting. I would not invite them. You are clinging to false hopes and their support is only in your head.", "Jesus, you deserve so much better than these people in your life.  But they've torn you down so much, you don't even see it.\n\nI dislike how often this sub jumps to extreme advice like divorce/dumping, but I genuinely hope you'll consider going no contact with all three of these people.  They DO NOT support you, and you gain nothing by keeping them in your life.", "Hey, I know you want your parents there, but life is always gonna turn out better when you cut off all the toxic people. The headache that your parents and sister brings out will only increase and I want you to not deal with all that. Cut them off, you're getting married to a wonderful woman and you're gonna be happy without them. NTA", "INFO \n\nDid you show them the speech your sister wanted to give\n\nDid you relate your conversation to your parents?", "NTA - the fact that they put wedding in quotes says they don\u2019t support the wedding or YOU.      \nThem being there doesn\u2019t equal support.       \nYou\u2019re better off having none of them there.", "NTA\n\nIf she can't find it in herself to respect you, your marriage and your partner, why on Earth would you want her there?\n\nStart your marriage on a sane basis, one of respect for your partner and yourself. That's the most important thing. Your sister and parents can choose to meet you there, or they can fuck off", "NTA. Should probably uninvite the parents as well.", "Even if the parents do intend to \"keep an eye on\" the sister, they have already shown favouritism towards that sister and negativity towards OP's relationship and wedding. Their idea of what consists of trouble from the sister will already be skewed towards \"it was just a joke\" and \"she meant no harm by it\" and \"it's a wedding, of course she can have a drink or two or three\" and \"you're overreacting OP\". OP can't really trust her parents to keep her sister in line when they clearly have a different idea of where the line is.", "Uninviting all three of them is a good start. But I hope OP realizes it's probably time to uninvite them from her life. They're all truly awful,\n\nNTA", "NTA, close the door on all that toxicity and have a beautiful wedding celebrating your love for each other", "Duck alla them. I'm your new twin. \n\nSeriously tho, coming from a homophobic environment trains us to tolerate homophobia for some lil crumbs of love but Duck That. They are being so mean and disrespectful to you. Congratulations on your awesome partnership and I'm sending you all my best gay wishes for a future so bright with love that you couldn't even conceive of wanting someone around who would be so disrespectful to you.", "NTA. Your sister is a homophobe and your parents are too. Dress it up how you want, but that's the bottom line.\n\nYour parents are humouring you in going along with the wedding, but deep down they think it's not real like your sister does.\n\nDon't have these people anywhere near your special day! You deserve to be around people who celebrate your marriage and not those who think you are \"playing\" at weddings.", "NTA - its a shame she put you in that position and your parents supported her but she is clearly not somebody who is going to be celebrating your wedding.  They didn't go to her and demand that she not drink, appoint somebody to supervise her and bounce her if necessary?\n\ncontrolling your sister isn't anything your parents have any experience of and it sounds like they agree with her to an extent.  They might feel what she says needed to be said, right there.  Are your parents looking for an excuse?", "NTA, but why would you want a bunch of homophobes there that are 100% going to pull some shit and ruin your day? Im sorry family or not you need to know when enoughs enough.", "Your sister has dragged her whole family down with drink and drug abuse but you're the one who's ruining your parents' live for... *checks notes*... being gay? Wow. Just wow. NTA. Marry the girl. Divorce your family.", "NTA. Omg. Schroedingers wedding. It's a BIG deal to the sister and parents if they can't go. But it's a wedding in quotes if they do go? Awful. Good riddance. \n\nBe surrounded by the people who show up in your lives to love and support you on your celebration of love as you formally become family with your bride.", "NTA. Your wedding will be better without these toxic people. The only AH bit is that you invited them at all knowing they don't respect you ot your partner. Don't do that to yourself or your bride. Have a happy fay surrounded by the people who love you!", "NTA. And sorry to say but you shouldn't invite your parents either, the fact that they rather saide with bigoted addict before their gay daughter tells you everything you need to know about their priorities, I understand the innate need for their approval but in shouldn't come at the price of your happy day. Uninvited them if this is the hill the want to die in, you deserve not only respect for you and your fiance but their love. Please think of yourself and don't bend on this.", "Tagging onto the top comment in the hope OP sees this. \n\nOP, I don't know if you are aware but there is a FB group called \"Stand In Pride\", which has both a base in the US and in Europe (and internationally as well). \n\nIn this group, people offer to stand in as your mother, father, aunt, uncle, sister whatever you desire. I'm not saying this is something you should do, but please do note that you are not alone and that if you need a familial figure there are loads of people who would willingly (and lovingly!) see you get married.   \n\n\nI hope you have a great wedding and I wish you and your future wife the brightest future! <3", "Yup. OP, call their bluff - and be elated if they aren\u2019t bluffing.\nNTA.", "No kidding. \"Well, since none of you consider this to be a real wedding, I don't have to consider this to be a real family. So you can all just fuck off, I'll go have my real wedding with my real family.\"", "Good kick controlling a drunk when there\u2019s alcohol.  Also as an alcoholic, even if it was a dry wedding she\u2019d bring alcohol, she can\u2019t go without it now, she\u2019s go into withdrawals which isn\u2019t safe.  Do not allow her at the wedding, she will ruin the day.", "(Goes to look up this group to maybe join. I would love to support people on what should be one of the happiest and most love-filled days of their lives.)"]}
