Over the last year I\u2019d say we began speaking again and aren\u2019t super close but it\u2019s better. \n\nThe last time we spoke was about 2 years ago when she revealed to my entire family that I was gay. It was at a dinner and she got completely trashed and said it without thinking and made more comments voicing her negative her negative opinions on the topic. My parents spoke and both cried like I ruined their lives which is another story but they\u2019ve somewhat accepted that I won\u2019t change. Which I can\u2019t say about my sister. \n\nI have been with my fianc\u00e9 F26 for about 4 years and we\u2019re planning on getting married early spring.

I\u2019m not having a traditional MOH wedding party it\u2019s more just my close friends m & f supporting me and helping but nothing too strict. My sister didn\u2019t want to be involved so I didn\u2019t involve her but we both agreed for her to have a speech.\n\nWe were sitting down drafting some ideas when she said is it ok if I put some jokes in it. I hesitated but said sure write them and I\u2019ll look over them. When I read what she wrote I immediately told her no jokes: all she wrote was rude comments toward my fianc\u00e9 and the majority of it was homophobic and saying shit like \u201cit\u2019s not a real wedding in Gods eyes so who cares\u201d. I then told her explicitly to not comment on my relationship at all during the wedding. \n\nShe argues that ofc she\u2019s gonna voice her opinion bc she can\u2019t control honesty when she\u2019s drunk. I then say you\u2019re not drinking then, I told her if she will not be respectful she doesn\u2019t have to go. If she wants to go to humiliate me and my fianc\u00e9 I don\u2019t want her there. She then goes you can\u2019t expect me to be quiet I mean you\u2019re marrying a woman. The convo continued until I ultimately uninvited her. Now my parents are saying I\u2019m being an AH and they won\u2019t go either bc they aren\u2019t going to support my actions if my sister isn\u2019t going to be included. They say they will keep an eye on her but uninviting my twin sister to my \u201cwedding\u201d they put it in quotes is fucked up and I should be ashamed. I want my parents there bc I do want their support even if they aren\u2019t 100% they have shown effort in getting to know my fianc\u00e9 but I don\u2019t trust my sister and if I don\u2019t invite her they said they won\u2019t go.

She is being rude and disrespectful. And if your parents side with her, I\u2019m sorry, but good riddance to bad rubbish. You\u2019ll have your true family around you, all of your friends that love you deeply and want to see you happy. Congratulations on your day.

I would tell them not to threaten you with a good time, stick to your guns, and let the people who truly care for you show up.", "NTA.  Do not invite your homophobic alcoholic sister who does not respect you.  Don't invite your parents either.  Make sure security is aware so they will be escorted out and not ruin your wedding.", "NTA\nI've learned the hard way people show their true colors and go a bit wild at weddings. So i just want to start off by saying I'm so sorry, and i understand how upsetting it is to have family treat you this way leading up to the happiest day of your life. \nYou are NTA\nSometimes you have to do what makes you happy and protects you from harm. It's your wedding. Your happiness is all that matters. So if that means someone can't be there because they will jeopardize your happiness, so f*$ing be it. Let alone someone who is saying horrendous things. The people who stand up and show up for you will, because they care. \n\nHang in there and I'm so sorry you are going through this.", "There is no gentle way to say this. I would not invite any of them to your wedding. Yes, this is terrible. Yes, you are likely the one most hurt by this. However you deserve a day to experience joy with your fianc\u00e9 without your family shitting on it. \nI\u2019m sorry they are like this. I hope it gets better. However your sister sounds toxic and your parents enable her behavior by supporting her. \nI\u2019m glad your parents are trying and I hope they open up their minds more in the future.", "NTA.

Can you patents honestly expect to contain her? NTA.", "NTA, uninvite them all. You don\u2019t need their negativity on such a special day.", "NTA. But she is. Your wedding should be a celebration of you and your soon to be spouse, with people who genuinely care about you and your happiness.

I\u2019m sorry she sucks.", "You are 100000% NTA -- your sister absolutely shouldn't be invited even if she \"apologizes\" or promises to behave because based on this post, it's pretty clear that she's not going to. Don't let her homophobic bullshit ruin what should be the happiest day of your life. And if your parents are siding with her, then good riddance to them, too. There's absolutely 0 excuse for being a bigot in this day and time when information is so absurdly easy to access so you can educate yourself.", "NTA and honestly, go ahead and uninvite your \"parents\" too before they can act like it's a power move to refuse attendance themselves. If they're also in the boat that your marriage isn't a true union, then they don't deserve to participate in one of your best days either. Only those who actually care about you and actually want happiness for your relationship and your future should be there. It's clear that your parents aren't those people. \n\nIt must be so incredibly hard to consider that and accept that. I am so sorry. You do have a real relationship and a real wedding coming up. Just like your sister has a real drug addiction and is together with a man 10 years her senior and somehow that's better in these (for lack of a better word) freaks' eyes than you being in a good place in life and marrying a good person who looks after you. \n\nIf your parent's aren't 100% then they are not 100%. If your parents think it's better to have a drug addicted daughter together with a man 10 years her senior than it is to have a gay daughter building a solid and happy life for herself, then that is THEIR loss NOT yours. I guarantee you they will not stop your sister from making those \"jokes\" at your wedding, and they'll find a way to dismiss her behavior and make it your fault somehow. Just because they're biological family doesn't mean they should have the opportunity to scorn your happiness, especially on this major day in your life.", "NTA and whishing you the best. Don't bring toxic people - you just need people who love you and respect you around for this day", "NTA - its your weeding and moment.  Regardless of who believes what.  You are going to celebrate the union of two people. \n\nDo I believe in that kind of marriage? What the does matter? It doesn't.  None of what I think matters.  \n\nAt the end of the day you have to come to you own person with your own beliefs.  You have undoubtedly struggle and slayed inner demons to become who you are today. \n\nIf she doesn't support or believe in your marriage, then why go? Worse, is she is under the assumption that making a speech will change anyone's heart.", "Your parents should be ashamed at how they treat you.  They'd rather support the  alcoholic homophobe, which is fucked up. Wish you the best for your wonderful day without drama from those that do not fully support you and your STBW.

Weddings are about the couple and whatever is important to them and brings them joy", "I said it was going to be unpopular.  But in marriages two families get joined together.  Both sides get a new mother and father and siblings.  And they inherit the responsibility of caring for the well being of them and being cared for by them.  Both families become one larger family due to the union of these two individuals.  Yes, the couple's happiness is important, but the marriage is larger than just them. Everything about the wedding ceremony is there to show this.", "That is very dependent on the individual culture. This is not true everywhere in the world", "Yes, the culture that this wedding is taking place in."]}
