I guarantee you they will not stop your sister from making those \"jokes\" at your wedding, and they'll find a way to dismiss her behavior and make it your fault somehow.

The problem with not inviting them is that your relationship will never be the same again. All the effort they made to get to know your fianc\u00e9 - gone. Then being there for you when you want them, nope, they\u2019ll just remember you kicking them out of your wedding. Now if you don\u2019t want parents, absolutely, go ahead. But parents quite often are all about family and all being included hence why they offered to keep an eye of the sister. Now the move would just to have a small wedding with them not there but you will lose your parents and there\u2019s a really good possibility that all your family will do the same. So, maybe you come up with conditions for your parents and see what they say. Tell them you love your sister, that you love them and if they look after her and make sure she\u2019s on best behaviour, fab, but 1 second of inappropriateness she\u2019s being escorted out.

They clearly don\u2019t actually support you either if they are siding with your openly disrespectful sister over you or referring to your wedding as a \u201cwedding\u201d.
