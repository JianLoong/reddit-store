Me and my three friends have booked a boys trip down the beach because a few of our other friends will be down there. Well one of our friends invited his girlfriend (let\u2019s call her J) without telling any of us till 3 days before the trip. She hangs with us a lot and we\u2019re all sweet with her coming however the issue is we booked a house with 3 beds, a king and two singles. Me and J are quite close, J is texting me at the moment saying her and her partner will take the king and they\u2019ll bring a blow mattress for the person who doesn\u2019t get a single. This is where my question comes in, I told her that we would all put our names in a hat and whoever gets picked first gets first pick off beds and so on and till last person takes the blow up . She has gotten very angry at me saying because she\u2019s a women and in couple she deserves the king bed with her partner. I understand this point, but she wasn\u2019t originally invited to this trip and no one wants to sleep on a blow up mattress. So am I the asshole for telling her she can\u2019t claim the king bed?\n\nUpdate: thanks everyone for the comments and appreciate all the advice. Things took a dramatic turn and my friend and J got into a massive fight about this and they now have broken up.

Hate when friends try to opt their partner in for friend group events at the last second without checking if it would be cool with others.\n\nJust because a couple is now coming doesn't mean they're not automatically entitled to the king bed - by that logic, you could've also invited a partner, or hell, an escort even, and been entitled for consideration towards the king bed.

It is a little bit odd because if the couple\u2019s on the blow up that means only one person is in the King room.

It has nothing to do with OP.", ">Why raffle otherwise?\n\nBecause no one wants the blow up mattress! And there could be other factors such as each room's amenities or views.\n\nFurthermore, you skipped over the main point of that segment entirely. In the case of a dispute, like there is now, a raffle gives everyone fair odds whereby the couple had very significant chances to get what they want anyway.\n\n>if the couple\u2019s on the blow up\n\nIt would be \"a little bit odd\" regardless! The alternative is that someone who paid 25% of the house fees sleeps on his last choice while the couple who paid 25% for two people (i.e. half what the guy on the blow up did each) gets a premium experience.\n\nThe couple doesn't even have to stick together, by the way. One can get a single bed while the other can be in the blow up.\n\nWhy is it just a given that everyone needs to accommodate their desire to have loud obnoxious sex on a group vacation? Having to bend to group consensus is one of the conditions one accepts when one forces their way into a group activity.\n\nAnyway, do read OP's update at the bottom of his post.
