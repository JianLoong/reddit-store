Three year olds can be carried on hikes, sat with adults on horseback, and taken almost anywhere.

It was wrong of you to assume a nature resort vacation would just be adults since you know your cousin has a child, and if you wanted an adults-only trip you should've communicated that from the beginning. If they try to use you and your spouse as childcare options on this trip, then you can set that boundary if/when it happens, but overall this just sounds like poor planning and setting uncommunicated expectations.", "NTA  for having concerns with your cousins bringing his toddler along on the vacation you thought was a couples vacation. \n\nStrong chance you're dream activities will turn into child friendly ones instead. Children that age get bored quickly - they haven't developed long attention spans, she still a toddler.\n\nChances are the vacation and activities OP has envisioned and planned may very likely be derailed. The cousin  may have the best intentions and think they can do everything with their 3 yr old and nothing needs to be changed.  You may end up doing things with your wife while they do things with their child.

Tell him what your vision/expectations for the vacation are and that the vacation also includes his wife to come along on every activity, not being left behind to care for his daughter. Maybe the resort has a childcare service.\n\nThen ask what your cousin had envisioned this vacation to be like with his daughter along. And how caring for her would look like and entail. Maybe he's thought this through and maybe he hasn't.    \n\nAll of you have a discussion that needs to take place.

The car will be more crowded (not just the additional person, but 3 year olds need more stuff), it takes longer to get 5 people moving (especially a 3 year old), and the entire trip will likely become child-centered as she can't be left alone and isn't able to keep herself entertained for long periods of time.", "YTA - you assume that it his 3 year old will be a burden to you, when maybe your cousin will go hiking and his wife will watch her and trade off on the other activities. It's extremely presumptuous of you to insist on them being away from their kid at that age.\n\nI mean, honestly I don't think I would ask someone with a 3 year old to go on such a venture anyway. Did you even discuss this with them before booking it, or did you just book and say, \"You need to leave your daughter with your mother or MIL\"? I think you think you were being nice, but to me that sounds like a-holish behavior. You can suggest such things, but you shouldn't have insisted on them.", "Are there separate roo.s you are paying for? Or will the reservation for 4 turn Into a 5? Does cousin expect you all to be quiet during naps and early bedtime if you are sharing a suite? \n\nI'm sorry but it sounds like cousin is just going to get a free family vacation from you, while doing child friendly activities instead of activities with you.", "NAH. But you need to keep in mind that lots of people take toddlers and even babies to nature activities, and it goes wonderful for everyone, children, parents and other group members alike. So probably for your cousin it also was obvious that his kid goes by default.\n\nYou totally N A for not wanting a kid there, but don't presume to know better that your cousin if his kid is up to it or not. Don't make decisions for him, just don't change the activities you want if your cousin can't do them because of a kid. You'll probably still have quite a number of things to do together.\n\nAlso, there actually is a big difference between not seeing your kid for a week (and grannies might not even want to take her in) and leaving her in a resort's daycare for a few hours during activities, so again, don't assume they won't want to leave her there since they don't want to leave her at home.

I\u2019m suspecting Bro has figured that \u201cone of the girls\u201d can keep the tot if activities get too arduous.", "This is not necessarily true. I have memories from when I was three, especially the things like family trips have stayed with me. This very much depends on the kid. Some have better memory than others.", "Uh, I was just using an example that was in the post.. yes, they can get on a horse with a parent.", "I guess OP should have communicated that because the cousin appears to have other y", "For OP it is but it appears the cousin doesn\u2019t think so", "It is subjective, which I\u2019ve concluded after several discussions here in this thread. I\u2019m in my mid 20\u2019s and most of my friends don\u2019t have kids. Our friends always inform us when they\u2019re bringing their kids. We don\u2019t have to tell them that kids aren\u2019t welcome because they ask. \n\nMy main point is that assuming other childfree people know you\u2019re bringing a toddler to an event with ONLY childfree people is unrealistic. However, as I say, I\u2019m in a friendship group where most don\u2019t have kids and those who DO have kids, have young kids (under 5) who require near constant attention and often massively affect the atmosphere of the day/evening/weekend/whatever. \n\nBut my parent friends understand that we don\u2019t naturally assume the toddler is going to be there. A lot of people aren\u2019t realising that when I say this, I don\u2019t mean that we usually say \u201cno\u201d. Most of the time we say of course! Bring the kid. But the point is that they tell US. \n\nI think that also because of our ages, most of us are still enjoying the novelty of adult life and not spending time around younger siblings/kids etc. \n\nI expect that as we get older and more of us have kids, the expectation will change. But the types of plans we will make will also change.\n\nMany parents find that they slowly drift away from their childfree friends, and this is often a contributing factor - parents assuming that their toddler is always welcome.", "This event isn\u2019t with only/mostly child free people though, this is a holiday between two couples, one of which has a kid. That\u2019s 50% of the group that is not child free. Which is why it was silly for either couple to make assumptions and not just have an actual discussion about their expectations. (Although I do lean more towards expecting that a parent would bring their child unless otherwise specified rather than the reverse, and I\u2019m also mid 20s with the majority of my friends still being unmarried and child free.)"]}
