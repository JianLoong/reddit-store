Clearly the two of you have different ideas about the goal of the vacation.\n\nNAH. Cancel the reservation.", "INFO Why can't you and your wife do activities without the other couple and their child? It would really be a shame to spend all your time at a resort and miss the chance to go horseback riding in Mongolia (a dream of mine!)  or hiking but if they stay back to mind their daughter, you should still be able to do those things.", "INFO:\n\nHave you discussed the activities you wish to do at the resort with your cousin?\n\nWhy did you assume he wouldn't want or expect to bring his child?\n\nHow long have you booked the resort for?  Is it for the weekend? Longer?  In other words, how long are you asking/expecting one of the 3 year olds grandmother to look after her for.", "Sounds like you assumed they wouldn't bring their child with them on holiday.  \n\nYTA for assuming.", "You can ask, but YTA for telling him what to do.  It is his choice.  You could simply state your position as \"I am not a babysistter.\"", "NAH - there\u2019s not enough context to call him an AH. But I would let him know what you plan on doing on this trip. If he brings the kid, still do it and if he cant join in thats on him.", "NTA. Just set a boundary that you are not changing your plans to accommodate a child and do not give in.", "Seems like this is an unpopular opinion, but YTA. Three year olds can be carried on hikes, sat with adults on horseback, and taken almost anywhere. It sounds like he loves his kid and wants to include her in additional activities that deviate from their day-to-day life, which is honestly awesome to see. It was wrong of you to assume a nature resort vacation would just be adults since you know your cousin has a child, and if you wanted an adults-only trip you should've communicated that from the beginning. If they try to use you and your spouse as childcare options on this trip, then you can set that boundary if/when it happens, but overall this just sounds like poor planning and setting uncommunicated expectations.", "NTA  for having concerns with your cousins bringing his toddler along on the vacation you thought was a couples vacation. \n\nStrong chance you're dream activities will turn into child friendly ones instead. Children that age get bored quickly - they haven't developed long attention spans, she still a toddler.\n\nChances are the vacation and activities OP has envisioned and planned may very likely be derailed. The cousin  may have the best intentions and think they can do everything with their 3 yr old and nothing needs to be changed.  You may end up doing things with your wife while they do things with their child. Basically different vacations at the same location or you'll be doing activities they want. \n\nThe exception is if the 3 yr old is already accustomed to traveling long distances etc.  Something to discuss with cousin and his wife.\n\nIf sharing a suite you may very likely be woken up by the 3 yr old since they tend to be early risers.\n\nI suggest you talk to your cousin and explain all of your concerns - even babysitting that you don't want to do. Tell him what your vision/expectations for the vacation are and that the vacation also includes his wife to come along on every activity, not being left behind to care for his daughter. Maybe the resort has a childcare service.\n\nThen ask what your cousin had envisioned this vacation to be like with his daughter along. And how caring for her would look like and entail. Maybe he's thought this through and maybe he hasn't.    \n\nAll of you have a discussion that needs to take place. You have agreements and compromises that need to be made so everyone has a good experience. Including the wives.\n\nEdit to add first paragraph.", "Did you discuss this before making the reservation? \n\nNTA for mentioning that you thought it would be just the 4 of you and your goals for the trip, but you'll need to accept his answer. You can then decide if you still want to go or not.  Personally, I would back out and let them pay for the entire reservation. The car will be more crowded (not just the additional person, but 3 year olds need more stuff), it takes longer to get 5 people moving (especially a 3 year old), and the entire trip will likely become child-centered as she can't be left alone and isn't able to keep herself entertained for long periods of time.", "YTA - you assume that it his 3 year old will be a burden to you, when maybe your cousin will go hiking and his wife will watch her and trade off on the other activities. It's extremely presumptuous of you to insist on them being away from their kid at that age.\n\nI mean, honestly I don't think I would ask someone with a 3 year old to go on such a venture anyway. Did you even discuss this with them before booking it, or did you just book and say, \"You need to leave your daughter with your mother or MIL\"? I think you think you were being nice, but to me that sounds like a-holish behavior. You can suggest such things, but you shouldn't have insisted on them.", "Are there separate roo.s you are paying for? Or will the reservation for 4 turn Into a 5? Does cousin expect you all to be quiet during naps and early bedtime if you are sharing a suite? \n\nI'm sorry but it sounds like cousin is just going to get a free family vacation from you, while doing child friendly activities instead of activities with you.", "NAH. But you need to keep in mind that lots of people take toddlers and even babies to nature activities, and it goes wonderful for everyone, children, parents and other group members alike. So probably for your cousin it also was obvious that his kid goes by default.\n\nYou totally N A for not wanting a kid there, but don't presume to know better that your cousin if his kid is up to it or not. Don't make decisions for him, just don't change the activities you want if your cousin can't do them because of a kid. You'll probably still have quite a number of things to do together.\n\nAlso, there actually is a big difference between not seeing your kid for a week (and grannies might not even want to take her in) and leaving her in a resort's daycare for a few hours during activities, so again, don't assume they won't want to leave her there since they don't want to leave her at home. It's not the same thing!\n\nOverall, as you already seem to agree, there needs to be more talking and less assuming, but no one is an asshole, everyone is somewhat bad in communication, and having a kid there might not be as bad as you seem to assume))", "NTA. You should be firm that you and your wife are going to do the said activities. They can choose whether to join you or stay and watch the 3 year old, but you are not going to stay in or do easy hikes just because he wants to bring his toddler to the mix.", "NTA.\n\nOP had no reason to expect that his friend would bring a three-year-old on a looooong road trip there and back and various physical activities suitable only for adults.\n\nHis friend should have said, right from the start, I'll come with my toddler. It wasn't OP's job to  anticipate it. What else didn't he think to ask? Are you bringing your dog? A chicken?\n\nThis is ridiculous behavior on the part of the friend. If you have a child, life will revolve around the child...for you and your spouse. Not for anybody else. \n\nKeep your child at home or daycare.", "YTA; if they don\u2019t want to leave the kid with someone else (understandable for a variety of reasons) they either can\u2019t go at all or they bring the kid with them\n\nIt\u2019s called being a parent", "YTA, my kid never ruined a hike when i carried her and she hasent ruined a kayak trip when we used a double. It definitely doesn't ruin them now that she can paddle her own.  But i get it, some people cant stand kids. Next time tell him that brobeans.", "NTA, (as it is ultimately up to your cousin) but this should have been thought of and considered before making reservations.  If you wanted to do those activities you should have been upfront with you cousin when the trip was discussed that your expectation was that this would be an adults only trip and his child was to be left with his mother.  Your cousin may have not decided to go, if he decides not to go now he will probably lose money.\n\nBut if your cousin cancels and loses money you need to pay him back as this is your fault.", "You have no right to tell him what to do, what you DO have the right to do is inform him that the rest of you will be following through with whatever activities you already had planned, and that if the toddler has to miss out due to the type of activity, it is your cousin's responsibility to figure something alternate out for him and his kiddo.
