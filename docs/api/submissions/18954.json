Three year olds can be carried on hikes, sat with adults on horseback, and taken almost anywhere. It sounds like he loves his kid and wants to include her in additional activities that deviate from their day-to-day life, which is honestly awesome to see. It was wrong of you to assume a nature resort vacation would just be adults since you know your cousin has a child, and if you wanted an adults-only trip you should've communicated that from the beginning. If they try to use you and your spouse as childcare options on this trip, then you can set that boundary if/when it happens, but overall this just sounds like poor planning and setting uncommunicated expectations.", "NTA  for having concerns with your cousins bringing his toddler along on the vacation you thought was a couples vacation. \n\nStrong chance you're dream activities will turn into child friendly ones instead. Children that age get bored quickly - they haven't developed long attention spans, she still a toddler.\n\nChances are the vacation and activities OP has envisioned and planned may very likely be derailed. The cousin  may have the best intentions and think they can do everything with their 3 yr old and nothing needs to be changed.  You may end up doing things with your wife while they do things with their child. Basically different vacations at the same location or you'll be doing activities they want. \n\nThe exception is if the 3 yr old is already accustomed to traveling long distances etc.  Something to discuss with cousin and his wife.\n\nIf sharing a suite you may very likely be woken up by the 3 yr old since they tend to be early risers.\n\nI suggest you talk to your cousin and explain all of your concerns - even babysitting that you don't want to do. Tell him what your vision/expectations for the vacation are and that the vacation also includes his wife to come along on every activity, not being left behind to care for his daughter. Maybe the resort has a childcare service.\n\nThen ask what your cousin had envisioned this vacation to be like with his daughter along. And how caring for her would look like and entail. Maybe he's thought this through and maybe he hasn't.    \n\nAll of you have a discussion that needs to take place.

You can then decide if you still want to go or not.  Personally, I would back out and let them pay for the entire reservation. The car will be more crowded (not just the additional person, but 3 year olds need more stuff), it takes longer to get 5 people moving (especially a 3 year old), and the entire trip will likely become child-centered as she can't be left alone and isn't able to keep herself entertained for long periods of time.", "YTA - you assume that it his 3 year old will be a burden to you, when maybe your cousin will go hiking and his wife will watch her and trade off on the other activities. It's extremely presumptuous of you to insist on them being away from their kid at that age.\n\nI mean, honestly I don't think I would ask someone with a 3 year old to go on such a venture anyway. Did you even discuss this with them before booking it, or did you just book and say, \"You need to leave your daughter with your mother or MIL\"? I think you think you were being nice, but to me that sounds like a-holish behavior. You can suggest such things, but you shouldn't have insisted on them.", "Are there separate roo.s you are paying for? Or will the reservation for 4 turn Into a 5? Does cousin expect you all to be quiet during naps and early bedtime if you are sharing a suite? \n\nI'm sorry but it sounds like cousin is just going to get a free family vacation from you, while doing child friendly activities instead of activities with you.", "NAH. But you need to keep in mind that lots of people take toddlers and even babies to nature activities, and it goes wonderful for everyone, children, parents and other group members alike. So probably for your cousin it also was obvious that his kid goes by default.\n\nYou totally N A for not wanting a kid there, but don't presume to know better that your cousin if his kid is up to it or not. Don't make decisions for him, just don't change the activities you want if your cousin can't do them because of a kid. You'll probably still have quite a number of things to do together.\n\nAlso, there actually is a big difference between not seeing your kid for a week (and grannies might not even want to take her in) and leaving her in a resort's daycare for a few hours during activities, so again, don't assume they won't want to leave her there since they don't want to leave her at home. It's not the same thing!\n\nOverall, as you already seem to agree, there needs to be more talking and less assuming, but no one is an asshole, everyone is somewhat bad in communication, and having a kid there might not be as bad as you seem to assume))", "NTA.

It wasn't OP's job to  anticipate it. What else didn't he think to ask? Are you bringing your dog? A chicken?\n\nThis is ridiculous behavior on the part of the friend.
