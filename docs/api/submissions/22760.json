I moved to a different city after my undergrad so we stopped seeing each other all the time. \n\nWhen she got engaged I was very happy for her. She always wanted a husband and kids. I will take one if one comes along but I'm in no hurry.  \n\nI made sure to RSVP as soon as I got my invitation. I flew in for her bridal shower and bachelorette party. I couldn't be part of the bridal party because I am rather busy with school and work. \n\nI was planning on giving an envelope with cash as a gift because nothing on the registry suited me. I know it's a gift for them but I wouldn't give an air fryer as a gift at a stranger's wedding. \n\nWe were talking last week about the wedding and she basically said that since I couldn't make the effort to be a bridesmaid I better be getting her something big off the registry.  \n\nI said I wasn't planning on it. She got really upset and said I may as well not show up if all I'm going to do is disrespect her. \n\nSo I decided to just not go. I cancelled my flight and hotel and I'm going to have a staycation in my city instead. It will probably cost me less. \n\nMy mom called me this morning to double check when they were picking me up at the hotel. I told her I wasn't going and why. She said I was being petty and that the wedding wasn't about me. I said I understood that but I won't have my actions dictated by anyone.  \n\nIt's a pretty big wedding and I don't think I'll be missed but my mom keeps calling me and begging me to change my mind. I think that she's afraid it will reflect badly on her if I don't show up. \n\nNope\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689867201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154u85n/aita_for_bailing_on_a_family_wedding/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is trying to persuade you to do something that you don't want to do because she doesn't want to feel any shame over it. Your mother brought you up (hopefully) to be your own strong woman to make your own decisions.\n\nSo, forget about your mother.\n\nI fully support you not going. Your cousin sounds like a piece of work, while you, behind the scenes have been doing everything you can to make things nice for her.\n\nI'm full of admiration for you that you were able to see all of this for yourself and that you cancelled your plans. This means you put yourself above being badly treated. That's a really good thing.\n\nDon't doubt that now. Don't think for one minute that your decision was wrong.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nIt was a triumph.\n\nTell your mother that she raised you well to make your own informed decisions after taking all the facts into [consideration.

But even then, it is your right to decide for yourself whether or not you want to go.", "NTA. I\u2019ll chalk up your cousin\u2019s comments/reactions to disappointment and stress associated with the upcoming wedding, but asking guests to provide elaborate gifts on top of travel for weddings and/or make time commitments that aren\u2019t realistic are unrealistic expectations. Weddings are meant to be a celebration and frankly she turned it into something else based on your comments. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be part of a bridal party if someone wasn\u2019t respectful of my time/feelings.", "NTA, you have made a decision, you plan to stick by it. With all the cost you would have incurred this sounds like the right move. Oh I am sure it will be noticed that you are not there, it is a family wedding.", "NTA. You weren't disrespecting your cousin by opting to give cash instead of a gift from their registry. Cash is always a good option for wedding and baby gifts.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like your cousin even cared to have an idea what you were planning on. All that seems to have mattered was that it wasn't \"a big gift from the registry\". Which is a pretty bad attitude to have.\n\nHer reasoning for why she expected this was even worse. The whole \"not making the effort to be a bridesmaid\" thing. It may not be who she is normally, but right now she sounds very self-centered and shallow.\n\nThe upside of this is that you're doing exactly what your cousin told you she wanted. For you to not show up.\n\nI doubt that's what she was expecting. She probably thought that by saying it, she could browbeat you into buying one of the big gifts on her registry.\n\nBut it's what you're doing, and if anyone ever asks why you didn't go you can just say \"My cousin told me to not show up\". And just leave it at that. You could explain more, if you really wanted, but you don't have to.\n\nSide-note, not sure if you were planning to send the gift cash or not. But this is a small opportunity to \"be the bigger person\" in a way that is (imo) in line with what it is really supposed to mean.\n\nDrop that gift and a nice card in an envelope and mail it off. Oh, and be sure to add a nice note to it. Something like \"I'm sorry that you didn't want me to show up to your wedding, but I thought I would still send you the gift I was planning.\"\n\nDoes she deserve it? Probably not. But, if this is not who she really is, the gift and the note may help her to realize her poor behavior here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
