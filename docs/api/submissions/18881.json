I lived there for 3 years, paid for the internet bill, took care of my nephews, who were 2 and 3 at the time, and did the lawn care. I had met my now husband during this time, who had basically moved in with us afterwards for about a year before we bought our house. He took over lawn care, did general maintenance around the house, helped me care for my nephews, helped with the groceries etc. all while my sister worked, and paid the other bills. When we moved out, my sister had had her boyfriend of a few months move in and I assumed everybody would be okay, bills were getting paid, and my nephews were getting taken care of. \n\nAfter my wedding in 2022, my sister messaged me and said she, her boyfriend, and my two nephews needed to move in bc they were getting evicted. She had told me the entire time I lived with her, she was always behind on a bill/rent and her landlord was finally over it and kicked them out. Now, had she told me she was behind on anything when we lived together, OBVIOUSLY I would\u2019ve helped her. Every time I asked if she was okay, if there was anyway I could help her financially, she said she was fine, or if she asked for money, I\u2019d send it to her. \n\nI told her we didn\u2019t have the room for them. Our house is small, beside a busy road, and we have two giant Saint Bernards that my nephews are afraid of and have a tendency to run away if they get out of the fence gate. We are very protective over them and our cats bc we don\u2019t have kids of our own, and would be devastated if anything happened to them. Our spare bedroom isn\u2019t big enough for 4 extra people living in it, along with all their stuff. She lived in a 3 bedroom apartment with a finished attic that I lived it. We don\u2019t even have room to host more than 2 extra people bc our house is so small. I calmly tried to explain this to her, just to have her call me a bitch, selfish etc. Mind you, she also quit her job, as the suggestion of her boyfriend, who is also jobless, to do doordash/Uber, and get her Etsy shop up and running, with no backup plan if that didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI, and the rest of my family have given her several other options to try and help, but she was dead set on just living with me and my husband for an undetermined amount of time. Had it been just her and my nephews, it would\u2019ve been fine. But I\u2019m also not a fan of her boyfriend, who is a bum. Sometimes I still feel like just giving in for the sake of my nephews, but I have boundaries that. Feel like she\u2019s not respecting, and just wants to play a victims bc we\u2019re not throwing money at her to get her back on her feet.\n\nAdditionally: her boyfriend, after we moved out, had his sister, her kids, his kids, his grandkid, all move in. And NOBODY contributed. There were upwards of maybe 12 people living in their house after we left.", "created_utc": 1685816766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zl43t/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_move_in_with_me/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't a grifter or bum when you lived with her. Childcare is expensive AF and you did that plus some bills and the lawn care. So if she's suggesting that you didn't contribute when you lived with her and you coasted, that's a lie. If that was an issue at the time, it was her job to bring it up. Obviously you didn't know she was struggling so how is any of that your fault?\n\nYou also made valid reasons why this won't work. The biggest reasons being I don't think you would ever be able to evict them and they won't contribute anything. They are gig workers and want to make money on Etsy. Both can happen but if for 1+ year they haven't been able to stay afloat on their own and make rent payments, what's to say they're even trying and aren't just looking to mooch?\n\nIf you have the finances to comfortably do so, you can offer her some money to stay afloat and beg the landlord to keep them. Also, people are giving her options, she just doesn't like them and is deadset on your home.", "NTA the circumstances of you staying with her are very different to her circumstances. You have no room to take in four people. It\u2019s not that you and the family haven\u2019t offered support and options, she just doesn\u2019t want to stick to them. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong.", "NTA. I get it, you want to help family but space is a commodity and there are times when there isn't enough to go around. Why does it \\*have\\* to be you, given there are other options on the table?\n\nI am perplexed as to why she thought it was a good idea to quit her job if she was already struggling with rent/bills - something you had volunteered to help out with - at the behest of her unemployed boyfriend, who sounds like a freeloader.", "NTA, dont let your boundaries be crossed by guilt tripping.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you, you\u2019ve already acknowledged you don\u2019t have the space and their not working. You will be stuck with them for years. How long before they start telling you to get rid of the dogs because the children are scared and you need to prioritise the kids over dogs? Do not allow this.", "NTA.  She clearly had boundaries and terms set for when you lived with her, but she can\u2019t respect that in turn?", "NTA  \nShe has been given options for help, but she's set on coming to live with you? Yeah, she did let you live with her rent-free, but the house you and your husband bought is too small for 4 extra people...", "NTA. Nannies get paid as well as get free housing. If you let her move in, she'll never leave.", "Info: how long ago did you move out? Also was the new boyfriend helping her financially or no? I feel like it\u2019s suspicious that as soon as this guy shows up she gets evicted.", "What ended up happening to them? Do they live in their car?", "NTA. You literally don't have the space to put her. Never mind that both her & her boyfriend were totally irresponsible with their finances. She has other options. Your sister is an adult & you are not her keeper. Don't give in. \n\nYou would never get rid of her once they got in the door. Never mind having to support the whole family because the adults are deadbeats. Circling back to...where the hell would you even put them in your small house.", "NTA she has numerous options but wants to live with you to get free childcare and lawn service again", "NTA", "NTA, Don't be guilted, she isn't wanting to help herself.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to bring her boyfriend into your house.", "NTA. I feel like you \"paid\" for living with your sister by providing child care, lawn care etc. That made you even at this point. Aside from the logistics of her entire family moving into your home, it's unfair for her to call you selfish when you provided services for your previous living situation.", "NTA - however: she let you live there rent free for 3 years. Is it possible for you to take in your nephews, so they can have some stability in their life? Or set a boundary of your sister and nephews but not the boyfriend?", "YTA.  She let you live with her for 3 YEARS RENT FREE so you could save up for your own place.   She let your now husband live there rent free for A YEAR. Now the two of you can't be bothered to help her out for any period of time?  I get saying the boyfriend can't move in.  He had nothing to do with helping you, but your sister?  That's cold.", "You lived there for 3 years and clearly didn't pay your share of expenses.  I understand not wanting them to live with you (6 people in a space you got for 2 people is overwhelming).  Perhaps you could help her out with some money instead.  She's family and even if you don't like her boyfriend, she does.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course, he's conveniently skipping over the value of the live-in daycare, free lawncare, groceries, maintenance from bf the year he lived there, etc. That's why nothing else will do...", "We bought our home January of 2021. She got evicted December of 2022. He apparently took over making sure the bills were paid. She told me at the time this was very good for her mental health bc she didn\u2019t have to worry about them and could focus on her and her boys.", "They\u2019re with a friend as far as I know.", "I offered that but she didn\u2019t want to do it. It was either all four of them or nothing. Obviously I don\u2019t want my nephews being homeless. Everyone keeps saying my sister \u201chas to hit rock bottom\u201d before realizing she\u2019s just screwing her life up staying with her boyfriend. But at the expense of my nephews livelihood, I don\u2019t like.", "Rent free in exchange for taking care of her nephews. And doing other chores.", "Agree.", "Sister got three years of FREE child care, lawn work and one year of FREE maintenance work out of the deal. And OP would let her and the nephews move in but not the bum boyfriend. Sister doesn't want that.", ">clearly didn't pay your share of expenses.\n\nDo you know how expensive childcare is? Lawn services?", "Like I said, my entire family gave her other options. She just doesn\u2019t want to accept them. My dad has plenty of space for them, but she refuses. I also offered to have just her and my nephews, but her boyfriend was not part of that deal bc I wasn\u2019t going to have someone who refused to get a job live in my home. \n\nAlso, this man is known for stealing. I would never feel comfortable with him in the house. But she won\u2019t separate from him.", "Ahhh yeah I\u2019d dig deeper if I were you cause it sounds like he screwed her over somehow. You\u2019re definitely not the reason she got evicted. I think the fact that she\u2019s blaming you and trying to guilt you into letting them all stay with you for an unknown amount of time is all reason to put your foot down and say no.", "Your point?  Mine is that OP and partner were given a total of 4 years to get themselves financially stable.  They won't even give sister back 1 night.", "Yes, I've paid for both.  It sounds like she moved in with her sister and was justifying why it was okay.  I'm sure she did help out with those things, but is that the REASON she moved in and was it at the request of her sister?  I sense that it wasn't."]}
