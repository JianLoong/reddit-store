I lived there for 3 years, paid for the internet bill, took care of my nephews, who were 2 and 3 at the time, and did the lawn care. I had met my now husband during this time, who had basically moved in with us afterwards for about a year before we bought our house. He took over lawn care, did general maintenance around the house, helped me care for my nephews, helped with the groceries etc. all while my sister worked, and paid the other bills. When we moved out, my sister had had her boyfriend of a few months move in and I assumed everybody would be okay, bills were getting paid, and my nephews were getting taken care of. \n\nAfter my wedding in 2022, my sister messaged me and said she, her boyfriend, and my two nephews needed to move in bc they were getting evicted. She had told me the entire time I lived with her, she was always behind on a bill/rent and her landlord was finally over it and kicked them out. Now, had she told me she was behind on anything when we lived together, OBVIOUSLY I would\u2019ve helped her. Every time I asked if she was okay, if there was anyway I could help her financially, she said she was fine, or if she asked for money, I\u2019d send it to her. \n\nI told her we didn\u2019t have the room for them. Our house is small, beside a busy road, and we have two giant Saint Bernards that my nephews are afraid of and have a tendency to run away if they get out of the fence gate. We are very protective over them and our cats bc we don\u2019t have kids of our own, and would be devastated if anything happened to them. Our spare bedroom isn\u2019t big enough for 4 extra people living in it, along with all their stuff. She lived in a 3 bedroom apartment with a finished attic that I lived it. We don\u2019t even have room to host more than 2 extra people bc our house is so small. I calmly tried to explain this to her, just to have her call me a bitch, selfish etc. Mind you, she also quit her job, as the suggestion of her boyfriend, who is also jobless, to do doordash/Uber, and get her Etsy shop up and running, with no backup plan if that didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI, and the rest of my family have given her several other options to try and help, but she was dead set on just living with me and my husband for an undetermined amount of time. Had it been just her and my nephews, it would\u2019ve been fine. But I\u2019m also not a fan of her boyfriend, who is a bum. Sometimes I still feel like just giving in for the sake of my nephews, but I have boundaries that. Feel like she\u2019s not respecting, and just wants to play a victims bc we\u2019re not throwing money at her to get her back on her feet.\n\nAdditionally: her boyfriend, after we moved out, had his sister, her kids, his kids, his grandkid, all move in. And NOBODY contributed. There were upwards of maybe 12 people living in their house after we left.\n\nEdit: since people are unaware what helping with my nephews meant, I picked them up and dropped them off at daycare during the week so i could go to my every day job. Made breakfast and dinner. Helped buy clothes. Helped with bedtime. Basically was their 2nd parent since the father was hardly in the picture. The only things I didn\u2019t do was take them to doctors appointments.", "created_utc": 1685816766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zl43t/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_move_in_with_me/", "score": 839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't a grifter or bum when you lived with her. Childcare is expensive AF and you did that plus some bills and the lawn care.

Obviously you didn't know she was struggling so how is any of that your fault?\n\nYou also made valid reasons why this won't work. The biggest reasons being I don't think you would ever be able to evict them and they won't contribute anything. They are gig workers and want to make money on Etsy. Both can happen but if for 1+ year they haven't been able to stay afloat on their own and make rent payments, what's to say they're even trying and aren't just looking to mooch?\n\nIf you have the finances to comfortably do so, you can offer her some money to stay afloat and beg the landlord to keep them.

You literally don't have the space to put her. Never mind that both her & her boyfriend were totally irresponsible with their finances. She has other options.

She let you live with her for 3 YEARS RENT FREE so you could save up for your own place.   She let your now husband live there rent free for A YEAR.
