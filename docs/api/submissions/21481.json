He wanted me to have the house because of all his children I have the worst chance at a decent life and will likely have to quit working before I'm 50. My mother at the time shot him down and said its unfair on the other 3 kids and it shouldn't go to one child.\n\nNow here we are, my sister is on the will for owning the house and she'll get a \u00a3300k+ countryside house for a \u00a3120k mortgage which is basically for nothing, and her partner owns his own home in a local town. \n\nAre we the assholes for being upset that we get 40k each while my sister who's partner owns a home and is a year away from being fully paid gets our family home instead of selling the house and splitting it 4 ways? \n\nAlso sister and her boyfriend are self employed and bankrupt, working for cash in hand mainly, very little through their accounts. This will likely result in no bank giving them a \u00a3120k mortgage which they have 3 years to obtain, and nothing written in the will stipulating the repercussions if unable to obtain the mortgage.\n\nMy mother feels she has done right by us, and can't understand why we aren't taking it well and just brushes off the fact that a year before she signed the will to my sister she told me that it would be unfair for me to get the house despite being disabled and having no partner who already owns a home, I'm renting at \u00a3650 a month and my other 2 brothers both have their own homes and paying a mortgage, so it's especially hurtful to me even though I wouldn't want the house and would prefer a even split.\n\nThanks folks :)", "created_utc": 1688650550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s9g4f/aita_for_being_upset_about_myself_and_my_two/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here are my takeaways:\n\n* Mom heavily favors sister for whatever reason. \n* Sister appears manipulative and will stop at nothing to have her way\n* Parents allowed sister to buy out the house for almost a highway robbery price, there is already a home in her immediate home life, looks almost like a vacation home for your sister.\n* Your dad was correct in trying to will the house to you. Your disability/ies should've taken priority in this instance. No one likes pain olympics but I'm sure your brothers would've been okay with that.\n\n120k for that home was a sweet deal and it should've been yours given the circumstances imo. \n\nI would tell your sister to enjoy her new vacation home and go NC if this is her behavior in your father's death. If she is bankrupt and pulling fast ones like this she might just turn up one day asking for help. Or not, since she'll probably sell that house at a premium before it gets that bad.\n\nI'm kinda actually a little bit mad on your behalf here tbh. I'd also consider my relationship with my mother if I was you, OP. I don't want to add to the grit here, I know you're feeling a lot of feelings, but I think it's highly offensive that she said it was 'unfair' for you to have the home and dole that shit right out to someone else, with the exact same terms you were offered.", "OK. Your dad died. Your mom is still living, and is presumably living in the house in question. Your mom intends to live in this house until she dies.\n\nIt would be normal for your mom to inherit some or all of the house from your dad.\n\nBut this sounds a bit like a default intestacy split.

It is possible that there is a will stating otherwise, but absent of this, your mother can do whatever she wants with her assets. We did not inherit anything when my FIL passed since my MIL is living. She got everything (and rightfully so!).\n\nI think it is reasonable to feel the situation is unfair, but your Mother could have given you nothing. She could, in fact, make a will that leaves everything to charity or an unrelated party. I think you should be grateful for the 40k.", "NTA I thought stuff like houses had to be divided based on market value?", "NAH\n\nThere are always sentimental values put on \"things\" when distributing assets of a family member and no one can tell you how to feel about that.  From a financial consideration it looks relatively equal.  You claim house is worth 300k but has a 120k mortgage, so that's 180k equity.  There are 4 siblings (you, 2 brothers and sister).  Divide that equally and each sibling would have an interest of 45k.  You and each brother got 40k from the estate and your sister received no cash.  Maybe not fair to the cent, but close.  You point out your sister can't re-finance the mortgage within 3 years, but it also shows that you have no desire have the house yourself.  \n\nThere is no easy solution and it seems that the division was close to equal so I vote NAH.  If you want, meet with your siblings and see if you can all agree on something else.", "NTA. Clearly your older sister is getting favorable treatment and your mother is obviously a hypocrite.

Unfortunately, your mother now gets to decide what to do with all of the assets that belong to her since your father\u2019s passing. Did your father leave a will? Unless he left the house to you at the time of his passing, it probably went to your mother, who now controls everything.", "Whilst you can't force someone to show you a will, maybe it will be worth asking your mum if you can see it so you can understand what your dads perspective was when the outcome is so drastically different from what your dad told you he wanted. \n\nI also don't understand why your mum is so happy to favour your sister. Is it some misguided thing of \"eldest gets the largest chunk\"? I know the Irish half of my family used to do something similar when it came to distributing inheritance and wills etc (though my family are from Kiltimagh, Mayo) so idk if there's a difference from Eire to NI, a legit tradition or if my family are just odd. \n\nHope you're okay. Inheritance stuff is often shitty to manage", "ESH. \n\nYou can have feelings but the fact is you aren't entitled to anything unless it was written into a will. And, fair isn't always equal.", "YTA.

As an older woman she would not qualify for a loan to pay off inherited debt but she has an inflexible set amount of time (usually 6 to 12 months) to settle the deceased\u2019s debt before they foreclose on the family home.  It\u2019s possible your financially secure sister has offered your Mom a way out of your father\u2019s debt by giving her the money she needs to pay off your father\u2019s debts in exchange for the house.\n\nThat would mean your mom is giving you each $40,000 leaving very little or nothing for herself just to preserve your father\u2019s memory for her children.   I\u2019m betting this possibility never crossed your mind but it is sadly a very common occurrence.  As I said I have seen this first hand several times and every time it was a shock as the deceased husband gave everyone the impression his widow would be financially secure when in reality he had next to nothing and many unknown debts.\n\nYou absolutely have the right to feel upset but the reality is that you are going by what your father said 3 years ago not the actual facts.  I suggest calling a family meeting and directly but very gently ask your mom what kind of debt your father left her to pay off.  Watch her immediate reaction closely as the truth will be in her face those first few seconds before she recovers her composure and verbally responds.  Then you\u2019ll know the direction the family discussion needs to take.  Best of luck.", "You need to see father\u2019s will.

The sister now owns the asset outright because she was given 12.5% by the father and 50% by the mother, for free.

What is the mother getting? Or is the mother living in the house with the daughter? Or is the sister giving mum 40k too?\n\nAlso in Ireland, the spouse gets priority over children, so mum would probably be entitled to the house before children.
