R is from a foreign country. We are in R\u2019s home country visiting friends and family. Main language in this country is not English. \n\nA little background. We planned to meet R and her friends, who are partnerless and childless, for dinner. We have 2 kids, 2 and 6, and they were to stay with grandpa, uncle and aunt. \n\n2 year old is finding it difficult to be away from us and cries alot but family member don\u2019t care and are ok with it. My wife is not. 6 year old is fine because he can watch iPad or whatever. \n\nThe original plan is no kids at the dinner to meet friends. However, because 2 is having trouble, she is going to go. I\u2019m not happy, but whatever. I know I will have to play babysitter while my wife socializes. 6 year old will stay with family. \n\nWe get ready to leave and say good by to 6. 6 says he doesn\u2019t want to go. We ask why he says he doesn\u2019t. Long story short, he is going now to. \n\nI\u2019m not happy at all but again, whatever. I\u2019m already on babysitter duty so what is one more. As I\u2019m driving I feel a massive headache coming on but think I\u2019ll be able to survive. \n\nWe arrived at friends and we start eating dinner. 6 is not hungry and wants to sleep. Friend brings out a beanie bag for him to sleep in. He ends up playing on it and not sleeping. I\u2019m constantly telling him to knock it off and lay down. He does, for lil but then is back at it.\n\n2 is fine but after she is full, it is terrible 2s. About an hour after arriving, it is time to go. The kids are bad. I can\u2019t join the conversation and I decide to let my wife stay and talk and I\u2019ll take the kids home. \n\nI drive home, 25 min drive and it is bad. Headache is a full on brain splitter. Kids are loud and being siblings and I\u2019m trying to navigate home in the hell hole of driving that exists in this country.\n\nI finally get home, get kids to bed and take medicine. I text wife we are home, safe and going to bed. I mention because of the chaos of tonight, I\u2019m not going to the zoo with everyone tomorrow. I want to stay home and relax. \n\nWe had already planned this adventure. We would be leaving early, 6am and be out in the sun, in insane humidity. Wife would not be alone and would have help with the kids. \n\nIn not so many words, she called me an AH for not going to the zoo.

Why not leave the kids with the (willing) relatives and go as a couple.\n\nThis is a trip mostly for your wife to see dear people, I think being a good sport and supporting her is the way to go, not show her you don't care about her family enough to pull yourself back a bit for the trip.", "NTA - You had a bad headache. It's completely understandable that you want some peace and quiet. That being said, the other comments are right in the fact that you should change your attitude toward parenting.", "It depends on why you brought 2 to dinner. It sounds like everyone was okay with leaving her at home except your wife? So your wife is forcing you to deal with the baby so she can socialize with her friends? I\u2019m a believer that vacations are special, but it sounds like your wife made the kids come so you wouldn\u2019t be able to join in her conversation with get friends.", "YTA Your evening doesn't even sound that bad.

You had babysitters for the kids, and yet you chose to bring the kids for dinner (you\u2019re in charge as parents and they did not have to come). Now you\u2019re bailing on an already planned outing because you had a bad evening.\n\nMight want to fix your attitude a bit.", "Yta. \u201c2 is going with us, I\u2019m not happy but whatever I know I will have to play babysitter\u201d \nYou\u2019re a father grow up. It\u2019s not babysitting your kids, it\u2019s called parenting. It\u2019s not always the mother\u2019s responsibility to be the only parent, while you call your time parenting \u201cbabysitting.\u201d Headache aside, bc mothers get headaches too, it\u2019s pretty shitty of you to act like it was unfair that you didn\u2019t get to be apart of the conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s a joke that you need a full day to recover and relax after having a headache while being a parent for a dinner. Have you ever considered the hardships your wife endures while parenting, she doesn\u2019t ask for a full day off. You\u2019re a father. Suck it up, and go make memories with your kids. Don\u2019t leave your wife to single parent bc you can\u2019t handle it.", "It sounds like vacationing with kids. Not fun. \n\nIf you need down day because you had a migraine... that\u2019s totally understandable.

This moment isn\u2019t the time to be trying to have fun yourself, it\u2019s a time to focus on what she needs. There will be other times in your marriage when your own needs will take center stage. \n\nOn the other hand, when you\u2019ve had a hard night, if there is a way for you to get some time off from the childcare role, that\u2019s also worthwhile. So it\u2019s reasonable for you to let her know that you really need some down time, and ask if it would be OK with her for you to stay home during the zoo trip. So that\u2019s a time for discussion, for helping her to understand that you\u2019re really struggling. Not a time for just saying that you\u2019re not going. \n\nHaving young children is a really hard season of life. \n\nSo, YTA, because you need to adjust your attitude about supporting your wife during this trip and actually talk things over with her rather than just saying how things are going to be.

That means things can be annoying sometimes. Raising a kid is a job for two people. If you do not want that, you should not have had Kids. \n\nHowever, what is this about headaches? You have them Regularly? Are you diagnosed with something? If they are that bad, maybe you have an undiagnosed medical condition. Maybe go to a Doktor.", "INFO: Why did you feel the need to bring the kids to the dinner in the first place?

You don't need to be one yet. Also, as others have pointed out, you're not babysitting. You're parenting. YTA", "YTA - you don't \"babysit\" your own children. You want to \"stay home and relax,\" so that you don't have to deal with the heat and humidity and the children, but it's okay that your wife and others do so in your place.", "INFO: you had arranged a babysitter, so why didn't the sitter come and babysit the kids? You could have joined the convo and the sitter could have kept the kids near you so that they can cpme and meet you when they need to.\n\nCurrently the problem appears to be that you chose to babysit and now you are in a bad mood because you had to babysit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
