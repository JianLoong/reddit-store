R is from a foreign country. We are in R\u2019s home country visiting friends and family. Main language in this country is not English. \n\nA little background. We planned to meet R and her friends, who are partnerless and childless, for dinner. We have 2 kids, 2 and 6, and they were to stay with grandpa, uncle and aunt. \n\n2 year old is finding it difficult to be away from us and cries alot but family member don\u2019t care and are ok with it. My wife is not. 6 year old is fine because he can watch iPad or whatever. \n\nThe original plan is no kids at the dinner to meet friends. However, because 2 is having trouble, she is going to go. I\u2019m not happy, but whatever. I know I will have to play babysitter while my wife socializes. 6 year old will stay with family. \n\nWe get ready to leave and say good by to 6. 6 says he doesn\u2019t want to go. We ask why he says he doesn\u2019t. Long story short, he is going now to. \n\nI\u2019m not happy at all but again, whatever. I\u2019m already on babysitter duty so what is one more. As I\u2019m driving I feel a massive headache coming on but think I\u2019ll be able to survive. \n\nWe arrived at friends and we start eating dinner. 6 is not hungry and wants to sleep. Friend brings out a beanie bag for him to sleep in. He ends up playing on it and not sleeping. I\u2019m constantly telling him to knock it off and lay down. He does, for lil but then is back at it.\n\n2 is fine but after she is full, it is terrible 2s. About an hour after arriving, it is time to go. The kids are bad. I can\u2019t join the conversation and I decide to let my wife stay and talk and I\u2019ll take the kids home. \n\nI drive home, 25 min drive and it is bad. Headache is a full on brain splitter. Kids are loud and being siblings and I\u2019m trying to navigate home in the hell hole of driving that exists in this country.\n\nI finally get home, get kids to bed and take medicine. I text wife we are home, safe and going to bed. I mention because of the chaos of tonight, I\u2019m not going to the zoo with everyone tomorrow. I want to stay home and relax. \n\nWe had already planned this adventure. We would be leaving early, 6am and be out in the sun, in insane humidity. Wife would not be alone and would have help with the kids. \n\nIn not so many words, she called me an AH for not going to the zoo. So, am I?\n\nEdit 1: so, I thank everyone for replying. Indeed, there is some resentment for watching the kids this evening. My wife didn\u2019t want to go herself even though I suggested I stay back with the kids. She didn\u2019t want to force 6 to stay with family even though all he would have done is watch tv/ be spoiled by family members. I know there would be  nothing for them to do at the house we were at. We gave an iPad to the kids and it is rare when they both can watch something together. We tried it at the house and it was a day when both wanted something different. \n\nHousing in this country is apartment based and very, very small. There was no taking someone to help watch the kids as that would put them right in the middle of everything. The house was 3 rooms. A bedroom and bathroom, kitchen and living area and a computer/office room. The kids had to be in the living area. \n\nI used the word babysitting because that is what it was. I have no problem parenting and spend more time with the kids than my wife does. However, we were not at our home. We did not have access to the toys/entertainment we have at home. We were in a foreign country, in a small apartment that is not child friendly. I had to constantly watch both kids to make sure they didn\u2019t break or ruin something.\n\nEdit 2: so, again, I thank everyone for responding. It is interesting how some people understand the use of babysitting and some don\u2019t. But, that is fine. \n\nMy wife has enjoyed reading the comments about how I am a horrible father and everything in between. She only has to say, \u201cstay mad\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ll keep responding to comments here and there but for the most part, I know where this lies on Reddit. \n\nIATAH for using babysitting instead of parenting. \n\nIANTAH for not wanting to go to the zoo due to a headache. Although there are a few who said otherwise. \n\nOn a final note, the vacation was overall great and we had a great time visiting several cities, meeting a few other group of friends and experiencing a culture and lifestyle outside of the U.S.\n\nFinal edit: for those that care, my wife wanted to point out a few things based off some of the comments we have read. \n\nThe beanbag was apparently really expensive so host brought it out for 6 to sleep on, since he said he was tired. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any headache symptoms the next day but the medicine I take for the headaches, Excedrin makes it very difficult to fall asleep as it wakes me up but it is quick acting and generally gives relieve in 30 mins. So while the headache was gone, I know it would be tired and operating on little sleep for an all day adventure. \n\nFor everyone saying I suck as a parent because I can\u2019t keep my kids entertained, my wife struggles too and is wondering if she is a shitty mom as well. She had a difficult time on the airplane with1  while I was able to have a relatively smooth experience with the other. \n\nPerhaps this is the last update. We shall see.

When you're in another country and you arrange for a babysitter, your life while it is to take care of your children, people are allowed to take a break from their kids. Also taking care of kids at home is vastly different than when outside of the country. \n- .\n\n- The mother insisted on bringing the kids along when the father didn't. Unless the mother had concerns with her own *family member* taking care of her child then she should have said, I don't feel X is safe with Y without us. If there was no safety issue then she brought along her kids and expected the husband to babysit while she caught up with her friends, which was fine. OP just couldn't make the event the day after. And if the children are being too difficult to handle, OP dealt with it and didn't even blame the kids, they chalked it up to kid things. Everyone in Reddit expects parents to be 100% perfect 100% of the time and to be able to handle any situation when sometimes kids do things you've never seen before or behaved in a way that was new\n- .\n\n\n- I get that you all are saying when visiting your partners home you should be taking a backseat and allowing them to prioritize reconnecting with their relations, but I thought its rather unfair to expect that. It was very evident OP shared a true interest in meeting partners family and that is not common, and to be honest she's meeting a couple, why can't they be a couple back. It's highly likely she knew one of them first and when her friend got a partner she is now becoming acquainted with them. Yall are denying OP to even have that right. \n- .\n\n\n- People are allowed to have headaches, it's literally uncontrollable and for someone to have such terrible migraines and be forced to deal with it in a setting that is guaranteed to make it even worse, like have some compassion. We don't police other medical ailments, obv my exp isn't the rule but I've seen people (mil and ex and my ex mil) have headaches so severe it was tied to their poor vision and only getting laser fixed the debilitating migraines. Again y'all are acting like the wife is incapable and the husband is the foreign country like a trip pack mule babysitter whos only purpose is to support his partner. He already took an L at her expense and took care of the children that night and just needed rest. Someone said he could have said something in the morning, but anytime I'm sick i let people know as soon as possible so they can plan in my absence, not tell them last minute especially when the trip is scheduled for 6am, whether that's leaving at 6am or being there by 6am is horrendously early when you need rest but a very understandable time for an outdoor outing when you know it will get hot\n- .\n\n\n- The kids behavior and OPs ability to handle it is being called into question. Like I said earlier, taking care of kids at home is much easier than in a foreign country when your child is crying for familiarity and they don't have it. You can't possibly bring all their toys, all their comforts or bring them home at the drop of a hat. Have all their favourite brands of foods etc\n- .\n\n\n- Lastly, who decided that the babysitters autonomy was controlled by the parents? People are asking that question as if it's a guaranteed solution. A free babysitter like family and a paid for babysitter is not required to go anywhere the parents are going. You think OP and their partner want babysitter grandma (or any family member) to come to their friends house and invade the dinner party? You think grandma wants to get dressed and ready to go to someone else's house they may not know, or go to an outing they are not interested in? Do you guys always bring your uncle's and aunts along to bunch with the girls? Even a paid babysitter is not required to do that. Imagine being in NYC, paying a babysitter while you are going to a friends dinner party with your spouse - and you're expecting your babysitter to be available to *come with you at the drop of a hat without prior notice (as the mother made the decision last minute)*?! Even if they said yes, people are asking that question as if it were a make or break on the situation. Unless you can force your babysitter to do this, this is a variable and determining judgement on a situation where someone can say yes or no is bad logic.", "YTA for acting petty and resentful about the dinner.

So the job fell back on him. \n\nActively watching kids in an adult space is draining. Expecting a chill night and having that rug pulled out sucks. \n\nFocusing on a descriptive word for how he likely felt is really not fair.

It's not like you are staying home and \"babysitting\" your kids. You had plans set up and arrangements made for babysitters so you could enjoy the time with friends. Yes, you are a parent, and you parent them, but in this sense, it's absolutely babysitting. \n\nAs someone who suffers from migraines, all I have to say is FCK everyone else who thinks that you are using a splitting headache as an excuse to not go to the zoo the next day.

I'm more concerned about context. You HAD babysitters you could have left your kids with. Your wife canceled that, so you became the babysitter instead. Makes sense to me. I have two grown boys. My husband was a stay at home dad. If we took them outside the house and one of us had to exclusively watch our kids, we might have called it babysitting, for lack of a better term. Really, with our two we usually only took them out for dinners or visits if both of us could help manage. Two are hard to manage in public, especially at someone else's house. You're right about keeping them from breaking something . . . \n\nWhat concerns me is the headache. I've had debilitating trigeminal neuralgia in my life. There are times that you can't function for pain. And pain (and the medications you take for it) will potentially wipe you out for the next day. Your questions was about going to the zoo or not. You are NTA for opting out of an optional vacation trip to the zoo. You don't have to do or go everywhere. Especially if your wife wouldn't be alone with the kids. You might have been TA if your kids had gotten the zoo canceled last minute and they'd been looking forward to it, but even then, kids need to know that they don't always get their way (like your 2 and 6 year olds opting out of their sitters--we never would have given our boys that option. Let 'em cry. We always found out from caregivers that they stopped crying about 30 seconds after we walked out the door.) \n\nMy suggestion to you is to have more open reasonable communication with your wife before crunch time, ie. we're about to walk out the door.

Why don\u2019t you ask. You say that because that\u2019s probably the case in your relationship. While it may usually be the case, it\u2019s not always. I\u2019ve seen relationships where it\u2019s the guy who does most of the cleaning and watching kids.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with it in my mind.\n\nTo my ear, \"babysit\" implies _responsibility_, _duty_ and even a _chore_ sometimes. I love my kids with all my heart, but when all my friends get together to party on a saturday night, or they organize a trip that I can't attend, I'm very aware that I'm not joining because I'm stuck home _babysitting_.\n\nKids are an absolute bundle of joy. They're also capricious, loud, obnoxious, physically demanding and above all, **profoundly boring**. My 2 year old doesn't have the vocabulary to say anything more fun than \"pipi caca\". And he's the funny one.\n\nParenting is a 24/7 situation. It never ends. And while it has been a source of recurrent joy and pride and plenty of life affirming emotions, it's also been, at many times, a chore.\n\nAround me, all the parents my age get it. We understand it. That's why we throw around the word \"babysitting\". There's a common understanding that \"we don't need to pretend it's paradise all the time\". And all parents get it.\n\nWhich makes me think that the hatred of the word comes mostly from people who are childless, or this weird category of parents who take mean pleasure in criticizing other parents around them in a gossipy toxic way.\n\nThis hatred sounds petty to me. Parenting is hard enough as it is without strangers butting in, acting all high and mighty and policing your words.", "completely disagree. he would\u2019ve \u201cactually parent\u201d at home. it was suppsoe to be a child free dinner. his wife not only demands the kids come, but demands he come too knowing she won\u2019t be watching them.", "No one actually read the post and comprehended what it said, they just see a trigger word and immediately go to the comments.\n\n>>I\u2019ll stay back with the kids\n\nThis is exactly what he suggested.", "I agree, I have been puzzled by the anger over the use of the word \"babysitting\" which we have used regularly in our family and no offense is meant by it.", "Yeah, people rarely think about their unconscious biases. Fuck, they rarely think about their conscientious biases. \n\nIf you are going to judge someone, you gotta eliminate as much as humanly possible from them biases and work strictly with the information given, to the best of ones ability.

I used to get them very regularly until my doctor found the cause and let me tell you something, it ain't relaxing. It's agony, and there's no relief until it's gone. Eventually, all pain killers stop working, then you have to take too much just to get the edge off, and that causes nausea on top of a pain that's still extreme but somewhat tolerable. Then, as fast as it came on (if you're lucky) it just goes away. Mine would last for two or three days at a time with little bits of respite here and there.
