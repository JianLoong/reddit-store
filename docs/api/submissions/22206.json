R is from a foreign country. We are in R\u2019s home country visiting friends and family. Main language in this country is not English. \n\nA little background. We planned to meet R and her friends, who are partnerless and childless, for dinner. We have 2 kids, 2 and 6, and they were to stay with grandpa, uncle and aunt. \n\n2 year old is finding it difficult to be away from us and cries alot but family member don\u2019t care and are ok with it. My wife is not. 6 year old is fine because he can watch iPad or whatever. \n\nThe original plan is no kids at the dinner to meet friends. However, because 2 is having trouble, she is going to go. I\u2019m not happy, but whatever. I know I will have to play babysitter while my wife socializes. 6 year old will stay with family. \n\nWe get ready to leave and say good by to 6. 6 says he doesn\u2019t want to go. We ask why he says he doesn\u2019t. Long story short, he is going now to. \n\nI\u2019m not happy at all but again, whatever. I\u2019m already on babysitter duty so what is one more. As I\u2019m driving I feel a massive headache coming on but think I\u2019ll be able to survive. \n\nWe arrived at friends and we start eating dinner. 6 is not hungry and wants to sleep. Friend brings out a beanie bag for him to sleep in. He ends up playing on it and not sleeping. I\u2019m constantly telling him to knock it off and lay down. He does, for lil but then is back at it.\n\n2 is fine but after she is full, it is terrible 2s. About an hour after arriving, it is time to go. The kids are bad. I can\u2019t join the conversation and I decide to let my wife stay and talk and I\u2019ll take the kids home. \n\nI drive home, 25 min drive and it is bad. Headache is a full on brain splitter. Kids are loud and being siblings and I\u2019m trying to navigate home in the hell hole of driving that exists in this country.\n\nI finally get home, get kids to bed and take medicine. I text wife we are home, safe and going to bed. I mention because of the chaos of tonight, I\u2019m not going to the zoo with everyone tomorrow. I want to stay home and relax. \n\nWe had already planned this adventure. We would be leaving early, 6am and be out in the sun, in insane humidity. Wife would not be alone and would have help with the kids. \n\nIn not so many words, she called me an AH for not going to the zoo. So, am I?\n\nEdit 1: so, I thank everyone for replying. Indeed, there is some resentment for watching the kids this evening. My wife didn\u2019t want to go herself even though I suggested I stay back with the kids. She didn\u2019t want to force 6 to stay with family even though all he would have done is watch tv/ be spoiled by family members. I know there would be  nothing for them to do at the house we were at. We gave an iPad to the kids and it is rare when they both can watch something together. We tried it at the house and it was a day when both wanted something different. \n\nHousing in this country is apartment based and very, very small. There was no taking someone to help watch the kids as that would put them right in the middle of everything. The house was 3 rooms. A bedroom and bathroom, kitchen and living area and a computer/office room. The kids had to be in the living area. \n\nI used the word babysitting because that is what it was. I have no problem parenting and spend more time with the kids than my wife does. However, we were not at our home. We did not have access to the toys/entertainment we have at home. We were in a foreign country, in a small apartment that is not child friendly. I had to constantly watch both kids to make sure they didn\u2019t break or ruin something.", "created_utc": 1689339805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zfx3b/aita_wife_thinks_iatah_for_not_going_to_the_zoo/", "score": 961, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where\u2019s the victim in this story? \n\nYou mean the 2 kids that are in a strange place & didn\u2019t want to be left alone with people they maybe don\u2019t see very often?", "Who do you think the victim is in this story????\n\nThe kids don't know these people and it's understandable a 2yo wouldn't want to be left alone with them.", "NTA\n\nI'm really confused at all the accusations here and the inability to take context in. \n\n- people are accusing OP of treating /taking care of the children as babysitting but OP had a express babysitter. When you're in another country and you arrange for a babysitter, your life while it is to take care of your children, people are allowed to take a break from their kids. Also taking care of kids at home is vastly different than when outside of the country. \n- .\n\n- The mother insisted on bringing the kids along when the father didn't. Unless the mother had concerns with her own *family member* taking care of her child then she should have said, I don't feel X is safe with Y without us. If there was no safety issue then she brought along her kids and expected the husband to babysit while she caught up with her friends, which was fine. OP just couldn't make the event the day after. And if the children are being too difficult to handle, OP dealt with it and didn't even blame the kids, they chalked it up to kid things. Everyone in Reddit expects parents to be 100% perfect 100% of the time and to be able to handle any situation when sometimes kids do things you've never seen before or behaved in a way that was new\n- .\n\n\n- I get that you all are saying when visiting your partners home you should be taking a backseat and allowing them to prioritize reconnecting with their relations, but I thought its rather unfair to expect that. It was very evident OP shared a true interest in meeting partners family and that is not common, and to be honest she's meeting a couple, why can't they be a couple back. It's highly likely she knew one of them first and when her friend got a partner she is now becoming acquainted with them. Yall are denying OP to even have that right. \n- .\n\n\n- People are allowed to have headaches, it's literally uncontrollable and for someone to have such terrible migraines and be forced to deal with it in a setting that is guaranteed to make it even worse, like have some compassion. We don't police other medical ailments, obv my exp isn't the rule but I've seen people (mil and ex and my ex mil) have headaches so severe it was tied to their poor vision and only getting laser fixed the debilitating migraines. Again y'all are acting like the wife is incapable and the husband is the foreign country like a trip pack mule babysitter whos only purpose is to support his partner. He already took an L at her expense and took care of the children that night and just needed rest. Someone said he could have said something in the morning, but anytime I'm sick i let people know as soon as possible so they can plan in my absence, not tell them last minute especially when the trip is scheduled for 6am, whether that's leaving at 6am or being there by 6am is horrendously early when you need rest but a very understandable time for an outdoor outing when you know it will get hot\n- .\n\n\n- The kids behavior and OPs ability to handle it is being called into question. Like I said earlier, taking care of kids at home is much easier than in a foreign country when your child is crying for familiarity and they don't have it. You can't possibly bring all their toys, all their comforts or bring them home at the drop of a hat. Have all their favourite brands of foods etc\n- .\n\n\n- Lastly, who decided that the babysitters autonomy was controlled by the parents? People are asking that question as if it's a guaranteed solution. A free babysitter like family and a paid for babysitter is not required to go anywhere the parents are going. You think OP and their partner want babysitter grandma (or any family member) to come to their friends house and invade the dinner party? You think grandma wants to get dressed and ready to go to someone else's house they may not know, or go to an outing they are not interested in? Do you guys always bring your uncle's and aunts along to bunch with the girls? Even a paid babysitter is not required to do that. Imagine being in NYC, paying a babysitter while you are going to a friends dinner party with your spouse - and you're expecting your babysitter to be available to *come with you at the drop of a hat without prior notice (as the mother made the decision last minute)*?! Even if they said yes, people are asking that question as if it were a make or break on the situation. Unless you can force your babysitter to do this, this is a variable and determining judgement on a situation where someone can say yes or no is bad logic.", "YTA for acting petty and resentful about the dinner.

He describes this as some major ordeal rather than something that is to be expected.", "Yes and OP even said they are in a country where English is not the main language. Its very likely they didn't mean it in the way it's being taken and that is just the word that translated best to explain the story.

He suggested he stayed home and the wife didn't want it. They are on vacation, have a dinner with friends and children care was available.

I don't really understand how people assume that he isn't involved with the kids and that she deserves a break, what if OP is the one who always looks after the kids when they go somewhere and never gets to enjoy visiting anyone.

Which is why babysitting was the best word. Parenting isn\u2019t always easy, it\u2019s annoying and you get headaches. But you do it because you love your kids and you want to spend time with them and be there for their big moments.

We both live in the city we grew up in so it\u2019s a bit lower stakes than op\u2019s situation. Still, if we were traveling with our baby to visit my friends I would want him to hang out and engage to get to know my friends but also I would think that he would do more of the heavy lifting parenting while I got to reconnect with people I don\u2019t get to see that often. We\u2019d do the opposite visiting his friends. Caveat that our baby isn\u2019t born yet, we\u2019re expecting in a few months, but we talk a lot about how we can continue to make space for alone time with our own friends when we have a baby.

No one has to be the asshole for both people in a relationship to be annoyed with each other.", "> How is that even considered acceptable to most people in this thread?\n\nBecause AITA is an extremely selfish board by nature, and in this instance the people this thread caught ended up projecting themselves onto the wife. *They* would want to be the first and only priority on a trip like this, so therefore that's the expectation OP should be expected to meet, and therefore he is a literal demon sent from hell to destroy this poor woman's precious time with her family and friends.", "Both genders say it.", "This is how I interpret it, please correct me if I got anything wrong. They were planning to go to their friend's house for dinner and the kids were supposed to stay with their grandparents. But 2 yo is feeling scared about being left without mom and dad. So they decide to bring 2yo to dinner even though OP isn't happy about that. Because 2yo is coming now the older kid wants to go, because that's how kids work lol. So they all go to a friend's house and after 1 hour Op Decides the kids are being too bad and he has a headache so he takes the kids and leaves because he's mad that he has to \"babysit\" his own kids, while his wife is visiting friends I assume she rarely gets to see.

It's very possible that it could have been a translation issue Especially since that is not his native language and if a word they would use would translate to babysitting he would think that it's the same. \n\nEven if English is his native having something translate to that and hearing other people in the country he lives in use a word that translates to babysitting wouldn't make it seem strange to use that word when using his own native language. He's been in that country a few years now it's possible he forgot the difference in the society that uses English or that because he wasn't a parent in his own country it's just normal to say it in the country he lives in and is raising his children in.", "Ok then why isn\u2019t mom parenting?
