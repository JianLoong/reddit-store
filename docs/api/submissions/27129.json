My dad remarried when I was 7. We\u2019ll call my stepmother Sheila. Sheila is the personification of the tradwife trope and while she\u2019s not Quiverful movement, she comes from a similar background. Basically, her entire self-worth is wrapped up in how many kids she has and how nice her house is kept.  She has a lot of disdain for \u201ccareer women\u201d, especially unmarried, childless ones.  Needless to say, I do not like or agree with Sheila and I have no idea what my dad sees in her. My mom was the opposite. My teenage years were one long, constant argument because (1) I have refused numerous times to be adopted by Sheila, (2) I have 6 half-siblings and I refused to help her raise them, and (3) I am pretty much everything Sheila disapproves of. My dad tried to mediate as best he could but it was a difficult situation.\n\nNeedless to say, I do not go home often. I keep in contact with my dad, but I ignore anything from Sheila unless it\u2019s an emergency. I completed my surgical residency not long ago, so I took some time off for a vacation and a quick visit with my dad before I really get stuck into my practice. I agreed to come to their house for a cookout, knowing that I would probably be annoyed but it was something nice my dad wanted to do for me.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t have children or a partner. I love my career and I like being solo. Still, when I was in undergrad I figured if I\u2019m not going to use my eggs, someone might as well get some use out of them.  So I did 3 rounds of egg donations and put the money towards med school. As a result at last report I have 8 biological offspring.\n\nSheila decided to start her usual \u201cWhen are you going to settle down?\u201d, nonsense, and I was set to ignore her as usual, but then she said \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re better because you have money, a woman\u2019s worth is in her home and children.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWell, that would mean I\u2019m still better than you because I have more bio-children than you do, a nice home, AND a successful career.\n\nShe just stared at me for a minute and left. She didn\u2019t come back outside while I was there. My dad called later to ask what happened and said that even though she shouldn\u2019t have started the conversation in the first place, it was a low blow. She couldn\u2019t have more children after the last one, and she was very upset to be reminded of that, plus she has always thought that I look down on her. I do, but not because of her lifestyle choice, more so because she\u2019s so judgmental about it herself.\n\nAnyway, my dad wants me to apologize. A couple of the older half-siblings have sent me radioactive texts about it. I think she walked in to that one, but given her fertility issues and knowing how much self-concept she has wrapped up in a big family, it might have been a little over the line.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695054050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lzxw6/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_that_by_her/", "score": 3556, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
