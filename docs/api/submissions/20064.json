Am I the asshole for coming out during a car therapy session", "selftext": "I 19 male recently came out to my friends in a car therapy session, a little backstory\nSo I went out with a couple of my friends I\u2019m not gonna use their names for privacy reasons so I\u2019m gonna call them Ally and Ben (Ally 18F and Bben 19M) we were sat in As car at a nice lookout watching the sunset letting out all of our emotions I was in the front passenger seat Ally was in the driver seat and Ben was in the back, after our little therapy session we started asking each other random questions for grin when Ally asked me if I was gonna start looking for a relationship soon (I was still in the closet and didn\u2019t feel ready to come out yet) I kinda just brushed it off as per usual and said I didn\u2019t have the time for a relationship with work and studying, she kept asking me more questions about what my type is in which I again tried to brush off, she then started talking about her type which she was describing me pretty much, she tan followed it by \u201ccan you guess who I like\u201d me and Ben kind of just looked at each other then looked back at Ally as we both knew she was describing me, I acted clueless to avoid answering the question praying that it wasn\u2019t me because I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, she then proceeded to say my name, the answer I was dreading to hear. She started talking about if I like her or would ever consider a relationship to wich I replied \u201ctbh you\u2019re not my type and I think our friendship is to strong to have a relationship, I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship\u201d she then started to tear up, Ben starts asking her why I wouldn\u2019t just date her to make her happy and that I\u2019m a horrible person and should have just let her have a nice moment, I then replied \u201cI don\u2019t want to date her because I don\u2019t want to date a girl, I\u2019m not interested and I\u2019ll never be interested\u201d. It went silent with blank stares all around. I felt so pressured to say that I was shaking. Ally stated that was an asshole move to come out in thag mement because she wasn\u2019t in the right headspace and I should have been there to comfort her instead of making the moment all about me, Ben agreed with her, I got dropped of home and they both stopped speaking to me ignoring my calls and texts except for one telling me not to contact them again as I only care about myself and need to consider other peoples emotions because dropping such \u201cunflattering\u201d news. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this in but ally also claimed that I need to learn how to be more considerate and understanding of her emotions as she said her emotions are more of a bigger deal then me coming out.

Even before you came out asking you to date her so she wouldn't be sad is fucked up\n\nSo is her using that space to ask you out generally; that sounds so uncomfortable and the fact they didn't let up basically forced you to come out to soften the no. You showed a lot more empathy and selflessness than either of them, and I'm sorry you were treated so badly in a moment of vulnerability", "NTA - they are complete jerks. First, you don't have the right to make someone date your anyone else, and getting mad when that person won't do what you want them to makes them the ahole.

Then they pressured you more until you actually had to give the underlying reason. \n\nHard NTA.\n\nThey seem like completely irrational people, but my question to them would be, \"How would you have liked me to handle it? What could I have done differently?\"", "NTA, your friends suck so hard. Pressuring you into a relationship to make her happy without considering how it would make you feel, selfish as hell. Then to play victim after pointing out you are just not compatible bc of orientation. They have some major growing to do still and frankly its good they cut you out saving you the trouble of removing these toxic elements from your life. They fucked up not you so you can continue living your life while they mope and pout like children. Also \"unflattering\"? they can fuck all the way off if they aren't going to be supportive.\nI would work on coming out to parents and such soon though as they might weaponize it against you and you want to be ahead of that", "Nta.

Both of your friends sound horrible.", "NTA.\n\nShe should have accepted your initial response of \u201cI don\u2019t have time for a relationship\u201d and not chosen that moment to admit to having a crush on you. She put you in a position where you were pressured to come out, and your other friend did nothing to stop it, and that is incredibly unfair to you.\n\nI would send them both a message explaining how they made you feel and how uncomfortable it was, and that they need to also consider *your* emotions and the awkward position they put you in.\n\nIf they can\u2019t understand that and handle it like adults, you\u2019ll be much happier and better off without them in your life.", "NTA\n\nThey pressed the issue and you told the truth.

Second, you are not responsible for your friends emotions, feelings or whatever bs they are spouting. That Ally and Ben thought they could manipulate you into dating her even as a pitty date is beyond disgusting. You also need to be very prepared for both of them to put this news out there among their friends and acquaintances and the fallout that is certain to cause drama which may get back to your family.

I hope it doesn\u2019t endure though.", "Nah you're NTA.\n\n- No one should pressure you to date them, regardless of gender. You said no, that should have been it. I've been in a similar position before while I was at school and it sucked.\n- Her emotions aren't more or less important than yours. - - You were forced into a corner and had to come out to make them back off. That's A H behaviour on their part. They should apologise for making you out yourself before they'd leave you alone\n- Saying you're gay/queer/whatever member of the alphabet soup is not 'unflattering news'.

Sounds like they'll take any opportunity to cast themselves as victims. \n\nNTA - Don't waste another thought on these emotionally immature people.", "NTA\n\n\nSounds like Ben likes Ally and is going in as the nice guy.", "NTA- wow your friends should really have stopped pushing and fishing for a different answer than the one you initially gave them", "NTA, did Ben comfort ally after dropping you offlol", "NTA you\u2019re just being honest with her instead of leading her on and saying Surprise I don\u2019t even like women in the future. I feel like you telling her now would save her even more heartbreak in the future", "NTA. First off, congrats on coming out, but I'm sorry it didn't go better. \n\nAlly put you in a bad situation to begin with. Confessing your feelings for a close friend is very risky and has to be done carefully because it can make things very awkward if the feelings aren't returned. Ideally she should have thought about that first and tried to give more subtle signals and see if you returned them before going straight to a confession. And doing it with another friend present was definitely a shitty thing to do because it makes the whole situation more awkward (even if you liked her back) and puts more pressure on you. I'm sure she was nervous and overall it's not wrong for her to confess her feelings, but she's an asshole for the way she went about it.\n\nThen, you rejected her. Which was your right. She should've handled it as gracefully as she could, even if she was disappointed. It would've been less embarrassing for her had she not chosen to confess with Ben in the car too, but that's on her, not you. You didn't do anything wrong.\n\nBen is an asshole for saying you should've dated her to make her happy. That's bullshit. That would be basically the worst possible thing you could've done (aside from maybe like rejecting her in an obviously cruel way). What was his desired outcome from that? Best case scenario that he could've been imagining (though totally unrealistic) you date her out of pity and end up eventually realizing you like her too and then it becomes a great relationship and you both are in love and all that. Except again, that's highly unlikely to happen when you start dating someone out of pity, and even if it did, what happens when she one day somehow finds out you just started dating her to make her feel happy? Then she feels like your relationship is built on a lie and is stuck questioning how you really feel about her, no matter how much you try to convince her that you truly love her now. And that's the best scenario. More realistically, you never fall in love, and eventually she realizes you're not into her or you can't keep up the charade any longer and the truth comes out and you guys end things and your friendship is irreparably destroyed because you've led her on when you were never interested in her. And this is all going off the knowledge Ben had at the time, not knowing that you were gay. Can you imagine how she would've felt to find out that not only did you date her out of pity, but there wasn't even a chance of you one day falling in love because you knew you just weren't attracted to women? That would be downright cruel.\n\nAnd finally, you did nothing wrong by coming out, and they're both assholes for how they responded to you. They forced you to come out by pushing the issue of you not wanting to date her. They could've just accepted that you said no, but they didn't. You weren't trying to make it about yourself. I get that it was probably upsetting for Ally to learn you were gay because that means she really has no shot with you, whereas with just a rejection she could still hope that one day you might change your mind. But she has no right to be mad at you for that. And honestly, I would think that she'd be comforted a little at the same time knowing that at least it wasn't like she wasn't pretty enough for you or you had a problem with her personality, you just don't like girls.\n\nAnd being gay isn't unflattering! Honestly, fuck them for saying that. Ally is welcome to be sad and upset that she's been turned down, but she needs to still handle her emotions and they need to not be homophobes. If they don't come to their senses and start apologizing real soon, you might want to consider whether real friends would treat you like this. Honestly two days is too long already if it were me in your situation.", "God why do people care about others sexualities.  NTA\n\nget new friends", "All I have to say is NTA. And I couldn't imagine how hard being a teen today must be. She was being the selfish one not you. Ben probably is just acting that way towards her in hopes of getting the girl through comfort...I mean perfect timing on his part to side with her so she will cry on her shoulder and have an in with her...", "NTA.\n\n> Ally stated that was an asshole move to come out in thag mement because she wasn\u2019t in the right headspace and I should have been there to comfort her instead of making the moment all about me,\n\nAlly is the one who started this.

These two are not your friends. They've done you a favor by showing you how much they suck. Believe them and look for better people to spend your time with. NTA", "NTA, sounds like you're all still pretty emotionally immature. Just give it time, and they'll either get over or, or you move on. She shouldn't have brought up her crush when you were trapped in a car, and in front of another friend. That was a selfish (insecure) move, and was inappropriate.", "Cause they are homophobes, even if they claim they are not", "Seriously. You don\u2019t date someone to make them happy. You date someone bc you make each other happy! \n\nI question if these ppl are actually 19. And wtf asks someone out in front of someone else? Cringe\u2026.", "It stopped being N A H as soon as Ally told OP she liked him in front of Ben. It was not cool to put him under pressure in this way. \n\nThen Ally and Ben threw themselves a pity party because OP dared to come out, which he only did so at that moment because neither of them would take no for an answer and get off his back. \n\nRead the post again, reverse the genders, and **no way** would you be calling this N A H.", "Lol no way is this N A H. Ally and Ben are way into asshole territory.", "Why is Ally an asshole?", "For starters:\n\n>I kinda just brushed it off as per usual and said I didn\u2019t have the time for a relationship with work and studying, she kept asking me more questions about what my type is in which I again tried to brush off, she then started talking about her type which she was describing me pretty much, she tan followed it by \u201ccan you guess who I like\u201d\n\nOP said he didn't have time for a relationship. That was Ally's cue to stop pushing the issue. Instead, she kept asking about OP's 'type', didn't pick up that he was uncomfortable with the discussion (he tried to brush these questions off) and then told OP that she had a crush on him. Oh, and she chose to do this when Ben was present, therefore putting more pressure on OP to give her the answers she wanted to hear. \n\n>Ally stated that was an asshole move to come out in thag mement because she wasn\u2019t in the right headspace and I should have been there to comfort her instead of making the moment all about me\n\nAlly is an asshole for calling OP an asshole for coming out - he would not have done so at that moment if not for her and Ben pressuring and badgering him. \n\n>ally also claimed that I need to learn how to be more considerate and understanding of her emotions as she said her emotions are more of a bigger deal then me coming out.\n\nAgain, she is an asshole."]}
