Am I the asshole for coming out during a car therapy session", "selftext": "I 19 male recently came out to my friends in a car therapy session, a little backstory\nSo I went out with a couple of my friends I\u2019m not gonna use their names for privacy reasons so I\u2019m gonna call them Ally and Ben (Ally 18F and Bben 19M) we were sat in As car at a nice lookout watching the sunset letting out all of our emotions I was in the front passenger seat Ally was in the driver seat and Ben was in the back, after our little therapy session we started asking each other random questions for grin when Ally asked me if I was gonna start looking for a relationship soon (I was still in the closet and didn\u2019t feel ready to come out yet) I kinda just brushed it off as per usual and said I didn\u2019t have the time for a relationship with work and studying, she kept asking me more questions about what my type is in which I again tried to brush off, she then started talking about her type which she was describing me pretty much, she tan followed it by \u201ccan you guess who I like\u201d me and Ben kind of just looked at each other then looked back at Ally as we both knew she was describing me, I acted clueless to avoid answering the question praying that it wasn\u2019t me because I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, she then proceeded to say my name, the answer I was dreading to hear. She started talking about if I like her or would ever consider a relationship to wich I replied \u201ctbh you\u2019re not my type and I think our friendship is to strong to have a relationship, I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship\u201d she then started to tear up, Ben starts asking her why I wouldn\u2019t just date her to make her happy and that I\u2019m a horrible person and should have just let her have a nice moment, I then replied \u201cI don\u2019t want to date her because I don\u2019t want to date a girl, I\u2019m not interested and I\u2019ll never be interested\u201d. It went silent with blank stares all around. I felt so pressured to say that I was shaking. Ally stated that was an asshole move to come out in thag mement because she wasn\u2019t in the right headspace and I should have been there to comfort her instead of making the moment all about me, Ben agreed with her, I got dropped of home and they both stopped speaking to me ignoring my calls and texts except for one telling me not to contact them again as I only care about myself and need to consider other peoples emotions because dropping such \u201cunflattering\u201d news. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this in but ally also claimed that I need to learn how to be more considerate and understanding of her emotions as she said her emotions are more of a bigger deal then me coming out. Also this only happened 2 days ago and haven\u2019t heard from either of them", "created_utc": 1687181885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dexj7/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_coming_out_during_a_car/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. You did everything fine and they're the ones pressuring you. First your rejection of her wasn't acceptable and then you coming out wasn't acceptable. It's a lose lose. I'm sorry they pressured you to come out :/", "NTA\n\nWTF? You repeatedly emphasized how much you valued them as a friend and cared about them despite not wanting any relationships right now and they kept pressuring.\n\nHow is it \"unflattering\" that you are gay? I don't get it.", "NTA. Ally made a pass at you in front of your other friend, in a situation where no one could easily leave, and then wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer. The ensuing awkwardness was in no way your fault.", "WTAF? Ben and Ally could have done way better in the moment. I understand Ally being confused by your news, especially in her vulnerable moment . . . but both of them should have understood how vulnerable **you** were in that moment as well.\n\nNTA. There's nothing unflattering about this news - they brought their discomfort on themselves by being so insistent. Their behavior in the wake of your news makes them the A H.", "NTA. Emphatic NTA. They asked, and the response seems homophobic. And \"why wouldn't I just date her to make her happy\" is simply toxic - and that moment was about you as much as it was her.", "Nta, and I hope you are in a space to get new friends. If she is willing to treat you like that, she was never your friend - just a girl woth a major crush. And tbh ur other friend might have a crush on her.\n\nWelcome to the queer side \u2661 it's truly not all like this.", "NTA and your friends SUCKKKK", "NTA and oooo boy I have some really unkind words for your friend. Way for her to flip it so SHE needed comforting after pressuring you with her feelings. \n\nGet better friends honey. Your first partner will probably come into your life while you're happy and doing your own thing anyways.", "\u2022 she pressured you into coming out\n\nYou were in the closet, and you kept it that way but she wasn't getting the signals EVEN though you seemed uncomfortable and DODGED her questions.\n\n\u2022 she started crying because you were \"making it all about you\"\n\nYou weren't making it about her??.. You revealed that you liked men because she was crying and you thought she took it in a bad way and you had to anyway.\n\n\u2022 they gaslit u into thinking YWTA\n\nYou are NOT the asshole. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ben starts asking her why I wouldn\u2019t just date her to make her happy and that I\u2019m a horrible person a\" .. what an Ah. this is ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind better friends.", "clearly NTA, you should never date someone you don\u2019t like, it\u2019ll just end up with more hurt feelings down the line. also while maybe not the ideal moment to come out, i can\u2019t blame you for doing it with the way they backed you into a corner", "nta this is fucked up", "NTA, those two are homophobic and shitty. Even before you came out asking you to date her so she wouldn't be sad is fucked up\n\nSo is her using that space to ask you out generally; that sounds so uncomfortable and the fact they didn't let up basically forced you to come out to soften the no. You showed a lot more empathy and selflessness than either of them, and I'm sorry you were treated so badly in a moment of vulnerability", "NTA - they are complete jerks. First, you don't have the right to make someone date your anyone else, and getting mad when that person won't do what you want them to makes them the ahole. Second, they kept pressuring you, which is not ok. Third, then being angry because you aren't cishet? F them. They are terrible people. You deserve better friends.", "Could you have handled it better, sure, but you were pressured into it. If anything A and B should feel ashamed that you don't feel comfortable around them enough to reveal it earlier. NTA", "NAH, the entire situation sucks and I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. I hope you are all able to repair things. Sounds so emotional but I think you were all open and honest with each other and sometimes that can hurt. Wishing you all the best, sorry it came as the result of being pressured but it was very brave of you to share that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ben just added complications to the situation with his presence alone. As someone else said, maybe Ben had feelings and now he's a bit in his feels over it.\n\nLastly, if they really cared about you and your friendship, they wouldn't go this far and cut ties. It's giving homophobia...\n\nI always feel bad about these coming out stories and reinforces why people stay closeted for so long - for this exact reason / reaction. Go on to bigger and better things I say.", "Hahaha what? You literally did consider her emotions first and didn't come out. Then they pressured you more until you actually had to give the underlying reason. \n\nHard NTA.\n\nThey seem like completely irrational people, but my question to them would be, \"How would you have liked me to handle it? What could I have done differently?\"", "NTA, your friends suck so hard. Pressuring you into a relationship to make her happy without considering how it would make you feel, selfish as hell. Then to play victim after pointing out you are just not compatible bc of orientation. They have some major growing to do still and frankly its good they cut you out saving you the trouble of removing these toxic elements from your life. They fucked up not you so you can continue living your life while they mope and pout like children. Also \"unflattering\"? they can fuck all the way off if they aren't going to be supportive.\nI would work on coming out to parents and such soon though as they might weaponize it against you and you want to be ahead of that", "Nta. Those weren't your friends sadly. I'm sorry they pressured you into coming out and it went like that. You did nothing wrong tho, don't let them make you feel otherwise here. Ally sounds like she thinks she feels enough for everyone around her \ud83d\ude12", "I think it\u2019s NAH.  Ally is not wrong for having a crush on you, and you\u2019re never wrong for living your truth.  It\u2019s unfortunate that this is how it turned out, but you handled yourself perfectly.\n\nNote:  This is exactly why I won\u2019t ever ask a friend on a date unless they first express interest in me.", "Sorry but your friends seem like unsupportive a-holes.  They set you up during you friend therapy session to get you to date Ally.  You were very kind in explaining, you did nothing wrong.  I\u2019m sorry your friends let you down.  NTA.", "NTA Ally sucks man", "NTA, and ironic that you're calling her ally because she isn't being very good one.", "Nta,  and if Ally was a guy, she would be that creeper dude that tells you that you're \"not really all that hot\".  Both of your friends sound horrible.", "NTA.\n\nShe should have accepted your initial response of \u201cI don\u2019t have time for a relationship\u201d and not chosen that moment to admit to having a crush on you. She put you in a position where you were pressured to come out, and your other friend did nothing to stop it, and that is incredibly unfair to you.\n\nI would send them both a message explaining how they made you feel and how uncomfortable it was, and that they need to also consider *your* emotions and the awkward position they put you in.\n\nIf they can\u2019t understand that and handle it like adults, you\u2019ll be much happier and better off without them in your life.", "NTA\n\nThey pressed the issue and you told the truth. You didn\u2019t hijack anything. You need better friends babe.", "NTA, first I'm sorry you were put in a situation that you felt you had no choice but to come out when you were not prepared for it. Second, you are not responsible for your friends emotions, feelings or whatever bs they are spouting. That Ally and Ben thought they could manipulate you into dating her even as a pitty date is beyond disgusting. You also need to be very prepared for both of them to put this news out there among their friends and acquaintances and the fallout that is certain to cause drama which may get back to your family. This is just a shit show waiting to happen and again I'm sorry that this is happening.", "Fucking car therapy? \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA", "Its unflattering because OP should know better than to be gay when the obvious choice of partner was his friend (sarcasm).", "Initially no assholes as the situation was very emotional but then gaslighting him into thinking he is wrong is a pretty asshole move tbh.", "I must have glazed over that. I didn\u2019t see gaslighting here but more just some emotional peeps trying to navigate life and relationships. I hope it doesn\u2019t endure though."]}
