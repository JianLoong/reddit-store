My wife has been on an extended 'maternity leave' but on top of that we've also hired a nanny/maid to assist us with the baby as well as keep the house in order. She stays in our guest house. To celebrate our anniversary I planned for us to take a trip by ourselves just to reconnect and give her some proper time away from the our son. She was excited about leaving but was slightly concerned about leaving our son behind (her mother was going to come down and babysit with the nanny). Trying to ease things I asked the nanny if she'd be willing to come along with us on our trip and take care of the baby - stressing that this was supposed to be our couple vacation so most of the childcare will be hers and more than usual. She jumped at the idea and so I also arrange her ticket and accomodation (to be clear she was also paid extra for the 'overtime'). \n\nThe trip was a week long and our arrangement was going quite well at first. My wife was relaxed, we reconnected and our son was close by for whenever we missed him. We would take our son and give her a break either in the mornings or afternoons. On our last day she asked if we could take the night shift as she'd met someone who'd asked her on a date. Besides that going against our arrangement (the point was to give us a break from the sleepless nights), I'd already paid and planned an intimate date on the beach with my wife for our last night. It became a bit of an issue with her trying to guilt my wife and saying we were being unfair but by the end of it, we didn't give in and she looked after the kid. Upon returning my wife heard her on the phone saying that she was thinking of quiting over all of this and that we were blocking her future so here we are. \n\nWife thinks we made a mistake, I don't disagree that it might've been assholish but ultimately it was our arrangement and she was paid extra for it. Are we the assholes?\n\nEdit: the post has been up for 12 hours at the time of writing this and this is the first time checking in since the first hour due to life but I just wanted to clarify some things I've seen come up.\n\n1) She got paid double her usual daily rate. Since she has consistent our daily we just refer to it as daily rate where she 'works' 8 hours. So we paid her for 16 hours of work daily.\n\n2) Our expectations were very clearly expressed to her and she agreed that it wouldn't be a problem. Depending on our plans, some times we took mornings and sometimes we took afternoons but on any given day it was one of the two. This was also preplanned since our trip had an itinerary. Each of these breaks averaged about 5 hours and that excludes the spontaneous breaks whenever we missed him and prepared him for bed.\n\nAlso this assumption that my wife and I can't and don't take care of our child is silly. The nanny is there only to assist whenever my wife needs to nap/rest. My wife takes care of most of the childcare and I step in when I get back from work. Most of her [maids] work is housework. My wife is staying in home because of her traumatic birth which had complications she's still recovering from. She fully plans on returning to work when she's fit and our child is old enough. \n\n", "created_utc": 1704412911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ys9c5/aita_for_not_letting_our_nanny_leave_for_a_date/", "score": 4744, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So that she still has her separate and clear time off. If your nanny had stayed home with the kids and your mother in law ...

That being said she was also AH in that asking to change the schedule for a date, without asking if you had previous plans was ridiculous.

People with nannies travel with them frequently and set up the expectation for hours they would work. So many in the comments think the parents are assholes just because they want time to relax?

She needed to be paid for 168 hours if travel was during those 7 days, if not then plus travel time too.", "That's my issue, I highly doubt this was anywhere close to legally compensated. \"A few hours here and there\" does not a break make. I'm going to assume these are wealthy people and therefore are paying a decent rate for an agency nanny... let's go with 30/hr. \nWhere I am in California you have to pay 1.5x for hours 8/9 through 12 (depending on how they nanny is classified) and then 2x for all hours over 12. On a 24 hour shift, you would get 4 unpaid meal periods and 5 paid rest periods. That amounts to a minimum of 1,050 if we deduct 2 hours for the unpaid meal periods (we are counting the \"mornings and evenings\" as compensating for the lunches and rest periods. Which is dumb and illegal, but lets roll with it).\nNow, for all caregivers traveling away from home with their work family, the emoloyer provides a meal/expense stipend per diem so that any expenses they are incurring (that they wouldn't if they were at home), are covered by the employer. This includes car rental, groceries, restaurants etc. This usually runs 200-300/day depending on various factors. So we are at 1250 per day minmum... however, once we hit 40 hours of regular time for the week, all hours become OT. So after day 5, you come in and are immediately making at least 1.5x (idk how this works at this point exactly). You are paying out at least 1385 per day (on the conservative side). The overall pay for your 22 hours of paid work per day for 7 days is $9020. \n\nThis doesn't even factor in that all hours spent traveling to/from the location actually count as work hours and are supposed to be compensated per their hourly rate and DO count toward overtime. \nSo, assuming you paid out somewhere in the range of 10k-15k for this week of work... then yeah... sure. You did right.\nBut I doubt it.", "Doesn\u2019t it pretty much answer this in the post?

I got paid $200 a week, and I worked probably 14 hours a day and lived like I was on house arrest. When I finally met someone I wanted to go for coffee with a couple of times when I wasn\u2019t supposed to be working, the family flipped out.

I was only on 24hr kid duty a handful of times, but mostly did 8-12hrs. \n\nI was compensated VERY generously for this trip. VERY generously.

And it sounds like the nanny had to work all nights with the child as well. Normally when families take a nanny on vacation, the nanny gets their own separate room - they are entitled to some separation and privacy. OP said he stressed that the nanny would be doing more childcare than usual - I wonder if he specifically made it clear to the nanny ahead of time that she would be responsible for all nights, sharing a room with the child, and would have no privacy at all.\n\nAlso, OP said the nanny got breaks - but from his description it sounds like these were not organized or planned, but on a whim? So the nanny was actually on-call 24 hours a day?\n\nIt sounds like OP WAY underpaid her, too. Even if she agreed to the rate, if she worked more than twice the number of hours per day she normally works, but he only doubled her daily rate - that is vastly underpaying her. (He does understand that she should have been being paid for all the hours she was on-call, right? Not just hours worked? So if she were on-call 24 hours a day, that\u2019s how many hours she should have been compensated each day. And yes, that is an absolutely bananas expectation to have of a nanny.)\n\nMost nannies charge a flat overnight fee in addition to their hourly+overtime pay when they\u2019re away when they\u2019re sleeping in their *own* room and not on night duty (plus travel costs, plus travel time, plus private accommodation, plus all meals on and off the clock). Not to mention it\u2019s illegal to pay nannies a daily rate in the US. They\u2019re supposed to be hourly, and they get time and a half for every hour over 40 per week\u2026 so it sounds like you not only underpaid her but you also did it illegally.\n\nYTA, OP.

Most of those women suffer through it, no nannies, sometimes by themselves (hopefully with a supportive spouse), no vacations. Your nanny is the primary caregiver to your son.

It seems the conditions were clear, and involve at least some overtime, though the fact that the OP put 'overtime' in quotes makes me wonder how much OT they're paying the nanny.\n\nEDIT: In one of the OP's comments, he says that they're paying her double her daily pay for what's essentially a 168 hour work week. Given that an hourly worker - which nannies are supposed to be - would earn **much** more than 2.4x their weekly pay of they worked a 168 hr work week, I think the OP is the AH in this case for not treating her fairly.\n\nEDIT2: I punched in 24/7 into an [overtime calculator](https://www.worklawyers.com/overtime-calculator-california/) for my state (California), and it said that **276 hours should be paid** (40 hours non-OT, 40 hours time and a half, and 88 hours double OT). The **OP is paying her only 100 hours** (if you count her daily pay to be for 8 hours/day).", "\"still feel the need to chime in\"\n\nOP created a thread where he asked for people's opinions on the situation. If OP didn't want people chiming in the why go on reddit and ask for it?", "If anyone is anti-work it\u2019s the OP and his wife who doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t care for her kid, since they pay someone else to do it (at home and on vacation) while not being responsible for the household. Yet they are the ones who are exhausted.", "Is your husband an hourly employee?", "A morning is like 8 a.m to 11 a.m the afternoon is like 12 to 4. \n\nShe got maybe 3 or 4 hours off each day since she was responsible for the overnights.", "If you've read The Nanny Diaries  the author explains that she used to work as a nanny and many of the situations she writes about are based on experiences  she, and nannies she knew,  had while working.\n\nI also knew a nanny that was working for a wealthy family.in the 1990s .

It seems such a strong bond to be considered a job and then move along when the child is older. Sounds like a lot of trauma and loss.", "Clearly the love from this kind of parent is not even enough for them to watch him for one day. So no hope for them.", "Being upset at adults who are behaving poorly does not in any way shape or form mean she would mistreat the innocent child in her care. \n\nI'm curious as to where ppl are getting that she was so upset and angry and not wanting to be there? Is it just because her private convo was eavesdropped on by the known assholes in the story? She should be questioning if she wants to continue this relationship.", "That doesn't make it right! But I guess you were responding to the post about them only being parents on social media.  Parents used to bring a \"brag book\" of baby photos to show around. These days, everything is on your phone & yes, possibly on social media, as well. I used to care for a psych professor who was in a wheelchair. We flew to Louisiana for a big psychiatric conference & I got one afternoon off. Although she  brought her own assistance devices, we quickly realized that they could not be set up like they were at home & I became absolutely necessary,  to help lift her from her wheelchair to the toilet & back again. She was paranoid that a stranger might drop her. On the airplane, I had to go behind her, apologizing for her behavior & language! The airlines use this narrow trolly to get handicapped ppl to their seats & the professor did not feel safe on it, even though she was strapped in, so she vented at everyone! \n\nAnyway, before we left for the conference, we had agreed upon certain hours, including my having evenings off. With restrooms being a non-negotiable problem, I  understood her need to have me available, but wow, I was burnt-out by the end of the trip! \n\nOne evening, she declined to give me a break, so I just went up to the room. I remember renting movies from the hotel's pay-per-view channel, knowing it was going on her bill & figuring I deserved at least that  much. And she never mentioned it, so I guess she realized how difficult the situation was for me. Or she just paid the total & never looked at the itemization. She was probably reimbursed by UCI to attend, anyway. But I also had her pay for some chiropractor visits after we got home, since lifting & turning her to align with the toilet or her wheelchair really messed up my back. She knew she was difficult to work for & at home, she also had a backup person for my 2 days a week off.\n\nOur only other trip was to NY & while we had similar issues, she trusted her friends to lift her, so I got a couple of days to visit my cousin in RI. However, then I had to cancel a helicopter ride around the Statue of Liberty, (which would have ticked off 2 boxes on my bucket list), bc her one friend needed to visit his partner in the hospital & wasn't available to help her as planned that day. 30 some yrs later, I've still never gotten a second chance at either the helicopter ride or visiting Lady Liberty. I was devastatingly disappointed!\n\nThis scenario doesn't seem to have any built-in boundaries for the nanny. It would have helped if OP gave her an itinerary of his plans so she could plan around them. I've cared for a toddler for 3 days straight, while the parents were out of town. It was exhausting, even though he was a great little kid & didn't fuss bc Mom & Dad were not home. \n\nOP, IMO YTA, for not giving your nanny an itinerary & updating as necessary. Just bc you paid for her trip, does not entitle you to monopolize all of your nanny's time as your own. She deserves some time off, too & it should be scheduled in advance so she can make her own plans. We get that your trip was not a vacation for her, but don't burn your bridges. A good nanny can be hard to find. Treat your help like you'd like to be treated, with some common decency & find ways to accommodate their lives. The nanny is not your child's parent; you are!", "Oh ok. I\u2019ve never heard it used before but I don\u2019t find any of op\u2019s post to reflect that he thinks their baby is the best or as a term of endearment. The post makes it seem like their baby is an inconvenience to the op but maybe I\u2019m not reading the tone correctly", "She could have easily met this person on a dating app like Tinder or Bumble. If a girl told me it was her last day in town I\u2019d figure I have nothing to lose by asking her out.", "My daughter spoke with a Canadian accent, and used Canadian words when she started talking. She was only with her sitter 3 to 5 days a week, 7 to 8 hours.", "If OP had mentioned maybe mom dealing with postpartum or anything that would actually explain needing a ***live in nanny*** and the extended maternity leave, I\u2019d be waaaaay less ready to vote YTA. It sounds more like the baby stresses them out by being a baby so they hired some poor soul to play parent while they go about their lives. Props to mom at least not wanting to go without her baby, that at least says *she* cares about their child.", "I mean she couldn't get one evening off in a week. She should just quit. I wouldn't work for OP in any capacity.\n\nThey try to make it sound like the nanny was clamouring for the awesome opportunity for the trip, but she ended up spending the entire time taking care of a less than year old baby. It's like thinking you are generous for bringing someone to an amazing restaurant and not giving them a chance to eat. What an ingrate the nanny is!", "It's not. I nannied in the USA years ago. At least under the Visa type I was on, they weren't allowed to work us more than 10 hours a day to a max of 40 hours per week. But this entitled SAHM took off for a long weekend without the kids with no notice. Just left me there with them. I'd only been with the family for 10 days at that point. I didn't stick around much longer.\n\nI appreciate that a lot of nannies aren't on visas, but I can't imagine the labour laws being that much kinder to immigrants.", "Not shocking at all. I've seen how fucked up a good number of wealthy white kids turn out.", "Like great OP,  you had a special night planned and paid for.

The phrase without context just isn't something I see as inherently problematic. But I'm from a long line of working poor, rural people, so some of the stuff OP is saying sounds NUTS to me lol. I had to quit my job when I had my daughter because we can't afford childcare, so a vacation nanny isn't something I could even fathom lol.", "Looking at his last paragraph, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s saying to the nanny, \u201cI know we are not being fair to you, but you agreed to it so you have to do it.\u201d", "Agreed.  Those parents must be Total.BOZOS!", "Yeah. I'm sure there's a huge spectrum in a job like that, but I'm kinda guessing she is getting screwed and resentful for good reason.", "That's exactly why. I was a Nanny in westport CT for years. They are trophy kids. Tote them out for Christmas cards, when the husband needed to be seen as a 'family man' or when the wife needed to say she has a 'job'. Iwas basically on call 24/7. I got a call once from a mom that I had to come take care of the kids at 2am bc the daughter had a fever and was throwing up, \"I can't deal with this! I have a brunch tomorrow!\".", "Why are you putting the word work into quotations?

Since she has consistent our daily we just refer to it as daily rate where she 'works' 8 hours.\n\nPutting the word in any form of marks like that is a big flappy red flag. That is your employee. They are working for you. It's not \"quote un-quote work.\" It's not \"kinda work.\" It's work. Pay her.\n\n> So we paid her for 16 hours of work daily.\n\nI wonder if you have the courage to post what state or country you're from so we can see if you're violating overtime laws.\n\n> 2) Our expectations were very clearly expressed to her\n\nThis roughly translates to \"We believe contract law is just a suggestion.\"\n\n> and she agreed that it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nOh yeah, I bet. You know, since you're her employer, and you have inherent power over whether she can afford to pay her bills, I'm sure she absolutely consented to this arrangement without any implicit coercion.\n\n> Depending on our plans, some times we took mornings and sometimes we took afternoons but on any given day it was one of the two. This was also preplanned since our trip had an itinerary. Each of these breaks averaged about 5 hours and that excludes the spontaneous breaks whenever we missed him and prepared him for bed.\n\nSo by your own admission you paid her for 16 hours but she was working or on call for 19. Nice!\n\n> Also this assumption that my wife and I can't and don't take care of our child is silly. The nanny is there only to assist whenever my wife needs to nap/rest.
