My wife has been on an extended 'maternity leave' but on top of that we've also hired a nanny/maid to assist us with the baby as well as keep the house in order. She stays in our guest house. To celebrate our anniversary I planned for us to take a trip by ourselves just to reconnect and give her some proper time away from the our son. She was excited about leaving but was slightly concerned about leaving our son behind (her mother was going to come down and babysit with the nanny). Trying to ease things I asked the nanny if she'd be willing to come along with us on our trip and take care of the baby - stressing that this was supposed to be our couple vacation so most of the childcare will be hers and more than usual. She jumped at the idea and so I also arrange her ticket and accomodation (to be clear she was also paid extra for the 'overtime'). \n\nThe trip was a week long and our arrangement was going quite well at first. My wife was relaxed, we reconnected and our son was close by for whenever we missed him. We would take our son and give her a break either in the mornings or afternoons. On our last day she asked if we could take the night shift as she'd met someone who'd asked her on a date. Besides that going against our arrangement (the point was to give us a break from the sleepless nights), I'd already paid and planned an intimate date on the beach with my wife for our last night. It became a bit of an issue with her trying to guilt my wife and saying we were being unfair but by the end of it, we didn't give in and she looked after the kid. Upon returning my wife heard her on the phone saying that she was thinking of quiting over all of this and that we were blocking her future so here we are. \n\nWife thinks we made a mistake, I don't disagree that it might've been assholish but ultimately it was our arrangement and she was paid extra for it.

You should have given her a fixed schedule with all the exact things she would be doing every hour. A roster. Then she should have planned around it just like any other job.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry too much about over hearing someone's conversation saying they want to quit. I think there isn't someone alive who hasn't said they want to quit their jobs. \n\nIf it was your daughter though, I'd be saying YTA", "Yta. \n\nDon't care how much extra you paid. \n\nYou told her more childcare. A few hours off a day is not more childcare. That's abuse. \n\nShe had a right to ask for a night off. Nanny or not to expect someone to pretty much take over 24/7 when they are not the parent is insane. She is a nanny and has no kids. You needed a break even with a nanny, but yet expected her to handle it all.\n\nSo it was your vacation. You invited her to watch your child but gave her no chance to do anything. So you paid her accommodation and ticket. Well, you should have as it was you paying her a job. That's not an extra. That's common sense. \n\nTo be upset she wanted one night to enjoy after a week of not getting to decide when she could take a break if she needed one and then only a few hours which means not getting to leave or sightsee or anything because who knew when you woukd decide when she was back on duty is insane. \n\nLet me put it this way. Unless you explicitly told her. You have a few hours off a say. That she didn't get to decide what time she had off. That she wouldn't get a day or even afternoon or evening off. Unless you told her that. Unless the extra you paid her for was hourly, then that's abusing the contract for any childcare. Thats taking advantage of someone who sounds young, not understanding and able to grasp what you meant and how hard it would be. That's you showing as the person paying her for that not only are you not understanding but not saying in no uncertain terms what is expected. Of course, she wants to quit. You have proven that you can't be trusted to make sure as the one in charge that she is fully informed yo be fully able to make a decision so why woukd she think it wouldn't happen again.", "YTA - both for expecting your nanny to be a \"maid\" also and for making her work every day without a single off day during your vacation.

That's what this was.\n\nI understand her frustration but she needs to realize she was being inappropriate.\n\nI'd fire her immediately since her plan is to quit and leave you without childcare unexpectedly, and get someone who's actually prepared to dedicate to the job on your terms. An older lady with no husband or preferably a spinster or widow.", "YTA", "YTA. Everyone saying NTA has no idea how nannying actually works.

When was she sleeping?", "Quite honestly you are both the YTA.... My brother brings his nanny on vacation. And gets her a separate room from where we are staying. So that she still has her separate and clear time off. If your nanny had stayed home with the kids and your mother in law ... There would also have been more down time where she wasn't responsible for the baby ( presumably). So it's really unrealistic to assume this is like the eras of times gone by where the servants didn't have much of a life outside of watching the children.  That being said she was also AH in that asking to change the schedule for a date, without asking if you had previous plans was ridiculous. I think this is a case of both parents and nanny not having clear and reasonable expectations. 16 hour days for a week isn't reasonable. Neither was asking you to change your plans.", "NTA. This was a particular vacation situation where she agreed to do all the care and was being paid extra for it. Had it gone on for longer than a week without a real break, it would be a different story. \n\nDoes the fact that she called it \"blocking her future\" mean she's looking to move on from nannying as soon as she finds a partner who can support her?", "I just came here to say that we are not in the same tax bracket. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA - unless you paid her 8hrs a day at 1x and 16hrs a day at 1.5 (so 4x her normal \u201cday rate\u201d) you grossly underpaid her.

You shouldn\u2019t have brought along the baby and nanny in the first place if you wanted it to be a couples trip.

Or how are you compensating her for working 7 days a week?\n\nYou are parents 24/7. She is only a nanny for the hours you pay for. You needed to specifically negotiate what hours you are paying for here in advance, not just expect her to be available, and I'm unclear if that happened.", "Info - how long we're the breaks you were giving her? \n\nAre there not laws in your country about how many hours in a row can be worked and time off etc? Because if you were giving her like an hour break and she was basically working a 160 hour week that's totally unreasonable in my opinion. Someone else has commented saying it's like a work trip on work trips you don't usually work nearly 24 hours a day the entire time.", "Now I gotta see what's on r/nanny", "Yta. You should have given her a minimum of one night off. You abused her kindness", "Lol", "Tell me you've never had a nanny without telling me.", "Well on work trips I get a room and flight otherwise I would quit(like she is doing)", "It's not a free trip.

The nanny was on night duty every night, which alone would have been more than enough for a work trip. Then apparently she was also on most-of-the-day duty every day for 7 days.\n\nThat's one hell of an extreme work trip. They should have given her one full day off to explore where ever it was they went or they should have left the kid at home with the MIL and nanny. And it's wild OP wants credit for paying for her flight and hotel room when he was working her far more than 8 hours every single day of the 7 day trip. Like, did he think she should pay for the privilege of caring for his kid?\n\nI'm really curious how they suggested this scheme to the nanny and if they made it clear she'd be responsible for their child 20+ hours a day for each of the 7 days.", "She didn't get any fulls days off during the vacation. Either the morning or the afternoon off on a particular day. That was the pre decided arrangement.

You don't have to get up with them if they're sick or having a bad dream. And, if God is good, they don't pee or poop themselves and need cleaning up in the middle of the night.

You wouldn't take a job without knowing the pay?", "And did you increase that daily rate when you essentially put her on the clock for 24 hours?", "I'm a nanny too.

Because if she's only getting off morning OR afternoon every day...", "I worked traveling for a bit. There was an 8 week stretch we were staying right on the lake. Anyway, first week, we didn't get our full per diem. The excuse was 'You guys are in cabins on the lake! It is like a free vacation!' Nah, not how it works. I love the setting, I am thankful for the setting but I still gotta eat. I am working up to 14 hours a day, I don't get to fully enjoy the lake, it ain't the perk you think. \n\nWe got the full per diem.
