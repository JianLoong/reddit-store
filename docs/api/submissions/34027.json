I was the only Dad she knew. However Amelia bio dad, mother was very active in Amelia life, which I didn't mind. I raised and loved her as my own. She called me dad. She was a good kid. Intelligent and charming. Me and Jane had more children. Amelia often went to her grandmother house on the weekends and holidays. \n\n6 months before Amelia turned 18, her grandmother died. Amelia found out her grandmother left her alot of money. But she could not access it until she was 18. When she found out about the money her attitude did a complete switch. She started disrespecting our rules and when we tried to pull her in, she just told us she be 18 soon and she won't need us anymore. She also started bullying her siblings and when we intervened she called us poor and said that we were beneath her. Now me and my wife aren't wealthy, but we do make a decent living between us that allows us to live comfortably. \n\nWe tried to sit her down, and talk about therapy and also tried to bring up how she can use the money wisely, but she refused therapy and yelled at me that I wasn't her father and I don't get to tell her what to do. That hurt! She was an absolute nightmare during thoses 6 months. Her siblings were afraid of her at that point. Anything we said was meet with disrespect. When she turned 18 she got access to the money. And she didn't move out right away like she had been threathing to do but instead started calling us all her slaves and said she was richer then us all. We ended up kicking her out when she destroyed her siblings tablet because he refused to give it to her to use. She said she didn't care. She left and went NC with us. My wife cried and the following weeks we tried to keep tabs on her, but Amelia found out and threatened to call the police on us for stalking so we gave up. Ngl it was a relief she was gone. \n\n\nThen after a year, she called my wife crying. We find out she's homeless and broke and she wants to come home. My wife wanted to go pick her up immediately, but I was against it and said if we go get her now what's stopping her from treating us all the same before she left? I don't want her back here! My wife called me cruel and heartless and left to go get her anyway. Maybe I am being cold hearted?

I get your fears, but real life did a number on her and may have taught her a lesson in a big way. You don't want her getting addicted to drugs (or OD) and/or knocked up by some moron, which is VERY common with young homeless people. Your wife is very valid in her extreme concern. So how about a compromise? Have her stay at a hotel nearby and have her come over to talk. Lay down the law, be BRUTAL about her disrespect, arrogance, malice, spitefulness and lack of gratitude. She owes your whole family a BIG apology, both together and one on one. If she is willing to and it is genuine, slowly reintroduce her back so the kids can rebuild some trust in her, at least enough to give her a chance. Don't expect it all at once, but give it a real chance.\n\nStipulate weekly individual therapy with some family sessions to clear the air.  She needed a reality check, and I think life may very well have given it to her HARD. Keep an open mind and don't disregard her ability to change as she is still young and you don't know the source of this highly atypical behavior. Plus you could also force her hand to get an education while working a job, and that would be great to teach responsibility and great for her future! Use that leverage while you got it!\n\n**HOWEVER**, I an VERY worried about the sudden personality change. She is at the age many mental illnesses hit fast and hard.  Bipolar and Schizophrenia to name two. They can quickly present themselves and accelerate at any time.  She could have been masking symptoms till it just became too much with a trigger and BANG, manic as a jackrabbit. (think holding a beachball underwater and letting it go) Which is what this sounds like to me.  I'm bipolar II and this sounds exactly like a version of my old outbursts and swings. Of course that is no excuse as it is probably feeding off of existing entitlement while amplifying it. Again like I did. For me personally I needed a reality check to see and understand consequences. Hers was (hopefully) homelessness mine was HIV and realizing I had an alcohol problem. Both can really knock some sense into someone, especially if still young... but if this is the case and she doesn't get treatment, you have a VERY high risk of loosing her to addiction, suicide, murder on the street, prostitution/human trafficking etc. You just won't know without a psychiatric workup.\n\n*Edit:* Have her sign a contract before she can stay for any length of time. No matter her current mental state. This was suggested by another redditor and makes sense.", "Damn. NTA f your stepdaughter tbh.\nEdit: and that amount of money leaving in a year is suspicious.", "NTA because she repeatedly traumatized the family and has offered no apologies upon reaching out to you. The issue now is what to do when your wife brings her back in the next couple of hours.", "NTA although if you want to avoid a rift with your wife, I\u2019d take her back for a trial\nperiod with strict boundaries, violation of which ought to result in her being kicked out. She should also have to sit down and apologize to her siblings.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't the A for not wanting a disrespectful, needy adult to return to your home without notice, however, you are so screwed. When she returns, but before she settles in to her room, be ready with a contract for her to sign giving her rules to abide by, bill percentages she must pay while living in your home, and a date of departure you should be very clear about enforcing. Make sure her mother also reads and understands the contract and your willingness to enforce it fully by handing a copy to each of them upon their arrival, no matter how tired they claim to be when they appear. This is about the only way you can weather the emotional storm heading your way with your wife since she's chosen to make this big decision without consideration for your input. Good luck.", "As a mother, if I was married to someone who expected me to leave my child on the street they'd be my ex husband.  Period.  It doesn't matter what my kid does, I love them.\n\nWhat's to stop her?  A few things... but you lost the ability to start this off the right way by hardlining the no with your wife.  You will have to fix that when she returns... and have a chat with her.\n\nYou are willing to forgive your step-daughter and of course you don't want to leave her homeless.  You're sorry for even suggesting that.  However, given the way things went before and because she is an adult there will need to be some conditions... ones around work, schooling/future planning, domestic duty sharing, etc.\n\nI'm not usually of the \"parent an adult\" mindset, but I suspect that this adult may need it.  Get the wife on board then sit down with the daughter and discuss the go-forward plan.", "NTA. Of course your wife loves her child, but the other kids are afraid of her. Nobody should have to live with someone they're afraid of.", "NTA", "I'm gonna be honest, the AH here is Amelia's grandmother. Leaving a shitload of money to an 18 year old with no restrictions is just boneheaded. That could've been put in a trust, used for schooling or whatever, but an 18 year old who gets that kind of money will generally piss it away.\n\nI understand where both you and your wife are coming from, and frankly Amelia is a dumb kid, so I say NAH. \n\nI think that you should allow Amelia back in, because if you don't, your marriage is probably over, but there need to be conditions, mainly she can't bully her siblings. She needs to go to school or get a job. She needs to be made aware that you do have the power to kick her out again.", "Nta. If you have somewhere else to go then I\u2019d have yours and the other kids bags packed by the time your wife and stepdaughter get home. She doesn\u2019t get to come back after how she\u2019s treated everyone and your wife needs a reality check.", "NTA", "I'm sorry but I refuse to believe this happened. She loved y'all so much and yet when she got inheritance money she completely turned on y'all and called y'all slaves?? No this doesn't happen. Information Is being left out.. Either y'all weren't as good of a parent as u say or she was being told to hate y'all or whatever. But children who love their parents don't do this.\n\nEdit: I know I'll get downvoted but I don't care. This story Is very much so fake!!... lol", "INFO\n\nAre you her dad?", "NTA. For her to go through alot of cash and is now broke and homeless, dr*gs are a likely factor. I would say request a drug test, and if she's positive, offer help to get her in a rehab facility. I second the recommendations to lock away all valuables. Also, sit your wife and other kids down without stepdaughter to discuss how everyone feels about her returning home before agreeing to an extended stay.", "NTA\nPut your foot down for your family. She will act worse because she got away with it before and now she is bitter.", "As u/Mysterious_Pea_5008 said:\n\n>When she returns, but before she settles in to her room, be ready with a contract for her to sign giving her rules to abide by, bill percentages she must pay while living in your home, and a date of departure you should be very clear about enforcing.\n\nFor the love of whatever benevolent deities, PLEASE do this.\n\n>handing a copy to each of them upon their arrival, **no matter how tired they claim to be when they appear.**\n\n**Make sure they read it AND sign it.**\n\nIf one of the other kids got her room, do NOT make that child move. Amelia chose to leave after bullying the family, saying y'all were her *slaves* and beneath her. She should NOT be allowed to continue this reign of terror.\n\nETA: verdict, NTA", "If it\u2019s only been a year since she moved out after being horrible/verbally abusive to her siblings. \n\nI\u2019d also be concerned as to where this large sum of money went in a year\u2019s time. She could have just frivolously spent the money or possibly developed a serious drug addiction. \n\nI would consider having a meeting/lunch/dinner/whatever outside of the home and see where her headspace is. If she is drug free and remorseful then consider letting her back. If not, you have other children you need to guide and protect.", "I don\u2019t want to call you TA because I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from but I do wonder if you\u2019d feel the same if she was your biological daughter. I also think that if you say no it will be the beginning of the end of your marriage.\n\nIt seems that you all had a good relationship for a long time up until the final 6-12 months when everything changed. She obviously did a lot to break down that relationship but is it now so dead that you want her living in a homeless shelter?\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s made some massive mistakes. I dread to think what she\u2019s been doing for the past year that\u2019s left her in this situation. The way she treated you was unacceptable but she was young and it seems she\u2019s been punished by life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to accept bad behaviour again but if you want to save your relationship with your wife & stepdaughter I think you do need to let her come back home. You & your wife need to sit down and have a discussion with her about how much what she did hurt and see if you can get to the bottom of why she did it. Also find out how she got into this state (maybe your wife can deal with that discussion). You should definitely set some ground rules for coming back & therapy should be one of them.", " NTA, your stepdaughter went power-crazy!\n\nShe was rude, cruel, and ungrateful to everyone just because she inherited some money; that shows her true colors. Moreover, after all this time, she didn't even offer an apology; she only reached out because she's out of money and expects everyone to rush to help her.\n\nAbsolutely no,  actions have consequences, and she needs to learn her lesson. I'm not saying to turn your back on her, but she has to work to earn your forgiveness, especially from her siblings.\n\nBefore even considering her return, certain boundaries need to be set, such as finding a job and contributing to household expenses, apologizing to her siblings, and repairing the things she damaged.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This would prevent any bad habits (such as drugs or a new, also homeless BF) she may have picked up from leaping into the OP's home without warning. It would also give the family time to assess her mental state better and give them privacy to discuss as a family what steps are appropriate going forward. I totally agree this gal has been given a dirty hand to play so early in her life, and therapy is probably an extremely good call.\n\nI'm so sorry you suffered some extremes in your life.

Knowing what young homeless women are at risk for is certainly reason enough for a parent to be utterly terrified for their child. I don't think she meant disrespect to her husband, I just think she acted on a frantic protective impulse/instinct.\n\nI agree with you about a contract, but it should also mandate therapy and a post-secondary education, even if just getting a job and paying for community college herself. She is young enough change can often happen, so best too use the leverage they have while they can.\n\nHOWEVER, I an VERY worried about the sudden personality change.

But I have lost far too many friends in my 20's to being thrown on the street. Gtg, starting to cry remembering...", "Oh, I so agree that the wife didn't likely intend to be inconsiderate. It would be terribly upsetting to contemplate one's child suffering out on the streets. But immediately retrieving her daughter was a strictly emotional response that precluded any discussion they might have been able to have about conditions the young woman should be expected to meet upon arriving at *their* home. I'm suggesting he use the time wisely to determine what the conditions will be in place going forward. This will allow his wife to continue to make emotion-driven decisions, supportive of her flailing daughter, and him to be the A who holds the veil for her to hide behind when the tough decisions have to be made in the future - because there's a lot of trouble coming their way with this formerly haughty, now distressed young woman.\n\nYou may be right about the young woman's mental stability. She's suffered some extreme losses when her Father died and again when her Grandmother passed, which likely made her feel \"old enough\" to air some grievances she's held about her life with OP and her Mother, and subsequent half-siblings since. Combining all those things with coming of age, she clearly she needs some guided structure she creates for herself now more than ever, and her mother is not likely to provide much good guidance while she's trying to re-mother her and nurse her wounds. She should definitely seek out some therapy if she continues to find her path to emancipation blocked by her grief or mental illness.", "There's a whole lot of past tense in that first paragraph.", "I think they were asking because they are curious what op's answer will be under the current circumstance.", "I'm sure the memories are terribly hard; I'm sorry.
