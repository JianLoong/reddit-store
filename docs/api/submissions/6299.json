MIL knows that daughter cannot stand this one meal, but still cooks it for every visit, including daughter's birthday, where I (42F) was not present and told her she could not have any birthday cake if she did clean her plate.  I told my daughter that if she cooked this dish again while we were visiting I would take her out to eat.  Sure enough, that was what she served on new year's day.  My daughter was offered an alternative of two slices of salami, so I took her out and her choice was a salad because she said she needed some fresh food.  MIL is now pissed that we don't appreciate her cooking, husband (41M, married 15+ years) refused to stand up to his mom and said daughter wouldn't starve if she missed a meal, SILs ganged up on us and said that everyone likes the dish but us.

Knowing your daughter didn\u2019t like that dish, your MIL is TA for making it on your daughter\u2019s birthday, and especially for threatening no cake unless her plate was clean. Your husband is also TA for not standing up for his daughter. No one *ever* should be told to clean their plate, let alone if it\u2019s something they don\u2019t like. Good for you for being a sane adult", "NTA. This behaviour from MIL and SILs is punitive, unwarranted and I can't see how it engenders the 'appreciation' MIL is looking for. The only thing your daughter would learn from being forced to eat a meal she doesn't like is that her preferences don't matter, speaking up might lead to rejection and to ignore what her body is telling her.

Lol :)\n\nLook, ultimately, nobody should force children to eat. It\u2019s how issues arise later. Your child sounds like she eats just fine, she simply hates this one dish. If MIL wants to make it all about her, so be it. Just tell her you can\u2019t be bothered to travel for 18 hours just to fight the same boring battles about her horrible meal. So, you decided to stay home and eat nice food instead.\n\nGood luck :)", "Additional comment.\n\nI just read out the *Enchilada Casserole* recipe to my husband.\nHe is literally horrified too lolololol his actual words were \u201coh Jesus.

Just reading it stimulated my gag reflex!", "Being able to politely decline food is a valuable skill in life, but that doesn't appear to be the issue here. Your MIL knows that your daughter really dislikes this meal, yet *insists* on not only making it but also in trying to prevent your daughter from having any reasonable alternatives to it. I mean... two slices of salami?\n\nPlus, I'm with your daughter. I try to be polite about food since it can be a deeply personal subject, and things like culture and socioeconomic status can play major roles in what and how a person cooks. But venison microwaved for 15 minutes with cream of chicken and cream of mushroom poured over some tortilla chips is.... I'm hesitant to call that cooking. A can of microwaved wet cat food sounds about as appealing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but the ILs (all of them are).  Can you suggest everyone going out to eat instead? If that does not work, have your daughter eat before you go there and/or pack snacks so she does not go hungry.", "NTA. I'd have done the same thing. MIL seems to be engaged in some weird and inappropriate power play with your daughter.", "NTA,  that is just nasty and lazy cooking.", "NTA. My mom cooked/served a couple of dishes for my father that I hated. I certainly didn\u2019t plan for it, but on separate occasions I became sick after eating one of those dishes (I was hospitalized about once a year as a child for what I now suspect was an autoimmune disorder). Miracle of miracles, I didn\u2019t have to eat those dishes any more.\n\nIf it reaches the point where a child is nauseated by a certain food or even vomiting after eating it, you\u2019ve definitely dithered too long.

I honest to god didn\u2019t even know you could microwave venison. \n\nBut there must be a way to handle this so that everyone can walk away happy.\n\nNext time you visit, plan ahead.
