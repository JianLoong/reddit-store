We were always strongly encouraged to TRY IT (still weren't forced to try it) and if we didn't like it, we didn't have to finish it or eat it next time it was made.\nBecause of this, to this day I will always try anything, I simply won't eat it again if I don't like it.", "I got my son to try more exotic foods by turning it into a wager. If he tried them but didn't like them, I'd take him to McDonald's for chicken mcnuggets, fries and a coke. He never got that fast food meal and he grew up to become a very adventurous eater.", "It's totally your fault, you should have had the sense to be born healthy! Duh!!   /s", "Me too. But I wouldn't feed that casserole to a dog.", "So did my inlaws, and I've complained for years that every meal is beef, potatoes and a salad. I swear I will never ever complain again.\n\nI also have an adventurous eater (she tries everything) and I read her mils 'meal' but I didn't even point out the venison or get to the point of the chips being added and she was already adamant that that bizarre concoction wouldn't even enter her mouth. NTA", "Farms ain't what they used to be... literally. When all you grow is industrial-scale corn, your cooking goes downhill too. Not trying to make assumption about what they grew up growing... that's just what I've seen", "I very much doubt everyone loves it. It looks far more like a show of control. It's easy to get someone to love good food, but getting everyone to eat bad food without complaining is a show of power."]}
