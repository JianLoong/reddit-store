My oldest son dropped out of high school during his senior year because he was 18 and didn't want to deal with it anymore. We were fine with the decision, as long as he got his GED AND found a job to support himself. \n\nWhat followed was a series of jobs that lasted a month or two before he quit. During this time, we were still supporting him. Housing, food, utilities, I was still washing his clothes even. About 6 months ago, he finally got a full time job that he really likes, and we told him he'd have to start paying $100 a week towards rent and utilities.\n\nHe was fine with that. Literally the only bill he has is for his cell phone and the weekly rent. He's still on my health insurance, driving our vehicle under our insurance. My husband had some pretty serious health problems that took him out of work for quite a while, so as a result we are struggling financially. That $100 from him is a huge help, especially with groceries.\n\nToday we got into a huge fight because he wants to get a vehicle that he's been making payments on transferred into his name today, so he wasn't going to pay the $100 this week. The issue is, he didn't say anything about it to me or his father, so I was counting on that money to use for gas to get myself back and forth to work since I get paid biweekly and it's my off week. My last check paid rent and groceries, and I am dead flat broke, so I'm screwed without that money.\n\nWhen I explained this, he flipped out, told me he hates me, I'm a horrible parent, why can't we just cut him a break? It's not fair that I expect him to pay rent, and a good parent would work with him because he's trying so hard. \n\nWe financially supported him for two years after he became a legal adult while he did nothing. Cleaned up after him, washed his clothes, fed him, and never asked for anything in return. Now we're barely making ends meet, my other kids are eating Mac and cheese and ramen every night because that's all I can afford while trying to keep a roof over our heads and the utilities on, I haven't eaten in two days because I can't stand the thought of taking food out of my children's mouths. \n\n(FYI: We don't qualify for any type of assistance because our state qualifies by gross total household income, and his income plus mine puts us over the limit. I've tried, I promise.)\n\nSo, am I really the asshole here? Am I being too sensitive? Because I'm so stressed out to begin with, I'm worried that I'm letting my hurt feelings keep me from seeing it objectively.", "created_utc": 1683129853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136rij0/aita_for_expecting_my_20_yo_son_to_pay_100_a_week/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an agreement and he is not keeping his part. I think in this case he should have thought about that earlier and at least notify you in advance that this is going to happen but as you are struggling financially i would say its a no-no anyway.", "NTA - tell him good luck finding a place to live all utilities and a vehicle included for $100 a week. \n\nIf the \u201ckid\u201d (because he\u2019s acting like one) can\u2019t see the $100 is helping feed his siblings and get gas in vehicles he\u2019s also incredibly self-centered.", "NTA. As I've said before on this sub, it is reasonable for adult children to expect some level of support from their parents if they are able to provide it, but it is also reasonable for parents to expect contributions to the household from their adult children. Your 20 year old son is not only freeloading, he backed out of your agreement.\n\nLet's be clear that $100/week (or about $450 a month) is more than reasonable. It's actually extremely generous for room, board, utilities, etc. The fact that he's returning your support and generosity with verbal abuse is absolutely something you should not have to put up with. I understand it's just this one week, but the fact that he's trying to skip this week's payment without warning you in advance in order to save himself some convenience is really not ok. The fact that he's happy to impose costs on you which you cannot afford while his parents and siblings go without adequate food is extremely alarming.", "Point out to him that it is his income that is stopping you getting financial help and you would be financially more stable without him living there. You don\u2019t want to ask him to leave but he may force your hand\u2026", "NTA for charging and holding him to a reasonable amount of rent.\n\nBut he hit adulthood not already doing his share of the laundry and cooking, and not cleaning up after himself.  Does he even do those things now 2 years into adulthood, or does he get a pass now because he works?  That's not how it will work when he's on his own - unless the plan is for him to find a partner to take over where mom and dad left off, which is terrible.\n\nThis attitude from him is *not* good, but really shouldn't come as a surprise.  The best time to address this would have been years ago.  The second best time is *now.*  Hold firm.  He owes you the rent.", "NTA\n\n\"Son, you are an adult. If you were living somewhere else, you would be paying far more. $100 a week is what your father and I have felt would be a meaningful contribution since you are living under our roof, eating our food, using our utilities, and using our insurance and car. That $100 a week makes a huge difference in how we get by, and it's not negotiable. We took care of you for the last two years, no questions asked, with no gratitude or payments - that was a kindness we extended you, but it cannot continue as it is. If you don't feel that $400 a month is fair, then you are welcome to find your own place at this point, but I have your siblings who are still minors to consider right now. if you cannot make your equal contribution as a adult in this household, then you will need to leave so that our expenses are lower. I'm setting the expectation now, because you have had two plus years to get on your feet and be independent, and you continue to make excuses for not in the very least making a fair contribution to the household.  We've been very generous in regards to your development after high school, but we cannot reasonably support you like that anymore with the current economy and our current situation. It also doesn't help that I cannot seek assistance because your income counts towards the household income, so unless you move out, I am unable to receive state assistance. Please come to a decision on how you would like to proceed by X date.\"", "NTA Kick his entitled, ungrateful ass out if he feels that strongly.", "NTA! $100 is nothing, and he needs to be reminded that he is now an adult and that his expenses would be much, much higher if he were to be living alone.", "NTA.\n\nFirst up I'm sorry that things are so tight for you that your struggling to keep everyone fed. No one should have to live like that. \n\nThe fact is that your sons income stops access to financial support that probably would be well over the $100 your asking for in rent. And as a result you cant eat and your kids are eating mac and cheese.\n\nI can tell your son is trying really hard and it doesn't sound like he's had things easy. You can and should absolutely be empathetic to his experiences but at the same time you need to set a boundary, you can not compromise on the rent.\n\nAre there any charaties that donate food and groceries that you could look into?\n\nAs a reference my parents own two houses and made me start paying an equal share in all groceries and bills once I had a fulltime job at 21. I wont do that with my kids, but I would if the family was in serious financial hardship.", "No, NTA, I think at worst you aren't framing this correctly.\n\nYour son's failure to keep his word meet his obligations that he committed, and to place his personal interests and wants first, is important because has an impact on others. And yes he didn't give advance notice. It's an adult lesson. He has to learn it.", "He will never find accommodations for $400/month.\n\nI know he doesn't deserve it,  but sit down with him and show him what it entails to run a household. \n\nDepending on where you live,  his rent could be in the thousands. Plus, he needs groceries,  utilities,  car payments,  insurance. Extra curriculars?  Forget it. Give him a dose of reality.  NTA.", "NTA. The real world does not cut you a break. This kid has no idea how good he has it.", "NTA - But are you absolutely sure that his income impacts your eligibility for benefits? Because he is not your spouse and you are not filing taxes jointly with him. He is essentially a tenant renting a room in your home.", "> so he wasn't going to pay the $100 this week.\n\nThe title is misleading. From this sentence it sounds like it was only one week that he wouldn't be able to pay.\n\nHowever, I'm going with NTA because he didn't inform you earlier so you could plan out your finances.", "NTA - rent doesn\u2019t \u201cpause\u201d just because you get another bill. Welcome to adulthood. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can move out. Where he\u2019ll end up paying more, and have stricter deadlines.\n\nThis is teaching financial responsibility.", "NTA - if he doesn\u2019t like it he can move out. I think he\u2019ll realize pretty quick 400$ a month to live at home is an amazing deal. Even if his full time job is minimum wage he should have enough for a phone bill, 400$/mo to you, and car payments for a used car.", "Y T A for propping him up to the point where he thinks he deserves housing, food, and insurance for $100 a month and then thinking he should get a pass if he has other priorities.", "18 is pretty young to be (even partially) responsible for the household. By all means have him contribute more fully to the physical upkeep (cooking, cleaning, maintenance etc). There\u2019s no reason why he shouldn\u2019t be doing his own laundry for example. Maybe that will also help you feel less stressed. \n\nHe should have told you about not giving the $100 this time but his brain is literally still developing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not IMO. The household income is the parents. He\u2019s not a dependent & is a separate entity from the household despite living there making his income separate. Personally I would kick him out & stop supporting him especially if you can\u2019t afford it. \n\nI would not have been supporting him dropping out either. Finishing out his final year of school while the gov\u2019t is paying for it is so much smarter than dropping out & then paying for it yourself.\n\nNTA & I would be enforcing some tough love here.

They don't judge and usually willing to help.", "Nta he can't have it both ways.  He can absolutely choose to drop out and not get a ged.  However, if he wants to be an adult then he gets to *be an adult*.  Including paying bills.", "NTA. \n\nPart of being an adult is being able to pay your own way through life. He has an obligation to 'pay where he stays'. No matter what his living situation is, he's not going to find one where he would be able to defer paying his rent and living expenses. That is the reality of adulthood. When he finally leaves your home, he's going to find that landlords aren't going to give a flying fig about whether he's trying hard or whatever else he has going on. His rent and utilities will still be due or he's going to be living in the streets. Period.\n\nWhen he chose to get the car, he needed to consider that he still has the obligation to pay the agreed upon rent.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and your son can clearly see that your family is struggling.

If so, then maybe it is time for him to find a roommate and a flat.", "I'd suggest that too. He can't have it both ways, play the \"I'm an adult!\" card and then expect to be kept like a kid. Let him move out and get his own place.

When we switched and now I just work full time, and as the only person working in my household, now we've been approved.\nThough I will say OP you might try again as requirements for foodstamps in the USA (if that's where you are) have changed to match inflation and rising rent/mortgage.", "I didn\u2019t google. Just my opinion on it; a kids money is separate from the parent money & they are considered a separate household despite still living with their parents.", "Right, but that was your partner! I had moved out but then moved back in with my parents at one point. I did not \"join their household\" as I was still paying all my own bills and for my own groceries. This is what the food stamps lady said. And I qualified. If he starts paying for his own groceries then he is the same as a tenant and both he and OP will qualify separately for foodstamps. If you live with 5 roommates you can apply for and qualify for foodstamps. Because they are roommates and they will not pay for your food. A partner is different."]}
