Countless times I\u2019m sure. Did they throw a big tantrum every time it happened?", "Its sooooo tough to live rent free and have a tonic water be drank by your dad once. Poor baby.", "Because she's living there rent free and not contributing for the household groceries. \n\nIt's not unreasonable or wild to say \"hey, you can either share or buy your own groceries.\"\n\nOps daughter isn't footing the household food bills, her parents are, shes also not paying rent. She has no problem grabbing food she didn't pay for.\n\nIf you throw a tantrum when you're getting free room and board over a fizzy water you need to truly reevaluate your fucking life. I'd give a shitton to be afforded the opportunity she's getting to save up. \n\nIf she wants to have agency and control, two of the three options are just that. Either buy your own food and feed yourself or move out.", "Roommates exist. Daughter wants the luxuries of being a kid with the freedoms of being an adult. Understandable that her parents don\u2019t have much tolerance for pacifying her desire for arrested development.", "So why isn't OP doing that already?", "You can effectively do both. It all depends on her wage and how much she is expected to contribute. In my family if we still lived at home, we paid \"board\" to my Mum if we had an income. It was around 20% of our fortnightly pay (it would cap at $200, you would never pay more than this amount). This left us with the other 80% for any other expenses. When I was making around $2000, it was definitely possible to save effectively with $1800 a fortnight. OP is asking for grocery money. Not her whole pay check.", "Because the time to address issues like this is the first time it happens.", "I think \"incredibly cruel\" is a bit of an exaggeration", "If its special for her self - at 22 she should be smart enough to mark it as such. I was a boomerang son. I lived with my parents for a while after school after having been gone 7 years. I bought food for the house all the time. I never would have dreamed of charging my parents for food that i bought - i was happy to have a place to live.  I have long since moved out.", "1. i don\u2019t think culture is the right word for what i\u2019m describing but i can\u2019t think of the right word right now\n2. i\u2019m saying this way of thinking and acting, whatever, is fucked up and shouldn\u2019t be so normalized\n3. i\u2019m also saying that OP is TA because of the way she\u2019s treating her child. acting like your children stop being your responsibility at 18yo is an asshole thing to do. again not a culture, used the wrong word", "I agree. I wouldn\u2019t dream of throwing a fit as a parent about my kid not wanting to share things she\u2019s bought for themselves especially during a time when they still don\u2019t have a lot of money and then making an ultimatum that I wouldn\u2019t provide food for them if they won\u2019t agree to not have anything of their own in the kitchen. What? Also how hard is it to ask if you can have some of somebody elses things?", "Pros buy drinks in bottles, because lids.", "threaten eviction not election. And yeah she gave her an ultimatum. Let us eat your food, Buy all your own food, or Move.\n\nSuch a sorry attitude to have towards your own child. And she's trying to take credit for putting her kid up and supporting her while she works. This is such an extreme abstraction from the reasonable response to this which would be to ask her to contribute a little bit of cash to family groceries.", "I'm bewildered by every top response here. The only prediction you can safely make is that the top voted answer will be the absolute most incorrect position.", "A \"graduated\" adult.", "Yep. Or those times Mom thought she\u2019d have a slice of cake after the last load of laundry or something and someone had come back for seconds, not leaving her any. Parents sacrifice a lot, things they don\u2019t even consider sacrifices, while their kids are growing.

I feel badly for people who don't have a family to help them get established. And I don't think living with your parents reduces your agency to being a child again. It's a rough transition for a lot of people.", "But they willingly offered to not charge her rent or grocery bills. If they're not willing to supply the house with what she eats, but also not willing to let her have her own, personally funded items, that's not in the nature of the agreement. I don't see that she threw a tantrum: the post says she was upset because this keeps happening, he apologized, OP changed the entire agreement on the spot. \n\nSomeone doesn't have to be suffering more than you in order to empathize with them.", "Why isn't OP forcing her daughter to buy all her own food? Probably because until her daughter was kind of a $#&@+ to her father OP was providing food to her for free.", "When I moved back in with my mom we did the same thing but reversed. She paid utilities (except cable) and I bought groceries. Whatever I bought was for both of us to share. If she wanted something in particular I\u2019d buy it and do the same if there was something I wanted.

I also help kept the house, and I was excluded from any family trips (they brought my sister along, wasn't a couples trip) and I would stay and watch their pets. I had 0 issues with this and was grateful to be able to save more money than if i was renting alone. I also paid 100 percent of my own college tuition. Entitled idiot I am, aren't I? \n\nThis girl is 22. Yes she's a grown ass adult and it'd be nice if she could chip in. Once shes on her own she'll understand how hard it can be to support a house hold. \n\nOn the flip side, if my child bought his own special water I wouldn't touch it. If my significant other brought home a beer he wanted to try I'd ask if I could have one. I'm willing to bet if someone asked this girl if they could have one of her waters she'd probably say sure. It's the lack of asking that's uncool.", "Tonic water stales fast... Pros buy the little glass bottles with pry off lids that are one drink per bottle, because the fizzy doesn't last in the big plastic bottles you van reclose.", "Pros buy cans of tonic that already have the gin in them. \n\nThey buy them from Marks & Spencer because M&S cans of gin and tonics are doubles for the same price as other cans that only have a single measure of gin.\n\nSource: me feeling a bit squiffy after 3 cans of G&T from M&S Simply Food and being confused enough to read the label.", "Yeah, I can imagine their dad working hard all week, goes to make himself a drink to relax and gets told off by his 22 year old daughter. Their daughter needs to learn empathy and start thinking about others, especially those that are still working hard to keep a roof over their head, feed them, and are probably still doing their laundry.", "I see. I should have budgeted for the nonsmoker. Sorry about that. I'm off to go kick an addiction while I'm under more stress than usual.", "Lol, I can understand the drama for that one.", "She's a full grown adult with a full time job with zero major expenses. \n\nI'm well aware of the ecominc shit sandwich the middle class has been eating the past 40 years. That has nothing to do with brat behavior.\n\nShe's clearly still very immature if a damn tonic water is worth throwing a fit over and pushing her very generous mother over the edge because this isn't the first time she's acted like a spoiled child.\n\nPoor baby.", "Listen, I get it. I can see why Ops kid is upset. I can also see why Op is upset.\n\nSure, it sucks for the daughter OP decided to change the terms of the quite literal massive financial boon they're offering, but she's fucking 22, and a mini-fridge is like 50 bucks, and could have prevented all of this drama. \n\nBuying all her own food with the guarantee that it won't be touched isn't capital punishment. In fact, out of the options, I think it's the most fair. \n\nHaving to share because she contributes zero monetarily to the home is also not a big deal. \n\nIf OP was like \"Fuck you, get out of my house\" it would be different, but she gave her pretty fair choices to a full ass adult living under her roof for free.", "Mmmm Fever tree tonic. Best G&T around.", "The best time to kick that addiction was before it became an addiction. The 2nd best time is now."]}
