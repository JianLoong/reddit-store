Either you're okay with the arrangement of her staying with you rent-free and not contributing to groceries, or you need to reevaluate this. But don't steal her stuff. Just because she lives in your house doesn't mean she has no right to her own property. This is no different than you stealing other stuff from her like clothes or jewellery. \n\nYou don't get to play the saint for housing her for free, but then demand payment by stealing from her or taking away her right to own anything. Then you need a more official agreement cause this backhanded payment you're demanding is not fair to her. She buys food for herself to make sure it's there, when she needs it, and you denamd to eat it out from under her? What if you bought something for a special occasion, but when you need it, you find out someone has just taken it? Would you think that was totally okay?

She also sounds like at least a tiny bit spoiled and now needs the reality check.

When you\u2019re living with peers and sharing food fully, it would be EXTREMELY rude for the person shopping to refuse to buy the foods that one person likes. You admit that you do this with some of the foods your daughter wants in the house. Your daughters solution is to buy those things herself.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re not the parent and in this parental mindset, you are the one in the wrong at this point. You were supposed to buy all the food for the house and you didn\u2019t, so someone had to go out and get their own. Oh well, no big deal. \n\nBut since this person knows you\u2019ll never get them the food they want, they know they have to keep going out to supply that. Nobody else in the house has this issue; the shopper shops for the things that everyone else likes, after all. So when someone else eats something from her supply, your daughter knows it\u2019s up to her to replace it. She already shouldn\u2019t need to replace it according to your deal (which was that you buy all the food, and the household all shares), but YOURE already breaking said deal. \n\nYour daughter doesn\u2019t begrudge her father drinking a tonic water. She begrudges the fact that you, for some reason, maintain that she stock her own food (ostensibly because only she likes it, which we know isn\u2019t true as other household members would like some too) and then treat it as if you stocked it.\n\nOP, what is this weird dominance game you\u2019re in with your daughter? Why don\u2019t YOU buy THE WHOLE FAMILY some tonic water? Do you harbor judgement over the food you want her to eat? Do you really care about the food at all, or are you looking for your daughter to feel guilty, grateful, or ashamed instead?\n\nWhy have all this drama when you could just have a shopping list that everyone gets to add to, and then someone gets to buy. It doesn\u2019t even have to be you! Let the whole household contribute to BOTH the effort and the decision.", "My grown daughter shares my house. The only way that it works is for you to ask before taking something that you know that you didn't buy. It's fucking food. Imo not a hill to die on.", "ESH: If she has special things she likes to eat and buys them with her own money she should have a reasonable expectation that no one else consumes them without asking. If she had a special shampoo she bought and other people used it she'd have a right to be upset. Same for foodstuffs. It would be nice if she thought about sharing. She is living in your house rent free and you pay for all her other groceries. A thoughtful person would think about the others in her household, not just herself. She's 22 and just has her first job?\n\nShe could though keep it in her room in a small refrigerator. That way it's out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the family.\n\nIf your family likes her special items you could add them to the weekly grocery shopping so everyone could enjoy.", "YTA.  She should be allowed to spend her own money on drinks or food items she enjoys, especially if it\u2019s not on your grocery list. It sounds like family members are just taking her stuff without asking.

It's about her having things she likes. Rather than asking you to buy her the things she likes she's buying it herself. I mean that's a good thing isn't it? \n\nYour daughter is 22 and is a very young adult. There's. Othign wrong if you want to charge her a small amount of rent, just know every dollar she gives you it'll take her longer to move out. If you want her to be independent sooner (especially in this shit economy) leave her snacks alone.", "YTA. She's learning to shop and budget. Teach her instead of throwing her out. Come up with a plan for replacing what's taken and have her contribute to the overall food budget. If anyone in the family wants to spend money on a treat for themselves, that should be respected.", "Yta,\nYou are a grown person and it sounds like in the first conversation about this you went nuclear.   \n\nSit down, explain to her that she has free accommodations, and if she has something she doesn't want to share, she should leave it in her room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
