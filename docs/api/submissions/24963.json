Definitely a life lesson to be learned here.", "**Sorry, but YTA.** When someone buys something for themselves, it\u2019s normal to ask, if you can eat it. When my parents buy something special that doesn\u2019t look like something that is normally in the fridge (idk some special cheese etc), I ask them, if I can eat it. When I buy something special for myself, they ask me if they can take it. (Usually they don\u2019t take things I buy because they want me to enjoy it if I bought it for myself to eat - isn\u2019t that what good parents normally do???) When she\u2019s getting upset about someone taking her food, it must be reocurring situation. So imagine she buys something she is looking forward to eat -> it gets eaten -> she have to buy it again -> it gets eaten etc. This is not about money at all, it\u2019s about that she is looking forward to eating snack she likes - that is why she bought it - and you just take it without asking so she doesn\u2019t get to take it. And instead of communicating about it or asking her if you can take her food - because you know she has a problem with it, you give her options and one of them is to move out??? Like excuse you? I don\u2019t know if this is only American thing, but where I\u2019m from, my parents were never concerned about me eating food they buy. And we are not even middle class.

If you're the one with the grocery budget and doing all the shopping,  are you asking for special requests before you go and making sure to get the items for the house that everyone is wanting? If the tonic water is something that is never in the house unless she buys it for herself, it's reasonable for her to expect to at least be asked LIKE AN ADULT before someone takes her things. Same with the other foods. If it's not being provided for her because she's your child, then she paid for it, it's hers, she isn't required to share if she doesn't want to, and for you to start tossing out ultimatums because you guys were STEALING her stuff is wrong. She's an adult. She wanted something, so she bought it with her money. She should be able to reasonably expect to get to keep her items and determine their use. Provide a spot for her to keep her food items she wants for herself that she pays for", "what the fuck?\n\nYTA obviously. how hard is it just to ask her if you can have sone of her stuff? how would you feel if you bought yourself a special treat and she\u2019d eaten it all?", "YTA. You started off saying she could to save money. Now, your going directly against that.", "YTA and you seem pretty damn controlling at that, stop eating your daughters snacks. You say its tough out there so you're trying to help her out, but your drawing this weird line at her not wanting the food she bought to be taken from her without anyone even asking? Hell your husband wasn't even mad so why are you throwing your little fit about this?", "YTA- having shared groceries doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t also buy herself things she expects to be able to have of her own. You\u2019re buying basics so she has food, she\u2019s buying anything extra she wants and treats.", "Hi OP, college student here. As gently as I can, I\u2019m gonna say YTA. The problem isn\u2019t her getting upset at the food being taken, her dad already worked that out with her when he tried to apologize for taking the drink. The issue is that you escalated the situation right after because you\u2019re not understanding your daughter is still living in student/dorm mode.\nRemember, she JUST graduated. She lived in the dorms and spent a lot of time on campus. In the dorms, food is sacred. Groceries that were previously announced as for sharing are fine, but you never touch food that was not expressly bought for sharing. You never know if someone bought exactly what they needed in order to stay in their budget or if they\u2019re planning out their meals. That\u2019s just what many students consider the fair thing to do while living away from home and with others. It\u2019s student life.\nShe\u2019s probably frustrated that you don\u2019t understand that because in college, pretty much everyone understands that. There\u2019s no \u201cwe\u2019re your parents/family so get over it\u201d in college. In fact, telling someone to get over taking something they got specifically for themselves is one of the most rude things you can say, from what I experienced. So it comes off that you don\u2019t have empathy for the mindset she had to develop as a student while being among her peers long-term. Especially since one of the options you gave her was \u201cgive us access to your treats or pay for everything yourself\u201d when it sounds like you won\u2019t include the things she likes to enjoy regularly in the house groceries that you explicitly buy for sharing anyway. And I will be honest, it seems strange not to add them to the list since the rest of you seem to like some of those things as well. That\u2019s my take on things.\nIf the situation is what I suspect, there\u2019s a couple things you can do. I think you guys should honestly just include the stuff she likes in the house groceries so she doesn\u2019t have reason to buy separately in the first place. Then there\u2019s no \u201cyours vs. mine\u201d only \u201cours\u201d. It\u2019ll be a good way to get her used to sharing communally again. Or if you find that unnecessary you can just replace things that she\u2019s bought when you\u2019ve dipped into them. Just some suggestions.", "Why not just get a mini fridge in her room for her special stuff?", "I went vegan while I was still living with my grandparents and later my parents, and I'm trying to remember if I ever felt conflict with them eating my food. We would often share meals, and I would cook for the family using the special ingredients I bought (non-dairy milks, miso, etc.), but other days, they would cook. Usually they'd set aside part of the meal as vegan, and I think I never minded if they used my ingredients from the fridge/pantry. If I got myself a special snack, I'd stash it in my room. \n\nMaybe my family was a little different than OP's, as we'd share meals together even once I was an adult, but I almost feel like both OP and her mom are making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. There has to be a middle ground. Some people have suggested the daughter having a mini-fridge for their special foods, and that seems helpful to me.", "I honestly agree with this comment.

That way, someone doesn't get their treat eating they have been craving. It is just polite family behavior in my house.", "Thank you!!! OP is the one throwing a fit here, not the daughter. Not eating someone else's food is a very simple boundary to respect. Honestly. For her to be that upset over that boundary being broken, as well, makes me incredibly suspicious of just what boundaries OP's daughter has been able to set and had respected while growing up. 'Cause it doesn't sound right here.", "This is what I was thinking too. You don't just get upset over something this small if it's not happening over and over. I'd like to think she's not so shallow she really cares about the tonic water or whatever, but more of a reminder that she can't have anything for herself because of her situation. She could already be anxious and being down on herself and these little things feel like the straw on the camels back for her. \n\nI was a little like this when I first went back to living at home. I packed my lunches for work so I would buy my own groceries to make the meals, and depending on what the meal was/how expensive the items were sometimes I only bought enough for a small portion.  This created some issues because I was in a \"make enough for everyone\" kind of household. If somebody ate or used the ingredients I bought for a specific recipe, I had to go out to the store again which was tiring on top of meal prep. If the things OP's daughter is buying are for her to make lunches or whatever her food preferences are, why is everyone else eating them? \n\nI also like to try new recipes and be adventurous with food, while my parents do not. My dad would nitpick and criticize whatever I was making a lot, see me eating it, want to try some and then realize it was actually good and ask why I didn't make more. This cycle was continuous and aggravating at times. I also had family at one point who would eat off the lunches I had packed without asking and I would get to work and find half my plate empty. \n\nI think my frustration also came from the fact that I wasn't meeting my own expectations. Even though my parents were happy to have me at home *I* felt as if I had failed personally by not getting a well paying job immediately after college. The food thing was just another sign of my lack of control over the whole situation, so sometimes my reactions were overblown. My parents tread much more carefully now and my dad always asks before eating.", "Yes, thank you for this! I've been an adult child living at home. Granted, I was paying rent, and it was explicitly in the agreement that part of the money went towards household groceries and I could eat the common food. But my schedule was very different than everyone else's and I would often buy treats or packaged foods for my work lunches and cook extra food to have leftovers for lunches or quick dinners after work... and I got upset when other people would eat them. \n\nInstead of treating this as unreasonable, my family worked together on the problem. I got better at labeling my special foods and putting them in specific places so people would know they were mine (and bringing home or making treats for my family occasionally), my dad and brothers got better at respecting my property, and my mom added some things to the grocery list she didn't know other people would like (and tried to replace some of the more expensive things I lost). \n\nHaving special foods NOT be there when you've been counting on them or looking forward to them really sucks. It's more than just the monetary value of the food. It's the respect.", "Some people just have a weird ass idea of what sharing one\u2019s personal purchases is vs shared purchases for everyone. No need to have everyone buy their own separate bread (unless they eat a whole loaf at once and never leave any) but if someone buys themselves a specific item, you ask if you can have some, and don\u2019t use a yes as an excuse to take all of it. If daughter is trying to save, that plus her age/new graduate status probably means she\u2019s limited in what she can treat herself to, between (probably) student loans, which only have a few months of forbearance before they start demanding payment, and shit pay from most entry level jobs (and the ever increasing price of food). For someone to get that upset over a tonic water, I\u2019d either guess they are under a lot of stress, feel like they\u2019re throwing what they allow themselves to spend for personal wants away because everyone else takes but never replaces, or both. I still ask my partner of ten years if I can have a cookie if they bought a box before coming home from work, or even if it was bought on a normal grocery trip but I know he likes them a lot, but I don\u2019t need to ask permission to have some bread for a sandwich. It works because we\u2019re adults who do adult stuff like communicate.

It means you find a way for things to work in the household that makes sense.

I say it's irrelevant because xyz, you say xyz doesn't make it irrelevant because abc. You still missed the majority of the comment though lol\n\nNow I'm going to say abc doesn't factor in because...\n\nYou don't know what her expenses are, so it's really weird to assume she has zero. You know they buy her groceries and they don't charge her rent along with presumably utilities and Wi-Fi. She might pay insurance, car payments, loans, not to mention just whatever shit she just buys: outings, clothing, etc. But none of that matters because what she does and doesn't buy isn't the point.\n\nThe point is, like I said, fair, agreed-upon, and clear. A water bottle being taken from her is an expense. Like I said, if you're paying for her groceries and rent to save her money, it doesn't make any sense to then charge her by arbitrarily taking her property in any random moment or amount.\n\nHow little the water bottle costs is beside the point.\n\nActually, I'll add in a new argument as well: this has very little to do with money, that was just the most obvious way to argue it because it's quantifiable (parents give her rent $1000+ groceries $100 and then take groceries $5, it doesn't make any sense). The main issue here is respect and expectation. If they have a family shopping list where anything can go on it, then anyone who wants anything can simply have it via that list. Why, then, would there be any need to take anything else? If the girl went to the store and got 4 water bottles, then the expectation is to have 4 water bottles ready for her and her alone. If anyone else wanted that, they could have had it. Taking that bottle is taking her time and routine and destroying it, so now she doesn't have what she had the fair expectation to have. Additionally, what is, by all rights, hers, is being taken away when there's little reason to take it from her other than to establish some kind of dominance, which is ridiculous, the same way it would be ridiculous to go into her closet and take a shirt out.\n\nBareminimum respect would require someone to check whose bottle it is and see if it's ok to drink it. Actual genuine consideration for someone you love and have a vested interest in their well-being would require you to see how many there are and how much they cost and how much the person values them, and make a judgement call to restrict yourself from even asking. Because again, why are you getting a bottle that someone got for themselves, above and outside of the normal grocery process, for yourself, particularly when you're housing them so they can save money? It's downright childish to even want it. Would they even want it if they didn't see it? Because that's how a child acts, a child wants whatever they see and doesn't consider anything else except their own interests.", "How did I miss the majority of the comment?

You didn\u2019t really make a point at all.\n\nYou also don\u2019t know what kind of expenses she has, so it\u2019s weird to assume.

I live in Asia so it\u2019s normal live at home rent free BUT I very rarely purchase things for myself and tend to \u201chide\u201d it as my brother finishes it so fast that there was once that I was so pissed as I haven\u2019t open it and when I wanted to, it\u2019s missing..he learned from it and to not touch my things without asking as a packet of potato chips can last him less than or around 30 mins\ud83d\ude44\n\nI do purchase things that I don\u2019t mind sharing but asking before taking is always nice and respectful.\n\nIf OP had talked to her before moving in or she turned 21 etc. then I would say the daughter is the A H but if no conversation were made prior to this, then OP\u2019s the A H. If the things she purchase are on the expensive end + something she does not purchase regularly, I totally get her. Also the rate of consumption should be made known as going to through it let\u2019s say less than 3 days can be a reasonable reaction on the daughter\u2019s end. Daughter should purchase a mini fridge that can be around $30 or something to keep her things separate but OP and others should avoid taking anything from it unless informed.", "Breaking down and crying over tonic water tells me shes stressed af and this prob isnt about tonic water.", "Food protective. I don't hear about that in healthy relationships.", "Yes, though she should pay for it. If the daughter wants her own food stash then she can get a fridge and keep it separately.", ">The reason that you don\u2019t continue to support your kids after a certain amount of time ( like after they graduate from college, which this girl did) is because they tend not to treat their parents and family members very well\n\nLOL many cultures around the world would vehemently disagree", "I think it depends on the frequency. It's one thing if this is how she reacts after someone uses a tiny bit of it, but it could very well be that she brings home sandwich meat then finds a third of it gone because mom decided to make everyone a couple sandwiches each with it", "You're being down voted and it's so unfair. Just because the parent is the big one doesn't mean they get to disrespect their kids because they're younger. In this case the daughter is 20, but the parent is much older than her. Op is a bully. YTA", "I'm disabled, so my mum typically comes over two afternoons a week to help me with jobs around the house, my parents drive me to medical appointments, and occasionally, they come and pick me up to take me for dinner at their house (I usually stay the night).\n\nOn Wednesday, I had a blood test at 11.30, and an abdominal ultrasound at 4. I wasn't allowed to eat for 12 hours prior to the ultrasound, but my mum would be at my house during lunchtime and needed to eat (usually she comes after lunch).\n\nShe offered to bring a sandwich, but I said I was happy to feed her for a change, so I bought Houmous, Whipped Feta, Baby Cucumbers, Baby Peppers, Carrots, Cherry Tomatoes, and Olives, with Aprium/Plumcot for after (I prepped enough veg for both of us, and after she had eaten as much as she wanted, popped the rest in a tub in the fridge to eat when I got back from the ultrasound).\n\nIf I have Ice Cream or desserts, I share them with my parents during their visits.\n\nI don't have a lot of money, but feeding people is one of my love languages (I used to be a chef) and I want to show them some appreciation for all they do for me.", ">Put your name on it.\n\nHa. \n\nThis never made a difference in my house. I would do this and my parents told me I was being selfish and then everyone else would take my stuff anyway.", "It's not just buying things for yourself it's the time you had to spend to buy it it's the time you had to spend preparing it.", "Yup. My mom liked to buy these small containers of chocolate puddings that came in 2 packs. I never took them without asking cause I knew that was her treat.", "     The parents are buying all of the food and paying for all her basics already that's the difference.\n     We're not talking about a child here, we're talking about a 22 year old college graduate, who's living rent free with all needs paid for whining and crying about a snack.", "Or the people she lives with could have some common decency to realize that they buy household goods yet didn't buy these things, so it's probably worth asking the person who did, if they can have some.", "I\u2019m DYING this burn is *gold*!!!\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80", "Sorry about that. I don't think its right what happened to you, but it works for us. All families are different, but I think some respect is needed, and I fell for you that you didn't receive it.", "As an adult, I now understand that my parents both are incapable of setting and respecting boundaries. So it makes sense that they didn't care about mine.\n\nStill sucks though. I think your system is a good one.", "Imagine they are flatmates, one person is spending \u00a31000 a month supporting another and that person then has spare cash to buy expensive treats for themselves as a result.\n\nThey then get pissy that that the people paying for almost everything get tempted and help themselves to the od treat too.\n\nIts not OK to live off of other people and impact their standard of living and then use the money you've saved due to them to live a better standard of living that them.  You are supposed to be saving up so you can leave, and if you've got money for treats then the least you can do is share with others. \n\nIF she was paying a notional level of rent that meant everyone has a better standard of living due to her living with them, then that would be different.", "well parents are parents after all", "Gin and tonic with a slice of lemon.", "This is the best comment I read so far!!!!", "I do actually have a vape! I use it in the car. \n\nIt's complicated. It's part of our relationship and an opportunity for low-stakes bonding in a way. She doesn't smoke when I'm not around her, and if we're not in *some* sort of activity, she feels the need to fill the silence. So it's sort of a low price to pay? I feel conflicted about it, both feeling stingy and feeling the stress of the expense. But if I really had no money, I would actually choose the vape. (hugs if you want them. I appreciate your suggestions)", ">not wanting to share food.\n\nIt's not that she doesn't want to share food though, that would be fine. The problem is that she expects them to share *their* food but doesn't want to share hers. The options she is being given are that everybody shares or nobody shares, but it can't keep being one-sided. I don't see why you think that's unreasonable or treating her like a child. If I had an adult stranger as a lodger and they used my stuff but complained about me using anything of theirs then I would give them the same ultimatum.", "Gin & Tonic. The OG anti-malarial medication.", "Are you kidding me? Fever Tree's ginger beer is probably the worst I've ever tasted!", "Yes agree to disagree. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "your kidding have you seen the prices now a days. are you in denile and that's not the point, the point is it's her stuff SHE BOUGHT why should she share. why shoudl it be either by all your food, or give us your food you by for yourself or move out...do you understand how stupid that is.", "Yes I have seen the prices these days I grocery shop for myself every week and it's $150 at most. Maybe if you're ordering Uber Eats for every meal it's $300, but that's a stupid decision on your part."]}
