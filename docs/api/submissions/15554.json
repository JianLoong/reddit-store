We have 2 pairs, one in front of the other. My 11 year old and her friend took the row in front, and my 16 year old and I went to sit in our seats and found an older lady was in my seat. I said \u201cexcuse me, I think you are in my seat\u201d and showed her my ticket. At first she tried to claim I was in the wrong row. Then I asked to see her tickets and she pulled them out and she had two singles in different rows, but not THAT row. She said someone switched with her so she could sit next to her granddaughter (who was 8ish). And was clearly not going to move. I am not sure if she was confused or if she was thinking I would give up and go find another seat. I started looking for an usher and then the people in back of us took pity on her and moved around so they could sit together a couple of rows back. That was nice of them, and certainly not required. \n\nAs we were taking our seats, another older woman in the row behind said \u201cyou should have let her sit by her granddaughter.\u201d I was sort of flabberghasted and said \u201cI have a kid, too, and two more in the row in front of me, I\u2019m not leaving them alone.\u201d And she said \u201cwell, still, you should have let them sit together.\u201d My son and I just turned around and sat down in our seats and ignored her.   If it was just a matter of moving down one seat or something, I might have offered. But both my kids have anxiety, the younger one had a guest I was responsible for, and my son literally had tried to take his life 3 days prior. He was on 24/7 supervision. Hell no was I going to leave him to sit in a random single. But I\u2019m certainly not going to say any of this to the nosy old lady. \n\nAnd even if none of these things were true, is it wrong to want to sit in the seats I paid for? That grandma should have probably gotten 2 tickets next to each other, as I did. If not, maybe she could have had an usher help her find empty seats or exchange the tickets for two next to each other. It has bothered me all day. I\u2019m pretty sure she was in the wrong, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself.

Why should you have to sit in a different seat that you paid a certain price just so two strangers can sit together, either due to their poor planning or because they wanted to only pay a cheaper price? Doesn't make sense, isn't your responsibility or obligation, and considering you had so many kids to watch, certainly moving would have been irresponsible. \n\nI really also dislike people who expect red carpets to be pulled out for them just because they are old. Being old doesn't give anyone the right to be treated better than others.", "NTA\n\nYou sit in the seat you paid for.  It\u2019s not your fault they didn\u2019t get seats together AND not your fault she still sat in the WRONG seat. \n\nYou don\u2019t even have to justify it.", "NTA. The first sentence of your last paragraph really hits the nail on the head. It\u2019s not at all your responsibility to correct someone else\u2019s mistake. She should\u2019ve talked to someone who worked in the box office to see if they had any holds that had been unclaimed or unsold seats they could take to be together. People get paid to solve these problems, and you aren\u2019t one of them.", "NTA\n\nIf you're ever in this situation the simplest thing to say to the person interfering is \"okay, if you're fine with it why didn't you offer to swap seats with them?\" Strangely enough that's usually the end of it.", "NTA.  If that grandma wanted to sit next to her granddaughter, she should\u2019ve bought adjacent seats, not expect strangers to accommodate her.", "NTA. Even if you were alone, without kids, and she were in your spot then you are still entitled to the seat you picked. She should have bought seats together. Sure in that case, as a single person, it\u2019s a nice thing to let her sit by her granddaughter but you are in no way obligated to sacrifice due to her lack of planning.", "NTA, you had kids with you too.", "NTA - even if it were just you and your partner, they are your seats.", "NTA. You paid for those seats. If they don\u2019t want to sit in the seats they paid for it\u2019s their problem not yours. Same can be said if you were on a plane or anywhere else you have to buy a ticket with assigned seats.", "NTA and you don't even have to explain yourself. The older woman trying to guilt you into that was way out of line. You bought tickets that came with certain seats, so they are yours to use. End of story.", "NTA. The older woman, ignorant of all your details about anxiety and so on, was nevertheless butting in. Not quite like airplane or train seats, theatre seats are a notch up, because of the shared experience about to be enjoyed with your family/friends. They are chosen and purchased in advance; to arrive and demand other seats (for whatever reason) is rude, as any etiquette book will advise. In short, you paid for those seats.", "NTA. You bought the tickets for those seats. They're yours. She sold have tried to work something out with someone in the ticket booth or ushers and not be putting anything on you. \n\nYou're totally NTA.", "NTA.  This is why you book your tickets as early as you can if you (very understandably) want to sit with your companions.  Even if you\u2019d been there with an able bodied, neurotypical adult who required no supervision or assistance, you weren\u2019t required to move.  It\u2019s a nice thing to do, which means it\u2019s going above expected norms.  I suspect that woman made up the person who supposedly gave her your seat, so you would feel extra pressure to not insist on having the spot you paid for.  She should have approached an usher and asked if they could help her, not tried to make you give up your seat.", "NTA.  You did everything right.", "NTAH, she should have bought adjacent seating if she was going with a minor just like you had. She didn\u2019t plan ahead and that\u2019s on her, not you. I wouldn\u2019t have given up my seat either if I had my children surrounding me like you did.", "NTA\n\nGlad you held firm.", "NTA.  You paid to have those seats and needed to keep them for reasons that are your own.  You don't need to justify your choice and standing your ground.  Those that judged you need to check themselves.  They have no idea what your situation is and need to keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA\n\nAt all. In the slightest.", "NTA.\n\nI don't care if it's theater seats or airline seats, you paid for them, so the other person's issues are not your problem.  End of story.", "NTA.", "The AH here is the lady that had no context on a situation but felt it her obligation to talk down and belittle you which has been making you feel bad and question yourself. You did nothing wrong and that woman should mind her business and not say unnecessary things especially when the situation had resolved itself and did not need an outsider input. NTA.", "NTA, and that woman poking her nose in deserved only two possible responses: \u201cNo\u201d and  \u201cMind your own business\u201d. Personally I\u2019d have been tempted to swap those out for \u201cFuck off\u201d and \u201cDid I ask for comments from the background extras?\u201d but maybe not at a theatre. \n\nYour seats. You sit in them. You don\u2019t have to justify that in any way.", "No. You had 4 tickets together and needed to be with your kids.\n\nWhen I was little our seats on the train were double booked. I was 2, my sisters were 5 and 7. The conductor thought it would be okay to seat my sisters in another car..\n\nWe ended up sitting together in the dining car because mom refused", "NTA. \n\nI feel like it is basic courtesy to do at a bit of musical chairs, but I'd only \\*expect\\* you to agree if the results would leave you--for example--as close to your kids as you were before, maybe to the front or the side instead of behind. Basically, only an asshole would refuse a scenario where everyone wins and no one loses.\n\nBut this was a scenario where there'd be a winner and a loser, and in that case... no, you get to keep your seat.", "YTA. There is nothing wrong with politely asking someone to switch seats but just sitting there and assuming they will go away is terrible behaivour.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
