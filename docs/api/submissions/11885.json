My daughter is 21, and I've been a single mother most of her life, with occasional visits from my ex-husband. I have always wanted my daughter to be independent and to do what is best for her. I was not raised with religion and am agnostic/atheist leaning.\n\nMy daughter is in college, which I am happy to pay for. She got a boyfriend 7 months ago, whom I haven't met yet, but she spoke well of him.\n\nSo she showed up at my door with her boyfriend, who was wearing a suit, and introduced himself.\n\nI invited them in, served coffee and tried to get him to talk so I could get to know him better. He immediately started talking about how much he loved my daughter and how much he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and asked for my blessing. I thought this was strange, this boy just walked into my house and asked me to marry my daughter? I hardly knew his last name and I do not care about blessings, but they are too young.\n\nHe started saying that he would provide for her, that his family was a good, God-loving family, that they were well-off, that she wouldn't have to study or work, and that I would benefit from joining them. He said that traditions were important to him, that their future children would have a nice private education, that we could join their religious community, and that the wedding would be in a nice church in the middle of nowhere.\n\nFirst, I'm surprised that such a young boy could be so deeply religious, sounds like my grandfather's crazy friends, second, my daughter wouldn't study or work? No, I didn't raise my child to be a barefoot, cleaning, cooking, pregnant trophy wife. As much as I do not care about parental blessing, I have actively refused it and explained my reasons very well. I am paying for her education and letting it go to waste, and I want my daughter to be her own person and not a doormat.\n\nThe BF was silent, stood up, thanked me and left with my daughter.\n\nLater the next day she called me crying and screaming. She said she had tried to get her father's blessing and he had also refused. She accused me of conspiring against her happiness, and her boyfriend said he wouldn't marry into a family that doesn't know God, and that I was ruining her life.\n\nI dont know why she wants this kind of life, but her boyfriend looks and sounds sketchy AF, but I wonder if I should have left her alone. Am I the asshole? Did I ruin this for everyone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I called my Ex. He is notorious for being an asshole. He said that when our daughter introduced his boyfriend to him said \"Well done sweetie, you found a man conceived by inbreeding\". Of course, the BF was offended, but still tried to present himself as a gentleman. My ex kept mocking him by asking how many girls he keeps in the basement, and told him \"You will end up in a documentary someday boy, and you won't like it\". Then rejected the blessing and proposal. You can maybe see why I divorced him, that attitude brings nothing but trouble, but at least he scared the boyfriend away. I expressed my concerns that he might try to isolate her from us, he said that would go to that little church of him and kidnap our daughter back. The worst part, I think my Ex might do that, getting him into trouble, but he is being protective... I guess? Oh, and he made him confess that is a mormon. When I spoke to the BF he just said they are a god loving family.

Man, I get that a lot as an atheist.", "NTA - Considering she lived with you all her life, your daughter HAD to know about your lack of relgious leanings.  I strongly suspect she was lying to this person and was hoping it would slide past.  She's likely already fallen into whatever rabbit hole he was recruiting her for, but I have to say I'm surprised that he backed away.

Even without all the weird religious stuff, I can\u2019t imagine giving my blessing to someone I had literally just met, or to someone my child hasn\u2019t even known for a year. Without an established relationship, your blessing would be totally meaningless.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d tell them if he wants your blessing, you need time to get to know him, and spend time with them as a couple. They are adults and don\u2019t need your permission, but if it\u2019s important to them, then they can wait a bit longer.", "NTA \n\nI am somewhat religious and wouldn't give my blessing to someone like that. All kind of bad vibes.

But perhaps don't use the excuse of 'too young' as I'm sure she can do the math too.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou kid is in a cult.", "So I'm going to say this as a Christian man who got married only a few years ago and went to my wife's parents to ask for their blessing: you were right to say no, NTA\n\nA touch of context before I go further. I'm not from America, my country has Judeo-Christian values underlying society, but the population is about 50/50 secular to religious. We also don't really have that social pressure to be \"religious\", so people who say they are actually are and aren't just paying lip service, which is great as it means people actually take their own faith seriously.\n\nAs far as \"religious\" people treating women as less than men, they tend to base this in some old testament laws regarding treating women, such as if you wanted a wife you bought her from her father. Now, this does sound incredibly backwards, and treats women as second class citizens, people conveniently \"forget\" the context. This was written at a time when women were treated as third class citizens, when if you wanted a wife you just abducted her. These laws were meant to improve things and offer legal protection, and it's the spirit of those laws that what should be carried forward to now, not the letter.\n\nAsking for a woman's parents' blessing is not just some transaction that needs to be ticked off. Possibly out dated as men aren't always the primary breadwinners anymore, but the point of asking for her parents' blessing is in doing exactly what is being said, it's acknowledgement that she is their child that they have loved and raised, and asking if they support and agree that you will be a good husband for her. It should be a place of humility, not pride.\n\nSo, back to your daughter's boyfriend. There were several red flags in what he did, but the feeling I'm getting from your description is he hasn't grown past the point of seeing women as NPC's. He went through the \"right\" movements and then when he was denied your \"blessing\" he left, meaning he has no idea what he's doing and should not be getting married. You sound like a good mother and y6did the right thing.", "NTA \n\nThough to shed light on why a person that young would be talking like that, I can tell you because I was raised in that environment. \n\nHis whole life he\u2019s been told that marriage is everything. He\u2019s been told not to have sex until he\u2019s married and he\u2019s also been told that if you\u2019ve dated someone for a few months, you can get married: and should unless you fall into sin. He\u2019s been obsessed with the idea for so long because he\u2019s horny and really does believe that the daughter is his gift from God for being so pure. Trust me, dating I\u2019m those circles is muuuuch different than what most of us consider normal. It\u2019s about getting married and having kids. It\u2019s pretty weird. To be honest, he\u2019s been brainwashed into believing all this and with time, he might find his way. But your daigh should run for the hills. \n\nJust thought I\u2019d shed some light on that bit for you. And NTA-though your daughter is an adult is going to date and marry who she does so maybe make sure she knows that you love her and support her no matter what. After all, if she has lost her mind and marries a guy like that, she\u2019ll need you more than ever.", "that was my first guess too.

Then you get into Mennonites that live like Amish people and aside from the men\u2019s facial hair, they look a lot like Amish people. Then you have holdeman Mennonites and, again, the men wear whatever they want but the women wear small black bonnets. Aside from the 1st group of Mennonites I mentioned, all Mennonite women should wear dresses or skirts. \n\nAccording to my husband any outsider who joins a Mennonite church will be welcome but the people will always think of them like an outsider. \n\nI\u2019m attending 1 of my sister-in-law\u2019s wedding this weekend.
