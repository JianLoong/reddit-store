My daughter is 21, and I've been a single mother most of her life, with occasional visits from my ex-husband. I have always wanted my daughter to be independent and to do what is best for her. I was not raised with religion and am agnostic/atheist leaning.\n\nMy daughter is in college, which I am happy to pay for. She got a boyfriend 7 months ago, whom I haven't met yet, but she spoke well of him.\n\nSo she showed up at my door with her boyfriend, who was wearing a suit, and introduced himself.\n\nI invited them in, served coffee and tried to get him to talk so I could get to know him better. He immediately started talking about how much he loved my daughter and how much he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and asked for my blessing. I thought this was strange, this boy just walked into my house and asked me to marry my daughter? I hardly knew his last name and I do not care about blessings, but they are too young.\n\nHe started saying that he would provide for her, that his family was a good, God-loving family, that they were well-off, that she wouldn't have to study or work, and that I would benefit from joining them. He said that traditions were important to him, that their future children would have a nice private education, that we could join their religious community, and that the wedding would be in a nice church in the middle of nowhere.\n\nFirst, I'm surprised that such a young boy could be so deeply religious, sounds like my grandfather's crazy friends, second, my daughter wouldn't study or work? No, I didn't raise my child to be a barefoot, cleaning, cooking, pregnant trophy wife. As much as I do not care about parental blessing, I have actively refused it and explained my reasons very well. I am paying for her education and letting it go to waste, and I want my daughter to be her own person and not a doormat.\n\nThe BF was silent, stood up, thanked me and left with my daughter.\n\nLater the next day she called me crying and screaming. She said she had tried to get her father's blessing and he had also refused. She accused me of conspiring against her happiness, and her boyfriend said he wouldn't marry into a family that doesn't know God, and that I was ruining her life.\n\nI dont know why she wants this kind of life, but her boyfriend looks and sounds sketchy AF, but I wonder if I should have left her alone. Am I the asshole? Did I ruin this for everyone?", "created_utc": 1678384874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11myynt/aita_for_not_giving_my_blessing_to_my_daughters_bf/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I am agnostic/atheist and felt uncomfortable when the boyfriend talked about my daughter not studying or working and being a trophy wife. As a result, I refused to give my blessing and explained my reasoning to them. Unfortunately, my daughter and boyfriend stormed out of the house and my daughter accused me of ruining her life.

Man, I get that a lot as an atheist.", "NTA - Considering she lived with you all her life, your daughter HAD to know about your lack of relgious leanings.  I strongly suspect she was lying to this person and was hoping it would slide past.  She's likely already fallen into whatever rabbit hole he was recruiting her for, but I have to say I'm surprised that he backed away.  Most of these cult-level groups would have used the parental refusals as a weapon to drag their victim deeper into the trap.  \"See, we're the only ones who care about you, you don't need them, blah, blah, blah.\"  Frankly I wouldn't be surprised if his pull back is just him making sure she's really unhappy with you before he comes back with \"Oh, I've prayed and God tells me I should save you and you should leave your unbelieving parents behind and never talk to them again, so I'm going to be gracious and marry you anyway.\"  Just keep a sharp eye out, but since she's of legal age, I doubt you can do much.", "Was the boy's last name Duggar, by any chance?", "NTA. Even without all the weird religious stuff, I can\u2019t imagine giving my blessing to someone I had literally just met, or to someone my child hasn\u2019t even known for a year. Without an established relationship, your blessing would be totally meaningless.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d tell them if he wants your blessing, you need time to get to know him, and spend time with them as a couple. They are adults and don\u2019t need your permission, but if it\u2019s important to them, then they can wait a bit longer.", "NTA \n\nI am somewhat religious and wouldn't give my blessing to someone like that. All kind of bad vibes. I think that your daughter is better off even if she doesn't realize it yet.\n\nWhen she is talking to you again, ask why she didn't want to finish college, if she would have had access to her own money, and if they would have made joint decisions or the now ex-BF would have had final say.", "NTA - It sounds like a scary situation. But perhaps don't use the excuse of 'too young' as I'm sure she can do the math too.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou kid is in a cult.", "So I'm going to say this as a Christian man who got married only a few years ago and went to my wife's parents to ask for their blessing: you were right to say no, NTA\n\nA touch of context before I go further. I'm not from America, my country has Judeo-Christian values underlying society, but the population is about 50/50 secular to religious. We also don't really have that social pressure to be \"religious\", so people who say they are actually are and aren't just paying lip service, which is great as it means people actually take their own faith seriously.\n\nAs far as \"religious\" people treating women as less than men, they tend to base this in some old testament laws regarding treating women, such as if you wanted a wife you bought her from her father. Now, this does sound incredibly backwards, and treats women as second class citizens, people conveniently \"forget\" the context. This was written at a time when women were treated as third class citizens, when if you wanted a wife you just abducted her. These laws were meant to improve things and offer legal protection, and it's the spirit of those laws that what should be carried forward to now, not the letter.\n\nAsking for a woman's parents' blessing is not just some transaction that needs to be ticked off. Possibly out dated as men aren't always the primary breadwinners anymore, but the point of asking for her parents' blessing is in doing exactly what is being said, it's acknowledgement that she is their child that they have loved and raised, and asking if they support and agree that you will be a good husband for her. It should be a place of humility, not pride.\n\nSo, back to your daughter's boyfriend. There were several red flags in what he did, but the feeling I'm getting from your description is he hasn't grown past the point of seeing women as NPC's. He went through the \"right\" movements and then when he was denied your \"blessing\" he left, meaning he has no idea what he's doing and should not be getting married. You sound like a good mother and y6did the right thing.", "NTA \n\nThough to shed light on why a person that young would be talking like that, I can tell you because I was raised in that environment. \n\nHis whole life he\u2019s been told that marriage is everything. He\u2019s been told not to have sex until he\u2019s married and he\u2019s also been told that if you\u2019ve dated someone for a few months, you can get married: and should unless you fall into sin. He\u2019s been obsessed with the idea for so long because he\u2019s horny and really does believe that the daughter is his gift from God for being so pure. Trust me, dating I\u2019m those circles is muuuuch different than what most of us consider normal. It\u2019s about getting married and having kids. It\u2019s pretty weird. To be honest, he\u2019s been brainwashed into believing all this and with time, he might find his way. But your daigh should run for the hills. \n\nJust thought I\u2019d shed some light on that bit for you. And NTA-though your daughter is an adult is going to date and marry who she does so maybe make sure she knows that you love her and support her no matter what. After all, if she has lost her mind and marries a guy like that, she\u2019ll need you more than ever.", "that was my first guess too.

That alone is worth a moment of pause, if nothing else.", "She prob didn't mention it in fear of him leaving her", "Agreed - OP had good reason to withhold the blessing by virtue of never having met the young man before. Saying she's not comfortable giving such a blessing before getting to know him and while daughter is young and in school might have avoided escalating the situation while retaining the option to flat out deny a blessing if she chooses later on. This way, the girl feels persecuted and has something to rebel against...", "Uhh definitely! Sounds like he forgot to mention that she\u2019d be wife #1 (assuming she\u2019s even the first!). The entire approach was uncomfortably transactional, like, \u201csign your daughter over to be my property, now, kthx\u201d", "What do you have against stay at home mothers?", "This is the one I agree with the most.", ">But did you say what you said here?

I also asked what if they divorce? and he said that his family doesn't believe in divorce. I said that I do since I'm divorced and is one of the best decisions I made in my life. \n\nAlso said she is too young and is better to wait to take these huge life defining choices.

Also 7 months dating is such a short time, and you don't really know your partner in just 7 months.", "this is a weird way to frame the situation, her daughter is 21 and is asking for permission to essentially end her academic/professional life to commit her life to a guy she's been dating for 7 months\n\nsaying \"if that's what you want then ok\" would be terrible parenting, OP is doing the right thing to try to make it clear how potentially disastrous this situation could be\n\nthe way her boyfriend is weaponizing this against her should make it clear that he is not on the up and up", "Being a parent means that you must protect your child's best interest. Even if it comes at the price of consistent internal logic. It's like telling a doormat of a person that they should stand up for themselves more and not listen to what everyone says! and yet, you are telling them what to do. It doesnt void your argument.\n\nIt is statistically a Bad Idea for her daughter to abandon college for a deeply religious man she has just met, and that wants to isolate her in a religious community. If he loved her so much, he would be able to reach a compromise where she finished her studies before marrying, if parental approval is so important to him. He would be able to understand why her mother feels uncomfortable, and not reject her based on that.", "I spend a lot of my time on Reddit on the Bates sub and yepx this pings my fundie radar.", "Yeah exactly! Like of course they are going to say no, he is a total stranger!", "To be completely fair, my honest and unfiltered reaction would be to have a minor heart attack and see if she can get a semester abroad.", "There\u2019s a difference between someone who chooses to stay at home and someone whose husband gives her no choice but to stay home. They didn\u2019t say anything about mothers who choose to stay home with their kids. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. She also did volunteer stuff, creative projects, etc. Now that my brother and I are grown she is very active in the community. She doesn\u2019t need a paying job but if she had at some point, the fact that she stayed engaged with the world outside the house would help. This is very different from a wife in a cult who is not allowed to do anything outside the home and who would be unable to leave her husband.", "While I agree with this sounding like a disaster, telling your daughter she's going to be a pregnant trophy wife is not going to win you any points with her and is just going to push her away. \n\n\nObviously this guy is warping her sense of self....these are questions you need to ask her without him present. Because now they are going back and he's saying \"Your parents don't care about your future. I love you. God loves you.\"", "Are you going to do a arranged marriage for your daughter?", "I mean, I don't disagree with you, but she's still an adult that's allowed to make that decision for herself.\n\nYou, I, and OP can disagree with that decision, but it's still hypocritical of OP to say you're your own person who can make your own decisions about yourself, except if you decide X.", "Yes, I agree with this.", "I haven't been there in ages, but I'd pay to see either Kelly/Gil or Michelle/Jim Bob keeping sweet as one of their lost boys marries the daughter of someone who believes in education and the autonomy of women!", "Where does it say ops daughter was forced to do this? Considering how upset she is I would assume the absolute opposite of it.  So are you talking a out a different person or something", "no", "I can tell my 21 year old child that they're their own person and I respect their choices and still heavily discourage them from dropping out of college to eg marry a fundy cultist, join the circus, pick up a heroin habit, join a metal band etc. I don't think that's hypocritical I think it's common sense and like the most basic level of parenting. It'd be malpractice do anything else.", "Found the cult member.", "While I agree with what you're saying, I do believe that is hypocritical.\n\nI think it's definitely better to be hypocritical than let someone make a bad decision without saying anything first, but it's still hypocritical."]}
