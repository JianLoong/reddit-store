{"id": 2517, "submission_id": "yx2w5z", "title": "AITA: yelling at mother in law for not helping out around the house?", "selftext": "My husband (39M) ended up the hospital this weekend with pneumonia, so his mother dropped everything and drove halfway across the country (16 hours) to visit without warning. My husband's health has been delicate recently, and we're in the stages of seeing different specialists and trying to get answers.\n\nSince my MIL has been here, it's been tough on all of us. Our guest room has a large daybed, so my husband has been sleeping in there since it's easier for him to sleep sitting up to prevent coughing. But now my MIL has the guest room, so my husband hasn't been getting much sleep. She also hasn't been doing anything useful. While I'm at work, my husband says she just watches tv all day.  He's been doing chores like walking the dog and making himself lunch.\n\nWorse, next week, we could really use some help getting him to a doctor an hour from here. I've already taken so much time off of work that it would be a huge help if she could take him. However, she says she has to leave before then for a dentist appointment.\n\n**Last night, I yelled at her for not helping around the house and showing up without planning.** I feel that she's being really selfish coming here without warning, inconveniencing us, and not even helping around the house. I don't expect her to clean, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to take care of him while I'm at work. He doesn't even need much; bringing him a drink or sandwich would be super helpful.\n\nShe's been sulking ever since I yelled at her. My husband doesn't have the energy to handle this. Am I an asshole? Is there another light I can see this in? I'm just stressed out that now we have to take care a guest when we're already in crisis mode.", "created_utc": 1668625715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx2w5z/aita_yelling_at_mother_in_law_for_not_helping_out/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She showed up uninvited with what I assume was the intention to be there for her son while he\u2019s sick. You\u2019re right, she shouldn\u2019t have to clean the house, but to not even offer to walk the dog with him in case something happened\u2026.why is she there? I think you\u2019re seeing it clearly and it has been an added stress in and already stressful time.", "NTA. Family comes and visits during times of sickness and weakness so they can help. Sitting around watching TV isn't helping, it's making it worse. She can pull her weight or go off to wherever she came out of.", "NTA. Why did she even show up? To take up needed space and inconvenience everyone? Please talk to her again and give her actionable tasks. Or kindly ask her to go home. The day bed would be more helpful than her.", "NTA. I would have paid for a hotel for two nights and then told her visiting time was over. No way I would have made the sick patient give up his bed for anyone.", "Nope NTA \u2014 if she\u2019s going to be there then help. Otherwise, gtfo so then no one will expect you to help & you aren\u2019t creating more chaos", "NTA, I don't understand why she came if she didn't want to help out.", "NTA. This is incredibly clear-cut. Why did she even come? To be there in case he dies? The whole point of dropping everything to come when someone's very sick is that you come to help that person or you help their primary caretaker so that they can devote all their time. You're supposed to lighten the load. I know if I was sick, my mom would be indespensible.", "NTA.  You asked another light, maybe she needs to be told what to do. Give her a list of chores and ask if there is anything that she can do.  If she says she can't do anything then there is zero reason for her to be in the house.", "NTA I can't believe she isn't pitching in to help.", "NTA\u2014 I had a relative who did this after I had a baby. Yeah, ideally, I guess \u201cthanks for coming to help with Bob! Here\u2019s an itemized list of things you could do that would be a huge help for him! I really appreciate you coming here when he\u2019s sick\u2014 I know it\u2019s not the fun vacation you hoped to have in the summer!\u201d \n\nBut barring that, her acting ideally would be \u201cI\u2019m here to help Bob! What can I do?\u201d It seems impossible that she doesn\u2019t see that there\u2019s anything she can do for her son with pneumonia! \n\nSo yeah, I think \u201cI\u2019m sorry, as you can see my husband is very sick and it\u2019s not a good time for entertaining,\u201d was in order. \n\nIt\u2019s nuts to think that going to people\u2019s home in a time of crisis and not offering to help is ok. \n\nBest wishes to your husband!", "NTA\n\nShe is using her son to shine as the good samaritan and meanwhile having some vacation....", "KICK HER OUT - she is not contribution, she is adding to the work and stress of the situation and is getting a holiday from actual household chores and responsibilities. NTA - move her on", "No. If she\u2019s not helping, there\u2019s no reason for her to be there. She\u2019s just another person to take care of. \n\nTell her you\u2019re stressed out with everything and apologize for yelling, but tell her it\u2019s time to go home. NTA", "NTA. Why did she come if it wasn't to help? When someone is sick it is not a time for visits, it's time to stay away or come to hands on helping.\n\nMy latina mother would cook, clean l, walk the dogs, do laundry, and you better not refuse the snacks or else. Drove to doctors? She's in. Going to the pharmacy? Bet your ass she's going. Doing groceries? She goes, you just pay. I'm sick and don't want to eat? Of course I want, I just didn't let her tell me! You get the idea.", "She came without an invitation. \n\nShe took the bed the sick person needs, away from him. \n\nShe's taking a vacation, while the sick person does the chores.\n\n**Kick her out now.  Yesterday.  She's made the situation worse,** not better.  She's not helping.  Find someone else to drive him to the appointment, or hire someone.  Having the house to himself is better than having to her there.\n\nNTA.  She is.  She's taking advantage to take a vacation, while you are in crisis, and she's doing nothing to help.  She's making it all worse, not better.  She needs to go, now.\n\nIf you have to, pack up her suitcase, put it in her car, and send her off.  If she won't go, call the police to escort her out.  She's terrible.  She's shown no concern or care at all, in her actions, for either of you.  She needs to go.  Doesn't matter what words she says, her actions belie them.", "NTA.  Uninvited in-laws that add to the burden are the worst.  Might as well ask her to leave.", "NTA. Honestly, I wouldn't have let her stay in the first place", "NTA, this is a stressful time, and she's just making it worse. If I were you, I'd send her tf home.", "NTA.   \nIf she\u2019s there out of concern for her son, where is the concern?", "NTA She is the AH. You have reached your limit. You regret yelling, so apogee for the vume but repeat in a quiet voice that you and your husband need HELP. The TV can watch itself. If she isn't going to help she needs to leave.", "NTA, but maybe could\u2019ve told her in a more calm way. Or you could tell her you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her but that she could be more helpful since she\u2019s staying with you.", "On one hand, she is a guest, but she showed up unannounced. She intruded into your home without invitation because who gives a shit about invitations? She brought him into this world, so she can intrude on him whenever she wants (if it\u2019s not obvious, this is sarcasm btw). \n\nYou have boundaries. She has broken very rudely them. She is there to support her son, but isn\u2019t exactly supportive of him. Hell, she won\u2019t even take the time to help him. She won\u2019t even take the time to get him to his doctor.\n\nWhy is she even still at your house? She\u2019s not even remotely helping out at all. She\u2019s just there wasting your time and not even contributing to helping with his declining health, and if she\u2019s not expecting to assist her son while she\u2019s there, she has absolutely no reason to be there other than wasting space in your home.\n\nI would tell MIL to pack her bags and go back home since she obviously doesn\u2019t feel any obligation to really be there for her son.\n\nNTA.", "Very much NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like obviously her coming unannounced and also not helping is super shitty. But also I'm guessing with your husband's health she has been just as concerned as you and probably not thinking all that logically. \n\nNTA, you're under a lot of stress so it's understandable, but perhaps just make amends and tell her that while she is staying tkj would appreciate a little more help in general.", "NTA and husband needs to tell her it's time for her to go back home.

I\u2019m confused \n\nNTA for sure!", "Why don\u2019t you give her fixed tasks, maybe verbalize your needs ?", "ETA it's self explanatory why she's ta but you are too. You should've communicated waaaaay before it got to the point of yelling while your husband is sick. He's going through a lot of health issues and still doing chores etc. He doesn't need the extra stress of you two yelling at each other. If you had healthy communication and she didn't respond well, then you can take next steps. But you get to control your character and responses. \n\nI also have a lot of empathy for the fact that you're also going through a lot with no help. It's probably difficult to control your emotions when you have all this weight on your shoulders. I encourage you to talk to a friend or trusted person. Maybe take some time to go somewhere and yell or cry.", "Nta,  mil is putting undo stress on all of you. And no consideration  to anyone but herself", "NTA.  Why did she come if she isn\u2019t going to help?  She could watch TV at home.", "NTA  I would ask her to leave.  Immediately.  As in, tomorrow morning.  Let her go see a dentist where she lives.  She is making your lives harder during an already difficult time.  Get her off the daybed and give it back to your husband, who needs his sleep.", "ESH. Her for showing up unannounced and causing issues. You for yelling. Seriously what is it with so many in AITA that you yell so freaking much? I don't get that. Talking to her...sure. Having a hissy screaming fit? Man so many people have issues. Yes she should be helping out. Did yall have a talk when she arrived asking her to handle certain things?"]}
