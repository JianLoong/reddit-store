I\u2019m lucky to have a non-fussy baby. He only really cries if he\u2019s super hungry. However, he has earned the nickname \u201cMr. Poop\u201d as he has the occasional poopsplosion. One of these happened last night. My husband was taking a nap last night as this all went down. I went to our kitchen to wash a couple bottles and I heard the baby fussing a bit in his bouncer. I come check on him to find half the bouncer pooped on along with the onesie he\u2019s wearing. I quickly removed his bouncer cloth and his clothes and took his diaper off and immediately gave him a bath. I put the soiled clothes into a plastic bag and left it to the side. Thankfully his bowel movements aren\u2019t too bad because he\u2019s a newborn still so they don\u2019t really smell, nonetheless it\u2019s still shit. After bathing him and feeding him I was exhausted (I don\u2019t get to nap during the day usually because my husband doesn\u2019t usually take over with taking care of the little guy-either during the day or night) so we went to bed. This morning I realized that I have to soak his clothes because I forgot to last night. So I put some hot water and detergent in the kitchen sink and let everything soak before I rinsed it. We went on a walk this morning and as we came back my husband got up and as soon as he saw the soaking clothes with the poop he lost his shit. He called me \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d and insane and started yelling at me pretty bad, asking me wtf is wrong with me etc. I honest to God was planning on bleaching the entire sink completely after the soak and I did end up doing so, but he said that it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m completely crazy and it was really dumb what I did. He said I should\u2019ve used a bucket outside instead but I honestly just did what I had to do as quickly as possible without having to leave the baby by himself inside. Now I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I should\u2019ve been more mindful and maybe it was stupid of me to use the kitchen sink\u2026 so, AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your input. I appreciate all the responses and comments, especially the other mothers who can sympathize with my impulsive decision. To answer a couple questions:\n\n1. Why not use a bathtub or utility sink? We only have a shower and we live in the back house of a big property where there is no washer or dryer, or utility sink. \n\n2. Does my husband often speak to me this way? It happens every once in a while. He\u2019s never put his hands on me but he has a mean temper and can name call. He was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder last year when he went to the psychiatric hospital, and put on Abilify. The medication helped a lot but made him much more sleepy/tired. He still loses his temper at times. We used to go to counseling and have weekly marriage meetings which we stopped due to complacency. We\u2019ve been married for 1.5 years, together almost 6 years. This is our only child.\n\n3. Did you end up cleaning the sick afterwards? Yes I bleached it twice and scrubbed the literally shit out of it and threw out the sponge I used.", "created_utc": 1689524721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151ahgn/aita_for_soaking_my_babys_poop_clothes_in_the/", "score": 1745, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you're cleaning it, it's fine.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't advise that your husband is acting like an asshole in his own right. Not helping with the baby is bad enough; calling you \"braindead\" and other such insults is unacceptable. He needs to have an ounce of respect and compassion for his partner.

Mistakes will be made, but you're learning from them, so job well done. Suggestion, you might be feeding your newborn too much, or check the fit of your diapers as they could be a size too big. Newborns poop a lot, but not necessarily all at once. Maybe try feeding more frequently, but smaller quantities at a time. Also, your partner doesn't sound like a very nice person. He should be more understanding and forgiving. His over the top reaction was unbelievably mean.

You are tired, you are only 2 months postpartum. You planned to clean the kitchen sink after, and that's fine. It's not like you soaked it with the lettuce. However, your husband's behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and inexcusable. I'm sure he's also tired, but that's no excuse. He needs to find somewhere else to go for a few days to consider his life, before he comes back and apologizes. Then he needs therapy. You just gave him a baby. Seriously.", "NTA, while having poopy diapers in the kitchen sink probably seems icky to many people because the kitchen is used to prepare food, his reaction was over the top ridiculous. He could have calmly told you that he thought it was gross and please use a bucket next time. But as long as the sink was cleaned afterwards, there's no actual risk to anyone. I mean, unless you are vegetarians, you have probably used the kitchen sink numerous times to clean up after preparing raw chicken, which is full of nasty bacteria and probably far more dangerous that baby poop. However, it's fine because dish soap is extremely effective at killing bacteria.", "Yikes where to start.\n\nFirst NTA, you did nothing wrong. Your first priority is that your baby is safe, fed, clean and rested. Everything else takes a backseat to this.\n\nSecondly, your husband has no right to treat you that way. Especially since he is being a complete deadbeat when it comes to child care. This isn't the 50's. Talk to him, try to get him to go to therapy, him yelling and insulting you is only adding undue stress to a crummy situation.\n\nThirdly, baby poop for the first few months is mostly water soluble if the baby is breast fed.

We decided to split roles to help with all the baby stuff and I do 90% of the cooking and kitchen cleaning. I normally wake up with our son around 4:30am and stay with him to let mommy sleep as much as possible before I have to leave for work. When I come home my first instinct is to ask her how can I help her and take care of everything I can to give her a break.

You need to tell a woman in his life about this or he\u2019ll keep it up.", "NTA. You\u2019re a new mom and learning as you go. You have a newborn child and are a bit frazzled right now.

There is nothing wrong with washing soiled diapers in the sink. You just clean it after with bleach. People suggested the tub, which is more difficult (lots of bending over), wastes more water, and is larger to clean afterwards. Sinks are smaller and make more sense for one diaper.", "NTA any parent who has been there can fully understand. Your husband is abusive and should never have said that.

No. But not being the best location doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA - It was a gross thing to do, but that doesn't make you an AH. Calling you what he did makes him a hardcore AH though.

I think it's gross that you did that, let's be real, poop and food don't mix. Put it in the bathroom sink /bathtub, outside, etc.. in plain terms of right or wrong, I think on this issue, you were wrong. \n\nNow let's get to the flaming elephant in the room, and that's your husband. Regardless of the situation, there is no reason to treat your partner like he did. The stress of having a baby isn't small, and he isn't helping at all. He is absolutly the asshole for how he reacted, and you need to have a sit down with him immediately to address your concerns without anyone raising their voice. If it devolved into him yelling, walk away.\nNow you have 2 choices either schedule a couples therapy or file for divorce. Because the current situation is not ok and you can choose to stay, but your child can't. And since you already have a child, you have no choice but to do one of those two things to protect your child.", "Personally I would avoid using the kitchen sink but you did what you had to do in the moment. I\u2019m assuming this is your first and you\u2019re still figuring it all out. Of course you were going to fully sanitize the sink afterwards because you\u2019re actually a sensible adult human but going forward it might make your life easier to get a cheap plastic bin from the dollar store for soaking poopy clothes.\n\nYou\u2019re husband is throwing up some major red flags with his response though. This is a vulnerable time for you and often when abusive partners begin or escalate their behaviour. Please take care of yourself and your little one.

Calling you brain dead was over the top. He could have asked to do it himself, or asked if you needed a hand, but like a lot of men these days, they shrug off their wives feelings and have diarrhea of the mouth and letting anything and everything they think fly out of it.

If that is the way he responds to anger or something going awry, (bc things go awry and messy when you have kids all the time and kids put gross things in places they shouldn't because they don't know better), is he going to react the same? This could traumatize the kid and also be an example that can encourage anger in the future......\n\nHow long have you been married? Does he react like this often? I am not sure, but if there is a pattern here it can be abuse and something you may not want to get you, or your child further involved in. If this was a one time thing, it is still not acceptable to react that way and if he is struggling with anger, he should be going to therapy and not taking it out on you. Please have a talk with him if you feel comfortable and if this anger is consistent and becoming a pattern, counseling and/or more drastic measures may be more appropriate.

Is this what you want them to perceive as normal? Do you want them to grow up and treat people this way, because they think it's normal? Or for them to go entirely in the other direction, and end up in an even more abusive situation because they assume it's normal?\n\nYou made a mistake. It's not the end of the world. We all make them. What's more concerning is raising a child with a person who clearly doesn't value or respect you (or their child).", "A real good mentor for the child OPs husband is while she is single-handedly raising him. Jesus he sounds awful. She's trying to hold it together- while trying to not only heal her own body but take care of her newborn what sounds like single-handedly while her asshole husband is name calling and getting his beauty sleep. Next time wash the baby's diaper in his cereal bowl, and kick his ass to the curb. You know why? Because in a few years your kid will start to learn from his awful behavior and that's how he's going to treat a woman in his future. I honestly could care less about women who put up with men who treat them terribly because to each their own and if they want to stay it's not my place to say. *HOWEVER*, once that woman has a child, she has a responsibility to make sure he's raised to become a good person and that means not learning to treat women like that. Get out of there or he will raise your son to believe that's okay and do that to another woman.", "She obviously doesn't deserve to be emotionally abused over it but let's not suddenly act like it isn't disgusting.

As in, you\u2019ll put it in the sink, but it has to sit in a bowl?", "Not the asshole. Currently I\u2019m a stay at home father for a 5 month old, by choice. Quite literally, shit happens. I know how it goes in terms of poopy babies, and there have been many a times where I soak my sons cloths in the sink. I have a sprayer on my sink so I just turn the hot water on and spray it all down the drain and then fill with soap and water and let sit. My wife doesn\u2019t even bat a eye.", "NTA.\n\nSo way back in the day, it's wasn't all that uncommon to wash your whole ass baby in the kitchen sink. Kid finished lunch, is messy, and maybe had a small poopsplosion? Off come the clothes and pop the kid into a clean, empty of dishes, sink. I have pictures somewhere of my grandma bathing me (33) in her kitchen sink. The same sink we still use today. All to often, it was the most convenient. And sometimes it was the only sink you had.", "I do not think YTA. I personally would\u2019ve taken it to the bathroom sink, but we work with what we have, and as a mother myself, for the first year of my child\u2019s life the brain fog was real. I\u2019m still forgetful \ud83d\ude02 but on a serious note; The way your husband spoke to you is absolutely abusive, and abysmal. You need to have a talk with him about that, or leave his ass. You are having some serious bodily and mental changes, and those \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d words are the last thing you need right now, and he doesn\u2019t help with his kid?! If anyone here is the asshole, it\u2019s your husband. My husband (late he passed away) was extremely awful and abusive and would speak to me like this all the time in my sensitive postpartum period. Literally. He told me I smelt like shit and that I needed to shower. He would scream at me and throw things, he would constantly berate me and put me down, in front of our kid. Abuse isn\u2019t just physical. Words last longer in your mind than any bruise ever could last physically. It\u2019s been almost 2 years since he died and I still struggle with it. You are not alone, seek therapy and get away from this man. If I can do it as a single parent, you can too. It\u2019s hard, really hard. But you have to protect your baby.", "He's an AH. With A big red flag for a head.\n\n  I mean sure, I can see why some people might freak out. But, as long as you bleached it after, really it's not so bad as it's a teeny tiny new born and you are not being supported at all.\n\nConsider going to stay with family for awhile if you can.", "NTA. a little unhygienic? maybe. would i do it? no. doesn't make you an asshole though. \n\nyour husband is. you say you're tending to baby day and night - hes 8 weeks old. did you get any recovery time after birth at all? hes a newborn. that is incredibly stressful and I don't think anybody with half a braincell would be criticising you for a tiny lapse in judgement. why isn't your husband also looking after his child so you can rest? \n\nhis language is abusive. I don't care if he's never laid a hand on you, he's still abusive. speak to someone else about what happened so if he does escalate his behaviour, you have an exit plan and support. a lot of abusers wait until they have their victim \"locked in\" either by marriage or a baby before really going in on them. I am concerned for you, OP.", "ESH. He should not have called you that. Personally the harshest thing I call my girlfriend or my kids is a goofball and they get the message.\n\nHowever, the kitchen sink is not where shit goes. Buy a bucket.", "Your husband sucks. You are TA for being married to such a loser.", "ESH: you for soaking the baby's poop clothes in the kitchen sink. And your husband for his behaviour.", "YTA, you are fucking brain dead and if I were your husband I\u2019d abuse you too.", "Uh, I don't need to read the novel to know YTA. \n\n\"We\" as in any food safety or public health person advises against rinsing or washing raw chicken in a kitchen sink because the sink and kitchen area doesn't get thoroughly cleaned well enough to prevent food poisoning. This was demostrated with studies to back up the advise. Human feces at any stage of the lifecycle is exponentially worse. \n\nBleach every part of your kitchen sink, handles, counters, and all handles in your kitchen for at least 10 minutes to sanitize - after manually cleaning them all.", "There are pictures of me and my sister being washed in a bowl in the kitchen sink. That was 40 odd years ago, but surely standards haven't changed that much?", "People who rinse chicken are nasty too.", "He's abusive and lazy. She's doing 100% of the baby work and he has the nerve to call her brain dead when he's the only one sleeping. His mood disorder is no excuse. He's not being a good father or husband. You should reevaluate whether this is the type of person you want around your children. You just had your first and he's already being abusive and making you do all of the work. Sleeping Beauty needs a lesson that you will not tolerate this behavior AT ALL and if he doesn't go back to counseling alone and get his \"disorder\" under control, he might not be your husband. He doesn't get to treat you this way. NTA", "Right??? \u201cReal abuse\u201d me arse, he\u2019s already shown her what that is, and that\u2019s calling her \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d. And the fact that she says this is an occurrence \u201cevery once in a while\u201d _that is once in a while too often._ I get newborn fatigue, it\u2019s tough looking after kids, especially young recently-borns or newborns, but that doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to shout at the woman who birthed your child for having that same fatigue, _and then fucking threaten her._", "I mean, I do agree technically. However, OP has stated that they do not have a bathtub nor a sink apart from the kitchen one. She literally had no other option than to use the kitchen sink, plus she said she had cleaned it twice and threw away the sponge. Even if you miss a spot the first time around, it\u2019s likely she\u2019d have gotten the second time, and frankly any hot water used on the area is likely to kill off harmful bacteria.\n\nWould recommend getting a bucket, filling it about halfway with hot water, adding a little bit of the detergent and leaving the clothes to soak in future though.", "Some of the stuff I\u2019ve had in my kitchen sink would make peoples skin crawl going off the comments. Bleach is a thing.", "OP based on other comments where after he verbally abused you, he threatened physical abuse, I'm honestly worried about you. He doesn't even have the excuse of being a bit snippy because he's exhausted, which even then wouldn't account for this and isn't in the same ballpark. If you need to hear it again, there is no reason to EVER talk to your partner the way your husband talked to you. Period. Do you have family or friends that you would consider healthy/not abusive/not in abusive relationships? Like for example if your Mom or a friend heard him speak to you like that, would they be okay with it? Sometimes we're used to seeing that behavior around us so we think it's okay, but it's not, but also sometimes thinking about it like that can help you see it better. Please ruminate on this. You deserve better and your child who will start to form memories in a couple of years deserves better too. \n\nEdit : typo", "There is absolutely no way you wilfully or unintentionally misunderstood their comment to such a degree.", "Who said he wasn't a good dad?\n\nEveryone rushing to judge.", "C\u2019mon, you can\u2019t be serious with that last paragraph. Newborns have every germ their mother does in their body when they\u2019re born and pick up more every day they exist. No poop is \u201cclean\u201d, whether newborn, adult, dog, or cat-it\u2019s waste, it\u2019s the dirtiest excretion a human can have. And it doesn\u2019t belong in the sink. My God, use a bucket or large container (that you\u2019re willing to keep for shitty clothes as it\u2019s going to happen again) to soak the shitty clothes and linen, pour that down the toilet, clean it well and save for the next time.", "The threat of worse abuse is truly one of the most chilling types of abuse. OP deserves so much better. This is not ok and just hurts my heart.", "OP your spouse is scarily abusive. This is not OK. This is not OK. This is not OK. You need to make a safe plan for an exit. It will only get harder to leave.", "I'm so sorry.  Yeah, it very much appears as if he's gearing up to take the abuse to the physical realm.", "Someone spewing out such threats doesn't deserve a family. OP should really consider finding a way out. Even if the family is thousands of miles away. \n\nMy mom left my dad when I was a baby - she even flew overseas to return to her home country, to her family to start all over. No contact to this day after decades... to him of course - she took me home as well", "If you were to get poop on your hand, would you wash it off in a bucket outside? Or\u2026in a sink?", "It\u2019s textbook coercive control, which is getting outlawed in some countries, thank god.", "You missed the sarcasm there", "Bleach isn't as effective of a cleaner compared to something like pine sol and you'd have to soak it for a certain amount of time before wiping it. But bleach is better than soap and water, just have to soak", "You asked I answered. Your comment wasn\u2019t about how people sanitized but if sanitizing it is enough now you\u2019re backtracking.", "Well I try not to put food in the sink, if I have to it's usually suspended. But the bowl would be on the counter usually since I prefer it to be within reach for cooking", "I think we\u2019re on the same page then. Sinks are inherently dirty to me, I never let any food come in direct contact. I hate even putting a colander in there to drain pasta or rinse produce.", "NTA, both of you are dealing with a newborn, he\u2019s not helping . Give him a book about how to be a dad . He needs one", ">he lost his shit\n\n>He called me \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d\n\n>started yelling at me pretty bad, \n\n>he said that it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m completely crazy and it was really dumb what I did\n\n>he has a mean temper and can name call.\n\nIf you want to subject yourself to this psycho, fine.\n\nBut you will be a terrible mother if you allow this man to treat your child in the disgusting manner he treats you.", "YTA. Disgusting.", "you are the asshole \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\ude39", "Absolutely agree. I wonder if he\u2019s ever scrubbed the shit out of the clothes himself - I\u2019ll take a wild guess that he hasn\u2019t. His overreaction is concerning. \n\nWe only had one sink when our poop factories were babies - we did buy a plastic washing up bowl for poop purposes in the end, as it was easier to have things soak and still use the sink.", "I'm sorry, rinse chicken in a sink? Who's out there in the world rinsing their chicken (hehe)", "You\u2019ve just voted her as an asshole btw", "he intended to belittle and cause emotional harm. it is abusive, plain and simple.", "you really shouldn't say it whether or not you mean it. that is abusive language, and if you think it's okay, i how you're single and stay that way until you learn how to better communicate.", "If you\u2019re going to throw away everything that gets poop on it, then a baby\u2019s entire wardrobe would be disposable. Their bed sheets. Car seat. High chair. All their blankets. Seriously, it may be gross, but it can still be cleaned.", "You do know that your phone has more poop on it than a sink that's been bleached twice after contact with poop right?", "Yeah so people shower and bathe in tubs and that\u2019s a larger, harder area to clean- cleaning a kitchen sink is easy. What is it you all use your sinks for? I rinse food in a collindar or strainer, dishes soak in there before going into a dishwasher - dishwashers sanitize - like do you people eat out of your sinks? I\u2019d rather someone put literal shit in my sink with a garbage disposal and a confined area than my bathing area.", "There\u2019s also a huge difference between baby shit and adult shit. Newborn babies barely have an intestinal flora, and all they have they got from the mother. So there\u2019s no chance of it being infectious, and as many have pointed out, raw meat is much more dangerous and yet it\u2019s done regularly. \n\nI would still do it in a utilities/laundry room sink instead of given the option, of course, but it\u2019s no big deal, and it certainly doesn\u2019t deserve an AH labeling on its own. The abusive insults do though, and I can\u2019t understand that you think they have the same weight. \n\nNTA", "Right. So. From the two sentences of the OP's paragraph you're able to divine his intent?  \n\n\nI'm Australian, so calling someone an idiot for doing something dumb is pretty standard, and not seen as at all abusive.  \n\n\nHow do you appropriately say to someone that what they've done is idiotic, without being abusive, but also conveying your upset emotional state? See the issue there.", "That sounds pretty smart to me!", "I recall my mom doing the same. The toilet water was already well disinfected with blocks etc and actually clean water from the cistern so all you were doing is clearing the flakes and crud off. \n\nThen it can be washed in a basin or soaked in a bucket.\n\nOp, your NTA for caring but I would try and find an alternate than using the kitchen sink. Your husband though...", "why not both? we can all forgive the tired mother for taking the first option available but everyone acting like putting poop in the sink is run-of-the mill stuff are deluding themselves.", "it won't make you ill as long as you sterilize it properly, which can be done. they also don't have a bathtub. or even a utility sink.", "the situation of an adult making the decision to shit on the carpet is nowhere near equivalent to using pretty much the only place they have to wash the clothes, which can be deep cleaned and sanitized. she's exhausted and getting no help with the baby. he had no right to treat her like that, and she really wasn't wrong based on the lack of options she had.", "op did. he doesn't help her.", "There\u2019s this thing called BLEACHING AND WASHING YOUR DAMN SINK ONCE A DAY? DO YOU NOT DO THAT?", "According to her story. I'll bet a dollar his side is vastly different.\n\nIn fact I'd bet another dollar that if HE would have posted the AITA first from his point of view the tables would turn.", "Pop off again. Lmao", "Yeah no- I do not bleach and wash my sink once a day are you on unemployment? No life? OCD? Who does that once a day? Who? Who are you bruh? Who cleans everything with bleach or does any cleaning once a day? No I don\u2019t, I clean up- but with \u201cbleach\u201d? No, I wipe crap down and rinse things. You \u201cclean with bleach\u201d specifically once a day, your sink?", "yeah, and you don't have any reason to believe he wouldn't lie his ass off. based on his reaction, he's obviously not a mentally well balanced person that can be relied on.", "You based that entire conclusion from a story someone told on the internet?", "based on that reaction, and the details provided. there are other comments detailing that he's abusive as well. this isn't an outlandish story by any means, and until there are more details or another side provided, there's no reason not to believe it."]}
