{"id": 22422, "submission_id": "151ahgn", "title": "AITA for soaking my baby\u2019s poop clothes in the kitchen sink?", "selftext": "So I am a first time mom to an 8 week old boy. I\u2019m lucky to have a non-fussy baby. He only really cries if he\u2019s super hungry. However, he has earned the nickname \u201cMr. Poop\u201d as he has the occasional poopsplosion. One of these happened last night. My husband was taking a nap last night as this all went down. I went to our kitchen to wash a couple bottles and I heard the baby fussing a bit in his bouncer. I come check on him to find half the bouncer pooped on along with the onesie he\u2019s wearing. I quickly removed his bouncer cloth and his clothes and took his diaper off and immediately gave him a bath. I put the soiled clothes into a plastic bag and left it to the side. Thankfully his bowel movements aren\u2019t too bad because he\u2019s a newborn still so they don\u2019t really smell, nonetheless it\u2019s still shit. After bathing him and feeding him I was exhausted (I don\u2019t get to nap during the day usually because my husband doesn\u2019t usually take over with taking care of the little guy-either during the day or night) so we went to bed. This morning I realized that I have to soak his clothes because I forgot to last night. So I put some hot water and detergent in the kitchen sink and let everything soak before I rinsed it. We went on a walk this morning and as we came back my husband got up and as soon as he saw the soaking clothes with the poop he lost his shit. He called me \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d and insane and started yelling at me pretty bad, asking me wtf is wrong with me etc. I honest to God was planning on bleaching the entire sink completely after the soak and I did end up doing so, but he said that it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m completely crazy and it was really dumb what I did. He said I should\u2019ve used a bucket outside instead but I honestly just did what I had to do as quickly as possible without having to leave the baby by himself inside. Now I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I should\u2019ve been more mindful and maybe it was stupid of me to use the kitchen sink\u2026 so, AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your input. I appreciate all the responses and comments, especially the other mothers who can sympathize with my impulsive decision. To answer a couple questions:\n\n1. Why not use a bathtub or utility sink? We only have a shower and we live in the back house of a big property where there is no washer or dryer, or utility sink. \n\n2. Does my husband often speak to me this way? It happens every once in a while. He\u2019s never put his hands on me but he has a mean temper and can name call. He was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder last year when he went to the psychiatric hospital, and put on Abilify. The medication helped a lot but made him much more sleepy/tired. He still loses his temper at times. We used to go to counseling and have weekly marriage meetings which we stopped due to complacency.", "created_utc": 1689524721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151ahgn/aita_for_soaking_my_babys_poop_clothes_in_the/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Newborns poop a lot, but not necessarily all at once. Maybe try feeding more frequently, but smaller quantities at a time. Also, your partner doesn't sound like a very nice person.

However, your husband's behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and inexcusable. I'm sure he's also tired, but that's no excuse. He needs to find somewhere else to go for a few days to consider his life, before he comes back and apologizes. Then he needs therapy. You just gave him a baby. Seriously.", "NTA, while having poopy diapers in the kitchen sink probably seems icky to many people because the kitchen is used to prepare food, his reaction was over the top ridiculous. He could have calmly told you that he thought it was gross and please use a bucket next time. But as long as the sink was cleaned afterwards, there's no actual risk to anyone. I mean, unless you are vegetarians, you have probably used the kitchen sink numerous times to clean up after preparing raw chicken, which is full of nasty bacteria and probably more far dangerous that baby poop. However, it's fine because dish soap is extremely effective at killing bacteria.", "Yikes where to start.\n\nFirst NTA, you did nothing wrong. Your first priority is that your baby is safe, fed, clean and rested. Everything else takes a backseat to this.\n\nSecondly, your husband has no right to treat you that way. Especially since he is being a complete deadbeat when it comes to child care. This isn't the 50's. Talk to him, try to get him to go to therapy, him yelling and insulting you is only adding undue stress to a crummy situation.\n\nThirdly, baby poop for the first few months is mostly water soluble if the baby is breast fed.

I normally wake up with our son around 4:30am and stay with him to let mommy sleep as much as possible before I have to leave for work. When I come home my first instinct is to ask her how can I help her and take care of everything I can to give her a break.

Otherwise, he berates and belittles you for having brain fog.\n\nThis behavior is abusive, unnecessary, and misogynistic *at best*. You need to tell a woman in his life about this or he\u2019ll keep it up.", "NTA. You\u2019re a new mom and learning as you go. You have a newborn child and are a bit frazzled right now. I see nothing wrong with what you did especially since you planned on scouring the sink afterwards. I\u2019m not even going to go into my opinion of the person you chose to bring children into this world with\u2026\u2026.", "NTA.\n\nIs your husband even helping? You sound exhausted. There is nothing wrong with washing soiled diapers in the sink. You just clean it after with bleach. People suggested the tub, which is more difficult (lots of bending over), wastes more water, and is larger to clean afterwards. Sinks are smaller and make more sense for one diaper.", "NTA any parent who has been there can fully understand. Your husband is abusive and should never have said that. He needs to apologize.", "NTA. Would that have been my chosen location to soak a poop mess? No. But not being the best location doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA - It was a gross thing to do, but that doesn't make you an AH. Calling you what he did makes him a hardcore AH though. It sounds like he barely helps and yells at you. Yikes. That's not a good partner.", "NTA kitchen sink is multi task device, it can also be cleaned throughly.", "There are 2 huge factors at play here. Lets start with, AH is a pretty strong term. I think it's gross that you did that, let's be real, poop and food don't mix. Put it in the bathroom sink /bathtub, outside, etc.. in plain terms of right or wrong, I think on this issue, you were wrong. \n\nNow let's get to the flaming elephant in the room, and that's your husband. Regardless of the situation, there is no reason to treat your partner like he did. The stress of having a baby isn't small, and he isn't helping at all. He is absolutly the asshole for how he reacted, and you need to have a sit down with him immediately to address your concerns without anyone raising their voice. If it devolved into him yelling, walk away.\nNow you have 2 choices either schedule a couples therapy or file for divorce. Because the current situation is not ok and you can choose to stay, but your child can't. And since you already have a child, you have no choice but to do one of those two things to protect your child.", "Personally I would avoid using the kitchen sink but you did what you had to do in the moment. I\u2019m assuming this is your first and you\u2019re still figuring it all out. Of course you were going to fully sanitize the sink afterwards because you\u2019re actually a sensible adult human but going forward it might make your life easier to get a cheap plastic bin from the dollar store for soaking poopy clothes.\n\nYou\u2019re husband is throwing up some major red flags with his response though. This is a vulnerable time for you and often when abusive partners begin or escalate their behaviour. Please take care of yourself and your little one. I hope you have a support system in place (besides husband who doesn\u2019t seem to be helpful at all) so you can get some much needed rest.", "There are 2 ways this cold go with me.

Please seek help.", "NTA.Wait until he realizes we reuse water in the world and that it\u2019s filtered but technically ur drinking fish human whatever fecal matter. It\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s house y\u2019all\u2019s baby and if you clean it it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re you supposed to use the washing machine? He would\u2019ve complained there\u2019s poop in there too. Our phones are dirtier than a toilet I say scientifically it\u2019s fine and he is overreacting. Sure you could do it in the bathroom sink but most kitchen sinks are two sided so you can at least use the other part. A bucket in the outside in summer with an 8 week old isn\u2019t accessible. Seriously hope he was having a bad day and isn\u2019t usually like that.", "   ** THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART** \n        PLEASE I'M TALKING TO YOU BIR AS A STRANGER ON THE INTERNET BUT MOM TO MOM WOMAN TO WOMAN.

BUT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, SMART, AND EORTHY OF SOOOO MUCH MORE THAN HE IS GIVING YOU. HE HAS TO KEEP YOU FEELING BAD ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE IF YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN WORTH HES AFARID YOU'LL REAKIZE WHAT A LOSER HE IS. I KNOW ITS HARD TO LIVE YOURSELF AND BELIEVE WHAT IM SAYING.

And people like him are trained professionals. They cultivate and hone the skills required to gain control over and manipulate people because they know they're inferior to \"normal\" people. \n\n       As has been said, you my dear are not the AH. You are an over tired, over worked, brand new momma still figuring things out. I personally would've preferred to use the bathtub. It's not that much better but at least there's no food being prepped in it. But as you said you planned on and did indeed bleach the Hell out of it. So... Shit happens. \n\n       I know I am just a stranger on the internet but I'm a lot more than that as well. One of those things is a DV survivor. I'm sure you probably know this but you're in a abusive relationship. All couple fight. NOT all husbands  call their wives/mother of their  children awful names. He didn't even stop there he continued to berate you afterwards. He might not hit you but he might in the future.", "As others have said. NTA. You sound like you are carrying a lot and 8.weeks into a newborn baby is not the period the best decisions are made. But empathy is what is needed. It's not the worst thing people have done with kitchen sinks I am sure and tbh baby poop ends up everywhere. I hope your husband also helps with nappy changes!", "My kids are teens but back then we use to bathe them in the kitchen sink. Everyone did. Sooner or later little floaters came along. The sink was always bleached before and after bath time. It just wasn\u2019t an issue. You did nothing wrong.", "Your husband is an abusive AH.", "NTA but your husband is. He doesn\u2019t help with the baby (it does not matter what his job is or how hard he works) and is, at a minimum, verbally abusive. You have a newborn on your hands and he does less than the bare minimum a dad should do and adds to your stress on top. I\u2019m so sorry this is your kid\u2019s dad.", "So I think washing poopy clothes in the kitchen sink is gross and a no-no - my bigger concern for you sweetie is how your husband spoke to you. Calling you names and screaming at you is not even SLIGHTLY ok. Even if YOU pooped in the sink (which is gross please don\u2019t). \n\nYou are providing the sole care to a brand new human - that man is HORRIFIC to speak to you that way \u2764\ufe0f I don\u2019t even know you but I can promise you that is NOT ok - not ever \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "I\u2019m personally a bit of a germaphobe and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with poop in the kitchen sink.

However, I would express that to my significant other in a normal way, by asking that they please don\u2019t do it again for my sake.\n\n\nNone of this matters, of course. *His verbal abuse makes him the asshole regardless.* NTA, and take care of yourself. He sure as hell doesn\u2019t seem to be taking care of you.", "I used to give my baby her bath in the sink!   I would sterilize it before and after.  It was hard for me to bend over to reach the bath tub after my c-section.  \n\nNTA and tell your husband to chill.", "ESH\n\nOK- not really an ESH. I understand you were tired but maybe kitchen sink was not the best idea. It\u2019s pretty disgusting to think that poop\u2019s been in there even if it\u2019s been bleached and then your dishes have been in there. But your husband is an ABSOLUTE AH. There was no need to yell- especially since he refuses to take responsibility of the baby. His language is emotionally abusive and you should set down some ground rules so you get to rest because you honestly sound overworked.", "ESH\n\nUse the bathroom sink. Or tub. Poop in the kitchen sink is just gross.\n\nAt the same time, he shouldn't have yelled at you or called you those things.", "NTA\n\nYou need to les d this guy. It\u2019s not normal to yell, swear at your spouse and call them brain dead. There is a lot  going on here with him. He doesn\u2019t respect or value you during a time he should be worshiping the ground you walk on.\n\nI\u2019m sorry honey.", "I'm trying to see it from his side.

I never put my baby\u2019s poop splosion clothing in a kitchen sink. I used the tub, then massively BLEACHED it immediately, and it\u2019s understandable in your exhaustion that you forgot them in the bag.  The kitchen sink is used for food and dishes that also come into contact with food. That is not only disgusting but a serious health issue. Husband could have done better. Calling you brain dead was over the top. He could have asked to do it himself, or asked if you needed a hand, but like a lot of men these days, they shrug off their wives feelings and have diarrhea of the mouth and letting anything and everything they think fly out of it. You aren\u2019t STUPID, you just need to sit and talk with the husband and tell him your feelings. Let him tell you how he feels and y\u2019all both don\u2019t need to get heated about it; as soon as it does, end the discussion with an apology. Just try to remember next time- USE THE TUB! and take care of it asap.", "Yes that\u2019s gross asf I would\u2019ve taken the poop clothes outside just me tho", "YTa-that's Gross, but your husband is a bigger AH for talking to you like that.", "That\u2019s pretty gross but your husband sounds awful", "Your husband is an ass, and maybe you're not an asshole, BUT that's fucking vile.", "You nasty M.... YTA.", "Yes.", "Both are the asshole. YTA for soaking shit covered clothes in the kitchen sink but he's a bigger asshole for the way he reacted", "You're moreso just being super, super fucking stupid instead of an asshole. But you are an asshole for not understanding that they will need to fix it and pay for it when it gets gunked up with shit and piss, not you. It reeks bad, just dont use the sink. Id recommend saying you're sorry at least or this will become a regular thing and you 2 will 100% separate.", "NTA", "You\u2019re not an asshole, crazy or stupid. You\u2019re tending to a newborn and you\u2019re recovering from birth.\n\nHowever, especially long-term, I\u2019d advise against it. Especially if you food prep in the sink. The cross-contamination could be dangerous.\n\nWhat I used to do when my baby was having blow-outs, is scrub the clothing with a laundry soap to get all of the immediate dirt out and hopefully not stain, let it air dry and then leave it with the rest of the baby laundry to be put in the washer.", "The only things you did wrong was use hot water, (& marry this guy maybe). Do you eat out of your sink? No,  rinse what you need to rinse,  cold to rinse stains (hot will set,  including the dryer,  never dry anything until you're sure the stain is out,  and dawn is great for stains,  you're right there at the sink!). Then wash your sink with hot water. You're doing great,  mama. As a side,  Find a trauma therapist. You'll need it.", "NTA. Sounds like he needs to step up and be a dad. I have 3 kids. I've soaked poop clothes wherever I needed to. It sucks. But you clean the sink after wards with bleach and move on with life.", "NTA I scrub and soak all stained or dirty laundry in the kitchen basin. \nAnd more than once washed the kids in it too. \nSinks are fully cleanable and the way he spoke you was not cool.", "NTA\n\nYou have an ass for a husband who can't be bothered to be a parent. If he didn't like where you were washing them HE could have taken them outside to clean in the bucket.", "He\u2019s the AH not you. He sounds pretty lazy to boot. Why doesn\u2019t he help you with the baby? It\u2019s both of your baby not just yours. Sounds like he needs an attitude adjustment.", "I would not put poop in the kitchen sink, but under your circumstances, totally understandable. You are NTA, but your husband is THE biggest AH for not helping out and for yelling at you and for calling you names. He needs to pitch in more and be more considerate with his feedback. I\u2019m sorry, OP, for your useless spouse. I will never understand how childcare is only limited to one parent. I don\u2019t care who makes the money.", "Nta. The sink thing gives me the ick but the way your husband treated you is fucked up. And he's not even helping you care for the baby? I'd consider my options tbh. Good luck mama", "NTA, and judging by your husbands over-the-top reaction I want to echo many other commenters and say that your husband either needs to step up and help around the house and with the baby - plus be a lot kinder to you - or I recommend you re-evaluate your options. \n\nNewborns strain every relationship. It\u2019s a huge shift of priorities and lifestyle. Hubby may not be onboard as of yet. If he doesn\u2019t come around, it\u2019s time to shop around.", "why?  (think risk/benefit ratio)\nme, i figga i can buy a $5 5 gal bucket at the hardware store and move everything to bathroom-shower.", "I'm not going to sugarcoat this: Your husband is verbally abusive and deliberately negligent of yours AND the baby's needs. Please seek help or leave. It sounds like he just wants the trophy wife and kid without having to do any work into keeping them. This is not healthy for you, and frankly, you need a break. It's hard being the only caretaker and trying to do it on a lack of sleep. Reach out to literally any mom groups or a marriage and family therapist. I don't care what your husband tells you. You deserve so much better, and so does your very young child.", "YTA.  \n\n\nThe way your husband acted was not okay, not sure I'd go so far to call it abusive. How would you behave if someone left a turd on your kitchen bench? Not nicely.  \n Don't shit where you eat is hygiene basics. I'm going to assume you don't have a large enough bathroom sink/laundry.  \n\n\nDon't need to use a bucket outside, just use a bucket, put it in the bathroom.", "Tbh I would prob act like him, when I usually call someone dumb or brain dead, I don\u2019t actually mean it, I just want to convey just how stupid their action was. But when I say that I don\u2019t scream I just sound a little angry and a little sarcastic. Nonetheless why tf would u do it in the kitchen sink. Don\u2019t do that shit again please, those plates are sacred and it\u2019s the same reason why we brush our teeth in the BATHROOM SINK.", "Leave please. He is abusive. I only think this will escalate.", "Omg NTA! \n\nFirst off- sinks are meant for washing things. Even better, You mentioned yourself you would disinfect it afterwords which is perfect. No mistake here. \n\nSecondly- no one, especially not your spouse and person helping you raise your child should be cursing at you that way or talking to you that way. Even if it was a mistake. (It's not,) You deserve better OP and to be talked to respectfully. Even more.... If that is the way he responds to anger or something going awry, (bc things go awry and messy when you have kids all the time and kids put gross things in places they shouldn't because they don't know better), is he going to react the same? This could traumatize the kid and also be an example that can encourage anger in the future...... \n\nHow long have you been married? Does he react like this often? I am not sure, but if there is a pattern here... it may warrant a more difficult conversation. If this was a one time thing, Please have a talk with him if you feel comfortable and if this anger is consistent and becoming a pattern, counseling and/or more drastic measures may be more appropriate.", "Use the toilet. I wouldn't want any poo in the kitchen", "I wouldve reacted the same way, but i realize it is too harsh. However, this is disgusting even if you bleach the sink: you put shit somewhere you put dishes you eat from and drink water. \n\nWhat you did was really dumb so light YTA but your husband has to realize after a baby everything will be gross, i just feel the one place you definitely shouldnt wash shitty clothes is the kitchen sink. The bucket idea makes more sense however.", "Honestly, some people may not use kitchen sink for this. I would not prefer it. But then, literally shit happens.\n\nBut most importantly, most people are not utter garbage like OP's husband. \n\nNTA OP - your husband is an asshole for the way he reacted, though", "Not only that but she took the baby for a walk while the husband was still sleeping. Prince Charming is getting heaps of beauty sleep but since beauty comes from the inside, it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping him.", "Seriously not acceptable behavior to call someone (especially the mother of your child) \u201cf\u2019ing brain dead\u201d. \nSo it\u2019s ok to wash your baby\u2019s bum in the sink (most moms do) but not soak the poopy clothes? I understand it would be gross to leave the dishes in there while doing it but it doesn\u2019t sound like that was the case. \nNext time that husband should be in charge of cleaning the poopy clothes (if he knows better). It doesn\u2019t sound like he helps much cause otherwise he would know how hectic life is with a newborn and occasionally, out of lack of sleep, energy and time, you might do something that doesn\u2019t make sense to people who don\u2019t need to deal with a newborn. And hey.. newborn\u2019s poop is obviously not as harmful as the regular poop. Babies are born without gut bacteria and it doesn\u2019t reach the diversity level of adults gut bacteria before their first year.", "Nta. This comment is correct OP. You should consider leaving your abuser. Things like this only escalate.  The fact that you are questioning yourself instead of being mad that he not only is verbally abusing you he also doesn't contribute to raising his child is scary. May as well leave now. It just goes down hill from here.", "Exactly..people acting like they never had raw meat in their sink. That's fucking terrible too but I'm sure people do it", "What works better is AH saying to her \u201cyou look exhausted. I will look after our child while you get some sleep. Next time, just wake me up and I\u2019ll come and help\u201d", "Breastfed babies can go days without pooping. And then 3-4 days worth comes out all at once. It's completely normal, and sometimes causes messes.\n\nOne shouldn't restrict a baby in their eating especially if from the breast.

You really need to be told this???", "YES he is.   Bleach will clean the sink easily.", "That\u2019s what BLEACH is for. She\u2019s a new mom.

That is what was soaking.", "If baby poop is same as raw meat, you will cook the poop and eat it?", "In the 70s and 80s when everyone used cloth, sink was used all the time.  We were also bathed in it too including blowouts, In addition also where pantyhose and few other clothes were cleaned as well.  Hell when we need to do a bleach sanitize of rags/clothes because my son is a mess and stains shirts still, we still use the sink because fuck filling the tub up full of bleach and run the risk of your younger kids or animals getting into it. Also a huge waste of water and bleach in a tub.", "Almost everyone bathes small babies in the sink too. It\u2019s called bleaching it after.", "Can you go stay with your mom?
