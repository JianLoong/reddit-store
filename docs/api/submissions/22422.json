{"id": 22422, "submission_id": "151ahgn", "title": "AITA for soaking my baby\u2019s poop clothes in the kitchen sink?", "selftext": "So I am a first time mom to an 8 week old boy. I\u2019m lucky to have a non-fussy baby. He only really cries if he\u2019s super hungry. However, he has earned the nickname \u201cMr. Poop\u201d as he has the occasional poopsplosion. One of these happened last night. My husband was taking a nap last night as this all went down. I went to our kitchen to wash a couple bottles and I heard the baby fussing a bit in his bouncer. I come check on him to find half the bouncer pooped on along with the onesie he\u2019s wearing. I quickly removed his bouncer cloth and his clothes and took his diaper off and immediately gave him a bath. I put the soiled clothes into a plastic bag and left it to the side. Thankfully his bowel movements aren\u2019t too bad because he\u2019s a newborn still so they don\u2019t really smell, nonetheless it\u2019s still shit. After bathing him and feeding him I was exhausted (I don\u2019t get to nap during the day usually because my husband doesn\u2019t usually take over with taking care of the little guy-either during the day or night) so we went to bed. This morning I realized that I have to soak his clothes because I forgot to last night. So I put some hot water and detergent in the kitchen sink and let everything soak before I rinsed it. We went on a walk this morning and as we came back my husband got up and as soon as he saw the soaking clothes with the poop he lost his shit. He called me \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d and insane and started yelling at me pretty bad, asking me wtf is wrong with me etc. I honest to God was planning on bleaching the entire sink completely after the soak and I did end up doing so, but he said that it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m completely crazy and it was really dumb what I did. He said I should\u2019ve used a bucket outside instead but I honestly just did what I had to do as quickly as possible without having to leave the baby by himself inside. Now I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I should\u2019ve been more mindful and maybe it was stupid of me to use the kitchen sink\u2026 so, AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your input. I appreciate all the responses and comments, especially the other mothers who can sympathize with my impulsive decision. To answer a couple questions:\n\n1. Why not use a bathtub or utility sink? We only have a shower and we live in the back house of a big property where there is no washer or dryer, or utility sink. \n\n2. Does my husband often speak to me this way? It happens every once in a while. He\u2019s never put his hands on me but he has a mean temper and can name call. He was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder last year when he went to the psychiatric hospital, and put on Abilify. The medication helped a lot but made him much more sleepy/tired. He still loses his temper at times. We used to go to counseling and have weekly marriage meetings which we stopped due to complacency. We\u2019ve been married for 1.5 years, together almost 6 years. This is our only child.\n\n3. Did you end up cleaning the sick afterwards? Yes I bleached it twice and scrubbed the literally shit out of it and threw out the sponge I used.", "created_utc": 1689524721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151ahgn/aita_for_soaking_my_babys_poop_clothes_in_the/", "score": 500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mistakes will be made, but you're learning from them, so job well done. Suggestion, you might be feeding your newborn too much, or check the fit of your diapers as they could be a size too big. Newborns poop a lot, but not necessarily all at once. Maybe try feeding more frequently, but smaller quantities at a time. Also, your partner doesn't sound like a very nice person. He should be more understanding and forgiving. His over the top reaction was unbelievably mean.

You are tired, you are only 2 months postpartum. You planned to clean the kitchen sink after, and that's fine. It's not like you soaked it with the lettuce. However, your husband's behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and inexcusable. I'm sure he's also tired, but that's no excuse. He needs to find somewhere else to go for a few days to consider his life, before he comes back and apologizes. Then he needs therapy. You just gave him a baby. Seriously.", "NTA, while having poopy diapers in the kitchen sink probably seems icky to many people because the kitchen is used to prepare food, his reaction was over the top ridiculous. He could have calmly told you that he thought it was gross and please use a bucket next time. But as long as the sink was cleaned afterwards, there's no actual risk to anyone. I mean, unless you are vegetarians, you have probably used the kitchen sink numerous times to clean up after preparing raw chicken, which is full of nasty bacteria and probably more far dangerous that baby poop. However, it's fine because dish soap is extremely effective at killing bacteria.", "Yikes where to start.\n\nFirst NTA, you did nothing wrong. Your first priority is that your baby is safe, fed, clean and rested. Everything else takes a backseat to this.\n\nSecondly, your husband has no right to treat you that way. Especially since he is being a complete deadbeat when it comes to child care. This isn't the 50's. Talk to him, try to get him to go to therapy, him yelling and insulting you is only adding undue stress to a crummy situation.\n\nThirdly, baby poop for the first few months is mostly water soluble if the baby is breast fed.

We decided to split roles to help with all the baby stuff and I do 90% of the cooking and kitchen cleaning. I normally wake up with our son around 4:30am and stay with him to let mommy sleep as much as possible before I have to leave for work. When I come home my first instinct is to ask her how can I help her and take care of everything I can to give her a break.

Don\u2019t give him the chance to hurt you or your baby \u2764\ufe0f", "Your husband sounds like he\u2019s okay with you doing all the work to raise your newborn as long as he\u2019s controlling and telling you how to do it. Otherwise, he berates and belittles you for having brain fog.\n\nThis behavior is abusive, unnecessary, and misogynistic *at best*. You need to tell a woman in his life about this or he\u2019ll keep it up.", "NTA. You\u2019re a new mom and learning as you go. You have a newborn child and are a bit frazzled right now. I see nothing wrong with what you did especially since you planned on scouring the sink afterwards. I\u2019m not even going to go into my opinion of the person you chose to bring children into this world with\u2026\u2026.", "NTA.\n\nIs your husband even helping? You sound exhausted. There is nothing wrong with washing soiled diapers in the sink. You just clean it after with bleach. People suggested the tub, which is more difficult (lots of bending over), wastes more water, and is larger to clean afterwards. Sinks are smaller and make more sense for one diaper.", "NTA any parent who has been there can fully understand. Your husband is abusive and should never have said that. He needs to apologize.", "NTA. Would that have been my chosen location to soak a poop mess? No. But not being the best location doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA - It was a gross thing to do, but that doesn't make you an AH. Calling you what he did makes him a hardcore AH though. It sounds like he barely helps and yells at you. Yikes. That's not a good partner.", "NTA kitchen sink is multi task device, it can also be cleaned throughly.", "There are 2 huge factors at play here. Lets start with, AH is a pretty strong term. I think it's gross that you did that, let's be real, poop and food don't mix. Put it in the bathroom sink /bathtub, outside, etc.. in plain terms of right or wrong, I think on this issue, you were wrong. \n\nNow let's get to the flaming elephant in the room, and that's your husband. Regardless of the situation, there is no reason to treat your partner like he did. The stress of having a baby isn't small, and he isn't helping at all. He is absolutly the asshole for how he reacted, and you need to have a sit down with him immediately to address your concerns without anyone raising their voice. If it devolved into him yelling, walk away.\nNow you have 2 choices either schedule a couples therapy or file for divorce. Because the current situation is not ok and you can choose to stay, but your child can't. And since you already have a child, you have no choice but to do one of those two things to protect your child.", "Personally I would avoid using the kitchen sink but you did what you had to do in the moment. I\u2019m assuming this is your first and you\u2019re still figuring it all out. Of course you were going to fully sanitize the sink afterwards because you\u2019re actually a sensible adult human but going forward it might make your life easier to get a cheap plastic bin from the dollar store for soaking poopy clothes.\n\nYou\u2019re husband is throwing up some major red flags with his response though. This is a vulnerable time for you and often when abusive partners begin or escalate their behaviour. Please take care of yourself and your little one. I hope you have a support system in place (besides husband who doesn\u2019t seem to be helpful at all) so you can get some much needed rest.", "There are 2 ways this cold go with me.  Someone elses kitchen sink and I'd disagree.  This was your kitchen sink so NTA.  You know how to clean your home sink properly.", "Nope!\nJust sterilize it after.", "He sounds abusive.

He would\u2019ve complained there\u2019s poop in there too. Our phones are dirtier than a toilet I say scientifically it\u2019s fine and he is overreacting. Sure you could do it in the bathroom sink but most kitchen sinks are two sided so you can at least use the other part. A bucket in the outside in summer with an 8 week old isn\u2019t accessible.

You are an over tired, over worked, brand new momma still figuring things out. I personally would've preferred to use the bathtub. It's not that much better but at least there's no food being prepped in it. But as you said you planned on and did indeed bleach the Hell out of it. So... Shit happens. \n\n       I know I am just a stranger on the internet but I'm a lot more than that as well. One of those things is a DV survivor. I'm sure you probably know this but you're in a abusive relationship. All couple fight. NOT all husbands  call their wives/mother of their  children awful names.

I hope your husband also helps with nappy changes!", "My kids are teens but back then we use to bathe them in the kitchen sink. Everyone did. Sooner or later little floaters came along.

I understand you were tired but maybe kitchen sink was not the best idea. It\u2019s pretty disgusting to think that poop\u2019s been in there even if it\u2019s been bleached and then your dishes have been in there. But your husband is an ABSOLUTE AH.

His language is emotionally abusive and you should set down some ground rules so you get to rest because you honestly sound overworked.", "ESH\n\nUse the bathroom sink. Or tub.

I never put my baby\u2019s poop splosion clothing in a kitchen sink. I used the tub, then massively BLEACHED it immediately, and it\u2019s understandable in your exhaustion that you forgot them in the bag.  The kitchen sink is used for food and dishes that also come into contact with food. That is not only disgusting but a serious health issue. Husband could have done better. Calling you brain dead was over the top. He could have asked to do it himself, or asked if you needed a hand, but like a lot of men these days, they shrug off their wives feelings and have diarrhea of the mouth and letting anything and everything they think fly out of it. You aren\u2019t STUPID, you just need to sit and talk with the husband and tell him your feelings. Let him tell you how he feels and y\u2019all both don\u2019t need to get heated about it; as soon as it does, end the discussion with an apology.

Good luck mama", "NTA, and judging by your husbands over-the-top reaction I want to echo many other commenters and say that your husband either needs to step up and help around the house and with the baby - plus be a lot kinder to you - or I recommend you re-evaluate your options. \n\nNewborns strain every relationship.

(It's not,) You deserve better OP and to be talked to respectfully. Even more.... If that is the way he responds to anger or something going awry, (bc things go awry and messy when you have kids all the time and kids put gross things in places they shouldn't because they don't know better), is he going to react the same? This could traumatize the kid and also be an example that can encourage anger in the future......\n\nHow long have you been married? Does he react like this often? I am not sure, but if there is a pattern here it can be abuse and something you may not want to get you, or your child further involved in. If this was a one time thing, it is still not acceptable to react that way and if he is struggling with anger, he should be going to therapy and not taking it out on you. Please have a talk with him if you feel comfortable and if this anger is consistent and becoming a pattern, counseling and/or more drastic measures may be more appropriate.

The bucket idea makes more sense however.", "Honestly, some people may not use kitchen sink for this. I would not prefer it.

Is this what you want them to perceive as normal? Do you want them to grow up and treat people this way, because they think it's normal? Or for them to go entirely in the other direction, and end up in an even more abusive situation because they assume it's normal?\n\nYou made a mistake. It's not the end of the world. We all make them. What's more concerning is raising a child with a person who clearly doesn't value or respect you (or their child).", "A real good mentor for the child OPs husband is while she is single-handedly raising him. Jesus he sounds awful. She's trying to hold it together- while trying to not only heal her own body but take care of her newborn what sounds like single-handedly while her asshole husband is name calling and getting his beauty sleep. Next time wash the baby's diaper in his cereal bowl, and kick his ass to the curb. You know why? Because in a few years your kid will start to learn from his awful behavior and that's how he's going to treat a woman in his future. I honestly could care less about women who put up with men who treat them terribly because to each their own and if they want to stay it's not my place to say. *HOWEVER*, once that woman has a child, she has a responsibility to make sure he's raised to become a good person and that means not learning to treat women like that. Get out of there or he will raise your son to believe that's okay and do that to another woman.", "She obviously doesn't deserve to be emotionally abused over it but let's not suddenly act like it isn't disgusting. There's a post on this page about some guy pissing in his sister's sink and everyone is talking about how disgusting that is.

It wasn\u2019t an ideal place, but it sounds like she went with the easiest option available.", "Just bc they can be cleaned doesn't mean you do it. Next thing you know she puts the poop in a bowl, clean it and then eat out of that plate. Normal right?", "Say it to the guy who peed I\u2019m the sink and everybody was saying he was disgusting", "Take the shitty child to the bathroom. I mean, Jesus Christ, how bad is this household?

She can take the child to the bathroom. Truly not much to ask.", "As someone already said the shock of seeing something this disgusting could easily provoke overreacting.
