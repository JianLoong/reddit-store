I\u2019m lucky to have a non-fussy baby. He only really cries if he\u2019s super hungry. However, he has earned the nickname \u201cMr. Poop\u201d as he has the occasional poopsplosion. One of these happened last night. My husband was taking a nap last night as this all went down. I went to our kitchen to wash a couple bottles and I heard the baby fussing a bit in his bouncer. I come check on him to find half the bouncer pooped on along with the onesie he\u2019s wearing. I quickly removed his bouncer cloth and his clothes and took his diaper off and immediately gave him a bath. I put the soiled clothes into a plastic bag and left it to the side. Thankfully his bowel movements aren\u2019t too bad because he\u2019s a newborn still so they don\u2019t really smell, nonetheless it\u2019s still shit. After bathing him and feeding him I was exhausted (I don\u2019t get to nap during the day usually because my husband doesn\u2019t usually take over with taking care of the little guy-either during the day or night) so we went to bed. This morning I realized that I have to soak his clothes because I forgot to last night. So I put some hot water and detergent in the kitchen sink and let everything soak before I rinsed it. We went on a walk this morning and as we came back my husband got up and as soon as he saw the soaking clothes with the poop he lost his shit. He called me \u201cfucking brain dead\u201d and insane and started yelling at me pretty bad, asking me wtf is wrong with me etc. I honest to God was planning on bleaching the entire sink completely after the soak and I did end up doing so, but he said that it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m completely crazy and it was really dumb what I did. He said I should\u2019ve used a bucket outside instead but I honestly just did what I had to do as quickly as possible without having to leave the baby by himself inside. Now I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I should\u2019ve been more mindful and maybe it was stupid of me to use the kitchen sink\u2026 so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689524721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151ahgn/aita_for_soaking_my_babys_poop_clothes_in_the/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's hard work being so, so tired.\n\nKitchen sink, no I wouldn't, but it doesn't make you an AH.\n\nI hope he becomes a little more (by this I mean a lot) more supportive so you can get a little sleep and rest. Good luck with your newborn.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband is a massive abusive, lazy, negligent AH", "NTA. Sinks are fully sterilizable. Your husband is an abusive asshole though. This is something so minor that screaming and insulting you is all the more absurd. Consider getting some support and leaving this dynamic.", "NTA. The kitchen sink isn't sacred. It's a sink like any other. As long as you're cleaning it, it's fine.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't advise that your husband is acting like an asshole in his own right. Not helping with the baby is bad enough; calling you \"braindead\" and other such insults is unacceptable. He needs to have an ounce of respect and compassion for his partner. Stand up for yourself and have a conversation about his behavior.\n\nA few years from now, is he going to be insulting your toddler like that? Nip his bullshit in the bud now.", "NTA if it is disinfected afterward. Sinks should be disinfected regularly anyway, poop or not. Which is maybe something HE should be doing?", "NTA\n\nI personally would have an issue with the kitchen sink for this purpose as well and wouldn\u2019t recommend it\u2026 BUT you are an exhausted mom and there\u2019s absolutely zero reasons to yell at you like this. Anything but having a calm discussion about the pros and cons of soaking poop clothes in kitchen sinks is out of line. Your husband sounds like he has severe anger issues and in a calm moment I would address this with him and set a firm boundary that this type of behavior is unacceptable.", "Get rid of your husband", "NTA\n\nYes, shit is nasty. Yes, we wash dishes in the sink. I bet a lot of people here also rinse their chicken in the sink, which is arguably nastier than shit, especially newborn shit, which is pretty benign. \n\nYour husband is an asshole for talking to his newborn child's tired and physically traumatized mother like that. Next time he has a problem with how you handle something to do with the baby, let him do it. \n\nAnd if he continues this kind of behavior, you probably need to leave.", "NTA, your husband certainly is though. It's a sink. Bleach works on it. Yeah, a bucket would have been better, but shit literally happens! It sounds like you also didn't feel like you could call him to get a bucket going, so he can deal with the consequences of his not helping or taking over.", "NTA, and I'd also like to add, your husband, f*ck that guy! Until he starts helping around the house with the baby, etc. he's not entitled to any goddamn opinions about how you take care of baby and assorted baby things. Sinks are dirty, washing machines are dirty, bathtubs are dirty, it's why there is an industry of cleaning products, he needs to get over himself.", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t soak anything like that in the sink. Would do it in a tub or large container. I still think you\u2019re NTA. \n\nIf baby is having so many explosions, you may want to up the diaper size or try another brand. That\u2019s the only time I think my baby every had an explosion\u2014 when it was time to move up a size or the diaper wasn\u2019t quite right for her as she has a very long butt/torso.

The question is not if you should soak poop on the sink or not, the question is how in hell does your husband think it's ok to yell or insult you. Is this something that happens often?\n\nThis not ok. This is worrying.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA, but your husband is. Wtf? A simple \" hey that's kinda gross, I'll go buy a clean bucket\" works far better.", "NTA - You're doing your best without any experience, little sleep and sounds like not much (it any) support from your partner. Mistakes will be made, but you're learning from them, so job well done. Suggestion, you might be feeding your newborn too much, or check the fit of your diapers as they could be a size too big. Newborns poop a lot, but not necessarily all at once. Maybe try feeding more frequently, but smaller quantities at a time. Also, your partner doesn't sound like a very nice person. He should be more understanding and forgiving. His over the top reaction was unbelievably mean. Not knowing the full ramifications of your situation, I don't want to make assumptions, but based on the info you shared he gives off major AH vibes. Take care and be kind to yourself.", "What kind of husband completely loses it with his wife and the mother his 8 week old child? Does he often yell at you like this? Because it sounds pretty abusive. \n\nNTA but you might wanna get a tub specially for rinsing poopy clothes, this is gonna happen a whole lot more!", "Nta that brain dead comment would have me seeking a lawyer, divorce, and allllll the assets. You have a new born. Idc how tired he is coz his tackle hasn\u2019t been split in half.", "NTA - Run far and fast, because he\u2019s never going to be a partner or parent.", "NTA. You are tired, you are only 2 months postpartum. You planned to clean the kitchen sink after, and that's fine. It's not like you soaked it with the lettuce. However, your husband's behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and inexcusable. I'm sure he's also tired, but that's no excuse. He needs to find somewhere else to go for a few days to consider his life, before he comes back and apologizes. Then he needs therapy. You just gave him a baby. Seriously.", "NTA, while having poopy diapers in the kitchen sink probably seems icky to many people because the kitchen is used to prepare food, his reaction was over the top ridiculous. He could have calmly told you that he thought it was gross and please use a bucket next time. But as long as the sink was cleaned afterwards, there's no actual risk to anyone. I mean, unless you are vegetarians, you have probably used the kitchen sink numerous times to clean up after preparing raw chicken, which is full of nasty bacteria and probably more far dangerous that baby poop. However, it's fine because dish soap is extremely effective at killing bacteria.", "Yikes where to start.\n\nFirst NTA, you did nothing wrong. Your first priority is that your baby is safe, fed, clean and rested. Everything else takes a backseat to this.\n\nSecondly, your husband has no right to treat you that way. Especially since he is being a complete deadbeat when it comes to child care. This isn't the 50's. Talk to him, try to get him to go to therapy, him yelling and insulting you is only adding undue stress to a crummy situation.\n\nThirdly, baby poop for the first few months is mostly water soluble if the baby is breast fed. So it's not even an issue.

This gets rid of most of the mess, and the clothing can then go into the washer under a sterilize cycle.", "NTA - your husband shouldn\u2019t be talking to you that way", "While I think maybe a bucket could\u2019ve been a better idea, your husband is the asshole for speaking to you that way. I\u2019d set a boundary with him to not talk to you like that and keep it firm. You were doing what you deemed best in the moment and you made a mistake. The fact you bleached the sink told me you were attempting to correct it, but you\u2019re NTA.", "ESH (except the baby).  You could have soaked the clothes in the tub or a bucket.  Using the kitchen sink is nasty.  Your husband overreacted but he's not wrong.", "NTA. Your husband is brain dead. He should\u2019ve taken care of the mess himself.", "NTA husband is trash tho", "YTA. That's disgusting. Your rinse dishes and pots and pans in the sink, not shitty clothes .. let alone soaking them \ud83e\udd22", "Absolutely nta. Sounds like a perfectly normal thing to happen when you have a very young infant. It can be a challenging time and some poopy clothes soaking in the kitchen sink is nothing.", "NTA. Kitchen sinks aren\u2019t porous. Bleaching is 100% fine. More important to not leave the little alone. Or, you know, your husband could help.", "My dad's like your husband..that dude is alone and miserable  since he refused to respect another human - my mom- ...cant wait to dance on his grave...\n\nYour husband sounds impotent and incompetent and this is not the kind of dad or example of a man your kid needs in life..tell him that and that you also want space so he should go to his mommy's house and give him time to relish on how he's going to be as a husband and father going forward and then decide if you'll let him back home...", "Yea that\u2019s awful", "Exactly what your tub is for, to sit your ass in and clean off.
