Hopefully someone here can give me a clue. Here's the relevant info, as far as I know.\n\nMy brother and his wife are expecting their first girl after two boys. I love Ricky and Jace, and so does my SIL, but she has always wanted a girl and is very excited to be having one. She also wants to name the girl Chloe, as she loves that name. My brother hates the name Chloe and really wants to name their daughter Stephanie. They have been arguing about it for a few weeks, since finding out the gender.\n\nI got to my parents house late last night and my SIL was the only person still awake. We talked for a little bit, and she asked me the weirdest question. She asked me if I knew any stories about great aunt Stephanie. I was so confused. I literally said \"who?\"\n\nSIL clarified that she was talking about our grandmother's older sister that died when grandma was a little girl. Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.\n\nThis morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell. Ricky kept saying \"stop being grumpy on Christmas.\" So it wasn't just my imagination. I got my brother alone and confronted him. He snapped at me for \"meddling\" and told me to stay out of his marriage.\n\nMy brother is pissed at me, and my SIL won't even talk to me. I'm afraid to say anything to my parents and drag them into this, especially since I still don't know what this is. Either my grandmother had a secret sister that I don't know about but my brother does for some reason, or my brother lied to his wife to convince her to name their baby Stephanie. Both options seem equally weird to me. Maybe there's a third possibility I'm not seeing?\n\nReddit, am I the asshole? If so, please explain to me why.

It's very weird that your SIL is not talking to you. It does sound like your brother was lying to try and get his preferred name, but you only answered a direct question that was asked of you. \n\nDoes your brother generally treat your SIL well or does he seem to be the type that could be abusive? That would be a possible reason I see for SIL to stop talking to you over this.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d just ask your parents if there was an aunt Stephanie you weren\u2019t aware of. Don\u2019t say why, just ask.", "NTA - your brother lied to his wife to manipulate her to name the daughter after this grandma's sister. He's pissed he was caught.

Why is your bro so fixated on this name? And why would your SIL now not be talking to you, you\u2019re the innocent party in this. Christmas eh? Head down, count the hours and then run!", "Are you the asshole for not magically mindreading the lie your brother told his wife and for not thus immediately spinning an elaborate yarn when your SIL unexpectedly asked you about the subject of said lie?

You just spoke facts. You didn't bring it up. You weren't meddling in their marriage, how were you to know that had anything to do with their marriage? Not your fault your brother lied to his wife and got found out. I get why the brother is mad (at being found out not at you) but no idea why your SIL is mad. Don't sweat it. You didn't ruin Christmas. If anything you should be mad at them for dragging you into their drama and spoiling yours", "NTA.  \n\nTbh id confront your brother and ask him what the hell his problem is.  If his problem is you saying there\u2019s no aunt Stephanie, then say \u201cdon\u2019t get mad at me because you chose to lie and wasn\u2019t smart enough to one figure out that\u2019s a bad idea, and two understand if you\u2019re going to lie make sure it\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t fall apart the first time your wife speaks to your family\u201d\n\nAnd as for your SIL, I\u2019d ask her what her problem is too.  She\u2019s treating you like you\u2019ve done something wrong, when you haven\u2019t.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tolerate being treated like that tbh.", "NTA. It seems your brother lied and got caught. You weren\u2019t even aware this was happening. If there really was a secret sister, wouldn\u2019t he be upset with you AND set you straight by telling you how he knows about her?

I do wonder why your SIL won't talk to you, though. Did your brother tell her you were lying or something? It is very odd. \n\nI would ask your parents, in bro and SIL's hearing, about your grandmother's sisters and what were their names.", "I would tell your parents", "NTA, but your brother is for lying to his wife to prevent her from naming their daughter Chloe. You did nothing wrong. No, your grandmother did not have a secret sister who died (even if she did, why would your brother be the ONLY one who knows?). Christmas is ruined because of your brother alone and no one else. My husband and I argued over our baby girl's name and ended up putting the two together....mine first, his as the middle name because his was harder for me to pronounce. What did our daughter end up favoring? The middle name. They should keep tossing other names back and forth together to see what sticks. Sorry your Christmas is ruined, but the blame rests squarely on your brother's head.", "NTA - where are you from?

It just doesn't make sense.", "SIL may not want to antagonize brother.", "My brother adores his wife. They are always joking around and doing fun things together either as a couple or with the kids.

It's obvious now that I think about it.", "I don't think so. He didn't have a girlfriend in highschool and had one major one in college I know of. Her name was Brenda. I know he dated casually after college, but his wife was his only other serious relationship besides Brenda.", "My brother thinks Stephanie is the perfect name and hates any suggestion that isn't that.

Why does he get to decide all the kids names?", "So he doesn\u2019t create a problem in the brother\u2019s marriage.", "That's what's so confusing.

Not unless she was also a secret.", "I see what you're saying, but at the same time, my mum had a sister that passed as a baby. I bet if you surveyed my cousin's less than half would know that, if it had never come up. I can see how \"oh I had a baby sister called Stephanie who died\" could come up in conversation with 1 person without everyone knowing about it.\n\nThat said, the pissy attitude the brother has about it lends more credibility to your conclusion.", "I already asked my parents after another comment suggested it. They said there's no Stephanie. So I guess my brother lied. I just can't figure out why. It is completely out of character for him. And it's not like he's always been passionate about naming a daughter Stephanie. Before they found out the gender he never even mentioned a girl name, but he already had a boy name he loved. Then they found out the gender and he was immediately gung-ho for Stephanie.", "But I don't understand why. It's not like he's a huge Fleetwood Mac fan. Why would he be so passionate about something like this? I'm his sister; I feel like if there was someone in his life this important to him, I would know about her. Maybe I'm deluding myself.", "Well, to be fair, his wife also liked the name Richard. So that was sort of a mutual pick even though he suggested it. But she counts it as his pick and he says they decided mutually. For their second son he really, really wanted to name him Jason, and she thought it was a fine name, so she just went with it. But she's way more passionate about Chloe than she was about any of the boy names she suggested when pregnant with Jace.", "No one in their right mind could claim that OP created any sort of problem by telling the truth.  If there is a problem, it was created by the brother.  Unless you are the brother?

He might like the nickname Stevie for it or something. Once you know you can help him come up with other names he might like.

I\u2019m just trying advice that creates the least drama.", "Yes, but you need to have your siblings back. Op didn\u2019t have to lie, just say nothing. Don\u2019t go out of your way to call out your brothers lie", "Sorry, she", "Yeah, you're right. I just have to get him to fess up that he lied first.", "First of all, no, you do not *need* to have your siblings back. \n\nSecondly, OP didn't go out of their way to call out their brothers lie. They were directly asked a question with zero context.", "> you need to have your siblings back. \n\nNo.", "No worries. I just realized I don't specify in the post. Thank you.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, it was a weird position to be in, but if your brother is a bs artist his wife surely knows this. I think she set a little trap for you to get the truth. I aways try and stay out of any arguments in my siblings marriages, but sometimes that is impossible"]}
