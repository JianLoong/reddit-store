I literally said \"who?\"\n\nSIL clarified that she was talking about our grandmother's older sister that died when grandma was a little girl. Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.\n\nThis morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell. Ricky kept saying \"stop being grumpy on Christmas.\" So it wasn't just my imagination. I got my brother alone and confronted him.

I'm afraid to say anything to my parents and drag them into this, especially since I still don't know what this is. Either my grandmother had a secret sister that I don't know about but my brother does for some reason, or my brother lied to his wife to convince her to name their baby Stephanie.

Everyone now knows what my brother was doing with the kids names(except the kids obviously). They are pissed. Weirdly my mom is the most pissed. A Christmas truce is in place for the kids, so no fighting on the holiday. However the baby is definitely going to be named Chloe.

In that case, perhaps OP is the Batman/Robin fan?", "only insecure people think this way lol", "I\u2019m so confused. Did I miss something? What is this prank?? I don\u2019t see anything about a prank or what the names are supposed to mean. Was something deleted?", "only thing SIL did wrong (before refusing to talk to OP) was refusing to give up on the name Chloe (but bro should equally have given up on Stephanie). if both parents hate the other's first choice name, isn't it just obvious that they will have to compromise and go for a second choice?\n\nI'm astounded that they've been fighting for weeks and neither bro nor SIL had the maturity to suggest they look for a third name they both liked.", "I think it's less about the quality of the names, and more about the dishonesty in the selection.  The husband wasn't discussing the baby names in good faith with his wife and tried to pretend there wasn't an ulterior motive in his picks (let alone the straight up lying about \"aunt Stephanie\").", "Fred and George are perfectly fine names, but twin boys have a right to not be forever linked to now famous TERF JK Rowling just because they were unfortunate enough to be born to some Potter fan with no consideration for their children's desire to have an independent identity.", "Oh my GOD", "I would really love to know if that suggestion is accurate.", "I\u2019m sorry but this is hilarious.

The extent to which he tried to make it happen show a lot about how he sees their relationship.

I told my whole family and we laughed really hard about it. \n\n2 years later, he reconnected with his high school girlfriend Annie, who I had never been told of.

He deserves it, he was lying to her for YEARS. He is everything she says he was. He\u2019s an adolescent because he thought lying to his wife was \u201cfunny\u201d & \u201ccute\u201d when it\u2019s manipulative. He could\u2019ve asked her to just do it, like an adult, but he didn\u2019t. He wanted to ask for forgiveness & not permission, like a child. Ofc she\u2019s upset, she\u2019s upset because her own child did something like this.\n\nWhy do you think lying & manipulating, including faking a dead great aunt to guilt your wife to pick his name, is totally fine??
