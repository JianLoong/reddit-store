I literally said \"who?\"\n\nSIL clarified that she was talking about our grandmother's older sister that died when grandma was a little girl. Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.\n\nThis morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell. Ricky kept saying \"stop being grumpy on Christmas.\" So it wasn't just my imagination. I got my brother alone and confronted him.

I'm afraid to say anything to my parents and drag them into this, especially since I still don't know what this is. Either my grandmother had a secret sister that I don't know about but my brother does for some reason, or my brother lied to his wife to convince her to name their baby Stephanie.

Everyone now knows what my brother was doing with the kids names(except the kids obviously). They are pissed. Weirdly my mom is the most pissed. A Christmas truce is in place for the kids, so no fighting on the holiday. However the baby is definitely going to be named Chloe.

That doesn\u2019t help SIL.\n\n3) Father: \u201cdon\u2019t fight because it\u2019s Christmas\u201d just keeps everything on a simmer waiting to boil over.  As a kid who grew up with multiple Christmases when the parents were being fake nice, we all knew the argument was still there.\n\nI really don\u2019t see that you or SIL have gone anything wrong here.  She was lied to; you got dragged into it.  Maybe you could have avoided bringing mom and dad into it once you suspected it was likely Batman themed and had nothing to do with real or imagined family.\n\nBut I really hate the \u201cpretend the fight isn\u2019t happening because it isn\u2019t convenient due to _______\u201d Nonsense.  Bro and SIL should resolve this on their own without mandates from your parents.", "Haha\u2026  so glad he got caught!", "This sounds so stressful and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this but also thank you for the gift of this update. Just a mind blowing journey.", "Jesus fuck, I thought this was a funny coincidence, but you're serious. This man really named all of his children after former Robins \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "/u/JustBeingHonest4 didn't you mention he spends a lot of time at comic conventions ... maybe chase this theory down a little further.", "And then he's Batman! Is his name Bruce?", "Is he going in order lol", "So, the surefire way to end all hostilities and get everyone onto the same page is to suggest the name \"Martha.\"", "Omg you have to find the comments where it turns out the brother had been secretly naming all the kids off Batman and Robin characters", "Nah, he pretty much got to name the first 2 kids, and *not once* did he do any of the heavy work of producing the baby. No, weight gain, stretch marks, puking,  sore boots, need for new, stretchy clothes, and of course let's not forget the pain of 10 or *Higher* on the pain scale, when in labor and all the \"lovely\" after-effects the occure after birth!! If he even did that once, then yeah,never gets to pick the name, until then *She* (SIL) gets the final say on the name.", "...Well, at least those are all normal names?", "So Stephanie was the cover pic on the Comic Batman Eternal#24. Sept,20,2014. She 1st appeared as Robin in volume(2) #126, May 2004. She was also Batgirl ( volume 3)#1 August 2009.", "If she loved Batman as much as he did and loved the theme then awesome. Cool thing to do. But... Yeah, this is some next level Alfred-Would-Not-Approve shite.", "At that point you've gone so far so just go with Batman straight up.", "Yes \ud83d\ude2b", "SERIOUSLY?!", "Or he could be Batman.", "The dead secret sister.  Much easier to keep it a secret since she can\u2019t snitch.", "Now this is the content I come to AITA for.", "I just recently found out my dad had a half-brother. Turns out my grandfather had another son he never knew about. They both passed away in the 80s. Thank you Ancestry DNA! My dad wishes he could have met his half-brother. I've met my dad's half-nephew. He's a wicked nice guy.", "And he would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling redditors \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0c", "The only defense I can come up with these is they are not obvious unless you hear all of them together. It doesn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb like Hermione or Khaleesi would. It\u2019s ok to have names inspired by something you like, but maybe pick ones that aren\u2019t obvious.", "I mean\u2026 \ud83d\ude1c", "I guess that's why she didn't move around a lot", "Well, he was being a Crappy Crappy Doo. \ud83d\udc40", "Unfortunately it was a small village in rural India sometime in the 1930s or early 40s, so there are no records.", "I am.duong at this thread and reading it out loud to my husband..before I got to this comment he was like \"was Tim his boy's name?\"", "I saw where OP talked about the brother going to comic conventions and then it hit me where those names had to come from.", "Dude could have suggested Cassandra as a compromise and maybe they wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation", "What\u2019re the chances someone is sneakily naming his kids after Robins AND OP didn\u2019t change the names for the story?", "Am I the only one taken aback by the Carrie Kelly erasure?"]}
