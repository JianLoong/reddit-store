Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.\n\nThis morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell.
