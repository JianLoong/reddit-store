As it gets closer, ive been getting more excited. I plan to spend the day at a place that is a special interest of mine. The one thing i am worried about is my stepdad going. He has always made me uncomfortable since my high school friends pointed out the things he has said or done were definitely not appropriate. Just last week my mom told him I am learning to set boundaries and he told me \"I'll show you some boundaries.\" I had to leave my mom's cake cutting immediately after and could not sleep at all. I have constant nightmares about him and always have massive panic attacks when I have to spend longer than 10 minutes around him. Im turning 20 and I want to spend it with my mom and sibling while enjoying the day ive been trying to plan. Turning 20 is a pretty big deal for us and I am my mom's oldest kid so she wants to make it a huge deal. I dont want the reason I can't let my own mom hug me to ruin my birthday. This part is important but my mom always takes his side for a lot and I dont want her to be upset if I tell her I dont want him there. I told my sibling about it and they said they understand where I'm coming from, they also dont like him, they just dont want me to start a huge fight.

The reason i could be the asshole would me simply being rude, leaving him out of my birthday. I could be making this a bigger deal than it is. hes been in my life since i was 5 so it would be rude to leave him out of a major celebration.

I'm sure someone on the vast internet can think of a personal exception, but I've personally never heard the words \"I'll show you -insert something you mentioned-\" in any context other than as a threat, or with a sexual connotation. Both of which are inappropriate here. There's almost certainly some sort of control issue here, at the very least.\n\nAs far as suggestions... if you want to assert all of this, but don't want to do so before your big day, that's also your right.

Is there any way to celebrate the birthday without him getting involved?
