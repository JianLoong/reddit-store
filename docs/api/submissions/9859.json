Please think hard at what is possible.\n\nEven a few days a week is enough to help a child feel a sense of peace.", "NTA.  You and your mother did not choose to have this kid.  Mara did.  Mara needs to make a choice.  Either step up as a parent or gives the child up for adoption which is the best thing she could do for this child.  You are just starting out in life.  You don't need this right now.", "NTA, but nor is Mara. The child's mother and grandmother are TA. Especially granny. She left Mara to raise him from 16 and now wants to dump him on you, at 19. Why can't she take her grandson?", "Given the low chance of his mother ever being able to care for him since he is only 4 he might be better off being put up for adoption.", "Poor kid. He was raised by another child, no wonder he\u2019s a bit unruly. \n\nNo easy fix for this one", "Agreed, how uncaring are OP, OP\u2019s mother, and the grandparents? It\u2019s understandable that they don\u2019t want to take on a four year old - but they have much greater wherewithal and access to resources than a 19 year old with a baby who is in and out of shelters! As others are saying, there are potential options for government funding and going after child support, liaising with CPS and so forth, that are much easier to handle for grown adults who are not trying to take care of a baby while working factory jobs. She\u2019s doing her best to stay alive and find a safe place for these children and being turned away by multiple family members or treated like she should be paying child support for her brother? Ridiculous.", "Sounds like her claim is accurate. Addicts often start by self medicating.", "True, but unfortunately unless the parents are willing to sign off, it's nearly impossible. There are folks who really think that signing over thier rights is way worse than being a neglectful parent. It's part of the reason that so many children are in long term foster placements.", "Its not Mara's kid to deal with either honestly and OP's judgement of Mara isn't great.", "Kids at that age are still going thru the end of the terrible 2s, 3s, etc.  All kids are different of course, but some attention and guidance from someone who has time to spend with the kid and shows some affection can make a huge difference.", "oh lord... That whole family needs therapy and CPS involved.", "I was wondering the same.", "4 was the worst for my son. At 2 he would get into trouble but around 4 is when they start to be able to want things and think they can argue you to get a yes.", "To be fair, Mara\u2019s probably been in rough shape since she had to take on her brother at 16. Knowing the mom has been in and out of rehab, Mara\u2019s probably not really been mothered either.  She\u2019s an adult now but she went her formative teen years forced into a caretaker role and without a lot of support or guidance. I can imagine that takes a toll on her judgment and mental health.\n\nBut it sucks because OP\u2019s family clearly isn\u2019t in a better place to care for the kid either.", "This poor fucking kid. Does ANYONE love him? Like anyone at all in his family? His sister loved him enough to do her best whilst still a child herself to raise him despite clearly not being raised properly herself. But now she can\u2019t cope and her extended family want to be paid to step up and help. Fucking hell. Don\u2019t take him, you won\u2019t love him like he needs. Please do tell your local social services and get them both some proper support though.", "My God the poor kid. He's 4 he's not out of control and you're judgy AF. I hope this kid finds someone that actually loves him. YTA for your attitude.", "It would be different if he was an unruly 16-17 year old. But he\u2019s FOUR!  Plenty of time to turn this around.", "NAH  poor Mara had to take parenting her brother in as a teenager. Maybe everyone can pitch in a little. Can you or your mom offer to babysit to give her a break? Does she already get any government support? I\u2019d think she should qualify as she\u2019s taking on a family member. Can grandmother offer some kind of support? Obviously it\u2019s a burden to everyone but would you want have been raised this way?", "NAH. All of the parties involved are in a terrible situation.", "YTA. Obviously he's out of control. He was being raised by a teenager and no adult in the family was willing to step up. You don't have the right to be angry at your cousin for not wanting to raise her sibling with how young she is. He should have been put into foster care as soon as no adult was willing to raise him.", "NTA but: It's really messed up that your mom thinks Mara should pay her to keep someone else's kid. Like, your whole family has just decided that the kid is Mara's responsibility. Someone needs to call social services and get this child some help.", "(I'm answering these randomly as I have class work and then I'm logging out). Our grandmother is a workaholic and feels since she hasn't raised a toddler since the 80s she's unfit.", "We love him, but I don't think it's realistic to expect us to take on a toddler with behavior issues in this economy. I do not like children, my brother does but he can only tolerate so much and I feel like my mom raised two kids on her own already so she shouldn't have to raise a toddler while unemployed. I do agree with your YTA judgement however, I come across very uncaring I guess to him and Mara.", "Mara did not choose to have this child either. It's her brother, who she has been forced to care for alone since she was 16.", "Well, he's being raised by his teenage sister who's clearly overwhelmed and who has no family support. Hardly surprising there are behavior problems.\n\nAnd that also is not on the sister. A child raising her sibling just means two children who got abandoned by everyone.", "God. Get therapy and learn empathy", "OP is 19, Mara is 20.\n\nFor me NAH. I don't think the grandparents or OP's mom are uncaring, but what if they're one misstep away from being in shelters, themselves?  It's easy to pass judgement when we aren't in that situation.  I definitely don't think OP is uncaring, she's a teenager for crying out loud.\n\nAs for Mara, I don't think she's an AH either, just someone trying to survive who's had a rough time caring for her brother since she was 16 and now has a newborn...  I do hope she can find resources to help; she should be getting child support from her daughter's father and child support from the state for her brother...", "You were much kinder in your response than I was.", "\"Negative attention is better than none\" kind of situation.", "He is very hyper active and screams at us alot and curses at people. He used to bite and has tried to spit/attack his sister (not Mara I have another cousin but she is with her dad whose stable/puts her through dance/shopping trips/etc so she's largely unaffected by this). He has said he wanted to unalive said sister which made her dad really upset. He's to the point he cannot go to daycare and we worry how school will work as he'll refuse to listen and do his own thing.", "The little boy probably should have been placed in foster care; I don't understand how a 16-year old could have been given custody of a baby.", "Your response was also very valid.", "She is not his mom. She is his sister and was a literal child when left alone to raise him. None of this is her fault and she\u2019s done what she can for 4 years now. It is not her job or responsibility to be the care taker for her siblings.", "NTA", "I think part of the problem is the age mara started raising  her brother. She was 16. Then started raising a baby. Her mother is very mentally ill and OP doesn't  say how long has been/will be in rehab. I agree that another part of the issue about cousin being unruly is due to being 4. And now she's not long had her own baby and has her job. OP doesn't mention anything about mara and cousin's dad. Or anything about Mara's baby dad either. Another part of the issue is no-one is really properly fit to care for him. I hate to say it but it's either NTA/NAH it wasn't wrong for her to ask and be upset at your answer but you are not the asshole in saying no. Its harsh to say nobody wants him but what it comes down to is that none of you are really fit to care for him.", "NTA", "NTA: Not all people, regardless of age, are able to handle caring for someone else's child on a full-time basis. If Mara's mother is out of the picture and Mara has been taking care of him since she was 16, why is Social Services not already involved with this? Mara needs professional help for both her and her brother, not just to pass him off from family member to family member.", "NTA.  \nIf you wanted to be responsible for a kid, you'd have had your own.", "Im confused of why you think you even have a fucking say? ESH", "NAH \n\nBut you have known for years that Mara was struggling trying to take care of her brother. And people can say it\u2019s her fault for having her own kid but she\u2019s a child raising a child and would definitely not be making the best decisions right now. \n\nIf there was any way for you to help I would do that. You see that she\u2019s struggling and you said that your brother likes kids, you could at least babysit him from time to time. \n\nYou\u2019re just watching your cousin drown at won\u2019t do anything to help", "The fact that none of the adults in this situation are stepping up is kinda appalling. Mara should have never been left in the position of raising a child since she was 16. And OPs could learn some empathy. Of course it\u2019s hard for Mara to save money she\u2019s been supporting a family with no support since she was 16. Heaven forbid she spends some money on herself, especially when she has been robbed of a childhood.", "Kids raising kids, I\u2019d expect it", "So he's 4.", "No, wrong. Literally nothing OP does or say makes her obliged to take care of a cousin.", "Additionally addiction itself is an illness, not a moral failing, regardless of what popular opinion may be.", "At 20 it's not op's cousin's job either, especially since she's been raising the kid, her sibling, since she was 16.", "So a kid is a done deal by age 6.  I pray this kid finds a single adult who gives a rat's ass about him between now and then.   OP... yta.  So are all your relatives.", "All his life. 16 year old sister started to raise him. She was effectively mom. OP says aunt is very mentally ill and is in rehab. So now sister has her own baby at quite a young age and the 4 year old and is suffering from burnout", "Blame is irrelevant to my point.", "I\u2019m not blaming him at all.", "With bad social skills. That\u2019s not good. Age 4 is the point of no return with being normally socialized.", "Not a done deal... but if they don't find stability and a lot of patience, acceptance, and love, the odds are good for a human who will struggle very, very hard for life.", "This is the philosophy that my foster kids (ages 2 & 4) live by. To the point that one will watch the other do something, be scolded for it, and immediately do the same thing just to get my undivided attention on them. They were in 5 homes in 4 months before coming to me. After 6 months with me and countless repetitions of this scenario + intense work on bonding, that behavior is finally starting to decrease.\n\nOP's cousin deserves someone who understands and can put in the very hard work required to teach him secure attachment and proper boundaries. If no one in the family will do it for him, his best chances may lie being cared for outside the family. (And I say that fully aware of how fractured and terrible the foster care system can be. But at least he'd have a chance. It doesn't sound like he has much of one now, and it breaks my heart for him.)\n\nOP is NTA. Neither is Mara. The rest of the adults here, however, are for not acting in the best interests of all these children.", "And none of the adults in your family has gotten him psychiatric help? A toddler shouldn't have the capacity to make death threats.  Horrible things have happened to this child and, while this is not your fault personally, he has been criminally neglected by the adults in your family.", "Where did he learn these behaviors?  Who is cursing around a 4 year old?  Why has no one set boundaries about biting people and spitting at them?  No daycare is going to accept him, and kindergarten will be hell for him if he does not learn boundaries.  He is being set up for failure and a miserable life. kt", "My heart breaks for this kid. He's being raised by a kid who is doing their level best.   She wants to tap out and her adult family members won't help.  This is what is wrong with humans.", "This. 100%. Toddlers don\u2019t act like this unless they\u2019ve seen it before. This child has gone through serious trauma and needs help.", "NTA\nIt shouldn't fall to you or your  mom. Poor kid. He needs stability. Good luck.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault. Are you based in the US? Do you need help figuring out how to call CPS?", "The adult(s) that allowed a BABY to be cared for by their 16 year old sibling is the AH. My heart breaks for them both.", "Nta. But i think it's weird she had to take care of him at 16? Way to young? \nI first tought it was her own son.", "I know. Why is everyone mad at Mara? She's been stepping up at a young age. Be mad at the kid's parents.", "Has child protective services already been involved in your cousin\u2019s current placement with his sister? Either way, it sounds like they need to be called again or for the first time since his parents are missing and he has no one to care for him. It sounds like he may have his own special needs that need to be addressed. He doesn\u2019t seem to be getting the care he needs from his sister (not that she wasn\u2019t trying, but she was a kid herself) if he is unruly and no one likes to be around him.", "Exactly. Why should Mara pay her family members to take care of her brother? She did not choose to have that child and she stepped up at 16. It should be the child's mother, or if the mother is incapable (which it seems she is), then other adults in the family and/or social services.", "Yikes. The whole family needs therapy.", "What adults ?", "Everyone is saying \u201cthe mother.\u201d \n\nThese children have a FATHER. Or FATHERS. Where tf are they in all of this?? These are not just the failings of the mother and the other adults. Where tf are the men and why hasn\u2019t anyone asked??", "But a 16 year old girl was fit to raised her brother for four years, basically his whole life with no support from his father, grandmother or any adult in the family. Sorry WHAT? Unless there are things you omitted it sounds like Mara was left to fend for herself and her brother all alone and no one seemed to care. Honestly they are the only two I feel bad for in this situation. Others should have stepped up a long time ago to help Mara, not just now that she has her own baby. Couldn't someone take Mara in, she wouldn't have to worry about where to sleep every night and wouldn't be the only adult taking care of her brother. That would be better for her, her daughter and her brother than no good daughter's father and shelters.Also, time to demand child support from BOTH fathers for their specific kid.", "You're right. I absolutely don't put the blame on the mother alone. But here he wasn't even mentioned so I wondered if he was even alive any more and didn't want to bring it up", "Every adult in your family fucking sucks except maybe mara. Entire family is so selfish. Because the fact he has these issues and NOBODY has gotten him therapy or any type of help is appalling. Does anyone fucking care???? \n\nJfc this kid has no hope. You all need therapy especially the little boy.", "ESH besides Mara & the 4y/o!! \n\nThe village is not what it used to be! & this is pitiful for family to treat each other like this.", "Yea what an awful situation for everyone involved, you're NTA, don't wanna say she is either and idk enough to call anyone an AH but poor kid tho", "NTA but Seriously how bad can a 4 year old be, I've looked after a room full of them. It's sad no one wants this kid because he probably just needs the right kinda environment, love and guidance.", "And then she had another one. So sad for both children."]}
