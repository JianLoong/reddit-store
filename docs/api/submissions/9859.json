Please think hard at what is possible.\n\nEven a few days a week is enough to help a child feel a sense of peace.", "NTA.  You and your mother did not choose to have this kid.  Mara did.  Mara needs to make a choice.  Either step up as a parent or gives the child up for adoption which is the best thing she could do for this child.  You are just starting out in life.  You don't need this right now.", "NTA, but nor is Mara. The child's mother and grandmother are TA. Especially granny. She left Mara to raise him from 16 and now wants to dump him on you, at 19. Why can't she take her grandson?", "Given the low chance of his mother ever being able to care for him since he is only 4 he might be better off being put up for adoption.", "Poor kid. He was raised by another child, no wonder he\u2019s a bit unruly. \n\nNo easy fix for this one", "Agreed, how uncaring are OP, OP\u2019s mother, and the grandparents? It\u2019s understandable that they don\u2019t want to take on a four year old - but they have much greater wherewithal and access to resources than a 19 year old with a baby who is in and out of shelters! As others are saying, there are potential options for government funding and going after child support, liaising with CPS and so forth, that are much easier to handle for grown adults who are not trying to take care of a baby while working factory jobs. She\u2019s doing her best to stay alive and find a safe place for these children and being turned away by multiple family members or treated like she should be paying child support for her brother? Ridiculous.", "Sounds like her claim is accurate. Addicts often start by self medicating.", "True, but unfortunately unless the parents are willing to sign off, it's nearly impossible. There are folks who really think that signing over thier rights is way worse than being a neglectful parent. It's part of the reason that so many children are in long term foster placements.", "Its not Mara's kid to deal with either honestly and OP's judgement of Mara isn't great.", "Kids at that age are still going thru the end of the terrible 2s, 3s, etc.  All kids are different of course, but some attention and guidance from someone who has time to spend with the kid and shows some affection can make a huge difference.", "oh lord... That whole family needs therapy and CPS involved.", "I was wondering the same.", "4 was the worst for my son. At 2 he would get into trouble but around 4 is when they start to be able to want things and think they can argue you to get a yes.", "To be fair, Mara\u2019s probably been in rough shape since she had to take on her brother at 16. Knowing the mom has been in and out of rehab, Mara\u2019s probably not really been mothered either.  She\u2019s an adult now but she went her formative teen years forced into a caretaker role and without a lot of support or guidance. I can imagine that takes a toll on her judgment and mental health.\n\nBut it sucks because OP\u2019s family clearly isn\u2019t in a better place to care for the kid either.", "This poor fucking kid. Does ANYONE love him? Like anyone at all in his family? His sister loved him enough to do her best whilst still a child herself to raise him despite clearly not being raised properly herself. But now she can\u2019t cope and her extended family want to be paid to step up and help. Fucking hell. Don\u2019t take him, you won\u2019t love him like he needs. Please do tell your local social services and get them both some proper support though.", "My God the poor kid. He's 4 he's not out of control and you're judgy AF. I hope this kid finds someone that actually loves him. YTA for your attitude.", "It would be different if he was an unruly 16-17 year old. But he\u2019s FOUR!  Plenty of time to turn this around.", "NAH  poor Mara had to take parenting her brother in as a teenager. Maybe everyone can pitch in a little. Can you or your mom offer to babysit to give her a break? Does she already get any government support? I\u2019d think she should qualify as she\u2019s taking on a family member. Can grandmother offer some kind of support? Obviously it\u2019s a burden to everyone but would you want have been raised this way?", "NAH. All of the parties involved are in a terrible situation.", "YTA. Obviously he's out of control. He was being raised by a teenager and no adult in the family was willing to step up. You don't have the right to be angry at your cousin for not wanting to raise her sibling with how young she is. He should have been put into foster care as soon as no adult was willing to raise him.", "NTA but: It's really messed up that your mom thinks Mara should pay her to keep someone else's kid. Like, your whole family has just decided that the kid is Mara's responsibility. Someone needs to call social services and get this child some help.", "(I'm answering these randomly as I have class work and then I'm logging out). Our grandmother is a workaholic and feels since she hasn't raised a toddler since the 80s she's unfit.", "We love him, but I don't think it's realistic to expect us to take on a toddler with behavior issues in this economy. I do not like children, my brother does but he can only tolerate so much and I feel like my mom raised two kids on her own already so she shouldn't have to raise a toddler while unemployed. I do agree with your YTA judgement however, I come across very uncaring I guess to him and Mara.", "Mara did not choose to have this child either. It's her brother, who she has been forced to care for alone since she was 16.", "Well, he's being raised by his teenage sister who's clearly overwhelmed and who has no family support. Hardly surprising there are behavior problems.\n\nAnd that also is not on the sister. A child raising her sibling just means two children who got abandoned by everyone.", "God. Get therapy and learn empathy", "OP is 19, Mara is 20.\n\nFor me NAH. I don't think the grandparents or OP's mom are uncaring, but what if they're one misstep away from being in shelters, themselves?  It's easy to pass judgement when we aren't in that situation.  I definitely don't think OP is uncaring, she's a teenager for crying out loud.\n\nAs for Mara, I don't think she's an AH either, just someone trying to survive who's had a rough time caring for her brother since she was 16 and now has a newborn...  I do hope she can find resources to help; she should be getting child support from her daughter's father and child support from the state for her brother...", "You were much kinder in your response than I was.", "\"Negative attention is better than none\" kind of situation.", "He is very hyper active and screams at us alot and curses at people. He used to bite and has tried to spit/attack his sister (not Mara I have another cousin but she is with her dad whose stable/puts her through dance/shopping trips/etc so she's largely unaffected by this). He has said he wanted to unalive said sister which made her dad really upset. He's to the point he cannot go to daycare and we worry how school will work as he'll refuse to listen and do his own thing.", "The little boy probably should have been placed in foster care; I don't understand how a 16-year old could have been given custody of a baby.", "Your response was also very valid.", "She is not his mom. She is his sister and was a literal child when left alone to raise him. None of this is her fault and she\u2019s done what she can for 4 years now. It is not her job or responsibility to be the care taker for her siblings."]}
