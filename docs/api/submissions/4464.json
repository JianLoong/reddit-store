Under the bed isn't a good hiding spot though.  Put the book in a pillow case, drap this across a hanger and secure it with clothespins.  Put a coat or heavy thick clothing on the hanger to cover the book.  It should be safe there until your sister is over this phase of the breakup.", "NTA. That book is yours. Not Oliver's. Keep it on you at all times until this blows over.", "I would want to keep something like that too. But she doesn\u2019t care that much about the book, she\u2019s more than happy to give it back so long as HE no longer wants her to have it.  He just has to call and talk to her directly since he\u2019s ignoring her calls and texts.  I\u2019m sorry but that combined with the smart and handsome comment (completely irrelevant to the narrative) just gives off a really creepy I wanna do your BF vibe\n\nETA Judgment: YTA", "NTA. It was a gift and it belongs to you, your sister has no rights to it.", "Nta. Even in the scenario that he did want it back, it was a gift and it\u2019s yours now. But I second everyone telling you to find a better hiding place.", "Ummm, kind of? It's an ESH for me - your sister and her ex of almost 2 years just broke up and I'm sure it's really hard on her. She shouldn't be trying to get your gift back but honestly, you shouldn't be reaching out to him. I don't know your relationship to your sister, but neither of you sound too sympathetic to one another right now.", "You can keep the book if you want but I wouldn't message him anymore if I were you. He doesn't want to hear from you or your sister. It sounds like you have a crush on him, which is fine, as long as you don't act on it. Your sister is wrong to demand that you send the book back.", "YTA.  Normally I\u2019d agree with the other people saying N T A because it was a gift to you, but it\u2019s super weird to me that you care more about Oliver\u2019s feelings than your sister\u2019s since you\u2019re willing to give him the book back.  How long do you plan to wait before you try to get him in bed", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis was a gift to you. It belongs to you. Your sister has no right to ask you about this book. You better hide it really good.", "NTA", "NTA, find a better hiding spot, under the bed will be among the first places she would look.

Your sister will find it and throw it away at some point...even after time passes I bet she would chuck it still.... That book needs to stay hidden. That was a gift given to you. Neither one is entitled to ask for it back.", "NTA. It was a cool gift and it\u2019s yours. Obviously your sister is very angry at him but she\u2019s overstepping.

Ya weirdo.", "\ud83d\ude02 Did you hurt yourself reaching that hard? Some of us just really like books!!!! \n\nIf someone gave me a really cool translation of a book I loved or a first edition, signed copy, etc, me not giving it back when it was a gift does not imply I want to sleep with them. \n\nIt just implies I like the book.", "NTA for keeping the book but stop calling and texting your sisters ex. By doing that you are inserting yourself in their breakup, and by him not replying it's pretty clear that it's not only your sister who wants this to stop. \n\nI can't say for sure whether he really asked your sister to get the book back for him, but your certainty that he wouldn't, calling him handsome, being 'flattered' by him getting you the present and the continued attempts to contact him kind of make it sound like you have a crush on him which is could be what your sisters really mad about.", "I think you want to talk to Oliver not just to confirm that he wants the book back but because you have feelings for him. You want to talk to him again because you still want to see him. But he's your sister's ex. He was just being nice to you because you're her sister. So you can keep the book but don't contact him anymore. If he wanted to talk to you he wouldn't ignore you. Your sister shouldn't be trying to make you return the book.

We don't know his side of the story at all.", "I actually think he has a crush on her.... why else would her sister be demanding a gift to OP be returned? That's not a normal break up thing. I've definitely returned items I still had that belonged to them or some gifts I just didn't want to have anymore that connected with a bad break up. But I've never gone to family and asked them to return gifts they received.\n\nJudgement call for OP: NTA but definitely find a safe place for the book and steer clear of the ex. Nothing good will come of this.", "I think you're right. And I think that if he does contact her, OP plans to talk about a lot more than just the book.", "This!", "Its not weird, Oliver got her the book. Its incredibly rude if he is asking for a gift back but I'd definitely feel different if the gift giver wanted something back vs someone being mad at the gift giver and not wanting me to have it", "If sister is telling the truth, and Oliver did request that his gift to OP be returned, then his behavior is immature.", "My thought too, especially given the specifics of the book.", "I suck at Redditing and added a new comment with the text below instead of replying to you\n\nI would want to keep something like that too.

The direct contact between OP and the sister\u2019s ex-bf?\n\nIdk. Either this family is super close, or there was something going on - maybe just a one-sided crush on OP OR the ex-bf\u2019s side - with OP and ex-bf.

And OP thinks he's smart and handsome.\n\nAgain, maybe it's just a big jump.", "NTA It was a gift, it belongs to you, besides that you are 18, so no one can legally take it off you.  You are not inserting yourself into the break up.

Also you can stop texting/calling him. He doesn\u2019t want the book back. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want much of anything to do with you/your family. That\u2019s not your fault, not even necessarily your sister\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just how it sometimes is after breakups. \nIt\u2019s not your job but maybe say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you and Oliver broke up and I know you must just want all reminders of him gone, but this book was a gift and is really important to me for reasons unrelated to Oliver.

Document your ownership and let sister know that you will report theft if she gets any ideas. And lock your room.", "Well now we know why they broke up. NTA but hide that book if you really want to keep it.", "NTA. Like you said it was a gift from Oliver to you, therefore your sister has no right to tell you what to do with it. She\u2019s probably just in the midst of grieving her long-term relationship and not thinking straight.\n\nETA because I have some thoughts on your sister\u2019s thought process: I can see how she might think you and Oliver had something go on. You described him as handsome, and of all the books he could\u2019ve given you he gave you one about a forbidden teenage love.

He chose an old (romantic/beautiful and \"unique\" (ie not mass produced)), French (romantic, probably not insanely common), version of a book about forbidden teenaged love.\n\nSure, it could be a wacky coincidence.\n\nBut I personally doubt it.", "Personally a French translation of an English play seems like an odd choice but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Though i vote NTA.

You should hide the book in an even more secure place, like your locker at school perhaps, since she is the one trying to involve you in her breakup by trying to harm her ex by stealing from you. Yes your feelings toward her ex are inappropriate, and your continued attempts to contact him or inappropriate, but that does not give your sister the right to steal from you", "NTA \n\nIt seems like more is going on here but not the AH for not returning a gift. Just because of how angry your sister is acting and the book it was (very famous forbidden love tale) maybe she\u2019s convinced herself that her ex had a crush on her kid sister.
