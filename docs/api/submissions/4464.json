I don't know what happened between them that made them end things so suddenly. I have always really liked Oliver. He is smart and handsome. We have some things in common, mainly that we both like reading and talking about books. For my last birthday he gave me an old french edition of Romeo and Juliet. I really like it and I felt really flattered that he even think of giving me something for my birthday.\n\nYesterday, my sister told me that she is picking up all of Oliver's stuff to give them back to him and I had to return the book. I was very surprised by this. That book was a gift from him to me, it has nothing to do with my sister or their relationship. I asked her if Oliver had asked for the book back and she said yes but I have a strong feeling she is not telling the truth.\n\nI said that I will only return the book if he directly calls me and tells me to. I have tried calling him myself but he isn't answering and he is leaving the messages I send on read. My sister is really mad at me for all this, saying that I am making things harder for her and inserting myself in her break up. I hid the book under my bed because I am afraid she will take it herself when I am not around.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670762998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ziqn76/aita_for_not_wanting_to_return_a_book_my_sisters/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is behaving inappropriately. He gave the book to YOU. She's undoubtedly dismayed about the end of the relationship but that doesn't give her rights to things he gave to you.

It was a gift, not a loan.  It's not appropriate for your sister or Oliver to ask for it back.  Keep the book, it's yours.  You seem more reasonable and mature than either your sister or Oliver.", "NTA... Find a better hiding place for it, though...", "NTA\n\nGift is a gift and the book belongs to you now, not him. I understand your sister might be mad but she is unreasonable in this case.", "NTA. Was a birthay present for you, its nothing to be with they brockup. Keepit and I think you must hiden from your sister aswell.", "NTA\n\nYou haven\u2019t inserted yourself in her break up. She\u2019s doing that by herself. Keep the book. It\u2019s yours.

She doesn't get to decide what is done with it.\n\nI'd hide it or buy a lock box for it, one big enough and heavy enough she can't just take the whole thing.", "NTA. It was a gift for you. Your sister has no business with this book. But find a better hiding place.", "NTA.", "NTA. I understand your sister is hurting from the breakup, but that is not her property. It was a gift to you, you love it, and do not need to return - not because she wants you to and not even if Oliver asks for it back. Definitely keep it hidden.", "NTA but idk why he wouldn\u2019t just say you can keep the book or I want it back. Like why would he just ignore you lol. Weird but yeah it\u2019s a gift, keep it. Hide it better than under your bed", "NTA Juliet, but you may want to secure that book a bit better or sister will surely abscond with it.", "NTA. But I can't help but wonder if Oliver had feelings for you?

Under the bed isn't a good hiding spot though.  Put the book in a pillow case, drap this across a hanger and secure it with clothespins.  Put a coat or heavy thick clothing on the hanger to cover the book.  It should be safe there until your sister is over this phase of the breakup.", "NTA. That book is yours. Not Oliver's. Keep it on you at all times until this blows over."]}
