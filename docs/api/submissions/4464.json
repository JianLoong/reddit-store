I don't know what happened between them that made them end things so suddenly. I have always really liked Oliver. He is smart and handsome. We have some things in common, mainly that we both like reading and talking about books. For my last birthday he gave me an old french edition of Romeo and Juliet. I really like it and I felt really flattered that he even think of giving me something for my birthday.\n\nYesterday, my sister told me that she is picking up all of Oliver's stuff to give them back to him and I had to return the book. I was very surprised by this. That book was a gift from him to me, it has nothing to do with my sister or their relationship. I asked her if Oliver had asked for the book back and she said yes but I have a strong feeling she is not telling the truth.\n\nI said that I will only return the book if he directly calls me and tells me to. I have tried calling him myself but he isn't answering and he is leaving the messages I send on read. My sister is really mad at me for all this, saying that I am making things harder for her and inserting myself in her break up. I hid the book under my bed because I am afraid she will take it herself when I am not around.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1670762998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ziqn76/aita_for_not_wanting_to_return_a_book_my_sisters/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is behaving inappropriately. He gave the book to YOU. She's undoubtedly dismayed about the end of the relationship but that doesn't give her rights to things he gave to you.

It was a gift, not a loan.  It's not appropriate for your sister or Oliver to ask for it back.  Keep the book, it's yours.  You seem more reasonable and mature than either your sister or Oliver.", "NTA... Find a better hiding place for it, though...", "NTA\n\nGift is a gift and the book belongs to you now, not him. I understand your sister might be mad but she is unreasonable in this case.", "NTA. Was a birthay present for you, its nothing to be with they brockup. Keepit and I think you must hiden from your sister aswell.", "NTA\n\nYou haven\u2019t inserted yourself in her break up. She\u2019s doing that by herself. Keep the book. It\u2019s yours. It was a birthday gift to you. Nothing to do with your sister.", "NTA. That book was a gift and is your personal property; you get to decide what to do with it.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis was a gift to you, and has nothing to do with her breakup. Ignore her.", "NTA the book was a gift fuck that", "NTA .. she needs to grow up", "NTA once he gave you that book it became yours not his, or your sisters.  Keep it and enjoy it!

Your sister has no business with this book. But find a better hiding place.", "NTA.", "NTA. I understand your sister is hurting from the breakup, but that is not her property.

Definitely keep it hidden.", "NTA but idk why he wouldn\u2019t just say you can keep the book or I want it back. Like why would he just ignore you lol. Weird but yeah it\u2019s a gift, keep it.

Under the bed isn't a good hiding spot though.  Put the book in a pillow case, drap this across a hanger and secure it with clothespins.  Put a coat or heavy thick clothing on the hanger to cover the book.  It should be safe there until your sister is over this phase of the breakup.", "NTA. That book is yours. Not Oliver's. Keep it on you at all times until this blows over.", "I would want to keep something like that too. But she doesn\u2019t care that much about the book, she\u2019s more than happy to give it back so long as HE no longer wants her to have it.  He just has to call and talk to her directly since he\u2019s ignoring her calls and texts.  I\u2019m sorry but that combined with the smart and handsome comment (completely irrelevant to the narrative) just gives off a really creepy I wanna do your BF vibe\n\nETA Judgment: YTA", "NTA. It was a gift and it belongs to you, your sister has no rights to it.", "Nta. Even in the scenario that he did want it back, it was a gift and it\u2019s yours now. But I second everyone telling you to find a better hiding place.", "Ummm, kind of? It's an ESH for me - your sister and her ex of almost 2 years just broke up and I'm sure it's really hard on her. She shouldn't be trying to get your gift back but honestly, you shouldn't be reaching out to him. I don't know your relationship to your sister, but neither of you sound too sympathetic to one another right now.", "You can keep the book if you want but I wouldn't message him anymore if I were you. He doesn't want to hear from you or your sister. It sounds like you have a crush on him, which is fine, as long as you don't act on it. Your sister is wrong to demand that you send the book back.", "YTA.  Normally I\u2019d agree with the other people saying N T A because it was a gift to you, but it\u2019s super weird to me that you care more about Oliver\u2019s feelings than your sister\u2019s since you\u2019re willing to give him the book back.  How long do you plan to wait before you try to get him in bed", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis was a gift to you. It belongs to you. Your sister has no right to ask you about this book. You better hide it really good.", "NTA", "NTA, find a better hiding spot, under the bed will be among the first places she would look. Weird he leaves you on read but whatever, it was a gift and if he really wants it back he can always reply to your texts or ask for it himself.", "NTA \n\n\nYou need to leave that book somewhere else though. Your sister will find it and throw it away at some point...even after time passes I bet she would chuck it still.... That book needs to stay hidden. That was a gift given to you. Neither one is entitled to ask for it back.", "NTA. It was a cool gift and it\u2019s yours. Obviously your sister is very angry at him but she\u2019s overstepping. If he turned into a supervillain whose gifts must be renounced she\u2019s obligated to tell you why. No context, no renunciation of the gift.", "NTA. It was a gift for you. It has Nothing to do with your sister.", "Nta. Even if he asks for it back, it is a gift. A gift to you, not your sister.", "She is being ridiculous NTA", "NTA", "I don't know why more people haven't noticed this.", "Or\u2026 or\u2026 she just wants to keep the book that was a gift to her. Ya weirdo.", "\ud83d\ude02 Did you hurt yourself reaching that hard? Some of us just really like books!!!! \n\nIf someone gave me a really cool translation of a book I loved or a first edition, signed copy, etc, me not giving it back when it was a gift does not imply I want to sleep with them. \n\nIt just implies I like the book.", "NTA for keeping the book but stop calling and texting your sisters ex. By doing that you are inserting yourself in their breakup, and by him not replying it's pretty clear that it's not only your sister who wants this to stop. \n\nI can't say for sure whether he really asked your sister to get the book back for him, but your certainty that he wouldn't, calling him handsome, being 'flattered' by him getting you the present and the continued attempts to contact him kind of make it sound like you have a crush on him which is could be what your sisters really mad about.", "I think you want to talk to Oliver not just to confirm that he wants the book back but because you have feelings for him. You want to talk to him again because you still want to see him. But he's your sister's ex. He was just being nice to you because you're her sister. So you can keep the book but don't contact him anymore. If he wanted to talk to you he wouldn't ignore you. Your sister shouldn't be trying to make you return the book. But you shouldn't try to make him talk to you.", "Hell no, NTA\n\nYou try and take my book you will withdraw a bloody stump!", "NTA. Use another book cover to wrap your book and hide it in plain sight (just with all the other book).", "NTA. That book is none of your sister\u2019s business.", "NTA. weird she even thought of it when collecting \u201chis\u201d things to return to him\u2026. might\u2019ve been jealous it was so thoughtful and given to someone other than her? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She is clowning you or he is clowning her. Gifts to you are not and never were a part of their relationship.", "NTA", "NTA. The book was a gift. Keep it. Your sister has not right to take the book.", "NTA. Find a better hiding place. Even a 6 year old would know to look there first lol", "Info: do you have a crush on him?\n\nAlso, don't contact him, it's really not appropriate imo", "NTA. Unless the book has a giant photo of the ex's face on the cover, it shouldn't bother your sister.", "How is Oliver not being mature? We don't know his side of the story at all.", "I actually think he has a crush on her.... why else would her sister be demanding a gift to OP be returned? That's not a normal break up thing. I've definitely returned items I still had that belonged to them or some gifts I just didn't want to have anymore that connected with a bad break up. But I've never gone to family and asked them to return gifts they received.\n\nJudgement call for OP: NTA but definitely find a safe place for the book and steer clear of the ex. Nothing good will come of this.", "I think you're right. And I think that if he does contact her, OP plans to talk about a lot more than just the book.", "This!", "Its not weird, Oliver got her the book. Its incredibly rude if he is asking for a gift back but I'd definitely feel different if the gift giver wanted something back vs someone being mad at the gift giver and not wanting me to have it", "If sister is telling the truth, and Oliver did request that his gift to OP be returned, then his behavior is immature.", "My thought too, especially given the specifics of the book.", "I suck at Redditing and added a new comment with the text below instead of replying to you\n\nI would want to keep something like that too. But she doesn\u2019t care that much about the book, she\u2019s more than happy to give it back so long as HE no longer wants her to have it.  He just has to call and talk to her directly since he\u2019s ignoring her calls and texts.  I\u2019m sorry but that combined with the smart and handsome comment (completely irrelevant to the narrative) just gives off a really creepy I wanna do your BF vibe", "If", "She\u2019s saying that because she doesn\u2019t want to give the book back, and thinks her sister made it up. Calling sister\u2019s bluff.", "Of course"]}
