My husband\u2019s mother passed away and his father left when he was a kid. \n\nClearly, our children don\u2019t really have grandparents. It\u2019s never really been an issue for us. Anyways, husband has a friend I\u2019m calling May. She\u2019s nice enough but I\u2019m not a huge fan of hers.\n\nShe knows our kids don\u2019t have grandparents and always mentions how sad that is. She believes every child needs to have grandparents around. The amount of times she\u2019s suggested I reconcile with my parents is ridiculous.\n\nWell she invited us to dinner the other night. When we got there, I noticed we were the only ones despite her saying more people were going to be there. I asked her about it and she told us to just hold on. \n\nWell the doorbell rang and guess who it was? My husband\u2019s father. Yup. May and my husband are childhood friends and his father never left where they\u2019re from so he wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find at all but the situation was insane. \n\nThe second my husband made eye contact with his father, he walked out. His dad followed him. I was planning on going to them but May stopped me to ask why my husband left like that. I asked her if she was being serious. She said \u201cwell yeah I mean I literally got his dad, do you know how many times he used to tell me how bad he wanted his dad-besides the point, but he should be happy. Oh and... now the kids can have a grandpa. You\u2019re welcome by the way. Grandparent love is just so special.\u201d \n\nI saw red. Idk if my anger was warranted but I just couldn\u2019t comprehend her thought process. I said \u201cI guess it\u2019s my fault for not realizing how stupid you actually are, but you don\u2019t get to make these decisions for us-for my husband especially. I hope you enjoyed today, because you\u2019re never going to see him again.\u201d I may have called her an idiot after too.\n\nShe teared up and started going on about how she only wanted to fulfill my husband\u2019s childhood dreams and give our kids a grandparent but I just gathered the kids and left. My husband was waiting in the car (his dad left) and all he said was \u201cbetter you than me\u201d when I told him. \n\nShe keeps texting me though saying that she\u2019s sorry if she offended me but she was just trying to do something kind for her friend and his kids. She said that I didn\u2019t have to insult her and that I don\u2019t get to speak for my husband. Now I\u2019m sort of starting to wonder if I am the asshole. She\u2019s insisting that she had good intentions and also insists that I\u2019m depriving the kids by restricting husband\u2019s father and should try and encourage him. She also says I went too far which maybe I did. Plus, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t necessarily get to decide who my husband remains friends with.

Recommend completely cutting May out of the picture.  If she tries it once, she might try again at a time and place where the kids are present.", "NTA\n\nShe was way out of line. Children do not NEED grandparents.", "NTA\n\nSure you don\u2019t get to decide who your husband is friends with, but having his back when someone crosses the line like this is not a bad thing.\n\nAnd blowing up (as you describe it - I don\u2019t think it was an overreaction) is totally understandable in this situation.\n\nSounds like May has her own issues to deal with, and she doesn\u2019t show any remorse about her entirely unacceptable, controlling behaviour. \n\nYou\u2019re right to stay away from her - no grandparents is far better than giving people access to your kids just because they\u2019re related. You and your husband have your reasons for not having relationships and that is all May needs to know to rein herself in.\n\nShe is totally disrespectful and just a bad, BAD, friend.\n\nI hope you guys can stay away from her", "NTA. \n\n>I guess it\u2019s my fault for not realizing how stupid you actually are, but you don\u2019t get to make these decisions for us-for my husband especially.\n\nYou nailed it there. She decides who she has in her life, not in yours.", "NTA\n\nWhat is this woman's problem? Did she watch too many feel good Disney movies and thinks that grand surprise gestures literally fix everybody's problems? If she wanted to facilitate some sort of reconciliation, assuming she was close enough to your family that that would be appropriate, she should have asked. You don't just drop something like this on someone by surprise. It's an absolute joke. No matter how much she thinks she knows somebody, she can't possibly know what the relationship between 2 other people entail. What if there had been some really bad blood there? Like what if there was some domestic violence that she just didn't know about? It wouldn't be unreasonable, most people don't like to open up about that stuff even to their friends, which is why you would ask before doing something like this.\n\nSo no, you're definitely NTA.", "NTA. The arrogance of her interference is astonishing. You simply just don't do what she did. Is she suddenly going to spring your parents on you in the future? Stay tuned.", "NTA\n\nShe has no right to make decisions like that. \n\nYour husband may have missed having a father figure before but that doesn't mean she knows how he actually feels about his father, and she clearly doesn't know what your husband needs and wants.\n\nShe had it coming. She crossed a major boundary. If anything the only thing making your kids possibly upset by not having grandparents, is her. She keeps crying about how sad it is, but your kids can grow up happy and well without grandparents.\n\nHer constantly voicing them being without grandparents is whats gonna end up making them possibly sad over not having grandparents.", "NTA. You were right on all counts, even the part about your husband not being friends with her because you are his wife, and he vowed to put you first. \nStay far away from this woman. She is not a friend.", "Nta... way over the line. \nHas she been reaching out to your husband as well? She owes him an apology. You do not owe her one. If she was a true lifelong friend, she should know better.", "NTA AT ALL!! \n\nThis May sounds like a manipulative piece of work. These apologies she\u2019s texting you are non apologies- with the \u201c*if* I offended you\u201d, \u201cdoing something for the kids\u201d and that OP didn\u2019t need to insult her.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate who your husband is friends with, but you definitely don\u2019t need to be friends with her. And your kids don\u2019t need to see her either. \n\nBlock her and get on with your lives.", "NTA.\n\nMay was so out of line to do what she did. You are a good partner to stand up for husband. She does not get to spin this on you by saying that you should not have said what you said. If that is so, then she should not meddle in people's personal affairs.\n\nWho does she think she is? Some family reconciling institution? \n\nCalling her an idiot was just not sufficient. Next time, if you ever see her again, call her a meddling gossipping nosy old aunty who has nothing better to do than poke their noses where it should not be poked from my side. This is what we call people like May be India.", "NTA-May overstepped clear boundaries that you and your husband have in place. The fact that hubby walked out first tells everyone how not ok he was with what May did. You're explosion was well warranted and May needs to be cut off since she might try it again, only with your parents or in regards to another boundary you have in place.", "NTA. You can have good intentions and still be an asshole. May sounds insufferable.", "NTA\n\nI really don't like it when people think they can just mend other people's personal relationships. Your husband's friend had no right to arrange this meeting without consulting your husband first and you are allowed to react on your husband's behalf.", "May needed to be put in her place. FIRMLY. You did this. NTA", "NTA", "NTA  Tell her that you don't want her in your or your children's lives. If her husband had wanted his father to be a grandfather to his children he would have done so himself. Not everyone has a grandparent and not everyone needs one. If and when her husband ever decides to forgive her they'll let her know. But since you can no longer trust her you don't know if that will ever happen and you definitely don't want someone like that around your children. If you let her get by with this she'll be trying to bring your parents back into your life too.", "NTA May crossed the line. She had no business meddling in what was clearly none of her business. She got what she deserves.", "NTA\n\n\"\\[...\\] do you know how many times he used to tell me how bad he wanted his dad \\[...\\]\"  \nEmphasis on USED TO - wonder how many years it's been since he saw the light and realized a parent who leaves a kid is not actually someone you necessarily want in your life  \n\"\\[...\\] she only wanted to fulfill my husband\u2019s childhood dreams \\[...\\]\" - does she not see that he's an adult now? That the way he felt when he first left is no longer accurate now? That he himself gets to decide who is in his life and who isn't?\n\nYou obviously tried to keep it calm and easy and pleasant all of the previous times she insisted grandparents are necessities, but after all that, she threw all that in your face by inviting him, so clearly harsh language was the only thing to do and even so she's still convinced it was the right thing\n\nIf your husband choses to end the friendship over this - which honestly would be only too understandable because who does this??? - it won't have anything to do with the way you handled his so-called friend, but because she not only crossed a line, she crossed an entire barcode worth of lines, stomped on it and set it on fire with him on top.\n\nI can't imagine the world of hurt he is in, not only having come face to face with the parent who didn't want him, but realizing his friend can't see past her own opinion of what is right to the point where she did this to him (and you)\n\nNo one but your husband gets to decide whether he wants his kids to meet the so-called-parent-that-wasn't, and a so-called-friend doesn't get to tell you he's wrong and you need to tell him he's wrong along with her to browbeat him into it, this is so so wrong.\n\nPersonally, I have to hope he doesn't forgive her, because she'll probably take it as being in the right and she'll escalate this even further", "Grandparent love IS special and nice but there is no grandparent in the picture as you said, so unfortunately the kids won't experience this love. As for May, what's her problem really? It was none of her business , she sticked her nose in matters that don't concern her. NTA but do keep in mind it's your husband's right in the end , whether he cuts May completely or not. You can do whatever you want.", "NTA - who the hell does this woman think she is??! And to still be texting you afterwards makes me think shes actually insane. Your husband is entitled to pick and choose his friends but I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t want to see her atm anyway.

Haven't you heard the saying \"the road to ruin is paved with good intentions\" How long has she been friends with your husband? Can she not read the room?

She steamrolled some major boundaries because SHE thought your children needed Grandparents. Wtf? You may have toed the line of ah but it was in defense of your husband.
