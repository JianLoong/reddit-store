They wanted HELP, not for someone to come in and completely take over. \"Instantly\" better when you moved in? Really? Did it take 10 seconds or a whole minute before Their Savior calmed the waters of madness?\n\nYou have some major superiority issues that you need to work on, and you also need to understand that it is not YOUR house, these are not YOUR children, you are not some kind of a miracle Super Nanny whipping them all into shape. You're not \"replacing the dad\" but you're sure as hell trying, and you need to cut it out. \n\nBack off. \n\nAre you a help? Of course you are. Another adult in the house is a huge help when there are so many little bodies that need caring for. But I am really betting that if you weren't family, if you weren't contributing financially rather than being paid, that you would have been fired by now. Nobody wants to be made to feel inferior in their own home. You've completely taken over, and you're so busy exclaiming to the world how awesome you are, you haven't even ASKED what help they really needed. \n\nAlso, stop assuming that BIL is upset because YOU were the one to SAVE THE CHILD. Perhaps you aren't looking at the fact that you were supposed to be WATCHING the child, and that if you had been doing the superior job you think you're doing, the kid wouldn't have been \"in for a couple minutes drowning\". You knew the kid was attracted to the water, and you'd already had to keep him out once. Yet, you allowed yourself to get distracted to the point that you didn't see the kid heading for the water again, you didn't see or hear him jump in, and he was drowning for A COUPLE OF MINUTES before you noticed. I'm very very glad the child didn't drown, but my god. Most adults would be excoriating themselves because it even happened, not trumpeting all over the place how your quick reactions saved him. \n\nRein in your enormous ego, ASK your sister and BIL what kind of help they had in mind, and do that. And stop bragging yourself up. \n\nIf you can't do that, move out. You are damaging your relationships and putting additional stress on the parents. \n\nAnd stop sleeping in the same bed with the 5 and 9 year old. It's creepy as hell and completely inappropriate. \n\nYTA", "NTA.

They should be grateful you didn't drop them there and then.", "Gentle YTA, your BIL is going through a lot and didn't say anything negative to you. His child almost drowned, which is traumatic on its own but that's coupled with a depressed wife and high needs kids. Making threats about not helping because you feel slighted is not helpful and quite cruel in my opinion. You know they need, you don't need to rub it in their faces. If your heart isn't in this to support them, then maybe you should step back a little or help them find another solution. \n\nAnd finally parents are allowed to change their minds about things like kids sleeping with adults, it's highly possible they were told this wasn't a great idea by someone or a child expressed concerns. You shouldn't take it personally and should respect that even though you're helping, parents are the ultimate authority on how to raise their children.", "NTA- your BIL seems really insecure.", "NTA.

Your BIL definitely feels some kind of way\u2026I\u2019m sensing inadequate, insecure, less than, being replaced jealousy even. But his feelings are not your responsibility!! Neither of them should if had as many children if they could fully take care of them and support them properly, an do think your Bil realizes that more than your sister does (or at least shows it more). Also, having a chronic health condition like lupus is not easy to deal with either, especially when your a dad to 6 kids and your house is now becoming total chaos. I really think some family counseling would help them all, including the kids. But he doesn\u2019t get to take all his emotions out on you especially when you\u2019re going such a generous and majorly helpful thing for his family!! Good luck and update us on how it\u2019s going!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are being used. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey want a nanny.

So we\u2019ve got the mom who\u2019s been suffering with postpartum issues for a year, dad\u2019s got a chronic illness that\u2019s flaring and OP who\u2019s swooping in to save the day.  I think you\u2019re providing an invaluable service, but are these people using the opportunity to get it together and move toward independence? Is mom seeing a therapist or starting meds? Is dad working with rheum to get the lupus regulated? Are the kids learning to pitch in at age appropriate levels? Bc honestly with six kids and two dysfunctional parents, you\u2019ll be there forever. \n\nI probably have a soft spot for the dad, but ease up on the bravado with how you\u2019re saving the day. The man has a chronic illness, is massively outnumbered at home, and has at least partially been carrying mom from the ppd. He doesn\u2019t need you to swagger around with how adored you are by his kids. Kids naturally adore whoever gives them attention and interest, and this dudes plate is full. He knows his best isn\u2019t enough, he doesn\u2019t need you to reinforce it. \n\nAs an aside, when near any body of water, all adults should be looking out for all kids. I have rescued kids, my kids have been rescued by others. All that matters is everyone is safe. Something tells me you\u2019ve really run with \u201cI saved him!\u201d Good on ya, but if it\u2019s making flaring chronic illness dad feel like garbage, ease up. He knows his reaction time or location at the time of the event were suboptimal, hearing about how you\u2019re a hero nonstop isn\u2019t helpful. \n\nTo summarize: mom needs a therapist, dad needs some rheum appts, watch the kids so those can happen.

That doesn\u2019t make it okay - he could and should\u2019ve raised the issue before, and him being overly critical of things that were fine before is a dick move on his part.\n\nYou need to find a balance between wanting people to value the sacrifices you\u2019re making to support your family and being smug and annoying about it while minimizing their efforts and work as parents.

I don't know, especially when both parents are suffering from an illness and taking care of a special needs child. Like maybe he oversteps often and is arrogant and defensive about it or something. I definitely feel like there's more than is being said. I mean definitely n t a for stepping in to help, but maybe t a h for how? Not sure, but like yourself I feel like something is a bit weird/off.", "I have a large king size bed. You don't even know there's someone in there because it's so big.", "Well, I'm glad he's okay and it's \"just a story\" now. :) It's crazy how things in life can change so quickly! With kids, it's nuts. You really do just turn for two seconds and then BAM...They're like, \"they're not lookin'...Go, go, go!\" haha! I don't have kids of my own, but I have babysat like half my life haha. So, I know that it can be so hard to even turn away for a moment. haha. God, I used to be such a helicopter babysitter.   \n\n\nThe kid would be like, \"Can we go play in the neighbor's yard. Our mom let's us\" and I'm like....\"ummmm, ummm.....How about they come play in OUR yard?\" Even though I  can see the other kids' yard. LOL!   \n\n\nI know, too, what you mean about being annoyed by someone takin' over. My friend just had her first baby a few months ago. And another friend of hers (who is an established mother of toddlers), kept telling her stuff and giving her unsolicited advice, etc, etc. and although she meant well, it was driving my friend crazy because she's like, \"it's my damn kid! Let me do it!\" haha!", "Yeah, that's why I didn't vote. It's definitely nice of OP to jump in and help. For sure. Helping is always good. And no one can be a jerk for genuinely wanting to help. haha. But....Yeah, something's amiss here. So, I didn't vote, like you said, but I am leaning toward ahole. haha. Just because things don't seem right haha", "Sadly, if the kid's teacher hears he is sleeping in the same bed with his uncle, it will be a red flag to a mandated reporter, especially if there are other behavioral issues going on. I don't think you're doing anything wrong but it could look different to someone else. The world is very suspicious of single men.", "I have a king size bed as well so I know how it is, however co-sleeping with kids is seen by many as improper and can lead to terrible accusations, especially for men, unfortunately. You might want to shield yourself from those kinds of accusations by having the boys sleep in separate beds. I know it sucks, but there's usually nothing that can be done to fight society. If one of those boys tells their teacher they sleep with you and you touch them, teachers have to report that to the authorities, and then you'll have to prove it's innocent, even if it's just a hug or back rub after a nightmare. I would hate to see you in that kind of situation,  it ruined many innocent men's lives.", "NTA at all\n\nI don\u2019t get some of these comments. I can ABSOLUTELY believe that things improved when OP arrived. He\u2019s likely younger, fitter, and more fun than dad. Likely has new ideas to keep them happy and entertained. And yes, naturally some adults are just GOOD with kids, and some adults are just not. \n\nMy husband my goodness he can manage our kids and take care of the house at the same time. He\u2019s great at his career but dang he\u2019s a natural at managing how to keep little babies and kids entertained while also cleaning the house. I am nowhere near as good as he is with that stuff. I\u2019m usually I can take care of the kids OR clean but I find it much more difficult than him to simultaneously do both.\n\nMy dad, any baby he is around, they reach out for him. Stranger babies have done this. Babies at restaurants, shopping malls, etc. I don\u2019t know wtf kinda baby scent he gives off but they LOVE IT. My own kids are obsessed with him. \n\nSo yeah can believe absolutely that some people like OP can be much better than the dad, and they honestly should be grateful they have such a caring relative to do this. It\u2019s not easy managing that house. \n\nAnd like he said, he can go if they don\u2019t like it. OP doesn\u2019t seem to care either way, he can stay or go but he won\u2019t be micromanaged and treated like a kid himself.\n\nAnd neither here nor there but they also really need to stop having kids. They need to take care of the kids they have, which they aren\u2019t able to manage. Really sad. No wonder the older kids are going nuts, I would too.", "NTA \n\nSounds like BIL needed to get over himself and be grateful.", "Soft YTA. You casually mention that your BIL has lupus. I assume you know how hard that is for him, but you don't seem to have a lot of sympathy for his situation. It sounds like you are a big help to them, but it's also feeding your ego.", "You sound a bit like a jerk with this situation, (in the ways you talk yourself up) but NTA. Kiddo almost died. They clearly are overwhelmed and need help. Had you not been there, what would\u2019ve happened? They can\u2019t be choosers when they\u2019re so desperate for help. Having that many kids was a choice they made.", "OP's entire post comes off inauthentic, let's be honest.", " I kind of believe that this dad is holding on to some resentment against OP even if his reasoning makes no sense.", "I am amazing", "Just to point out, in a lot of the world bedsharing is common. There is literally nothing creepy or inappropriate about it unless you are thinking certain acts. A lot of kids and adults share due to space issues OR because the kids just like to cuddle and feel safer. Unsure why if the kids are happy and want to sleep next to OP that\u2019s a negative thing? Kids are opinionated, if they don\u2019t want to sleep there, they are gonna complain or move lol", "Yeah his vibes are giving \"I'm better than them. I'm their savior and everything would go to shit with me\", etc. but I don't know. Sometimes men have super irrational reactions to things, especially when it comes to what they believe is competition. It sounds odd but I kind of believe that this dad is holding on to some resentment against OP even if his reasoning makes no sense.", "Yes if I were the father, & OP was to be watching the 3 yo at the pool & almost drowned I\u2019d be pissed too. Not that OP was the one to save the 3 yo but because the incident happened in the first place. If OP was so wonderful he would have not taken his eyes off the kid at all!", "YTA, you keep saying everything thing is better now that you are there.", "Not to nitpick but in the post you say that you both noticed at the same time but you reacted quicker. Now in this comment you say that BIL felt bad for not noticing his kid was drowning. Seems like something is off with your story. Also you say that you saw it happen and reacted immediately so how was the kid drowning for a couple of minutes? You then asked him if he was mad cuz he thought you were replacing him, where did that come from? But what really bothers me is that you say if they don't like how you're helping then you won't help at all. Helping is being or doing what they need, you choosing how you help or nothing isn't really helping then is it? Something is definitely missing from your story and I think you are painting yourself as this amazing life saver and trying to make it seem like you're the good guy and they are ungrateful so that no one will vote you as TA. Just my opinion.", "If BIL has a problem with it, it's obviously not common where he is.", "Oh, bullshit. You specifically said that you were taking on the 3, 5, 9 year olds. You said that you had just caught the kid trying to get in the pool. You were also outside with the kids. You're trying to say that of all the kids, BIL was only watching one of them, and it happened to be the one (who YOU had already seen was a risk by the pool) that jumped in? \n\nYou \\*really\\* don't like being shown faults, do you?", "Sadly true, but we can certainly judge the people with too many kids BEFORE that happened.", "Sharing a bed has been linked to behavioral and sleep-related problems. Not necessarily direct cause, but correlated. You need to be wary of it. Kids their age should be starting the night sleeping on their own. If they wake up in the middle of the night and jump in your bed because of a nightmare, that's another thing.", "I've known Brent since high school.", "Except he was suppose to watching him. I was watching a third of his kids.", "It might not be. OP did not mention details. \n\nI was simply replying to your comment of \u201cIt's creepy as hell and completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nEdit: also, OP has been there for 4 months. I\u2019m guessing the bed sharing didn\u2019t start yesterday. So why is BIL asking to switch now when he was seemingly fine with it before? With the limited info we have, seems like it was at least common enough in their area for both mom and dad to not have issues with it before. And mom still doesn\u2019t have an issue with it.", "My sister was inside taking care of th3 baby.\n\nThe older two were in the bedrooms probably doing personal things.\n\nI was with the 5 and 9yo outside.\n\nMy BIL was with the 3yo in the pool.", "Oh please. There are plenty of other things that go on or went on that would raise bigger red flags.", "What does that have to do with what they said? Did you think that maybe Brent was just being more hands on because his child could\u2019ve died and not because of some petty feud with you?", "Maybe he feels guilty because he missed seeing his son nearly drown?! That's totally normal.", "After a discussion I had with him about co-sleeping, I'm going with YTA. He's very arrogant and defensive of his position and why anyone would question anything he does. Sounds like an AH to me and insufferable to boot.", "That's their problem.", "First off, why would they say anything to their teacher to begin with? \n\nSecond of all, there are far worse things that have gone on", "Dude you're so fucking weird", "First off - If a teacher, who is a mandatory reporter, hears that you all are sharing a bed, you can bet your bottom dollar that teacher is going to ask more questions,  a lot more. \n\nSecond of all - if, during the course of that questioning the teacher hears of these \"far worse things\" those kids could end up in foster care until the household is deemed safe for those children. \n\nSeems better to just end the co-sleeping arrangement to avoid the risk of the kids ending up in foster care. \n\nAlso, if there are \"far worse things\" happening in the household, why haven't you stepped up to stop them or report them? Seems weird that a caring uncle would tolerate abuse of his niblings.  Your whole attitude in this thread tells me exactly why your BIL is acting the way he is towards you.  YTA"]}
