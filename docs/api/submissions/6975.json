They wanted HELP, not for someone to come in and completely take over. \"Instantly\" better when you moved in? Really? Did it take 10 seconds or a whole minute before Their Savior calmed the waters of madness?\n\nYou have some major superiority issues that you need to work on, and you also need to understand that it is not YOUR house, these are not YOUR children, you are not some kind of a miracle Super Nanny whipping them all into shape. You're not \"replacing the dad\" but you're sure as hell trying, and you need to cut it out. \n\nBack off. \n\nAre you a help? Of course you are. Another adult in the house is a huge help when there are so many little bodies that need caring for. But I am really betting that if you weren't family, if you weren't contributing financially rather than being paid, that you would have been fired by now. Nobody wants to be made to feel inferior in their own home. You've completely taken over, and you're so busy exclaiming to the world how awesome you are, you haven't even ASKED what help they really needed. \n\nAlso, stop assuming that BIL is upset because YOU were the one to SAVE THE CHILD. Perhaps you aren't looking at the fact that you were supposed to be WATCHING the child, and that if you had been doing the superior job you think you're doing, the kid wouldn't have been \"in for a couple minutes drowning\". You knew the kid was attracted to the water, and you'd already had to keep him out once. Yet, you allowed yourself to get distracted to the point that you didn't see the kid heading for the water again, you didn't see or hear him jump in, and he was drowning for A COUPLE OF MINUTES before you noticed. I'm very very glad the child didn't drown, but my god. Most adults would be excoriating themselves because it even happened, not trumpeting all over the place how your quick reactions saved him. \n\nRein in your enormous ego, ASK your sister and BIL what kind of help they had in mind, and do that. And stop bragging yourself up. \n\nIf you can't do that, move out. You are damaging your relationships and putting additional stress on the parents. \n\nAnd stop sleeping in the same bed with the 5 and 9 year old. It's creepy as hell and completely inappropriate. \n\nYTA", "NTA.

They should be grateful you didn't drop them there and then.", "Gentle YTA, your BIL is going through a lot and didn't say anything negative to you. His child almost drowned, which is traumatic on its own but that's coupled with a depressed wife and high needs kids. Making threats about not helping because you feel slighted is not helpful and quite cruel in my opinion. You know they need, you don't need to rub it in their faces. If your heart isn't in this to support them, then maybe you should step back a little or help them find another solution. \n\nAnd finally parents are allowed to change their minds about things like kids sleeping with adults, it's highly possible they were told this wasn't a great idea by someone or a child expressed concerns. You shouldn't take it personally and should respect that even though you're helping, parents are the ultimate authority on how to raise their children.", "NTA- your BIL seems really insecure.", "NTA.

That should stop.

Your BIL definitely feels some kind of way\u2026I\u2019m sensing inadequate, insecure, less than, being replaced jealousy even. But his feelings are not your responsibility!! Neither of them should if had as many children if they could fully take care of them and support them properly, an do think your Bil realizes that more than your sister does (or at least shows it more). Also, having a chronic health condition like lupus is not easy to deal with either, especially when your a dad to 6 kids and your house is now becoming total chaos. I really think some family counseling would help them all, including the kids. But he doesn\u2019t get to take all his emotions out on you especially when you\u2019re going such a generous and majorly helpful thing for his family!! Good luck and update us on how it\u2019s going!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are being used. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey want a nanny.

So we\u2019ve got the mom who\u2019s been suffering with postpartum issues for a year, dad\u2019s got a chronic illness that\u2019s flaring and OP who\u2019s swooping in to save the day.  I think you\u2019re providing an invaluable service, but are these people using the opportunity to get it together and move toward independence? Is mom seeing a therapist or starting meds? Is dad working with rheum to get the lupus regulated? Are the kids learning to pitch in at age appropriate levels? Bc honestly with six kids and two dysfunctional parents, you\u2019ll be there forever. \n\nI probably have a soft spot for the dad, but ease up on the bravado with how you\u2019re saving the day. The man has a chronic illness, is massively outnumbered at home, and has at least partially been carrying mom from the ppd. He doesn\u2019t need you to swagger around with how adored you are by his kids. Kids naturally adore whoever gives them attention and interest, and this dudes plate is full. He knows his best isn\u2019t enough, he doesn\u2019t need you to reinforce it. \n\nAs an aside, when near any body of water, all adults should be looking out for all kids. I have rescued kids, my kids have been rescued by others. All that matters is everyone is safe. Something tells me you\u2019ve really run with \u201cI saved him!\u201d Good on ya, but if it\u2019s making flaring chronic illness dad feel like garbage, ease up. He knows his reaction time or location at the time of the event were suboptimal, hearing about how you\u2019re a hero nonstop isn\u2019t helpful. \n\nTo summarize: mom needs a therapist, dad needs some rheum appts, watch the kids so those can happen.

That doesn\u2019t make it okay - he could and should\u2019ve raised the issue before, and him being overly critical of things that were fine before is a dick move on his part.\n\nYou need to find a balance between wanting people to value the sacrifices you\u2019re making to support your family and being smug and annoying about it while minimizing their efforts and work as parents.

I don't know, especially when both parents are suffering from an illness and taking care of a special needs child. Like maybe he oversteps often and is arrogant and defensive about it or something. I definitely feel like there's more than is being said. I mean definitely n t a for stepping in to help, but maybe t a h for how?

You don't even know there's someone in there because it's so big.", "Well, I'm glad he's okay and it's \"just a story\" now. :) It's crazy how things in life can change so quickly! With kids, it's nuts. You really do just turn for two seconds and then BAM...They're like, \"they're not lookin'...Go, go, go!\" haha! I don't have kids of my own, but I have babysat like half my life haha. So, I know that it can be so hard to even turn away for a moment. haha. God, I used to be such a helicopter babysitter.   \n\n\nThe kid would be like, \"Can we go play in the neighbor's yard. Our mom let's us\" and I'm like....\"ummmm, ummm.....How about they come play in OUR yard?\" Even though I  can see the other kids' yard. LOL!   \n\n\nI know, too, what you mean about being annoyed by someone takin' over. My friend just had her first baby a few months ago. And another friend of hers (who is an established mother of toddlers), kept telling her stuff and giving her unsolicited advice, etc, etc. and although she meant well, it was driving my friend crazy because she's like, \"it's my damn kid! Let me do it!\" haha!", "Yeah, that's why I didn't vote. It's definitely nice of OP to jump in and help. For sure. Helping is always good.

The world is very suspicious of single men.", "I have a king size bed as well so I know how it is, however co-sleeping with kids is seen by many as improper and can lead to terrible accusations, especially for men, unfortunately. You might want to shield yourself from those kinds of accusations by having the boys sleep in separate beds. I know it sucks, but there's usually nothing that can be done to fight society. If one of those boys tells their teacher they sleep with you and you touch them, teachers have to report that to the authorities, and then you'll have to prove it's innocent, even if it's just a hug or back rub after a nightmare. I would hate to see you in that kind of situation,  it ruined many innocent men's lives.", "NTA at all\n\nI don\u2019t get some of these comments.

He\u2019s great at his career but dang he\u2019s a natural at managing how to keep little babies and kids entertained while also cleaning the house. I am nowhere near as good as he is with that stuff. I\u2019m usually I can take care of the kids OR clean but I find it much more difficult than him to simultaneously do both.\n\nMy dad, any baby he is around, they reach out for him. Stranger babies have done this. Babies at restaurants, shopping malls, etc. I don\u2019t know wtf kinda baby scent he gives off but they LOVE IT. My own kids are obsessed with him. \n\nSo yeah can believe absolutely that some people like OP can be much better than the dad, and they honestly should be grateful they have such a caring relative to do this. It\u2019s not easy managing that house. \n\nAnd like he said, he can go if they don\u2019t like it. OP doesn\u2019t seem to care either way, he can stay or go but he won\u2019t be micromanaged and treated like a kid himself.\n\nAnd neither here nor there but they also really need to stop having kids.

Also you say that you saw it happen and reacted immediately so how was the kid drowning for a couple of minutes? You then asked him if he was mad cuz he thought you were replacing him, where did that come from?

Helping is being or doing what they need, you choosing how you help or nothing isn't really helping then is it?

I\u2019m guessing the bed sharing didn\u2019t start yesterday. So why is BIL asking to switch now when he was seemingly fine with it before?

There are plenty of other things that go on or went on that would raise bigger red flags.", "What does that have to do with what they said?

He's incredible with our son, despite not being a parent, and he is always proud of what a good Uncle he is. It did get a bit under my husband's skin because he worried that our son preferred his \"Uncle\" to him-- which wasn't the case. We moved 2,000 miles away and I sure miss his help.

I think OP may be setting off BIL's insecurity and escalating it. \n\nThere's a lot ppl learn through their 20s about how to go into someone else's house. BIL might be trying to separate you from the kids because they're tweens and he doesn't want them acting the way that you're acting -- from a place of martyrdom/bossyness/mom and dad don't know anything? He might also sense that you're building power for a rebellion :) Which if that is in any way true, you ARE actually trying to be another parent and you should examine that. You are basically a nanny. Or a hospice worker. Try going into a house as a healthcare worker and telling people how they should live and what they're doing wrong.

If so, maybe he could take a bit more time for himself and remind himself of his own passions. Go on a date. Get out a bit. \n\nI think OP could shift the dynamic with a little attitude adjustment and humility, just backing off for a bit and being graceful in allowing BIL to spend more time with the kids. Which was after all the point, to support the family in having calmer days and better relationships. You are the fun uncle (contractor), not the parent (CEO/project manager). You don't have ultimate sign-on-the-line responsibility, and you don't get to judge the big picture. You get to judge the moment-to-moment to the best of your ability, and check in a lot with the project manager.\n\nIt's hard to be a support person, people socialized as women in most cultures learn that a lot earlier than men. These are all grey areas, I think if you can take the pressure off and stop making this A Thing/locking horns with your BIL, it will dissipate.

Him saying that you completely disappear if you're not allowed to sleep in the same bed as his niblings is a reason for him to leave and not come back", "What makes the poster an asshole is he has the delusions of grandeur, and if his brother-in-law tries to set reasonable limits with him, he threatens his sister with completely pulling out his support. He then tells his sister that her house will descend into chaos if he's not there, when he knows she is struggling and dealing with postpartum.\n\nHe's an asshole because he's in someone else's house, telling them they can't set any limits with him or he will leave. He's not a hero when his support is entirely dependent on him having complete control of someone else's house", "My brother's second wife had an out-of-control child from a previous marriage.  Bio dad and his family wanted nothing to do with kid because of his behavior issues.  Bro moved in/eventually married her - keep in mind this was a man who did not want kids EVER - and suddenly the boy's behavior changed completely.  Turns out he needed an adult that didn't fall for his crap but would always be there for him.  When he had issues at school, it was my bro who went up to the school.  When he was getting bullied, my brother dealt with it.  When the kid's girlfriend broke up with him, he would only talk about it with my brother.\n\nThe boy is now an adult and calls my brother dad.  He stayed with my brother after the divorce - his own choice.  If you ask him why, it's because my brother has always been there for him.  He helped him when he was diagnosed as dyslexic and having ADHD, and was failing school.  He put him through rehab 3 times when he developed a drug and alcohol problem.  He told him he always had a home even when the boy decided to leave because he didn't like the rules (get a job, finish school, do chores).  This young man told us that the only person who never gave up on him and walked out of his life was my brother.", "Then it sounds like you should start staying at your house more. The issue is one of the parents in the house is saying that you're over and involved too much. You need to back off", "That is your opinion.  Your BIL might not actually feel this way. Telling them that makes you a huge AH.", "And getting to personally assign yourself the title of savior, the only one that keeps this house from descending into chaos", "yeah man. I read this and thought this dude is insane. Something else is going on.", "And you are specifically threatening your sister with not helping her at all when she is struggling, and telling her that everything will fall to pieces if you're not there. It's extremely manipulative and very wrong given that you know your sister is struggling and wants your help", "You come across as having a savior complex. Yes you are helping but your wording makes it clear you do think you are a better parent. YTA.", "ESH, while you're clearly helping you do need to respect that ultimately he's the parent and you seem to think you have some kind of supernatural right to do whatever because you're living there. \n\nJust be kind or leave.", "NTA", "I read the post several times and couldn't decide who was the AH. This post seems heavily coated to make you in positive light but I genuinely would like to learn your brother in law's point of story.\nHowever, after reading your responses in several of tge comments OP I am inclining towards \nYTD", "NTA. They need to make up their mind here.", "Esh why is young child allowed near the pool alone?  That should be impossible", "If they're fighting about you, it's time to leave. Wither your making things better or not for the kids. You don't want to be the reason they get a divorce.  That might cause resentment from the kids towards you. \n\nTime to go.", "I feel you could move out and be in your own place at night. Help during the day. Slowly decrease your time there. I get the parents need/want help but you also have to know your place as an uncle and maybe you are starting to overstep boundaries but they don\u2019t have the heart to tell you that because of how much you have helped them out.", "YTA. Straight up. You sound like you are viewing them as incompetent and you as the hero saving every one here. Glad you got the 3 yr old. Good job on that. Maybe take a step back and remember that 1) you aren't the parent; 2) it's not your house; and 3) they aren't your kids. You are third in line here. It sounds like that is the boundary you are refusing to acknowledge you have crossed or even acknowledge as a boundary that exists in this dynamic. Once you start believing you are the one and only savior for this family, you start believing you are owed more and have more power than you truly do. Reconsider your perspective on this.", "Absolutely, reading the thread you'd think the would fall in on their heads should op leave.... Op, you were 'in charge' of the child that nearly drowned. You left him unattended near a swimming pool and went off to do whatever.  That means it's your fault he very nearly drowned.  That doesn't make you a hero in anyone's book.", "Agree that it *doesn\u2019t* make sense for a parent to be annoyed at someone else for saving their drowning kid.\n\nIt *does* make sense to me for a parent to be annoyed at someone else because they were the one caring for the kid at the time that the kid started to drown\u2026\ud83e\udd14", "I think Brent is concerned about the same thing we\u2019re all concerned about here. I worked in a children\u2019s acute psych hospital, specifically with males who had sexual trauma. Every single comment you\u2019ve made is a red flag. That doesn\u2019t mean I know you\u2019re molesting your nephews, but I can tell you it seems like you\u2019re grooming them. \n\n-what\u2019s wrong with them sleeping in my bed with me?\nSeveral things actually, and I don\u2019t believe you are so obtuse as to just \u201cnot get it\u201d \n\n-that\u2019s their problem\nIf a teacher were to be concerned enough to hotline, it is their responsibility to do so. It\u2019s not \u201ctheir problem\u201d it\u2019s their duty. Maybe consider for a min that how YOU feel about this situation is NOT what\u2019s important, it is the wellbeing of the children involved- and you\u2019re lack of understanding and consideration demonstrated in your comments is quite more revealing than you might realize.\n\n-they behave a lot better than before\nAgain, the fact you\u2019re actually contributing this to your presence, for ANY other reason than the additional attention they are getting is pause for concern. There a 6 children- one who is special needs, and 2 ailing parents. This suggests that they\u2019re attention starved. Here\u2019s the thing about kids who\u2019s needs go unmet in a home\u2026 they will do just about anything for it, and it doesn\u2019t even have to be positive, negative attention will do just as well. \n\nThe children are at a very high risk for being victimized, and the fact that you are conflating your purpose there and commenting the things you\u2019re commenting, has me very worried for your nephews. I think you\u2019re grooming them, things haven\u2019t escalated past that, and this post is meant to deduce how safe you would be doing so.\n\nObviously, I don\u2019t know, but I feel certain enough to ask that you please for the sake of those boys get them out of your fucking bed before you cause irreparable trauma.", "You need to stop the bullshit, and get the fuck out of their house.", "I'm not talking about sitting down for a discussion w/the kids, I'm talking about your sister and BIL."]}
