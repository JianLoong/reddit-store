T has a husband (K) who I have never gotten along with. When I first met him he didn't like me very much.

Well a couple weeks ago my best friend asks me to be one of the people in the delivery room with her since we have known other since the 2nd grade. Of course I accepted. So fast forward too the day T's water broke. Me and her were already somewhat close to the hospital since a lot of the food places we got to are only 10 minutes away. So we get to the hospital and K is already on the way. K arrives and immediately scowls at me asking \"Wtf is she doing here\" I just ignored him and focused on T. Well soon enough is was time. T went into labor but instead of grabbing K's hand for support T grabbed mine. K was obviously upset about this and told me to leave the delivery room and wait outside. I was about to go outside when T grabbed my hand and told me to stay. So I stayed. K got so mad he ended up leaving the hospital all together. I stayed with T until she was released from the hospital and she asked me to move in with her for moral support. (Just background K wasn't moved in with her they had separate houses). So I moved in. K found thus out and has been telling his friends that I was trying to take his role as the babies father. T's was getting hateful texts for K saying how I should butt off of their lives now. T has had enough and ended up saying \"If you can't respect my best friend then don't come and visit\". I feel really bad.

In a labor room, the wish of the person doing the labor is the most important, and especially since she had ask you before.

They are married living separately and now you have moved in with her?

When your friend needed support, comfort, and to feel safe, she chose you \u2014 not her husband. And why wouldn\u2019t she? K sounds volatile and more concerned with his ego than with his wife.

Doctors, nurses and midwives will have her back because she\u2019s the one at risk. They will even kick the husband out if that is what she wanted. Even you supported her choice.\n\nBut her own husband couldn\u2019t even support her decision.

He needs to butt out of yalls life", "NTA. Giving birth is both painful and scary AF. When she grabbed your hand, and not his, she was making a really honest choice, because the situation had stripped her of any falsehoods. She needed you; you stayed. As for the rest? It's a stretch to think their relationship will last--the guy had a hissyfit, and put his emotions and ego ahead of staying to witness the birth of his own child.", "Sounds like your all assholes.", "I swear, it feels like at least a third of the posts I read in here have something to do with incompatible people in relationships, often furthering the divide by having children.", "_\"If you can't respect my best friend then don't come and visit\"._\n\nThis marriage sounds like it is in shambles. I am all for the mom-to-be having whoever she wants in the delivery soon as her support sysyem - though I think the dad should have been told ahead of time given this mutually acidic dynamic with OP. But, I can't imagine a wife moving OP in (again, given this dynamic) and telling their husband that if he doesn't want to deal with OP then he isn't welcome to come to her home - and by extension see his child. That's messed up. \n\nOP's friend and her husband sound like they are headed for divorce, and that guy needs to speak with an attorney asap to sort custody of his child.", "Doesn't sound to me like he's going to do much co-parenting whether they stay married or not.\n\n(NTA OP. K's tantrum is probably a sign of the many reasons T asked you to be in the delivery room with her, because she could rely on you for support.)", "This is a completely dysfunctional relationship.  I can\u2019t say I would be ok with my wife\u2019s best friend being there and kinda taking the role as her support system in the birth of my child.  Completely would kill that bonding moment for mother, child, and father that I had with mine.  This pretty much means he isn\u2019t her support system at all though, living separate as a married couple having a child, just bizarre.  \n\nI mean you are NTA for wanting to help your friend, but this type of drama would be way too much for me to be involved in.  This sounds like the making of one of those stories that end badly.", "Probably why OP was asked to be support person in the first place...I'm betting that the friend in labor \\*knew\\* that baby daddy would throw a tantrum/be unsupportive during birth", "it sounds like he wants to isolate her from her friends, starting with you.", "> I can\u2019t say I would be ok with my wife\u2019s best friend being there and kinda taking the role as her support system in the birth of my child.\n\nYou probably gaf about your wife, so she *would* depend upon you for support.  OP's friend's husband doesn't gaf about her, as he clearly demonstrated by throwing a temper tantrum and leaving the hospital while his wife was in labor and giving birth.  It's a very good thing it went smoothly, and OP's friend didn't need him to make medical decisions for her.", "This is what worried me, too. It's a little encouraging that he tries to make nice with her other friends. If he starts chasing other people off or tossing out them-or-me ultimatums, then he's headed down the road to escalating abuse."]}
