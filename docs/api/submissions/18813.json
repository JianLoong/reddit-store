T has a husband (K) who I have never gotten along with. When I first met him he didn't like me very much. He was rude a snappy and honestly I was too so our relationship never really got past the enemy stage. Well a couple weeks ago my best friend asks me to be one of the people in the delivery room with her since we have known other since the 2nd grade. Of course I accepted. So fast forward too the day T's water broke. Me and her were already somewhat close to the hospital since a lot of the food places we got to are only 10 minutes away. So we get to the hospital and K is already on the way. K arrives and immediately scowls at me asking \"Wtf is she doing here\" I just ignored him and focused on T. Well soon enough is was time. T went into labor but instead of grabbing K's hand for support T grabbed mine. K was obviously upset about this and told me to leave the delivery room and wait outside. I was about to go outside when T grabbed my hand and told me to stay. So I stayed. K got so mad he ended up leaving the hospital all together. I stayed with T until she was released from the hospital and she asked me to move in with her for moral support. (Just background K wasn't moved in with her they had separate houses). So I moved in. K found thus out and has been telling his friends that I was trying to take his role as the babies father. T's was getting hateful texts for K saying how I should butt off of their lives now. T has had enough and ended up saying \"If you can't respect my best friend then don't come and visit\". I feel really bad. I'm not trying to drive them apart I am only trying to support my best friend.

In a labor room, the wish of the person doing the labor is the most important, and especially since she had ask you before.

He\u2019s a real piece.", "I don't know how to judge this, normally I would feel you are overstepping and should give them time together with their baby, but it really sounds like there are cracks in their relationship. They are married living separately and now you have moved in with her? I would think if their relationship is even going to have a shot they should be together and you should be offering support from the sidelines, the fact that isn't like that means I assume your friend is re-evaluating her relationship anyway.\n\nINFO he clearly doesn't like you, likely jealousy since 3 is a crowd, but has your friend ever found him abusive to her?", "NTA. When your friend needed support, comfort, and to feel safe, she chose you \u2014 not her husband. And why wouldn\u2019t she? K sounds volatile and more concerned with his ego than with his wife. The fact that he sees you as competition instead of as an asset in his wife\u2019s corner couldn\u2019t be a bigger red flag. K needs to get his head right or he has no business being a husband or a father.\n\nQuestion: Is K friendly with *anyone* who is emotionally close to your bestie? \u201cNo\u201d would be a very worrisome sign.", "NTA.

Period", "NTA, sounds like he\u2019s trying to be controlling, and it\u2019s not working out for him very well. He is the one making all these decisions to be out of his baby\u2019s life because *checks notes* you\u2019re more supportive of his wife than he is.", "You are being there for you friend. Giving birth is NOT easy.  it is scary for many women, particular faith the first child.\n\nI wouldn't stay too long (two weeks, maybe?)  You have to read the room and decide.  \n\n At one point, T has to face K and they need to figure their couple stuff out.  That is something you should stay out of.\n\nNTA for being present at the brith and staying with T for the first few days.", "NTA. This was your friends decision, not yours. If at any time she wanted you to leave the nurses would have handled it. The person who makes the decision on who stays in the room is the person giving birth. If her partner doesn\u2019t like that, that\u2019s too bad.", "NTA. When K delivers a baby, he can decide who he has in the room with him. Until then, he can shut up and listen to the person doing the work.", "NTA.

It sounds like he is hiding something from her and thereby from you. \nDon't feel too bad over it and focus on T and the baby. \n\nHowever, be ready to have a VERY SERIOUS conversation with T. She kinda owes you the truthfulness of how you got into the situation.", "Some times peoppe dont recognize theyre being abused because they dont see anything wrong with how theyre brong treated", "Don\u2019t poke holes.
