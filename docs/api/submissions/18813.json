It\u2019s not your fault her husband can\u2019t be that for her. Yes you stepping up is interfering with his position as father and husband but that\u2019s bc of his choices not yours.", "NTA. You were there at your friends request, and she confirmed this when her husband tried to throw you out. That marriage is dead.", "NTA you\u2019ll be best friends forever and her husband doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s going to be in the picture much longer.", "This relationship without your interference is already a mess . Why are they married and having a baby but not living together? Imo it was messy having the both of y\u2019all in the room together knowing you don\u2019t get along everyone is an ah in my eyes ESH", "Esh. Just date your \"friend\" already.", "NTA - I almost feel like she's afraid of her husband. Definitely some serious issues between them.", "It states OP is 23F", "This, if her actual husband can\u2019t give her the support she needs then she was smart to ask you to be there. Being there for a birth means being selfless and supporting the mom no matter what happens and she knew deep down he couldn\u2019t do it. The fact that they are married and not living together speaks volumes. NTA. You can\u2019t get sensitive and leave in the middle of a birth, one of my quietest, mild mannered friends lost it in the middle of birthing and I\u2019ve never heard her say a curse word but she told her husband to \u201cjust find the fucking dr because I\u2019m ready to push\u2019 and he did it. He didn\u2019t get butt hurt and leave, he stayed because he was committed and knew she needed support no matter what she did or said, birthing is not for the weak or sensitive, there might be poop, blood, an emergency c-section or all 3, you gotta be prepared for whatever happens.", "Maybe this is why, generally, 22 year olds shouldn't get married.  It doesn't sound like anyone in this situation is mature enough for marriage.  Ugh, or children.", "Right.\n\nLike, it's... _weird_ for them to not be on the same page or even in the same damn book here. Wife is making moves you do when the baby daddy isn't around. And come to find out he isn't on paper _and_ nobody seemed to have a problem with this?", "You see how weird it is that they live apart though, right?", "Ok, but it's not YOUR decision who her birthing partner is; it's her labor and delivery, not yours.  She is the only person who is allowed to make the call on who her birthing partner is and who is in the room during the birth.  And it's not dysfunctional to have it be someone other than your baby's other parent.\n\nBut tbh, this post smells fake.", "I mean he wasn't the one pushing a human out of his vagina, so it doesn't really matter since it wasn't his support system.", "I didn't even see the ages, but now things make _so_ much more sense. These folks is babies.", "Tbh it doesn't sound like a very planned child", "I mean, she invited OP to the delivery room knowing her husband hates OP, asked OP to stay when husband tried to throw OP away, doesn't seem to care that (at least based on the post) her husband stormed out of the HOSPITAL, after all the drama she still invited OP to live with her to help her out.\n\nIt seems she's already checked out of her marriage and wants what is good for her future and is done playing along with her husband. OP, it seems she needs you now more than ever. Have a conversation with her to understand how to best support her and help her \n\nNTA", "> It's a little encouraging that he tries to make nice with her other friends.\n\nIt's not uncommon for them to single out one or two friends or relatives in the beginning.  If they're successful with those, they move on to the victim's other friends and relatives.", "Info: Do you or have you ever had romantic feelings for her?", "She\u2019s in an abusive relationship and you\u2019re probably saving her butt \n\nGreat job OP way to kill it with kindness", "Sounds like the friend has a husband problem. You did as the laboring mother asked. NTA\n\nIf they part ways it has nothing to do with you. Their issues run deeper, I'm sure.", "NTA.  Your friend asked you to be there and reiterated she wanted to stay when you went to leave.  It was about giving the comfort and support not someone's fragile ego.", "NTA - your friend wanted you there. But what is this weird relationship setup where theyre living in seperate homes??", "He chose his ego over witnessing the birth of his own child, nothing more to say here, NTA and please try to find out if your friend is okay or if he's been trying to isolate and/or abuse her", "They live in separate houses?  Weird. Anyway she wanted you not K so you have nothing to be worried about", "NTA the only person's opinion when it comes to who's in the delivery room is the person who's giving birth. End of story. He was childish for walking out when his partner needed support and missing the birth of his child. You moving in to help your friend is actually a very sweet gesture. She's healing on top of a newborn is very demanding physically and emotionally. It would be hell for her to do it alone since it seems the baby daddy doesn't actually want to help raise the child since he took the first chance to run away before the kid was even born. They already had issues it sounds like and that has nothing to do with you. He's projecting and trying to use you as an excuse to be a shitty partner and father. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this is leading to him using you as a scapegoat for him being a complete dead beat and abandoning them both. Childish, petty, manipulative people will blame everyone but themselves for their actions. Be prepared for your friend to end up a single parent. It won't be your fault just be ready. He stepped out out of one of the biggest moments of their relationship already and already failed to be there for their child from day one. Don't bring it up now because the mom needs time to heal and rest plus bond with baby but in the future if I were you I would bring up any concerns you have regarding it. Clear the air.", "NTA", "NTA. if he\u2019s so bent outta shape maybe he should\u2019ve stepped up and moved in idk just a thought", "NTA\n\nBut your friend T needs to figure out her shit with her husband K, and leave you out of it.", "You and the baby are probably the only normal and innocent ones here\n\nThe father seems like a piece of work..\nBut honestly the mother doesn't sound amazing either\n\nI get why the guy might be upset, if I was in that situation and had my wife go to someone else for support that would be hard to not take to heart, though obviously he shouldn't have told you to leave... being understandably upset doesn't excuse anything\nAlso I see why she might turn to you for support instead... they don't even live together...\n\nBut the mother... she goes to you for support, she wants you to move in with her, he basically tells the father off for not liking it....\n\nThat marriage is in an awful place and she's definitely not helping that or trying to improve, so they're both equally responsible for that\n\n\nYou, however, just got stuck in the middle and just want to be there and support your friend, even to the point of butting out and supporting them both by not pushing them apart\nThat's admirable\n\nDefinitely NTA, but the parents have issues lol... and they should speak to therapists and if that fails, lawyers", "NTA", "NTA at all. It sounds like he dislikes you, and for no good reason. So much so that he got his little feelings all hurty-hurt, like a whiny, little baby. What an idiot. He seriously needs to grow the f up.", "Ima abstain.\n\nBut it def feels like your friend is using you in places, she should be using her husband.", "Honestly it sounds like she wanted OP there as she knew who would be more supportive.\nSounds like thing are already not working out with husband.\nNTA. Your friend needed you and you were there.", "This one is really confusing to me, firstly why aren\u2019t they living together for many reasons\u2026\n\nSecondly how old is the dad, not that age would give reason for stomping out on his first child but I certainly had a hard time with my first child losing all my freedoms, time and money and I was 27. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I didn\u2019t behave like this but if my wife at the time would had preferred for someone other than me to be at the child birth, and even more so chosen to hold someone else\u2019s hand I would have taken it very strongly that she didn\u2019t want me - and then wasn\u2019t the time to discuss these matters. \n\nGiven her BFF was there for her I\u2019m slightly thinking that stepping out of the room instead causing a fuss was the right thing to do and it was a lose lose scenario for him. I can agree he shouldn\u2019t have left the hospital and entered the room when the energy was calmer to meet his child. \n\nI\u2019m thinking OP is possibly enabling the separation of T and K maybe in a way others are suggesting the husband is, maybe she\u2019s isolating her to not lose her BFF and has been gently whispering in her ear?\n\nWe\u2019re simply missing too much of this picture to draw any reasonable conclusions and I don\u2019t want OP to read all the NTA comments and think 100% she is in the right, show these comments to her BFF and the child be forced out having a dad because of a toxic friendship preventing a relationship. \n\nTLDR; this is missing too much information and everyone needs to take a step back and put the child first.", "Absolutely. The person giving birth is the person HAVING A MEDICAL EVENT.

The friend could takse the place of a doula, but they would have to do what a doula would do. But it is 100% vital that the team works well together. If the friend and husband don't get along, it is a very bad idea to have them both in the room. \n\nAnd the husband is useless unless he knows what is going on and supports the mother. No use in just hangin around and being oblivious.", "We have proof dog exists. :)", "This is why I'm curious as to how old the husband is.", "just because these people ren\u2018t mature doesn\u2018t mean everybody is.", "It\u2019s two young people making rash and frankly not wise decisions.

That's something you normally would mention.", "She's the one pushing a melon out of her vagina. She is the ONLY one who has a say who is in the room.", "Now they are *roomates*", "I was 23 ish before i realized that i was being abused. I grew up through it and it was all i ever knew.", "or she couldve told him, but he thought she meant \"hospital waiting room\" and not \"in the actual room\"."]}
