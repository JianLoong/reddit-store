T went into labor but instead of grabbing K's hand for support T grabbed mine. K was obviously upset about this and told me to leave the delivery room and wait outside. I was about to go outside when T grabbed my hand and told me to stay. So I stayed. K got so mad he ended up leaving the hospital all together. I stayed with T until she was released from the hospital and she asked me to move in with her for moral support. (Just background K wasn't moved in with her they had separate houses). So I moved in.

It would be hell for her to do it alone since it seems the baby daddy doesn't actually want to help raise the child since he took the first chance to run away before the kid was even born.
