I wanna do it, that for sure, but I'm trying to figure out the terms bcs I don't wanna make the same mistakes I made in my previous relationship \u2014LSS, investing energy, money and time in a house that was HIS and, when we broke up, I had to go back to my parents' place emotionally and financially broke.\n\nSo I've been thinking splitting the expenses on supplies, food or new furniture is 100% the right thing, but not the mortgage. I don't feel confortable paying for a house mortgage that is his, because that establishes an \"unprotected landlord-tenant\" relationship between us (i.e., uneven relationship where one of us is in an advantageous position).\n\nI don't wanna feel that he's got all the control over the roof over my head and, if we split or sth bad happens to him, I'm left with nothing again. If we ever get married or he includes me in his will (sth that will be put on the table in 2/3 years if everything goes well), then I'll for sure pay my part of the mortgage, because then we'll be on the same page towards the house.\n\nAITA for establishing these terms?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your comments! You gave me some good points and options I'll consider. Just wanted to clarify I'm not looking for a free ride at all. I just wanna make sure I don't make the same mistakes again and move in without thinking it twice.

An arrangement where you pay less than what you would for rent in such a place (because it's unfair if you pay equally when he actually owns the place) but where you do contribute to the mortgage in the form of rent (because you shouldn't be fully provided by him as you are a couple and a team, working together for your goals) is needed.", "Maybe a better solution would be to look at comps in the area.

Maybe don't pay 50% of mortgage, but paying 20% plus half of food, supplies and utilities would be fair. And give it a year timeline. If the relationship hasn't gone anywhere after a year, you may want to consider moving out and trying to buy your own place. But I would consider a year of paying some of the mortgage (as rent) a reasonable risk under the above conditions.\n\nIf on the other hand, you guys don't have any idea where this is heading, you don't know if you will get married, and he isn't open to the idea of adding you to the title for the house, then I wouldn't move in with him.

It should spell out how much notice he has to give you to enter your private areas like your bedroom. It should specify how quickly he has to send someone to repair or replace broken appliances, plumbing issues, damage to the roof, etc. Oh and he has to agree to pay for all that stuff, no trying to convince you to pony up when the roof needs to be replaced for 15K, the hot water heater breaks and floods the basement, the floors need to be redone due to wear and year, etc.", "It\u2019s very reasonable to say that your bf and you have a different relationship to the house, and thus that splitting the mortgage is unlikely to be \u201cfair\u201d, as you\u2019re paying the same price for different things. \n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s not clear to me that the right number for you to pay is zero, as you\u2019re getting roughly the same thing that a tenant would get (maybe less, as you\u2019re not able to make things your landlord\u2019s problem in the same way as a normal tenant).

Some couples go 50/50, and others use a percentage of income where there is a large income disparity. I am in a similar situation. I owned a house before my partner and I met, we are in our 40s, and my he lives with me. He was renting previously. He pays me a fixed rent that includes utilities and is approximately half our basic housing costs, has a lease agreement detailing what is included and that he has no legal claim to my property, and is legally a tenant. In addition, we split gas and food, and he pays his portion as a secondary driver on my car insurance (I also own our only car). He maintains savings of first and last rent on an average 1 bedroom in our area as an emergency fund in case we break up and he moves out. We both benefit from our housing situation. He is paying money to have a roof over his head, stable housing he knows won't become an Airbnb (that's what happened to his last apartment), and has fixed costs he can budget around. He also pays far less than he would living on his own, so he has more income for other things. I am building equity, but I am also taking on all the financial risk of the housing market going up or down, when costs go up unexpectedly I am on the hook until his rent reevaluation, and when things break I have to pay to fix them like any other landlord. Our dishwasher broke, and while he kindly installed it with me, I paid for it. When the plumbing backed up, I paid to fix it, too. He does not contribute money to capital expenses, renovations, or property maintenance. When he pays me rent, it keeps that money IN OUR FAMILY instead of going to someone else. It allows us to save and have a lifestyle we couldn't afford otherwise. And don't forget that if you break up and move out, you aren't any worse off. In my partner's case, he didn't own a house or a car when we met. And not having them after isn't a reduction in circumstances. If you are in a financial position to invest in real estate on your own and still want to live with your guy, go buy a condo and rent it to become a landlord yourself. That way, you are in the market and can always move there if things go south. On the other hand, if you can't afford to buy, living with him isn't making you any worse off. You are welcome to keep saving for your own down-payment while residing there. But only after paying him. In the case of marriage, equity can also be found. My brother and his wife were in the same situation. Their prenup established his share of her property based on the length of marriage. If they split in the first few years, he got nothing. After 10 years together, he is a full partner on the deed of her house. YTA, btw.", "You need to pay rent whether you live with him or in your own apartment.

There is a whole conversation that needs to take place here. \n\nYou could easily not be the ah by making a reasonable effort to work out a deal that works for both of you.", "Stop trying to be a freeloader. You already pay someone's mortgage when renting - your landlord's! In exchange, you get to not be homeless. You don't own it. You just get to occupy it for a set period of time. That's what renting is. You need to contribute equitably to the cost of housing you are occupying, including if your partner owns it. Some couples go 50/50, and others use a percentage of income where there is a large income disparity. I am in a similar situation. I owned a house before my partner and I met, we are in our 40s, and my he lives with me. He was renting previously. He pays me a fixed rent that includes utilities and is approximately half our basic housing costs, has a lease agreement detailing what is included and that he has no legal claim to my property, and is legally a tenant. In addition, we split gas and food, and he pays his portion as a secondary driver on my car insurance (I also own our only car). If we break up, he will need to move out within 2 months. One requirement I made for him when moving in was that he had to maintain savings of first and last rent on an average 1 bedroom to ensure he could move out if circumstances changed, and he has kept these savings as an emergency fund. We both benefit from our housing situation. He is paying money to have a roof over his head, stable housing he knows won't become an Airbnb (that's what happened to his last apartment), and has fixed costs he can budget around. He also pays far less than he would living on his own, so he has more income for other things. I am building equity, but I am also taking on all the financial risk of the housing market going up or down, I only reassess his rent once a year so when costs skyrocket I am on the hook, and when things break I have to pay to fix them like any other landlord. Our dishwasher broke, and while he kindly installed it with me, I paid for it. When the plumbing backed up, I paid the cost to fix it, too. The best benefit of this is when he pays me rent, it keeps that money IN OUR FAMILY.  It allows us to save and have a lifestyle we couldn't afford otherwise. And don't forget that if you break up and move out, you aren't any worse off. In my partner's case, he didn't own a house or a car when we met. And not having them after isn't a reduction in circumstances. If you are in a financial position to invest in real estate on your own and still want to live with your guy, go buy a condo and rent it to become a landlord yourself. That way, you are in the market and can always move there if things go south. On the other hand, if you can't afford to buy, living with him isn't making you any worse off. You are welcome to keep saving for your own down-payment while residing there. But only after paying him. You may want to buy into his property in the future, and my partner is welcome to do so if, in the future, he has the desire and finances to do so.

He bought a house before we met, and he's just asked me to move in with him. I wanna do it, that for sure, but I'm trying to figure out the terms bcs I don't wanna make the same mistakes I made in my previous relationship \u2014LSS, investing energy, money and time in a house that was HIS and, when we broke up, I had to go back to my parents' place emotionally and financially broke.\n\nSo I've been thinking splitting the expenses on supplies, food or new furniture is 100% the right thing, but not the mortgage. I don't feel confortable paying for a house that is his, because that establishes a landlord-tenant relationship between us (i.e., uneven relationship where one of us is in an advantageous position).\n\nI don't wanna feel that he's got all the control over the roof over my head and, if we split or sth bad happens to him, I'm left with nothing again. If we ever get married or he includes me in his will (sth that will be put on the table in 2/3 years if everything goes well), then I'll for sure pay my part of the mortgage, because then we'll be on the same page towards the house.\n\nAITA for establishing these terms?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yta.", "What I did with my last girlfriend when she moved into my house was look at what her current rent was, what utilities/mortgage was at my house and then set a number for her that saved both of us an equal amount of money. \n\nShe ended up paying roughly half of a what she was paying for her apartment previously, and I was paying 2/3rds of what my costs were before she moved in and we both had an equivalent amount of extra spending money.", "Or instead of 20 percent of the mortgage, she could pay half of the interest, for example. There are tons of ways to make things fair to both parties.", "We haven't talked yet about marriage or eventually adding me to the title of the house, but we definitely should. He just suggested I move in and figure these things out on the go, but I'm not confortable with that. I clearly see I gotta have a conversation with him on this and consider all options \u2014a trial year, a possible rental agreement/contract, future marriage... whatever.", ">It's actually in your best interest to pay him rent. Look up what renting a room in your area goes for and pay him that.\n\nOP might not have as many rights as many states have exceptions to tenant's rights when the landlord (the bf) also lives on the property.\n\nOP should figure out a fair rent payment to her bf. She should be aware that rent is rent and doesn't give her any rights to the property. Don't pay for repairs or improvements, just rent.\n\nYTA.", "NTA since you felt burned before.\n\nHOWEVER, as the poster above stated paying rent for a roof over your head is not unreasonable. But I wouldn't go above and beyond for any house repairs that you would not do as a renter. But also don't get annoyed if the rent money he gets goes towards some house upkeep.", "Perfectly worded and explained, I second this, and YTA.", "Also, with her paying rent, he can't just throw her out. He would have to officially evict her. \n\nShe doesn't realize the advantages she actually has.", "He said we can figure these things out on the go, but I don't feel confortable with that. That's why I'm thinking what would be best so that I can offer him some options and talk it through.", "wtf why would she want to stay there if they break up...", "You realize you said NAH, but then made the argument she is the AH Right? If she wants any protection pay rent.", "Where I'm from you have LESS tenant protection if you live at the same address as your landlord...\n\nSo, I would personally never move in with a partner who out right own the place and pay him rent.... He could kick me out way more easily then a normal landlord... \n\nMy boundary is we own together or we rent together...", "He said we can figure things out on the go, but I don't feel confortable with that. I know that comes from a loving place, but I don't wanna make the same mistakes again. I'll bring up some of the the possible solutions you guys have suggested when I talk to him. Thank you!", "Yes, she needs to pay to stay regardless if it's her bf or not. I def agree with not splitting furniture and pay a decent rent and a portion of the utilities and groceries instead! Because again, you'd have to pay for utilities and groceries for yourself regardless.That splitting furniture costs can get super messy if things end. Also, DEF not help with upgrades as you *are* essentially his tenant", "He has to pay the mortgage either way AND he gets equity from the mortgage too. It's an investment asset.\n\nThe difference is I get protections for my rent, in the form of a tenancy. There are legal requirements to ensure upkeep of the property, right to enjoyment - hell, I got to have a choice in where I lived.\n\nIn this situation, without a legal agreement, one person is saving money on the payments into their investment, while the other person is paying into an investment they don't benefit from long term.\n\nThere's also the intangible things - getting a say in the choice of long term dwelling is just one. Will she get it redecorate? What happens with furniture?  But lastly - I'm not in a romantic relationship with my landlord, and I do not have to live with him, which makes things simpler \n\nMy ex owned and I don't, he said he wouldn't want to charge me rent because the house is his, I had no say in the house and his kids live there 50/50.\n\n There are SO many differences but at the same time this means there are solutions. \n\nNAH!", "Her being there doesn't increase his mortgage payment though? She'd add to bills which she'd then split, but the mortgage isn't a per person rate.", "Yeah that's where in landing. I don't think this is an issue yet until further communication is done. There's a bevy of options here but the key is communication. Do you get a rental agreement? Do you take a reduced market rate? Maybe he doesn't even care and will be happy with whatever.\n\nIf you love the dude, talk to him, express your concerns but be willing to compromise.", "Not paying toward improvement of the house is one thing, but thinking she can just live somewhere for free because she had to pay to live at places previously is entitled nonsense. You live somewhere you don't own, you pay rent to live there. It's simple.", "He lives alone, yes. Anyways, it's ok for me to sign a legal agreement on a reasonable rental payment for a trial year or two and then reconsider things after. What I don't want is to \"figure things out on the go\" while I'm paying for x amount of years for sth I have no legal right on and, if we split or sth happens to him, I'm back to square one.", "Most spouses end up with proportional contributions, eh? Source?", "And adding rent portion to it", "But then she\u2019d be living there for free? I don\u2019t see an issue with him wanting her to contribute rent, because that\u2019s essentially what it would be.", "Right.  She should be paying rent, which is considerably higher.", "What do you think people who rent apartments do? Man, I wish I could be a freeloader...", "Yes split everything and pay the regular rent for the area that she would've paid if she lived in one room apartment alone", "So don't pay for improvements. But everyone has a history of having to pay for where they live. It's called being a fucking adult.", "This is one of the best solutions I\u2019ve read for this situation", "Yeah. The thing is, he's in a great position financially. He owns the house and you aren't on the title. So he can just sit back and keep earning equity. And if you move in and start paying him rent, that's a sweet deal for him because he pays down his mortgage even faster.\n\nThis isn't to say you *shouldn't* move in with him if you two have had a straightforward conversation about this and you have the same goals, but I definitely would be reluctant to just sort of move in with an indefinite \"let's just see how things go\" sort of plan and him being uncomfortable or unwilling to talk about adding you to the title. You paying a small amount during a test year gives a finite time period to it, and also allows you two to see if you work out while living together. If he only wants you as a roommate who pays his mortgage for him and is unwilling to add you to the title and/or make things official... you'd probably be better off to try to save up your money for a down payment on a place of your own that YOU will actually own.", "Because it takes time to save up first/last/security deposit or find an alternate living situation and most people live paycheck to paycheck.  Living with an ex for a while beats being homeless.", "It takes time and money to move. This would give her legal protections if her \"landlord\"/bf decides to break up with her. And if she has her own room, as she would under any other landlord/tenant agreement, she would only need to share the common areas. \n\nMy whole point, though, is mostly sarcastic and pointing out that regular rental agreements aren't equivalent to cohabitating with an SO.", "Yes okay, that's true. You can talk about how much to pay, it doesn't necessarily have to be 50% of the mortgage.", "Then she should decline his request. *He asked her to move in*, and she\u2018d contribute to his goal and could be left with nothing. Then it\u2018s better to live seperately and not create a power dynamic.", ">Then it\u2018s better to live seperately and not create a power dynamic.\n\nIf she moves in and doesnt contribute rent then a different kind of power dynamic will be created.  One where the bf is funding OP's housing and she is a squatter living in his place.", "Again, then it\u2018s better not to live together. He shouldn\u2019t have insisted on it in the first place.", "Well Im sure upon hearing this genius plan from OP, he'd want to rescind his offer.  HE went out on a limb to offer a place to live but she wants to have her cake and eat it too, at boyfriend's expense.", "Insisted on what? I don\u2019t see him insisting on anything here?", "I wish I could be a freeloader and have people come to my defense.", "She already has a place to live and he didn\u2019t have to \"offer\" this. Just look at OP\u2018s past \u2014 do you really want her to take that risk?!", ">\"offer\" \n\nHe offered a place for her to live, to move in with him.  But not for free.  The fact she is posting about this here and asking if she is the AH indicates this is an ongoing disagreement between them.  I dont think the bf is crossing a line by asking for payment.\n\nOP's past is just that, its history.  The BF shouldnt be pressured to accept this bad deal bc of her bad history.  \n\nOtherwise if I were the bf, Id rescind the offer and advise OP she can continue living at her own place.  She has some entitled expectations about living expenses and can keep them to herself."]}
