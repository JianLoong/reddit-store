All your mum had to do was to NOT attempt to wash your clothes, and yet she had to go and do it anyway? Not acceptable.", "NTA", "I think the Millennials are going to agree with OP and anyone of an older generation are going to think OP YTA.   \nMom probably in all likelihood was forced into doing OP laundry because it was piled up and she knew OP would have nothing to wear to school the next day. Part of parental duties include helping their young ones grow up learning how to be productive, self-sufficient, and to take care of business. All through high school I had to buy my own clothes and pay for my own lunches and school fees. I had a full time job during the summer and worked 32 hours/week during school.   \nBuy your own pants, and keep up with your laundry so that your mom doesn't have a reason or desire to keep it under control. Be nice to your parents. They do more for you (for the past 17 years) than you know or will be able to acknowledge until after you've had your own.", "YTA. I think your parents might be struggling more financially than you realise. You have a job and basically no outgoings because you live with your parents rent free. You should be grateful of that and cut your mom some slack.", "YTA. I understand the frustration but as you said your parents can\u2019t afford anything besides the necessary items. You\u2019re mum was probably just trying to do a nice thing for you which had gone wrong. Maybe just explain again how you would like to wash your own clothes but asking them to replace trousers that are 25\u20ac might actually be a big ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
