Directly in front of my seat was a seemingly young drunk girl. She was with her boyfriend or friend. She was rowdy throughout the show and that's okay, a little annoying. She was talking to everyone around her and was very touchy. When the headliner came on she was getting very wild. I started to notice that she was tilting her head all the way back and looking at me (the seats are elevated with each row). I made eye contact once and decided to ignore her. The rows are so tight together that when she tilts her head back, it would basically be between my legs. Even when I brought my legs together, she would smack her head on my shins. She actually turned around for once and apologized after bonking my shins a few times. I waved that it was okay but she then continued to keep tilting her head back and look at me. She then bonked her last bonk and placed her hand on my leg. I leaned forward and yelled, \"Don't you fucking touch me like that, mind my space and stay in yours.\" Her boyfriend turns around and says ,\"Hey man, fuck you.\" I replied, \"No, fuck you. Your girl is touching me, control your bitch.\" She appears to be crying and her boyfriend is trying to comfort her. They end up leaving 5 minutes later.

You could have talked to someone at the venue to kick her out for bothering you even. Your instinct to go nuclear shows you have little to no control over your emotions.", "YTA. Not for your response to the girl, you had every right to yell and be upset at her but because you told a man \u201ccontrol your bitch\u201d which is incredibly misogynistic and goes to show what type of person you are.

What was not okay was her continuing what she had just apologized for and taking it a step further. I admit I did come out pretty heavy, but it had to be said. Her boyfriend was ignoring it, she was too far gone to even realize she was in the wrong. Would have been a bigger scene to get up and get security to take care of it.", "Mind you, he only said that after her boyfriend chimed in. It was an emotionally charged situation and the boyfriend who should her put her in check for her drunken behaviour told OP off for snapping at the drunk girl. \n\nNTA for not wanting to be touched and the fact that you chose to focus on that one little detail says a whole lot about you.", "She's not a dog. The average dog would behave better than that", "He told her to stop touching him. He didn't engage further until the bf chimed in, and he was addressing the bf with his next comment. If someone invades someone else's space, lays hands on them, but can't cope with a \"name\" then there's something wrong.

Because OP definitely sucks.", "Why did you feel the need to say the last part tho", "Ahh I see. That\u2019s def some added context that you should add to the post. It helps paint a clearer picture of what happened. \n\nAnd yea it needed to be said. But you still could have been nicer about it since she was clearly drunk. It\u2019s not like she was being intentionally malicious towards you. Just really inconsiderate. \n\nAnd to assume that the guy was someone in a position to \u201ccontrol\u201d her is also a bit unfair. It could have been a friend, first date, etc. Maybe he didn\u2019t feel like it was his place. I\u2019d cut him some slack and give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, it was HER offending you. Not him.", "He could have said, \u2018can you get her to stop\u2019 rather than \u2018control your bitch\u2019. If he\u2019d called her a bitch directly, I think it would\u2019ve been better than what he said. Also no need to yell at someone for something you haven\u2019t bothered trying to talk to them about first.", "He told the man to \u201ccontrol your bitch\u201d which is sexist language and has a history of violence/ misogyny to it. There\u2019s no excuse for that ever. Just like it wouldn\u2019t be excusable if he used homophobic or racist language.", "Yea, mb", "Bc snapping after repeated assault, that's why.", "No. \"Control your bitch\" did *not* need to be said. For fuck's sake."]}
