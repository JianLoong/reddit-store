You can always simply remove them if he doesn't stop. \n\nI call dibs on the roman artifact keychain, please!", "INFO have you asked him not to do that?", "Side note, this is one of the funnier AITA posts I've seen lately. Adding keychains ... hmmm, okay, that's a bit in the odd side. I don't know if it's an OCD thing, a fetish (for lack of a better word that's not coming to mind), or what. It's definitely .. odd. But, yes, just remove them from your keys accordingly and set them aside -- displayed, in a drawer, whatever.", "NTA. Find a little necklace hanger and put HIS collection of key chains on it for display. Pockets and purses only hold so much.", "Info. Have you talked to him? I mean no is a complete sentence and saying you appreciate it is gratitude. Really simple to use your words", "My guess would be he wants you to think of him when you\u2019re apart, which is pretty sweet.  Have you tried returning the favor?\n\nAs for your keychains, maybe try rotating them out weekly (one at a time), or find another way to display them (on a necklace/chain)?", "NAH. But seriously, you guys need to learn how to communicate!!!! Talk about what you want and don't want, what makes you happy, what annoys you, what idiosyncrasies you each have. It's nothing personal, just communicating so that your relationship gets better.", "\"I am the keymaster!\" \ud83d\ude09 NAH. It's an odd little obsession he has, but ultimately harmless. Why not have fun with it, and find something random of his to start adorning with little love tokens.", "INFO have you actually *spoken* to him about this, and asked him to stop?", "NTA but I don\u2019t really see what the big deal is\u2026", "Why aren\u2019t all your keys on one keychain?

Albeit, in a kind of bizarre way. But you could also just ask him to stop and tell him you\u2019ll put them somewhere you can admire them without having to lug them around.", "INFO: What if anything have you told him about the issue, past or present, and what has he said in response?", "NTA, but tell him \u201cHey, don\u2019t put keychains on my keys, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d", "NTA. He's putting his ownership brand on you. Red flag.", "NTA\n\nBut he thinks he's being sweet, I'd explain to him that you like to keep your keys clean and find some alternate way he can surprise you instead (like making a chain hanging on the wall he can add things to or whatever).", "Not a tracker on one is there lol", "NTA.  What if he bought your pink tennis shoes with polka dots on them?  Would you feel compelled to wear them?  \n\nI, 57F, personally keep only 2 keys on my \"keychain.\" Nothing dangling, nothing sparking... it just isn't me.  I despise having a bunch of keys.  My husband used to put more keys on my \"keychain\" and I hated it.  I took the keys off and left them on the kitchen counter.  Sorry - my belongings and my choice.\n\nI feel that a truly thoughtful gift is one that is good for that person.  Not a gift card, not something \\*I\\* want them to have, etc.  To make a person truly feel appreciated, you gift them what *they* want.  I have a SIL in that gave me and my kids gift cards for 10 years, but the kids and I HATE to shop.  Those cards just accumulated in a box for years.  I finally moved across the country and thankfully she stopped it with any gifts.  Now she sends a card at the beginning of the month.  My birthday is the 15th, I LOVE getting a card on the 3rd of the month. Fantastic fail if she's trying to make me feel appreciated; instead I feel like a stupid check mark on her to-do list.  The exact opposite of what a gift *should* accomplish.", "NTA. Remove the key chains.", "NTA this would bug tf out of me. Communicate that to him.\n\nCongratulations on your new car!", "NTA.  Honestly this sounds like something I would do to playfully annoy my gf.", "Agreed that asking him to stop is the right move, BUT...what's up with him altering your property w/o asking?  Was he raised in a barn?  Don't touch other people's stuff, BF, that's not polite.", "Fair point well made", "Nice idea", "A year ago I explained that IMHO keys are personal and I'd like to just have one or two keychains that I like to avoid jangling, etc. Since then, on receiving one a few months ago I thanked him and said I'd find somewhere for it. He said that would be nice on your bike keys........", "She should put all of them on his key chain. :-)", "I know right. Scrolling through the sub this is definitely a bit left field", "Agreed. Fair shout", "As response to comment below. So basically I skirted around it to avoid hurting his feeling. Will try a more direct approach", "I am confused. Did you actually ask him to stop?", "Sounds like you really need to work on your direct communication skills. You didn't even ask him to stop. How is he supposed to correct his behavior or understand your side if you don't communicate that with him? People forget things. A passive comment you made one year ago may have been forgotten about by now.", "ESH.   It's strange he does that.\n\nI would tell him I don't want extra key chains.

They're bulky & awkward & annoying as hell.\n\neta NTA", "NTA.\n\nKinda weird of your bf.\n\nI mean you could tell him to stop.\n\nAlso, depending on how large the keychains are, you can convert them to earrings or bracelet charms. That's what I do with my funko keychains.", "INFO: Are these Keys he also uses?\n>\nI hate keychains bc women's pants don't have large pockets and they hurt my thigh when I pocket them, but my husband hates *not* having a Keychain because he loses them too easily. If he also uses these keys, make a spare set that are *his* and tell him he can put his keychains on those. \n>\nIf these are *your* keys and yours alone, you need to put your foot down.

Please leave my keys alone.  I don't want to risk losing the gifts you get me because they came off in my pocket. If you see a Keychain you think I would like, give it to me and I'll put it up at work so I can see it and smile when I'm having a hard day.

It seems like he chooses to do this because he wants you to enjoy things he likes, but I bet you once he understands what you like, you\u2019ll be showered in small things that remind him of that.", "NTA.  Just take them off and hang them off of a hook or something.", "NTA. \n\n I don't want to have to search through a bunch of key chains to find the key that I need, but keychains are often a small, cheap souvenir to get from somewhere when I don't like any of the magnets.  So, I have my keychain collection hanging on a pinboard so I can see and appreciate them.  Maybe put something like that together for your keychains?", "NAH but like... y'all need to use your words.", "This is the way", "Definitely not. Not a bunny boiler", "I will give him the benefit of the doubt and believe he is doing it to be nice, not some sort of weird territory marking or hidden trackers, but does he not realize that women have dinky little pockets?  Sometimes I just want to walk around with a credit card and my house/car keys and not carry luggage with me.  His gift is inconvenient and a little intrusive.", "Wish you the best of luck \ud83d\ude0a", "Yip. A more direct response is warranted. There are plenty of nice ideas here on how to enjoy the keychains without carrying them around."]}
