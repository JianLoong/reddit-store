What if he bought your pink tennis shoes with polka dots on them?  Would you feel compelled to wear them?  \n\nI, 57F, personally keep only 2 keys on my \"keychain.\" Nothing dangling, nothing sparking... it just isn't me.  I despise having a bunch of keys.  My husband used to put more keys on my \"keychain\" and I hated it.  I took the keys off and left them on the kitchen counter.  Sorry - my belongings and my choice.\n\nI feel that a truly thoughtful gift is one that is good for that person.  Not a gift card, not something \\*I\\* want them to have, etc.  To make a person truly feel appreciated, you gift them what *they* want.  I have a SIL in that gave me and my kids gift cards for 10 years, but the kids and I HATE to shop.  Those cards just accumulated in a box for years.  I finally moved across the country and thankfully she stopped it with any gifts.  Now she sends a card at the beginning of the month.  My birthday is the 15th, I LOVE getting a card on the 3rd of the month. Fantastic fail if she's trying to make me feel appreciated; instead I feel like a stupid check mark on her to-do list.

Did you actually ask him to stop?", "Sounds like you really need to work on your direct communication skills. You didn't even ask him to stop.
