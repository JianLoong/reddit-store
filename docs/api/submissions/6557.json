She's exploiting your daughter for clout. Your sis is trying to get all the attention on social media but taking on no responsibility in real life. It's like those influencers that post on IG that's they volunteer to feed homeless, but it was just a photoshoot and they did a 30 second charity to help the homeless, it's manipulative and deceitful.\n\nYour baby is not a prop. Your sis needs help if she thinks she's right. Your mom sounds like she wants to keep the peace and often times doesn't speak up and suppresses her emotions. Your dad is cool. And you're a cool cat. Stay awesome possum!", "NTA. Stop letting her be around your kid. She's violating a MAJOR boundary by posting her on social media when you've told her not to. This needs to be addressed in a \"not even close to kidding\" way. Tell her the next time she does it (or the next time you're informed about it if she blocks you from seeing it), you're going to start making public posts about how she's using your baby as a photo prop against your wishes.", "NTA\n\nShe have no right to that especially without your permission. your sister is an asshole here", "NTA\n\nThat she can\u2019t respect you asking her to keep your child off social media is enough. The way she handles your child in social settings with another person is even more ridiculous.\n\nShe\u2019s immature, and you\u2019re right to draw a very firm line.", "NTA\n\nYou gotta set the boundary that pics of your daughter are not what you want on social media.\n\nYou are pretty on the nail that she's using her as an accessory.\n\nI'm an uncle to many (I have 4 siblings) and I'd never post pics of any of them on social media without checking. It's just too inconsiderate of her.", "Nope.  NTA.", "NTA", "Easily NTA. Your sister did not respect the boundaries you set for her. Your sister then chooses to be rude when you enforce your boundaries. Your sister is not entitled to your daughter for clout. Feel comfortable that you are acting in your daughters best interest and ignore all else.", "NTA.  Your baby is not your sister's purse dog, even if that's how she's treating her.", "NTA. You're responsible for deciding which situations your baby can be put in. If you say \"no,\" that should stand. Others can think you're unreasonable, but moms get a broad license to protect kids (esp. very young ones) from anything remotely exploitative.", "NTA OP, your sister is treating your daughter, her niece as nothing more than an object for clout on social media. That's already fucked up, but it's even worse when you told her in no uncertain terms to knock it off and she just keeps on carrying on with it. It's more than reasonable for a parent to not want pictures of their child on social media, and there's plenty of reasons to back it up. But your sister is way too self-absorbed and obsessed with putting this fake persona out there of her being a loving Aunt to her niece to get strangers' validation. And there's another consequence of your sister using your daughter to farm clout and validation. Eventually when your daughter gets older, she's going to see all those pictures and posts her Aunt took of her when she was a baby and then she's going to wonder why she doesn't have any memories of spending time with her Aunt. That's probably going to cause your daughter to think her Aunt doesn't love or care about her and that it is all her fault which only magnifies just how selfish and fucked what your sister is doing really is. Since it's clearly obvious that your sister couldn't give a damn less about your daughter, I'd not let her anywhere near your daughter and maybe even go the petty revenge route and report all those pictures that she took of her and your daughter to get taken down. I wouldn't even call it petty revenge seeing as how you were never comfortable with your sister plastering your daughter all over social media in the beginning and still aren't comfortable with it.\n\nYour Mom is TA in addition to your sister because it's no wonder your sister doesn't give a damn about your boundaries when your Mom is there to try and get you to fold to your sister just to keep the peace. She's more interested in stopping anyone from challenging her daughter's behavior when it comes to indulging in these selfish delusions just so her daughter doesn't throw a bratty temper tantrum that disturbs your Mom's peace of mind. Good on your Dad for putting your sister in her place, thank goodness there's at least one selfless rational minded person in your family besides yourself OP.", "NTA I never like to see parents using their kids for social media likes. I think the way you feel is spot on valid. It isn\u2019t like she is sharing posts because she actually is enjoying your child\u2019s company, but as a way to get attention for herself.", "NTA - parents decide what gets posted on social media of their kids.", "Definitely NTA. She handled your daughter like a dog. Don't feel bad for making sure you're daughter is more than just an accessory for your sister's social media scheme. Tbh if I were in your shoes I won't let her near the toddler for the time being.", "NTA, and you're exactly right.  Your sister is using her for her IG posts and as an accessory.\n\n\"My mother says I should have just stayed quiet to not cause conflict between us\"\n\nNah, your sister caused conflict by mishandling the baby when she was done with her", "NTA\n\nOnly thing that matters is that little girl and her safety. Random uncontrolled pictures? Awkward at best. Sitting her on some unknown persons (especially male) lap? Potentially outright dangerous. I'm not saying that guy in particular is a threat but you literally have no way of knowing and it should be avoided.\n\nI'd say tell your sister to get a puppy if she wanted something to post pictures of on social media, but I don't really want her ignoring a puppy until it's convenient either. Buy her a plant?", "NTA\n\nBut I would insist on all photos being removed from social media.", "Kids are not accessories.  They are actual human beings with actual feelings and actual thoughts.\n\nNTA by a mile.", "Definitely not the asshole. Sister's just an attention seeker with 0 respect, especially if she kept doing this after telling you she's gonna stop. Keep the distance and give her some time to get her priorities straight.", "NTA", "NTA...You have the right to not have your daughter's image splashed on social media. Your sister is out of line and your mother is enabling her.", "NTA. Also WTF? It doesn't matter if you're her sister. Anyone messing with your kids has crossed a line.\n\nThen going on to post it on social media is like... f- right off. That's well over the line. If she's gonna do that when your daughter's a baby, what's she going to do when your daughter is older? I'd be thinking along the lines of 'Okay, I didn't like that - if you do this again, I'm not going to have you around my daughter for a few months.' And escalate from there.\n\nIt's clear asshole behaviour on your sister's part. I don't know anyone who'd consider that sort of thing even borderline acceptable.\n\nKeeping the peace is fine and all, but dishonest peace is sometimes worse than the consequences of an honest conflict. Peace is not innately more desirable than conflict.", "I cannot respond to all comments but thank you so much for the feedback, I felt like I was going insane. My daughter isn\u2019t anywhere on social media besides my sisters accounts because I personally don\u2019t want my daughter out there at such a young age. Even in family pictures that we had for Christmas cards and such I made sure her face wasn\u2019t visible when I was holding her because I don\u2019t want my daughters face out there especially for my ex and his family to see who want nothing to do with her. Most I\u2019ve done is announce her birth so my extended family knows that there\u2019s a new family member, if anyone wants to see my daughter what they can do is either drop for a visit or video call. There\u2019s weird people out there and I\u2019ve seen how creepy strangers can be in comments on other children\u2019s photos/videos and I don\u2019t want to risk putting my daughter in danger. I am a very private person when it comes to her and I wonder if there is any legal action I can take against my sister. I know it sounds terrible to do this to a family member but she absolutely refuses to stop posting my daughter on social media especially when her profiles are open to the public. Instagram, Facebook, etc one click on her profile and you can see my daughter there. On her longer Facebook posts she tends to detail what my daughter has done throughout the day and on one instance even took a picture of my daughters daycare. I don\u2019t want that out there.", "NTA, I think the obvious thing to do here is not to ASK her to stop but to put your foot down and say: you can no longer take pictures of my daughter and share them to anyone or put them on social media, ever.", "NTA. It kind of sounds like your mom agrees with you so tell her to take a harder stance because this is her grandchild too", "NTA your sister is treating your daughter like a designer handbag \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f get her told.", "Babies can't consent to their online presence.
