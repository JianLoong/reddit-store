I understand the discomfort, but funerals aren't exactly about having the best possible time. \n\nSit in seats further back, avert your eyes, and sit with your discomfort. \n\nYou liked your FIL, do him the respect of going to his funeral. Presumably you don't hate your MIL, do her the respect and support of attending her husband's farewell. That outweighs a little discomfort.\n\nI also think it's very strange that you included that your wife will not follow her mother's burial wishes. That's weird and also irrelevant to this particular story.\n\nAnwyay, I think you'd be a slight YTA if you don't go.", "YTA. Also you guys would definitely be AH if you don\u2019t do her own death wishes when she dies.", "Is this your wife\u2019s father?   What kind of emotions does your wife have about her father\u2019s passing?\n\nThis should not be a question for you.   You should be doing *whatever* your wife wants.   If she wants to go to the funeral, you go and hold her hand.  If she wants to stay home and cry, you stay home and hold her hand.   You don\u2019t make this more complicated for her by digging in your heels and making this about *your* feelings.

So, she should respect your wishes now, but you won\u2019t respect hers later? \n\nYour MIL\u2019s anger is the only emotion you mention, not her grief at losing her life partner.

If you do care about her, go and sit in the back and suck it up like everyone else. I say this as someone who is also super freaked out by the dead.", "YTA. It's odd to prime the reader with how \"traditional\" and \"republican\" your MIL is. Not sure that is necessarily.

Pretty big issue, there.\n\nPlus, you know it would cause tension with your MIL. Skipping a funeral is a much bigger deal than wrapping a Christmas present in birthday paper, and is going to result in family tension that never goes away.

I don't want the last memory to be of his body\" and tell her you will come to the funeral home, but you won't go in and see the body. But honestly you most likely need some therapy over this bc you have never been to a funeral and you are worried about that being the image in your mind. Most of the time, it doesn't work that way.  Yes you see the body and they usually are well done, but it's not the image that's burned in your mind as the last memory of them.

The funeral isn\u2019t about the dead, it\u2019s about supporting and loving their survivors. This is not about you. Suck it up. Be there for your wife and your MIL\u2014and see a therapist. This is an extreme reaction to seeing a body under non traumatic circumstances, and you should figure out why it freaks you out so much, because there are going to be other funerals in your future and you need to be able to be there. \n\nMy BIL considered not coming to my grandmother\u2019s funeral this summer, and it broke my heart. My mother explained how important it was for her and the rest of the family that he came, and he luckily changed his mind and attended.

I get it. I cannot stand open caskets. I refused to look at my dad after he passed and we didn\u2019t do an open casket. But the funeral home did a viewing for the family. I didn\u2019t look. I kept my head down or looked to the side. But to not attend for that reason would have been devastating for my family. My children also did not go look. My husband did. My mom sat with him for hours. Everyone has their own comfort level. But you need to attend. I won\u2019t give you a judgement because I know this situation is awful. But your family needs you right now. \n\nAnd believe me, I know what you mean. My gma mailed me pics of my great gma in her casket. I was TEN. It was exceptionally traumatizing for me. But I still will always support those I love in a time of grief and pain.", "NAH here I guess though I personally would suck it up to be there for my MIL. Fully expect her to be hurt. I would be if my SIL didn't come to my husband's funeral. I get not wanting that to be the last views.

Or don't have a service when that's what she wants. That would be pretty disrespectful", "YTA, sorry to say. Not a huge one, but an A still. Funerals are for the living, not the dead, and your MIL is a part of your family and she obviously wants and need your support. You don't even need to get close to the coffin if you don't want to.

I tried to think about him when he was alive and smiling or the times we got into stupid arguments but all I could see was his stiff body laying there, gone. I know people are saying y t a because you should be there to support your wife but I really don\u2019t think they get it. If you do go, even if you don\u2019t, you should go to therapy.

I recommend you go with the \u201cI have to work\u201d story, however, because it sounds like MIL won\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve been to only one funeral. It was for my 18 year old brother. It was open casket. It wasn\u2019t gross (it wouldn\u2019t have been open casket) but I have never gone to another. The funeral was ghastly and depressing. I don\u2019t cry in front of other people, so there I was at my brother\u2019s funeral, standing in a line with members of the family who had come for it, and they are all crying and I\u2019m there dry-eyed feeling like I am made of stone. It\u2019s like you are supposed to grieve in public. I have to remember him like that (and it\u2019s been 40 years). (There are a bunch of other things from that week that caused me additional trauma. It was all bad.) He\u2019s the only one of us who is buried (he hated that dad was cremated and not buried). I have only been to memorial services since then. When my grandma died, we had a small memorial party at mom\u2019s house and invited a small group of people who knew her. I did the same after my mom died. Like mom and grandma, I am going to be cremated and anyone left can have a memorial party or not; I won\u2019t be there so I won\u2019t care. But I hope they don\u2019t want an actual funeral.", "NTA, You have the right to avoid situations that have already been, and you know will further be, traumatic to you.

I totally get you: I didn't attend both my grandparents' funeral for the very same reasons you state, and I loved them to pieces. When I was 15, I was literally dragged to attend an uncle's (mom's brother) funeral and was literally forced to stand by the casket and have a last look at my uncle. It revolted me, and it still does to this date. I really don't get why people still think it's ok to exhibit a corpse like this; not only is it creepy, it's in poor taste and completely useless. I don't think it actually does a thing for anyone. I feel for your wife, though.", "NTA I volunteered at a morgue for a couple years and can openly say corpses are creepy af,  especially if you're not used to being around them.
