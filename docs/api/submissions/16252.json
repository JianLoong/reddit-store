My research focus on maternity, law and society. More recently I have been diving deeper into how one of the repercussions of the child free movement is the segregation of mothers. My family obviously knows what I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister (26F) is getting married and is choosing to do a child free wedding. Fine enough. She announced her choice to family a few weeks ago. I said nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis weekend we and a few cousins/close family members went out to brunch. My sister out of the blue asks what are my thoughts about her child free wedding. I said it was not the moment nor place to talk about it, it\u2019s her wedding, my studies are from a much broader point of view, not from an individual perspective. She insists, says she won\u2019t be upset and now a few of the others want to hear what I have to say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay then. So I explain that from my research I have found that community events (like birthdays, weddings) that are child free have a bigger impact on mothers. How child free events often put the burden on the mother, the ones expected to care for children, to stay away from them, excluding not just children but women from participating in the social life of the community they are part of. How this idea of having a day that\u2019s all yours, expecting your community to celebrate/support you while excluding important members of any community (children) come from individualist world view while maintaining your expectations over your community. I did highlight again that my studies are NOT focused on one individual but the societal impacts from a changing dynamic in communities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was more articulated than this since I didn\u2019t have a word limit and answered a few questions that arose. My sister was quiet after that and as soon as I noticed I changed the subject and everyone moved on to other topics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, yesterday my sister called me to tell me I was very rude to say I what I said and that she is upset with me. I have been thinking about it and I\u2019m conflicted. I knew it could cause problems and that\u2019s why I refused to answer the first time but she did insist and said it would be fine.

In what way does that lessen the caring burden on women? Because it\u2019s always majority of women who will be the ones to take the screaming kid out of the church or have to go back to put the kids to bed while dad (speaking in hetero terms) is happily getting drunk, ignoring his kids partying. Seems to me the issues are greater than just a case of \u2018child free weddings/events place burden on women\u2019 when really it\u2019s \u2018having children = burden always majority on women from physical damages of pregnancy and childbirth to career stalling to everything is all mum\u2019s fault/responsibility\u2019", "NTA.

If the is her choice then she has to stand by it.", "NTA, your sister asked your thoughts and you told her. She should not have asked if she couldn't handle the answer, smh. It was actually rude of her to insist you answer her question when you didn't want to, in the first place.", "NTA. She asked \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and even gave you reassurances to be honest. Frankly, I think what you have to say is really important.", "NTA, and that's coming from someone who's wedding is also gonna be child free. \n\nShe asked for your opinion based on your research focus, you gave her those results", "This sounds like a societal debate question.

Don't fall for it.", "NTA.\n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m child free by choice, chose to invite kids to my wedding, and also support my friends and family members who choose to not invite children to their weddings. Your wedding, your choice.\n\nFirstly, and I think more importantly, _she asked._ If she didn\u2019t want your opinion, she shouldn\u2019t have asked. You didn\u2019t offer it unsolicited.\n\nSecondly, while I\u2019m not an expert myself, your broad themes and conclusions make total sense. I can absolutely see how that would happen. If the family unit cannot find childcare, I would guess the onus would be on the mother in many cases to stay home. Not limited to weddings but I\u2019ve seen this happen in one friend group, and it really sucked for the mom in question. She was lonely, isolated, and doing an unfair share of parenting. If a couple can find childcare for a child free wedding or other occasion, I\u2019d wager that in a good many relationships, the mother is taking on the emotional labor and legwork to make it happen.\n\nI\u2019m pretty individualistic myself (both by virtue of being American and also by core personality), so I honestly care less about the community aspect than perhaps I should. But your position clearly not only has merit but also has support garnered from a body of social science research. I wouldn\u2019t just dismiss it as unimportant or untrue. Certainly it wasn\u2019t rude for you to share it.", "NTA if she really asked for your opinion.    \nIf you offered it unsolicited, YTA.", "NTA - I'm not sure what she expected, unless it was to validate her having a child free wedding. It's weird that she would ask and reassure you she won't be upset and then call you rude. You not only warned her, but gave her the information in a very professional manner. I wouldn't have been upset if it were me. I would probably go ahead with my child free wedding, but it would give me food for thought. Also, thank you! I appreciate this input on the societal aspect of child free events. It's an angle I had never thought of before and it's interesting.", "NTA . You did try and not discuss it and that\u2019s all you could have done.", "NTA. She knows what you do for a living and your thoughts. She knew your opinion. And she asked for it anyway. You declined to answer. She asked again and so you answered. She then got upset with your answer. You are NTA.", "NTA. She knows what you study and pushed for your opinion knowing that she could be offended. She brought this upon herself and needs to deal with the consequences. \n\nTell her that your sorry she got offended but this is why you didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nA common thing in my country is that children are allowed to attend weddings until a certain hour, than it\u2019s no kids allowed. Might be a good suggestion", "A clear case of: if you may not like the answer, don't ask the question.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I'm not sure what your sister was expecting. To give her the benefit of the doubt though I think she was asking for a more interpersonal view on her wedding, you know, in relation to her as an \"individual\" as you put it. I doubt she can find a way to properly articulate that and is just mad in general because of it.\n It's just that due to your profession, I don't think you *can* have a view from an individualistic stance besides of how much you research the topic on a grand scale.\n\nPersonallly I disagree on your broad negative view on childfree weddings. You're view is very traditional in regards to \"children SHOULD attend important events!\" Because mothers are put at a burden. While yes, that in itself is true, there are so many other facets of society that PREFER women with children over those who are childfree, there are so many events that are primarily focused on children that it's genuinely difficult to find ceremonies or events that are primarily focused on adults.\n\nI agree that mothers get burdened whenever there is a childfree event or ceremony, but that's purely on them for becoming a mother. It's one of their responsibilities *as a mother* to navigate spaces where their children are welcome, and guess what? This world is the most child friendly it has ever been and to some people it's frustrating.\n\nI want a child free wedding, I want to mainly make relationships with people who are also childfree because I've been parentified enough, I want to be able to organize child free events without getting backlash from parents that already have thousands of events available to them.\n\nThank you for doing research on maternity, the world will always need people like you. But please understand that childfree events need to happen to give some people, even mothers, a break from catering their existence to children who may be in the vicinity. \n\nA childfree wedding helps a mother have just a moment where they can attempt to escape that title.\n\n\nI'm saying all this knowing that there is a high chance your sister isn't childfree personally and it might just be her wanting the day to herself. (Which she deserves! You only get married once! Well, hopefully) In the broad scheme of things you're not an asshole, and the only reason this isn't NAH is that your sister is hostile about your response. I think despite that you might want to apologize for not having an individualistic opinion, your profession makes it hard to, but you of course have nothing to apologize for your opinion on childfree weddings in general. :) \n\n(It was nice gathering my thoughts on this, didn't expect to type this much lmao)", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t ask questions you know and don\u2019t like the answer to. She should KNOW this is your position, I doubt it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s heard it, or that she\u2019s so uneducated that this didn\u2019t make sense to hear it if it was the first time. \n\n  \nYou tried to get out of it, she insisted, she get\u2019s to hear it in stereo.", "NTA\n\nShe asked.  You tried to demur. She pressed the matter and even said she wouldn't be upset. You answered with academic rigor, which I have to assume she expected given your area of expertise and her insistence on getting your opinion.", "I get the feeling there is no sister and you just want to broadcast your feelings on child free weddings \n\nOh NTA though", "NTA. \n\nShe asked, you answered. You made it clear that your research focuses on macro-level social effects rather than individuals' decisions, and you made it clear that you had no opinion about her wedding specifically.", "NTA. People shouldn\u2019t ask questions if they are possibly going to receive answers they won\u2019t like.", "If you were **more** articulate than you are here, I can understand why YTA. Casual family brunch and you gave your dissertation. Time and place for things, the time and place dictated instead of a explanation of research and individualist world view to just say \"child free usually means a mom can't attend, I would reconsider.\"", "NTA. She asked and you attempted to defer the conversation to another time and place. You also qualifed the scope of your research. She insisted that now was fine and that no feelings would be hurt. That she ended up hurt by what you said when you gave you view is not your fault.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like she took a bolt of whole cloth and claimed it was a garment tailored to fit. You were giving your findings on the general societal impacts of the topic based on years of research. Not spouting off on how her child-free wedding would be unfair to this cousin or that in-law.\n\nIf she's taking those broad views as an attack on her, maybe she needs to stop and consider why she feels it was an attack on her.\n\nAs an off the cuff guess from the peanut gallery, I'd wonder if maybe she was feeling conflicted and wanted you to tell her that they're a good thing. When you didn't, it might have amplified that sense of personal conflict.\n\nside-note, personally, I've never been much for the idea of child free weddings, but more from a viewpoint as to what I see the typical reasons people use for having one say about changes in what society values. The impacts you see just add more reasons to be unfond of them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for being honest in a situation that was challenging. Your sister may be feeling some guilt and taking it out on you; hopefully she feels different after processing it.

I\u2019ve also observed this in the wild.\n\nBasically what you\u2019re describing is one major reason I personally have chosen to be child free.", "It\u2019s not exactly that events with children are less of a burden on mothers and more that while still a burden it allows for social interaction and partaking in the community. \n\nI cannot talk from an American culture perspective but events with children in my country generally bring more support for mothers (in the \u201cit takes a village\u201d kind of idea) inside those events (be in the form of other mothers, older members of the community or paid care from the hosts). \n\nBut yes, you are correct in pointing out that this is just one facet of the discourse on Care Work and Women.", "I wasn\u2019t there for the conversation, but I have to think that maybe the reason why sister got offended is because short quips while out with friends about the research are not going to convey the nuance that often comes hand in hand with academic research. Presuming that OP is a responsible researcher, she presumably is not just researching whether the childfree movement alone is further leading to the segregation of mothers. I would think that she would also be researching whether or not this is a self perpetuating cycle. I know lots of childfree women who will bluntly say that they would be more interested in having children if they could be dads. Many people embraced being childfree because of the additional responsibilities that are societally placed on mothers, even when the father is very present or a SAHD. So is OP examining whether the child free movement is the one that is truly doing this to mothers? Or is it just a combination of an already patriarchal society, and a shift to a more permissive and hands-on form of parenthood? I\u2019ve seen child free weddings more frequently not because people are anti-children, but because the more permissive forms of parenting have led to children being permitted to run amok or make noise at inappropriate times, and neither parent does anything to reign them in.\n\nI would assume that if OP is a responsible researcher, she is looking for other indicators that there actually is a causal effect, and that this isn\u2019t segregating that would be happening naturally anyway, due to current societal expectations. But you\u2019re not going to get into that nuance over brunch.", "> If the family unit cannot find childcare, I would guess the onus would be on the mother in many cases to stay home. \n\nDon't you think the parent that's less invested in the couple getting married would stay home?", "And the fathers still exist to \u201ehelp\u201c.", "Oh, I wish! One less mad sister. But I already have my classrooms to broadcast my thoughts on child free events (I teach specifically in Motherhood and Law).", "I don\u2019t see it that way.

The OP needed to qualify a conclusion with context and nuance in order to mitigate that.", "Ok, thank you. It\u2019s valid feedback, I can be very professorial even if it\u2019s unintentional.", "Same! Eschewing wanting/desiring or having kids lessens a bunch of patriarchal shackles (though there\u2019s many still on us). I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t wanted kids (heard enough of the brutal truth from friends even in the most equal of relationships).", "OP, you studied from your culture perspective and culture. My culture look much like yours in this point. Everyone helps with the children and the children entertain themselves with the other children.I was in a ton of family events with children and It isn't a big deal. I usualy saw drunk adults doing more mess and scandal than children. Also, the parents can decide what is best for them: take the children or let them at home.", "Where are u from?.", "OOOOH. These are also really interesting questions. And now I wish we could just pick OP\u2019s brain.", "Possibly, hence the \u201cin many cases.\u201d", "We love the patriarchy and how 90% of fathers know nothing about managing a household because \"that's what mothers do!\" \n\nChildfree weddings give fathers an average weekend out with their friends. \n\nA childfree wedding to an exhausted mother? Might be a night to breath in and out for once. Or the bane of their existence because they can't imagine existing without their children anymore cause of societal views.", "I want to take that course!

Sure, confirmation that shes right she would love but I doubt she would've been pissed if someone gave a negative vote.\n\nI could be wrong.", "Personally, that\u2019s the problem I have with what you said. You weren\u2019t stating YOUR opinion, you were stating your RESEARCH. She didn\u2019t ask about what your research was on childfree weddings, she asked for your opinion/feelings about her wedding. Instead you gave her a dissertation.", "No kidding! Because I would also want to ask the question about whether mothers are truly being segregated any differently than they were before hand, or is it possibly just a shifting of the scales? For many many many hundreds of years being a mother was the default, while being childless made you an anomaly at best. At worst a social pariah. We have many words for single childless women that are not very pleasant. Only recently in time have childfree women been encouraged to embrace the fact that they are not married, are not mothers, and are being encouraged to live a life that they want rather than bend societal pressure to become a mother if they don\u2019t want to be. \n\nSometimes this can lead to too sharp a divide, like some of the comments you see in r/childfree, but often times some of the segregation that happens it\u2019s just what happens naturally from people that are in different stages of their life. Many childfree people lament losing their friends to motherhood and feeling like they have nothing to talk with them about anymore because they are consumed with their children, while the mothers also look to their childfree friends as being too flighty and not understanding that their children can\u2019t always go with the babysitter when they want to hang out. It is pretty common for people to drift away from each other when their interests and places in life no longer align.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that this is an interesting topic for OP to be researching and have dived into. But I also wonder how much of this is blaming a demographic of women for keeping other women down when maybe it\u2019s been the patriarchy all along.", "My point is that boiling a position statement down to a sound byte doesn\u2019t give anywhere close to a representative or nuanced picture of that position.", "I don\u2019t have language that is precise enough to articulate what I mean, but I\u2019m going to try: I\u2019ve wondered as well if there\u2019s much, much more to OP\u2019s research than just this facet, or if there\u2019s a confounding variable of misogyny among women and the effects that aren\u2019t being captured.\n\nMultiple things can be true at once, and I don\u2019t doubt that child free events do segregate mothers. That is highly likely to be one effect experienced by women out there. But to your point also, misogyny does cut both ways, both from society in general and from other women. I\u2019m really curious about the breadth of OP\u2019s studies now.", "Agreed. But a nuance picture is not required at all times is my point. Sometimes your just being chill.", "Absolutely. Definitely things like childfree weddings can segregate mothers. But I also am curious about scope and degree. As an example\u2014a major initiative many companies have tried to make over the years are \u201cwomen\u2019s initiatives\u201d, \u201cwomen\u2019s groups\u201d and other mentorship and collaboration opportunities. A near universal comment I hear from childfree women about these groups is that despite best intentions to be \u201cone size fits all\u201d, they routinely devolve into \u201cmom groups\u201d and focus on the challenges of being a working mother because the majority of professional women are mothers. Childfree and infertile women often feel like they can\u2019t talk about the challenges they have because they aren\u2019t as important as children. \n\nWhich goes back to my thoughts that if OP is a responsible researcher, her opinions one would hope are more nuanced than the fluff notes she gave her sister.", "I still don\u2019t see it that same way; I think even an additional couple of sentences that qualify a statement are never a bad thing. FWIW, I read \u201cmore articulate\u201d as the OP stated things more clearly, not necessarily at greater length, if that helps.", "No worries. I was just explaining my point of you. I understand yours.", "Not all opinions are equal. The idea that mothers are discriminated against and not privileged, from getting better shifts and days off at work to free stuff and free labor to people saying not wanting to worry about others' kids at their own event is mean, imo doesn't deserve any more respect than believing the world is flat. I would call a flat earther the AH for having such opinions even when pressed to describe them, so I'm voting YTA because... you putting the burden of entertaining others' kids on people throwing their own event is absurd.", "NAH while I understand that she asked for your opinion it's definitely a bit much that it's considered harmful to women when adults make rules about their events that don't include children. It seems as though there was a pre-determined statement you were going to make and you probably should have declined to continue that line of questioning.", "I tend to think that kids under school age shouldn't go to formal events.  They don't understand what's going on, they can't sit still and be quiet, and they would be far happier at home taking their meals and naps and bedtime on schedule.  And for several years after that, I'd take it on a case by case basis;  I've known some kids who could handle three hours of funeral as well as the adults were, and some who start wiggling after ten minutes.  Some kids can wait to eat if they get a couple pieces of candy in the interim. Some melt down  if they don't eat familar food on time.  None of the kids are wrong. But their needs may not be compatible with a formal event, and it's on the parents to recognize this. \n\nAnd people have to negotiate this with their family members.  If your sister is \"my family always comes with\", then you either need to plan your wedding to accommodate her family or you need to accept that your sister won't come.  It's the same sort of thing in my mind as my accommodation of my future mother in law's balance and knee issues. I want her there to see her only son get married; therefore, I'm planning around her issues.  If I just wanted a storybook wedding in an outdoor venue, and to hell with whether or not everyone could walk up the trail, I could do that, but it would be hypocritical of me to then be upset because most of the people we want to have come are in their late seventies and eighties and can't do that.", ">She insists, says she won\u2019t be upset and now a few of the others want to hear what I have to say.\n\nWell...she lied.", "NTA and I really love your field of study, interesting and important work.", "NTA, she pushed you to tell her what you thought of her wanting a child free wedding, she can't be upset when you told her.", "NTA. She was aware of your research focus and asked anyway. I find it hard to believe she didn't expect this response. I almost wonder if she was hoping you'd lie be\u2078]cause she was already hearing from people about it and wanted to use you to back her up.\n\nI do think that it might have been helpful to offer potential solutions that allow her to meet her goal of having adult time while not isolating mothers. For example, in my area, it's possible to hire vetted childcare providers to more or less set up a temporary daycare if parents RSVP for their kids so you have a headcount before the event", "\"segregation of mothers\" sounds like bullshit and I'm skeptical any of this is real.", "NTA she pressured you and didn\u2019t like what the truth was", "I was the dad who carried the screaming child out of the church.", "Just because you do doesn\u2019t mean this is the norm. So many studies back this up when it comes to division of labor in households, not to mention things like the mental load.", "Omg! I love that tbh that kids get to see aunt carol get messy drunk and laugh at everything \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nThis situation is the exact reason why the \"surprised Pikachu face\" meme exists.", "NTA - She doesn\u2019t get to demand you spill the beans and then get offended by the beans.", "NTA. And what interesting research; I totally agree. I hate the \u201cchild free\u201d trend for everything and the way it isolated moms and families.", "NTA you aren\u2019t wrong.", "I would imagine this is precisely why OP stated that they can't give an opinion on individual cases because there are too many other variables to consider. As a generalisation, OPs comments are fair and reasonable, but all generalisations are dangerous, including this one", "Yeah one great thing with big community events with weddings is that even if you don't want them just running around the whole time, it's much easier to set up one place where children will be with several people paid to look after them. Efficiency of scale is a huge deal and it also means that kids can attend for a little bit but go back to the kids' area if it gets boring or overwhelming. They can have a whiteboard up with names and just move a magnet when the kid leaves the room for the party and move it back when they return so they even know where the children are and who should be watching them!", "She asked, she found out. Now she's feeling guilty and wants to displace that into anger at you.\n\nYou are NTA and I hope she rethinks her wedding decisions, for all the reasons you outline.", "NTA \n\nShe asked. You answered. And you were even considering her feelings while she wasn't considering yours.", "NTA\n\nShe asked what you thought.  you suggested this wasn't the time or place.  She insisted.", "Just as a mother myself, while I personally love the childfree events for grown-up time, I would actually appreciate the chance to choose for myself. We just had to cancel going to one of hubby's mates' weddings because all our babysitters were out of action (moved, sick, attending, or already had plans) and hubby refused to attend without me (something about us being a package deal).\n\nAll that said, NTA OP, she asked, you said \"wrong time and place\",  she and other guests insisted, you answered, she decided she didn't like what she heard after you warned her. This is a her problem and not your problem.", "Good point. One of many reasons why I am childfree myself!", "no one said it wasn't though?", "...and what's your point exactly? This isn't what this post is discussing.", "Obviously not African I see", "She asked, you even checked if she was really sure she wanted you to answer honestly\u2026 NTA and also your research sounds really interesting/like the kind of thing some of my friends and I would absolutely have fun debating about.", "Ok, so first off.... NTA\n\nAnd.... this is probably one of the most articulate and interesting posts (and responses) that I've read on Reddit (i'm still fairly new). Your research sounds fascinating. As for your sister, she insisted on your answer, and now is upset with you? That unfortunately is on her, cause I'm pretty sure she knew what your stance would be.", "It seems your sister made a plan to set you up and it was wildly successful.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You told her it wasn\u2019t directed at her personally nor was it the time or place to discuss such things and she proceeded to bug you about it. She asked, you answered. It is not your fault she did not like the answer. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NAH I think she isn\u2019t either given she didn\u2019t attack you, it\u2019s understandable she would feel a ways about her choice given this info. If she blames you for it going forward I\u2019d say n t a because she would be moving into AH territory. I hope you\u2019re compassionate to her and she gets past the feelings. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s true in some societies, I\u2019d presume in yours childcare is available for those affected. She can prepare for those who can\u2019t attend due to childcare, maybe have a trusted babysitter available that those guests can cover the cost of together (for example, if she can\u2019t afford a babysitter for the day as part of the wedding budget). This way she can ease her conscience and allow those she cares about to attend her big day.", "She asked, then she pushed for an answer when you initially declined. If she isn't open to any answer you might give, she shouldn't ask the question. NTA.", "NTA. It's amusing when people push you or anyone else for their actual thoughts on an issue after you politely decline aka take the hint and then get upset when you have a valid but different view from them.", "I was recently at an event in a reception hall, only the women's bathroom had a changing station....i think you are onto something. An interesting project could be the proportion of public places with changing stations in both gendered bathrooms and how that impacts societal roles in child care", "I'd love to think so. And then I read a post here how a male friend (the dad) asked his female friend (just a friend not a relative) to wipe his kids ass cause he'd rather not. So never assume with reason and logic lol"]}
