If you're husband is also not sure it's a good idea then it sounds like you both are on the same page. \n\nI would say no to the daughter coming. Your husband sounds like he understands your feelings on the matter.", "NTA, she clearly just wants a free holiday to Hawaii. \n\nThankfully, it seems your husband is on the same page as you and isn't forcing you to take her.", "NTA - So this girl refuses to engage with you at all even as her dad\u2019s wife but she wants to go on your birthday vacation? Yeah that\u2019s a hard lesson for the daughter, treat people the way you want to be treated. If she wants to be included on your vacations like she\u2019s family then she should have treated you like family. \n\nNow she is a kid and they do make mistakes that could sometimes be forgiven. So I\u2019d say if she makes an effort going forward to develop a relationship with you then maybe on your 35th birthday vacation you can invite her. But for this vacation? No, it would be so awkward for you both and your not get to enjoy your birthday which was the point of the vacation.", "NTA she's a complete stranger to you through her own actions and just wants a free holiday.", "Nope. NTA. But your husband should step up and draw this line himself rather than make you the bad guy.", "NTA. She isn't looking to meet you, she just wants an amazing vacation. And I wouldn't be surprised if she monopolized his time, whether on purpose or just because she rarely sees him living in another country. \n\nShe had plenty of chances to get to know you, and will have plenty more in the future. Your birthday isn't the right time.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday so you WNBTA even if you did have a relationship with her but just wanted to make it a couples trip because it\u2019s *your* birthday and presumably *you\u2019re* paying for it. \n\nNot having a relationship with her makes this cut and dry. She doesn\u2019t get to selectively have you around when it benefits her. Also, there\u2019s a very real chance from your perspective that she may take this opportunity to sabotage your birthday trip as she os obviously hostile to your presence in her father\u2019s life. \n\nThat said, handle it sensitively because this might be the way in for you to improve your relationship. You could offer to take her on another less expensive trip if you can afford it, or similar. Turn it into an opportunity to bond further rather than a rejection, where possible. And if she\u2019s still resistant then you have your answer about how this trip would have turned out anyways.\n\nEdit: also it feels like it\u2019s very much your husband\u2019s job to do the emotional labour here and resolve these tensions not yours. Is she resentful of you because of a lack of attention from him? It\u2019s not fair of him to expect you to leave the room when he FaceTimes her either. Husband needs to do the work to make this transition easier.", "NTA. \n\n1. You both deserve a romantic getaway, every married couple does. Keeps the passion alive and gives you time to focus on eachother.\n\n2. She didn\u2019t make active steps to get to know you.\n\n3. You said this is you taking your husband on a trip? Then you dictate who goes and doesn\u2019t.\n\n4. You\u2019re handling all this very reasonably. So not an asshole.\n\n5. If the daughter wanted to go out to dinner or lunch to discuss why she was so distant all this time, I could understand. Or if you want to extend that invitation, cool. Teenagers aren\u2019t the most emotionally mature.\n\nThat\u2019s your call if you want to extend that invite but it\u2019s not really your responsibility to do so.", "NTA. Daughter wants Hawaii, not a healthy relationship nor to spend time with you. Not sure if you would be the asshole if she genuinely wanted to improve her relationship with you through the trip anyways as this vacation is about your husbands birthday. If he wanted her to go, it might be a different story, but he seems to think she'll be there to cause mischief.", "NTA, the ex-wife and her daughter have continuously ignored OP\u2019s existence throughout. Even now, after OP voiced her refusal for the daughter to join vacation, guess who they made the complaint? They complaint to the husband instead via email.  If they treat as if OP is dead then there is no reason to have a relationship with the daughter much less a birthday vacation together.", "NTA. Vacations can be very stressful times with a family that know each other so to have this new teenager suddenly join you is not a good idea.\n\nMy step daughter hates me as I treat her the same as my boys in that they have the same rules and consequences like losing allowance or screen time, she was massively spoilt before I came along and as my wife came from several abusive relationships before meeting me she just took all the tantrums and selfish nature of her daughter. \n\nStep daughter now lives with dad (her choice) as he has no boundaries and strangely enough my partner is so much happier. I can imagine her getting upset if we went somewhere nice on vacation without her but to get the good parts of a relationship you do all of it.\n\nIf she has made no effort to get to know you suggest after this vacation that you can both start fresh and she can come the next trip. She\u2019s old enough to know/learn you get what you put into a relationship.", "NTA. Are you going to be expected to stay in another room at all times, to not be able to engage with your husband? She does realize she will have to see you in person, right?", "NTA. \n\nThe daughter either wants the free vacation or wants to ruin your birthday vacation. \n\nAlthough, this could be your chance on starting a relationship with her.", "NTA\n\nit is a couples vacation.... not a family trip.\n\nIf she wants to grt to know you, holiday is not the time.", "NTA\n\nBut this isn't a healthy relationship if the daughter refuses to acknowledge you. Why are you putting up with being an ignored part of your partner's life?", "NTA\n\nI can foresee her being rude and dismissive of you the entire vacation as well.", "NTA. I think your husband should ask her why she suddenly is ok with being in your presence. He can suggest some joint FaceTime calls first.\n\nBTW, I think it\u2019s not a great sign that husband is fine with forcing you out of the room while he FaceTimes his daughter, and you apparently can\u2019t even see her when you visit their country. Has he done anything to try to facilitate a relationship between the two of you? Counseling? Anything?", "NTA - even if you two had a healthy relationship, this is still *your birthday vacation*. It's your celebration. You are well within your right to decide who you want to share it with; that doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nThey want a free vacation, you said no. It's that simple.", "NTA You also have an husband problem as well. Your husband obviously doesn't seem to care how his daughter treats you, so therefore if he wants her to go on holidays to Hawaii then he can pay for the 3 of you. He also needs to step up and teach his daughter that being disrespectful towards you is unacceptable and it needs to stop.\n\nIn the meantime both your husband and stepdaughter can accept the consequences of her actions, because if she's rude to you and ignores you, then she needs to accept that she's not going to be going on a fun overseas holiday that your funding. She's not entitled to a holiday funded by you, and both of them can't have their cake and eat it too.", "NTA she doesnt want to see you she just wants a vacation, and she will problably walk all over you try to get you to do the things she likes.", "NTA", "NTA First off its your birthday and the only reason she wants to go is because Hawaii.", "NTA. Yes, husbands daughter will be sad, but thats because husband did not try harder with his own daughter. Its him who should have tried more to have his daughter get to know you. He failed and he is the AH for saying \"Its up to you\". He jsut did not have the balls to say what is obvious. He helft it to you to make his daughter sad.", "NTA if you say yes, the next thing will be she is asking you to stay home from the vacation, or saying it should just be her and daddy going snorkelling, going to see the waterfall, or out for dinner in the evening, whilst you must go do something else.", "NTA ex is free to pay for a trip for a trip where they take the teen.", "NTA. You can't even be in the same room with your husband when she's on an iPad, how are you supposed to be in the same room with her in person?\n\nAlso, it's *your* birthday celebration. Why would you invite anyone who refuses to have a relationship with you?", "NTA - she's made it clear she doesn't want a relationship with you, and you're respecting her wishes by not communicating with her. That means she misses out on being a part of your life, including the cool vacations.", "NTA \n\nShe refuses to acknowledge your existence and all of a sudden.. poof! Heck with that noise! What a little opportunist she is! \n\nEmail her mother back and tell her that you are under no obligation to take her kid with you to Hawaii since according to her daughter.. you didn\u2019t exist until there was something SHE wanted to do.. then all of a sudden she wants you in her life?   \n\nI\u2019d nope the hell out too until that child and her mother (who obviously supports her nasty behavior) learn some manners and quit trying to control the narrative of YOUR home and relationship. I mean.. hey, you\u2019re not forcing the situation to talk to her, or push yourself on her, so how convenient of her to suddenly think she has any rights to your vacation and both of them playing the ShE\u2019s HiS ChIlD card. That\u2019s not how it works and even if you DID take her she\u2019d make it miserable for you.\n\nEdited to add that a lot of this is not entirely the child\u2019s fault as I feel the mother encourages the behavior instead of making it a situation where everyone gets along.", "INFO: There's a lot of missing information. Why would your husband move to a different country from where his kid lives? How does visitation work if he lives in a different country? Why does his daughter hate you? For example, Is it because your husband moved to another country for you, so she sees it as her Dad abandoned her for you? Or because your relationship started very soon after the divorce - or before the divorce was finalised - so she blames her father's absence in her life on you? Do you two usually invite her on your holidays or never before? Was your husband ok getting married without his daughter present? Could his daughter believe her Dad is lying about it being your bday trip to exclude her?\n\nIt's quite hard to judge because while her behaviour seems unreasonable from your POV, it's clear from daughter's & ex-wife POV they have a lot of built up tension towards your husband because of how he is as a Dad. And this Hawaii issue may be their feelings towards your husband coming to the surface. And possibly getting projected onto you.", "Idk I think it\u2019s a good idea since you\u2019ll get to know her and maybe start a relationship.. it\u2019s not easy for kids to accept someone else in their life.. also your a grown women and she is just a kid.. you can refuse but this will permanently damage your future relationship with her and if that happens husband could feel pressure to leave you. A good parent sticks by their kids side and wife can come and go but kids are for life.. also your husband might not enjoy himself or end up resenting you when his kid undoubtedly throw it in his face.. don\u2019t start been the evil stepmom now!!

That's a fun afternoon.\n\nThere are so many sights to see and things to do on all the islands, and plan jumping is surprisingly cheaper then you'd expect. . Don't forget to check out the sea turtles and try to spot a whale off shore! There are helicopter tours, whale watching cruises, and some amazing snorkeling and scuba diving sights.

A lot of context is missing!", "Why is on the daughter's job - who is still a kid - to mend her relationship with her Dad and take initiative with her StepMum? OP's husband is the parent. He's the one who chose to move abroad post-divorce and not fly back frequently to see his daughter. He's the one who married OP before bridging the gap between his daughter & OP. The one who married a women before he had put in the work to facilitate a relationship between OP and his child.", "in the first sentence .. \u201cM34 has a teenage daughter\u2026\u201d", "Exactly!", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite getting my point. Biological parents take couples only trips without their biological kids all the time. Sure, hypothetically, if this was a trip to Disney and they were taking some niece or nephew or something it would be an AH move but this is a couples birthday trip. \n\nWhy is the standard for step kids different?", "Well OP never says the age of the stepdaughter, so we don't know if she's 13 or 19. I really wish OP would just say the age!\n\n\nYes it's the father's responsibility to reach out. If the kid is closer to an adult age (18-19) then it's a bit weird she wants to join her Dad and new wife on a romantic trip to Hawaii. The Dad should suggest a new way to meet the new stepmother.  If she is a kid-kid (<16), then the father and ex Mom need to work together with OP to facilitate a new relationship especially with co-parenting. You're right in thinking the Dad needs to be the one to make effort in repairing this relationship with his kid as she is *HIS* kid, not OP's.", "Got you! I missed it. I am always looking for exact ages lol so I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t see numbers.\u201d I do still wonder how old. 13? 16? 18? It matters.", "OP hasn't responded to any of the INFO questions asking to clarify the age of daughter, why her husband moved abroad, how often husband sees his kid and length of their relationship compared to the divorce.\n\n70% of the time in AITA when a person refuses to answer repeatedly asked questions relevant for the judgement, it's because the answers paint them in a certain light. As in this post most have already judged NTA and INFO requests downvoted because people were struck by the audacity of someone wanting to be included on the bday trip of someone they dislike, if OP wants she can take the NTA judgement that aligns with her POV without needing to provide full context that might change people's votes. Children usually have a different take on a situation that influences their actions. I've personally never met a devoted parent who happily gave up custody to move abroad without causing their kid hurt/resentment. Devoted parents don't marry someone their minor child dislikes. \n\nI will add usually in this sub when I refer to 18/19 as teenagers, people downvote me & insist those ages don't count as teenagers but young adult. So realising that's how most people see 18/19 plus the email from ex-wife and OP mentioning full custody& visitation, I will be very surprised if the daughter is 18/19. The context clues in the post makes it sound like she's a teenage child not a teenage young adult.", "same here lol"]}
