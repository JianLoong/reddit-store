That aside, I eat very simple foods. I\u2019m not a fan of overcomplicated or fancy food. It\u2019s just wasted on me.\n\nE.g. I can literally eat a bowl of just plain rice and be perfectly happy.\n\nI\u2019m aware the problem is with me, so I make sure I don\u2019t make my issues a problem for anyone else. So, for example, if I get a burger at a restaurant, I\u2019ll ask for it well done and to apologise to the chef. If I\u2019m part of a group and the majority want something I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m not bothered by getting sides to form a meal since I won\u2019t eat any mains offered. _It\u2019s my problem, no one else\u2019s._\n\nBut this chef I\u2019ve worked with 5 days a week for over a year now. At first he asked a lot of questions and I was happy to answer - I\u2019ve tried telling him what I like, what I don\u2019t like, how I like things, types of cuisine (eg, Mexican, Italian, and Indian - simple foods that are quick, cheap, and easy. The restaurant we work at already sells tacos\u2026) I\u2019ve given examples of meals, told him what I cook for myself, showed him pictures of what I cook for myself. He even asked my girlfriend about it and her advice, although embarrassing, was: \u201cif you wouldn\u2019t serve it to a 5yo don\u2019t serve it to him.\u201d\n\nHe decides what to cook on a day-to-day basis so preplanning isn\u2019t always possible and there\u2019s no microwave so cooking food at home and bringing it in isn\u2019t possible. I do on occasion bring dinner in but food costs in the U.K. are stupid right now so I\u2019m really trying to make this work.\n\nI understand staff food is free and I should be grateful - and I usually am - so if I don\u2019t eat a meal I won\u2019t find alternatives, I\u2019ll go hungry, but not once have I _ever_ complained about the food or being hungry. Ever.\n\nHere\u2019s the clincher: he experiments with my food. (Edit - he has explicitly said he does) He\u2019ll test things out on me but without asking me about it first. I just turn up to a bowl full of things I wont eat. I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was a taster, but not the whole meal. I also find it arrogant that he feels like it\u2019s appropriate to try and alter my diet because he doesn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve told him that if I don\u2019t eat dinner I don\u2019t eat at all so it\u2019s probably not the best time to experiment, but he does anyways.\n\nLast night he made a dish that ticked zero boxes and it really upset me because after a year I feel like the problem isn\u2019t entirely with me anymore. But I also noticed he served my colleague a serving thrice the size of mine, which gave me the impression he knew I wouldn\u2019t like it so gave me less, which upset me more.

I believe he thought you were a cute little riddle he could solve and when he couldn\u2019t make you budge (sneaking shit into your food is rude and gives me roofie vibes) he lost interest idk I may be reading into that but it is weird he did that for a yr and then nothing.

You say that you've spoken to him about it multiple times but you don't mention what his responses have been.\n\nIf a daily staff meal is literally a part of your compensation package, and not just a bonus snack for those who happen to be working a double or whatever, then I would suggest talking to your GM and seeing if you can work something else out, like maybe the kitchen can make you one order of something that you can eat before they shut down after lunch or whatever (again, hard to say without knowing how your resto runs.)\n\nOr bring a sandwich.", "Info does the whole staff eat the same food or does he do an individual meal per person?", "INFO what exactly is he making?

The meal he made was for ALL those working that night so NO it shouldn't be just to your tastes.   I get it, I have foods that I'd need to choke down that others really like. But unless your place does not serve side salads or veggies, you could find something to eat that isnt causing the chef to cook more.

There isn't enough info on the staff meal as a whole or individual basis, but as someone with ARFID and it coming down to texture-based food aversion, I get you. Actually, you might want to look into that since its more of an official title from the last decade. Despite the awareness of being the problem with food your whole life, in adulthood, there's little to no sympathy. A picky five year old only wants chicken nuggets for three weeks, a kid with texture aversions will throw up or starve themselves when in contact with those textures. Adulthood is managing it better, avoiding foods like that, and getting through a bite of just nausea. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to eat the food. You lack of expectancy for accommodations sounds right too. But I've met these people before who think they can change you. They think it's different if it's their cooking and completely miss the point. Acceptable experimentation besides consent would be something like making the texture a non-issue. Putting vegetables into a sauce but blending it up to the point where there's no chunks. Stuff like that where it addresses your issue but still allows for the possible introduction of more flavors. Not just throwing a bunch of things in a bowl you've already pointed out for a year you do not like. \n\nNow in terms of solutions here, especially since it could be some sort of joint meal and whatnot, I would suggest doing what I did to get through meals when I lived in the UK and my palate couldn't even adjust for that: Making Japanese bento food. Ignoring the cutesy videos, the basic premise is hot food put in containers designed for keeping it hot, and food that is okay to eat at nearly room temperature. There is a food prep aspect to it to make it manageable cooking. You can make rice in bulk and freeze it in one portion bags, make small sides and freeze them in silicon cupcake molds. You prepare the meat however you like and defrost or put in the fridge the night before. Your getting ready routine becomes heating up (cooking meat on a pan quick usually does it) the components, putting into container, then bag that maintains heat. That bag goes with you to work, and when you have your break, it's perfectly good food that is safe to eat even cooled if you had to wait that long in a shift. This wouldn't exactly work out with something like fries that would get cold and soggy, but there's tons of Japanese food with plain flavors and ground meat that would be moist and delicious 8 hours later even. The Just Bento Cookbook does a great job dividing recipes by meat type, and it originally started as a website blog so there's a lot of it online. I'd highly recommend trying recipes out, reheating them to see if you like them that way, and adapting to this since there's not really anyway around this besides accommodating yourself. It's just a suggestion, but good luck.", "NTA he is tampering with your food and that is ILLEGAL. He needs to STOP NOW.

Most places just make a few big pans of pasta, or potatoes and a cheap protein, etc. A place with a lot of mouths to feed probably wouldn't go out of their way to accommodate special requests unless it was an actual allergy. If it's the kind of place where there are only a few (less than 10) staff, and everyone knows each other very well because they work together every day, then it's maybe more likely that they'll be able to make modifications - but it seems like OP doesn't like a lot of foods that would be considered \"normal\" (he says he'll only eat minced beef, so a piece of steak would be a no go) so how far do they go to accommodate him? Order a box of frozen chicken nuggets and keep them in the freezer just for him?\n\nI think the sticky thing here is that OP's preferences are just that. They're not allergies or religious restrictions or rooted in a belief system. As such, they're seen (probably rightly, IMO) as less important, and creating a bespoke staff meal for someone just because they \"don't like\" the meal that everyone else is happily eating is not only a bit of a kick in the nuts to the people that made that meal, but it takes extra time and effort that they hadn't budgeted for.", "Everywhere I've worked it's a take it or leave it kinda thing.

Also he's told you you can't order anything specific for family meal, you can't use any expensive ingredients, you can't take much time away from the other stuff you have to do. But no worries, you can do that every shift, right? After all, you love getting to know your coworkers and why would you not want to make food everyone will enjoy? \ud83d\ude09", "But maybe the rice is cooked with things that his palate won't handle?

Several of my coworkers have different eating styles, diets that they follow, religious restrictions, allergies, and even just likes/dislikes (like OP).
