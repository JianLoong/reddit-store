That aside, I eat very simple foods. I\u2019m not a fan of overcomplicated or fancy food. It\u2019s just wasted on me.\n\nE.g. I can literally eat a bowl of just plain rice and be perfectly happy.\n\nI\u2019m aware the problem is with me, so I make sure I don\u2019t make my issues a problem for anyone else. So, for example, if I get a burger at a restaurant, I\u2019ll ask for it well done and to apologise to the chef. If I\u2019m part of a group and the majority want something I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m not bothered by getting sides to form a meal since I won\u2019t eat any mains offered. _It\u2019s my problem, no one else\u2019s._\n\nBut this chef I\u2019ve worked with 5 days a week for over a year now. At first he asked a lot of questions and I was happy to answer - I\u2019ve tried telling him what I like, what I don\u2019t like, how I like things, types of cuisine (eg, Mexican, Italian, and Indian - simple foods that are quick, cheap, and easy. The restaurant we work at already sells tacos\u2026) I\u2019ve given examples of meals, told him what I cook for myself, showed him pictures of what I cook for myself. He even asked my girlfriend about it and her advice, although embarrassing, was: \u201cif you wouldn\u2019t serve it to a 5yo don\u2019t serve it to him.\u201d\n\nHe decides what to cook on a day-to-day basis so preplanning isn\u2019t always possible and there\u2019s no microwave so cooking food at home and bringing it in isn\u2019t possible. I do on occasion bring dinner in but food costs in the U.K. are stupid right now so I\u2019m really trying to make this work.\n\nI understand staff food is free and I should be grateful - and I usually am - so if I don\u2019t eat a meal I won\u2019t find alternatives, I\u2019ll go hungry, but not once have I _ever_ complained about the food or being hungry. Ever.\n\nHere\u2019s the clincher: he experiments with my food. He\u2019ll test things out on me but without asking me about it first. I just turn up to a bowl full of things I wont eat. I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was a taster, but not the whole meal. I also find it arrogant that he feels like it\u2019s appropriate to try and alter my diet because he doesn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve told him that if I don\u2019t eat dinner I don\u2019t eat at all so it\u2019s probably not the best time to experiment, but he does anyways.\n\nLast night he made a dish that ticked zero boxes and it really upset me because after a year I feel like the problem isn\u2019t entirely with me anymore. But I also noticed he served my colleague a serving thrice the size of mine, which gave me the impression he knew I wouldn\u2019t like it so gave me less, which upset me more. Sort of like he\u2019s not even bothered anymore.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make this work and trying to be understanding, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1682083241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u1jlo/aita_for_having_trouble_with_staff_food/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe he thought you were a cute little riddle he could solve and when he couldn\u2019t make you budge (sneaking shit into your food is rude and gives me roofie vibes) he lost interest idk I may be reading into that but it is weird he did that for a yr and then nothing.

You say that you've spoken to him about it multiple times but you don't mention what his responses have been.\n\nIf a daily staff meal is literally a part of your compensation package, and not just a bonus snack for those who happen to be working a double or whatever, then I would suggest talking to your GM and seeing if you can work something else out, like maybe the kitchen can make you one order of something that you can eat before they shut down after lunch or whatever (again, hard to say without knowing how your resto runs.)\n\nOr bring a sandwich.", "Info does the whole staff eat the same food or does he do an individual meal per person?", "INFO what exactly is he making?

But unless your place does not serve side salads or veggies, you could find something to eat that isnt causing the chef to cook more.

But if they're not going to eat it & it bothers them they're being offered food that everyone knows they won't eat, just tell them not to include you.   \nMaybe speak with your boss about having some things/ingredients on hand so you can eat something that you do like if that's a part of your benefits.", "The chef isn't obligated to make per specification meals for each staff member.\n\nIt's a provision. An offer. In the UK there are plenty of back up standby meals he could babe at work. Eg the fish pasta meals that are long life, cup a sopus, pastas etc. Or do what thousands do daily, and make a sandwich or salad at home to take in.\n\nYTA.", "I used to work in a kitchen at an old folks home (nice one) and we would eat the leftovers that didn\u2019t get eaten. Eating for free was a peek at this place cuz free food. If there wasn\u2019t enough for everyone ppl would do rock paper scissors for it or the chef would make an entirely new meal with the leftovers that could feed everyone. Some things were good and some things were not so good lol. It didn\u2019t make the chefs creative with the meals and some even got added to the menu. I personally would eat the food even if I didn\u2019t care for it since I would be that hungry after a busy shift. I feel like no one is the asshole. But I\u2019m going off the assumption of how it was working in the kitchen based my personal experience and from what my husband said. His kitchen operated the same way kinda", "It's costing the OP energy and focus, things that food are needed for, and possibly job productivity, though.", "yeah definitely and also \"just cheese and crackers\" is so expensive in the uk rn \ud83d\ude2d", "Making rice is not a whole meal.", "That's the thing, if the \"things that might not be used otherwise\" aren't things that OP likes to eat, then OP is never going to like the staff meal, but the chef's hands are tied. The cost of wholesale product has risen just like the cost of consumer foods. Most places make staff meal with whatever they have to spare that has a low food cost. Very few places would order in specific product just for staff meal.", "Actually, its not. In most places staff meals are whatever is cooked or ready to be cooked for the day or make yourself a sandwich. The chefs are there to be at your beck and call.", "I'm guessing that OP is a server because of the way he talks about the chef. Actual back of house kitchen staff would use a different tone, and they would probably just make themselves some toast and get back to work if they didn't like what was made for staffy.", "My point is that most workplaces that provide food do it cafeteria style, whats on the menu is what you get, not catering to every individual staff members wishes and desires", "Normally I would believe that, but it sounds like this chef is being a dick on purpose.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. To me, it sounded like he was eating dinner until the chef started being a dick. I think speaking to the boss is a good solution.", "I didn\u2019t say the chef should make meals specifically for OP. The chef should stop experimenting with OP\u2019s meals and give him the same options he gives everyone else.", "But it sounds like the chef is intentionally making food that OP won't eat just to mess with him, it possibility \"broaden his horizons.\"", "Chef could cook plain rice and heat it up for 4,5 days for OP?\nChef's hands are NOT tied.", "The chef isn't being a dick. He doesn't have to make specialty foods for picky individuals, and usually the person with that job wouldn't,  he would just cook the same thing for everyone. It sounds to me like the chef has been very accommodating in trying to find something that this guy will eat", "He\u2019s experimenting with someone\u2019s food without their consent. OP never asked for individually made meals. Y\u2019all clearly can\u2019t read.", "Seems like with such simple preferences op should one of the easiest people in the world cook for. Dude literally said he'd be happy with a bowl of plain rice.", "Except he absolutely is, asking specifically for the things that his 3rd grade pallet can handle.", "Where does it say that he asked the chef to make food specially for him?"]}
