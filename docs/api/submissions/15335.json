That aside, I eat very simple foods. I\u2019m not a fan of overcomplicated or fancy food. It\u2019s just wasted on me.\n\nE.g. I can literally eat a bowl of just plain rice and be perfectly happy.\n\nI\u2019m aware the problem is with me, so I make sure I don\u2019t make my issues a problem for anyone else. So, for example, if I get a burger at a restaurant, I\u2019ll ask for it well done and to apologise to the chef. If I\u2019m part of a group and the majority want something I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m not bothered by getting sides to form a meal since I won\u2019t eat any mains offered. _It\u2019s my problem, no one else\u2019s._\n\nBut this chef I\u2019ve worked with 5 days a week for over a year now. At first he asked a lot of questions and I was happy to answer - I\u2019ve tried telling him what I like, what I don\u2019t like, how I like things, types of cuisine (eg, Mexican, Italian, and Indian - simple foods that are quick, cheap, and easy. The restaurant we work at already sells tacos\u2026) I\u2019ve given examples of meals, told him what I cook for myself, showed him pictures of what I cook for myself. He even asked my girlfriend about it and her advice, although embarrassing, was: \u201cif you wouldn\u2019t serve it to a 5yo don\u2019t serve it to him.\u201d\n\nHe decides what to cook on a day-to-day basis so preplanning isn\u2019t always possible and there\u2019s no microwave so cooking food at home and bringing it in isn\u2019t possible. I do on occasion bring dinner in but food costs in the U.K. are stupid right now so I\u2019m really trying to make this work.\n\nI understand staff food is free and I should be grateful - and I usually am - so if I don\u2019t eat a meal I won\u2019t find alternatives, I\u2019ll go hungry, but not once have I _ever_ complained about the food or being hungry. Ever.\n\nHere\u2019s the clincher: he experiments with my food. (Edit - he has explicitly said he does) He\u2019ll test things out on me but without asking me about it first. I just turn up to a bowl full of things I wont eat. I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was a taster, but not the whole meal. I also find it arrogant that he feels like it\u2019s appropriate to try and alter my diet because he doesn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve told him that if I don\u2019t eat dinner I don\u2019t eat at all so it\u2019s probably not the best time to experiment, but he does anyways.\n\nLast night he made a dish that ticked zero boxes and it really upset me because after a year I feel like the problem isn\u2019t entirely with me anymore. But I also noticed he served my colleague a serving thrice the size of mine, which gave me the impression he knew I wouldn\u2019t like it so gave me less, which upset me more. Sort of like he\u2019s not even bothered anymore.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make this work and trying to be understanding, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1682083241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u1jlo/aita_for_having_trouble_with_staff_food/", "score": 502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe he thought you were a cute little riddle he could solve and when he couldn\u2019t make you budge (sneaking shit into your food is rude and gives me roofie vibes) he lost interest idk I may be reading into that but it is weird he did that for a yr and then nothing.

You say that you've spoken to him about it multiple times but you don't mention what his responses have been.\n\nIf a daily staff meal is literally a part of your compensation package, and not just a bonus snack for those who happen to be working a double or whatever, then I would suggest talking to your GM and seeing if you can work something else out, like maybe the kitchen can make you one order of something that you can eat before they shut down after lunch or whatever (again, hard to say without knowing how your resto runs.)\n\nOr bring a sandwich.", "Info does the whole staff eat the same food or does he do an individual meal per person?", "INFO what exactly is he making?

The meal he made was for ALL those working that night so NO it shouldn't be just to your tastes.   I get it, I have foods that I'd need to choke down that others really like. But unless your place does not serve side salads or veggies, you could find something to eat that isnt causing the chef to cook more.
