My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal. I need to know AITA?

I have never heard of that being shared ahead of time, in an announcement.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go, but let that be the absolute end of your objections.

Your memories have nothing to do with the house, the outer banks, or the vendors. If those are what you took away from the wedding, that\u2019s pretty damn shallow. You do not have a monopoly on any aspect of your wedding. Conversely, it sounds as though it was lovely.

I understand why you are annoyed with it but it\u2019s so dramatic to refuse to go to the wedding and claim that they\u2019re overriding your memories. Your wedding was 5 years ago, it won\u2019t be the exact same as your day was and I guarantee you other people probably don\u2019t remember every single detail from your day.

My husband and I were married in August, and she and her husband were married in November. Same venue, same music, same flowers, same menu, everything. I can\u2019t say I was ever annoyed with it, but it just seemed very, very strange. I never said anything to anyone about it to anyone except my husband, and he told me I should find it flattering. Several people at the reception took me aside and said things along the lines of, \u201cThese were your ideas first, and it was lovely.\u201d  I suggest you go to the wedding and take the higher ground.

It could be she has no original ideas of her own and she so loved your wedding, she wanted the very same thing.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird, and while you don't own the venue, I struggle to understand why they don't at least change the villa.

That may work well when you type it on the internet, but in real life people can and will think it's weird af if someone else in the family copies literally everything unless it was approved by the original couple. I'd definitely be kind of ? if I saw this go down. \n\nNTA.", "I would feel sad for someone who has so little originality. Your wedding isn't any less.

Maybe one or several of those factors independently is fine (tbh I\u2019d probably still be giving side eye) but all of them together is a lot.", "My knee jerk reaction is this is weird AF so NTA. Reading a bit more, I get it because some ppl wanna have a wedding but just can\u2019t be bothered to plan anything or be original (weddings are all the same to me btw) so it IS flattering. Regardless, you don\u2019t have to attend any weddings you don\u2019t want to attend and if this is going to make you do (or want to do) something to ruin SIL\u2019s day then don\u2019t go.

Yes, it's weird that she's copying your wedding. But it's a copy. Her wedding album will not be in your house. The memories of her wedding won't override the memories of your wedding.

Maybe something about the place became special to them.  Maybe they don\u2019t like choosing unknown places.  Who knows?

I have drink a bottle of wine so this could be good!\n\n\n\nDiplomatic answer is that yes it is an asshole move but fil is right! you do not have the copyright to the venue and beach. They have the right to be lazy and use your plans. It will not take away from the memories you made because when you did your wedding it was unique and interesting. Hers is going to be the been there done that version. People will judge her.l am silently judging her for this and I don\u2019t know her! She will be talked about!\n\nNot for the petty version. If you don\u2019t have social media get on a platform. Preferably one that all the guest sil will invite are on. Start posting wedding pictures. With captions! Such as:\n\n(name of beach) best place for destination wedding! \n\nglad hubby and I spent time finding the perfect beach! (Name of beach) was the best place for us to married in!\n\nFind pictures of the venue! Post said pictures. Add the caption saying;\n\n(Name of venue) thank you for amazing memories!\n\n\nPost picture of your stuff from vendors! Add the same caption. Thank x vendors for making our day special!\n\nYou get the drift! Make it loud and proud that this was your wedding choices.\n\nWhen your asked why you did this(and you will be) play innocent.  Tell your in-laws that your sil reminded how\nMuch your wedding meant to you and you wanted to show it off!  Be even apologetic! Make it convincing! Even throw in the fact that fil was right you where upset for nothing and it was such a great compliment! So this inspired you to share with other to give them an amazing idea! Say this In your sweet as honey voice\n\nThis way even if sil continues with her plan! She is going to be the laughing stock because her friends will know she put no thought and effort into planning her day.\n\nAnd most importantly if you get invited (after this stunt you may not) make sure you and your husband go! Say things you know I forgot how perfect this beach was when we got married here! When looking at the house say I forgot how spacious this house was when we rented it for our wedding! At the reception make sure you mention how you forgot how good the food was!  When they go do pictures make sure you comment how they won\u2019t be disappointed with that pose! When you did that exact same pose your pictures were perfect! Be loud and proud when remembering everything!\n\nBonus points if you look at a guest and say remember when we were staying here for my wedding we did this and had so much fun! We need to do that again!", "Going against the grain here with NTA.\n\nThe copied wedding destination is pretty weird. Maybe I don't hold weddings in as much sanctity as other people. If you'd be uncomfortable or aggravated or resentful, don't go. You have a right to your feelings.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. I know everyones saying you don\u2019t own a venue, which is correct. but also,,, there is a million other venues, beaches, houses, etc. Photos can be excused because honestly you guys probably didnt do anything out of the ordinary with the poses and they probably mean that they want to pose in the same places/way so they can do a comparison post to show off that its the same place. It\u2019s still weird they didn\u2019t check with you but it\u2019s too late now. \n\nOverall, i believe that you have a right to feel uncomfortable and not want to go after spending so much time and effort just for someone to reclaim that (and learn from any mistakes you made if you had any issues). NTA for not attending, you are free to do that, but I would stop complaining, it will go nowhere and you will burn bridges. they probably spent a lot of money and time recreating everything (you would know how much, just factor out your time/money spent searching and thats how much) and they probably aren\u2019t going to change everything for one/two people. \n\nYou can also take it in stride and also recreate your old wedding photos in regular attendee attire too, like an x-years-later post. (don\u2019t ask the photographer without permission, id just have a friend take the pics) No one would really complain so long as you don\u2019t show up in a wedding dress and your partner in their old attire, that\u2019d be one too many coincidences!", "NTA.

That is the most bizarre and unoriginal thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Good for you though for not being super petty by going and then just ridiculing the wedding.", "NTA\n\nJust tell them you aren't changing your mind. \nThey can happily do whenever they'd like, but you are going to preserve your memories and not create any bad ones for them, and won't attend.", "NTA.

No. Is it weird and rude as hell to use the same venue and vendors as your sibling and basically try to redo their wedding? Yes. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this is a popular local venue, she chose the same exact venue in a different region. She should be embarrassed for being so unoriginal. \n\nAlso, copying someone\u2019s wedding is NOT a compliment in any way and your FIL is an asshole for trying to insult your intelligence and manipulate you that way.", "Hmmmm... I had a lovely backyard wedding, a few marquees up, hired stacks of white chairs, got catering and had a friend of a friend be the barman with an absolute stack of Eskys.  It was excellent and low key.\n\nMy husband's cousin and his partner loved it and they copied it directly a year later, except they held it at his parents property, which was about twenty times bigger and fancier than ours.  I didn't care and was actually happy to have had the idea copied.  I'm still trying to sell how good a non traditional wedding is to people.\n\nYour one, they are using the exact same location.and stuff,  but it's been FIVE YEARS.  There's probably been hundreds of weddings since at that spot.  Anyone else who goes to both won't remember, or at least not enough to compare.    I'm with your FIL and calling it a compliment too.

Get over it and stop making enemies with family over stupid crap!", "YTA, first of all for lying. \n\n*at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I.* \n\nBullshit. Nobody announces what their poses are going to be in their upcoming wedding. What a stupid claim. \n\nAlso YTA for being petty and not having more respect for your own wedding. Memories are memories.

Lots and lots of people are going to have weddings at the same location using the same vendors. Who cares? Get over yourself", "YTA. There are only so many wedding venues and suppliers to go around, and you don't have exclusive use of yours.

You're being ridiculous.", "YTA no one can \"override your memories\". You and your husband have already had your own experience there. You don't get to gatekeep the venue.

While her choice seems a bit strange, your reaction is melodramatic & sounds more like a teenage freak out over a similar prom dress than something a fully grown adult should be worrying about", "yta who cares if she is copying it you aint that special get a life.", "YTA good grief. No wedding anywhere is unique at this point,only the people in it. You could have had a lovely time reminiscing about how great your wedding was. You could have taken a series of wonderful 'Us, 5 years later' photos.\n\nInstead you make a child of yourself by being annoyed that someone else wanted a wedding as nice as yours. Frankly, you sound like hard work.", "YTA  yes it\u2019s weird but they can choose where they want to get married", "YTA. As numerous people have said you don\u2019t own any of the vendors, the beach or rental home. Your wedding was 5 years ago and no one can steal your memories away or make them any less valid. And I agree that there\u2019s some exaggerating on the photo poses. That sounds ridiculous, but even if she is, you can\u2019t gatekeep those either. \n\nYou\u2019re choosing to stress the relationship with the entire family because SiL is copying your wedding. Seems childish & like you\u2019re insecure. \n\nDo I find it a little odd? Yes, but she/they clearly loved your ideas. And she/they don\u2019t need you or your husband\u2019s permission or opinion to do so.", "YTA and you\u2019re being really petty refusing to go because someone \u201ccopied\u201d your wedding from 5 years ago. I\u2019m sure people get married at that venue all the time, you can\u2019t dibs it indefinitely. \n\nAlso it\u2019s going to be completely different because they are a different couple and will have different guests. This will ultimately lead to a different experience. Peoples memories aren\u2019t like vhs tapes, no one is going to delete yours for this one. \n\nYou\u2019ve also made this sound like she\u2019s copied every aspect, but yeah obviously the same venue is going to be in the same state and on the same beach, I feel like you\u2019re trying to make it sound worse. As for the photographs, if you look up any wedding venue all the photos are going to be very similar because that\u2019s the ideal spot at those venues. \n\nHonestly you need to get over yourselves, your wedding was so long ago and other people are allowed to have good experiences too. You should take it as a compliment that your SIL loved it so much she wanted to go there too.", "Yta.", "YTA. You don\u2019t support the wedding. Which is 1 day. So now what, are you going to see them at other events and hate them for life\u2014because you OWN memories?", "YTA \n\nYour response is very childish. There is no way her wedding can override your memories. People are having weddings at that same destination venue on a regular basis.", "YTA. Get over it, if you don't like her and don't want a good relationship moving forward with your husbands family, than go for it. 3 of my 4 sisters (including myself) all got married at the same venue, same caterer. Guess what? No one gave a crap. All of our photos looked different bc we all have different taste with colors/style. And a beach is a damn beach. Are you the only ones allowed to have a beach wedding? Lol. The outer banks is an amazing place, go have a great week and relive the memories of your wedding.", "YTA. Five years have passed. Who cares? Why are you so bothered by this? Do you think that the guests are going to remember your wedding and think less of it somehow? If not, do you feel like attending will make you think less of your own wedding? I just don't understand what \"overriding our memories\" means. That's just word salad. They get to choose their own venue, vendors, etc. Take it as a compliment, and try to get over yourself.", "You were married FIVE years ago and you want to keep ownership of every place and every merchant that was involved in your wedding? Do you expect your sister-in-law to not invite any guest who went to your wedding as well? Grow up, OP. YTA.", "YTA.  You don't own wedding venues.  You don't own the beach.  I would take it as a compliment that she chose what you did.  You are being very petty here.  You should apologize for being self absorbed and attend the wedding.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Hate to be one to tell you this but aren't the only person to ever get married at that place", "Nah this would annoy me because why would u copy everything .. u can choose the same venue but personalize it", "NAH. Others are right, you don\u2019t own the venue and can\u2019t gate keep who gets married there or how they set it up. But I do get why you\u2019re upset about it. It\u2019s no longer a special place just for you and your husband. And yes, it\u2019s a wedding venue, lots of people get married there. But generally speaking it\u2019s not someone you know and almost certainly not someone in the immediate family so it does feel like it goes against unwritten social rules.", "Father in law is correct that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married.\nAnd you have the right to decline attending said wedding.", "I don\u2019t understand why you think that just because they are marrying at the same place they will be overriding your memories. Your day was your day and that can\u2019t be changed. To act as if you own the locale take it over the line to YTA.", "You and your husband sound to immature to be married. \n\nYou're not going to his sister's wedding because it's in the same place, etc.\n\nsmdh...YES! YTA...grow up    You could have even made it into some sort of family tradition but that would be to easy, right?", "YTA. Who cares? It\u2019s a compliment to you that you found a nice spot for your wedding. Get over yourself and be happy for the couple.", "YTA", "Yta. Is it strange, absolutely but it can also be viewed as a compliment. How you even know what exact poses & such is a little strange too but whatever. It may get under my skin a little  but if you allow it to taint any of your memories than it\u2019s you being ridiculous because even if she had the same dress & same bridesmaids, it\u2019s her day. You alrdy had yours. Why would it bother you if she used some of your ideas (or even all)?! Yours alrdy happened, nothing is taken from your day or your memories. Even if she was so in love with your wedding that she has to copy it. It\u2019s a form of flattery when someone does that. You don\u2019t own the venue or the vendors & to be honest, when she booked the venue, she probably went w the same vendors because they are in that area & she obviously like their services (may have nothing to do w you at all).", "YTA. How does this in any way change anything about your wedding. Before destination weddings, this happened all of the time. Same church. Same reception location. Same band etc. Even generations apart. You sound like a prima donna. They obviously thought it was beautiful. JUST STOP.", "YTA. Who cares? You don't own the place. It's really a stretch to say they are overriding your memories", "YTA\n\nThe poses part is weird. Not sure what you meant by this / if it was an exaggeration. I can understand same locations (as they are likely recommended/best for the location) but actual posing of the humans is weird.\n\nThe rest of it just means that she loved those parts of your wedding. It\u2019s also flattering to know your choices aren\u2019t out of date five years later.\n\nI\u2019ve got family from a smaller town so have attended numerous weddings and events at the same location using the same vendors. Most guests won\u2019t remember the detail the way you will - you\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time planning the detail, everyone else just rocks up and has a good time. The ones who will actually remember the smaller details are the ones who will also remember whose wedding they were attending.\n\nIf it had only been a short while since your wedding, I\u2019d maybe look for another location, but five years is a long time.\n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s not worth damaging your and your husband\u2019s relationship with his family.", "YTA. I thought this was a girl marrying your husband\u2019s brother, but no\u2026this young lady actually attended your wedding and admires you and her brother so much she wants to mimic you. And maybe she is lazy or maybe she suffers from severe anxiety, so copied your wedding. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s pretty materialistic to say this is going to override your own memories of your wedding. That was your special day so your memories should be firmly in place. If you\u2019re worried about whether *other* people are going to remember her wedding instead of yours, who cares? If they cared enough about you and hubs to travel to your wedding, that\u2019s what is important. \n\nI agree with your FIL.", "Your wedding was 5 years ago?! \n\nYTA. Get over yourself. There are other people.", "YTA you don't own the destination, the beach or the vendors. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Who cares?", "YTA - I\u2019m certain your SIL doesn\u2019t know what poses the photographer will suggest - that crossed the line. Have you never seen or been to a wedding and thought \u2018this is beautiful! I\u2019d love to get married here\u2019 your SIL has. She probably has very fond memories of that week. It might not have even been suggested to her by other family members. \n\nNow if SIL really does completely copy you with the same dresses, flowers, etc that\u2019ll be strange - but using the same venue? Not remotely. \n\nPlease don\u2019t make her wedding about yours. whoever you\u2019ve spoken to about this you should call and make amends before you fracture your family.", "Get the fuck over yourselves. \n\nYTA", "As someone who had a wedding and has attended many weddings: Friendly reminder that no one really cares that much about your wedding.  The people that attend just care that they get good food and drinks, and they of course care about you and your spouse in a generally loving way. That\u2019s literally it.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! Maybe she was so impressed with your wedding, she wanted the same for herself; how many others have booked that venue since your wedding (as others have said, you don't own it)? Instead of gushing with her about the place, you did...this; seems that the problem you have is that you know her. YTA. Get over yourself!\ud83d\udc40", "YTA.  Just grow up.  You should be flattered they thought your wedding was an inspiration.", "YTA. Your wedding is over, she can\u2019t \u201coverride your memories\u201d. If anything it\u2019s an excuse to walk down memory lane together revisiting this venue and catching up with your vendors. Is what she\u2019s doing really weird and tacky? Yup. But maybe she typically has terrible taste and remembered how great your wedding was. Just show up and shut down anyone who tries to make comments comparing the two weddings.", "YTA Hundreds of people have probably had the same venue without the weddings being identical.  The fact that your wedding went well is a reference for the place and the vendors. I very much doubt that the details will be exactly the same.  5 years from now almost no one will remember the wedding or look at the pictures.  But they'll remember that you sulked and refused to attend. You're the one who won't come off well.", "ESH. you don't own the state or the venue. Yeah it sucks she's copying but most weddings are pretty much the same thing so I guess she was inspired by what you did and liked it so much she wants the same. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not going to diminish your memories of your own wedding. You have your own pictures and your own memories that you made with your husband. Let It Go. What you could do is go and treat it like a second honeymoon for you and your husband and have a good time. Heck you can always be a jerk to her and say oh can we renew our vows while you're getting married I'm sure she'd love that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure this is rage bait, but on the off chance it isn\u2019t. \n\nThis is dumb as hell! \n\nMy sister, brother, cousin, whoever, could have copied my wedding to the very last detail, and I wouldn\u2019t give a shit. \n\nBecause it still wouldn\u2019t be MY wedding. That lives in my memory forever. My wedding was where I got to marry the love of my life. When we started our life together. \n\nIf you care more about \u201cbeing the only person\u201d who ever used that beach, or venue, or photographer. Then honey, you got married for the all thewrong reasons!", "YTA. Mimicry is the sincerest form of flattery. You did it well and they want the same thing, why you gotta be a hater? \n\nYou could totally use the opportunity to have an anniversary celebration with yourselves and revisit the place that you had such good memories, and share in that with your family.", "Yeah. It would creep me out a little. More so when they move right into your neighbourhood, and start giving their kids the same names as yours.", "NTA, she is.\n\nSure, you don't own the venue, the beach, blah blah blah whatever. But to copy someone else's wedding, particularly to this extent, is a rude AH move. Like, come up with your own ideas!", "Nta. This is not the same as someone happening to use the same vendors and venue because there are only a few options in their small town. This is someone going very far out of their way to mimic another person. Unless this venue has some kind of significance or tie to the family, this is just plain bizarre and creepy.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if people in this thread appreciate that planning a wedding is a lot of work. I think everyone would be annoyed to have someone copying them but it's extra insulting when they are also taking advantage of the effort you put in to make your event a unique and memorable experience. There's a reason why cribbing off the kid next to you is a crummy thing to do", "It's weird, that's fucking weird. \n\nI don't know if YTA, but it's fucking weird as shit.", "Not one person is saying she\u2019s NTA?! She planned all this ahead of it\u2026 and her SIL goes and copies EVERYTHING. Of course she doesn\u2019t own the venue but why is everything where she planned for it? Weird.", "NAH. You never said you own anything, I\u2019m not sure why everyone is using this strawman. \n\nIt IS bizarre she\u2019s copying your wedding, and it would be normal you both feel bad enough that you don\u2019t want to go. \n\nNo one is obligated to go to anyone\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s the real question.", "NTA, tell them you've already been to that wedding, and wish them the best. \n\nEveryone saying you don't \"own\" the venue is right, but also, you don't have to go either. You dont even need reason. You're not gonna have fun and you'll resent them to their face, which won't be fun for anyone. Don't go.\n\nHer wedding will not be exactly like yours no matter how much she copies yours, though. She's taking the lazy way out of planning, and that will be obvious in how little effort she puts in behind the scenes.", "ESH. But I have to say that 2 of my siblings and I had our weddings at the same church and reception venue with the exact same meal. They were each different because the people were different- your friends are not her friends, etc. Just suck it up. P.S. my husband and I once spent a weekend at the place where he went on his honeymoon with his first wife. All weekend,  I kept saying, \u201c oh honey, is this where the magic happened?\u201d Hahaha", "Your wedding was YOUR wedding.  You should feel either proud that you did such a good job she wants to copy you OR feel sorry for her because she is copying you and being so lazy about it.  \n\nI think YTA for getting SO upset about something that is NOT YOUR WEDDING and will never replace your wedding.  I think you need to sit down for a bit and consider if this is the hill you want to die on with  your family.", "Yes\u2026", "Yall are both petty af. Grow up. Esh", "ESH\n\nCopying your wedding is a pretty shitty thing to do, but what makes you think your wedding is completely original?\n\nThe fact you found that place with people already there to provide all the services you wanted says the place is a common wedding spot, and there's a higher than likely chance everything you did at your wedding has been done before in the exact same way you chose to do it since very few weddings are truly original.", "It could be construed as a *lovely compliment*; unfortunately I think you\u2019ve lost the chance to gush repeatedly to her and everyone in hearing distance that you\u2019re so overwhelmed that she loved your event SO much that she had to recreate every last detail, and how thankful you are to have the chance to revisit such wonderful memories \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. I doubt your husband really agrees with you.", "Seems weird but in the end the only one that really remember or care about any detail of your wedding is you.\n\nIf you go you will be surprised at how many dual invitees dont even remember the venue\n\nIf you decide not to go, while i think most people will agree its weird, i wouldnt expect much outrage empathy sympathy support since again most people only care about their own weddings and will barely remember yours from 5 yrs ago.", "Yep. She loved it so much she wants to go again.", "Everyone attending will know it\u2019s a copy of your wedding as they\u2019ve already been there done that. Sad they don\u2019t have any originality but you should attend and look smug about it. Say politely you had just as good a time as the last time you did it", "Why not take it as a compliment instead of being offended. She thought your wedding was beautiful. Be happy that it was.", "Yeah YTA, how can another wedding in the same location override the memories of your own wedding?", "You can\u2019t copyright a wedding, princess. Relax yourself and be nice", "YTA  just for having main character syndrome. Why do you think YOUR wedding was so important? Just a heads up the family is telling you it\u2019s childish, because no one gives a shit about YOUR special day. Learn to deal with not being the center of attention", "YTA, FIL is right.", "So what? It\u2019s five years later. YTA", "The audacity to have a photographer like you guys did.  They better not have a cake.  Oh man do you think they will exchange vows too?  I bet those bastards will even make rings a part of the ceremony.  The nerve to copy you like that!  YTA clown shoes.  And this is fake, they might have suggested that they liked your venue and you decided to create this fictional scenario", "YTA like yeah it\u2019s kinda wierd but \u201cover riding your memories\u201d is SO dramatic", "YTA - grow up. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Boycotting your husband\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding is going to cause a serious rift in his family and I guarantee HE isn\u2019t upset. You are being a spoiled brat and your FIL is 100% right. And guess what? No one at the wedding is going to care that you aren\u2019t there - they will all be having a blast and talking about what a brat you are.", "If you would be pouting at their wedding, just stay home. \nYTA", "YTA.  If this is the biggest problem you ever have, you\u2019ll live a charmed life.", "So bc someone booked a venue that place is no longer able to be In the wedding business.

Whatever.", "Wow you sound tiresome.", "YTA\u2026overriding your memories\u2026LOL.  You should be flattered beyond belief that she thought your wedding was perfect and wants the same for herself.  You are being petty and jealous and childish.  You don\u2019t own the venue or the beach.  Go to the wedding, be nice, and have a genuinely good time.", "YTA, she obviously thought highly of your wedding. If in your own mind it was the perfect wedding, why are you so offended that she agrees? Why should she compromise on less than what she thought was the ideal wedding?\n\nSo now you are going to stay home rather than return to where you were married and had the chance with your husband to reminisce? And you also won't help family in celebration of the newly married couple.\n\nYou seem to be narcissistic and cold.", "OMG more stupid wedding trauma.", "Gotta wonder\u2026is she having the same color scheme, the same style dress and bridesmaids dresses, the same number in the bridal party, the same floral arrangements, the same cake, the same meal, the same music, the same first dance song.  No?  Then get over yourself.\n\nYTA.  Believe me when I tell you that five years after your wedding, no one but you has more than the vaguest of memories of the venue, the vendors or the wedding poses.  Sorry to be harsh, but no one is overriding your memories.  If your memories of your wedding day are so easily overridden, you have bigger issues to worry about.  \n\nIt\u2019s probably a good thing you\u2019re staying home.

Once you put all that together, every guest who attended had a front row view of what a destination wedding there could be and if they really enjoyed it they might give it a go for themselves or family/friends. I'm sure your SIL will have her own spin on things.  Just go and enjoy it.  You liked it enough to have your wedding there.  I think it would be romantic for you and your husband.  Try looking at it from that view instead of a negative way.\n\nThe couple  enjoyed it so much they are planning to do the very same destination, venue, house. As your FIL says, Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  You planned such a wonderful wedding that your SIL wants the same for herself. It doesn't take anything away from you.  Are you saying nobody else should be allowed to have that same venue?  Or just anyone who went to your wedding? This could become a family tradition. Others may follow suit. \n\nCome on OP, lighten up a bit. What made your wedding truly special was the joining of you and your husband in matrimony.  Don't cheapen it by making it all about where it was held.  Your SIL will never over ride your wedding.  Nothing is ever exactly the same.

They loved your wedding so much, they want to experience it themselves. If you don\u2019t want to go, you also don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation so just don\u2019t go. I wouldn\u2019t dwell on this.", "I think I'm leaning towards YTA because this is all so stupid to me lol Yes, I think it's a little weird to want to even get married in the same location but it must have been a really nice wedding. I'm sure the vendors she chose were not only that they were yours but also they're probably recommended for that specific location...same with the photographer. As long as she isn't planning on wearing your wedding dress lol I don't see why you wouldn't want to go? Seems like they enjoyed the area, food, photographer, scenery, etc. and want to make it their spot as well. You're not the only people that have gotten married there. It doesn't \"override\" your wedding or take your memories away. It might even be neat to go back and have a special date with your husband to reminisce about your wedding and  make new memories. And if you and your husband are too upset to go just stay home. Have that be the end of it though. If you're not going to go, don't complain, don't be rude, don't even talk about it.

My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal. I need to know AITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d understand if it was a friend who has totally different family.  SIL is totally copying her brothers wedding.  She may not be overdoing their memories but dang she is literally doing the same exact destination wedding.  At the same venue.  If someone did this to my daughter I\u2019d be pissed on her behalf.  I would also advise her to attend but also do some petty shit like talk about ig we did this also.  Or take anniversary pics their obviously making it not all about SIL", "Yes... and the owners encourage repeat business :p", "That\u2019s what I said, \u201cIt\u2019s weird\u201d\n\nBut unfortunately you don\u2019t get to choose their wedding. Even if it\u2019s in your family. You\u2019re giving it too much significance IMO. Saying your \u201cheart is broken\u201d is over the top. Your allowing it to take away from Your wedding when it doesn\u2019t have to. And honestly this might hurt your feelings but your wedding is most important to YOU and nobody else probably cares about the exact beach, or the house, or the poses in the pictures. Do they care about you? Yes. Do they feel attached to any sort of way to the things you\u2019re attached to from that day? Probably not. I think it feels bigger than it really is.", "But those other houses weren\u2019t good enough for you but you expect them to be good enough for her just so it\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d", "And you didn\u2019t like them as much as this one.", "Cool story. They went to a place for a wedding. They liked the place. They booked the place. Why would you insist someone else make a ceremony celebrating the start of THEIR lives as a married couple all about you? \n\nWho are you, that you're so special that no one else is allowed to do things the same as you ever? I say again. You're not the main character in their wedding.\n\nOn second thoughts, just stay away. It sounds like you're the kind of person that walks around the reception bleating about how you did this first and you did it better but they just copied you. No one needs that kind of energy at what's supposed to be a loving and happy event.\n\nMaybe just don't go so that you can protect yourself from being remembered as the pick me girl at someone else's wedding.", "Another great idea! Extra bonus points if op wears a dress in her wedding colors!\n\nBut the point is that op can take the stance that she is upset and won\u2019t go! They are going to make her the bad guy!\n\nOr she can go and torment the hell out of sil! Play innocent and make her point!\n\nBut the fact is they will not change their mind so go enjoy and look at it this way op and hubby get to go revisit where they got married on someone else\u2019s dime!\n\n\nIf op wants to be extra petty she could ask sil if she wants to rent her dress since she copied everything else!", "> Pretty much everyone \"copies\" wedding poses. Unless you're going to climb trees or strip naked for the photos, they're all pretty much the same.\n\nEven then someone has probably already done that before lol.", "The general idea was there.  They were planning the church/reception usual wedding, came to ours and said they liked it so much they were going to scrap their idea and do the same thing as us, albeit different backyard and budget.  \n\nI'm saying that after five years, lifting the idea isn't the worst thing in the world, and certainly not worth the drama of skipping it.  If it was held a month later, it would be a different issue entirely.  I think enough time has passed that the OP should be able to forgive them, especially if they liked it well enough that in five years no other venue has impressed them more.", "Are they, like, strapping you to some kind of memory-wiping machine to \u201coverride\u201d your memories? Seems very sci-fi.", "You\u2019re a drama queen and a child. Grow up.

Envy, maybe? Admiration, perhaps? Lack of creativity, quite possibly? She can't be hoping to overshadow you because she's doing the exact same thing... So at best the couple is hoping to measure up?", "LIVID, it is then.....\n\nI say NTA. \n\nIf your husband is just as offended, that means something to me. No one knows their family dynamics like those who grew up in said family.

Like yes you did first but that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t to. And using the same vendors has nothing to do w the same wedding.

There aren't a lot of \n 24+ room houses on the OBX. If you rented one of the huge event houses, it makes sense that SIL would want to rent the same one because she already knows it will accommodate her crowd.", "That sucks. That\u2019s theft and different. \n\nSorry but there are no original wedding ideas. You got inspiration from somewhere because someone else did it.", "Well the rest of the quote might make you feel better. \u201cImitation is the highest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness\u201d.

Everyone's imagining really complicated scenarios but it doesn't have to be at all.", "Let\u2019s be real. What wedding is so fu.king great you remember every detail?  Most weddings are restrictive because of the crazy high costs so this is probs average nice enough wedding but way over thinking what anyone else gives a shit about.  You don\u2019t go you will be the biggest idiot ever.  Get over it. You look petty and pathetic.", "My wedding was 5 years ago, Ive forgotten most small details, even some bigger details I only remember if looking at pictures.", "Exactly. It was FIVE years ago. This has to be fake right?", "Most people forget the details of any given wedding as soon as they drive away from the reception. Either every single shared guest has an eidetic memory, or OP\u2019s full of it.", "I was MOH at my sister's wedding and I genuinely could tell you like 2 things from the whole day barely.

No one else cares or remembers these things.", "Hi, how are you doing today I'm new here and I want to make friends \u2764\ufe0f", "that make me hate the phrase like 20% less", "I wouldn\u2019t go tbh. It\u2019s a different thing entirely, but I understand OP\u2019s reticence. My Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s house got turned into a Chinese restaurant after they passed. I was (still quite young, about pre-teen and) desperate to visit and bring back old memories. Sadly it was so upsetting seeing the house so devoid of any trace of my family, it took *years* to be able to envision it correctly again. \n\nI know it\u2019s different, but I wouldn\u2019t want my memories of SILs wedding to bleed into my own, which it will in a few years, especially as it\u2019s exactly the same.", "All of this", "The destination weddings I\u2019ve attended have all been small affairs, like max 40 people and mostly close family and friends. The OP said she invited close family and friends to stay for a full week at a beach house. I don\u2019t know how many people a beach house can hold but it sounds like a small wedding and I assume about half the people attending would be the SILs family who attended the OPs wedding, probably the same bunch who were on the group chat announcement. With that small of a group everyone will know why. \n\nThe whole thing is just bizarre to me. Why would someone choose to fly across the country to essentially have the same wedding as her brother and SILs wedding with half the same people attending? SIL is either too lazy to plan an original wedding or needs some serious therapy.", "Exactly!  \u2b06\ufe0f \n\nFunny enough most people won\u2018t even notice he\u2019s not there and when they hear why everyone will burst out laughing that her own brother is so petty he literally put a rift in the family over some mediocre wedding venue in NC.  Seriously people.  Don\u2019t any of you have someone dying in your life to be able to put silly shit like this into perspective?", "Exactly. The only overlap would be SIL\u2019s/OP\u2019s husband\u2019s family.", "OP should see if she can get a referral bonus...a little $$ to play with!", "Toosh, sir, toosh. \n\n(I'm referencing The Great before anyone yells at me.)", "No I expect her to pick her own place anywhere in the country.

I agree , we all get ideas from weddings we go to, Pinterest, etc. but isn\u2019t it a little different when the guest list is most of the same people? Just a strange move in my opinion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entitled, to go hmm this feels weird. But I do agree, OP should go.", "I know what I'll be doing at my wedding....", "yeah, I am pretty sure I have seen some  tree poses.", "Hyperbole. \u201cFlying four states away\u201d doesn\u2019t change the argument.", "North Carolina.", "Yeah, exactly. Each venue or area has designated spots for photography. OP mentioned in a comment that she\u2019s upset about having the same backdrops in their photos.", "Lol, exactly ! It's so hard to be completely original for destination weddings in the first place! I get a few people fell in love with the area, otherwise, why have a destination wedding? You invite those you love to share a place you love in the hopes they too will love it. I mean, that's why I'd do it! To he upset that it worked is beyond me.", "Send the RSVP like \"I already saw this movie\".", "She mentioned that they were using the same vendors. If they got the same photographer, there would be specific poses favored by that photographer. So it makes sense.", "Been married 25 years and I don\u2019t even look at my wedding photos with any regularity. In fact, I think they might be stored in my garage \ud83e\udd14 I\u2019ll have to check\u2026.", "Then the SIL is in a contest by herself if the OP is smart enough to roll her eyes and laugh it off.  Creating a rift in a family by not attending a family wedding is what everyone will remember and the OP will be considered the petty pathetic one.  Bigger things in life to get worked up about like someone being ill or dying. Save your energy.", "right.  like it's weird to carbon copy a wedding from someone you know but fine.  i'd be laughing my ass off if i was a guest at both.", "yes, that actually does make me feel 20% better, thanks.", "Exactly the point.  You don\u2019t remember many details.  If you repeat the wedding then people are going to wind up remembering pretty much no details.", "I agree with this. My reasoning to go is more for the future of OP\u2019s relationships. I\u2019ve been in a similar place where my spouse and I stood our ground.. and in the end it only hurt us. Flash forward a few years and now we have kids , and the relationships are still somewhat strained. We try to come around for our kids to have relationships, but it\u2019s uncomfortable. I understand the importance of boundaries and all of that, I really do, but I think it would be awful to set up a lifetime of strained family relationships based on SIL being self centered and FIL not having emotional intelligence. The day will come and go, and honestly you would rather the talk of the guests be wow so and so really copied didn\u2019t she?! Than , wow I can\u2019t believe they were so mad they didn\u2019t even show up. Just looking out!", "She couldn\u2019t find anything else she liked that\u2019s not a lie it\u2019s a preference.", "It\u2019s not your place you don\u2019t own it it was yours for your event and it will be HERS for her event.

It was 5 years ago. Grow up.", "I can\u2019t believe you would copy the poses from my wedding!", "You're going to be covered in live bees right?", "But she announced the photography poses in a group text? How would one even describe a photography pose via group chat? And listed all of the wedding vendors? That\u2019s a little odd. Personally when I had my wedding I didn\u2019t announce my florist, DJ, photographer, cake bakery and caterer.", "No. They wouldn\u2019t. We decide on poses based on a lot of things. One couples body type and clothing choice may look completely different than another\u2019s. And repeatedly shooting the same shot in the same place makes our portfolio looks boring and unoriginal and shows we have no creativity to capture what you want.", "I know --right ? Weddings are a point in time not a Life Destination.", "Hmm. I have an album on my phone with all the digital copies. Haven\u2019t looked at it since our first anniversary.", "I threw mine away. I also threw away the newborn baby pic from the hospital. I took my own that were way better.  This is the least important thing in life.", "I\u2019m not one to cut my nose off to spite my face, but for me, my wedding memories would be more important than people who don\u2019t really care about me, beyond being a prop in their lives. \n\nI am sorry you got lumbered with such cruddy in laws though. Both for the initial hurt and that after years it should be water under the bridge.", "I am now!", "I shoot weddings and events, and one of the things I ask is for a list of must-have shots: specific poses and locations at the venue and a list of people they must take a photo with during the portrait session. That way, on the wedding day, I know that I need portraits of the couple with specific people or in a certain area. SiL could easily take that shot list and dump it in a text.\n\nIt's also possible, depending on the venue, that they have their preferred list of vendors. It could be that the venue's preferred vendors are the same ones OP used at her wedding. Or the venue probably still has OP's wedding on record and the vendors used. All SiL has to do is gush that OP recommended the place and she wanted to use the same vendors. OP probably doesn't have on file with the venue, \"Please do not provide vendor info to anyone, especially my meddling SiL.\"", "I think it's less we will stand here... But \" we will take family shots under the bridge\" or \" photos will be taken after the ceremony in the grand hall\".", "I don\u2019t even know that it matters. I was a wedding photographer for 20 years and I made my business off of referrals from family and friends. Sometimes they used the same venues and other vendors. No one cared. And not once did the sets of photos look the same except the family photos which always look the same.", "Our photographer gave me a checklist to check off"]}
