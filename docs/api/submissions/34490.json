My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal. I need to know AITA?

I have never heard of that being shared ahead of time, in an announcement.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go, but let that be the absolute end of your objections. It\u2019s their wedding and they can do whatever they want. You can stay home if you choose. Now move  on.", "Brace yourself for this spicy take\u2026\n\n>by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories\n\nNo they are not. Your memories have nothing to do with the house, the outer banks, or the vendors. If those are what you took away from the wedding, that\u2019s pretty damn shallow. You do not have a monopoly on any aspect of your wedding. Conversely, it sounds as though it was lovely.

I understand why you might be a bit annoyed with it but it\u2019s so dramatic to refuse to go to the wedding and claim that they\u2019re overriding your memories. Your wedding was 5 years ago, it won\u2019t be the exact same as your day was and I guarantee you other people probably don\u2019t remember every single detail from your day. Many other couples have probably thrown similar weddings to you before and many more couples will continue to afterwards.\n\nETA: A lot of venues have preferred partnerships with vendors so that might be why SIL is using them too. Not to mention, it\u2019s not uncommon to pick vendors you\u2019ve seen do good work at other people\u2019s weddings. Unless SIL picks the exact same Center pieces, wedding dress, first dance song, I think OP is over exaggerating how similar the wedding will be to hers and mostly she\u2019s just miffed that they picked the same venue.", "NTA she does have a right to choose any wedding she wishes.

And that is all you have to say about that.", "NTA tell her to get an original idea. What kinda shit is this anyway?", "NTA. But, be the bigger person and GO\u2026take it all in.  Enjoy the day as a guest rather than the star attraction.  It might be fun to rehash that great memory from another perspective.  Every knows\u2026you did it first. Maybe work in a secret little vow renewal/anniversary side hustle for just you and your hubby?", "Like baby names, no one *owns* a wedding experience. \n\nI'd be kind of bored, attending a reboot; the bride should know people will be making comparisons; but it's their day and they can do it the way they want.", "My sister in law copied our wedding too. My husband and I were married in August, and she and her husband were married in November. Same venue, same music, same flowers, same menu, everything. I can\u2019t say I was ever annoyed with it, but it just seemed very, very strange. I never said anything to anyone about it to anyone except my husband, and he told me I should find it flattering. Several people at the reception took me aside and said things along the lines of, \u201cThese were your ideas first, and it was lovely.\u201d  I suggest you go to the wedding and take the higher ground. Absolutely nothing can take away your memories of your day.  It could be she has no original ideas of her own and she so loved your wedding, she wanted the very same thing.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird, and while you don't own the venue, I struggle to understand why they don't at least change the villa.

That may work well when you type it on the internet, but in real life people can and will think it's weird af if someone else in the family copies literally everything unless it was approved by the original couple. I'd definitely be kind of ? if I saw this go down. \n\nNTA.", "I would feel sad for someone who has so little originality. Your wedding isn't any less. If people compare them, it's going to be with a sad head shake. Go. The poor girl deserves your pity. Just smile . You did it first.", "I wouldn't go either so I'm going with NTA. Sure anyone can book the venue and get married however and wherever they want. But also, anyone can decline attending a wedding for any reason at all. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but in this case, it's just irritating. Your FIL can fuck right off with his \"my daughter\" bullshit", "NTA\n\n  \nThis is the ultimate compliment. Maybe creepy, but a compliment. What a sad life your SIL must have that copying someone else's dreams is tthe only thing she has.

NTA. It is so disrespectful to do something like this to family. FiL is right, she has the right to choose her wedding details. But you also have the right to not attend if you don't want to.", "I feel like NTA - that\u2019s weird and I would be upset too. Maybe one or several of those factors independently is fine (tbh I\u2019d probably still be giving side eye) but all of them together is a lot.", "My knee jerk reaction is this is weird AF so NTA. Reading a bit more, I get it because some ppl wanna have a wedding but just can\u2019t be bothered to plan anything or be original (weddings are all the same to me btw) so it IS flattering. Regardless, you don\u2019t have to attend any weddings you don\u2019t want to attend and if this is going to make you do (or want to do) something to ruin SIL\u2019s day then don\u2019t go. Let her have her copy paste wedding and y\u2019all can go anywhere else that day.", "NTA. Even if it was just the same vendors and music OR the same location, copying every aspect is fucking weird.

Is it weird? Yeah. Do you get to have a say? Nope.", "If it\u2019s a wedding venue then the same vendors and photo poses would be the same.  I understand how weird it would be to have your wedding copied, but I guarantee others have used the same place and vendors also.

She's probably jealous", "Just go the wedding and starts putting up your wedding photos around the venues and let others know you were there first. NTA", "YTA if you don't attend. Yes, it's weird that she's copying your wedding. But it's a copy. Her wedding album will not be in your house. The memories of her wedding won't override the memories of your wedding. And frankly, there will be at least a dozen moments where you're going to tell yourself that you did it better.", "YTA.  Did you bother to ask why?  Maybe something about the place became special to them.  Maybe they don\u2019t like choosing unknown places.  Who knows?

You probably copied someone's pinterest board and ripped off ideas from someone else wholesale with no compunctions whatsoever. Just because she happens to know you, she's supposed to protect the 'sanctity' of YOUR wedding location or some such nonsense?\n\nMy wedding venue has been used by thousands of couples over the years. With photos in exactly the same places, and probably the same poses.

I have drink a bottle of wine so this could be good!\n\n\n\nDiplomatic answer is that yes it is an asshole move but fil is right! you do not have the copyright to the venue and beach. They have the right to be lazy and use your plans. It will not take away from the memories you made because when you did your wedding it was unique and interesting. Hers is going to be the been there done that version. People will judge her.l am silently judging her for this and I don\u2019t know her! She will be talked about!\n\nNot for the petty version. If you don\u2019t have social media get on a platform. Preferably one that all the guest sil will invite are on. Start posting wedding pictures. With captions! Such as:\n\n(name of beach) best place for destination wedding! \n\nglad hubby and I spent time finding the perfect beach! (Name of beach) was the best place for us to married in!\n\nFind pictures of the venue! Post said pictures. Add the caption saying;\n\n(Name of venue) thank you for amazing memories!\n\n\nPost picture of your stuff from vendors! Add the same caption. Thank x vendors for making our day special!\n\nYou get the drift! Make it loud and proud that this was your wedding choices.\n\nWhen your asked why you did this(and you will be) play innocent.  Tell your in-laws that your sil reminded how\nMuch your wedding meant to you and you wanted to show it off!  Be even apologetic! Make it convincing! Even throw in the fact that fil was right you where upset for nothing and it was such a great compliment! So this inspired you to share with other to give them an amazing idea! Say this In your sweet as honey voice\n\nThis way even if sil continues with her plan! She is going to be the laughing stock because her friends will know she put no thought and effort into planning her day.\n\nAnd most importantly if you get invited (after this stunt you may not) make sure you and your husband go! Say things you know I forgot how perfect this beach was when we got married here! When looking at the house say I forgot how spacious this house was when we rented it for our wedding! At the reception make sure you mention how you forgot how good the food was!  When they go do pictures make sure you comment how they won\u2019t be disappointed with that pose! When you did that exact same pose your pictures were perfect! Be loud and proud when remembering everything!\n\nBonus points if you look at a guest and say remember when we were staying here for my wedding we did this and had so much fun! We need to do that again!", "Going against the grain here with NTA.\n\nThe copied wedding destination is pretty weird. Maybe I don't hold weddings in as much sanctity as other people. If you'd be uncomfortable or aggravated or resentful, don't go. You have a right to your feelings.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. I know everyones saying you don\u2019t own a venue, which is correct. but also,,, there is a million other venues, beaches, houses, etc. Photos can be excused because honestly you guys probably didnt do anything out of the ordinary with the poses and they probably mean that they want to pose in the same places/way so they can do a comparison post to show off that its the same place. It\u2019s still weird they didn\u2019t check with you but it\u2019s too late now. \n\nOverall, i believe that you have a right to feel uncomfortable and not want to go after spending so much time and effort just for someone to reclaim that (and learn from any mistakes you made if you had any issues). NTA for not attending, you are free to do that, but I would stop complaining, it will go nowhere and you will burn bridges. they probably spent a lot of money and time recreating everything (you would know how much, just factor out your time/money spent searching and thats how much) and they probably aren\u2019t going to change everything for one/two people. \n\nYou can also take it in stride and also recreate your old wedding photos in regular attendee attire too, like an x-years-later post. (don\u2019t ask the photographer without permission, id just have a friend take the pics) No one would really complain so long as you don\u2019t show up in a wedding dress and your partner in their old attire, that\u2019d be one too many coincidences!", "NTA.

I would feel yucky. My special day and special memories I spent forever planning, being the same as theirs, it take away the sentimentality and specialty of your day x", "Esh - her for being a copy cat, her father for trying to downplay it and enabling/excusing his daughter\u2019s ridiculous behaviour and you for thinking you own a venue/vendors, etc. though I will say she and her father get more of the shame because who copies wedding poses? That is the most bizarre and unoriginal thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Good for you though for not being super petty by going and then just ridiculing the wedding.", "NTA\n\nJust tell them you aren't changing your mind. \nThey can happily do whenever they'd like, but you are going to preserve your memories and not create any bad ones for them, and won't attend.", "NTA. AITA drives me nuts with this \u201cnobody owns a venue\u201d, \u201cnobody owns a name\u201d shit. \n\nDo you own the venue or the vendors? No. Is it weird and rude as hell to use the same venue and vendors as your sibling and basically try to redo their wedding? Yes. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this is a popular local venue, she chose the same exact venue in a different region. She should be embarrassed for being so unoriginal. \n\nAlso, copying someone\u2019s wedding is NOT a compliment in any way and your FIL is an asshole for trying to insult your intelligence and manipulate you that way.", "Hmmmm... I had a lovely backyard wedding, a few marquees up, hired stacks of white chairs, got catering and had a friend of a friend be the barman with an absolute stack of Eskys.  It was excellent and low key.\n\nMy husband's cousin and his partner loved it and they copied it directly a year later, except they held it at his parents property, which was about twenty times bigger and fancier than ours.  I didn't care and was actually happy to have had the idea copied.  I'm still trying to sell how good a non traditional wedding is to people.\n\nYour one, they are using the exact same location.and stuff,  but it's been FIVE YEARS.  There's probably been hundreds of weddings since at that spot.  Anyone else who goes to both won't remember, or at least not enough to compare.    I'm with your FIL and calling it a compliment too.

Get over it and stop making enemies with family over stupid crap!", "[removed]", "YTA. There are only so many wedding venues and suppliers to go around, and you don't have exclusive use of yours. You could be pleased that people enjoyed your wedding so much they want to use the same place.

You're being ridiculous.", "YTA no one can \"override your memories\". You and your husband have already had your own experience there. You don't get to gatekeep the venue.

And to refuse to go to someone else\u2019s wedding in your husband\u2019s family because you think you\u2019re punishing them, kind of sounds petty and jealous.

While her choice seems a bit strange, your reaction is melodramatic & sounds more like a teenage freak out over a similar prom dress than something a fully grown adult should be worrying about", "yta who cares if she is copying it you aint that special get a life.", "YTA good grief. No wedding anywhere is unique at this point,only the people in it. You could have had a lovely time reminiscing about how great your wedding was. You could have taken a series of wonderful 'Us, 5 years later' photos.\n\nInstead you make a child of yourself by being annoyed that someone else wanted a wedding as nice as yours. Frankly, you sound like hard work.", "YTA  yes it\u2019s weird but they can choose where they want to get married", "YTA. As numerous people have said you don\u2019t own any of the vendors, the beach or rental home. Your wedding was 5 years ago and no one can steal your memories away or make them any less valid. And I agree that there\u2019s some exaggerating on the photo poses. That sounds ridiculous, but even if she is, you can\u2019t gatekeep those either. \n\nYou\u2019re choosing to stress the relationship with the entire family because SiL is copying your wedding. Seems childish & like you\u2019re insecure. \n\nDo I find it a little odd? Yes, but she/they clearly loved your ideas. And she/they don\u2019t need you or your husband\u2019s permission or opinion to do so.", "YTA and you\u2019re being really petty refusing to go because someone \u201ccopied\u201d your wedding from 5 years ago. I\u2019m sure people get married at that venue all the time, you can\u2019t dibs it indefinitely. \n\nAlso it\u2019s going to be completely different because they are a different couple and will have different guests. This will ultimately lead to a different experience. Peoples memories aren\u2019t like vhs tapes, no one is going to delete yours for this one. \n\nYou\u2019ve also made this sound like she\u2019s copied every aspect, but yeah obviously the same venue is going to be in the same state and on the same beach, I feel like you\u2019re trying to make it sound worse. As for the photographs, if you look up any wedding venue all the photos are going to be very similar because that\u2019s the ideal spot at those venues. \n\nHonestly you need to get over yourselves, your wedding was so long ago and other people are allowed to have good experiences too. You should take it as a compliment that your SIL loved it so much she wanted to go there too.", "Yta.", "YTA. You don\u2019t support the wedding. Which is 1 day. So now what, are you going to see them at other events and hate them for life\u2014because you OWN memories?", "YTA \n\nYour response is very childish. There is no way her wedding can override your memories. People are having weddings at that same destination venue on a regular basis.", "YTA. Get over it, if you don't like her and don't want a good relationship moving forward with your husbands family, than go for it. 3 of my 4 sisters (including myself) all got married at the same venue, same caterer. Guess what? No one gave a crap. All of our photos looked different bc we all have different taste with colors/style. And a beach is a damn beach. Are you the only ones allowed to have a beach wedding? Lol. The outer banks is an amazing place, go have a great week and relive the memories of your wedding.", "YTA. Five years have passed. Who cares? Why are you so bothered by this? Do you think that the guests are going to remember your wedding and think less of it somehow? If not, do you feel like attending will make you think less of your own wedding? I just don't understand what \"overriding our memories\" means. That's just word salad. They get to choose their own venue, vendors, etc. Take it as a compliment, and try to get over yourself.", "You were married FIVE years ago and you want to keep ownership of every place and every merchant that was involved in your wedding? Do you expect your sister-in-law to not invite any guest who went to your wedding as well? Grow up, OP. YTA.", "YTA.  You don't own wedding venues.  You don't own the beach.  I would take it as a compliment that she chose what you did.  You are being very petty here.  You should apologize for being self absorbed and attend the wedding.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Hate to be one to tell you this but aren't the only person to ever get married at that place", "Nah this would annoy me because why would u copy everything .. u can choose the same venue but personalize it", "NAH. Others are right, you don\u2019t own the venue and can\u2019t gate keep who gets married there or how they set it up. But I do get why you\u2019re upset about it. It\u2019s no longer a special place just for you and your husband. And yes, it\u2019s a wedding venue, lots of people get married there. But generally speaking it\u2019s not someone you know and almost certainly not someone in the immediate family so it does feel like it goes against unwritten social rules.", "Father in law is correct that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married.\nAnd you have the right to decline attending said wedding.", "I don\u2019t understand why you think that just because they are marrying at the same place they will be overriding your memories. Your day was your day and that can\u2019t be changed. To act as if you own the locale take it over the line to YTA.", "You and your husband sound to immature to be married. \n\nYou're not going to his sister's wedding because it's in the same place, etc.\n\nsmdh...YES! YTA...grow up    You could have even made it into some sort of family tradition but that would be to easy, right?", "YTA. Who cares? It\u2019s a compliment to you that you found a nice spot for your wedding. Get over yourself and be happy for the couple.", "YTA", "Yta. Is it strange, absolutely but it can also be viewed as a compliment. How you even know what exact poses & such is a little strange too but whatever. It may get under my skin a little  but if you allow it to taint any of your memories than it\u2019s you being ridiculous because even if she had the same dress & same bridesmaids, it\u2019s her day. You alrdy had yours. Why would it bother you if she used some of your ideas (or even all)?! Yours alrdy happened, nothing is taken from your day or your memories. Even if she was so in love with your wedding that she has to copy it. It\u2019s a form of flattery when someone does that. You don\u2019t own the venue or the vendors & to be honest, when she booked the venue, she probably went w the same vendors because they are in that area & she obviously like their services (may have nothing to do w you at all).", "YTA. How does this in any way change anything about your wedding. Before destination weddings, this happened all of the time. Same church. Same reception location. Same band etc. Even generations apart. You sound like a prima donna. They obviously thought it was beautiful. JUST STOP.", "YTA. Who cares? You don't own the place. It's really a stretch to say they are overriding your memories", "YTA\n\nThe poses part is weird. Not sure what you meant by this / if it was an exaggeration. I can understand same locations (as they are likely recommended/best for the location) but actual posing of the humans is weird.\n\nThe rest of it just means that she loved those parts of your wedding. It\u2019s also flattering to know your choices aren\u2019t out of date five years later.\n\nI\u2019ve got family from a smaller town so have attended numerous weddings and events at the same location using the same vendors. Most guests won\u2019t remember the detail the way you will - you\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time planning the detail, everyone else just rocks up and has a good time. The ones who will actually remember the smaller details are the ones who will also remember whose wedding they were attending.\n\nIf it had only been a short while since your wedding, I\u2019d maybe look for another location, but five years is a long time.\n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s not worth damaging your and your husband\u2019s relationship with his family.", "YTA. I thought this was a girl marrying your husband\u2019s brother, but no\u2026this young lady actually attended your wedding and admires you and her brother so much she wants to mimic you. And maybe she is lazy or maybe she suffers from severe anxiety, so copied your wedding. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s pretty materialistic to say this is going to override your own memories of your wedding. That was your special day so your memories should be firmly in place. If you\u2019re worried about whether *other* people are going to remember her wedding instead of yours, who cares? If they cared enough about you and hubs to travel to your wedding, that\u2019s what is important. \n\nI agree with your FIL.", "Your wedding was 5 years ago?! \n\nYTA. Get over yourself. There are other people.", "YTA you don't own the destination, the beach or the vendors. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Who cares?", "YTA - I\u2019m certain your SIL doesn\u2019t know what poses the photographer will suggest - that crossed the line. Have you never seen or been to a wedding and thought \u2018this is beautiful! I\u2019d love to get married here\u2019 your SIL has. She probably has very fond memories of that week. It might not have even been suggested to her by other family members. \n\nNow if SIL really does completely copy you with the same dresses, flowers, etc that\u2019ll be strange - but using the same venue? Not remotely. \n\nPlease don\u2019t make her wedding about yours. whoever you\u2019ve spoken to about this you should call and make amends before you fracture your family.", "Get the fuck over yourselves. \n\nYTA", "As someone who had a wedding and has attended many weddings: Friendly reminder that no one really cares that much about your wedding.  The people that attend just care that they get good food and drinks, and they of course care about you and your spouse in a generally loving way. That\u2019s literally it.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! Maybe she was so impressed with your wedding, she wanted the same for herself; how many others have booked that venue since your wedding (as others have said, you don't own it)? Instead of gushing with her about the place, you did...this; seems that the problem you have is that you know her. YTA. Get over yourself!\ud83d\udc40", "YTA.  Just grow up.  You should be flattered they thought your wedding was an inspiration.", "YTA. Your wedding is over, she can\u2019t \u201coverride your memories\u201d. If anything it\u2019s an excuse to walk down memory lane together revisiting this venue and catching up with your vendors. Is what she\u2019s doing really weird and tacky? Yup. But maybe she typically has terrible taste and remembered how great your wedding was. Just show up and shut down anyone who tries to make comments comparing the two weddings.", "YTA Hundreds of people have probably had the same venue without the weddings being identical.  The fact that your wedding went well is a reference for the place and the vendors. I very much doubt that the details will be exactly the same.  5 years from now almost no one will remember the wedding or look at the pictures.  But they'll remember that you sulked and refused to attend. You're the one who won't come off well.", "ESH. you don't own the state or the venue. Yeah it sucks she's copying but most weddings are pretty much the same thing so I guess she was inspired by what you did and liked it so much she wants the same. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not going to diminish your memories of your own wedding. You have your own pictures and your own memories that you made with your husband. Let It Go. What you could do is go and treat it like a second honeymoon for you and your husband and have a good time. Heck you can always be a jerk to her and say oh can we renew our vows while you're getting married I'm sure she'd love that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure this is rage bait, but on the off chance it isn\u2019t. \n\nThis is dumb as hell! \n\nMy sister, brother, cousin, whoever, could have copied my wedding to the very last detail, and I wouldn\u2019t give a shit. \n\nBecause it still wouldn\u2019t be MY wedding. That lives in my memory forever. My wedding was where I got to marry the love of my life. When we started our life together. \n\nIf you care more about \u201cbeing the only person\u201d who ever used that beach, or venue, or photographer. Then honey, you got married for the all thewrong reasons!", "YTA. Mimicry is the sincerest form of flattery. You did it well and they want the same thing, why you gotta be a hater? \n\nYou could totally use the opportunity to have an anniversary celebration with yourselves and revisit the place that you had such good memories, and share in that with your family.", "Yeah. It would creep me out a little. More so when they move right into your neighbourhood, and start giving their kids the same names as yours.", "NTA, she is.\n\nSure, you don't own the venue, the beach, blah blah blah whatever. But to copy someone else's wedding, particularly to this extent, is a rude AH move. Like, come up with your own ideas!", "Nta. This is not the same as someone happening to use the same vendors and venue because there are only a few options in their small town. This is someone going very far out of their way to mimic another person. Unless this venue has some kind of significance or tie to the family, this is just plain bizarre and creepy.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if people in this thread appreciate that planning a wedding is a lot of work. I think everyone would be annoyed to have someone copying them but it's extra insulting when they are also taking advantage of the effort you put in to make your event a unique and memorable experience. There's a reason why cribbing off the kid next to you is a crummy thing to do", "It's weird, that's fucking weird. \n\nI don't know if YTA, but it's fucking weird as shit.", "Not one person is saying she\u2019s NTA?! She planned all this ahead of it\u2026 and her SIL goes and copies EVERYTHING. Of course she doesn\u2019t own the venue but why is everything where she planned for it? Weird.", "NAH. You never said you own anything, I\u2019m not sure why everyone is using this strawman. \n\nIt IS bizarre she\u2019s copying your wedding, and it would be normal you both feel bad enough that you don\u2019t want to go. \n\nNo one is obligated to go to anyone\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s the real question.", "NTA, tell them you've already been to that wedding, and wish them the best. \n\nEveryone saying you don't \"own\" the venue is right, but also, you don't have to go either. You dont even need reason. You're not gonna have fun and you'll resent them to their face, which won't be fun for anyone. Don't go.\n\nHer wedding will not be exactly like yours no matter how much she copies yours, though. She's taking the lazy way out of planning, and that will be obvious in how little effort she puts in behind the scenes.", "ESH. But I have to say that 2 of my siblings and I had our weddings at the same church and reception venue with the exact same meal. They were each different because the people were different- your friends are not her friends, etc. Just suck it up. P.S. my husband and I once spent a weekend at the place where he went on his honeymoon with his first wife. All weekend,  I kept saying, \u201c oh honey, is this where the magic happened?\u201d Hahaha", "Your wedding was YOUR wedding.  You should feel either proud that you did such a good job she wants to copy you OR feel sorry for her because she is copying you and being so lazy about it.  \n\nI think YTA for getting SO upset about something that is NOT YOUR WEDDING and will never replace your wedding.  I think you need to sit down for a bit and consider if this is the hill you want to die on with  your family.", "Yes\u2026", "Yall are both petty af. Grow up. Esh", "ESH\n\nCopying your wedding is a pretty shitty thing to do, but what makes you think your wedding is completely original?\n\nThe fact you found that place with people already there to provide all the services you wanted says the place is a common wedding spot, and there's a higher than likely chance everything you did at your wedding has been done before in the exact same way you chose to do it since very few weddings are truly original.", "It could be construed as a *lovely compliment*; unfortunately I think you\u2019ve lost the chance to gush repeatedly to her and everyone in hearing distance that you\u2019re so overwhelmed that she loved your event SO much that she had to recreate every last detail, and how thankful you are to have the chance to revisit such wonderful memories \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. I doubt your husband really agrees with you.", "Seems weird but in the end the only one that really remember or care about any detail of your wedding is you.\n\nIf you go you will be surprised at how many dual invitees dont even remember the venue\n\nIf you decide not to go, while i think most people will agree its weird, i wouldnt expect much outrage empathy sympathy support since again most people only care about their own weddings and will barely remember yours from 5 yrs ago.", "Yep. She loved it so much she wants to go again.", "Everyone attending will know it\u2019s a copy of your wedding as they\u2019ve already been there done that. Sad they don\u2019t have any originality but you should attend and look smug about it. Say politely you had just as good a time as the last time you did it", "Why not take it as a compliment instead of being offended. She thought your wedding was beautiful. Be happy that it was.", "Yeah YTA, how can another wedding in the same location override the memories of your own wedding?", "You can\u2019t copyright a wedding, princess. Relax yourself and be nice", "YTA  just for having main character syndrome. Why do you think YOUR wedding was so important? Just a heads up the family is telling you it\u2019s childish, because no one gives a shit about YOUR special day. Learn to deal with not being the center of attention", "YTA, FIL is right.", "So what? It\u2019s five years later. YTA", "The audacity to have a photographer like you guys did.  They better not have a cake.  Oh man do you think they will exchange vows too?  I bet those bastards will even make rings a part of the ceremony.  The nerve to copy you like that!  YTA clown shoes.  And this is fake, they might have suggested that they liked your venue and you decided to create this fictional scenario", "YTA like yeah it\u2019s kinda wierd but \u201cover riding your memories\u201d is SO dramatic", "YTA - grow up. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Boycotting your husband\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding is going to cause a serious rift in his family and I guarantee HE isn\u2019t upset. You are being a spoiled brat and your FIL is 100% right. And guess what? No one at the wedding is going to care that you aren\u2019t there - they will all be having a blast and talking about what a brat you are.", "If you would be pouting at their wedding, just stay home. \nYTA", "YTA.  If this is the biggest problem you ever have, you\u2019ll live a charmed life.", "So bc someone booked a venue that place is no longer able to be In the wedding business.

Whatever.", "Wow you sound tiresome.", "YTA\u2026overriding your memories\u2026LOL.  You should be flattered beyond belief that she thought your wedding was perfect and wants the same for herself.  You are being petty and jealous and childish.  You don\u2019t own the venue or the beach.  Go to the wedding, be nice, and have a genuinely good time.", "YTA, she obviously thought highly of your wedding. If in your own mind it was the perfect wedding, why are you so offended that she agrees? Why should she compromise on less than what she thought was the ideal wedding?\n\nSo now you are going to stay home rather than return to where you were married and had the chance with your husband to reminisce? And you also won't help family in celebration of the newly married couple.\n\nYou seem to be narcissistic and cold.", "OMG more stupid wedding trauma.", "Gotta wonder\u2026is she having the same color scheme, the same style dress and bridesmaids dresses, the same number in the bridal party, the same floral arrangements, the same cake, the same meal, the same music, the same first dance song.  No?  Then get over yourself.\n\nYTA.  Believe me when I tell you that five years after your wedding, no one but you has more than the vaguest of memories of the venue, the vendors or the wedding poses.  Sorry to be harsh, but no one is overriding your memories.  If your memories of your wedding day are so easily overridden, you have bigger issues to worry about.  \n\nIt\u2019s probably a good thing you\u2019re staying home.

Once you put all that together, every guest who attended had a front row view of what a destination wedding there could be and if they really enjoyed it they might give it a go for themselves or family/friends. I'm sure your SIL will have her own spin on things.  Just go and enjoy it.  You liked it enough to have your wedding there.  I think it would be romantic for you and your husband.  Try looking at it from that view instead of a negative way.\n\nThe couple  enjoyed it so much they are planning to do the very same destination, venue, house. As your FIL says, Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  You planned such a wonderful wedding that your SIL wants the same for herself. It doesn't take anything away from you.  Are you saying nobody else should be allowed to have that same venue?  Or just anyone who went to your wedding? This could become a family tradition. Others may follow suit. \n\nCome on OP, lighten up a bit. What made your wedding truly special was the joining of you and your husband in matrimony.  Don't cheapen it by making it all about where it was held.  Your SIL will never over ride your wedding.  Nothing is ever exactly the same.

They loved your wedding so much, they want to experience it themselves. If you don\u2019t want to go, you also don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation so just don\u2019t go. I wouldn\u2019t dwell on this.", "I think I'm leaning towards YTA because this is all so stupid to me lol Yes, I think it's a little weird to want to even get married in the same location but it must have been a really nice wedding. I'm sure the vendors she chose were not only that they were yours but also they're probably recommended for that specific location...same with the photographer. As long as she isn't planning on wearing your wedding dress lol I don't see why you wouldn't want to go? Seems like they enjoyed the area, food, photographer, scenery, etc. and want to make it their spot as well. You're not the only people that have gotten married there. It doesn't \"override\" your wedding or take your memories away. It might even be neat to go back and have a special date with your husband to reminisce about your wedding and  make new memories. And if you and your husband are too upset to go just stay home. Have that be the end of it though. If you're not going to go, don't complain, don't be rude, don't even talk about it.

My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal. I need to know AITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because it gets rented out, for weddings, for anyone who wants it. You don\u2019t get some weird claim to it just cause you got married there, especially when your wedding was 5 years ago. If anything, you should be flattered they liked your wedding so much that they just copied you. Not only that, but since you had your family come to your wedding, when they show up to hers they\u2019ll realize she did the same thing you did instead of coming up with literally anything to make hers different from yours.

I already responded before, but I need to make a separate post here laying out my thoughts about this situation:\n\n1) This is a destination wedding. It would be different if OP and SIL lived in the same town and there were only a few nice venues to choose from in that town. It is extremely odd that SIL is choosing the exact same destination wedding as OP, and even the same house/venue. SIL has every right to copy OP, and yes, OP doesn't \"own\" this location or venue, but it is crazy that she is doing it in the first place when it's so specific.\n\n2) This is a super close relationship to OP--literally her husband's sister. If it were a friend that did the copying and the guest list would be very different, then I could understand it more, but this is a HOUSE, so probably a small group, and about 1/2 the guests (or more) will be the same as OP's wedding.\n\n3) OP states that they were not asked about/notified beforehand. I think OP may feel differently if SIL and future BIL had come to her and hubby beforehand and said how much they loved their wedding and how they would like to do the same thing because it was such a wonderful day or whatever--that would have been much more respectful and just kind. Again, yes, SIL can do whatever she wants, nor does she need OP's \"permission\", but with how close the relationship is and that it is literally the same place it would have been a lot more considerate to at least acknowledge OP beforehand.\n\n4) Since OP's husband is in support of her for not wanting to attend, and based on some of OP's responses, I am wondering if this is a pattern of disrespect and competitive behavior from hubby's family. It feels like trying to \"rewrite\" or \"outshine\" OP. Diminishing what was probably a lovely wedding. Maybe it isn't and SIL just doesnt want to go to the work of planning her own thing, but even then you don't have to literally copy OP. There are thousands of options that are not straight copy and paste.\n\nSIL and hubby's family are hella weird for pulling this.  I do think maybe OP is taking it too far not attending, however. I personally would take the high road and let people draw their own conclusions about SIL's choices. But I think her feelings about how weird this situation is are valid. And if hubby doesn't want to go, it's his family at the end of the day and he sets the tone.\n\nsoft NTA.", "YTA - sure it\u2019s a weird, but she\u2019s really not taking anything from you.
