My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal. I need to know AITA?

Your memories have nothing to do with the house, the outer banks, or the vendors. If those are what you took away from the wedding, that\u2019s pretty damn shallow. You do not have a monopoly on any aspect of your wedding. Conversely, it sounds as though it was lovely.

Your wedding was 5 years ago, it won\u2019t be the exact same as your day was and I guarantee you other people probably don\u2019t remember every single detail from your day.

My husband and I were married in August, and she and her husband were married in November. Same venue, same music, same flowers, same menu, everything. I can\u2019t say I was ever annoyed with it, but it just seemed very, very strange. I never said anything to anyone about it to anyone except my husband, and he told me I should find it flattering. Several people at the reception took me aside and said things along the lines of, \u201cThese were your ideas first, and it was lovely.\u201d  I suggest you go to the wedding and take the higher ground.

That may work well when you type it on the internet, but in real life people can and will think it's weird af if someone else in the family copies literally everything unless it was approved by the original couple.

Reading a bit more, I get it because some ppl wanna have a wedding but just can\u2019t be bothered to plan anything or be original (weddings are all the same to me btw) so it IS flattering. Regardless, you don\u2019t have to attend any weddings you don\u2019t want to attend and if this is going to make you do (or want to do) something to ruin SIL\u2019s day then don\u2019t go.

Yes, it's weird that she's copying your wedding. But it's a copy. Her wedding album will not be in your house. The memories of her wedding won't override the memories of your wedding.

I have drink a bottle of wine so this could be good!\n\n\n\nDiplomatic answer is that yes it is an asshole move but fil is right! you do not have the copyright to the venue and beach. They have the right to be lazy and use your plans. It will not take away from the memories you made because when you did your wedding it was unique and interesting. Hers is going to be the been there done that version. People will judge her.l am silently judging her for this and I don\u2019t know her! She will be talked about!\n\nNot for the petty version. If you don\u2019t have social media get on a platform. Preferably one that all the guest sil will invite are on. Start posting wedding pictures. With captions! Such as:\n\n(name of beach) best place for destination wedding! \n\nglad hubby and I spent time finding the perfect beach! (Name of beach) was the best place for us to married in!\n\nFind pictures of the venue! Post said pictures. Add the caption saying;\n\n(Name of venue) thank you for amazing memories!\n\n\nPost picture of your stuff from vendors! Add the same caption. Thank x vendors for making our day special!\n\nYou get the drift! Make it loud and proud that this was your wedding choices.\n\nWhen your asked why you did this(and you will be) play innocent.  Tell your in-laws that your sil reminded how\nMuch your wedding meant to you and you wanted to show it off!  Be even apologetic! Make it convincing! Even throw in the fact that fil was right you where upset for nothing and it was such a great compliment! So this inspired you to share with other to give them an amazing idea! Say this In your sweet as honey voice\n\nThis way even if sil continues with her plan! She is going to be the laughing stock because her friends will know she put no thought and effort into planning her day.\n\nAnd most importantly if you get invited (after this stunt you may not) make sure you and your husband go! Say things you know I forgot how perfect this beach was when we got married here! When looking at the house say I forgot how spacious this house was when we rented it for our wedding! At the reception make sure you mention how you forgot how good the food was!  When they go do pictures make sure you comment how they won\u2019t be disappointed with that pose! When you did that exact same pose your pictures were perfect! Be loud and proud when remembering everything!\n\nBonus points if you look at a guest and say remember when we were staying here for my wedding we did this and had so much fun! We need to do that again!", "Going against the grain here with NTA.\n\nThe copied wedding destination is pretty weird. Maybe I don't hold weddings in as much sanctity as other people. If you'd be uncomfortable or aggravated or resentful, don't go. You have a right to your feelings.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. I know everyones saying you don\u2019t own a venue, which is correct. but also,,, there is a million other venues, beaches, houses, etc. Photos can be excused because honestly you guys probably didnt do anything out of the ordinary with the poses and they probably mean that they want to pose in the same places/way so they can do a comparison post to show off that its the same place. It\u2019s still weird they didn\u2019t check with you but it\u2019s too late now. \n\nOverall, i believe that you have a right to feel uncomfortable and not want to go after spending so much time and effort just for someone to reclaim that (and learn from any mistakes you made if you had any issues). NTA for not attending, you are free to do that, but I would stop complaining, it will go nowhere and you will burn bridges. they probably spent a lot of money and time recreating everything (you would know how much, just factor out your time/money spent searching and thats how much) and they probably aren\u2019t going to change everything for one/two people. \n\nYou can also take it in stride and also recreate your old wedding photos in regular attendee attire too, like an x-years-later post. (don\u2019t ask the photographer without permission, id just have a friend take the pics) No one would really complain so long as you don\u2019t show up in a wedding dress and your partner in their old attire, that\u2019d be one too many coincidences!", "NTA.

That is the most bizarre and unoriginal thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Good for you though for not being super petty by going and then just ridiculing the wedding.", "NTA\n\nJust tell them you aren't changing your mind. \nThey can happily do whenever they'd like, but you are going to preserve your memories and not create any bad ones for them, and won't attend.", "NTA. AITA drives me nuts with this \u201cnobody owns a venue\u201d, \u201cnobody owns a name\u201d shit. \n\nDo you own the venue or the vendors? No. Is it weird and rude as hell to use the same venue and vendors as your sibling and basically try to redo their wedding? Yes. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this is a popular local venue, she chose the same exact venue in a different region. She should be embarrassed for being so unoriginal. \n\nAlso, copying someone\u2019s wedding is NOT a compliment in any way and your FIL is an asshole for trying to insult your intelligence and manipulate you that way.", "Hmmmm... I had a lovely backyard wedding, a few marquees up, hired stacks of white chairs, got catering and had a friend of a friend be the barman with an absolute stack of Eskys.  It was excellent and low key.\n\nMy husband's cousin and his partner loved it and they copied it directly a year later, except they held it at his parents property, which was about twenty times bigger and fancier than ours.  I didn't care and was actually happy to have had the idea copied.  I'm still trying to sell how good a non traditional wedding is to people.\n\nYour one, they are using the exact same location.and stuff,  but it's been FIVE YEARS.  There's probably been hundreds of weddings since at that spot.  Anyone else who goes to both won't remember, or at least not enough to compare.    I'm with your FIL and calling it a compliment too.

And to refuse to go to someone else\u2019s wedding in your husband\u2019s family because you think you\u2019re punishing them, kind of sounds petty and jealous.

As numerous people have said you don\u2019t own any of the vendors, the beach or rental home. Your wedding was 5 years ago and no one can steal your memories away or make them any less valid. And I agree that there\u2019s some exaggerating on the photo poses. That sounds ridiculous, but even if she is, you can\u2019t gatekeep those either. \n\nYou\u2019re choosing to stress the relationship with the entire family because SiL is copying your wedding. Seems childish & like you\u2019re insecure. \n\nDo I find it a little odd? Yes, but she/they clearly loved your ideas. And she/they don\u2019t need you or your husband\u2019s permission or opinion to do so.", "YTA and you\u2019re being really petty refusing to go because someone \u201ccopied\u201d your wedding from 5 years ago. I\u2019m sure people get married at that venue all the time, you can\u2019t dibs it indefinitely. \n\nAlso it\u2019s going to be completely different because they are a different couple and will have different guests. This will ultimately lead to a different experience. Peoples memories aren\u2019t like vhs tapes, no one is going to delete yours for this one. \n\nYou\u2019ve also made this sound like she\u2019s copied every aspect, but yeah obviously the same venue is going to be in the same state and on the same beach, I feel like you\u2019re trying to make it sound worse. As for the photographs, if you look up any wedding venue all the photos are going to be very similar because that\u2019s the ideal spot at those venues. \n\nHonestly you need to get over yourselves, your wedding was so long ago and other people are allowed to have good experiences too. You should take it as a compliment that your SIL loved it so much she wanted to go there too.", "Yta.", "YTA. You don\u2019t support the wedding. Which is 1 day. So now what, are you going to see them at other events and hate them for life\u2014because you OWN memories?", "YTA \n\nYour response is very childish. There is no way her wedding can override your memories. People are having weddings at that same destination venue on a regular basis.", "YTA. Get over it, if you don't like her and don't want a good relationship moving forward with your husbands family, than go for it. 3 of my 4 sisters (including myself) all got married at the same venue, same caterer. Guess what? No one gave a crap. All of our photos looked different bc we all have different taste with colors/style. And a beach is a damn beach. Are you the only ones allowed to have a beach wedding? Lol. The outer banks is an amazing place, go have a great week and relive the memories of your wedding.", "YTA. Five years have passed. Who cares? Why are you so bothered by this? Do you think that the guests are going to remember your wedding and think less of it somehow? If not, do you feel like attending will make you think less of your own wedding? I just don't understand what \"overriding our memories\" means. That's just word salad. They get to choose their own venue, vendors, etc. Take it as a compliment, and try to get over yourself.", "You were married FIVE years ago and you want to keep ownership of every place and every merchant that was involved in your wedding? Do you expect your sister-in-law to not invite any guest who went to your wedding as well? Grow up, OP. YTA.", "YTA.  You don't own wedding venues.  You don't own the beach.  I would take it as a compliment that she chose what you did.  You are being very petty here.  You should apologize for being self absorbed and attend the wedding.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Hate to be one to tell you this but aren't the only person to ever get married at that place", "Nah this would annoy me because why would u copy everything .. u can choose the same venue but personalize it", "NAH. Others are right, you don\u2019t own the venue and can\u2019t gate keep who gets married there or how they set it up. But I do get why you\u2019re upset about it. It\u2019s no longer a special place just for you and your husband. And yes, it\u2019s a wedding venue, lots of people get married there. But generally speaking it\u2019s not someone you know and almost certainly not someone in the immediate family so it does feel like it goes against unwritten social rules.", "Father in law is correct that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married.\nAnd you have the right to decline attending said wedding.", "I don\u2019t understand why you think that just because they are marrying at the same place they will be overriding your memories. Your day was your day and that can\u2019t be changed. To act as if you own the locale take it over the line to YTA.", "You and your husband sound to immature to be married. \n\nYou're not going to his sister's wedding because it's in the same place, etc.\n\nsmdh...YES! YTA...grow up    You could have even made it into some sort of family tradition but that would be to easy, right?", "YTA. Who cares? It\u2019s a compliment to you that you found a nice spot for your wedding. Get over yourself and be happy for the couple.", "YTA", "Yta. Is it strange, absolutely but it can also be viewed as a compliment. How you even know what exact poses & such is a little strange too but whatever. It may get under my skin a little  but if you allow it to taint any of your memories than it\u2019s you being ridiculous because even if she had the same dress & same bridesmaids, it\u2019s her day. You alrdy had yours. Why would it bother you if she used some of your ideas (or even all)?! Yours alrdy happened, nothing is taken from your day or your memories. Even if she was so in love with your wedding that she has to copy it. It\u2019s a form of flattery when someone does that. You don\u2019t own the venue or the vendors & to be honest, when she booked the venue, she probably went w the same vendors because they are in that area & she obviously like their services (may have nothing to do w you at all).", "YTA. How does this in any way change anything about your wedding. Before destination weddings, this happened all of the time. Same church. Same reception location. Same band etc. Even generations apart. You sound like a prima donna. They obviously thought it was beautiful. JUST STOP.", "YTA. Who cares? You don't own the place. It's really a stretch to say they are overriding your memories", "YTA\n\nThe poses part is weird. Not sure what you meant by this / if it was an exaggeration. I can understand same locations (as they are likely recommended/best for the location) but actual posing of the humans is weird.\n\nThe rest of it just means that she loved those parts of your wedding. It\u2019s also flattering to know your choices aren\u2019t out of date five years later.\n\nI\u2019ve got family from a smaller town so have attended numerous weddings and events at the same location using the same vendors. Most guests won\u2019t remember the detail the way you will - you\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time planning the detail, everyone else just rocks up and has a good time. The ones who will actually remember the smaller details are the ones who will also remember whose wedding they were attending.\n\nIf it had only been a short while since your wedding, I\u2019d maybe look for another location, but five years is a long time.\n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s not worth damaging your and your husband\u2019s relationship with his family.", "YTA. I thought this was a girl marrying your husband\u2019s brother, but no\u2026this young lady actually attended your wedding and admires you and her brother so much she wants to mimic you. And maybe she is lazy or maybe she suffers from severe anxiety, so copied your wedding. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s pretty materialistic to say this is going to override your own memories of your wedding. That was your special day so your memories should be firmly in place. If you\u2019re worried about whether *other* people are going to remember her wedding instead of yours, who cares? If they cared enough about you and hubs to travel to your wedding, that\u2019s what is important. \n\nI agree with your FIL.", "Your wedding was 5 years ago?! \n\nYTA. Get over yourself. There are other people.", "YTA you don't own the destination, the beach or the vendors. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Who cares?", "YTA - I\u2019m certain your SIL doesn\u2019t know what poses the photographer will suggest - that crossed the line. Have you never seen or been to a wedding and thought \u2018this is beautiful! I\u2019d love to get married here\u2019 your SIL has. She probably has very fond memories of that week. It might not have even been suggested to her by other family members. \n\nNow if SIL really does completely copy you with the same dresses, flowers, etc that\u2019ll be strange - but using the same venue? Not remotely. \n\nPlease don\u2019t make her wedding about yours. whoever you\u2019ve spoken to about this you should call and make amends before you fracture your family.", "Get the fuck over yourselves. \n\nYTA", "As someone who had a wedding and has attended many weddings: Friendly reminder that no one really cares that much about your wedding.  The people that attend just care that they get good food and drinks, and they of course care about you and your spouse in a generally loving way. That\u2019s literally it.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! Maybe she was so impressed with your wedding, she wanted the same for herself; how many others have booked that venue since your wedding (as others have said, you don't own it)? Instead of gushing with her about the place, you did...this; seems that the problem you have is that you know her. YTA. Get over yourself!\ud83d\udc40", "YTA.  Just grow up.  You should be flattered they thought your wedding was an inspiration.", "YTA. Your wedding is over, she can\u2019t \u201coverride your memories\u201d. If anything it\u2019s an excuse to walk down memory lane together revisiting this venue and catching up with your vendors. Is what she\u2019s doing really weird and tacky? Yup. But maybe she typically has terrible taste and remembered how great your wedding was. Just show up and shut down anyone who tries to make comments comparing the two weddings.", "YTA Hundreds of people have probably had the same venue without the weddings being identical.  The fact that your wedding went well is a reference for the place and the vendors. I very much doubt that the details will be exactly the same.  5 years from now almost no one will remember the wedding or look at the pictures.  But they'll remember that you sulked and refused to attend. You're the one who won't come off well.", "ESH. you don't own the state or the venue. Yeah it sucks she's copying but most weddings are pretty much the same thing so I guess she was inspired by what you did and liked it so much she wants the same. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not going to diminish your memories of your own wedding. You have your own pictures and your own memories that you made with your husband. Let It Go. What you could do is go and treat it like a second honeymoon for you and your husband and have a good time. Heck you can always be a jerk to her and say oh can we renew our vows while you're getting married I'm sure she'd love that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure this is rage bait, but on the off chance it isn\u2019t. \n\nThis is dumb as hell! \n\nMy sister, brother, cousin, whoever, could have copied my wedding to the very last detail, and I wouldn\u2019t give a shit. \n\nBecause it still wouldn\u2019t be MY wedding. That lives in my memory forever. My wedding was where I got to marry the love of my life. When we started our life together. \n\nIf you care more about \u201cbeing the only person\u201d who ever used that beach, or venue, or photographer. Then honey, you got married for the all thewrong reasons!", "YTA. Mimicry is the sincerest form of flattery. You did it well and they want the same thing, why you gotta be a hater? \n\nYou could totally use the opportunity to have an anniversary celebration with yourselves and revisit the place that you had such good memories, and share in that with your family.", "Yeah. It would creep me out a little. More so when they move right into your neighbourhood, and start giving their kids the same names as yours.", "NTA, she is.\n\nSure, you don't own the venue, the beach, blah blah blah whatever. But to copy someone else's wedding, particularly to this extent, is a rude AH move. Like, come up with your own ideas!", "Nta. This is not the same as someone happening to use the same vendors and venue because there are only a few options in their small town. This is someone going very far out of their way to mimic another person. Unless this venue has some kind of significance or tie to the family, this is just plain bizarre and creepy.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if people in this thread appreciate that planning a wedding is a lot of work. I think everyone would be annoyed to have someone copying them but it's extra insulting when they are also taking advantage of the effort you put in to make your event a unique and memorable experience. There's a reason why cribbing off the kid next to you is a crummy thing to do", "It's weird, that's fucking weird. \n\nI don't know if YTA, but it's fucking weird as shit.", "Not one person is saying she\u2019s NTA?! She planned all this ahead of it\u2026 and her SIL goes and copies EVERYTHING. Of course she doesn\u2019t own the venue but why is everything where she planned for it? Weird.", "NAH. You never said you own anything, I\u2019m not sure why everyone is using this strawman. \n\nIt IS bizarre she\u2019s copying your wedding, and it would be normal you both feel bad enough that you don\u2019t want to go. \n\nNo one is obligated to go to anyone\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s the real question.", "NTA, tell them you've already been to that wedding, and wish them the best. \n\nEveryone saying you don't \"own\" the venue is right, but also, you don't have to go either. You dont even need reason. You're not gonna have fun and you'll resent them to their face, which won't be fun for anyone. Don't go.\n\nHer wedding will not be exactly like yours no matter how much she copies yours, though. She's taking the lazy way out of planning, and that will be obvious in how little effort she puts in behind the scenes.", "ESH. But I have to say that 2 of my siblings and I had our weddings at the same church and reception venue with the exact same meal. They were each different because the people were different- your friends are not her friends, etc. Just suck it up.

All weekend,  I kept saying, \u201c oh honey, is this where the magic happened?\u201d Hahaha", "Your wedding was YOUR wedding.  You should feel either proud that you did such a good job she wants to copy you OR feel sorry for her because she is copying you and being so lazy about it.  \n\nI think YTA for getting SO upset about something that is NOT YOUR WEDDING and will never replace your wedding.  I think you need to sit down for a bit and consider if this is the hill you want to die on with  your family.", "Yes\u2026", "Yall are both petty af. Grow up. Esh", "ESH\n\nCopying your wedding is a pretty shitty thing to do, but what makes you think your wedding is completely original?\n\nThe fact you found that place with people already there to provide all the services you wanted says the place is a common wedding spot, and there's a higher than likely chance everything you did at your wedding has been done before in the exact same way you chose to do it since very few weddings are truly original.", "It could be construed as a *lovely compliment*; unfortunately I think you\u2019ve lost the chance to gush repeatedly to her and everyone in hearing distance that you\u2019re so overwhelmed that she loved your event SO much that she had to recreate every last detail, and how thankful you are to have the chance to revisit such wonderful memories \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. I doubt your husband really agrees with you.", "Seems weird but in the end the only one that really remember or care about any detail of your wedding is you.\n\nIf you go you will be surprised at how many dual invitees dont even remember the venue\n\nIf you decide not to go, while i think most people will agree its weird, i wouldnt expect much outrage empathy sympathy support since again most people only care about their own weddings and will barely remember yours from 5 yrs ago.", "Yep. She loved it so much she wants to go again.", "Everyone attending will know it\u2019s a copy of your wedding as they\u2019ve already been there done that.

Relax yourself and be nice", "YTA  just for having main character syndrome. Why do you think YOUR wedding was so important?

They better not have a cake.  Oh man do you think they will exchange vows too?  I bet those bastards will even make rings a part of the ceremony.  The nerve to copy you like that!  YTA clown shoes.  And this is fake, they might have suggested that they liked your venue and you decided to create this fictional scenario", "YTA like yeah it\u2019s kinda wierd but \u201cover riding your memories\u201d is SO dramatic", "YTA - grow up. Your wedding was 5 years ago. Boycotting your husband\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding is going to cause a serious rift in his family and I guarantee HE isn\u2019t upset.

Are you saying nobody else should be allowed to have that same venue?  Or just anyone who went to your wedding? This could become a family tradition. Others may follow suit. \n\nCome on OP, lighten up a bit. What made your wedding truly special was the joining of you and your husband in matrimony.

I'm sure the vendors she chose were not only that they were yours but also they're probably recommended for that specific location...same with the photographer. As long as she isn't planning on wearing your wedding dress lol I don't see why you wouldn't want to go? Seems like they enjoyed the area, food, photographer, scenery, etc. and want to make it their spot as well. You're not the only people that have gotten married there. It doesn't \"override\" your wedding or take your memories away. It might even be neat to go back and have a special date with your husband to reminisce about your wedding and  make new memories. And if you and your husband are too upset to go just stay home. Have that be the end of it though. If you're not going to go, don't complain, don't be rude, don't even talk about it.

My husband and I live in MI, USA.  5 years ago we chose to have a destination wedding in the Outer Banks, NC. We invited our closest friends and family for a full week of fun to include the ceremony. We spent a year selecting the venue nationally, flying down, meeting with vendors and selected the perfect beachfront to have the reception and ceremony. Yesterday a text message was sent from my sister in law  (who also lives in MI) in a group chat to the entire family announcing that she was now having her own destination wedding, in the same state, on the same beach, at the same house using the same vendors, taking the same photos in the same poses as my husband and I. This was not discussed with my husband and I ahead of time. \n\nMy husband and I told his family that by copying our wedding, they are overriding our memories made there and that it really bothers us. We even found another house for her to book but she refuses to change her venue.  My heart is broken and today we told them we will not be attending. My father in law called me this afternoon and said that his daughter has the right to choose where she wants to get married and that copying another person's wedding was a compliment and no big deal.

They\u2019re not stealing your limelight and your family might even laugh that hey didn\u2019t they already get married here? But when it comes down to it, they are your family and you should support and be happy for them that they are actually getting married and can afford to do it. So what if they use the same venue, so what if they use the same vendors. For the venue and the vendors they\u2019re getting business and that\u2019s how they make a living just so happens instead of it being somebody else coming there it\u2019s someone from your family giving them the repeat business. I say be the bigger person buck up and just be happy for them they showed up for your wedding and we\u2019re happy for you. That\u2019s the least you can do for them. They don\u2019t owe you a discussion on where they plan their wedding or what vendors they\u2019re using.", "YTA. She loved your wedding.  It\u2019s a *wedding*.  If her having the same wedding venue as you ruins your own wedding memories, they must not be very solid, happy memories.  That says a lot about you, and absolutely nothing about her.", "Wow! Nice way to make your ILs hate you. \nBIG AH, your sister in law is lazy and she hasn\u2019t thought that people will talk about your wedding while at her\u2019s.", "Sorry but YTA. It is a bit weird and unimaginative to have a wedding just like yours but I can\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t proud of having such a wonderful wedding that someone else wants to do the same. And you not attending the wedding makes you look petty and rude.", "Overriding your memories?\n\nUhhhh\u2026", "YTA. Anyone can get married there including people you know. Your memories are from an event 5 years ago; your memories can not be overwritten. How many guests will there be there that were also at your wedding? Those people will have fond memories of your wedding. \n\nDon't you think it would be nice to revisit the location in the vein of another family wedding? Your husband and you can plan a secret romantic vow renewal or something a day or 2 before or after SILs wedding. Something special for just the 2 of you, so you can have new memories to go along with your memories from 5 years ago. You could go a little nuts and really do something special.", "Copying another person\u2019s wedding is a huge compliment, and you should shrug, roll your eyes, and get on with it. \n\nHonestly, the things people are prepared to go to war over\u2026..", "YTA. Who cares? \n\nWhat percent of your daily life is spent \u201cremembering\u201d your wedding?  None. \n\nNow divide that by 1000% and that\u2019s how much time everyone else spends.   \n\nWhat people probably remember a really good and fun time spent with people they love, warm feelings about enjoying one another\u2019s company. \n\nWith benefit of the doubt, that\u2019s what they are trying to recreate. Make it a big anniversary trip for the whole family in future - a destination that everyone has good feelings about. \n\nGet over yourself.

I can even understand why you may laugh with your husband about how unoriginal SIL is being and have a whinge to your friends privately\n\nBut it is a compliment that she thought yours was so amazing she will do the same thing whilst slightly odd that everything will be the same and not just the general feel of the wedding. She could be slightly TA for not discussing it but maybe she knew how you would react.\n\nY definitely TA for not attending and making this all about you and your memories. How is it possibly overriding your memories? Are you going to forget you got married and what happened because SIL is having the same wedding?\nHow do other people cope when all the family gets married in their parents back garden or all in the same registry office.

Enjoy yourself.  (Or is your marriage so shallow that you cannot stand comparison?)", "Your father in law is right, you don't own the venue. And I highly doubt that your photo poses are so unique that they haven't been \"copied\" by hundreds of couples getting married.\n\nI also doubt that your wedding plans are so unique & specific. I suspect that what your SIL is actually doing is having her wedding in the same venue. Which, again, will have been the venue for hundreds if not thousands of couples.\n\nYour SIL choosing the same wedding venue is not \"overriding your memories\".  You are not the main character of reality & you need to stop acting like you are.", "YTA. How could someone having a wedding at the same venue ruin your wedding? Seriously. Did she get the same dress, wearing the same underwear, marrying the same man, having the same wedding party. If this is a crazy stalker thing then you have a bigger issue. But lots of people get married in the Outer Banks. Like a lot.\n\nJust say you are not going and move on.", "YTA. You do know wedding venues are typically used for\u2026weddings, right?  You *could* have used that time to have a nice vacation and trip down memory lane but nope.", "Most likely OP is making assumptions because it will be the same photographer. She seems to be making a lot of assumptions.", "I mean, there are only so many coupley wedding photo poses. Shocking that OP would consider any or all of them exclusive to her only.", "Yeah this part told me half of this is in OP\u2019s head. She\u2019s just jealous and delulu because she\u2019s realizing what she thought was her \u201cspecial day\u201d really wasn\u2019t that special.", "IT was 5 years ago, Things would have changed at the venue itself. OP's photos are not going to change irrespective of how many weddings were held at that place and that would be a lot. if her child or grandchild decided to go there would she still have the same objections?", "YTA. Why does it matter what other people do? Your memories are yours and only you decide if and when these shall be overridden...", "Doesn\u2019t pretty much everybody take all the same standard photos? There\u2019s a picture of the bride and groom, a picture of either family, a picture of three bridesmaids and the bride, one of three groomsman and the groom, there\u2019s usually a picture of the flower girl(s) and ring bearer.\n\nLike how the hell do you copy \u201call the same poses?\u201d", "Many poses are standard at every wedding. I mean EVERY wedding. The poses aren\u2019t copyrighted.", "How would sister in law know who all the vendors were 5 years later? And all those vendors are still in business?\n\nstory is fishy, yeah.", "Absolutely. Is she forgetting that until very recently everyone had the same wedding venues? Everyone got married in the church they went to on Sundays and had the reception in the hall in the basement. Being married in the same place as your sister in law is the most normal thing you can do, when you look at human history with a broad lens.", "This should be the top comment.\n\nIf the house, the vendors, the location and the party is all you take from your *weddding*, that marriage is doomed because it was never anything more than \u201cinsert spouse here.\u201d", "There was a time when everyone in a whole town would get married in the same place with the same vendors. OP is a wackadoo", "I agree with all your points and say YTA for the situation but I wouldn't necessarily call this \"grossly self centered\", what the sister is doing is a bit odd to say the least. If my sister chose everything down to the wire exactly the same as mine I'd be a little like, um ok little weird but ok I guess. Like it's something I wouldn't be oblivious to is all I'm saying, and to point it out I don't think it's wrong. To put restrictions or make demands for their wedding ideas not OPs call.", "Exactly. Her wedding was 5 years ago and most guests will remember the venue but not much else. I know a brother and sister that ended up using the same wedding venue within a year (maybe even within 6 months) of each other. I just remember thinking that was odd but that was it. It did make it easier to remember how to get there since it was up in the mountains by Malibu. I couldn\u2019t even recall if anything else was the same and I doubt other guests will too besides remembering the venue.", "He\u2019s the one that said we are not going. Not the first time his family has disrespected his feelings.", "There is definitely history of disrespect from my husband\u2019s family. This just is the added bonus.", "Yeah I'm shocked by the responses here. This is really, really fucking weird. Are people missing that this is a destination wedding? I care less about the memory invalidation and moreso about the weird obsession here. This is not normal at all.", "My husband\u2019s family\u2019s has respected him in the past, I\u2019ve never been accepted by his family, not sure why, maybe because I had a child when I met my husband or maybe because I\u2019m not from the same religious background, either way there has always been tension.", "Actually the point was to see people\u2019s reaction to the idea of redoing someone\u2019s wedding. Which most people agreed is in bad form. Thank you for your comment.", "In a similarly petty note, they could say to the SIL that it was so brave of her to not be worried that her wedding would be overshadowed by everyone comparing it to OP's.\n\nAnd then they could spend the entire time there talking loudly about their own wedding. If they get told off, just say \"oh sorry! We didn't realise! This place just holds so many memories for us!\"", "I hate the whole \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\"\n\nOkay.

SIL and BIL got married at the same venue, using same officiant, photographer, cake maker, DJ and did is two years apart on the same long weekend. I thought it was great - who cares? I had so much fun at my wedding and then I was able to go back and have a ton of fun as a bridesmaid. OP has such a weird take.", "They won\u2019t have the same guest list. OP\u2019s husband\u2019s family will overlap, but SIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s family were presumably not at OP\u2019s wedding, and they must have different friend groups.

I forget most of the details, including details of my siblings weddings. Some I\u2019ve forgotten everything except the fact I was there. I know weddings are very important to those who were wed, which is how it should be. For the rest of us? Meh, not so much. I was tremendously happy for each of the couples whose weddings I attended or participated in. Almost every one of them are still together.

We had a church wedding and the reception was held at a specific venue in a park. Our friends really liked the way it was done, and how well everything went from the setting to the food, so they opted to have their wedding there too. There were difference, like they had a civil ceremony on site, winter versus a summer wedding, but it was in the same function room. They did mention this beforehand and said something like \"we hope you don't mind\" but to be honest - why would I object?\n\nIt was really nice to experience the venue from the other side.

I have had my issues with my own immediate family with the way I was treated by them and how it made me feel. Luckily, they were receptive when I spoke to them about it after a similar incident where I blew up on them. \n\nWorth a shot to talk through it with them first and express why it makes you feel this way instead of just outright refusing to go.

You may be concerned her wedding taking place 5+ years later may end up being nicer than yours, and you don\u2019t want comparisons or to be forgotten as the OG wedding at this location. Get over it. Instead of feeling extremely flattered that your wedding was so lovely that someone else was inspired by it, you\u2019re acting like a spoiled child. You mention also that your husband is upset because his family has disrespected his feelings before. I\u2019m gonna give you both the benefit of the doubt and assume this is why you\u2019re having such a strong reaction to the news. Or perhaps there are other petty jealousies at play on both sides and your anger isn\u2019t just based off the wedding stuff. Because if it is, YTA.

I ONLY believe the issue is the not going, but you're justified in how you feel. I think this is more of a learning lesson about who she is as a person. If the relationship between everyone stays fine I would personally take every opportunity I could if she was with me to repeatedly tell her not to copy you like she did the wedding. I would let her have it, but NOT let her forget.
