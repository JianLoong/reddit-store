They are being horribly selfish.\n\nBesides, nannies get paid a lot more than whatever free rent they might offer.\n\nYour family can kick rocks.", "NTA not your kids not your responsibility.", "NTA. Why should you give up on your live, even working part time to be a free babysitter for your brothers children? Why would they even expect such things? If they really need help this much and have space, they could look for an Au pair who will watch the kids for a few hours a day. \n\nBut no. Defintly NTA . Especially as they don't even think about paying you (as far as I got from your story)", "NTA. You are in no way required to do this for them.  The responsibility for finding and paying for childcare is completely on them.   Stick to your guns. No is a complete sentence.", "This is the easiest NTA I've ever given. Your brother and sister-in-law need to suck it up and pay for help. Maybe not a live-in but at least a babysitter to help out with the older kid when the younger one is born. \n\nThey are responsible for their reproductive choices. I would let them know that you have your own life to live and you can't be responsible for children they chose to have. And then, I would let them know that if they continue to bug about it, they will be blocked.", "Definitely NTA but they are big ones for:\n\n1. Not planning their lives out.\n2. Making their poor choices other people's problems.\n3. Being bossy and manipulative.\n4. Being completely disrespectful to your personal choices and plans for your life.\n5. Using family to further their manipulative ways.\n6. Totally disregarding that you have your own life which you do not wish to rotate around school and THEIR KIDS. \n7. Being totally self centered, self absorbed and selfish. \n\nLive your life OP. Studying and working part time is a fantastic choice, and I wish you the very best.", "NTA.  Just a firm and respectful \"No\" is fine.  You've explained yourself enough.  Silence goes a long way if they push the issue - just don't reply until they handle their own responsibilities.", "NTA. \n\nThey aren\u2019t entitled to free childcare because they have kids very close in age.", "NTA, not your responsibility. Live your life! Don't move in with them. They probably gonna treat you badly/without gratitude and probably with more issues and fights to come when you move in", "Didn't you say that for your plan to go to uni to work, you needed to have a part time paying job?  Wouldn't you have to give up that plan to be their nanny?  \n\nDefinitely NTA.  You can't scrap your plans for your future for them.", "NTA. You said no and that is that. If having help caring for their children is so important to them, they can hire someone.

It's up to them to deal with the consequences.", "NTA - Your brother and SIL are giant assholes for even suggesting this IMO.  \u201cHelping out\u201d would a great thing for you to volunteer\u2026..normally this is an offer of regular support during a set period of time.

I can come by and make dinner a few times a month or help with some chores once a week for the first few months etc.\n\nAny kind of help from a parents perspective is gravy (free shit), only to be balanced out by visitors who don\u2019t do anything but exhaust our social capital.  Your bro and SIL put themselves in the Irish twins situation and will have to make due.  If I were you I\u2019d let them know that help is available on your terms (that you should lay out, if you feel so inclined), or that you don\u2019t really need to be involved at all.\n\nBut for the love of god don\u2019t beat yourself up over this.  They\u2019re the ones who suck here.", "NTA - They need to pay for childcare, they shouldn't try to guilt trip you into sacrificing your life for their choices.", "NTA. The entitled behaviour of them plus also your family is quite outstanding really, it\u2019s hardly like taking care of 2 small children is an easy task and they don\u2019t even want to pay you! They got themselves into this situation I mean seriously getting pregnant immediately after having a baby that\u2019s just stupid. They need to sort out their own problems what if you had a full time job and weren\u2019t going to uni then what would they do?", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are trying to take advantage of you. They do not care about your feelings, needs, or your life, they only care about themselves. Thus the entitlement and mistreatment they\u2019re exhibiting. Their demands and reactions are beyond inappropriate. \n\nYou need to stop engaging with their behavior, and stand up for yourself, be firm. You, as well as anyone with a modicum of sense, clearly knows you are not the AH for refusing to essentially being their unpaid live-in nanny who pays rent (the absurdity of that arrangement defies reason).\n\nDo not throw away your life and future by giving in to them. Do not worry about people who don\u2019t care about you.", "NTA - sorry but family is not entitled to free labor just because they need it. It doesn't work that way.", "NTA - you're free to live your life as you. What they're angry about is not having free childcare available to them.", "NTA, absolutely not your problem that they are having children that close together without a childcare plan.  Everyone who is trying to guilt you can feel free to move in and be their full time servant/unpaid labor.  How ridiculous.", "Easiest NTA, as someone who worked as a live in nanny it's a hard job! To demand you care for their children for free simply because you're family is an insult. Its not like they asked you to watch them occasionally for a date night. You're in your 30s and clearly stated you want to focus on school.", "What on earth??? \n\nNTA AT ALL. They decided to have two children 10 months apart knowing what their support system was and now it falls on them to take care of their children. The sheer entitlement to your time and labor is astounding, and for FREE! And having the gall to be angry at you for refusing this ludicrous demand! Ridiculous. Do not let them guilt you into becoming their free nanny out of \u201cobligation\u201d to their children. Those are THEIR children. That THEY chose to have. Not your circus, not your monkeys. \u201cHelping out\u201d as your parents put it is watching the kids every now and then, picking them up from daycare or a friends house every now and again when the parents are in a bind. It is NOT putting your life and plans on hold and uprooting your entire life system to move into someone else\u2019s house to care for their kids FOR FREE.\n\nYou are someone who has not been in school since they were 16 going to college, it will be hard. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to manage it given you\u2019re an adult who has worked for many years but studying is hard, especially if you haven\u2019t done it in a while. The time it takes up isn\u2019t just the time that you\u2019re actively in classes, the bulk of the work and learning is done outside of them. They are not thinking of you at all and honestly that lack of consideration for others and selfishness at their age is very concerning. Especially for people who are now parents. And paired with the seeming lack of accountability for their choices it really makes me worry for those kids.\n\nYour parents are enabling your brother and SIL\u2019s entitlement. Theirs is not a reasonable request(demand) and if they are so disappointed and concerned that your brother and SIL won\u2019t have a free live in nanny they are free to assume that role themselves. Your brother and SIL need to buck up and come to terms with the fact that they are responsible for their children. And they\u2019d better be quick about it too, the show already started.", "NTA, easily not. They are beyond TAH. The entitlement they're exhibiting is astounding, and that's not counting how insulting it is to expect you to do it for free.", "NTA. \n\nWhat kind of generational BS is THIS?? \nYOU are not responsible for your brother and sister-in-law\u2019s kids, nor to be their nanny, paid or unpaid. \n\nLET THEM BE ANGRY! LET THEM RAGE! FFS! \n\nAnd don\u2019t let them emotionally manipulate you into doing something you do not want to do.", "Of course they are pushing - it\u2019s an amazing deal for them if they can get you to nanny for free as a family member who can be guilted and won\u2019t be as easily able to establish work boundaries. But it\u2019s selfish of them. You do what\u2019s good for you. NTA", "NTA. It sounds like it would be a one-sided relationship with you doing all of the work.", "NTA. They had 9 months to figure out childcare. Their poor planning isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA  \n\nBrother and SIL are angry because they were counting on free babysitter for their kids.    \n\n*How dare you not want to work for free for us! Who cares if you have a plan for your own life?*", "That sounds horrific. Your brother's and SIL's poor planning or precautions does not create an emergency, or obligation, for you.

But yeah, must have the easiest birth in history if she recovered that quickly.", "Happen to my grandmother lol she end up having 2 daughters 10months apart", "Considering this offer I'd say openly laughing in their faces and walking away would be a far more appropriate response.", "It's not even free, they're expecting him to pay rent lol", ">They decided to have two children 10 months apart knowing what their support system was and now it falls on them to take care of their children.\n\nI\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and guess that the second baby was not part of their plan.

Fuck that!\" is more apposite.", "I seriously hope only the brother is drunk", "oops NTA", "You would love to provide almost round the clock childcare for free, while also paying to rent a room and for other expenses.

I was incredibly horned-up, it was kind of embarrassing esp since my husband didn't feel that way at the time at all.

Surprised you didn't laugh in their faces.", "Stick to your words. Tell them no and go LC if you have to. They are being so entitled. Live your life.

She just might allow it.", ">It's not just about the classes - it is about the work outside the classes\n\nExactly this. A 3 credit class over 14 weeks, you should be spending 9 hours a week on the subject. When I was in college, my classes were typically 2x/ week,  90 minutes each. So 6 hours outside of class for each course. If OP is doing 12 credits / semester (full time) they will be spending 24 hours per week outside of class on school-36 hours total each week. That's a full time job. How are they going to work around that?\n\nEdit: OP said part time work, part time school. It's hard enough to find a job around a school schedule, that makes it *even more* ridiculous to think that OP's brother and SIL can work around that lol.

Super unlucky for the couple, but no indication that they weren\u2019t following medical advice.", "There's nothing magical about hitting 6 weeks postpartum that makes it okay to have sex again. Some people feel ready and are healed well before 6 weeks, and some take longer than that. You don't need a doctor to tell you if you are healed enough, the idea that you can't figure out your own body and know if you're ready is just another way the medical system oversteps and tries to make itself an authority in our lives.", "YIKES. That poor woman. I feel comfortable jumping to the abuse hopscotch square on this. Not consenting is still assault despite her \"not refusing\"\n\nI'm glad the doctor stepped in but damn I hope that poor woman got help.", "That poor woman. It really shows that sex isn\u2019t always about love\u2014it can be about power and control. When I get irritated at my husband, I read Reddit, and want to kiss him. \n\nMy children are grown, but I believe I was told to wait eight weeks before resuming sexual activity. My husband and I waited much longer than that. It took me a long time to recover after giving birth. Also, if memory serves, I bled for several weeks. \n\nI bet your mother saw everything as a nurse.", "Lol!", "The whole year after I had my child my sex drive was higher than ever before. I think my body just wanted to be pregnant again lol.", "Same! Would highly recommend \u270c\ufe0f", "Just for my own info, do y\u2019all have children?\n\nDoctors don\u2019t always recommend six weeks after giving birth to have sex. They sometimes recommend anywhere from 2-6. Pain can be a factor, but the most common concerns are infections due to tears. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s necessarily a great idea to jump right back into the sack, but assuming a woman is being abused is just ridiculous. Some women have a higher sex drive after giving birth and even report more pleasure from sex. \n\nI think age should also be a factor. This couple is 31, and some women are cautious about having children over the age of 35. Again, not a reason to jump immediately back in the sack, but her body, her choice.", "How on earth is he supposed to pay rent without a paid job?

A slave who pays to be used.\n\nOP, you would be a fool if you agreed to your brother's proposal.

Hahahaha!  RUN, OP!!", "Slaves are provided with food and board so this is a notch down from that.", "Um well just because the woman didn't want it doesn't mean the man didn't, and wouldn't force themselves on their wives. Pretty sure \"wifely duties\" whatever bs. Marital rape. My mom is an Irish twin. My biological grandfather was an asshole.", "A woman postpartum is literally more susceptible to infection while still bleeding/having lochia. Putting anything up there, including a partner's penis, is increasing that risk.", "And this type of thinking is why women died at 30 from childbirth less than 100 years ago.", "Where did I assume anything?", "I was a live in nanny when I was 19 for my brother. I got free room and board and paid $800/month. I would never do it again. Working for family was the worst. NTA", "No, they actually want a live in nanny that also generates income for them from renting a room to her!", "sounds like they want a share of his unemployment money. this is so out there that i\u2019m compelled to not even believe it. if it is true, woooooow", "Have you thought about moving to a different area to do uni? Definitely definitely NTA but it may help your sanity if you\u2019re at least 1 hour or more away", "My Great Aunt had 2 sets of Irish twins (8 kids in total) From her side of things she was the pushy one\u2026 \n\nShe also lived to 102 and was always a firecracker.", "Thats a dark view....", "The main risk of infection is if there are unhealed wounds. Many women do not tear at all, especially those who have had babies before. A bit of lochia isn't a contraindication. Again, women know if they are bleeding too much to be comfortable with penetration. If someone feels the need to get \"approved for sex\" by a doctor, that's up to them. But it's also fine to figure it out ourselves.", "Not at all the same thing. One of the main  causes of death in the past was doctors not knowing that they had to wash their hands after doing autopsies, and then spreading infection to women delivering babies. Look it up. Women die today in childbirth still, and the rate is higher in the US than in other industrialized countries, partially because of overuse, or incorrect use, of medical interventions. Appropriate medical care can be lifesaving in childbirth for sure, but needing a doctor to approve you to have sex? No.", "\u2018It\u2019s not something the woman has any choice about\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll take downvotes and agree\u2019", "If they are so sad about it, they can come and provide childcare!

Dark makes one think what kind of window the person views the world from.\n\nI have no reason to think more Irish twins are the results of marital rape, then any child is the result of material rape.
