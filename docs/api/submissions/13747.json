Why would you want this job without pay?\n\nAlso, 2 pregnancies in one year? That was on them and their dumb choices. I can barely believe she wanted to be touched one month after given birth\u2026", "NTA! They made the kids, they can take care of them. You have your life to focus on. They are being horribly selfish.\n\nBesides, nannies get paid a lot more than whatever free rent they might offer.\n\nYour family can kick rocks.", "NTA not your kids not your responsibility.", "NTA. Why should you give up on your live, even working part time to be a free babysitter for your brothers children? Why would they even expect such things? If they really need help this much and have space, they could look for an Au pair who will watch the kids for a few hours a day. \n\nBut no. Defintly NTA . Especially as they don't even think about paying you (as far as I got from your story)", "NTA. You are in no way required to do this for them.  The responsibility for finding and paying for childcare is completely on them.   Stick to your guns. No is a complete sentence.", "This is the easiest NTA I've ever given. Your brother and sister-in-law need to suck it up and pay for help. Maybe not a live-in but at least a babysitter to help out with the older kid when the younger one is born. \n\nThey are responsible for their reproductive choices. I would let them know that you have your own life to live and you can't be responsible for children they chose to have. And then, I would let them know that if they continue to bug about it, they will be blocked.", "Definitely NTA but they are big ones for:\n\n1. Not planning their lives out.\n2. Making their poor choices other people's problems.\n3. Being bossy and manipulative.\n4. Being completely disrespectful to your personal choices and plans for your life.\n5. Using family to further their manipulative ways.\n6. Totally disregarding that you have your own life which you do not wish to rotate around school and THEIR KIDS. \n7. Being totally self centered, self absorbed and selfish. \n\nLive your life OP. Studying and working part time is a fantastic choice, and I wish you the very best.", "NTA.  Just a firm and respectful \"No\" is fine.  You've explained yourself enough.  Silence goes a long way if they push the issue - just don't reply until they handle their own responsibilities.", "NTA. \n\nThey aren\u2019t entitled to free childcare because they have kids very close in age.", "NTA, not your responsibility. Live your life! Don't move in with them. They probably gonna treat you badly/without gratitude and probably with more issues and fights to come when you move in", "Didn't you say that for your plan to go to uni to work, you needed to have a part time paying job?  Wouldn't you have to give up that plan to be their nanny?  \n\nDefinitely NTA.  You can't scrap your plans for your future for them.", "NTA. You said no and that is that. If having help caring for their children is so important to them, they can hire someone. Or your parents can step up and do it rather than being disappointed in you for saying no.", "NTA - Your brother and SIL *decided* to have unprotected sex days after the birth of their first born child. It's up to them to deal with the consequences.", "NTA - Your brother and SIL are giant assholes for even suggesting this IMO.  \u201cHelping out\u201d would a great thing for you to volunteer\u2026..normally this is an offer of regular support during a set period of time.  Eg. I can come by and make dinner a few times a month or help with some chores once a week for the first few months etc.\n\nAny kind of help from a parents perspective is gravy (free shit), only to be balanced out by visitors who don\u2019t do anything but exhaust our social capital.  Your bro and SIL put themselves in the Irish twins situation and will have to make due.  If I were you I\u2019d let them know that help is available on your terms (that you should lay out, if you feel so inclined), or that you don\u2019t really need to be involved at all.\n\nBut for the love of god don\u2019t beat yourself up over this.  They\u2019re the ones who suck here.", "NTA - They need to pay for childcare, they shouldn't try to guilt trip you into sacrificing your life for their choices.", "NTA. The entitled behaviour of them plus also your family is quite outstanding really, it\u2019s hardly like taking care of 2 small children is an easy task and they don\u2019t even want to pay you! They got themselves into this situation I mean seriously getting pregnant immediately after having a baby that\u2019s just stupid. They need to sort out their own problems what if you had a full time job and weren\u2019t going to uni then what would they do?", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are trying to take advantage of you. They do not care about your feelings, needs, or your life, they only care about themselves. Thus the entitlement and mistreatment they\u2019re exhibiting. Their demands and reactions are beyond inappropriate. \n\nYou need to stop engaging with their behavior, and stand up for yourself, be firm. You, as well as anyone with a modicum of sense, clearly knows you are not the AH for refusing to essentially being their unpaid live-in nanny who pays rent (the absurdity of that arrangement defies reason).\n\nDo not throw away your life and future by giving in to them. Do not worry about people who don\u2019t care about you.", "NTA - sorry but family is not entitled to free labor just because they need it. It doesn't work that way.", "NTA - you're free to live your life as you. What they're angry about is not having free childcare available to them.", "NTA, absolutely not your problem that they are having children that close together without a childcare plan.  Everyone who is trying to guilt you can feel free to move in and be their full time servant/unpaid labor.  How ridiculous.", "Easiest NTA, as someone who worked as a live in nanny it's a hard job! To demand you care for their children for free simply because you're family is an insult. Its not like they asked you to watch them occasionally for a date night. You're in your 30s and clearly stated you want to focus on school.", "What on earth??? \n\nNTA AT ALL. They decided to have two children 10 months apart knowing what their support system was and now it falls on them to take care of their children. The sheer entitlement to your time and labor is astounding, and for FREE! And having the gall to be angry at you for refusing this ludicrous demand! Ridiculous. Do not let them guilt you into becoming their free nanny out of \u201cobligation\u201d to their children. Those are THEIR children. That THEY chose to have. Not your circus, not your monkeys. \u201cHelping out\u201d as your parents put it is watching the kids every now and then, picking them up from daycare or a friends house every now and again when the parents are in a bind. It is NOT putting your life and plans on hold and uprooting your entire life system to move into someone else\u2019s house to care for their kids FOR FREE.\n\nYou are someone who has not been in school since they were 16 going to college, it will be hard. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to manage it given you\u2019re an adult who has worked for many years but studying is hard, especially if you haven\u2019t done it in a while. The time it takes up isn\u2019t just the time that you\u2019re actively in classes, the bulk of the work and learning is done outside of them. They are not thinking of you at all and honestly that lack of consideration for others and selfishness at their age is very concerning. Especially for people who are now parents. And paired with the seeming lack of accountability for their choices it really makes me worry for those kids.\n\nYour parents are enabling your brother and SIL\u2019s entitlement. Theirs is not a reasonable request(demand) and if they are so disappointed and concerned that your brother and SIL won\u2019t have a free live in nanny they are free to assume that role themselves. Your brother and SIL need to buck up and come to terms with the fact that they are responsible for their children. And they\u2019d better be quick about it too, the show already started.", "NTA, easily not. They are beyond TAH. The entitlement they're exhibiting is astounding, and that's not counting how insulting it is to expect you to do it for free.", "NTA. \n\nWhat kind of generational BS is THIS?? \nYOU are not responsible for your brother and sister-in-law\u2019s kids, nor to be their nanny, paid or unpaid. \n\nLET THEM BE ANGRY! LET THEM RAGE! FFS! \n\nAnd don\u2019t let them emotionally manipulate you into doing something you do not want to do.", "Of course they are pushing - it\u2019s an amazing deal for them if they can get you to nanny for free as a family member who can be guilted and won\u2019t be as easily able to establish work boundaries. But it\u2019s selfish of them. You do what\u2019s good for you. NTA", "NTA. It sounds like it would be a one-sided relationship with you doing all of the work.", "NTA. They had 9 months to figure out childcare. Their poor planning isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA  \n\nBrother and SIL are angry because they were counting on free babysitter for their kids.    \n\n*How dare you not want to work for free for us! Who cares if you have a plan for your own life?*", "That sounds horrific. Your brother's and SIL's poor planning or precautions does not create an emergency, or obligation, for you. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd you can tell the Grandparents they failed miserably explaining the birds and bees.\n\nIn addition, I'm pretty sure people have raised children w/o family support before.

Why are you asking if you're the asshole for not letting them take complete advantage of you.\n\nShe'll occasionally let you eat some food? So, they'll let you eat the leftovers they don't want.

You get literally NOTHING.\n\nBeing a live-in nanny for ONLY room and board would be an outrageously offensive offer. But this is something else.\n\nAbsolutely put your foot down.
