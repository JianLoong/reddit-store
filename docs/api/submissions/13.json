{"id": 13, "submission_id": "10c4vsj", "title": "AITA for joking that my guy friend is doing a girl workout?", "selftext": "So I've (F23) been pretty active in the gym for a year and a half now. One of my guy friends Xander (M20) decided to start bulking a year ago. I've known Xander for three years now through a mutual friend, and he had honestly been a stick a majority of the time I knew him. Having been insecure and eventually grown tired of the \"scrawny shit,\" Xander decided to start working out. My boyfriend Ross (M24) and I went to the same college with Xander before we graduated last year, and last January, we both started taking Xander to the gym.\n\nI have to say, Xander ended up making great progress for a year, and he got visibly lean. Ross and my friends and I all hyped him up for this, and recently for winter break, we were all hanging out with friends at Xander's place. I asked Xander about his leg routine, and he mentioned that he had started doing barbell hip thrusts five months ago. I was a little surprised, but having the joking dynamic with Xander that I have, I said, \"Hip thrusts? That's definitely gonna do wonders for your cake like the squats, but that's sort of a girl thing bro.\" Xander chuckled and said, \"Yeah well, here I am defying the norm.\"\n\nWell last night, I ended up getting a text from Ross that he heard from our mutual friend that Xander was pretty hurt by my comment. From what Ross told me, Xander was not only hurt that I was stereotyping an exercise that he was committing to, but it apparently especially stung hearing it from his \"teacher.\" Apparently, Xander also said that it's people like me why guys are scared to do hip thrusts at the gym. It was sincerely not my intention to hurt Xander, I really was just trying to be goofy. I'm here debating over whether to apologize to Xander or not, but I also wonder if I should drop it or if it was even that bad in the first place. Ross thinks I should say something. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I can admit the joke wasn't exactly the shining example of how to encourage a gym friend, but everyone's acting like I was avidly trying to be malicious or put Xander down. And I'm not shaming Xander for this, but I also question why he felt the need to go to our other friends instead of me.
