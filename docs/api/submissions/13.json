He and his now wife sent me an invitation and mentioned a \"no +1\" rule. Meaning that I wasn't allowed to bring my wheelchair bound boyfriend of 4 years with me. I tried to dicuss an exception for this rule because for one, my boyfriend is family and no one would deny that fact. And two, I could not find proper arrangements to have someone watch him (I'm his primary caregiver) while I was gone.\n\n\nI brought him with me to the wedding. My brother and his bride were livid and picked up an argument with me about it. My brother said some hurtful stuff but I was glad he didn't say it infront of my boyfriend. I told him it's not like my boyfriend was making a fuss or being distracting (he just remained quiet and respectful of everyone around him) my brother argued that non of that matter and that the trust and respect he had for me was gone the minute I decided to stomp on his wedding boundaries and override the rules. My parents understood my side but also said that it was my brother's wedding and I should've respected the rule he had for non-official couples.\n\n\nWe've not been talking since the wedding. I tried calling him but keep getting hung up on. His wife texted me yesterdag to stop calling.\n\n\nAITA? Its not like I brought a hyper active child to the wedding, I think he might have overreacted but I'm not sure.", "created_utc": 1667218890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiadxe/aita_for_bringing_my_wheelchair_bound_boyfriend/", "score": 9050, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's an AH move.\n\nThe correct move would have been to not attend. I know it's your brother's wedding and it would have been heart wrenching to miss. It feels icky comparing your role as primary carer to the role of a parent, but I'm going to do it anyway since apparently your boyfriend needs a constant carer (you said you couldn't find anyone to \"watch\" him). Parents who can't find a *carer* shouldn't bring their kids to a child free wedding because *they aren't invited*. You couldn't find anyone to \"watch him\" so you shouldn't have brought him because *he wasn't invited*.\n\nYou then could have had the moral high ground when people asked why you weren't there.

Your brother and his now wife had to plan things knowing how many people are attending (seating, food, gift bags, etc...) and you threw a wrench in that. Yes, you are the sister of the groom, but that doesn't give you the right to go against their wishes/plans.

I\u2019m sure you guys have a plan in place for those excursions; that\u2019s what inter-abled couples do. You talk about it, have a plan, and thereby give each other space and autonomy. But in this case, you imply that your brother and sister-in-law\u2019s wedding was different and they should pity your \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d boyfriend and make an exception.

Yeah YTA but single-handedly ruined is a stretch", "You're so right, and how embarrassed would the boyfriend have been knowing he was there uninvited?

OP is suggesting that they couldn't find someone else to help care for their partner, when they had (presumably) months to plan and find someone?\n\nThat means that if OP ever gets sick of has some sort of emergency, the partner is completely screwed.

It is sucky for people in long term relationships. If I were OP I would have stayed home with my BF and I feel that would have been a NAH or maybe ESH.

It\u2019s trashy as hell for the brother to not invite OPs long term boyfriend. There are lots of ways to limit guest count and not inviting your sisters partner isn\u2019t one of them. (Carve out an exception for someone she hasn\u2019t been dating long, but that doesn\u2019t apply here.)

Solution: invite kids of cousins and bridal party members but didn\u2019t extend it to all the guests. We had 10 kids there instead of 50 and everyone understood.\n\nOf course, it was also trashy as hell for OP to bring an uninvited guest along with her so that\u2019s why it\u2019s ESH.

My aunt is quadriplegic and relies primarily on voice technology to do basic things like look up phone numbers because she cannot type very well. The voice technology is not always convenient though (especially because she has an accent), and looking up simple things takes her a lot longer than normal.

Often family/partners end up filling a primary carer role by default (though not always), and they can receive carers' pensions but are, for the most part, unpaid.

Other quads have various movement in their arms, limited hand function; some need splints but can type or draw with aids, some can actually hold things in their hands because they have some thumb \"squeeze\". So it all depends. My issue with OP is that she says she has to \"watch\" her BF as opposed to staying to \"help\" him. She's not a babysitter; that term is really inappropriate. If she's implying that BF was excluded BECAUSE of his disability, she should have made a stand by staying away from the wedding.

Just say \"wheelchair users.\" It's not an issue of being chained to one or whatever. It is assistive!!! It HELPS them! It's like able-bodied ppl saying \"omg don't say disabled, say differently abled\" NO, because disabilities literally mean you cannot do some things without assistance, and able-bodied people need to recognize that it's not their place to decide what a disabled person can or can't do with or without help.

A caregiver\u2019s role is to provide aid to a patient but allow them as much autonomy as possible.

It's rubbish they didn't invite him, did you talk to your brother? Did you talk it through with you BF? I get being a carer is hard but it's hard enough being disabled without being made the center of attention, it's cruel, he is his own person with his own feelings.
