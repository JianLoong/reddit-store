We had their tent set up right next to the playground, and after sunset he & his buddy drove the atv to the tent. I wanted to run down t9 the tent & surprise him with a joint, so I went to the playground & grabbed a joint from where I had rolled & stashed it earlier. It was a new moon & I didnt anticipate the lack of lighting at the playground/camping area. It was pitch black except for the tent which was lit brightly from the ATV light. I walked toward the bright-as-day tent area and tripped over an unknown object. Turns out it was a backboard for the horseshoe game. \n\nI fell onto the rebar stake of the horseshoe game and suffered the following injuries: 1 rib broken but not displaced, another rib comminuted aka broken into a bunch of pieces, a punctured lung, torn diaphragm, & both lung collapsed from the pressure in my chest cavity. I had to crawl a considerable distance with 2 collapsed lungs, & my heart & trachea were displaced to the point where my trache was almost sideways & my heart was on the opposite side of my chest. Ive had multiple surgeries & am in pain every waking moment unless i take a pain killer, which i rarely do because the digestive issues the meds cause last a lot longer than the relief i get from the meds. I filed a claim on his insurance & am considering additional litigation due to the safety threats the exposed rebar very obviously posed for years & years prior to my accident. I was on life support & will need at least 1 more surgery, in addition to the scars from bilateral chest tubes & placement  /removal of a titanium plate. \n\nEveryone (on my SO's side) is saying I should cancel litigation and \"own\" my part becayse im the one who fell. I think I should be able to stumble in a literal playground & not almost get impaled, & if it werent my bf's property the accident happened on they'd never tell me to drop it. I may be biased bc im in so much pain daily so AITA?\n\nEDIT: I didn't literally run.

You are the one who was walking around in the dark. To find a joint you left in a playground, no less. Would you be mentioning that in the case?

Walking around in the dark without a flashlight is. It sucks that you were hurt so severely, but to the extent anyone is to blame, it is 100% you.", "YTA  It baffles me that people have gotten so litigious that the 1st response is always SUE. You were running around in the dark ffs.  It's your fault!  It's terrible you were injured so severely, but it's still your fault.  Why in the world would you be camping without a flashlight.", "Let me see if I understand...\n\nYou were walking in the dark to go get a joint. You then tripped over essentially a horseshoe pit, falling onto a piece of metal which is a perfectly normal set up for a horseshoe pit. \n\nYou filed against his insurance to cover medical treatment. \n\nWhat exactly are you trying to achieve with suing? If you already got a settlement from insurance, I'm not sure suing will get you more money here. You say, \"I am considering additional litigation due to the safety threats the exposed rebar very obviously posed for years & years prior to my accident\". Was this not covered in your initial claim? Also, if this was a normal horseshoe pit I really don't know that you will win. I can't think of a single campground that didn't have at least one of these...it isn't illegal to have a horseshoe pit.

Rip out the horse shoe bars every time? Bubble wrap everything so nobody gets hurt? Everything on a ranch can hurt you. You were out there in the dark driving a quad, which could have seriously injured you and you took that chance. You were going for a blunt which would make things even worse out there in the dark, but you were going to take that chance. It was a freak accident that happened in the dark. Not his fault at all. Because he owns the property, it makes it his fault? it's like me driving my car into a wall and saying hey who put that wall there, it's on your property so I'm gonna sue you. I'm assuming you're in the states, as most other places don't go court crazy and sue over everything every time they get hurt. You looking for someone to blame? Grab a mirror. He should not only win in court and have you pay all the lawyer fees, but also ditch you once it's over.", "INFO: And what does your SO say about this idea?

How about you take responsibility for your actions where you went walking around in the pitch black with no flashlight, that is you being negligent.", "YTA - Walking around a familiar place in the dark  is risky. Waking in an unfamiliar place in the dark, especially around a playground, is just asking to get hurt. I really think a flashlight would have avoided you getting injured in the first place.

You made the conscious choice to walk around in the dark now want a payday out of it and you\u2019re saying SO um assuming you mean ex-SO cause they will be soon.", "YTA. You knew that there were stationary objects setup around the campsite. You also knew that it was night time and there was no lighting in the area. Yet you chose to walk around without without a flashlight. Do you have a phone? Most phones come equipped with a flashlight, so there\u2019s no excuse for your choice if you do. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you told him you where you were going. If he had known I suspect he would have aimed the headlights of the atv so it would light up your path. You made a bad decision and it unfortunately has horrible consequences. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in so much pain and I hope you get the medical help you need. But it isn\u2019t your so\u2019s fault you didn\u2019t use a flashlight.", "YTA!\n\nSuing your SO (or ex as I imagine he is by now) for your own negligent behaviour whilst under the influence is really shitty. \n\n1) He will at the very least be forced to pay increased premiums on insurance for life or find it harder to get insured.\n\n2) He may be forced by the insurance company to pay them if it is not covered by his policy.\n\n3) At worst case the insurance company could decide to raise a private prosecution if he can't pay the fees which means he could potentially face prison.\n\n4) You are literally the only one to blame for your injuries by not paying attention to where you were going, carrying any form of flashlight (which face it if you had your phone - you had a flash light) additionally, you could have stopped when you realised you couldn't see where you were going and called out for someone to guide you through. Your own negligence is the sole reason you were injured.\n\nI am sorry you're in pain, I am sorry you got hurt. However, this is not a case where he shoved you and you fell on a piece of rebar, this is not a case where he hit you and hurt you. This is not a situation where there was even wet flooring that wasn't marked clearly. It was your choice to go without a light and got hurt as a direct result of being under the influence when doing so. Own your stupidity, and for the sake of your former partner I would suggest dropping litigation and never speak to him again.", "YTA. I\u2019m calling bullshit on this whole thing. This story absolutely makes no sense. You say you\u2019re in a state where weed is legal, so why did you need to hide the joint? And why would you hide it at the playground? You usually want to store weed in a dry location, a playground outside is not always a dry location. Also it seems strange that you tripped on the object as you were heading towards the brightly lit tent. If the tent was \u201cright next to the playground\u201d then some of the light should\u2019ve been able to illuminate the area. Also you were walking in a playground in \u201cpitch black\u201d, why weren\u2019t you looking where you were walking. Playgrounds have objects in them, you\u2019re gonna trip on one if you don\u2019t look where you\u2019re going. And most importantly, if you went to a playground, in the dark to look for an object you had hidden there, why didn\u2019t you bring a flashlight? If you could see enough to find your stashed joint, you should\u2019ve been able to see the horseshoe pit.", "I\u2019m probably going to get heat but idc. I have 35 years in construction and let me tell you there are some strict rules when it comes to exposed rebar. OP is damn lucky she didn\u2019t die. I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t warn her of the horseshoe pits or clearly mark them. NTA and get a headlamp OP.", "NTA. Sue him. Let the court sort it out. Also, don't take the 1st offer from the insurance company. Walking w/ a joint and falling is different than smoking and falling...", "YTA. If this is true at all. They have invented this thing that creates light, very tiny, is probably in your phone, they are called a flashlight. You don\u2019t walk around in the dark then blame someone else for falling over something", "This seems like a NAH situation, but maybe it's because I grew up in a rural area and as soon as you described walking around when it was pitch black I knew it was an awful idea", "ESH. If the rebar was in a place it shouldn't have been, then it should have been fixed. You also shouldn't have been running in the dark. \n\nBut, do you mean EX-SO? Because I can't see how this relationship works if you're threatening him with a lawsuit.", "NTA. It\u2019s up to a court to decide who is at fault. They may rule you 50% (or 20% or 90% or whatever) at fault and so you may only get some damages. With the severity of the damages, I think it\u2019s okay to let a court decide this rather than decide it between the two of you. That being said, when you sue someone you lose them as a friend. You will be giving up your relationship and many friends if you proceed.", "YTA.  Unless he rents the space to the general public and there are safety guidelines he is not following, YTA.  YOU STASHED A JOINT IN A PLAYGROUND.  You went there without a flashlight.  I get the claim to help offset your costs, but you were at fault for your own injuries.  Heads up, when they took you to the hospital, they drug tested you do they will know if you were drink or stoned.", "Info - Are you looking to sue him, the insurance company, or both?  Do you see a future with this person?\n\nI am inclined to say NAH, but all of those things may play a pretty big impact on both of your futures.  It was an accident, and insurance is made to cover accidents, but depending on how far everything goes, it could get ugly for him.", "NTA.  This is what property insurance is for.  If I was your SO I would want you to sue, it\u2019s not like he is going to be paying out of his own money.  This is a fairly devastating injury and I think you deserve to be compensated appropriately.  If he doesn\u2019t think so, I feel the relationship would be over.", "NTA, compensation is the least that you could be given if your HEART is on the wrong side of your body. It\u2019s one thing if it was a minor injury but you might have died, if you weren\u2019t compensated then suing someone is the only (good) response.", "NAH because it was an accident and a horseshoe pit is a pretty normal thing to have on a ranch. If I invite my friend over to my place and they trip and fall due to their own negligence, should I get sued? But maybe you can work something out where you can file a claim on his insurance. Hope you get better soon", "To everyone saying it was her fault.....what would you say if a kid had fallen into it.\n\nI really don't know who's to blame but I really hope there were no kids at this party\n\nSorry you are going through this OP", "NTA, \n\nI wouldn't say you're the asshole here, it sounds like a rough injury, not sure if you have any chance of winning tho.", "YTA.\n\nYou were the one who was walking around the ranch in pitch black.

It is called taking accountability for your actions and that mistakes happen.  I wouldn't expect this relationship to work out.", "YTA - why would you ever sue someone you love/ have a good relationship with?

You decided to walk in the dark... girl, you're definitely an ass hole.", "NTA: Your SO being the owner of the ranch if I interpreted right. Landowners have the liability in keeping their property free from harm. One way to go around it I believe would be to make sure safety signs were placed before hand but it looks like that wasn\u2019t the case. You had mention that he also knew about an expose rebar before hand but still didnt take the proper steps in safety proofing it or flat out fix the thing. If you are going to go the legal route you need to understand that this may break or strain the relationship you are in because once its starts you have decided whats more worth it teaching your SO a expense lesson or the relationship.", "NTA, specially when these things were a hazard from the beginning, keep in mind they can argue because of the joint and they might blame your clumsiness on \u201cdrug use\u201d either way to avoid any other accidents go ahead . Keep in mind your relationship might be in jeopardy once you follow through the suit", "NAH\n\nYou were seriously injured, and if he is liable and insured then the law will sort it out.  And if you are partly responsible (hint: you are) then the law will sort that out too. \n\nAnd if people are pissed about it, that's just understandable.  You aren't supposed to sue your SO, but then again you also aren't supposed to have traps on your property.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like the rebar pierced your foot and you recovered fully with only a scar. It pierced your chest cavity, resulting in both lungs collapsing, and honestly I'm amazed you're alive.\n\nOf course the pain weighs into your decision.

If not the rest of your life.\n\nNTA x1000 If he doesn't cover all of your expenses willingly, sue the fuck out of him.", "NTA - The owner of a property is responsible for the property. He knew there were dangerous elements that he should have fixed. If you leave your sidewalk in disrepair in front of your house and a stranger walking their dog and trips on it and gets injured the you would be responsible as well. Accidents happen, this one the damage caused was 100% preventable and caused by the neglect of the SO. Medical bills are expensive.

We had their tent set up right next to the playground, and after sunset he & his buddy drove the atv to the tent. I wanted to run down t9 the tent & surprise him with a joint, so I went to the playground & grabbed a joint from where I had rolled & stashed it earlier.

Ive had multiple surgeries & am in pain every waking moment unless i take a pain killer, which i rarely do because the digestive issues the meds cause last a lot longer than the relief i get from the meds. I filed a claim on his insurance & am considering additional litigation due to the safety threats the exposed rebar very obviously posed for years & years prior to my accident. I was on life support & will need at least 1 more surgery, in addition to the scars from bilateral chest tubes & placement  /removal of a titanium plate. \n\nEveryone (on my SO's side) is saying I should cancel litigation and \"own\" my part becayse im the one who fell.

Im honestly not sure super how it all works, I just know every moment im awake & sometimes even when im sleeping (moving into a position wherein im lying in my rib wrong wakes me up) im in pain", "[deleted]", "Thanks for your perspective", "Yeah, some people in the comments are saying he won't have to pay anything but that isn't necessarily true. I feel like her best bet is to prove negligence, and even if his insurance covers the payout, they are for sure going to hike his rates up. They may even make him pay. It wouldn't be the insurances fault if she proved someone besides herself is at fault. \n\nI think when you are on a literal campground you assume some risk. Especially when you choose to go out in the dark and walk around where you know there is a horseshoe pit. \n\nUnless he is required to cover the pit or have it lit up I doubt any judge is going to find him at fault.\n\nEdit to add: obviously it depends on location, but I can't find anything stating you have to cover a horseshoe pit. The only thing I can find is people recommending you put a tarp or cloth over it so it doesn't get weathered. But a tarp or cloth isn't going to stop those injuries. OP says they weren't impaled.", "Exactly. If OP had hit their head on a rock they also could have died but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make the property owner negligent.", "I havent been paid any settlemnt as of now", "She wasn't an employee of the ranch or working at the time. OSHA has absolutely no jurisdiction on this situation.\n\nAt best the OSHA reg could be used to imply that it should have been known as hazardous. Which is stretching it since that is how every horseshoe pit in the country is set up.", "Actually it is not in most states and because the owner\u2019s residence is a part of the property any recreational spaces would not fall under OSHA at all. The playground is included with this as well as being a part of the residence and not a working space for the ranch.\n\nThe best bet you have is to go after his insurance but also keep in mind t try hat his rates are going to skyrocket for the next three years. Look I get it, really I do, you were hurt and think you deserve to be paid because of it but that\u2019s a dick move to pull on anyone and it is extra AH behavior to do this to your boyfriend.    YTA", "im not super well versed in OSHA laws, but is a big playground on a commercial ranch & all exposed rebar on a working ranch is required to have some type of end cap. The housing for the ranch workers is covered under smaller policies for the residential area, but the playground is outside of the \"ranch manager\" house & is zoned as part of the commercial ranch & covered by the commercial policy. I incorrectly estimated where I was on the playground & had there been even a smidge of light I wouldve been far away from the horseshoe game. Ive never even played horeshoes but I was aware that there was a horseshoe game on the playground.", "The pit cant be removed for the time being now because the insurance claim, but we put large spools for wire on the stakes so no one else can get hurt", "how did I make up drama? By falling onto a stake accidentally?", "It was akin to having the wind knocked out of me. My whole body felt like when your foot is asleep. It was terrifying & I have nightmares about it bc I had the sensation in the ambulance like I was being pulled out of my body. Hard to explain", "Tell that little dumbass to not be wandering around in the DARK in a fucking ranch, maybe???", "I see. There is a pretty good chance that the insurance companies settlement offer will be on the condition that you sign an agreement saying you will not sue the homeowner.  Talk to your lawyer because this might be something you don\u2019t need to stress over", "Just a heads up these types of cases go on for years. Also do not be surprised if the lawyer for the insurance company hires a pi to follow you around. MY MIL is an insurance attorney and they basically send PI to check up on everybody. Id say half her cases end because the pi catches the person dancing at a wedding when they claim there back and neck is broken and can never work again. Just keep that in mind. \n\nIm also not sure how you can still be with someone your suing. You need to be careful he is not trying to get info from emails, text, or voicemails. Something your lawyer sends you might be the piece the other side needs to beat you. \n\nIm kind of an asshole so take this with a grain of salt. If my wife was suing me I would be hoovering up as much info I can. I personally would feel attacked if she sued me. It would be war.", "oh that's big, didn't know you hadn't received any payout at all.", "I.. don't understand why you would want to sue him then? If yall are together then you're surely sharing things? Especially if you have a child together.  If you sue him. It's likely the end of your relationship.  Plus it takes money from both of you for lawyers and court costs - only to.. what? Go from him to you? When it could just be both of yours now. I honestly don't understand the logic in this at all.", "Lol well good luck with that.", "I\u2019d rather fall on a rod right now too", "How exactly do you see this going? Are yall still together. I'd see suing my bf as suing myself. We're life partners. How does this help anything?", "Have you even consulted a lawyer? Because it very much seems not only do you have no case, but suing would end your relationship.\n\nI am sympathetic to your injuries and what you've been through but it seems like you're reversing horse and cart.", ">They may even make him pay. \n\nCompletely untrue.  Situations like this are exactly why liability insurance exists.  An insurance company can't refuse to pay out if it's determined their insured was liable for someone's injuries.  That's bad faith, and every state in the land has laws about it.", "SO will definitely pay in some fashion.  Could even lose the property if op were successful in the lawsuit.  I find it amazing, op says they are still together. If I were in SOs shoes, I wouldn't be very understanding.", "I realize that.  The fact remains, though, if his insurance pays out their limits, you aren't going to be able to turn around and sue your SO for more money.  Obviously, laws vary from state to state, but I've never seen a limits claim paid that still allowed for further litigation against an insured.", "You are not a worker on the ranch, commercial or not. I doubt OSHA can help you at all", "Why didn\u2019t you take your phone & use it as a flashlight?", "Were you a paying guest, employee, or a personal guest? Did you have permission to be on the playground at night. If the playground is considered \"closed\" at night then no lights would be needed or required. You stated you wanted to surprise your SO. Is that why you didn't use a flashlight? Do you not think stashing drugs on a playground is dangerous? What if a child had found it? \n\nThe O in OSHA stands for occupational, which means it is for the safety of someone that works there. So not sure the OSHA standards would apply to a SO. Much like a child of the owner of a business can work at the business even if they are below the minimum age to have a job.  So I wouldn't put a lot of eggs in that basket.", "You were walking around in the dark without a light,  come on..... this is your own disregard for your own safety and well being. Sorry that you are suffering but now it seems you just are looking to get a payout out for your own poor decision making. \n\nSay bye to the relationship if you do sue.", "\u201cIf only there was a smidge of light.\u201d She says as if she doesn\u2019t carry around a flashlight with her nearly every second of the day. OP this was a completely avoidable accident had you just used the tiniest bit of common sense so obviously YTA if you sue your SO for something that was completely avoidable and 100% your fault.", "Okay, that\u2019s good, but my question still stands. What is your goal in suing your significant other? and is the possibility of achieving that goal worth losing this relationship?", "You are only using the guy as a provider and don\u2019t actually give a shit about your relationship, so obviously this whole thing is being done as revenge.\nWhat a great example you two must be to your kid \ud83d\ude44", "This whole story is made up", "Have you talked to anyone about that experience? Like professionally? You're reacting poorly to stimuli in a way that makes me wonder if you have some PTSD or similar trauma related issues going on. You are potentially an AH but with extenuating circumstances. Sadly trauma is the best chance you have at being N.T.A.- adjacent.", "Because OP is a leech", "THIS\n\nI literally said in a comment, op may as well sue themselves. I just don't understand how they think they're gonna benefit from this.", "OP is also probably going to cheat...\n\n>I havent done it,  but if approached with the invitation of an affair I'd very likely entertain the thought after being cheated on. Very likely to cheat now.\n\n/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/10f83sd/revenge_cheating/j4vpt7y/j4vpt7y", "I think it has to do with insurance - his insurance company will not pay for her injuries unless a suit is filed.\n\nThat's why you see horrific headlines about the family of a car accident victim in which members of both parties died suing the surviving minor child of the other party. The minor child will not actually pay, but it's the only way to get money from the insurance company.\n\nETA: i am not a lawyer and do not work in insurance. just another Reddit Armchair Expert, so take it with a grain of salt!", "I have an attorney who said I have a case for the full policy due to the catastrophic nature of my injury. If I could get the pain to stop & feel confident in not needing further surgeries (at minimum  I'll need 1 more) I'd feel more comfortable with not pursuing the claim/suit", "Eh, debate doesn't matter. Based on way way way too many conflicting posts I truly believe OP is making this all up.\n\nEdit to add: they will 100% hike his rates. He will pay, just not directly.", "Looking at OPs other posts I'm pretty convinced this is all fake at this point. Every other post is finding a man, that man cheating, having a baby like 2 months ago, and then him cheating? It's all over the place. She's suing another man because of their kids...it's just too much for me. It already sounded fake when they said their trachea was sideways but based on so so many other out there posts I just can't buy into this one.", "Seriously. I am just trying to wrap my mind around it? And like. Maybe they're just so out of it between pain and medication and they're struggling with logic? I don't know. But.. they're gonna cut off their nose to spite their face if they do this.", "She says she is considering additional litigation which suggests to me she is going after him beyond the insurance claim.", "I work in insurance. What the attorney wants his insurance to do is something called \u201cpresenting their limits,\u201d ie, they\u2019re filing for the entirety of the Bodily Injury coverage on the SO\u2019s policy. Considering the level of OP\u2019s injuries, they likely have a good case. The issue will be how much coverage the SO has. Depending on the state and whether he has above the state minimum coverage, that can vary quite a bit. \n\nYou\u2019re jumping the gun a little here, though, OP. His carrier has to make their offer first. If they present limits and you still have outstanding medical bills, it would be at that point you could file suit against him directly, but that\u2019s only going to work if he is financially sound enough to sue. \n\nI\u2019m hesitant to provide judgment, but if you do go forward with a suit I don\u2019t think your relationship will survive it.", "What have you been offered from his/(your?) insurance.  Sounds like the attorney is saying you might get the max the policy allows if you sue \u2026 how much is currently on the table?", "Cannot take painkillers you say, in the same post you talk about smoking joints, when pot has well known analgesic effects. \nSomething smells worse than what you are smoking.", "They may very well raise his rates, but they aren't going to string him out to dry on this claim.", "Ah, one of those.", "I don't know... there's just a lot that doesn't add up.  After seeing this comment, I took a look at her history too.  She supposedly had this injury a year ago, and then all the posts about being cheated on \"4 days after giving birth, on mother's day\" which she repeats over and over.... lawsuits over custody.\n\nIf nothing else, I can say with certainty: OP needs some professional help.", "The trachea part threw me off too. And the heart on the other side of the chest. What???? \ud83d\ude44", "I mean.  I was involved in a collision with an 18 wheeler and didnt come out with the injuries OP got from tripping...", "Eh, let's not pretend that weed will kill the same level of pain as an opioid or strong NSAID or something like that", "Lmao what?", "Yep. I clicked on 4 posts and just those 4 make for a timeline that makes absolutely no sense. 25 days ago complaing she needs to leave her cheating boyfriend but no mention that his property almost killed her? \n\nA year ago talking about how he's a multimillionaire and lists a few properties but zero mention of a ranch? But in the same post saying they almost died but zero context how?", "Well and maybe I can't do math, but it feels like OP would have been pregnant at this time? And considering how detailed they were on the injuries I don't believe they'd leave that info out..."]}
