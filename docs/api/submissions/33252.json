My sisters (f 30) family and my parents have keys s to my appartment in case something would happen. \n\nWe usually send eachother good night texts. I rly don't care if I get one it not but my mom kinda wants it? I reply for her sake. Otherwise she gives me remarks. \n\nA month agao I forgot to text her good night. In the middle of the night. I wake up when the lights in my hallway lights up. I bolt up, asks who the fuck are in my appartment with tears in my eyes.\n\nIt's my mom. She said she got concerned because I forgot to text her goodnight. She tried to call but no one answered. I had my phone on mute. Accidentally. \n\nI said to her that that's not an excuse for barging in in my appartment like this. She didn't even ring the bell or anything. \n\nThen she gets mad at me. She was just concerned, what if something had happened to me? Like slipped and hit my head in the shower? I hadn't come home from work? \n\nI said it doesn't matter. That's her worry she kinda have to controll. This is unacceptable behaviour. \n\nShe gets livid at me, I'm ungrateful for having parents that care about me. And if I just replied to texts this wouldn't be an issue. \n\nShe storms off. I cry myself to sleep, feeling kinda ungrateful. After that my sister tells me that my mum is right. It wasn't to bad and she would want some one checking up on her if the roles where reversed. \nI don't know how to handle this. I said I'm sorry and my mom accepted it and now act's like nothing happened. \n\nAfter this night, I have had nightmares of people comming into my appartment unannounced. I have had night terrors of waking up and people have been standing by my bed, looking at me. I even thought I saw a dude with a gun one time. I thought, this time I fucking die.  \n\nMy question is, despite my nightmares. Am I the asshole for getting angry at my mom because of this?

That\u2019s not at all appropriate treatment of an adult child, unless you have an explicit agreement that you\u2019re using the other person as a safety (like having someone you call/text after getting home safely from a date with someone you met online, or I\u2019ve known disabled folks who use a safety for bathing when they\u2019re feeling wobbly and worry about getting injured and not being able to summon help).  And even if you\u2019re using someone as a safety, they should knock or ring first, and only come in if there is an indication that you need help or you don\u2019t respond in an appropriate amount of time.\n\nBarging right in like that is an unacceptable use of a key, and tbh I\u2019d probably demand the key be returned after that.  You deserve to feel safe in your home, and by invading the way she did, she has taken that from you.  Hopefully it will be temporary, and your subconscious will settle down, but it can definitely take a while.", "NTA. That was an unreasonable reaction from your mum. Reminds me of \u201cBart do you like my new chainsaw and hockey mask\u201d if you get the reference", "NTA and what she did is indefensible.\n\nShe *wanted* you to be traumatized for not texting her. If not, she would have acted as an adult and rang the doorbell.\n\nYou need to prevent future home invasions. Take the keys back and let her know in emphatic terms that you will never be giving her a nightly text again.\n\nEdit: that was supposed to be \"keys\" not \"key\". Keyholder who agrees with mom shouldn't keep their key, either.", "NTA at all.\n\nSure it's ok for parents to care about their adult kids but your Mom is taking this WAY too far.\n\nInvading/coming into your space, especially in the middle of the night, is totally unacceptable.\n\nYour mom needs to stop projecting her fears/anxieties onto you.\n\nI hope you start feeling safe in your apartment again when the shock of what happened recedes.\n\n If the nightmares continue please seek support from a healthcare professional or therapist.", "NTA, because you didn\u2019t know who it was at first\u2026.for all you know it could\u2019ve been a criminal. You didn\u2019t know it was just your mom, sounds like a horror movie. \n\nQuestion though, how did she treat you growing up? Since she\u2019s using her caring about you to rationalize it.", "This had nothing to do with checking up on you. This was intentional. If she was genuinely concerned ~~she would've called first, and~~ instead of barging in she would've knocked on your door. She wanted to scare you, she wanted you to assert that you are not allowed to not text her. She was punishing you because you dared to not put her first in your mind.\n\nYou are NTA at all. Your mother is abusive and toxic, and your sister is not a good source to go to on this because just like you, she's been raised to accept these things as normal.\n\nIf your mom has a key, change your locks for now. I also think you'd be much better off moving far away from her and going low or no contact.", "NTA \n\nyou're an ADULT and you've been one for years. It's time for her to cut the cord and let you live your own life. Barging into your apartment in the middle of the night is ridiculous", "NTA.  It's time to change the locks. They don't need keys to your place. These nightly rituals are more trouble than they're worth. As you found out, certain people freak out if you deviate from the routine. You're an adult. If anything had happened to you, your mom would have been contacted by the police.", "NTA, your mother barging in is unacceptable. I say change the locks and make sure your sister and mother do not have one. Maybe ones that can open via a code or a key?  Get a security system and possibly a big scary guard dog that will alert you in the event of someone coming into the house. I actually had someone break into my house when I was upstairs sleeping. My dog didn't do anything bark or growl. I adopted a German shepherd and now I feel a lot better and a lot safer in my house.", "NTA\n\nYou definitely need boundaries from her. It does sound like she was genuinely concerned, and wanting to check in on a loved one to make sure they are okay obviously isn't inherently a bad thing, but your mother sounds like she is way too attached to you and her jumping to all those conclusions and literally entering your house without permission (just because you didn't immediately text back) is a bit much. \n\nThe problem here obviously isn't her being concerned about you and wanting to make sure you are okay. That's normal. The issue is her being intrusive and being a worry wart to a degree that is a bit abnormal. All I can suggest is talking to her about needing boundaries. You won't know for certain how serious of a problem her behavior is unless you tell her how you feel and set some boundaries. If she refuses to listen and gets insanely defensive then the problem is far more serious and you may need to get your key back and/or change the locks and reduce contact with her.", "NTA. I feel like your mom's decision to come to your house in the middle of the night and barge in without permission or even knocking first was done for a few reasons. \n\n* The first was definitely about exerting control over you. She's showing you that in her mind, you still answer to her and have no right to privacy from her, even in your own home.\n\n* The second probably was an attempt to scare you as punishment for her self-inflicted \"worry\" because you weren't communicating on her timeline.\n\n* The third was likely an attempt to \"catch you in the act\" of doing something she wouldn't approve of, so she rushed into your house using her key to deny you an opportunity to hide something from her (like if you had a date over, or were drinking or something). \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation about this with your mom. Tell her that her overreaction and choice to barge in without even having the courtesy to knock shows that she doesn't see you as the independent adult you are. Tell her that you love her and know that she probably worries about you, but that it's her responsibility to manage those unreasonable fears, not your duty to be on-call to answer your phone 24/7. Then tell her that you're going to set some boundaries so that you can have a healthy, loving adult relationship with her. And set boundaries you're comfortable with -- for example, she has to wait 18 or 24 hours before coming over uninvited AND she has to knock before entering; you aren't going to do nighttime check-ins anymore; you will only text or call 2/3 times per week; add in anything else that will give you the freedom to live your own life while still being part of your family. And if she ignores your boundaries, you have to be willing to enforce them by reducing contact even more (for example, putting her on a \"time-out\" where you don't talk or see her for a week or more if she shows up uninvited, or you don't respond to her calls or texts outside of the designated times you promised to be available to her).\n\nAs someone else has recommended, get your keys back from your family and/or change your locks. My guess is that she's going to continue to feel entitled to \"check up on you\" regardless of how well you try to set boundaries. This will be a way to stop the behavior before it becomes a pattern. It might also help with your anxiety to know your home is secure and you won't be subconsciously anticipating your mom terrorizing you at night. \n\nIt's also an opportunity to evaluate your home security -- do you have extra locks or low-tech options like wooden dowels to make it difficult to open sliding doors or windows, for example? Would you feel better with a Ring doorbell or something similar to record anyone at your door? ... And so on.", "NTA. But you need to establish new boundaries with your mom. I get why she was concerned, since you always send her a good night text. Parents will always be genuinely concerned because that\u2019s part of the \u201cjob\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to be controlling. \n\nThe issue is not her coming over to check on you, but the whole dynamic behind the situation. \n\nYou are allowed to not answer immediately or even text everyday. You are an adult and she needs to understand that you have your own life.\n\nGet yourself an alarm to feel safe during the night and talk to her about new patterns of communication.", "yes", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like the teenager I was I sneaked into our home office and turned it on again.\nBut yeah she would get livid at me if she found out. And... One time she barged in when I was...
