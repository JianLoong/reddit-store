I simply wanted them to explain to him that what he did is not okay. So, I (18F) was warming up with the girls on the team I play on, while our coach was talking to the coach on the other team. After a while our coach walked over to us and told us that most of the girls on the other team used to or also play football, so they may play rough and get called up for it throughout the game(pushing us over and running into us and stuff like that, it's a non-contact sport)\n\nAbout halfway through the game the ball was down our end. I could of stood in the middle third but our attack was strong and I was more defence so I just stood on their end. When the coach of the other team moved closer (still on the sidelines) and called over a girl on his team that was standing a little in front of me in the middle of the court and she jogged over. I couldn't hear what he was saying to her but he pointed at me. I didn't walk over to listen in and seem creepy so I shrugged it off. \n\nThe ball was down their end and I was running trying to get the ball, all the players were all in one big crowd trying to grab it when I felt a hand grab my forearm and I felt burning pain down my arm from my wrist to my elbow. I looked down and there was three scratch marks across my arm stopping at my elbow. And it was bleeding. Bad. I eventually got her to let go. It was the girl the coach talked to during the game. I was caught off guard and she took this as an opportunity to stomp on my ankle hard. (I was wearing and ankle support on it, it was already very weak) their was so many players crowded trying to grab the ball somehow the umpires didn't see.\n\nAfter the game I told my mother what happened. She was angry and she called up their sporting club to complain, we knew the coaches name as he was wearing a name tag.\n\nAbout a week later we heard the news. His team was also located in our town and it's a pretty small country town and news travels fast here. We heard that he has been fired and that he had three little kids at home and he really had needed that job. I didn't WANT to get him fired. I just wanted him to have the rules explained to him.

His own coaching practices did. NTA", "It sounds like he got ***himself*** fired and that this wasn't the only issues he's had. 100% NTA.", "NTA fuck him.", "NTA: if he indeed instructed his player to attack you then he got himself fired", "he deserved to be fired. please remember that if he got fired, that means what he did was a firable offense, and would have happened regardless of anyhting. NTA, you are entirely blameless. actually, he should have been arrested.", "NTA he knew what he did was wrong. It's bad enough he warned your coach instead on ensuring his players stayed in line, but to encourage violence is absolutely unacceptable. He deserved to be fired. The was most likely not a one-off for him so he has and probably would continue causing players to get hurt. I hope his player that hurt you also faced consequences.", "NTA, the man got very invested in a non-contact sport (netball?) To the point where he told one of his players to go out of their way to hurt you which is vilified and disgusting in contact sports and there are certain techniques in combat sports that while legal are also seen as dirty for the same reason. I understand that he has kids, but he should have thought about those kids and the example he's setting for them with his actions. It is certainly no fault of yours that he faced those consequences, and it's not up to you to decide what his punishment is, so you should take that blame on either. With that being said, even though it's a very bad mistake, I doubt they'd have sacked him without some history of this sort of behaviour.", "NTA. Stop feeling guilty. You did not have the power to fire him. That decision came from his superiors. Of course it's sad that he had kids, but does that mean we should never report people who happen to be parents(rhetorical question)?", "NTA.  You didn't get him fired, HE got himself fired.  Who knows why exactly, but my comment still applies.", "Sounds like he's the asshole", "NTA- OP please realize you were probably not the first or second to make a complaint against him, that coach had to work hard to get himself fired like that. \n\nIf this doesn't help, then think about how many other girls will not be hurt now that he's out of coaching. Hopefully this also wakes up his wife to also realize what he is like and that she needs to re-evaluate their marriage.", "NTA, his un-sportsman like conduct got him fired. He can find a new job to support his children. Hopefully it won't be as a coach for anyone. I hope your arm and ankle heal up ok.", "Usually with these things, they find a paper trail/a pattern before firing people. Just your report probably isn\u2019t what got him fired. They most likely had more complaints about him, and this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Don\u2019t feel bad for him- his dangerous and meanspirited coaching is what got him fired. \n\nPlease consider the fact that he intentionally told another girl to injure you- just her stomping on your ankle could have altered your life forever. This could have been worse, and any punishment he receives is one he earned.\n\nNTA.", "NTA as a former coach from youth leagues up to college level,  there are coaches like that. The drive to win is more than what some people can logically handle.", "NTA \n\nI coached youth teams for many years.  We've had several examples where a coach was teaching his team how best to injure opponents when the refs are least likely to see it.  These guys are despicable and should be banned from youth sports.  Sadly, many of them never get called out or fired until after quite a few opposing players are injured.", "NTA. If he got fired that quickly, it tells me that this is not the first complaint about him. He was on his way out anyways because of his behavior as coach - you likely weren\u2019t the catalyst, but rather the last straw.\n\nAlso: good on your mom for standing up for you, and I\u2019m glad you told her what happened. Adults shouldn\u2019t be directing high schoolers to claw at each other and stomp ankles.", "NTA. You didn't get him fired, he did. He's a coach, he knew the the rules, he just didn't care and thought he could get away with breaking them, that's not your fault.", "NTA  \nYou are not responsible. He lost his job because of his unethical behavior.", "Did you make up any lies about his actions?\n  \nDid his actions cause harm to other people?\n  \nThe answer to these questions is \"no.\"\n  \nAnd here's another question:\n  \nHave there been any other complaints about this coach?\n  \nThe answer is probably \"yes\".\n  \nUnless you're the daughter of the mayor or something, one parental complaint is not going to get someone fired. This is probably just the latest in a series of complaints, and it wasn't just the latest, it was the last one.\n  \nNTA", "If he's putting hits out on the players on the other team he got what he deserved.  NTA.", "He didn't need to have the rules explained to him - he knew them perfectly well, and simply didn't think they applied to him. Further, I have a strong hunch that if he got fired it's because he is already known around the league for encouraging brutal behavior from his players. You did nothing wrong, and he got what he deserved. NTA.", "Nta. It players and coaches that ruin the game for everyone else. I played with people like this in gym classes kindergarten though grade 11. And now when people say team sports I say 'fuck no' I would rather do sport fighting because at least I go in mentally prepared for someone to try to hit me, and when you are trying to fight eachother people seem to respect the rules better.\nSo no nothing wrong with what you did if you had been looking for fight club you would have joined fight club", "NTA- that\u2019s called targeting and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re playing soccer. That\u2019s 100% not okay.", "I wish you were kidding. He was telling his players to hurt the competition. Did you enjoy your physical attack? Do you wish he would do that to others? Or are you just internalizing this because you fear consequences?", "Llll", "YTA. Obviously no coach should order their players to attack people, but how can you be sure he ordered the assault..  Maybe he was pointing you out as a match up for the other player and she took matters into her own hands and made the decision to harm you? You have every right to complain about your injury but your evidence is purely circumstantial. By your own admission you didn't hear what was said and the coach lost their job possibly because of your suspicions and  complaint.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was not OP who fired him, and she did not call to get him fired. As long as she told the truth, it\u2018s up to the other team to investigate the situation and decide about the next steps. I think it\u2019s rather safe to assume they did not take such a decision lightly. They would not have fired him without further investigations that proved the suspicion was correct. I guess they asked their player about the situation and she confirmed the suspicion. It is not plausible they fired him without even asking her. \n\nSpeculation: She probably did not enjoy the attack, most people wouldn\u2018t. Maybe she was even relieved that she could not be pressured into injuring others any longer. Maybe others in her team felt similarly.
