Tell the landlord that you have no interest in moving out but don't want to run into any trouble for not informing them of an extra tenant.  At least the landlord knows from you that you don't want to move out vs your roommate telling your landlord that OP is moving out so my girlfriend can move in.\n\nYou may have to pay extra for having a 3rd person living there but that is not your burden to pay.\n\nThis may cause strife with your roommate and soon it will be 2 against 1.

Then neither of you have to leave the area you're in :)\n\nBut that's a real thing though, typically apartment communities require that you make x3 the rent, gross income. So you would have to provide paystubs that show you make at least $5,550 a month or you wont qualify. Sometimes you can qualify if you have a lump sum savings equivalent to 6 months of rent (so you'd need $11,100 in the account).\n\nSome communities allow for a cosigner, but they sometimes are required to make x7 the rent (and are usually only offered for students).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a good step would be to talk to the community manager first and weigh out your options.", "NAH.\n\nNeither you nor your roommate has any special claim to the apartment, you're no more an asshole asking them to move out than they are for asking you - which is to day, none of you are assholes at all.

The first time you both have food poisoning or stomach flu you will thank me.", "i\u2019m driving so I\u2019m using voice to text for this comment if it doesn\u2019t make sense\n\nthis was my idea for my (now ex) bf when we talked about moving in together. He was still living at home with his dad, and I have a two bedroom apartment. I told him that he could move into the second bedroom, and we could Still share a bed at night if we\u2019d like, but we each have our own spaces. we also talked about maybe putting a small couch in there and both of our desks, and kind of just making it has a work from home room and half of \u201calone time room\u201d for if we ever need space. I know it\u2019s not easy living with someone for both of your guys\u2019s first time, so we were just trying to plan ahead for any future spats that might come about lol. I think it\u2019s a great idea, because I love to sleep alone sometimes, and I just like to have my own time to do my own thing. we would share one bathroom, but I used my desk as a vanity so I really got ready mainly at my desk, which is in my second bedroom. If we did separate bedrooms, I would\u2019ve moved my desk into my room. but yeah I think that\u2019s a great idea. but we broke up so I\u2019m happy we didn\u2019t move in together lol. When I get married and we get our first house before we have kids, and even after if we could, I wanna see each have our own little spaces that we could go to to get alone time. I think quality time spent together is important, but I also think it\u2019s important that each person can kind of be alone for a little bit when they want to. Especially because we both worked demanding jobs, especially because I worked 80 to 100 hours a week, and both of them where I was constantly talking to people. idk, i\u2019m currently single, but hopefully that\u2019s something I can do with my future significant other!", "My husband has his garage.

In my opinion, if a couple wants to move in together, then they need to FIND A PLACE together. Separate from the one you're staying in. THEY are the ones changing the living arrangement, not you.

It's fine for them to ask, but the whole point of asking is you're allowed to say no. You're not an asshole for not wanting to move--asking someone to move is asking a *lot*, even if the apartment was a less ideal situation than what it seems like you've currently got going on.

When I got married I moved out of the beautiful apartment my brother and I had got together. No questions asked, no discussion about it. I wasn't going to impose on him and in no way, shape or form was I going to ask him to leave because I had gotten married. \n\nAlso when that marriage blew up in my face and I couldn't stay in our apartment anymore, my brother was more than happy to let me move back in. Got my old room back and everything. ;\\_;", "Yes indeed, you want privacy with gf cool, but the nice thing to do here would be to move and not ask OP to move.", "This!", "Yeah moving costs a ton of time and money that I personally hate dealing with.

I mean, imagine if your roommate could kick you out anytime by telling the landlord you plan to leave and getting their own single lease!", "You would be a massive AH if you do did this. Just talk it out like fucking adults jesus", "And it's a jerk move to go to your landlord behind the current roommate's back.", "This. This should be asked more then straight votes.. also who paid the deposit? How are bills split? How long has gf been involved and/or stays over?

They've renewed every year (or however long the lease is for) so there's precedent for renewal. Wouldn't OP have to give notice of leaving? Wouldn't the landlord *ASK* OP before making a lease with someone else?", "Hence the NTA votes. I didn\u2019t read all the comments, but in those I did read, no one called Mark or the gf T A, either.

From a perfectly logical perspective the person making the change has to go, but if you are a true friend you try to do what's best for everyone. There can be a legit compromise where everyone benefits which is why I suggested the people wanting to stay sweetens the deal.
