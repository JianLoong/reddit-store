It's fine for them to want to live alone as a couple, and to prefer to remain. It's just as fine for you to want to live alone and remain in the apartment. IMO, they are the ones who should leave, as they're the ones making the change that necessitates someone leaving. You offered to let them remain there as a couple, so if they don't like that then they should find somewhere that doesn't have an existing tenant and rent that space.", "No you would not be the AH.  It's as much your apartment as it is his, & you're very content where you are.  If they want to live together they should be the ones to find a place.", "NAH.  They're free to ask, you're free to say no.\n\nIn the end they're the ones who want to make a big change and they are the ones who need ti sacrifice and find a new place and you aren't required to sacrifice stuff in your life to make their want of a change to happen.", "NTA \n\nBefore talking to them talk to the landlord and be honest. Especially about him moving another person into the apartment and now the two of them wanting you out. Let\u2019s face it couples break up all the time and the gf was never on the lease and they may have violated it by moving her in.\n\nA single tenant is a lot less headaches.", "NTA but can you afford the place on your own or would you need a new roommate? If you can afford the place on your own then I would contact the landlord. \n\nAsk them if your roommate needs to add their girlfriend to the lease since he wants her to move in or simply informing the landlord is enough. Tell the landlord that you have no interest in moving out but don't want to run into any trouble for not informing them of an extra tenant.  At least the landlord knows from you that you don't want to move out vs your roommate telling your landlord that OP is moving out so my girlfriend can move in.\n\nYou may have to pay extra for having a 3rd person living there but that is not your burden to pay.\n\nThis may cause strife with your roommate and soon it will be 2 against 1. So you are going to have a hostile environment since they want you gone.", "NTA - I don't think you're an AH for asking them to move, but if he signed for it with you, you both have an obligation to fulfill the contracted lease.    He's the one that wants changes, so if you want to stay, stay.   If he wants to be alone, he needs to find other accommodations.   Could you afford the rent on your own, that might be another consideration.", "Other perspective, either party could just talk to the leasing consultant in the office and let them know that you or your roommate is moving out at the end of the lease and see if there will be a different unit in the same complex available. Then neither of you have to leave the area you're in :)\n\nBut that's a real thing though, typically apartment communities require that you make x3 the rent, gross income. So you would have to provide paystubs that show you make at least $5,550 a month or you wont qualify. Sometimes you can qualify if you have a lump sum savings equivalent to 6 months of rent (so you'd need $11,100 in the account).\n\nSome communities allow for a cosigner, but they sometimes are required to make x7 the rent (and are usually only offered for students).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a good step would be to talk to the community manager first and weigh out your options.", "NAH.\n\nNeither you nor your roommate has any special claim to the apartment, you're no more an asshole asking them to move out than they are for asking you - which is to day, none of you are assholes at all.  Stay civil, but assert that you have just as much right to stay as they do.\n\nYou should keep an eye out for alternative apartments in any case - mostly for your own benefit, but if you see something they might like you should let them know (no matter who keeps the apartment, it's evident it will not be both of you). Hopefully they extend you the same  courtesy.", "NTA. Whoever wants to change things up is who has to find somewhere else. They can\u2019t just boot you.", "NAH. I honestly don't get the N T A votes. It doesn't seem like Mark demanded you move out. He asked. If you don't, it seems like he would have to move out. And I don't think you're an asshole for saying no.", "NTA, just tell them that no, you are going to stay in the apartment you have been leasing.  Let Mark know that you will not hold it against them if they want to move, and you are fine if they want to stay, as long as they remain good roommates, but that no, you will not be leaving your home.", "NTA", "NTA.  They want to change the living situation - so they should be the ones to leave.  Check with the landlord to find out if there are other apartments available in the building.  Maybe there is a one bedroom for less in the building - that you could move into.  Or a two-bedroom, that they can move to. Or an adjacent building to consider.  However, you should not have to be the one to move if you don't want to.", "The point it's another: the lease Is ending and they are 2, you are One.

If not, I doubt the landlord cares so long as they get paid", "one because then he only have one tenant instead of two", "as a former landlord- one. two people cause more wear and tear on an apartment.", "Why would a landlord prefer 2 people over 1 when the rent is the same either way?

He is happy for them all to keep living there and the roommate doesn't want that, therefore, the roommate should leave", "Right. They have equal rights to it.

No assholes, just figure it out between themselves. Nothing in the OP suggests that there is any anger, just wanting different things.

So they want to all the burden on him.", "Just offering a different perspective as OP keeps mentioning he wants to stay as it\u2019s convenient to HIS work but it\u2019s more convenient to their work so that\u2019s not a valid argument\u2026 isn\u2019t Reddit for getting different opinions?!", "Yeah, I know.", "I don't think I'm being a grammar Nazi by letting someone know that the word they wrote means the opposite of what they intended.", "You've again glossed over the point that they want to make the change, if it was that op decided they wanted to live alone, then you would be right that he should change. However they don't, op is happy to remain in the current arrangement, it's the roommate that wants a change, ergo they should be the one to make it, rather than attempting to force it on a 3rd party.", "Everyone here knew what they meant.", "\"resign\" is not the opposite of \"re-sign\". I've never heard someone say \"resign the lease\" when talking about cancelling or not re-signing."]}
