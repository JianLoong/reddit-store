Tell the landlord that you have no interest in moving out but don't want to run into any trouble for not informing them of an extra tenant.  At least the landlord knows from you that you don't want to move out vs your roommate telling your landlord that OP is moving out so my girlfriend can move in.\n\nYou may have to pay extra for having a 3rd person living there but that is not your burden to pay.\n\nThis may cause strife with your roommate and soon it will be 2 against 1.

Then neither of you have to leave the area you're in :)\n\nBut that's a real thing though, typically apartment communities require that you make x3 the rent, gross income. So you would have to provide paystubs that show you make at least $5,550 a month or you wont qualify. Sometimes you can qualify if you have a lump sum savings equivalent to 6 months of rent (so you'd need $11,100 in the account).\n\nSome communities allow for a cosigner, but they sometimes are required to make x7 the rent (and are usually only offered for students).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a good step would be to talk to the community manager first and weigh out your options.", "NAH.\n\nNeither you nor your roommate has any special claim to the apartment, you're no more an asshole asking them to move out than they are for asking you - which is to day, none of you are assholes at all.

Same rent, less wear and tear on the apartment.", "So are you the girlfriend?", "Not self centred at all. If you would co own a beautiful apartment and then your co owner would like you to move out despite there still being space for all of y\u2019all you\u2019d say no.\n\nHe wants a different living situation, he should create himself one without kicking others out", "Wtaf?!\n\n\"It's convenient\" and \"I like it here\" and \"its pretty affordable\" are ... literally the best reasons to stay in an apartment. \n\nLol, that comment is insanely ridiculous", "Moving is such a hassle, OP doesn't have to move to accommodate other people's wishes.

Why does a couple \"need\" 2 bedroom housing?

They're both been on the lease for the same amount of time so they're both have the same claim as to the apartment. Asking your roommate to move out so you can move someone else in is wrong.

You should never expect a roommate to move just because YOU decided to make a change. How entitled of ~~you~~ oops, I mean the couple. NTA, OP.", "He would probably fine a new roommate. The quest is whether he or his roommate should be the one to move. Both find it more convenient to stay. His roommate is also only thinking of his own comfort. The one who wants to change the status quo should be the one to shoulder the inconvenience.", ">its convenient\n\nIt's convenient is enough of a reason to want to stay, why should OP find another living arrangement when he is already ok with the current one.

The fucking nerve. The unmitigated gall.", "You're ignoring the cost, the neighborhood, and the inconvenience of moving.", "They can just move to a different apartment in the complex most likely. They\u2019re changing things. It\u2019s not self centered to expect them to be the ones to leave. They don\u2019t want to live with OP anymore. OP is fine with all 3 of them staying.

The person who wants a change has to be the one to go.  Roomie is reneging on the original deal.

Its not rocket science here. Hes been there for 4 years now he doesnt have to change a damn thing about his situation. They are the ones throwing a curveball.

They wanna move in together, they can find someplace else.", "Bingo.", "Not only moving itself, but the unknowns surrounding a new apartment.  Even if OP found a place in the same neighborhood, the new building might not be as nice, maintenance staff not as responsive, the walls could be paper thin and suddenly noisy neighbors are an issue.

I found my \"perfect neighborhood\" when I moved to a bigger city 10 years ago, but it took me living in four different apartment buildings to find the perfect home.
