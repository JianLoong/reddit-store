Tell the landlord that you have no interest in moving out but don't want to run into any trouble for not informing them of an extra tenant.  At least the landlord knows from you that you don't want to move out vs your roommate telling your landlord that OP is moving out so my girlfriend can move in.\n\nYou may have to pay extra for having a 3rd person living there but that is not your burden to pay.\n\nThis may cause strife with your roommate and soon it will be 2 against 1.

Then neither of you have to leave the area you're in :)\n\nBut that's a real thing though, typically apartment communities require that you make x3 the rent, gross income. So you would have to provide paystubs that show you make at least $5,550 a month or you wont qualify. Sometimes you can qualify if you have a lump sum savings equivalent to 6 months of rent (so you'd need $11,100 in the account).\n\nSome communities allow for a cosigner, but they sometimes are required to make x7 the rent (and are usually only offered for students).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a good step would be to talk to the community manager first and weigh out your options.", "NAH.\n\nNeither you nor your roommate has any special claim to the apartment, you're no more an asshole asking them to move out than they are for asking you - which is to day, none of you are assholes at all.

He was still living at home with his dad, and I have a two bedroom apartment. I told him that he could move into the second bedroom, and we could Still share a bed at night if we\u2019d like, but we each have our own spaces. we also talked about maybe putting a small couch in there and both of our desks, and kind of just making it has a work from home room and half of \u201calone time room\u201d for if we ever need space. I know it\u2019s not easy living with someone for both of your guys\u2019s first time, so we were just trying to plan ahead for any future spats that might come about lol. I think it\u2019s a great idea, because I love to sleep alone sometimes, and I just like to have my own time to do my own thing. we would share one bathroom, but I used my desk as a vanity so I really got ready mainly at my desk, which is in my second bedroom. If we did separate bedrooms, I would\u2019ve moved my desk into my room. but yeah I think that\u2019s a great idea. but we broke up so I\u2019m happy we didn\u2019t move in together lol. When I get married and we get our first house before we have kids, and even after if we could, I wanna see each have our own little spaces that we could go to to get alone time. I think quality time spent together is important, but I also think it\u2019s important that each person can kind of be alone for a little bit when they want to. Especially because we both worked demanding jobs, especially because I worked 80 to 100 hours a week, and both of them where I was constantly talking to people. idk, i\u2019m currently single, but hopefully that\u2019s something I can do with my future significant other!", "My husband has his garage.

If not, have you looked for a different housemate? Given that it is an apartment complex have you talked to the management company about whether there is an option for either them or you to move into a different unit in the same building?\n\nThe reality here is that if both of you say you want to stay in the apartment, it\u2019s going to come down to who signs a new lease with the landlord/property management company first. If both of your names are on the lease it will likely be a new lease and the rent may go up, regardless, so factor that in. Depending on what the housing market looks like, it\u2019s possible a landlord won\u2019t want to renew with you and a new person or him and a new person (his girlfriend) if they can list it for more anyway.  So figuring out the terms to get the right names on the right lease probably makes sense. If they can easily get approved and sign a new lease and you cannot do so on your own, then you\u2019ll probably need to move. If you\u2019d get approved on your own or have a new housemate ready to sign the lease then it just comes down to whether you can talk to the landlord first. Depending on whether you\u2019ve been month to month for years, signing yearly leases, etc. a lot of this is going to depend on both of your resources. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d suggest contacting the property manager or landlord. Ask about similar units in the building and also ask about one bedrooms or studios. Don\u2019t yet tell them anyone is moving out. This is going to be easiest if there is a similar unit that either you or they can move into. Since Mark\u2019s girlfriend will have to move into the building anyway whether into the current apartment or a new one, approaching Mark with the option of moving into a similar unit in the same building and offering to help him move is a very easy way to handle things. Similarly, if you ask to stay with them until a one bedroom or studio opens up that you can move into (assuming there will be one with the first few months after the lease ends) that\u2019s also an easy solution/ fair ask. This could all be resolved by all of you finding a way to stay in the building. \n\nIf there isn\u2019t a similar or appropriate unit, then you can tell them you\u2019d like to stay, they\u2019ll either agree or disagree. If they disagree then it is a race to contact the landlord and sign a new lease. This may or may not become adversarial.  This is why being prepared and ready to sign a new lease makes sense. If they can go to the landlord and sign with their dual income but you won\u2019t qualify on your own and don\u2019t have a housemate ready to sign then it might be time to look for a new place/ you\u2019re probably out of luck. On the other hand, if you can sign a new lease and are prepared to do so they may just be out of luck.\n\nYou can and obviously should start by doing the polite, ethical thing given that you\u2019ve lived together peacefully for four years and reach a consensus before talking to the landlord but it also doesn\u2019t hurt to be prepared for how you\u2019ll swoop in if things go sideways. They\u2019ll either agree to move or say they want to stay. You\u2019ll have to decide how far you\u2019re willing to go to ensure you stay. The most extreme/ aggressive move is signing a new lease out from under them. The most passive move is just agreeing to move if they say they want to stay. Assuming everyone is a reasonable person, there is probably a solution somewhere in the middle and even a way to leave everyone satisfied (example: they get the apartment but let you stay for a month rent free while you move into a new place, you get the apartment but help them move/ let them keep some shared furniture). All of it will depend on the level of friendship and how far you\u2019re each willing to go to get your way.\n\nAlso, something to consider: Your housemate is making the change so in most circumstances he is the one who should be the one to move. However, you should also consider other factors here. If, for example, he put in the work to find the place way back when or if he\u2019s put in work to maintain the apartment that you have not, owns all the things in the apartment that you\u2019ve been using, etc. that might be information you factor in when considering how aggressive you want to be with this. To explain what I mean: let\u2019s say he spent months finding the perfect apartment for the two of you, bought all the furniture, paid slightly more in rent, and added touches and upgrades beyond a normal renter then expecting him to be the one to move all his furniture out and forgo the work he put in when you can move out with just a carload of stuff might be legally okay, but will probably be inconsiderate enough to be relationship ending between the two of you.", "NTA\u2014", "NTA.
