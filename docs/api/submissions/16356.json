Someone like him will definitely find a way to ruin the wedding anyway. Like stealing from the estate. It's probably best for everyone that he doesn't come anywhere near the place.

You did nothing wrong and are doing nothing wrong by not wanting him around. \n\nFWIW my BIL is an ex con. Definitely an ex (now works for a sheriff department in a support capacity), but he is estranged from my partner. The parents still want everyone to get along, but no longer force the issue.

They are putting you in an awful position, especially as they are threatening to bring him whether you invite him or not.\n\nPersonally, I would go full nuclear and tell them that you have explained, objectively, why you did not invite him and if they cannot respect your decision, especially given their threat to bring him, then it is probably better if they all stay away, as much as this would hurt you.\n\nUnless you draw a line in the sand, the only choice you will have is to employ some kind of security to ensure he does not come on to the property, at which point, no doubt, your family will leave anyway.\n\nYWNBTA at all and I do not envy the position you are in nor the decision you will have to make.", "NTA, i would tell them they can either accept that your brother is not welcome, or they can hoin him in not being invited. as others have suggested, if you can afford it, i would recommend getting security in case they try to sneak him in. congrats on the big day.", "nta", "NTA.

What is the end game? That their family gets back together. Your brother doesn\u2019t care about how you or others view him and your parents and sister are enablers.

I shot back \" he raped a kid, why would anyone invite him?\" My MIL actually said \" well, you don't have to say it like that!\" Families sometimes will downplay to themselves, you refusing just makes them face the truth.
