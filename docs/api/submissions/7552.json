Last year there was a late cancellation in his group and he asked if I wanted to be a quick fill for the vacancy in his foursome.  The fee was already paid by the guy who dropped out - I said sure!\n\nAfter the round there was also a dinner + drinks and some additional raffle/auction opportunities including a 50/50 raffle.  I thought this would be a good opportunity to give a little something to the cause and hey, maybe I would win the raffle too.  My friend declined and sort of smirked as I forked over some cash and later explained that it\u2019s a facade because every year the winner makes a show of donating their winnings to the charity.\n\nSo of course I won the raffle.  The MC calls me up, hands me the manilla envelope with the cash winnings (which turned out to be A LOT) and asks me what I\u2019m going to do with it.  I was extremely nervous so naturally I just said the first thing that popped into my head which also happened to be the truth - \u201cThis will definitely help with the rent, hehe!\u201d.  There were a couple of chuckles and the MC was kind of shifting awkwardly.  The MC cleared his throat and then restated the amount of money on the mic that was raised which of course matched what I won.  \u201cX dollars for charity, and X dollars for rent!\u201d - drew some more laughter and light applause.  I head for my table and somebody says \u201creally?\u201d.  As I\u2019m taking my seat I noticed another of the organizers had headed up to the mic.  Made a comment to the effect that he was so blown away by the generous donations that he wanted to match the 50/50 raffle donation.  This of course brought out a lot of great applause and then the MC announced the revised raffle amount\u2026\u201d2X dollars for charity!\u201d...big applause\u2026\u201dand even X dollars for rent!\u201d...which of course brought out quite a facetious reaction, especially for a recycled joke now.\n\nThere\u2019s more.  The manilla envelope was empty.  I showed my friend and another guy at our table sees this, stands up and yells \u201chey MC, we need that rent money over on table five!\u201d  The MC comes over, looking both annoyed and amused.  Apologizes for the awkwardness both at the mic and with the envelope and says they just need to sort out the money one more time.  A couple drinks later, MC is back with the money in a different envelope and hands it to me with a comment to the effect of \u201cif rent is so tight be careful gambling what you can\u2019t afford to lose\u201d...so I tried to explain how I was invited and appreciated the chance to golf and contribute a bit via the raffle.  MC gave a very revelatory nod to this info.\n\nThe evening ends with a whimper not long after.  My friend recently let me know that beginning this year any substitutions to a group must now be personally approved by the organizers.\n\nI definitely got some YTA vibes from a number of people that evening but maybe I\u2019m overthinking it.

But that's some shady shit, having unvoiced expectations.", "As an ED of a nonprofit, it is not unheard of for winners of cash prizes to donate all or a portion of it back to the cause, but it should NOT be expected. \n\n The fact they gave you an empty envelope (which I believe was on purpose) directly violates the raffle permit they have with city/village the event was held in\u2026which can get them in trouble as it is meant to ensure fraud/scams are not occurring. I absolutely, cannot imagine doing this. As someone mentioned it is classless and distasteful\u2026and honestly, some of my orgs most committed donors are past raffle winners. This is not a stain on you, but them.", "NTA. Your friend should have told you what the deal was WHEN you were buying the ticket, not afterward. It's clear this group has an expectation that the raffle will be additional fundraising rather than a real prize, but people who don't have a relationship with the charity can't be expected to know that.", "NTA. Can you say deceptive advertising? What a joke. Why pay for a raffle ticket when it is a foregone conclusion, that regardless of the ticket drawn, the money will not actually be awarded to the winner.\n\nIt will be interesting how they handle this faux raffle next year.", "NTA\n\nI'd take this story to the media.

This is a rich guy event where they make themselves look richer by throwing around money frivolously.\n\nAbout 2007 (pre-housing market crash), I volunteered at a local PTO fundraiser.  The whole event was a way for \"rich\" guys to make themselves look richer by publicly wasting money  (bidding thousands of dollars to buy a platter decorated by the entire class when the wife was admitting they hadn't hung last year's platter yet).  I sat with the school staff and it was frankly embarrassing.\n\nThere were even other parents who dogged me because I made a modest donation and volunteered at the event instead of buying a ticket to attend and making a larger donation.\n\nRoughly 15 years later, many of those couples are divorced and/or having money struggles.  Spending/donating lavishly doesn't lead to wealth accumulation.

The event is literally to raise money for a cause.", "Sorry to say, yta when it's a charity event.", "Okay. Against the grain YTA. \n\nI think this is a *when in rome* situation. Clearly, people buying tickets did so with the intent - based on culture and tradition of the event - that they were giving their money to charity. It was a sort of social contract amongst a subsociety. You partook and learned about that contract, in advance of the draw and with time to change your participation (you could have pulled someone aside and asked to sell them your ticket), but chose to keep participating. \n\nYou then violated the contract by keeping the winnings. \n\nSo while I'm not disputing what you did was within the letter of the law, it was not within the spirit.

Yes, that is the traditional move when you win cash at a charity event. You always donate it back to the charity.

One little old lady has, for the past 30 years, made a very notable pie and donated it to the raffle at the event.\n\nEveryone always bids it up, so it ended up being a $100 pie, but then some ten years ago or so, the person who won \"donated\" the pie back to the raffle, and they raffled it again...  last year the pie got raffled 11 times before the person who won it decided to keep it!\n\nNobody blamed that person for keeping it.  Everyone understands that the other people who win and donate it back are just biding on the pie because they find it to be more fun than just writing a check to the event.  The charity was going to get a ~$100 check from all those people anyway, they just found it more amusing to \"donate\" via the raffle process.\n\nThe whole thing sounds exhausting to me.  I've always thought it was illogical for people to make their favorite charities jump through the hoops of having dinners and runs and events, why not just look at your budget and make a donation?  But apparently these events make people spend more than they otherwise would because charities keep holding them...  or similarly, rich people want to hold fancy dinners, but feel bad if they don't have a good enough excuse \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOP is NTA.
