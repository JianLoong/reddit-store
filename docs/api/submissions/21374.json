You wouldn\u2019t be responsible for break-ins and similar things anyhow, that remains the responsibility of the people who do the breaking in and such.  If you\u2019re worried about things like falling tree limbs, gravel breaking windshields, flooding, and other things where you might be responsible, you could put up signs that say \u201cPark here at your own risk.  Land owner assumes no liability for vehicle damages\u201d and then tell the neighbors that they can use the gravel lot as long as they understand that you\u2019re not responsible for any damage that results from using it.", "NTA. Your property, your rules, that's it.\n\nBut if you want to keep friendly relationships with your neighbors, maybe you could draw up a contract or something that absolves you of responsibility. But no you're not an AH if you'd just rather not.", "Just make that clear if that\u2019s your only concern and if that\u2019s are okay with that let them", "Given you only have 4 neighbours and plenty of space. Sorry dude, YWBTH. If your worried about being liable. Just get them to sign something that says as a courtesy you\u2019re letting them park there, but you\u2019re responsible for nothing and they assume all the risk.", "Small yta. Yes, liability is something to seriously worry about. But even just having them sign something saying I am parking here at my own risk will help you skeep at night. You are under no obligations, but being neighbourly in a small town will follow you for years.", "NTA that's a good fear to have. I would consider it if I could get them to sign something saying I won't be held liable for stuff like that. or text me so I have proof", "You would not be liable for a break in (NAL). If you don't dislike the neighbors, make them the offer and even have them sign a release if it makes you feel better.\n\nYTA if you don't.  In a small community, you don't want to be labeled as the AH neighbor.", "YTA - If your worry is about liability, you can download a boilerplate waiver of liability from several free sites.", "YTA. You are not liable for a crime occurring on your property. There is no good reason to not let your neighbors park at your house.", "YTA mildly. This seems a genuine case of the neighbors needing somewhere to park, and I'd say the decent neighborly thing to do is let them. You never know when you might need something some day, and people tend to have long memories....", "NTA, your yard.  There is also the constant coming and going of cars that will start to drive you crazy.  The beep of setting the alarm system, possible loud music as they pull in.  Are they able access their own lots from the alley, so what if they have to park on their own grass, it will grow back.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t the town or county have to work in a way that doesn\u2019t block access for long?", "I don\u2019t think you can be called an asshole for not letting someone do something on your property if you don\u2019t want it.  If the lot is far away from your home and their parking won\u2019t inconvenience you, I\u2019d go ahead and do it to be neighborly.  But I\u2019d have the explicit conversation in advance that I\u2019m not responsible for anything.\n\nSo NTA, but if you\u2019d appreciate it being done for you, why not do it for others?  If you can.", "NTA. Have they asked?", "NTA in the pure sense that you don\u2019t have to let them park on your driveway and it wouldn\u2019t be a full blown TA move to decline. \n\nBUT you could easily avoid any liability either with a simple written waiver or even just a typical sign posted on your property like you see in private parking lots, and living in a small community and turning down neighbors on a favor that isn\u2019t going to terribly inconvenience you might not be in your best interest, since it\u2019s always good to be owed a favor in case you end up in a pinch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just like if I have a pool and a neighbors kid goes swimming when I'm not around without permission and gets hurt, even though they are trespassing they can still sue me.", "Yeah this spot on. If they just parked there without asking I'd wouldn't allow it, but if they're asking in advance, and it's not going to be an inconvenience in the slightest, you're setting yourself up for problems down the line if you say no.", "I think you're overestimating how long it takes to resurface a road.
