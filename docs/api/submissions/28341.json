There\u2019s this girl (name) who\u2019s autistic and I chat with her often because she\u2019s very nice and has a hard time making friends.\n\nThere\u2019s a study area that I go to for studying because I\u2019ve heard that studying in your dorm room is distracting. I found a nice little spot there hidden from everyone so I\u2019m not distracted. One day (name) found me there and wanted to chat. I had fun and talked with her.\n\nThe next day I\u2019m sitting at the spot and she comes up. I make small talk but then tell her that I have to focus on studying so I can\u2019t chat anymore. She said ok, but proceeded to stand right above me staring at what I was doing. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude and ignore her so I just chatted with her until she went away. This proceeded to happen several more times throughout the week. She would walk up to me and when I tried to hint at her to go away, she would continue to talk to me.\n\nYesterday I went to the study spot and she was sitting there. I acted nice, I know it\u2019s not MY spot obviously, so I found another one on the other side of the building. She. Found It. And talked to me. I took off my headphones and told her that I like her as a person but I can\u2019t keep talking like this when I need to study. I\u2019ll admit I had a rude tone of voice because I was very annoyed. She started to get visibly upset and overwhelmed. She said that she wants to spend time with me. I got really stressed out not sure what to do, so I got up to leave. She grabbed my bag and I grabbed her wrist to remove her hand. She started yelling and making noises. I made a scared noise and then practically jogged away. I remember this moment for moment because I feel so bad about it.\n\nShe told her mom, who contacted someone, and now I have a scheduled meeting with the communications advisor next week. She emailed me about it and said she wanted to ask me some questions about the \u201cincident\u201d that happened with my classmate. I have no idea what she told her, and I feel horrible. She must have felt extremely rejected and upset, and I was so rude just because I was annoyed. AITA?\n\nEdit it\u2019s important for me to make it clear that she wasn\u2019t trying to steal my backpack or hurt me by grabbing me. When I turned around after she grabbed it, she was smiling. I think she was trying to have fun with me but didn\u2019t understand that I was very bothered", "created_utc": 1696609334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171got4/aita_for_snapping_at_an_autistic_girl_because_she/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let your parents know what happened. Don't go into meeting without talking to someone first. Like your parents or an attorney. You don't know what this girl could be accusing you of.

You should just tell the truth. You did tell her to respect your boundary and she didnt.", "You tried communicate with her and then she grabbed your bag to force you to stay with her. It\u2019s no different if she grabbed you by the shirt instead. That kind of confrontation is scary and you had to leave for your own safety and the only way to was to remove her hand away. She\u2019s practically stalking you too. Tell them the truth and avoid her to protect yourself from future incidents. NTA", "NTA. Although a word of advice, don't hint anything to autistic people. It's better to be upfront and exact in what you mean and want. Of course her reaction was not acceptable, but know this just in case.", "be sure to tell them the only reason you grabbed her hand was because she grabbed your bag, and that you had told her you wanted to be left alone before she did that. \n\nif she is in a spot where she can\u2019t be touched, she should have an intimate understanding of how scary it is when someone tries to prevent you from leaving. if that is beyond her, she needs to learn. if she can\u2019t learn that, she can\u2019t be in a place where she\u2019s left without supervision around other people. \n\nbeing autistic is not a carte blanche to steamroll people\u2019s boundaries, and i\u2019m pretty sure most autistic people would agree with me on that. \n\nshe\u2019s young, hopefully this will be the thing that teaches her this lesson, but you softening the message will do her no favors. she\u2019ll have an easier time making friends if she learns to respect boundaries. \n\nnta.", "Just tell the school exactly what you told us. She was following you. She grabbed you to keep you from leaving, you did what you had to do to extract yourself from a situation.\n\nMake sure you use this language: \"She consistently made me feel uncomfortable, followed me to multiple locations, then tried to prevent me from extracting myself from what felt like a hostile situation.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA overall, was leaning N A H until the last exchange. you\u2019re there to study and you told her on the second occurrence \u201cI am here to study and I cannot chat right now.\u201d (Name) is in college, which means she\u2019s been through at least 18 years of life. Autistic or not that was pretty direct (while still polite) and she should know better than to continue to stand over you staring while you study\u2026..\n\nBUT I think since you chatted with her that first time she saw that time/place as your social time together. Instead of shutting it down and turning back to your studies I think you could have recognized that and, instead of chatting with her to not be rude, you could have said \u201chey I have this test/paper/lab/quiz/whatever that I really need to study for. I would love to get lunch and chat once that is over with and I can concentrate on our conversation fully. Are you available Saturday?\u201d This tactic could have worked every time she approached you including the \u201cincident\u201d time\n\nHowever, now that her parents have made it something official, all bets are off. You need to protect yourself and your future. Make sure you have a parent or attorney in the meeting with you. Prep for this meeting. Was there a witness? The more details you provide the better.", "NTA and start documenting all communications.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to speak up and tell your side of the interaction, and you probably should have done that proactively, even if she hadn't said anything to her mother and caused this meeting to be requested.  Her not getting your social cues or not listening to your explicit and clear requests is a bit of a problem, but her grabbing at you when you are trying to walk away is a whole other issue and brings YOUR safety into question.", "NTA. \n\nLast time I checked, autism is NOT a free pass to get away with everything.", "NTA. You tried to be polite and explain you needed space but she persisted and then grabbed your bag. I think you feel badly because you know she might miss social cues but you did nothing wrong. I'm sorry you're being called in for a meeting but be calm and direct in your explanation.", "NTA but I can understand why the girl was confused. You were indirect and tried to hint things to her instead of telling her directly what you needed. She didn't pick up on those hints and despite once mentioning that you needed to study, you also kept chatting with her. The message she got was that you enjoyed chatting with her and would prefer to do that even if you said you had studying to do. She had NO IDEA you were stressed or trying to stop chatting with her. \n\nI am not saying that you did anything objectively wrong here but as someone who was diagnosed with autism in middle age, it does make me sad sometimes to think about all the times someone was getting increasingly frustrated with me about something I had no idea was bothering them. I missed the subtle hints and then all of a sudden they would blow up without warning (in my view anyway) and I'd have no idea what I did wrong. If they had just told me directly from the beginning, I would have just said 'ok'and stopped doing the thing they didn't like. \n\nI understand that direct communication can be uncomfortable for people at times. But it is necessary for those of us who are autistic in order to know what you want us to know. It would honestly be really great if everyone could work on being a little more direct and I think a lot of communication issues would be resolved more quickly if we all did that.", "NTA  \nI get that you feel bad but you need to document every detail immediately and prepare for this meeting. It would suck for you to face disciplinary action or expulsion for this.", "NTA I can\u2019t stand people like this who decide to make their own issues everyone else\u2019s. She hugely invaded your privacy and then proceeded to try to report you for upsetting her? Very entitled and annoying. \n\nJust make sure you tell your family and student advice what actually happened", "NTA. It sounds like you did everything you could to set boundaries with her and she continued to cross them. While I think some of the earlier interactions are NAH and seem to be just issues of communication, the last incident escalated in a way that is pretty unacceptable and you shouldn't have to deal with negative consequences for it. You need to make sure that you let them know that you tried to be nice, you tried to explain to her multiple times that you needed to be left alone to study, and even changed your own routine to try and maintain your boundaries and only got short with her after all of that. And make sure that you don't let anyone convince you that protecting yourself and trying to remove yourself from a situation where she was clearly losing control and making you uncomfortable is not okay. Most of us would get frustrated and short with someone who kept ignoring us asking to be left alone.", "NTA - She grabbed your bag and prevented you from leaving.  She was not responding to verbal instructions that you did not want to talk right now.  She may want to spend time with you, but you do not want to spend time with her.  This is a two yes one no thing.  \n\nYou aren't obligated to spend time with her.  Expecting her to pick up on social cues that would indicate you were done talking wouldn't have worked but you told her several times you did not want to talk right now.  This is real life.  You can say you are sorry you aren't interested in the same kind of friendship that she is, but that you are prioritizing your studies and you need your time and choices to be respected.  \n\nNo means no even if you're autistic.", "Nta. coming from an autistic female, boundaries are hard to understand as well as body language. I do know that with the correct words, it would really help. You're not the asshole because you didn't know what to do. You wondered it as well as you could, so I don't understand why she would go to grab you when you walked up to walk away. I don't know what she was thinking as every autistic is different but your definitely NTA", "NTA,\n\nI would open the meeting with \"hi, I want to reassure you that I don't plan to file against her for assault and battery if that was your concern\". \n\nThis would set the tone of the meeting immediately, and catch them off guard.\n\nOn the plus side, what she did was effectively assualt and battery, so you do actually have a claim.\n\nIf you don't go on the offense, you'll get trampled over.", "NTA but you said you *hinted* at not wanting her around while studying, she most likely did not pick up this. You need to be direct, \u201cwhen I come to this spot it\u2019s for quiet alone time to study and I want to keep it that way but if you ever see me at (spot you frequent socially) please come say hi. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, but subtly telling an autistic person something or trying to get them to read between the lines will typically not work. They expected you to greet them as you have all the other times, your response was probably confusing and shocking causing a meltdown. The way they reacted isn\u2019t okay, just trying to give some insight.", "You did nothing wrong, the only thing here is that you actually never told her \"Hey, when I'm studying I want to be alone, I like hang out with you but please leave me alone when I'm studying or as\u00ed me if I like to be alone when I'm studying\".\n\nAutistic/Neurodivergent folks usually don't get the hints so is better a direct approach. I know because I'm like that.", "Ok. So there's a bit to unpack here.\n\nYou gave her social cues that you didn't want to talk and got frustrated when she didn't receive them as you expected.\n\nThis tension grew until you released that tension.\n\nThis part - don't send social cues. Just say what you need.\nWith definite statements and, keep you integrity. So she stood over you, watching. Tell that you didn't feel okay with her doing so. It's really hard to know unless one is told.\nEspecially if one can't read social cues.\n\n\nAs for grabbing you. Obviously didn't respect your boundary.NTA.", "NAH you didn\u2019t do anything malicious, this seems like a miscommunication because she needed to be dealt with in a different way and you don\u2019t have the tools to do that. \n\nAsk the communication services person what the intent and purpose of the meeting is. If it\u2019s just to have someone help the situation and youre not in trouble I would explain the situation and then go to the meeting trying to find a solution to the miscommunication. If your get reprimanded by the school I wouldn\u2019t go and check into what powers the school has in this situation. \n\nIf you got the tools to better set boundaries with your friend, would you want to continue the friendship.", "Take someone with you to that meeting. Even a friend.", "you don't Have to be friends with Anyone.\nregardless of whatever they have going on.\nyou don't Have to.\ntell the school what happened, lay out your boundaries, and if they don't respect them, go to a public library to avoid the person.\nnta", "NTA \n\nBeing autistic is the reason social cues that are obvious to neurotypicals aren't easy to pick up. It is not an excuse to hold people socially hostage and disregard their words.", "NAH\n\nShe probably didn't quite understand because you had talked like that multiple times previously that week and you (understandably) didn't know what to do when she got upset", "Nta im autistic and while I do have issues with boundaries like most autistic people. In this situation, just be polite and tell me you need me to be quiet so you can study, which will get me to be quiet.\n\nThe only thing I'd do after that would be asking you politely if you want me to move to another table as well.", "Everyone here gonna say op is the asshole until an autistic person starts fucking with them and do the exact same thing.\n\nNTA.

Next time yell thief.\n\nDetail all the times you would ask her to leave you alone.  You told her you were studying.  That she didn't care that you were staying that she wanted to spend time with you against your consent.\n\nConsent is a big word here.  Use it\n  You asked her nicely to leave You alone.  She would not.  You attempted to leave and she attempted to steal your property.

Anything like that?\n\nCome up with a dollar amount to the amount of stuff she was attempting to steal from you.\n\nBecause if it gets into the you had hands on her hand, well she had hands on your property worth such and such money.

I have a student in the 4th grade, he's only in one of my classes once a week, and everyone else coddles the f*ck out of him. In my first few classes he persisted to insist that I stop my class and give him the floor to say/ask whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, which was every 2 minutes. I made it clear to him that the same rules apply to him as everyone else, that raising your hand does not in itself entitle you to speaking, and that raising your hand and repeatedly squealing/grunting is disruptive behavior which is not allowed in my class and will result in consequences. I also explained to him that there are 19 other students in the group, and they are equally important as him, and the class is just as much about them as it is about him, so he can't take up all of their time by speaking continuously throughout the class. His name has been on the board as a warning, and he has seen other students be written up or their parents called. He gets it now. And this is a 10-year-old autistic boy.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you somebody else's entitlement comes before your boundaries.

Knowing the daughter has trouble communicating, should she assume her side of the story may not be exactly what happened? I would view it as much more fair to reach out to you and see what went on; instead of going through the school to raise potential disciplinary actions, when she wasn\u2019t there.

People with autism often struggle with social cues, and even if you told her you needed to study the one time she might not have applied that to every other situation where she found you and wanted to spend time with you. She very honestly probably didn't pick up on the hints you were trying to send, and was basing her interactions with you on knowing you've been kind to her previously. Of course this doesn't entirely excuse any boundary pushing, especially grabbing you after you made it incredibly clear you didn't want to interact, but that might be a helpful frame of mind to use when approaching this. \n\nIf she is someone you would like to continue to be friends with, make it clear to her, your parents, and the advisor in the meeting but advocate for yourself while you do it. It is ok to need alone time and most people will understand that you need to have some peace and quiet while you study. Be clear and kind with your intentions while enforcing your boundaries, communicate that its not fair to be expected to be available to her around the clock, but that doesn't exclude making purposeful plans in the future.

Arguably, she assaulted you.

It's a genuine miscommunication and something that can definitely be sorted out civilly.", "Yes we do. Society is built on the contract that language and social cues mean something.

I think you wanted to hurt me with that, but I\u2019m amused at the attempt. \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t I simply believe an OP? Because OPs lie on here often enough for it to be a warranted statement. \n\nNo, I\u2019m not one of those people that dives so deep into a post that I read every comment OPs make like it\u2019s a developing news story and I just can\u2019t get enough. When I found out people did that, I was flummoxed. Who has that kind of time?\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re demonstrating quite a bit of ignorance here if you expect an autistic individual to be able to adapt to society. Some can, but most can\u2019t just assimilate. My life and my son\u2019s life would be INFINITELY easier if he could, and believe me if I could snap my fingers and make it happen, I very well might. \n\nWhy did I \u201cbegrudgingly\u201d go NAH? Because yes, I have a bias that literally EVERYONE should learn about autism, and I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s a bias because of my son. Would I report it if I were this girl\u2019s dad?

Going- Hey this person is normally here and then spots them on the floor isn't stalking.", "From this girl's perspective, her friend wasn't where she normally was- that's weird, let's go find her! OP's gentle \"well, I do have a lot of studying to do...\" and things of that sort simply didn't register to her as an attempt to tell her that OP doesn't have time to take to her- of course OP has a lot of studying to do! That's how college goes. What an interesting observation. Nothing short of actually saying \"sorry, but I don't have time to talk to you today\" was going to communicate that. We can't know what would have happened if OP had politely said that to begin with, of course, but there's a good chance it would have worked. It's really unfortunate how things ended up and that they ended up both feeling overwhelmed and scared.", "Prior communication to her was that they were friends and he enjoyed putting aside his non urgent studies to chat with her. \n\nIs that what he meant to communicate to her? No, it's not. But hints equals no communication at all to some autistic people in some circumstances. So it's possible she didn't get any communication from his hints and only from his behavior, which was friendly chatting.\n\nIt's like this. Say I have a friend who is deaf. Due to his disability, he needs me to communicate in specific ways. I can sign, write things down, or make sure I am facing him so he can read my lips. If I talk to him verbally when my back is turned, I can't say I'm communicating with him when I know he isn't getting any of the information I'm communicating. And it wouldn't be his fault at all! Nor could I expect him to respond to what I had communicated. \n\nAutism can be like that. If someone doesn't communicate in a way that the autistic person can process, then it's effectively like no communication is happening. So let's say this was a situation where the person never communicated their discomfort at all. Her behavior wouldn't look like stalking then, would it? \n\nAnd even though OP did communicate his discomfort, he did it in a way her disability caused her to miss. All she had to to on was his behavior, which in a vacuum, directly contradicts how he was feeling and what he was trying to communicate. \n\nShe misunderstood him. That doesn't make either of them a villain here.", "But she did stop talking. OP wanted her gone, but by what she said the girl did adhere to being quiet so she could study. Some people want to be alone and others don't mind as long as its quiet. Sounds like she needed thay distinction vocalized.", "From the post it seems like when op said she didn\u2019t have time to talk the other girl didn\u2019t recognize that as a hint to go away. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the other girl took that to mean she just needed to be quiet but op might have felt that it would be rude to ignore someone who was standing right next to her. I could be wrong but it really does seem like different communication styles that ended up in an unfortunate situation which sucks", "Did you normally stay in your friend's living room after everyone was in bed and not go home?  \n\n\n>if you wake up in the morning and there's still in the living room? Why wouldn't they be? You expect them to leave in the middle of the night?\n\nUmmm, yeah, he was in his 30s and his house was 15 minutes away. What do you think was going on? Did you think we were just tossing him onto the street with no car in the middle of the night, and just said, figure it out?", "I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s acceptable, I\u2019m talking about what might have worked for OP to get what she wanted. Hints don\u2019t work. Being direct results in a meltdown and an \u201cincident\u201d. \u201cBe direct\u201d isn\u2019t enough advice when you are telling someone something they don\u2019t want to hear", "I was saying that she probably FELT violated, not that I objectively violated her. I\u2019m definitely not going to be pushed over in the meeting and I\u2019ll have my dad there to support me because I already told him what happened. I WANT to assume that her and her mom are nice reasonable people", "both of them are 18", "She was assaulted first and deescalated and removed herself from the situation. Is she supposed to just stay when she got grabbed onto?", "Where was the assault? OP just removed her hand from her bag after she grabbed it to keep it there. That could also be seen as assault, she was removing herself from a situation that scared her.", "I look at grabbing her arm as being pretty equivalent to the autistic girl grabbing the bag. Like, I know there are times I've reacted to a distressing and confusing situation by trying to physically slow down or stop what was happening in front of me so I could process it better. But I've had to learn not to do that with people because yeah, that's not really allowed. \n\nSo I can sympathize with the girl who grabbed the bag while also understanding that it's ok for someone to respond to being grabbed in kind, you know? \n\nStill, I think this escalated due to poor communication and really, nobody should get in any kind of trouble here because I don't think either OP or the girl had any malicious intent. I do share your exhaustion with passive aggressive pricks though. \n\nWhy is it that those of us with the disability are always making accommodations for the non disabled people around us? I have learned to speak their language, why can't they learn to communicate with me in mine?", "Whoa!  I am also autistic and I would in no way consider the OP a \"passive-aggressive prick\" or the interaction an assault by either party. Your interpretation is way out in left field.", "It's ignorant because you don't understand autism. The girl simply didn't understand. Nobody is the asshole here. Hints aren't clear to autistic people, and being told that they needed to study but continuing to talk is also unclear. Though nobody should've grabbed anyone, that's clear. And someone who doesn't know how to interact with autistic people simply wouldn't know these things. To the girl, OP seemingly reacted very negatively out of nowhere and that's very jarring. And to OP, the girl was seeming to cross boundaries he thought she thought were maybe obvious.", "If he was legitimately accused of assault this would escalate beyond just a meeting with a CA. They might just want to clear up miscommunications and create new protocols going forward. CAs are mostly for resolving conflict, not investigating crimes.", "She talked to her even when she didn\u2019t want to, then avoided her until she couldn\u2019t anymore, then ripped off her headphones and said \u201cleave me the fuck alone\u201d basically. OP has been very immature and caused this situation. She needs to learn to communicate.", "She was physically prevented from leaving the situation, god forbid she reacts and yells.\n\nIt is on the autistic woman to learn that you do not physically prevent someone from leaving if they wish to go away from you.", "Why would I want to hurt you?  I used strong language to try get you to *listen*.  If you've landed on amused I can see that didn't work.   And if you'd landed on hurt I'd apologise and rephrase to see if you could hear alternate views. \n\nI read whatever comments already exist on a post simply to see the entire picture presented before I decide if I can add to the picture.   If you don't.... goodo.... rush in with your armour on and your gun half cocked.   \n\nWe all have our burdens.  We all have to live as best we can with that and within our abilities and with as much courage as can be mustered.  Our closest and dearest will choose to 'educate' themselves as they want the best for us.  Everyone else?   They are simply trying to carry their own burdens.  You admit bias as if it's a strength.   What makes autism more important than PTSD,  CSA, disability,  grief, ageing.... literally everything?  It's important to you and yours and you can rage against the machine all you like but.... again.... everyone else can't hear you. \n\nAs to your last sentence.... I agree you can't know what you may report and it's fair to have bias for your child.   On the face of it... I'd hope you'd see your child missteped in laying hands first, and someone else's child would understandably both lack experience in an appropriate response and deserves the right to remove a hand on their arm.   It seems it would be better for the adult both kids will become if you heard OPs side before a report.... but hey... not everyone can bring a sense of natural justice or fairness I guess.  Pity tho.... you could've nurtured a friendship there instead of throwing more barriers and excuses.", "I think grabbing her seems like what triggered it, but that\u2019s also not OPs fault because the friend laid hands on her first.", "She was blunt and clear after it reached an escalation from her POV. \n\nWhich because she was clearly upset and angry at that point made the autistic person feel attached. It's not OP's fault due to lack of knowledge.\n\nClear language always works better with autistics -- more specifics the better.", "OP wasn\u2019t clear to begin with. Which wasn\u2019t her fault, that type of interaction isn\u2019t normal for her.

There is nothing they could've done differently.", "OP straight up communicated that they needed to study and couldn't chat. What could be clearer than that?", "I\u2019m not talking about the first time, I\u2019m talking about the altercation where the girl grabbed OP\u2019s backpack and had a meltdown", "The first several times. But at the time of the physical incident, OP was totally clear, and it seems the girl understood her because she responded with \u201cI want to spend time with you.\u201d OP tried to leave and the girl tried to physically prevent her.", "I think they thought you all lived together", "OP, if she felt violated or that\u2019s what she told her mother then you are going into a meeting being accused of assault. That is literally a crime. I am all for looking for the good in people but this is not the time for that.

If tone is so impossible to read then why would that be so upsetting?", "OP admits she escalated by using a rude tone of voice. Understandable, but not indicative of what a calm conversation would have resulted in.", "But not being able to chat doesn't mean that she needed to leave.

I have also seen op say that the other girl was smiling and potentially just tying to mess around like you do with friends when she grabbed her bag.
