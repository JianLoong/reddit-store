I am out and have been out since age 14 my boyfriend is or was closeted before this incident. I am not outwardly flamboyant but I can be at times while my boyfriend is very \u201cmasculine\u201d and is very good at passing. He is the stereotypical all American boy ex. Football, student council, straight a\u2019s, etc. we live in a more mixed area so views on social issues vary from household to household. My family is more middle ground while his is very staunchly traditional. \n\nAfter dating for a few months I started going over to his house to just hang out and enjoy each other\u2019s company. We don\u2019t do anything other than just talk or watch Netflix really. I was on very good terms with his parents as they supported the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d we had. One night I slept over and I woke to my boyfriend\u2019s mother gasping and slamming the door. My boyfriend and I had fallen asleep in each other\u2019s arms and his mother walked in on this. We frantically got dressed and I was advised by my boyfriend to leave quickly. As I was rushing out my boyfriend\u2019s father intercepted me and yelled at me questioning where I was going. I froze and he led me into the dining room where his mother was there crying. My boyfriend\u2019s father yelled for him to come down and join us. He then proceeded to yell at us that what we were doing was disgusting and that I \u201ccorrupted\u201d their pure child. My boyfriend and I explained that nothing happened and we just fell asleep like that. They weren\u2019t having it and screamed at me to leave their home. I quickly grabbed my stuff and headed out looking back at my mortified boyfriend. I Ubered home and texted him immediately to see if he was okay and I didn\u2019t get a response. My parents got a call from his parents basically calling me a disease ridden monster that ruined their perfect son who is now saying we\u2019re dating. My parents hung up on them after a bit of their ranting and informed me of the call. Now my boyfriend\u2019s family is going online posting that my family raised a \u201cgroomer\u201d my families jobs are at stake and some of my scholarships are as well. \n\nI asked some of my friends and they told me that I shouldn\u2019t even stayed the night there in the first place.

In this instance, without a shadow of a doubt, you are the victim here. What a terrible waste of your time and energy. I wish you speedy healing.\n\n1) You can't turn someone gay. Periodt. Not possible. Sexuality exists on a spectrum. The Internet is full of positive resources for you about all the wonderful ways people experience their own sexuality. \"Turning someone gay\" is homophobic language.\n\n2) It's not your fault that his parents are ill informed hateful people. It would have been nice if he had let you know that about them before inviting you to stay the night.\n\n3) Whatever these A-holes are doing on social media is malicious and dangerous. You are a minor child. All of this hate-speech could have real world consequences.  They are invading your privacy and putting you in jeopardy. Your parents need to get a restraining order against them. They can also sue them for damages if you have lost scholarships.\n4)  Fight back. Don't let them win. You are gay. It's perfectly normal. You are special and brave to be out so young. Congratulations. It's beautiful you have a loving supportive family. What should be normal is a life filled with happiness, community and connection...  and parents who love their children unconditionally", "NTA, and this isn't your fault in any way. I'm glad your boyfriend is 18 and almost full legal age and hopefully can get out of that toxic environment. I would talk to your parents about how you're feeling with guilt and worry about everything. It could be that isn't the place for any of you, and this was the situation that showed to you, your family, and your boyfriend.\n\nI wish you all luck and \u2764\ufe0f.", "NTA at all.

But it is not your fault.", "NTA. Complain about the posts and have them removed. I wonder if you could report them for harrassment.", "It's absolutely ridiculous that this is still a thing in 2023. No you're not the asshole, your boyfriend's parents are. I couldn't imagine not supporting my children completely in anything they did. That reaction is disgusting and I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. Keep being you and hopefully your boyfriend will start being more himself now too. Good luck and I hope this situation ends with happiness.", "NTA.\n\nAnd kudos to your boyfriend for telling his parents y'all were dating.  That took some guts.", "You know very well you didn't make him gay and that you're NTA. His parents sound like vile people and I'm sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA.\n\nFairly sure thats not how sexual prefferences work. It's not like a gay person swishes their booty in a straight mans face and enchants them. That just means the guy liked other mens butts.\n\nAnd it's certainly not a disease or contagion. It's simply nature.\n\nAlso, calling you a groomer is wildly inappropriate and slanderous. There is no age gap between you nor do you have a position of power such as a parent, guardian or teacher. I'm sure by what ever logic they use that any romance could be described as grooming; \"a 14 year old boy sending a 14 year old girl a valentines card, gee golly gosh\".\n\n> Now my boyfriend\u2019s family is going online posting that my family raised a \u201cgroomer\u201d my families jobs are at stake and some of my scholarships are as well. \n\nMight be worth your family speaking to a lawyer.

So your parents could lose their job bc they have a gay son? \n\nI\u2019m sorry but you sound either dramatic or you\u2019re making shit up.

You're stuck in a position where you have to manage how you act and what you do because there's (often scary) repercussions for being who you are. Homophobia is real and often its ugly behavior is accepted in some communities. I'm glad you have your parents and friends and their support. As for their postings, I would perhaps consider posting nothing that addresses them but talk about how much you love and care for your boyfriend and that he has to fight incredible odds just to be with you and that you are grateful he thinks you're worth it, etc. Basically, you can counter the idea of 'groomer' (for real? You're 17 and in a relationship. Please.) anyhow, you can counter the idea by demonstrating that it's romance and by choosing your words carefully, you allow them to show that they are homophobic and you are  a perfectly normal teenager in love.
