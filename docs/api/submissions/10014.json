You also wrongly assumed that other parents have the same ideals as you and would offer to help. Now you\u2019re upset that no one has.", "YTA\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only parent with a sitter and her husband works.  She has the time\u201d\n\nWtf?  You just know all the parents\u2019 schedules, workloads, and availability?  She mentioned to you that she was looking forward to having a free weekend (something that all parents look forward to), and you decided to punish her *and* her kid for that?\n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but your own that none of the parents offered to help at the pier - you expected them to \u201cjust offer to help\u201d!   You didn\u2019t ask for help, you didn\u2019t tell the parents that the trip to the pier was dependent on other parents signing up to help chaperone.  You expected them to read your mind and know that you wanted them to offer to help you.", "YTA.  It's not other parents' job to offer to help with your kid's birthday, and it's not their job to read your mind either.  If you needed help, you should've asked, rather than forcing a mom to help by threatening to disinvite a literal child.  Or, you could've thought ahead and interviewed for new sitters to help with this.  Either way, this is entirely on you.\n\nAlso, I worked as a camp counselor in my early twenties and was regularly in charge (by myself) of anywhere between 5 and 12 8-year-olds on outings to Disneyland and Universal Studios, as well as other spots all over L.A.  It really wasn't that hard as long as I really firmly laid out ground rules surrounding safety with the kids and made sure that they understood the fun would be over if they broke the rules.", "YTA. \n\nIf you want help or need back-up you need to specify on the invitations \"parental attendance is required\" or something like that. Also, singling out this parent because the mom has a sitter and has \"the time\" (who are you to judge that) is an AH move. If you can't handle the number of people you invited that is on you and you should cancel the pier trip all together and just have the slumber party.", "YTA and no it is absolutely NOT customary for random parents to volunteer to babysit kids at your child\u2019s birthday party. And the fact that you\u2019re basically threatening her by un-inviting her kid if she doesn\u2019t help\u2026oh my GAWD you\u2019re such an asshole and if you keep up with this type of bat poo crazy behavior your kid will have zero friends.", "YTA\n\nI have adult kids.  In all the years that I had birthday parties for them as children, no parent of an invited child ever offered to help out, nor did I ever offer to help out at a birthday party to which my kids were invited.  So unless there are very different customs where you live, your expectations are unrealistic, and singling out one mom because she expressed that she was looking forward to a kid-free weekend is just perverse.\n\nIn future, if you don't have adequate help and support for a particular kind of birthday party, plan a different kind of party that you can manage.  If you're particularly close to the parents of one of your child's friends, you could conceivably ask them if they'd mind helping, but you must do this before you start inviting kids.  And you must know that they may well consider your request an imposition.", "YTA - If YOU can't handle the kids YOU needed to ask for help like an adult instead of assuming youre entitled to others time. Learn to communicate. And it's not fair to ask you 17 year old to babysity, and it's not fair to change your son's birthday plans because you don't know how to properly plan a safe party. Also you have no idea what is going on in her life and if she has the time and you don't get to demand it. Hire some help if you don't have any friends of your own that want to be around you and the kids long enough to help you in a bind (that you created all on your own)", "YTA for arranging a party and just assuming that other parents would stay. They're at the age where drop-off parties are normal now. It's fair enough to need help wrangling a group of high-energy 8 year olds in a public space, but you need to arrange that beforehand.\n\n\"Hey, mom friend, I'm trying to put together a party for Son, but I'll need another couple of parents to help corral the boys. Would you be free on X day?\"", ">Anyways this mom is pretty mad at me for singling her out.\n\nYTA. I don't blame her. The \"sitter\" comment took the cake.\n\nIt wouldn't have hit as hard if you had *started* with her and worked your way down the list of other mothers to ask them, basically to ask for assistance rather than demand it.", "YTA. Organise a kids party you can manage. Ffs.", "YTA - \"Anyways this mom is pretty mad at me for singling her out\" well that's because you have. It's all well and good saying you need help for a group but treating her alone this way is major AH Territory", "YTA. Why did you invite kids somewhere if you\u2019re incapable of watching them?", "YTA. What started as an invitation to her son turned into an obligation to help run your party. This is extremely unfair and while they could back out of the party who wants to do that to their kid?\n\nThe imaginary sleight is just that - all in your head, and you\u2019re using it to convince yourself that your rude behavior is justified. She was saying she is thankful!?\n\nYou could have just communicated with ALL of the families that you need help to make it work and ask if anyone is interested to join at the pier. You probably would have had multiple parents volunteer. YTA", "YTA! How did you not think this through before you invited the kids?????? This is all on you. Recruit a friend or family member, beg your friends, or hire someone as a sitter to come with you. Or write a very sweet note to all the parents saying you\u2019ve realized you bit off more than you can chew and is anyone available to come with and help manage the kids (at your expense of course).", "YTA. It's on you to make all the arrangements, including getting a sitter or asking the other parents to help chaperone if you can't handle it alone. You don't get to just volunteer them to help out because you goofed.", "Yta. Your ego and baby sitting skills writing cheques your body can't cash. Why invite so many kids, or that destination? Invite what you can manage", "YTA. Don't throw parties you can't handle. Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency for her.", "YTA for assuming she had the time. You know... you could hire someone to help!", "YTA\n\nI fail to see how your problem with containing them is anyone else's problem? \n\nYou decided to go have a beach party for your son, you then decided to invite everyone without asking for help.. And now your mad that no one stood up to help? It's not their party. It's yours. \n\nDon't plan shit you can't handle.. And don't be entitled to the point where you believe every other parent needs to drop shit to make time to help you. You DIDN'T ask them.", "YTA. You jumped straight to an ultimatum before asking a single person for help.", "YTA - First, why do you think you get to decide what someone else has time to do? You do not know everything going on in this woman\u2019s life. Second, your poor planning is not her problem. Third, it is disgusting to invite someone to something and then threaten to uninvite them if they don\u2019t do what you want. Multiply the AH factor of this behavior by 100 when it involves a child. If you need help, grow up and ask for it. People can\u2019t read your mind and operating on what you think people \u201cshould\u201d offer to do is a losing game.", "YTA- You could have asked for volunteers on the invite instead of sulking that people didn\u2019t read your mind.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to admit you need help with supervising the children. It is wrong to single out one parent and demand they help supervise or their child will be disinvited. You should have realised at the planning stage that this would be a problem. You should have asked all the parents if anyone would help when you were planning. That would have been the fair way to go about it.", "YTA. If you couldn't manage them alone, you shouldn't have organised it. And you shouldn't have just assumed that others were going to offer to help.", "YTA. Repeat after me, You are not entitled to other people's time. Just because you choose help out doesn't mean they have to help you out too. Maybe don't host a party if you can't handle the kids.", "YTA this seems like a lack of you organismling problem", "YTA\n\nThis is just not how you go about it, if you can't take it then don't do it, if you need help ask for it and beforehand.", "YTA. You know why by now from the other comments.", "YTA\n\nPicking on one mother is wrong.\n\nOpen it up, tell all of the mothers that you need at least 1 adult for every 2-3 children in a location as open and volatile as the pier.   \n\nOtherwise you change your plan and the party stays at your home and there's no group trip to the pier.", "YTA \n\n\nYou don\u2019t know her schedule or her plans or obligations.

If you need help to pull off an event, you ask for volunteers before finalizing the activity and inviting guests. Clear communication and planning are what's really customary when you're putting together an event. \n\nThis parent has every right to feel singled out. Unfortunately, if you had asked for her help beforehand, she may have helped willingly. This is because the meaning behind the request is different.

On the other hand, she's a bit of an ass for not reciprocating help (not that it's score for score, but seems customary in your circles), as well as mentioning the situation as \"babysitting\" her son.
