Your wife and child are not cupcakes being handed out at a birthday party. I would strongly encourage your wife to only share that she is in labor with people whose feedback or presence is going to be helpful for her.  She can tell her parents the baby has been born when she feels ready to deal with their nonsense. If they get mad and throw a fit, fine, more proof that they aren\u2019t mature enough to be part of this life event. They can continue to not be around!", "As the husband and father, it will be your duty to advocate for your wife's wishes when she is in the vulnerable state of giving birth. That's with the nurses and family.\n\nI've had to tell family to back off and nurses to provide certain treatments as per my wife's wishes because she is in too much pain/anxiety to properly voice it herself. Make sure it is her wishes and don't bother bringing up stuff like \"you had your chance\". Just be to the point and respectful about it, \"my wife wants to this to be a private event.\" Don't bother telling anyone else who can or can't be there just tell the people that can be that they aee invited and those that aren't that they aren't.", "NTA, but you could be. You clearly have anger towards your wife's parents and it sounds like its justified. But also sounds like your wife has worked on her healing and now wants to try and have a relationship with her parents. The best thing you can do is just lay out ahead of time as kindly as possible how things will be. I would suggest maybe writing something to send to her parents and anyone else you're close with that you want to know you post birth boundaries.\n\nSomething like... were overjoyed if you want to be at the hospital for the birth, but only XYZ will be allowed in the delivery room. We've decided to have (your) Mom be the only one to stay with us/visit/whatever that boundary is for the first ABC time period after birth. We know that many of you want to be a part of these moments, and we love that you do! We hope you can understand and respect that we've made these choices as we feel it will be whats best for our family. We can't wait for you to get to know (baby).", "Just don\u2019t tell them. Don\u2019t post on social media. Don\u2019t call them. Don\u2019t tell them until you\u2019re both ready for them to visit at the hospital. If they get snippy afterwards, either tell them the truth or say everything was just so crazy, you didn\u2019t have time.", "NTA, it is her wishes for that, and since she isn't comfortable with communicating that herself you have the right to do it for her", "NTA. Neither is your wife. She is giving birth but it is an experience for you too, and it is one of the greatest bonding events in a marriage. So, nobody in the delivery but you and your wife. Your mom can be there immediately after.", "NTA. Please read this and repeat out loud and repeat whenever needed:  CHILDBIRTH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT. \nExcuse me. I'm a granny. I feel much better now.  \nYou do NOT have to give anyone , especially wife's parents, detailed information. You can be vague about a due date (tell them a date later than real due date). You do not have to let them know when your wife is in labor. It's ok to call after the baby is born. (It went so quickly we just didn't have time to call anyone). \nDon't post anything on social media until after you are safely home. Tell nurses in the  hospital that your mother is only one you want visiting while your wife is in labor. \nCongrats on the baby!", "You.... don't have to tell them when she goes into labor or has the baby. You can bar them from the delivery room. You don't have to open your front door.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it would be best to talk with your wife, brainstorm possible scenarios, and get specific instructions from her. Especially when it comes to her mother being present at the birth. Follow your wife's instructions to the letter, do not back down, and stay on your wife's side without fail and without compromise.", "You can set up a birth plan with the hospital.  Among other things you can specify who is in the room or who is allowed in the room when.", "NTA but the best way would be if your wife clearly articulates what she wants and at least sends a message to her parents so it is clear that this coming from her, not you; then you will be in the clear to enforce her preferences, again, clearing with your wife what she would like you to do in regard to her parents.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is the appearance of you deciding for your wife and getting in the way of her and her parents, and this will be exacerbated if you wife won't say what she wants. There's no getting around that there will most likely be a negative reaction from her parents, but part of building a healthy relationship with them is them learning to respect healthy boundaries with your wife -- so the boundaries need to be known to come from her.\n\nUnfortunately, if your wife is wishy-washy here, wanting to be nice or to avoid conflict, she will be getting in her own way as avoiding setting desired boundaries is not going to lead to any sort of healthy relationship.", "NTA. \n\nThis is your role as father to protect your wife while she is birthing your child. You need to have many discussions with your wife about what she wants from her birthing experience. Ask her what her best case scenario is in terms of timeline for visitors, who will be present and who will be invited to visit after the birth. \n\nReiterate with her she is allowed to decide these things without worrying about people getting offended. Consider therapy if your wife has not had it before, especially because a traumatic childhood and come back to you when you become a parent yourself. Make sure you are both on the same page before you inform any of the parents the plans. When you inform the parents you state \"WE have decided...\" \"This is OUR plan for the birth\". Language is important here. You are a united team and there is no discussion to be had. Any questions are to be directed to you, not your wife. If they get upset or offended, inform the hospital they are not to be admitted.", "It bears mentioning that what your wife thinks she wants now may shift after baby arrives. Be open to supporting her however you can. If she decides she does or does not want certain people around after baby comes, you can protect your wife and be the bad guy.", "You are the man. (Written as a compliment)Great decision.  They don\u2019t have to agree, or accept, they just have to deal with it. \n\nGood job bro.", "This is so key to internalize - *it\u2019s not about being fair*. And as others have said, OP, though your intentions are good, please also take care to not become another person your wife has to manage when it comes to how she interacts with her parents during this pregnancy. \n\nThe pregnant person\u2019s needs take priority during medical pregnancy / delivery care. Then **the child(ren)\u2019s needs take priority** (throughout childhood) followed by the child(ren)\u2019s guardians\u2019 needs. Somewhere much further along down the list are other people\u2019s wants.", "Exactly all of this.  This isn't the time for OP to lash out about 'you had your chance'.  That causes an issue where it sounds like the wife has tried to put it behind her.  \n\nJust explain that your wife wants her space during the birth, they'e more than welcome to be at the hospital but not in the room.  That's it.  If she has just recently 'forgiven' them and started to mend fences, they should not be surprised they won't be in the delivery room.  It's not a movie theater :)", "I think you hit the nail on the head, I am working on forgiving them for the things they put her through. She's a much better person than I am that's for sure. Thank you for that.", "I'm glad that helped. Its funny how sometimes its much easier to let go of hurt and anger when its us being hurt than when its someone we love. You're definitely not a bad person for not being ready to let go yet. That just goes to show how much you love your wife and care when she's hurt."]}
