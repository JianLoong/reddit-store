Your wife and child are not cupcakes being handed out at a birthday party. I would strongly encourage your wife to only share that she is in labor with people whose feedback or presence is going to be helpful for her.  She can tell her parents the baby has been born when she feels ready to deal with their nonsense. If they get mad and throw a fit, fine, more proof that they aren\u2019t mature enough to be part of this life event. They can continue to not be around!", "As the husband and father, it will be your duty to advocate for your wife's wishes when she is in the vulnerable state of giving birth. That's with the nurses and family.\n\nI've had to tell family to back off and nurses to provide certain treatments as per my wife's wishes because she is in too much pain/anxiety to properly voice it herself. Make sure it is her wishes and don't bother bringing up stuff like \"you had your chance\". Just be to the point and respectful about it, \"my wife wants to this to be a private event.\" Don't bother telling anyone else who can or can't be there just tell the people that can be that they aee invited and those that aren't that they aren't.", "NTA, but you could be. You clearly have anger towards your wife's parents and it sounds like its justified. But also sounds like your wife has worked on her healing and now wants to try and have a relationship with her parents. The best thing you can do is just lay out ahead of time as kindly as possible how things will be. I would suggest maybe writing something to send to her parents and anyone else you're close with that you want to know you post birth boundaries.\n\nSomething like... were overjoyed if you want to be at the hospital for the birth, but only XYZ will be allowed in the delivery room. We've decided to have (your) Mom be the only one to stay with us/visit/whatever that boundary is for the first ABC time period after birth. We know that many of you want to be a part of these moments, and we love that you do!

I feel much better now.  \nYou do NOT have to give anyone , especially wife's parents, detailed information. You can be vague about a due date (tell them a date later than real due date). You do not have to let them know when your wife is in labor. It's ok to call after the baby is born.

Tell nurses in the  hospital that your mother is only one you want visiting while your wife is in labor. \nCongrats on the baby!", "You.... don't have to tell them when she goes into labor or has the baby.

But it would be best to talk with your wife, brainstorm possible scenarios, and get specific instructions from her. Especially when it comes to her mother being present at the birth. Follow your wife's instructions to the letter, do not back down, and stay on your wife's side without fail and without compromise.", "You can set up a birth plan with the hospital.  Among other things you can specify who is in the room or who is allowed in the room when.", "NTA but the best way would be if your wife clearly articulates what she wants and at least sends a message to her parents so it is clear that this coming from her, not you; then you will be in the clear to enforce her preferences, again, clearing with your wife what she would like you to do in regard to her parents.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is the appearance of you deciding for your wife and getting in the way of her and her parents, and this will be exacerbated if you wife won't say what she wants. There's no getting around that there will most likely be a negative reaction from her parents, but part of building a healthy relationship with them is them learning to respect healthy boundaries with your wife -- so the boundaries need to be known to come from her.\n\nUnfortunately, if your wife is wishy-washy here, wanting to be nice or to avoid conflict, she will be getting in her own way as avoiding setting desired boundaries is not going to lead to any sort of healthy relationship.", "NTA. \n\nThis is your role as father to protect your wife while she is birthing your child. You need to have many discussions with your wife about what she wants from her birthing experience. Ask her what her best case scenario is in terms of timeline for visitors, who will be present and who will be invited to visit after the birth. \n\nReiterate with her she is allowed to decide these things without worrying about people getting offended. Consider therapy if your wife has not had it before, especially because a traumatic childhood and come back to you when you become a parent yourself. Make sure you are both on the same page before you inform any of the parents the plans. When you inform the parents you state \"WE have decided...\" \"This is OUR plan for the birth\". Language is important here. You are a united team and there is no discussion to be had. Any questions are to be directed to you, not your wife. If they get upset or offended, inform the hospital they are not to be admitted.", "It bears mentioning that what your wife thinks she wants now may shift after baby arrives. Be open to supporting her however you can. If she decides she does or does not want certain people around after baby comes, you can protect your wife and be the bad guy.", "You are the man. (Written as a compliment)Great decision.  They don\u2019t have to agree, or accept, they just have to deal with it. \n\nGood job bro.", "This is so key to internalize - *it\u2019s not about being fair*. And as others have said, OP, though your intentions are good, please also take care to not become another person your wife has to manage when it comes to how she interacts with her parents during this pregnancy. \n\nThe pregnant person\u2019s needs take priority during medical pregnancy / delivery care. Then **the child(ren)\u2019s needs take priority** (throughout childhood) followed by the child(ren)\u2019s guardians\u2019 needs. Somewhere much further along down the list are other people\u2019s wants.", "Exactly all of this.  This isn't the time for OP to lash out about 'you had your chance'.  That causes an issue where it sounds like the wife has tried to put it behind her.  \n\nJust explain that your wife wants her space during the birth, they'e more than welcome to be at the hospital but not in the room.  That's it.  If she has just recently 'forgiven' them and started to mend fences, they should not be surprised they won't be in the delivery room.  It's not a movie theater :)", "I think you hit the nail on the head, I am working on forgiving them for the things they put her through. She's a much better person than I am that's for sure. Thank you for that.", "I'm glad that helped. Its funny how sometimes its much easier to let go of hurt and anger when its us being hurt than when its someone we love. You're definitely not a bad person for not being ready to let go yet. That just goes to show how much you love your wife and care when she's hurt.", "NTA. \n\nDo not tell them when she is in labor. Don\u2019t mention that your mother is helping- they don\u2019t need to know this. People always over share when they really don\u2019t need to state more than necessary! Keep it respectful, keep the information to a minimum. \n\nYou tell them that they can visit on X day(whenever that is after the birth) and that you\u2019re looking forward to their visit. \n\nAnd do not let them run you both over because they are \u201cexcited\u201d. You must be sure to protect your family, and then means making sure some people don\u2019t overwhelm you. Good luck.", "NTA, but you\u2019ll need to be very careful about how you communicate this if you don\u2019t want to be one. In this situation, it\u2019s probably best not to mention that she doesn\u2019t want them there because they missed their chance to be good parents. That will only cause more conflict, which it sounds like your wife is trying to avoid. And like many people here have said, it\u2019s not about what\u2019s fair. It\u2019s about what you and your wife want. If you both agree on what you want, then that\u2019s all that matters. Communicate her wishes with her parents in a mature and respectful manner (and in a way that doesn\u2019t blame and attack them), and when they create drama over it, they will look like the assholes.", "NTA - your wife needs to stand up now.  \nWhat will happen after the baby is born and they won\u2019t take no for an answer for what they want to do ?  \nAll of this too nice, people pleaser, non confrontational is bullshit.  \nTell your wife to grow a spine.  \nShe\u2019s a mother first now not a daughter.", "Do not call them until after the baby arrives.   Let the visit while everyone is in the hospital, number of people limited and arguments should be kept to a minimum.  My advice to all new parents, including my own children, is when you get baby home, lock the doors for two weeks.  Don\u2019t let anyone in.  This gives parents and new baby a chance to meet each other and try to figure out what the heck to do next.   It isn\u2019t \u201cmean\u201d or \u201crude\u201d or any other stupid word.   This also helps keep germs and sick people away.    IF you and wife choose, you can allow anyone you want into your home, and you can limit how long/often they visit. \n\nKeep in mind too that visitors in your home should be doing helpful things.   If aunt A comes in and immediately starts laundry, cleaning, meal prep, etc she is a keeper.   If grandma R comes in, plops her behind down and does nothing, but complain or expected to be waited on then she can stay away until you are ready for guests.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't tell them when you are going to the hospital, tell them when the kid is already there.", "It\u2019s not about fairness. It\u2019s about what mom and baby needs. Wife is going to be very vulnerable during this time. Speak up for your child. Wife needs to find her shiny spine and speak up too. She may actually need some therapy to help her learn to effectively communicate her boundaries to her parents. Until then you may have to be the \u201cvillain\u201d and set the boundaries. This will only work if she had your back 100%. Talk to her about what she wants/needs and stick to that. You sound like a good and decent partner. Check out r/justnomil if you haven\u2019t yet. They have lots of practical advice on how to deal with difficult parents. Things like putting the hospital staff on notice for no visitors, turning off your cell phones until after the birth, waiting until you\u2019ve made your own social media announcement of the birth to tell parents the info because they\u2019ll try and steal that moment from you. If you think they\u2019re pushy now, babies tend to make them so much worse. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is not a who gets the biggest piece of pie \u2018fair\u2019 event. This is the birth of a tiny human. This tiny human will rely entirely on you & your wife, almost exclusively, to make decisions that keep it safe and loved and well looked after. Start by putting in place your boundaries now regarding the birth of your baby. If you do not want people there, whomever they are, tell them. If they get upset too bad. Do not tell anyone, except who you want present, when your wife has gone into labor. Do not announce the birth until you all have had a chance to rest.", "You are fair in games of tag, not when it comes to the stability and well being of human life. Childbirth can turn bad fast. I died on the operating table (they brought me back but it took bags of blood for me to walk out of the hospital a week later). \n\nBe safe. I blame the spectators for the turn my first delivery made and had a planned c section with only dad, aunt, and grandpa a room over and not bothering me for the second.

It's completely fair that shitty humans don't get the same privileges as good ones.", "Exactly this. Don't inform anyone your wife is in labour - announce the birth afterwards. This is your experience as a new family, not theirs.", "Have your wife read this. It may help her understand why setting these boundaries now is so important. \n\nThe Lemon Clot Essay\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/s/GMpN1WPKaT", "I was honest with my husband that the period when I give birth/the first few weeks postpartum would be one of the only times in our marriage where I did not give a fuck about \"fairness\" and what I wanted came first. Birth is inherently unfair because only one partner is *giving birth* and then recovering from that. If my decision to XYZ upsets your family, then they'll need to manage that on their own."]}
