He offered alcohol to 9the5s but withheld from you because of your husband's disapproval.", "\"...apparently what I said really hurt him since he considers me a daughter.\"\n\nSo, you're willing to cause that hurt to that man over a fucking cocktail? And you refuse to apologize for it?\n\nYou are so the AH.", "I'm going to vote **NTA**, but that's only because you clarified the incident. Without it, it seems fishy, but with it given, your in-laws have big problems to resolve, especially since they seem to be blaming you for someone else's despicable actions.\n\nHowever, the way your basic post reads make you look like the asshole because that incident is a lot of missing context.", "Her husband said she was drugged and being followed by a guy at a party. Personally, I think she\u2019s NTA and husband is victim blaming. I think he thinks she shouldn\u2019t drink again because she could be SA\u2019d and he would consider it cheating. I\u2019ve known a number of men with that exact train of thought", "This is what I was thinking as well. Like OP had been drinking and flirting with another guy, which turned into him \"following her around.\" It's not her fault she was drugged. But there's something missing here.", "That's the face value of it. But the subtext of the post is drinking problem and possibly outbursts when drunk.", "NTA then, they're victim-blaming.", "You know maybe people don\u2019t want to relive an SA experience", "Yeah, I\u2019m super curious how much OP drinks currently, and how messy they get when they do drink. Having worked as a bouncer, people get micked in an instant\u2026. The most popular targets though are people that are already a few sheets to the wind\u2026 and with OPs husband being there and close enough to watch, I\u2019m not buying it. Based on some of the defensiveness in op\u2019s comments, and vagueness in the post, I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a whole lot more of an issue we aren\u2019t being told.", "You're right, it doesn't make sense.\n\nDo you live in some kind of parallel universe where everyone's behavior is logical and rational?\n\nIt is absolutely equal possible that what OP is saying doesn't make sense because her partner is behaving in a nonsensical manner."]}
