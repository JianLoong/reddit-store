Son has been charged with minor in possession of marijuana for personal use and the juvenile court system ordered random drug testing,counseling and probation for 6 months.

Have you looked at the psychological impact of this kind of thing on people in prison? It's pretty terrible. It's kind of like you've decided that, since your kid isn't going to jail, you'll psychologically abuse him just like that at home. And, to be clear, one reason we don't want our kids in prison is that prison is institutionalized abuse with lifelong consequences.\n\nI would not blink at him being grounded for a stretch, or suddenly subject to a ton more parental supervision. Chores are fine, even bunches of them. But \"outside of school he does not see or talk to friends and very limited family.\" Six months of this is a recipe for horrifying depression. \n\n\"He does not have a choice on what he wears, eats or does.\" Do NOT get into those power struggles with a teenager. He's going to feel like he has nothing to lose and he will go right ahead and hurt himself to take back some control.\n\nI also must question your ability to keep this up for six months. This is going to be exhausting and unpleasant for your entire family. I would rather impose milder consequences that I can hold everyone to than draconian ones I will fall off of when I get tired.\n\nYou say this kid has never been in trouble before, so now seems like a time to find out what the hell happened. A jump from \"sometimes you don't clean your room\" to \"selling thc products at school\" is a big jump. What's going on? How do you plan to find out?", "Ah yes, simulating prison, a place famous for its rehabilitative effects. YTA", "YTA.\n\nSome of the things you are doing are fine -- for example, grounding your son from using electronics for fun is reasonable enough. (Though I think six months is too harsh.)\n\nWhere you lost me is not allowing your son to choose what he wears or eats. These are key facets of being an individual. There is no way in which being forced to wear a certain outfit or eat certain food is going to help your son understand any risks associated with marijuana. But it will make him resent you for a long time.\n\nYou say you're simulating a prison environment, but I'll add that the notion of sending people to prison to low-level marijuana possession is ridiculous. While it's good to have consequences, and some loss of privileges is reasonable, I would encourage you to focus more on addressing the root concerns (e.g., the effects of marijuana on the developing brain) than going on a power trip as wannabe prison wardens.", "My parents did this when I was 15 and I (28 now) still deal with the long-lasting trauma. I was in solitary confinement with no stimulation for 10-16 hours per day. My parents withheld all affection and barely communicated with me. It was summer break at the time so I never saw any friends or communicated with anyone outside of the home. The teenage brain CANNOT cope with this. All it taught me was that if I fall out of line, everyone will turn their back on me and that my parents love was not unconditional. It was pure torture and part of me STILL resents them for doing that to me. \n\nA year after my \u201cprobation\u201d AT 16 I was diagnosed with PTSD and developed something called trichotillomania. Shortly after my diagnosis, I started smoking pot regularly and binge drinking almost every weekend. My parents never had a clue because they were so sure I had learned my lesson about substance abuse. In reality, all they did was break down my psyche and make my problems 10x worse.", "YTA you\u2019re taking it too far.I\u2019d rather have had him volunteer at a program - something to do with drug use, perhaps? The type of punishment you\u2019re inflicting will only teach him to hide his drug use better the next time. Take the opportunity to teach him something valuable. There\u2019s a reason why prisoners who are locked up, reoffend - while those who go to programs do much better in terms of recividism. Just my two cents", "Yeah, YTA\n\nExpect your kid to sneak and hide stuff until he's an adult and goes NC with you.\n\nHe had an unopened vape cartridge. This was the opportunity to actually educate him and discuss the risks why he shouldn't vape at his age. Instead you went full lockdown like he murdered someone.\n\nYou also sound like a \"Reefer Madness\" type who oversensationalizes the \"risk\" of THC. Frankly, marijuana laws are antiquated and racist in origin, and should have been removed from the Schedule 1 classification.\n\nYes. He did something stupid. He's also 13, don't entirely ruin his existence.", "Strict parenting just leads to sneaky kids who don\u2019t trust you", "YTA\n\nTwo weeks or so yeah, I'd be the same with my kids, but a whole 6 months? Good luck when he needs to go therapy in a few years.", "Friends of mine that grew up like this are often in and out of jail or struggle with methadone clinics and addiction. Did the kid even use pot or just have a cartridge and try to sell it like he found it and wanted 20 bucks for it? Parents that put friends of mine through this kind of stuff for smoking pot turned many of them into coke heads and pill poppers and the tests to detect those are easier to get around and its out of the system faster. Friends that never got caught experimenting with weed and psychedelics often turned out fine. Non addictive material that basically is a phase for many people. Problems with the harder easy to get around drug tests for stuff is the extremely addictive nature of it.", "YTA. He's on probation. At school he's subject to random searches and will be expelled if caught a second time. He's already being punished.\n\nYou said he was charged with minor in possession. Would his possession of the vape cartridge be legal if he was older? If so, you're massively overreacting.\n\nWould you give him a milder punishment if he was caught with a six-pack of beer instead? If so, lighten up.", "Did you ever consider, you know, treating your son like a human being and talking to him? \n\nAll you\u2019re really doing is telling him he\u2019s not safe with you, and cannot confide in you. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI dont know what your dynamics are, but I highly recommend some parenting books and education, as the whole \"prison system\" dynamic doesn't even work in the real world, and being overly punitive isn't benefiting anyone. Natural consequences are the best way for kids to learn (and he is still at an age where he's learning, about the world around him, about laws and rules, cause and effect). \n\nYour current reaction isn't teaching him anything.", "NTA for now, but I would consider sitting him down periodically to see what he thinks about it and also let him earn back some minor privileges, like picking clothes or having a friend over for a movie/short activity. You don\u2019t want him to become hopeless. People do stupid things when they feel like they have no options. You also don\u2019t want him to go from no freedoms to all the freedom at the end of probation - also a recipe for him doing stupid things.", "YTA just for some of the punishments you\u2019re implementing.. like picking his own clothes, being forced to exercise and what he eats. I totally get where you think you\u2019re doing with this punishment but I think those things are just a bit overboard-the rest I agree with. My husband is a CO at a super max prison but your son is 13 and has never been in this type of trouble before. He absolutely needs serious consequences and between the legal ones and the ones at home.", "Info: are the chores and not being purchased extra things when you go out part of the punishment?\n\nI agree some degree of consequences would be necessary but chores and not having extra things bought for you every time you go out seems.... Like a pretty standard thing, not a punishment.", "I mean you do you? You are the parent. But I think you should focus more on explaining why what he did was wrong rather than treating him like a prisoner. He's 13, he probably saw it on tik tok or something, while punishing him is good, you are being too strict on him. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWow ok, as much as you think you\u2019re teaching him a lesson by treating him like a literal prisoner!! This will actually do more harm then good. He\u2019s young, he made a mistake, I\u2019m not saying there shouldn\u2019t be any punishment or anything but treating him like a low life criminal instead of your son is kinda gross. Like seriously you\u2019re his parents!! How about talking to him about the dangers of drugs at a young age or something? But nope you decided to go full nuclear on him", "I think you\u2019re NTA at the moment but you should really come up with a system of earning privileges back over the course of 6 months. He\u2019s 13 and he\u2019s going to do stupid reckless stuff. You need to show him there\u2019s a way to earn trust back and that he can make up for doing wrong by demonstrating that he can do right. I mean even prisoners can earn privileges in jail through good behavior\u2026.", "INFO: Did you communicate why this was so bad to him? The risks of vaping and why those are so scary and detrimental to a child? \n\nESH- this sort of a punishment isn\u2019t too shocking but at the same time not allowing him to choose what he wants to eat and wear is way too much. You\u2019re stripping him of basic ind\u00e9pendance and that isn\u2019t okay. Six months of this as well? You\u2019re going to be lucky if your child doesn\u2019t go low to no contact with you. Without proper communication, he\u2019s going to learn how to hide this sort of thing instead of talking to you.", "YTA - All this over an unopened THC vape cartridge? Utterly ridiculous.", "Your son is so close to getting expelled. Stressing him out so much at home is likely to create an outburst at school. Like I genuinely, and without any meanness, think you are setting your son up for failure. If you're going to do this, at least do it over summer break. Right now he needs love and encouragement.", "YTA, do you honestly believe that the prison system pumps out reformed criminals? Because we all know it doesn\u2019t, why would you think that treating your son like he\u2019s in prison is going to work when it doesn\u2019t even work on regular prisoners. There are better ways to punish.", "YTA \n\nI understand that what he did could screw up his life forever but the punishment is a bit extreme. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he needs to realize that he messed up and won\u2019t get off easy but 6 months of not even being able to choose what he wears or eats? What kind of lesson is that supposed to teach? Unless you\u2019re really just taking the prison thing to the max. \n\nI think because he\u2019s at such an impressionable age he does need to be able to make choices. You can and should guide those choices but he does have to learn. And it\u2019s important that his punishment doesn\u2019t blow up in your face. You want him to learn the right lesson. Not learn to hide even more from you. \n\nWhy not instead of be 100% prison for the entire 6 months, you allow him to earn his privileges back? That way you start giving him more freedom and opportunity to make choices (hopefully good ones) but he\u2019s still aware that things are not okay and he needs to prove he\u2019s turning his behavior back around.", "YTA. He got into trouble and the courts and school punished him. Ground, ok. Electronics restriction, ok. Not letting him choose what he eats or wears or does? That is going to fOck him up. You are institutionalizing him. He is at an age where he needs to make choices and test limits. You are crippling him.", "YTA- He already has consequences from court and school. What he needs at home is to be educated on drugs and alcohol and how they affect his future. He may benefit from counseling and even taking him to an NA/AA group meeting with a speaker. Taking everything away and being up his ass isn't going to change what happened or stop it in the future. All it's going to do is create resentment and encouraging more sneaking and lying.", "NTA, whether people think this is reasonable or not, he suffered significant consequences for it, and therefore it WAS a serious situation. It\u2019s one thing to smoke weed, another to do it as a teenager, yet another to do it at 13, and RIDICULOUS to take it TO SCHOOL. \n\nThe YTA comments talking about whether or not prison reform works is ridiculous. The reason prisoners reoffend is because their records make it really hard to get above belt jobs, because no decent place wants to hire a convict. You punishing him severely at home isn\u2019t going to recreate that problem. It\u2019s a stupid argument.", "YTA, y'all have taken this too far. Especially since you've stated that this is the first major offense he's committed. How was he after the school called police on him? Was he remorseful/understood the severity of him having this THC cartridge? He's being punished by the school, why do you feel the need to pile on more?\n\nEven prisoners have more rights than what you're giving your son TBH. All you're doing is making your son resent you guys and never come to you again for anything thar may make you guys do this severe punishment again.", "NTA for trying to discipline but chosing what he can wear and eat is little excessive", "NTA- I call that good parenting.", "YTA. There are so many other things that have been suggested that would be more helpful than what you are doing.", "NTA and you aren't treating your son \"like a prisoner.\" Prison is brutal and frequently violent. Your son is experiencing social restrictions but he isn't behind bars in an institution designed to be dehumanizing.", "NTA\n\nYour son was selling drugs at school. He may not have gotten in trouble before, but this isn\u2019t a first time offense, just a first time getting caught. \n\nPersonally, I find your solution to be over the top and my experience is that heavy handed solutions that require a lot of parent time are easy for the kids to manipulate. \n\nBut nothing you\u2019ve mentioned is illegal or abusive. So tell your son to suck it up - if he can commit a felony, he\u2019s going to have to get used to paying the price", "NTA and this sounds like a brilliant idea", "NTA your prison sim is still better than real prison", "NTA. Little Tikes House Arrest sounds a lot better than the real deal or a juvenile residential facility, but 6 months is a little long. 3 months is more appropriate since it's his first time, and let him earn back privileges.", "Nta. However, you might want to let him earn time off for good behavior. Set goals and if he meets them he gets 1 reward at a time.that gives him a light at the end of the tunnel to work toward and the ability to show he has changed (edit typo)", "NTA While I personally don\u2019t think smoking weed is going to lead him to prison he did get in trouble and needs to be punished. Some people on here are saying he\u2019s getting punished other places and that should be enough, I don\u2019t agree. If there\u2019s no punishment at home then it\u2019s basically saying you\u2019re okay with what he did, which you\u2019re not. BTW anyone who thinks reading and exercise are over the top punishments should not have children, making him do these activities for 6 months will hopefully develop into habits he\u2019ll continue afterwards.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nYou need to focus on the other thing prison - at least in my country - is doing; rehabilitation.\n\nYou need to find professional help so your son will walk down a different path.\n\nRight now you are institutionalizing him.", "NTA it\u2019s tough love. Hopefully this nips it in the bud (no pun intended) before it gets worse.", "YTA. THINK if it was helpful for him he would\u2019ve get into prison.there\u2019s a god damn reasons police let him go.", "NTA but I think the restrictions should start winding down sooner than 6 months provided he\u2019s behaving himself. That\u2019s a long time with no friends. I would allow friends on weekends and birthdays after 2 months of good behavior if his friends weren\u2019t involved in the THC vape incident.

Yes, it even puts the parents at risk. OP never said his drug tests were positive, so it seems like this kid saw a financial opportunity.

I don\u2019t think the full 6 months of doing this on top of his legal obligations is fully necessary, but this is something to take serious for sure.

I said no, because it was 2AM on a weeknight and we have neighbors. 30 minutes later, I came out to the living room to find no kids.

I did something that caused my step father to lose his life and i got put in juvenile detention.\n\nAnd at the time i was glad i did it because juvenile detention was 100% better than there and the abuse i suffered.

It can change the trajectory of this young person\u2019s life and family dynamic permanently for the worst.\n\nI didn\u2019t even mention the lack of autonomy over *what he can wear.* This is such a critical time for young people (especially when it comes to their identity), and my heart breaks that he may not feel like he has any happy places, at home or at school. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s why he got his hands on the stuff in the first place. Maybe he\u2019s already struggling. Why add insult to injury? I\u2019d love to hear his perspective, if only so he can feel heard. His feelings are valid, even if they aren\u2019t how a well-adjusted adult would feel. This type of punishment just seems like a temporary band-aid that could allow the real issue to fester under the surface. I don\u2019t think this level of punishment even tries to get to the actual problem.\n\nPeople make mistakes; kids especially are expected to make mistakes. You know what? Even parents make mistakes, like OP in my opinion. Perfection is impossible, especially at 13. I would want kids to feel like I\u2019m a safe place \u2014 not a drill instructor or prison guard. That doesn\u2019t mean you look the other way. I just think there is a better way, a healthier way, than OP\u2019s current plan.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think it does anyone any good to lock them up and throw away the key.
