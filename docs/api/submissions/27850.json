Needless to say, we almost instantly regretted our decision. \n\nThe iPad quickly became an issue.

If she took to long to respond, her mother and grandmother would text repeatedly wondering what was going on. She couldn\u2019t focus on tasks, activities, or even meals for more than 5 minutes because she was worried her mom and grandmother would get upset at her for not responding. It\u2019s extremely upsetting, especially for my husband that our entire weekend with her is wasted because her mom and grandmother won\u2019t leave her alone. We only see her every other weekend. Her mother knows she can call to speak to SD at any given time and we will never deny that, but all day is absolutely ridiculous. Her mom and grandma don\u2019t see an issue with it, but it\u2019s a big problem for us. We want her to be able to focus on her us, game time, her toys, having movie time, playing with her baby brother, and god forbid EATING without worrying about texting her mom and grandmother back.

At other times, they can can call or text you if they want to stay in contact.", "NTA but the problem seems to be more with her mother and grandmother constantly interfering with her visitation time with your family more then the iPad itself. That\u2019s just a conduit. I\u2019d address their behavior more than anything else.", "I started reading this thinking one way and you delightfully took it in a whole other direction. Definitely NTA. But this might be your husband's battle to fight. There is no reason why an 8 year old should feel tied to a screen all day. Hopefully hubby can tactfully explain that you are limiting screen time so don't be alarmed if you don't get an immediate response. Good \ud83e\udd1e luck.", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t tell her to not bring it; it\u2019s a new toy for her, so its exciting! However, I would set a time limit with it, and inform her mom & grandma about that time, too. Explain to them that it\u2019s an issue, and maybe she only will have access to it between certain hours of the day? Or maybe she can only use it for a certain amount of hours in a day? I\u2019d also reaffirm to them and SD that you are not trying to limit their contact with each other at all, as they can call anytime desired.

It sounds to me like your stepdaughter is having to sacrifice too much of her own well-being in order to avoid strife when she\u2019s at her mom\u2019s place. \n\nBest case scenario is the stepdaughter just needs to tell her mom and grandmother how the constant communication is making her feel, but it\u2019s also possible that the mom and grandmother will put their own desires ahead of the child and will continue to expect on-demand contact.  If that\u2019s the case then you can start considering escalating to insisting that the device stays at home or other methods of regulating the amount of contact to a level where your stepdaughter feels comfortable.", "You (both you and husband) could have her leave it, or if she has to bring it, you can make rules to help her establish boundaries Talk to your step daughter about what she'd like to be able to do or not.

If she agrees they are, find a solution together her - mute, airplane mode, or even leaving it behind and blaming you for forbid it - bit with her agreement\n\nOR\n\nb) File a complain in relation to the court order.

If it\u2019s an emergency- the mom calls house phone or Dads cell to reach daughter. \nExplain its disruptive and winds up making daughter anxious in case she gets a text/call from mom or grandmother. \nOr she leaves it home- and only uses the ones available at your home during weekend visits. \nRules and boundaries are healthy things- there is no need to check in incessantly when she is with you.", "NTA", "NTA.

And it sounds like it's started. \n\nYou need to try to give your SD the emotional tools to not be at the beck and call of a message on a device. Empower her to know that none of us are slaves to message or email, and that we do not function on someone else's time scale.\n\nEasier said than done I know but this goes beyond \"don't bring your ipad\".\n\nTablets are great devices for all ages when used appropriately.", "You have an 8 year old stepdaughter at the age of 24?", "Nope.

Have your husband restrict her screen time. \n\nIf mom gets mad that she can't text her kid 24/7 you have bigger problems. As it is, I think there's issues if she's spending all her time worrying that mom will be upset if she doesn't respond instantly, and if that's the case, then taking the iPad away is going to make this manifest in a new way.", "Your house. Your rules. Including limiting screen time. Which is a good rule to have anyway.\n\nNTA", "Why not fight fire with obnoxious text.  She is after all your husband's daughter too and he has every right to contact her when he wants.   See how she likes it.", "YWBTA. This is between your husband, his daughter, and his ex. You should stay out of it.", "YWBTA. This should be a conversation for her dad to have with her mom. He needs to ask them to not be so intrusive during his time with his daughter. Also you both need to teach her about boundaries and how to manage technology so it doesn't become all encompassing and cause her a lot of anxiety as she gets older. If she wants you to temporarily \"ban\" it so she can get a break - okay - but the problem will need to be addressed head on eventually.", "YWBTA\n\nI see where you're coming from, but it sounds like it's the mom and grandma's issues that are causing the problems if it's them texting, facetiming, etc. Banning the Ipad would lead to issues between your stepdaughter and them.", "YWBTA. Her father needs to discuss this with her mother. YOU need to stay in your lane, which is SM. You can talk to your husband about it and he talks to his ex. If he decides to take some action, you should not take an role in that action. You don\u2019t take away her iPad, you don\u2019t t scold her. At most you can try and encourage her to do some activities that will take her mind off the iPad on the weekends she\u2019s with her father. \n\nBut my god, do not become the enforcer. It will not turn out well for you, your husband and most importantly, his daughter.", " What does SD mean? Maybe she doesn't like being with you for some reason. If you're honest what are the reasons it could be?", "YWBTA if you restricted access. NTA allowing her father needs to take point on this one. She can bring it but only use it during certain periods or not at all. It is on your husband to set those boundaries. Keep your role as the bonus parent and let the bio parents hash it out. This gives her a safe person to speak with at her second home.", "I\u2019m a bit confused. You said you\u2019re a 24F with a 8SD. And in the comments you also say you\u2019ve been in life since she was two, which would put you at a mere 18 years old? \n\nRespectfully, I would stay in your own lane and let her father and mother deal with it as they see fit.", "YWBTA", "YTA. Not your child, nor your place. Yes you may be in her life, but you are not her mother nor are you her father. You don\u2019t get to tell her she can\u2019t bring a gift to your house. Honestly dad doesn\u2019t either because it just seems like you two don\u2019t want mom or grandma in communication with said child.", "Yta.  This is a good tone to talk about boundaries.

Teach your SD how to manage her device and set boundaries with her mom and grandma so that they don't cause her so much anxiety.

There is absolutely NO reason she needs to be up her daughters ass 24/7 other than trying to take time away from her dad.", "NTA, but I don't think the problem here is the iPad. It's the mom/grandma. Depending on the relationship between Mom and dad, I would hope that a meaningful conversation about the stress this is causing the daughter and the degree it is interfering with meaningful connections with her would help Mom understand she needs to back off. \n\nBut, it seems like this was a contentious divorce and custody battle, and the mom might be trying to build a case against dad. Or she is nervous about something and doesn't trust you and your husband. \n\nIf she continues to interfere like this, your husband should bring it up with his attorney.
