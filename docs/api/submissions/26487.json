You've stated your case now it's her decision to make.", "NTA. I'm an overweight woman and never hike. \n\nYou're definitely right to plan hikes around the slowest person in the group (that's smart), and it's nice that you invited her to do a different, easier hike another time.

She can go hike with her partner. No need to cut your hike short.", "NTA\n\nJust proceed. She claims she can do it so go on and don't wait for her. If she can make it that's good, if she can't too bad for her.", "NTA", "NTA, but rather than trying to discourage her, maybe you could have suggested that she and her partner simply start earlier since she prefers to hike more slowly.", "NTA Your sister is REALLY inconsiderate. Do the hike with your partner, and leave them behind if they can't keep up. It's not your responsibility to suffer for the fact that she can't hike as fast as you do. You gave her other options, and she rejected them. That's on HER.", "NTA. Tell her and her husband to get as far as they can and they can turn around and go back down with you guys.

Go on your hike if she keeps up great, if not maybe that will be enough personal embarrassment for her to take better care of her health.

You should have told her the first thing (\u201cwe want to make it a private hike, so we\u2019d rather you not join\u201d) instead of telling her you\u2019d be mean to her if she joined.

A vacation with the entire family (and the weights of decades of judgement) can be frustrating for everyone.
