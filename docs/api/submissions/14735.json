The past 5 years have been extremely difficult on my sister, her husband my two nephews and niece, and my mom who has been the only one providing money for them all. About one year ago, my fianc\u00e9 and I drove about an hour and a half away to pick up my family so that they could move out of the 'house' they were living in. They had been living there for about a year after had being evicted for violations. When we finally got there it was terrible. They were all (including moms boyfriend) living in a shed in the backyard of a neighbors house and they never once said a word about the living conditions. They showered and went to the bathroom outside, no electricity or heating. As they are getting their stuff packed, my sister tells me that they've already found an extended stay hotel that they can afford until they get their apt they were also waiting for, they just needed 2 days at our place.\n\n1 month later, they were still living with us, so my mom decided that since she's the only one who has a stable job and a car, she told me that she would be the one looking for an apartment and sis, husband and the kids can stay with her so that they can have some form of stability. The entire 6 months of them living with us, no one got a job and mom never even attempted to look for an apt. During their stay here the only parenting I ever saw my sis do was scream at the kids all day, get mad when they cried, constantly high strung and not attentive to the kids.\n\nSis & BIL took the kids outside almost all day everyday no matter how hot it was. I assumed it's because they technically just lived outside the last two years. The kids are stressed out, have no proper nutrition given that my sister and BIL only feed them canned food and crackers, never any protein and only juices with high sugar and candy. I won't mention details but I have seen her disciplinary actions towards younger son as bordering abuse. She favors oldest son because he's autistic. He now is showing signs of extreme aggression and anger problems. Due to the instability of sis and mom, the kids have seen tremendous amounts of fighting, physical contact and so much screaming and hostility within the family unit. After a not-so-nice goodbye, 6 months later they are still living in a hotel, I have no idea where mom is when she was supposed to be providing for her grandchildren.\n\nIf I call CPS my family will never forgive me and i'm afraid of sis's declining mental health after kids possibly getting taken away to BIL parents. She is also contemplating divorce and god knows where she would even go. But I need the kids to be stable, they deserve better than what sis and I grew up with.

You've said it yourself - your sister's kids aren't safe, healthy or cared for, and the two people in the world who should be MOST concerned about that - their parents - aren't.  Help them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Calling CPS is the most compassionate thing you can do at this stage in the game.", "NTA. These children need to be in a much better situation than what they're currently dealing with. Even if it causes a rift (and probably will tbh) you'll know you did right by those kids.

CPS does more than just take kids away. I've worked with families where the kids not only stayed with the parents, but CPS used their resources to help set them up with stable housing, doctors, clothes, beds, school supplies, etc. They might even be able to help the parents with job and childcare resources.", "INFO: Do you truly think the kids will be better off in foster care or a group home?", "Just offering info: \n\nI work with CPS frequently, and I don't think there's anything there CPS can do anything about. Maybe when they were living in the shed, but even then it would have been a maybe. \n\nIt takes a LOT for the government to be able to forcibly remove children from their parents, and CPS can't really do anything until that point is reached.", "NTA. as far as I'm concerned children take precedent overall, even if it hurts.

Call cps", "Please call your local school district.

My family all knew she wasn\u2019t fit but they prioritized her over him. I made a mistake and it\u2019s haunted me for 10 years but even worse he had a miserable childhood that I could have prevented.

Would be so much better for them to be closer to responsible adults (herself) and only once removed from their parents if OP is in a position to do so. Social services/foster system may be able to be set up to assist with a stipend to help support. And CPS could probably render a series of requirements that have to be met in order for mom & dad to get their kids back (stable employment for x amount of time, stable and acceptable dwelling for x amount of time, anger management, etc). It\u2019s almost always best not to permanently yank children away from their parents if at all possible. Of course, sometimes that is for the best.", " Typically, based on the information given to the family, it can be determined who called. Certain situations require that the source's occupation is stated. This is usually only with mandated reporters and is not standard across states. BUT, with all this said, a source's name is protected by federal law. CPS will never give the name of a source. If they do, they are subject to a whole lot more than lawsuits.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Calling CPS is never an easy decision. I wish you luck through the process. \n  \nSource: I was a teacher, and my mom was a social worker.", "Y T A for not calling during any of the time you described. I understand that it\u2019s really, really tough to stand up to and potentially hurt family members.

Her 3 year old foster son would have huge screaming like a banshee tantrums. Someone called and said it sounded like she was beating him. (Was dismissed immediately) but anyway. She asked and they told her straight out the name of the person who called. It was a house across the street, literally someone who had used her home daycare for years and had been good friends with her. Also no way she heard these tantrums. My mom had discussed them with her. So... yeah. Anyway, point is they straight out told her the name and my mom would not have ever guessed that, she thought it was a neighbor on either side who could actually hear the tantrums"]}
