When we did our planning we decided it would be a child free event. Of course there were some exceptions. The flower girls who are my nieces were coming as they were in the wedding.\n\nMy cousin Teresa asked to bring her 3 boys. I kindly told her no, that it was a child free wedding. If she couldn\u2019t find a babysitter we understand and we would miss her at the wedding\u2026but no kids. She was not happy she called my mom, my husband, my siblings, anyone who would listen and explained how it wasn\u2019t fair that my nieces were there but her sons could not be. She also could not afford a babysitter and she should be able to bring them. I stood firm and each time it was brought up I said no. \n\nDay of the wedding rolls around and cousin Teresa brings her 3 boys. I was furious. I didn\u2019t want to ruin my husband and my day by starting something so I left it alone and enjoyed my wedding. The next day I asked her why she would do that and she said she couldn\u2019t find a babysitter and the kids deserved to be there too. I was pissed. It was 3 extra people we hadn\u2019t expected and I had told her over 10 times no.\n\nShe is now playing the victim and saying I hate kids. She is talking about me to family members saying her kids felt bullied by not getting invited. Her kids feel like I don\u2019t like them. Which, is not true. The boys are great and very polite. They are 5,7 and 9 but I wanted no kids because I don\u2019t want people running after them and focusing on them. My cousin is making a whole mess that me and my husband are done dealing with.\n\nSo, AITA? Do kids HAVE to be at weddings?", "created_utc": 1690638048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15csmbs/aita_for_not_having_kids_at_my_wedding/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So just . . . stop calling them \"child-free weddings\". Invite the people you want there, including or not including kids, which is what you should be doing anyway, and stop using self-limiting \"official\" statements.\n\nBut honestly, I don't understand people's weird entitlement about stuff like this anyway. Why would you want your kids to be at a wedding where they aren't welcome and the hosts don't want them there? And WTF does \"they deserve to be there\" even mean?

Some don\u2019t want little ones running all over the place and getting into things while their parents are off chatting it up with Aunt Susie and Uncle Bob instead of watching them. Alcohol is often served which in my opinion is not a kid friendly environment as some decide to get extra drunk at weddings especially when there\u2019s an open bar. In some situations it\u2019s also a way to cut back on the guest list. Say you want to invite your 5 cousins and 3 besties from college, which you can afford with each bringing a plus 1, but they each have 2-4 kids. If you\u2019re welcoming kids at the wedding, that\u2019s an additional 20-25+ people with just the 8 of them, not counting all of the other guests who have children.", "ESH.

I mean, basically the party isn't going to be kid-friendly (not that it has to be) so those parents are going to have to leave early to get the kids home and in bed, instead of them getting to hire a babysitter and enjoy the wedding like everyone else.

I also got to wear a pretty dress, make a fool of myself on the dance floor and eat cake! My kids haven't been invited to any weddings now that they're older than lap infants. I have never once said anything to the couples as it's not my place. But they're always disappointed not to be included if it's someone they know.
