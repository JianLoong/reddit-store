They still live with my parents, and I bought my first house a few months ago about 30 min away. We don\u2019t have a very close relationship as a family (we never did \u201csit down dinners\u201d together, or talk much in general) but I felt so proud to invite my family into my house that I bought by myself after years of saving. My mom is a hoarder so to have my own space for the first time (I lived with them through college too) felt so freeing. \n\nLast week i invited them to my house for my first family dinner at my house. I was upstairs when my mom and sisters rang the doorbell. When I came downstairs, excited to invite them in, my mom had used the spare key I gave her a few weeks back to let themselves in. She had trouble with the deadbolt so i could hear her doing the same door jerking/pulling motion we have to do for my parents house that\u2019s loud and aggressive (that you don\u2019t need to do for my door, you just have to turn the key all the way) before letting herself in when I was still coming down the stairs. \n\nI got pretty upset and asked her why she wouldn\u2019t wait for me to open the door and she said I was taking too long and they were carrying things. As she was saying this she walked to the kitchen to put her stuff down, took her jacket and bags and put it on my couch. I angrily told her to not just unlock my door, and she said why would I give her a key if she can\u2019t use it? And that when my aunt (who also lives nearby) has fam dinners, she keeps the front door unlocked and we let ourselves in as well. The dinner was awkward and before they left my sister sarcastically asked if I needed to open the door for them to leave as well. \n\nMy mom and sisters thought I was the AH for getting upset ruining my own party, that they are family so I shouldn\u2019t be so uptight about it being \u201cmy\u201d space and that I was treating them like strangers. \n\nOf course I want my fam, especially my younger sisters to feel comfortable at my new house since growing up our home was never quite felt like \u201cours\u201d with the hoarding and constant clutter. And I do feel bad for losing my temper on a special occasion. But I never expected them to just let themselves into my house. It\u2019s hard to describe why it bothers me so much, maybe violated is the closest word I can think of? This is the first time I\u2019m inviting my parents and siblings to my house, and she\u2019s already acting like this is her home.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698690067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jzx2d/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_for_letting_herself/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Me taking too long to open the door was not an emergency. Just to be clear, I would prefer for you to knock and/or call once you arrive instead of letting yourself in.\"\n\n\nNTA, but losing it right away is definitely a trauma response from what you have dealt with living with a hoarder. \n\n\nI would recommend apologizing for the outburst, and at the same time set the boundary that the key is not to be used whenever they feel like it.", "NTA. You need to take back the key you gave your mother.  I understand the reason you were upset.  Your mother is a hoarder and she walked in with a bunch of things.  PTSD kicking in I believe.", "NTA.  Change the locks. Asking for the key back doesn't account for copies. My parents never locked their doors. I always lock my doors.  You are allowed to have different standards and practices than others, even your family.  I recommend not explaining your feelings beyond \"personal preference.\"", "NTA.  One it's your house.  If you don't want people just coming in whenever or letting themselves in that's fine.  And if your aunt is good with that, that's fine, you're not.  It's your house do what you want.  Plus it feels like part of this may also be the fact that this took away part of the experience of you being a host in this situation and properly welcoming them to your house.  So that might be something to mention.  Maybe you would be okay eventually with people letting themselves in.  But you also don't have to be.  It's your house and whatever you're okay with.  And honestly the spare key line is bs.  A spare key is never for letting yourself in when you were invited over like that.  That's not what a spare key is for.  In the end it's really whatever you're okay with.  That's all", "NTA, it sounds like boundary's need to be established, hope this helps", "NTA. I\u2019d take back the keys and explain they are was be used in an event that no one is home and you need them to do something.", "Please change the locks, don\u2019t try to get the key back.

Congrats on the house!", "NTA\n\nGet the key back. She doesn\u2019t need one.", "NTA, assuming you gave her the key for emergencies only, and explained that when you gave it to her. Holding things while you are trying to get to the door isn't an emergency. It is at best an inconvenience. You are probably going to have to change your locks and give a copy of the new key to a trusted friend who understands what emergencies are.\n\nI come from a family that always walks in as well. I don't like that, never have. I always knock when I arrive and wait for someone to either open the door or holler to come in. In my house, all it took was for someone to walk in when I was not dressed to end that practice when they come to my house. I am not suggesting that you stay naked so that people learn to knock. It was an accident, but it was effective on my family.", "NTA. Wow this was not about them carrying things and you taking too long at all. It seems like it was about control to her. She was signaling by boundary stomping that she\u2019ll do as she\u2019ll please with your house and on top of that making you out to be the crazy person for having an issue (rightfully so!!) with people using an emergency key to let themselves in when they please and thereby also take away your joy and pride to welcome them into the house for the first time you worked so hard for. \nIt\u2019s a power play to stomp on your newfound independence. There is only one solution IMO and that is to protect you mental health and boundaries by changing the lock and not give another emergency key. And if it\u2019s difficult to you, you don\u2019t even need to proactively tell her that. Good luck OP", "I'm 50/50 on this. It depends on how long they were waiting, and they were invited. If your mom does this without being invited, then I would say take your key back.", "Ooooh, this is a good one.\nClearly, you need your own private space and boundaries, even if you didn\u2019t realize it when you gave your mom the key.  So you have to get the key back, or change the locks.

Real time. 5 minutes is a long time if you are standing there holding packages.\n\nIf I am holding packages and you take a long time to come downstairs and open the door, I'm letting myself in if you gave me a key.

I mean my nuclear family (as long as everyone knows who\u2019s coming over when) just let ourselves in, we actually prefer it that way to be honest - less of a hassle. \n\nHowever, now that you have made it clear that you don\u2019t like that, she would be TA if she continued doing that.

You can still have a physical key but you can also create Guest access codes and set them for a specific time range. So say, you need your mom or another member of your family to watch your house for a week - you can give them a temporary code that will expire when you set it too.

Keys given to family members are only for emergencies. Like if she needs to get in for whatever reason and you\u2019re not there. When visiting someone, it always needs to be established whether you\u2019re allowed to just walk in, and she didn\u2019t get permission for that. She especially shouldn\u2019t have just walked in when the door was locked. Even my mom, one of the most intrusive people ever, waits for me to yell \u201ccome in\u201d before entering my house. I keep the door unlocked when I\u2019m expecting company but I still expect everyone to follow the one rule to knock (or ring the doorbell) and wait for me to either open the door or yell, because it\u2019s my house. Just like your house is yours and no one should be just walking in without you giving permission to do so. If I were you, I\u2019d change the locks before your mom can make this a habit. Or maybe install chains on the doors so she can unlock the doors but still can\u2019t get in (might be fun to watch the struggle).", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't discuss this any more.

I know all of us are saying the same thing but please change your locks ASAP or get them re-keyed. A locksmith can quote you both to see what's cheaper in your area. If your mother has hoarder tendencies, she's going to see your home as another place to 'store her things'. Save yourself a lot of grief and arguments to change those locks Now. You can set boundaries until your blue but it doesn't sounds as if she respects them. \n\nAlso, invite your sisters only over for a separate dinner to explain you want them to be comfortable at your home. I would highly suggest a doorbell camera of some kind at least. There are a few that are wireless so it's a quick and easy install via an app.  Good luck OP!", "NTA.

I assure you they'll be in your house while you're at work, shopping, whatever.", "I'd suggest maybe a Weiser key pad -- you can't lose your key, so that cuts out one emergency.

I honestly mentally compared this more to like when my mom would vacuum my room when I wasn\u2019t home and move everything to do so (but ofc her boxes will stay in the same spot for years) and why I felt so exponentially bothered by it even remembering it now, and she would get mad since I should be thankful she\u2019s vacuuming for me in the first place.

I truly never expected her to just let herself in for my own party though", "This. If we\u2019re going to a friend\u2019s house for a dinner party they\u2019d think it was weird (and AH-ish) not to just let ourselves in, or vice-versa. OP you\u2019re letting the extra baggage around your mom cloud your judgement. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have a key, but maybe you also should have left the door unlocked for when you expected your guests."]}
