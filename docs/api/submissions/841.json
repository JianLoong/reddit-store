Every year on his birthday, my mother, sister, aunt, and I take him to the zoo. His birthday is right around Halloween weekend, and the zoo does a Halloween weekend celebration, so its always great fun. He loves it, and it gives his mom a day to herself to relax. \n\nThis year, my mom insisted (demanded, really) that I bring my daughter with us too. The problem with that is my daughter is only 16 months old. Yes, we brought my nephew at that age, but he lives 10 minutes away from the zoo. I'm a 90 minute drive away. \n\nMy daughter takes a two hour nap like clockwork at 11 every day, and if she doesn't take one, or it's late, she turns into an absolute BEAR. She won't sleep in the car or in her stroller; nap conditions have to be exactly right. \n\nThe entire trip is generally about 7-8 hours including drive time. I knew full well that if I brought my daughter, she would have enjoyed it for five minutes, and then cried the rest of the time, ruining everyone else\u2019s day. So I made the decision to leave her home with my husband. \n\nI warned my mom in advance that I planned to do this, but she still BLEW UP at me when I arrived to the zoo without her. She bitched at me all day, but I thought she got over it by the end of the day. \n\nI was wrong. Yesterday was Halloween, and my husband and I brought our daughter to see my inlaws (they live 10 min away). My mom saw the pictures, and I've been getting a barrage of hateful texts. Shes been calling me and my husband nasty names, and she's accusing me of playing favorites by allowing my in-laws to see my daughter on Halloween, but not her. \n\nFor the record, my mom sees my daughter three days a week, every week. And I do bring her with me for shorter visits, or on trips closer to home. \n\nMy mom is saying I deprived my daughter of a good time and deprived my family of seeing her because I'm lazy and don't care about my family. At first, I just dismissed it as her throwing a tantrum, but then even my husband said that I should have just brought her, but stayed for a shorter time.\n\nI still think I made the right choice, but did I?

Seeing your kids is a gift, not a right.  I think you might need to start setting some boundaries with mom.  Whenever she's being demanding and uncivil, a week of no visits is in order.  Every time the boundary is broken, the clock restarts with an extra week tacked on.\n\nShut this down now or be prepared for 17 more years of this treatment.

We have a general bedtime but it fluctuates depending on the days schedule. For instance school/work nights kids in bed by 8 sometimes 9 if things happen. Non school/work days bedtime is whenever you start acting out/whining (usually 10/11 which is great because they let you sleep in the next day). Naps happen whenever the kid falls asleep but usually no later that 4pm. And the kids all fall asleep wherever they are it could be anywhere from a family get together to my aunts hair salon or even just the hallway at the house etc. It\u2019s not scheduled there\u2019s nothing special that they need to go to sleep they just get tired and will lay down.

Believe me, we've tried. \n\nIf she naps, she's a happy, sweet little girl. If she doesn't, she will cry, getting increasingly louder and more miserable. By 12, if the nap is missed, it\u2019s an all out holy fit. \n\nSo for the time being, we do have to plan around her naps. She\u2019ll grow out of it soon.", "I will concur that many parents are slaves to nap times as life is really so much harder otherwise.  The cutest happiest baby can become a Tasmanian devil without a proper nap and make the remainder of the day torture.
