My oldest recently came out as trans, mtf. I have fully accepted her and honestly can\u2019t say I\u2019m overly surprised as she always loved feminine things, and I wish she felt comfortable coming out sooner. My youngest daughter, who was named after my grandmother, is about to turn 18. \n\nIt was always planned that my grandmothers ring would be passed down to her on her birthday as it was to be passed down to my daughter and at the time of my grandmothers passing, my youngest was my only daughter. It is also probably worth mentioning that it is not a very financially valuable ring, but has sentimental value in the family. \n\nRecently my oldest daughter has come to me asking for the ring as she\u2019s now the oldest daughter. I told her I felt that would be unfair to her sister as she was aware it was meant to be hers and had always loved it. She got upset with me and accused me of not fully accepting her, being a bigot and being unfair. But I don\u2019t want to disappoint my youngest daughter, especially just weeks before her birthday when she\u2019s supposed to get it.\n\nI told my oldest we could talk to her sister and see if she was okay with passing it on to my oldest and if she wasn\u2019t disappointed and agreed it should go to her big sister then it would be okay with me. But my oldest flipped out and said not to bother as I already made my feelings about her clear. She\u2019s now blocked me and stopped talking to me, and I feel so completely torn as I do accept her and love her the way she is. I just thought her sister deserves consideration in all this too, and she may have been willing to let her have it as she has accepted her sister completely.

Technicalities shouldn\u2019t get in the way of what\u2019s fair and reasonable. When I say technicalities, I\u2019m referring to the original plan for passing down the ring, not your oldest daughter\u2019s gender identity. The ring was promised to your youngest. You were not aware of your oldest daughter\u2019s gender identity when you made that promise and it wouldn\u2019t be fair if you nullified it because his sister recently came out. \n\nI think your oldest daughter is sort of testing you to see if you really do accept her for who she is. Instead if giving her the ring, maybe you could buy her a piece of jewelry of similar to mark your full acceptance of her true identity. That way both daughters have a piece of jewelry with sentimental value.", "NTA - she would take it from her sister weeks before she was supposed to get it and was excited about it ? that' s not very nice and your suggestion to ask was pretty good parent choice. \n\nLool you can work only with the information you have at the time, and I feel like your oldest daughter is being a bit of an AH to try to guilt you when you were stuck in an impossible decision to diapoint one of your daughters at any turn.", "NTA. This has been in place for a long time. Are there any other heirlooms that could be given to your oldest? \n\nThe oldest needs a good talking to. You can\u2019t just except everything to change and adapt to how you want them to be. The world doesn\u2019t work like that. It doesn\u2019t make a person bigoted", "NTA. Sorry, this is a suck situation, but your eldest will eventually have to accept that not everything is about her and her individual circumstances. Calling your own Mom a bigot is heavy, man. I know lots of trans kids who would give anything for parents that embrace them as they are. Sorry love. Hopefully as the newness wears off she can gain some perspective.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a FTM oldest son. I came out when I was 21, but I've known since I was about 19.\n\nMy younger brother has always been promised my mom's engagement ring/her jewelry for when he finds a partner, since until 5yrs ago I wouldn't have had a use for it (traditionally). I'm not going to demand that my mom give it to me instead now or accuse her of being a bigot for keeping true to her word from when we were kids. That's ridiculous. My mom still sees me as a man and is completely supportive of who I am. Not getting a ring doesn't change that. \n\nThough, maybe your daughter is struggling with her own self image and thought having the ring would make her feel more like the woman she's always been. Kind of like, attaching affirmation to an article of clothing or jewelry because it makes her feel more aligned with her gender/like people will take her seriously as the oldest DAUGHTER now because she had the ring. Maybe that's something you guys could explore together.", "NTA--You gave a fair solution for them to talk it out, so one child didn't feel blindsided.  That was the healthy approach.  She rejected that and frankly is giving no consideration to the fact that her younger sister could be deeply disappointed.", "NTA\n\nThis is a hard one, as I'm imagining your older daughter would love to have both the sentimental heirloom from her grandmother and the validation of being \"confirmed\" as the eldest daughter. However, at the time of your grandmother's passing, you specifically said which daughter was getting it, and it was the only daughter you knew of at the time. You're just holding it \"in trust\" until she's 18, which is only weeks away. It would be enormously unfair to now rip it away from her to give to your other daughter. \n\nIs there another piece of jewelry from your grandmother that could go to your elder daughter? Or something that could be converted to jewelry? I absolutely understand the importance of the heirloom, and I know you would love to have a way to validate your daughter that way. \n\nI hope that when she has some time to think about all of this, she understands that this is the fairest solution, and not to be meant in any way as a negative judgement of her.", "you're definitely nta but came close when you suggested you and your older daughter talk to her younger sister\n\ndon't put your youngest daughter in that position", "NTA\n\nThis was known for years, and the decision was made a long time ago.

From what you've written, your reasoning about giving it to her sister has nothing to do with your oldest being trans, but simply because your younger daughter had already been promised this ring a long time ago. I would talk to your younger daughter, but tbh your eldest's behavior is so unfair I'd be tempted to just stand your ground and say no.", "NTA.

It would be unfair not to give it to your younger daughter.", "NTA. It's always been said the ring would go to your youngest daughter, way before your oldest daughter transitioned. Just taking it away without checking the youngest daughter's feelings is cruel. You gave your oldest an option: to see how youngest feels first and if she's ok with it, oldest can have the ring. Your oldest daughter is being really immature.", "NTA your oldest is being a brat", "NTA.", "NTA. The ring has been promised to the youngest. I understand why the oldest wants the ring, but it would make you born TA to take it from the youngest at this point.\n\nEdit: to add this point: you are correcting a lot of people who have a political issue with this. You show that you DO consider her your daughter, and you aren\u2019t afraid to voice this publicly. Your daughter should be proud because her mother loves her. You are not a bigot.", "NTA how the hell is it your fault? You had a son and then a daughter you named AFTER YOUR MOTHER. How could you know that you were gonna give birth to a boy who now wants to become a girl? The whole LGBTQ community gets a bad rep when entitled assholes like your oldest daughter acts. Just because you decide you want to become a girl later doesn't give you the right to take something that rightfully belongs to your youngest one. Her calling you a bigot is honestly so disrespectful because you've already accepted her.\n\nSounds like she's calling you slurs to get what she wants. Don't let her play the victim card and put your foot down. Your youngest kid didn't ask to be born as the first girl in the family.", "NTA. Don't allow your older daughter to manipulate you. Your younger daughter was named after your grandmother, and it was \"always planned\" that this ring would be hers on her 18th birthday- this clearly had nothing to do with your love and support for your oldest daughter, who only recently came out as trans. There will be other special family things that your oldest daughter can have.", "NTA... it was promised to the 18 yr old, it would be cruel to take it back. This has nothing to do with trans", "nta your oldest sounds mentally ill", "[removed]", "NTA. As a trans woman, myself, I'd be absolutely crushed by this entire scenario, but it isn't your fault, and it sounds like you're doing your best. In another comment, you suggested giving her your wedding rings, and, to me, that would be incredibly meaningful, especially since your husband is no longer around. Tell her how happy you are to have two daughters, and make her promise to pass those rings along to HER daughter. I, honestly, can't personally think of anything that would make me feel more accepted as a daughter than my mother giving me her OWN wedding rings. You're a good mom. She's going through a lot, and if she just started HRT she's probably hormonal as hell and it can make any woman a bit unhinged at times. Give her some time. She'll come around.", "Adding that why is most of the case is like that, it has to be their way, or OP is a bigot? Jeez.", "I don't think anyone in this story is being unreasonable or mean. Your older daughter feels like you aren't treating her as the older daughter, and that feeling is accurate in respect to this ring. It isn't happening out of any bigotry on your part, you just don't want your youngest to feel cheated out of something.\n\nKind of want to say NAH. Hope you can figure out a way to reconnect. It isn't your fault that you made plans before you knew you had an older daughter.", "This is a hard situation, but I am leaning NAH unless there's things you left out.\n\nWhile yes, the tradition is for the oldest daughter, your family grew up with an expectation that your youngest child WAS your oldest daughter and the ring was promised to her from a young age.\n\nNow that you know your oldest child is actually your oldest daughter, this creates a really tough situation and a conflict of interest.\n\nI can see why your oldest feels slighted, because this ring tradition is a deep signifier of Daughter, and she feels she's being denied as a \"real\" daughter, because the decision of who to promise the ring to was made with incomplete information.  She probably still feels scared and is working through being accepted for who she is.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that it WAS promised to the younger one, and snatching that ring away from her at the last minute isn't fair either.  \n\nI'm sorry OP.  I'm not sure I have a good solution for you, other than to keep showing your eldest some compassion if/when she comes around.  Remind her this is about keeping your promise to her sister, not about making her feel invalid or as if she isn't really your eldest daughter.  That you hate that those things came into conflict, but that you can't see making it right by hurting her younger sister.  \n\nI hope everyone is able to heal and find a solution that feels affirming and loving.  Best of luck.", "This is a repost. I swear I've read this story before.", "This is a stolen story. The original was more detailed and included names and is also a few years old.", "NTA\n\nThis was already decided. If eldest has an issue then she can use a Time Machine and come out sooner. So very rude to just take over her sister\u2019s ring like that and then spin it into being the victim.", "NTA, your oldest \u201cdaughter\u2019s\u201d entitlement is nauseating. That ring belongs to your younger daughter.", " NTA. I don't think it's fair to pull the rug under the younger daughter and she may feel slighted but wanting to support her older sister if the decision is tossed upon her. It sounds like a no-win situation for her.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like the ring was intended to go to the oldest female, just the one it was planned to go to for 1.7ish decades and whom is named after the giver.\n\nIs it possible that grandma's ring, of the person of whom your daughter is named after, gets that ring. And your ring will now go to your oldest?  Is there another compromise here or is that your daughter's test of acceptance?", "NTA. It might be difficult to cut ties with your oldest daughter, even for a while, but remember that she's emotionally unstable and irrational. She appears to be jealous of her sister, which is blurring her mind.", "She\u2019s the youngest and the only female out of your two kids. Your oldest needs to deal with it", "NTA. My only thought is there a way to start a new tradition with your oldest daughter?  A different piece of jewelry or something else of interest?", "YTA. I see how it can be viewed as a symbol of acceptance but as you said your youngest had expectations for it and how youngest feels about the ring is important as well as your own emotional attachment to the plan.  I think your main failure is in presentation,  I don't think its fair/nice to basically say that you will give it if the youngest does not want it, for one because of how it sounds and for another because it shifts the reasonability from you to the youngest. if youngest says he wants it despite knowing the elder wants it then she looks like the A.", "I'm gonna go with NAH. You are not the asshole AT ALL. But transitioning is very hard. Your eldest daughter may have put it in her head that receiving grandma's ring would validate her gender in some way. Not a fair way to approach it, certainly not when your youngest has been promised it her whole life. But nothing about being trans is fair, and if she's approaching the ring situation from a place of gender dysphoria that may explain why she reacted the way she did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To put it in perspective: to her, it is unfair that she wasn't born a cis woman. Which is in direct opposition to the unfairness your youngest daughter might feel. She probably knows that it's irrational of her to demand the ring. There's probably a part of her that irrationally blames herself (for not being cis, for not figuring it out earlier).

OP\u2019s oldest decided to transition, nothing wrong with that. She\u2019s an adult and can make that decision.
