Honestly, my first reaction with such an old person would be to assume she suffers from some sort of dementia. She probably doesn't remember or doesn't know how to use a cell phone.

My husband (NJ raised) pulled the door closed and they gave him a WTF look. Our room was the first in the hallway, but we walked into the lounge for a minute. The outer door never opened and when we looked they were gone so we went to our room. \nThe next morning the car was still there and we saw the woman as we were headed out to our car.

Three adult me were afraid of a woman in her 50's? It was a nicer area and you didnt see anyone nearby? Wow, I know that if I had reacted that way, I would feel like a coward. \n\nDid you ever think that maybe she has cognitive issues and had lost her way? I'm sure if it was your grandma, you would be pissed at someone that refused to help. You could have told her to give you her grandsons number and called him yourself. You could have told her to wait and you would get her some help and then called the police to tell them a lady was lost and needed help. You could have asked her if she lived nearby. Instead you ran in your Airbnb and left her alone on the street and DID NOTHING. \n\nAsk you grandma how she feels about what you did. Yknow, it might be best if you kept this to yourself.

Not an elderly person these days.", "Thank you!", "They wrote older alone women (>60) - dementia is most common in people over 65 but how certain you are in your at glance age evaluation is up to you opinion.

I really meant it more like - over 60 someone looking out of place and lost (not aggressive, asking for help contacting relatives) will throw me thinking about that, but it is 100% my personal experience (relatives) that is biasing me towards that. I've seen it quite a bit, so I have it on my mind as an option. I guess people without personal experience of it wouldn't consider it.", "I understand being leery.

Asking to actually go inside someone else\u2019s home to make a call is sketchy AF.", "Well, unless she just moved in and hadn't memorized the code yet, I'd still be suspicious of her.

Someone kept putting a rock in the door opening over the weekend so I suspect they were expecting guests or just to lazy to remember a four digit code.", "I did not make a comment about whether to let them in.\n\nI made a comment about it being ridiculous to pretend you *know* that someone has bad intent just because they don\u2019t want to interact with anyone with a gun.", "The alternative is asking her what the number is & calling on your cell, on speaker, right there on the sidewalk", "CNN 3 days ago: 11-year-old boy shot in the chest by Mississippi police after calling 911 for help", "I was mostly making a joke about how this always goes wrong on the ten million police procedural that are on television.", "I think people did not really like my procedural joke.", "I have a few people in my family who had early onset dementia, and I thought the same thing. 60s might not be \"old old\" but it is, unfortunately, old enough for dementia to be a possibility.
