I was over the moon when I opened it. I've been wanting one for a while but I couldn't afford it.\n\nSo fast forward the next day: my aunt hands me note. I read it, and it's a list of rules and regulations that she wants me to follow while playing the Switch. According to her \"rules\", I have to give her daughter (who is also visiting) a certain amount of playtime each day whenever she's around, I have to keep the volume at a certain level, I can't play any games with violence or \"adult themes\" (which is basically just anything rated above E10+), and I'm not allowed to let anyone else play it without 'her permission'.\n\nThere was also one other rule: I had to enable parental controls so she could monitor my activity. \n\nTo give you some context, I see this aunt MAYBE twice a year. I understand that she's just trying to look out for me and make sure that I'm not playing inappropriate games, but I felt like she was treating me like a child and that her rules were a bit ridiculous. \n\nSo I decided to sell the switch online at a steep discount and use the money to buy a new one without any strings attached. My aunt found out and got pissed, saying I was ungrateful and that I \"should have thought about her feelings before I decided to do something so selfish\". My parents are also mad at me and say I should have just talked to her about it first.\n\nDid I do something wrong here?

Your parents should have shut her BS down and returned the \u201cgift\u201d (it wasn\u2019t a gift as gifts don\u2019t come with strings attached) and bought you a new one.

Now in the spirit of gift giving that is absolutely a rude thing to do. But c'mon, this is such an odd situation for a 17 year old to have to navigate. Your aunt is such an AH to put these kind of strings on a gift. I don't think you're an AH for how you decided to go about this but it definitely was not something I would have done. You would have been better off returning it to her. Sends a stronger message.", "~~ESH~~. \n\nNTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s place to monitor you like that unless your parents gave her permission to do it for some reason. \n\n~~You could\u2019ve just refused the gift and let her know you\u2019re not willing to follow the rules so you don\u2019t want the Switch. ~~\n\n~~You\u2019re 17, so you\u2019re old enough to work and get yourself a Switch if you want one. I wouldn\u2019t have tolerated her rules either but I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve sold it.~~\n\nEdit: I missed some context. Changed my vote. I\u2019ll leave my original comment text up and just put a strike through.", "NTA \n\nBut you went about it the wrong way. I feel like you jumped straight to the most drastic approach, when conversations and negotiations could have been had, having said that, a gift should just be a gift, and negotiations shouldn\u2019t be needed, but if you could have come to some sort of middle ground it could have been ok, and if you still weren\u2019t happy with the terms, or she was being too unreasonable, hand it back and say no thanks, and remember this moment, because it would have been an important memory for future you.", "You're NTA, but I don't see how selling it benefitted you at all. The only method to enforce compliance on the original switch was your parents using their authority to tell you what to do, which they still can with the resold switch. The \"rules\" around the Switch are social barriers contingent on your parents recognizing them, not legal barriers contingent on the name on the receipt.\n\nHell, if anything, this bizarre scheme is probably *more* likely to lead to your parents strictly monitoring your switch use than if you had simply ignored the rules in the first place", "ESH. Gifts with strings attached are pretty lousy gifts. However, you had two far better courses of action here. You could have 1) declined the gift based on the strings attached to it; 2) ignored the demands and put it in her and your parent's ballpark whether or not to take back the Switch. On a cosmic scale, how is this new Switch which you purchased using money given to you by your aunt different from the old Switch? You seem to be operating on a very literal level here and are ignoring the fact that because your aunt's money has gone into the new switch, her demands are still binding.
