I was over the moon when I opened it. I've been wanting one for a while but I couldn't afford it.\n\nSo fast forward the next day: my aunt hands me note. I read it, and it's a list of rules and regulations that she wants me to follow while playing the Switch. According to her \"rules\", I have to give her daughter (who is also visiting) a certain amount of playtime each day whenever she's around, I have to keep the volume at a certain level, I can't play any games with violence or \"adult themes\" (which is basically just anything rated above E10+), and I'm not allowed to let anyone else play it without 'her permission'.\n\nThere was also one other rule: I had to enable parental controls so she could monitor my activity. \n\nTo give you some context, I see this aunt MAYBE twice a year. I understand that she's just trying to look out for me and make sure that I'm not playing inappropriate games, but I felt like she was treating me like a child and that her rules were a bit ridiculous. \n\nSo I decided to sell the switch online at a steep discount and use the money to buy a new one without any strings attached. My aunt found out and got pissed, saying I was ungrateful and that I \"should have thought about her feelings before I decided to do something so selfish\". My parents are also mad at me and say I should have just talked to her about it first.\n\nDid I do something wrong here?

Now in the spirit of gift giving that is absolutely a rude thing to do. But c'mon, this is such an odd situation for a 17 year old to have to navigate. Your aunt is such an AH to put these kind of strings on a gift. I don't think you're an AH for how you decided to go about this but it definitely was not something I would have done. You would have been better off returning it to her. Sends a stronger message.", "~~ESH~~. \n\nNTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s place to monitor you like that unless your parents gave her permission to do it for some reason. \n\n~~You could\u2019ve just refused the gift and let her know you\u2019re not willing to follow the rules so you don\u2019t want the Switch. ~~\n\n~~You\u2019re 17, so you\u2019re old enough to work and get yourself a Switch if you want one. I wouldn\u2019t have tolerated her rules either but I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve sold it.~~\n\nEdit: I missed some context. Changed my vote. I\u2019ll leave my original comment text up and just put a strike through.", "NTA \n\nBut you went about it the wrong way. I feel like you jumped straight to the most drastic approach, when conversations and negotiations could have been had, having said that, a gift should just be a gift, and negotiations shouldn\u2019t be needed, but if you could have come to some sort of middle ground it could have been ok, and if you still weren\u2019t happy with the terms, or she was being too unreasonable, hand it back and say no thanks, and remember this moment, because it would have been an important memory for future you.", "You're NTA, but I don't see how selling it benefitted you at all. The only method to enforce compliance on the original switch was your parents using their authority to tell you what to do, which they still can with the resold switch. The \"rules\" around the Switch are social barriers contingent on your parents recognizing them, not legal barriers contingent on the name on the receipt.\n\nHell, if anything, this bizarre scheme is probably *more* likely to lead to your parents strictly monitoring your switch use than if you had simply ignored the rules in the first place", "ESH. Gifts with strings attached are pretty lousy gifts. However, you had two far better courses of action here. You could have 1) declined the gift based on the strings attached to it; 2) ignored the demands and put it in her and your parent's ballpark whether or not to take back the Switch. On a cosmic scale, how is this new Switch which you purchased using money given to you by your aunt different from the old Switch? You seem to be operating on a very literal level here and are ignoring the fact that because your aunt's money has gone into the new switch, her demands are still binding.

You do not get to parent my child, and if you attempt to take a gift from my children, you will never be involved with them. Period.", "With an aunt like that, the relationship would probably be ended either way...", "Oh what a terrible bridge to burn, someone who's trying to control you and infantilize you, and is very clearly setting up to make you a caretaker for their child whenever they come over. What a loss /s", "What's to stop the parents from taking away the one he bought after selling the one the aunt bought ? It's the same situation he's in the right but if his parents are dicks it won't matter.", "Partial comment stolen from u/Eldudeareno217 (love the name, btw)\n\nu/Randfkl is a bot.", "Even if it's not that's how I'll be saying it from now on.", " A true gift should come with no strings attached. She\u2019s being unreasonable.", "Someone who more or less wanted a private entertainment console for her daughter for when they visit OP's place instead of just getting the daughter a switch straight up.", "Good looking out...appreciate it.", "Omfg. You\u2019re awesome. Each child needs a parent like this", "She already gave him the Switch. He could have said no and kept it anyway.", "Yeah dunno what I was thinking lol. I guess I thought that since it's not the one that the aunt bought, the aunt has no legal right over it if she's trying to get it back. Ya know, since the receipts wouldn't match, she wouldn't have any proof as to him possessing or selling the one she bought for (her daughter) him. \n\nOP should invest in a safe and hide it, along with keeping the keys on them. Def don't tell your parents that you have a safe if they're trying to get the console back.", "that would go against her rules which would upset her. so either way shed be upset", "well the gift that op accepted was just the switch, the rules were added later. not even on the same day.", "I tend to pattern recognize, especially when the phrasing is so specific. Seems like there have been a ton of bots posting snippets of real comments to karma farm.", "Sounds like the parents are on the aunt's side, so it's fair to assume they'd take it away somehow. He's still a minor, so his parents can take his shit away. I totally agree with what OP did, tbc.", "Then why did they sell the Switch, if they felt the conditions provided by the aunt had nothing to do with the gift? Why not just ignore her conditions altogether? Or tell the aunt that he'd like to keep the Switch but only if there were no rules attached?\n\nIt's because OP saw the rules as conditions for accepting the gift even with the delay in receiving them. And if OP thinks it would have been wrong to keep the Switch and not follow the rules, why is it OK to sell the Switch to get around the rules?", "To be fair, if they're gonna take it away they're gonna take it away, a switch is a switch.", "because either way its his to do with as he pleased, he couldve kept the switch and ignored her rules and heard her be pissy abt how she bought it so he had to follow the rules or sell it and hear her be pissy abt how hes ungrateful for not accepting her gift with her rules.\n\nits his gift to do as he pleases, and its no longer from her.", "Yeah dunno what I was thinking lol. I guess I thought that since it's not the one that the aunt bought, the aunt has no legal right over it if she's trying to get it back. Ya know, since the receipts wouldn't match, she wouldn't have any proof as to him possessing or selling the one she bought for (her daughter) him.", "Except it is because the money he received from the sale is still from her gift. OP selling the gift doesn't magically mean his aunt never gave him a gift... \n\nAnd she is more than likely still going to be \"pissy\" about it, especially if she sees him playing on the new Switch he buys from the cash from her gift.\n\nPeople can defend OP if they want to - not talking to his aunt, who spent hundreds of dollars on this gift, and selling a gift for pennies on the dollar because he didn't like her conditions isn't proper etiquette to me. It doesn't even seem like OP said thank you for a gift that likely netted them at least $100.", "Well the aunt doesnt seem to take it that way as she hasnt made a fuss of that and instead said that op was ungrateful for her gift. it is stated he already bought a new one.\n\nand i already stated that shes gonna be pissy either way, but this way shes pissy without strings attached\n\nits also not proper etiquette to put strings attached to a gift, so neither are following niceties.\nits not good to play fire with fire, but its also okay to not show respect to someone who doesnt respect you, yknow?\n\ntheres time and places, and this is a time and place where its okay to give the same energy.\n\nif shes not gonna follow proper etiquette, op doesnt have to follow it either", "That isn't how proper etiquette works - you don't pick and choose who to apply it to. You act in a proper way towards everyone, whether they are \"worthy\" of it or not. \n\nAnd yes, I agree the aunt is wrong for adding conditions to her gift. Hence why my OP states ESH and says the aunt is TA for including them.", "Thats not how i was raised.\nyou apply things to those who deserve it, if you earned the right to be treated correctly, or treated me correctly then i shall treat you correctly, if not, ill just match energy or not associate with you at all.\n\nive seen alot of family get cut off as a kid to this day because of disrespect, some like this for giving gifts with strings attached, and those gifts were still kept and used as pleased, because at the end of the day its now someone elses property.\n\nim not arguing your judgement, i was just saying that op didnt accept a gift with strings attached, and hes also allowed to do what he wants with his gift"]}
