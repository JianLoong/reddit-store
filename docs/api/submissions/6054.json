I was over the moon when I opened it. I've been wanting one for a while but I couldn't afford it.\n\nSo fast forward the next day: my aunt hands me note. I read it, and it's a list of rules and regulations that she wants me to follow while playing the Switch. According to her \"rules\", I have to give her daughter (who is also visiting) a certain amount of playtime each day whenever she's around, I have to keep the volume at a certain level, I can't play any games with violence or \"adult themes\" (which is basically just anything rated above E10+), and I'm not allowed to let anyone else play it without 'her permission'.\n\nThere was also one other rule: I had to enable parental controls so she could monitor my activity. \n\nTo give you some context, I see this aunt MAYBE twice a year. I understand that she's just trying to look out for me and make sure that I'm not playing inappropriate games, but I felt like she was treating me like a child and that her rules were a bit ridiculous. \n\nSo I decided to sell the switch online at a steep discount and use the money to buy a new one without any strings attached. My aunt found out and got pissed, saying I was ungrateful and that I \"should have thought about her feelings before I decided to do something so selfish\". My parents are also mad at me and say I should have just talked to her about it first.\n\nDid I do something wrong here?

Now in the spirit of gift giving that is absolutely a rude thing to do. But c'mon, this is such an odd situation for a 17 year old to have to navigate. Your aunt is such an AH to put these kind of strings on a gift. I don't think you're an AH for how you decided to go about this but it definitely was not something I would have done. You would have been better off returning it to her.

I wouldn\u2019t have tolerated her rules either but I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve sold it.~~\n\nEdit: I missed some context. Changed my vote. I\u2019ll leave my original comment text up and just put a strike through.", "NTA \n\nBut you went about it the wrong way. I feel like you jumped straight to the most drastic approach, when conversations and negotiations could have been had, having said that, a gift should just be a gift, and negotiations shouldn\u2019t be needed, but if you could have come to some sort of middle ground it could have been ok, and if you still weren\u2019t happy with the terms, or she was being too unreasonable, hand it back and say no thanks, and remember this moment, because it would have been an important memory for future you.", "You're NTA, but I don't see how selling it benefitted you at all. The only method to enforce compliance on the original switch was your parents using their authority to tell you what to do, which they still can with the resold switch. The \"rules\" around the Switch are social barriers contingent on your parents recognizing them, not legal barriers contingent on the name on the receipt.\n\nHell, if anything, this bizarre scheme is probably *more* likely to lead to your parents strictly monitoring your switch use than if you had simply ignored the rules in the first place", "ESH. Gifts with strings attached are pretty lousy gifts. However, you had two far better courses of action here. You could have 1) declined the gift based on the strings attached to it; 2) ignored the demands and put it in her and your parent's ballpark whether or not to take back the Switch. On a cosmic scale, how is this new Switch which you purchased using money given to you by your aunt different from the old Switch? You seem to be operating on a very literal level here and are ignoring the fact that because your aunt's money has gone into the new switch, her demands are still binding.

You don't give people gifts with strings attached like that - especially saying you have to let her daughter use it - if it's yours then you aren't obligated to share it.  Also at 17 you're going to be a legal adult in a few months, so the bit about not being allowed to play games with violence or adult themes is ridiculous.  Your aunt sounds like a real piece of work.

First off, NTA, gonna say it right off the bat bc that's what I am hearing from this post.\n\n\n>I (M17) recently got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas from my aunt. I was over the moon when I opened it. I've been wanting one for a while but I couldn't afford it.\n\nOk awesome. You got a switch, congrats on that.\n\n>So fast forward the next day: my aunt hands me note. I read it, and it's a list of rules and regulations that she wants me to follow while playing the Switch. According to her \"rules\", I have to give her daughter (who is also visiting) a certain amount of playtime each day whenever she's around, I have to keep the volume at a certain level, I can't play any games with violence or \"adult themes\" (which is basically just anything rated above E10+), and I'm not allowed to let anyone else play it without 'her permission'.\n\n>There was also one other rule: I had to enable parental controls so she could monitor my activity. \n\nWell this is bullcrap outta her mouth. Why give a gift withs trings attatched? That isn't a gift, that is a form of control. You are old enough according to nintendo and ESRB, to play rated M games, which are 17+. Also you're also almost an adult, so clearly the aunt isn't thinking this through.\n\n>So I decided to sell the switch online at a steep discount and use the money to buy a new one without any strings attached. My aunt found out and got pissed, saying I was ungrateful and that I \"should have thought about her feelings before I decided to do something so selfish\".\n\nHere's what would've went down if you DID talk to them. Aunt finds out, parents take switch and hand back to aunt, so then you have no switch at all. Since the Aunt is this delusional with setting rules, it wouldn't be that far of a stretch to be angry you found a loophole, and telling your parents about it.\n\n>My parents are also mad at me and say I should have just talked to her about it first.\n\nBest guess is that the aunt told them about you selling the console to replace it, but never mentioned the rules at all. Since we aren't told that the parents were aware of the rules, then they weren't informed. The rules were technically given to only you and your parents didn't know shit about them, only you did in particular.\n\nSure it was drastic to sell the switch and buy a new one instead of handing it back, but she did give you the rules the DAY after you recieving it, instead of having the note right there and then on christmas, so clearly she's control hungry. All your parents are aware of is you got a switch for your aunt, and then went right around to sell it and buy a new one for pretty much no reason at all. But then again, there's also the possibility of them always caving in to the aunt's demands, so they were on her side, just because they just wanted peace to be kept.\n\nDunno, my hands are tied here. Most likely you're NTA, but you could've at least informed your parents on the rules, handing the note to them, since they are IN WRITING on some crumbly old post it note from aunt's to do magnet on her fridge.", "Why do people seem to think this is a clever solution?  They sold at a loss, and the aunt/parents could demand they give back the Switch since OP didn\u2019t accept the conditions.\n\nHopefully it doesn\u2019t come to that, but this clever solution could easily end up costing them money,", "NTA lmao well played. While one can see the concern that the aunt has in her own uniquely controlling way, what's up with the fixed hours for her daughter when she's visiting?

Who gives a gift to a 17yo and monitors him???", "I really like how clever that was. NTA", "Well, that's just it - the aunt and parents don't like young adults that \"think outside the box\". They like relatives that obey them.", "My guess is that was what aunt was relying on, so that she could act offended but still claim she got her nephew a gift.

It's better to be like \"I hate this\" and sell it/donate it instead of pretending to like it and let it absorb into the clutter of useless shit people got you that you hate.\n\nBesides, nobody likes having the gift they gave, returned back to them", "And would you have returned the gift at that point, or sell it?

The switch has a mobile app you can download for parental controls that would allow her to monitor his playtime, what games OP plays, etc...all from her phone.\n\nFrom that app, she would also have the ability to set playtime limits for whatever she would like, and once that limit is reached the console will automatically enter sleep mode.\n\nBasically, she can decide to cut his time to the minimum if he does something she wouldn't like, borderline bricking the thing.\n\nSo no, that was an underhanded attempt to control a 17 year-old she wasn't the parent of from a long distance.", "How would the person who bought the Switch from him remove said controls?", "This is mostly theory, but it sounds likely that OP got rid of it before parental controls were even set. It doesn't seem like OP had controls before Aunt demanded they be on there, and if it was at a steep discount you would be shocked at how quickly it would sell. Switches are always in high demand around Christmas.\n\nOP could've even sold it to a friend same-day, especially with them just getting christmas money.", "For me it has more to do with \"converting\" the gift.\n\nHe sold it at a discount, converted the gift into cash. Top up with hid own cash and bought one with no strings attached. Aunt has no so called \"moral\" grounds to enforce the conditions on the new switch given that it was not the one she gifted.", "Just hide the Switch  whenever your Aunt comes over or put a password on it so she can't ever have control.", " NTA- if it\u2019s given as a gift. The gifter then cannot set out rules that you have to follow. That\u2019s not how it goes! However I think it\u2019s great you sold the strings attached to switch and got another \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, and your aunt sounds horrible. There\u2019s one rule of gift-giving\u2026 once you give a gift to someone, you no longer have a say in what they do with that gift. Period. Well played!", "NTA and well played", "NTA- What the fuck who buys someone a gift and attaches rules with it?", "My parents tend to take her side in a lot of things. My mother said that I should be \"appreciative that she even gave it to me\" and that if I didn't have it I'd be without any kind of entertainment, which isn't true because I have a laptop and smartphone that I play games on.", "This is absolutely the classy way to handle it. A Nintendo Switch is only $300, so a reasonable amount for a 17-year old with a part time job to save up for and buy on their own.", "True true.", "Hubby got a really good deal on just the console no dock no joycons on ebay, we had 4 joycons already. About 1/3 the cost of a new oled. Then you could dock the og and use it exclusively as a regular console and use the oled as your daily driver. I wouldn't let him drop $$ on a separate switch package when we already had all the accessories. I was WRONG. We need a second dock for our older daughter, she keeps hogging the main TV \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You can choose whether or not to enable the parental controls on a new device when you set it up the first time.", "I had assumed the Aunt had set parental controls already, if not then just tell Aunt you sold it, and don't sell it. But if parental controls have been set then the second owner would still have them.", "I wonder if some of those rules are because the Aunt\u2019s daughter is supposed to be using it too. No info on her age (not that that might matter to her mother). But I could see her wanting to control what might be on something her daughter uses, and even anything that would be used around her daughter (lest her daughter get ideas).", "My thinking exactly", "Yeah I also though that it sounded like this was cousins switch that op was given to hold on to so cousin could have something to play during visits \nThat or she doesn\u2019t want to buy the cousin a switch so she buys op one to look like a good aunt", "I mean it has games like saints row 3&4 and every doom and the gta collection\nIt has lots of games rated m or close to m that you can\u2019t access if your account is under a certain age (under 17 I think) based on the birthday set", "Still pretty silly.\n\nHe did all that without trying another way like discussing with his parents about rhe rules, proposing that the parental control is given to them (I guess they wouldnt really enforce it).. etc.  \n\nHe immediately went for the solution that would both create drama and waste money.", "It's a switch, though. Are there any \"inappropriate\" games even available?", "I'm sure OP's aunt would take offense to games like Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, or Doom. Then again for all we know she's the kind of person who finds Harry Potter offensive.", "Depending on how much he managed to get for it, I\u2019d cover the difference because that\u2019s fucking hilarious.", "Yeah, even then, the gift was for the 17-year-old who said in comments or edit that he sees her maybe 1 or 2xs a year. It's not like the daughter visits weekly, monthly, etc. If that is the case, then buy your daughter the switch and let the adults know what she can and can not play when visiting a couple of times a year.", "I think some of these could be tweaked slightly into more reasonable requests:\n\n* If they're there, either put it away/play in private\n\n* or consider sharing it, mute it or wear headphones, and keep anything violent away from his cousin.\n\ni.e. please be considerate when we visit", "Legally ianal but I don't think it is bc of the timing. Aunt gave the gift to op on the 25th, no mention of any kind of agreement or reciprocal obligation, switch now belongs to op. The next day, aunt hits op with a list of demands, but *offers no additional consideration,* she can't tie her demands to the switch cause it's no longer hers. That's not a contract it's just a demand from someone with zero legal standing to enforce any kind of claim to the switch or to op obeying her commands\n\nIf she'd told him on Christmas day before the gift exchange \"I'll give you a switch if you agree to XYZ conditions,\" then each party would be giving consideration to the other in exchange for receiving consideration. That's a contract\n\nNote: consideration is the legal term for something of value. Eg money, services/labor, property, etc."]}
