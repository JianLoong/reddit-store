I was over the moon when I opened it. I've been wanting one for a while but I couldn't afford it.\n\nSo fast forward the next day: my aunt hands me note. I read it, and it's a list of rules and regulations that she wants me to follow while playing the Switch. According to her \"rules\", I have to give her daughter (who is also visiting) a certain amount of playtime each day whenever she's around, I have to keep the volume at a certain level, I can't play any games with violence or \"adult themes\" (which is basically just anything rated above E10+), and I'm not allowed to let anyone else play it without 'her permission'.\n\nThere was also one other rule: I had to enable parental controls so she could monitor my activity. \n\nTo give you some context, I see this aunt MAYBE twice a year. I understand that she's just trying to look out for me and make sure that I'm not playing inappropriate games, but I felt like she was treating me like a child and that her rules were a bit ridiculous. \n\nSo I decided to sell the switch online at a steep discount and use the money to buy a new one without any strings attached. My aunt found out and got pissed, saying I was ungrateful and that I \"should have thought about her feelings before I decided to do something so selfish\". My parents are also mad at me and say I should have just talked to her about it first.\n\nDid I do something wrong here? AITA?", "created_utc": 1672446858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzggx1/aita_for_selling_the_nintendo_switch_my_aunt_got/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should be protecting you from her behavior.\n\nAny gift given means you can do with it what you want.", "NTA - you are 17, not 7. Gifts with strings aren't gifts. If you were MY kid, I'd be patting you on the back for thinking outside of the box and finding a solution to her 'rules'. Good job!", "NTA.  She didn't give you a gift.  She gave you a contract/obligation/responsibility.  \n\nBetter, I think, would be to have read the rules, politely said \"no thank you\", and handed it back.  But the money *is* nice!", "Good Lord! You are definitely NTA, but your aunt surely is. You're basically an adult, but you're supposed to give her parental controls over you? No way. That's not a gift. It's a creepy overstepping of all kinds of boundaries. Ew.", "NTA. Your aunt didn\u2019t institute rules because \u201cshe\u2019s just trying to look out for\u201c you. She did it to control you. You are almost an adult and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that your aunt is behaving like this. Your parents should have shut her BS down and returned the \u201cgift\u201d (it wasn\u2019t a gift as gifts don\u2019t come with strings attached) and bought you a new one. You managed a creative solution to an unusual situation. Good job protecting your boundaries.", "Absolutely NTA. Why is she trying to police your use of the gift? A true gift should come with no strings attached. She\u2019s being unreasonable", "The aunt is TA. You can\u2019t control a present after it\u2019s been given. You can\u2019t buy control over someone else\u2019s child for 200 freaking bucks. Tell her to XXXX off.", "NTA. Monitor my gaming? Heck no lol. Out of curiosity, did your parents know about this? The extra conditions that is", "NTA. First off, you're 17. Not 11. Secondly, she is not your parent, so this is not her call. \n\nProps for finding a loophole \ud83d\ude06", "This would have been absurd if you were 14, it's absolutely ridiculous placing  these restrictions 17 year old. My thing is I would have just said\" No, I'm good dwag. I'll play my switch anyway i want\" A gift is a gift and once it is in your possession, it's yours. \nNTA. I do hope you use the money that you received and maybe add a few more dollars to buy yourself your own switch.", "NTA you're almost an adult, you decide what you want to play.  Gifts shouldn't have strings attached and her rules are beyond ridiculous. It's actually insane that she thought that was OK.", "NTA. Genuine gifts don\u2019t come with strings attached.", "NTA - Extremely weird of her to try to put such strict restrictions on her almost adult nephew that she barely even sees. I wouldn\u2019t accept any gifts from her again.", "Your aunt has some ridiculous conditions tied to her gift and you\u2019re almost an adult anyways; NTA.", "NTA it became your Switch to do as you wish.", "Nta. You\u2019re 17 not 7. She\u2019s treating you like a child", "NTA - Your parents should have had your back on this from the start. \n\nYour aunt sounds like a fun person. Be glad you're not getting anymore \"gifts\" from her. \n\nHave fun gaming. I highly suggest playing Breath of the Wild.", "NTA.\n\nShe was *way* overstepping her boundaries. You *have* parents to raise you, you don't need her doing this. You're 17. And she can buy her own damn daughter a Switch instead of having her mooch off of yours. It's not even her house! Plus, it was supposedly a gift, right? So it's yours to do with as you please now, to hell with the attached strings. And if it wasn't really a gift, she shouldn't have gotten it for you for Christmas.\n\nPretty clever workaround, though.", "Nta, the sharing is alright for 2 times a year, but everything else is bs, glad you didnt lower yourself to her , and hey, you ende dup buying it yourself so its something you bought lol", "NTA. Just be thankful she's your aunt rather than one of your parents.", "NTA: what was the point of her doing that?", "NTA. Why your aunt would need to monitor your Switch and implement rules? Especially someone who sees you twice a year? I would have probably suggested giving it back to her with a \"thanks but no thanks\" but it is what it is. A gift with strings isn't a gift at all.", "Info - Instead of selling it at a steep loss, and buying a new one, why not tell your family that you sold it and are buying a new one. This would have been less work and saved you money.", "I would understand your aunt's rules if you were 10 years younger than you are. You're almost an adult, these rules are absolutely ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI would have kept it. And downloaded A LOT of porn...under a folder with her name on it", "NTA. Your aunt sounds utterly ridiculous.", "NTA. Gifts shouldn\u2019t be given with conditions and rules.", "You\u2019re too old for that kind of helicoptering. NTA.", "NTA.  This was a way of giving her own daughter a gift and also getting credit for getting you one.", "Hahaha, I would've personally given it back and said, \"I'll take money instead.\" Or at least talked to her before I did it. \n\nDon't know if I'd call you an AH though, and I think it was well done. So I may not be the best judge but NTA.", "NTA. However, I wouldn\u2019t have sold it. I would just have said \u201cno\u201d to the conditions & kept the original switch. Once she gave it to you, it\u2019s yours to do what you want.  If I were your parent, I would have shut the aunt down on the spot. For one thing, I\u2019m the parent; I\u2019ll make the rules for my kid & my house. For another, you\u2019re 17 not 7, & these rules are ridiculous.", "NTA but your response is weirdly complicated she already gave you the gift it was already yours why not just say \"no\" to her rules.", "NTA this is hilarious", "NTA, I think..\n\nThis is interesting because imo if you take the aunt's stipulations out of it, what OP essentially did was get a gift for Xmas and sell it to get something else. Now in the spirit of gift giving that is absolutely a rude thing to do. But c'mon, this is such an odd situation for a 17 year old to have to navigate. Your aunt is such an AH to put these kind of strings on a gift. I don't think you're an AH for how you decided to go about this but it definitely was not something I would have done. You would have been better off returning it to her. Sends a stronger message.", "~~ESH~~. \n\nNTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your aunt\u2019s place to monitor you like that unless your parents gave her permission to do it for some reason. \n\n~~You could\u2019ve just refused the gift and let her know you\u2019re not willing to follow the rules so you don\u2019t want the Switch. ~~\n\n~~You\u2019re 17, so you\u2019re old enough to work and get yourself a Switch if you want one. I wouldn\u2019t have tolerated her rules either but I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve sold it.~~\n\nEdit: I missed some context. Changed my vote. I\u2019ll leave my original comment text up and just put a strike through.", "NTA \n\nBut you went about it the wrong way. I feel like you jumped straight to the most drastic approach, when conversations and negotiations could have been had, having said that, a gift should just be a gift, and negotiations shouldn\u2019t be needed, but if you could have come to some sort of middle ground it could have been ok, and if you still weren\u2019t happy with the terms, or she was being too unreasonable, hand it back and say no thanks, and remember this moment, because it would have been an important memory for future you.", "You're NTA, but I don't see how selling it benefitted you at all. The only method to enforce compliance on the original switch was your parents using their authority to tell you what to do, which they still can with the resold switch. The \"rules\" around the Switch are social barriers contingent on your parents recognizing them, not legal barriers contingent on the name on the receipt.\n\nHell, if anything, this bizarre scheme is probably *more* likely to lead to your parents strictly monitoring your switch use than if you had simply ignored the rules in the first place", "ESH. Gifts with strings attached are pretty lousy gifts. However, you had two far better courses of action here. You could have 1) declined the gift based on the strings attached to it; 2) ignored the demands and put it in her and your parent's ballpark whether or not to take back the Switch. On a cosmic scale, how is this new Switch which you purchased using money given to you by your aunt different from the old Switch? You seem to be operating on a very literal level here and are ignoring the fact that because your aunt's money has gone into the new switch, her demands are still binding. You are really in the same situation but you've made it more complicated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
