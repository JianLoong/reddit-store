She always made sure to do it whenever I was alone or where nobody could see. It was frustrating because my brother took it to mean I didn\u2019t like her as she had a very different public persona. I don\u2019t blame him for this but I did decide to document everything as at the time I was too scared to show anybody. However I photographed her text exchanges and started recording her. I waited specifically until an important family gathering and after years of her bullying, I exposed it to everybody. She couldn\u2019t deny it. Broke down in tears trying to say that she \u2018didn\u2019t mean it\u2019 and was \u2018sorry\u2019 and she \u2018didn\u2019t know why I did it.\u2019\n\nThe whole family was mad and my brother threatened divorce unless she agreed to therapy and marriage counselling. She went to intense therapy to work out her issues and tried to make amends but I don\u2019t care. She was in my words a horrible spiteful bitch and I distanced myself from everyone.\n\nWith Christmas coming up, everyone wants me there bur SIL will be there too. My parents are asking if I\u2019ll forgive SIL as it seems like therapy has worked and is making an effort to seek solid redemption for her actions. I said I don\u2019t care if she changed, it\u2019s the fact that she offered pathetic excuses for her behaviour and has barely tried to make amends. She\u2019s reached  out 5 times literally saying she was sorry and that\u2019s it. Any other \u2018redemption\u2019 has been through family members. It feels like my family have actually taken HER side as opposed to mine which hurts.\n\nMy brother has done a lot of couples counselling with her but hates how my parents are trying to force me to forgive her. Even he doesn\u2019t forgive her. I don\u2019t blame him for wanting to work on his marriage though as they have kids. He\u2019s the only one really on my side\n\nBasically I\u2019m the social pariah who is refusing to forgive SIL who made a \u2018mistake\u2019. I\u2019ve said if that\u2019s how I\u2019m\nSeem fine I won\u2019t be coming to Christmas. Brother has actually threatened the same saying the kids and SIL can go and he\u2019ll just spend it with me. Now I\u2019m the AH who is ruining Christmas.\n\nETA: I can\u2019t mention explicit details but it was so bad I lost almost 2 stone in weight. I wasn\u2019t eating. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was always stressed and on edge.\n\nETA 2: the reveal only happened over a year ago. She started therapy not long after but in reality she went for several months and has stopped it completely. Her reaching out to me has been really half assed so it doesn\u2019t seem genuine to me. Family members seem to think she\u2019s completely cured after this, but my brother is not convinced at all. Idk if they\u2019re still in marriage counselling but their marriage is still shaky. Basically each text was along the lines of \u2018Im sorry. Please forgive me.\u2019 She did not explain what issues she was working through. She did not offer more than a half assed apology and that\u2019s it. She appears more apologetic to the family, not me. I got the same text 5 times whereas she was seen as grovelling and begging my family\u2019s forgiveness but this has never happened to me.\n\nETA 3: I did try to give her the benefit of the doubt when she texted me the first time. I attempted to explain how she made me feel and why I was so angry and didn\u2019t want to forgive her, but I got radio silence. Basically, she ghosted me. Then, she would text a while later telling me the same thing and she just wouldn\u2019t hear what I was trying to say.\n\nETA 4; bar my brother, my whole family are keen to sweep this under the rug. It feels like they\u2019re favouring her and minimising my experiences. So no it\u2019s not as simple as that SIL is trying and that I should forgive her, it\u2019s literally like the whole ordeal is trying to be forgotten and my brother and I are the only ones not doing that.\n\nETA 5: for context I\u2019m 27F, my brother is 35M and SIL is 36. Their 2 kids are my nephews who are 15 and 12. They don\u2019t really know the whole truth to this situation as they\u2019ve been shielded from it.", "created_utc": 1670421959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf1xqd/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_sil_after_shes/", "score": 793, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given how hard you had to work to get your family to even see what was going on, they have some ground to cover here too and they are doing their case no good by acting like a bunch of flying monkeys and enabling SILs less than meaningful change of heart.

But as the principle victim of her behavior your feelings and perspective are probably the most dialed in. If anyone needs to miss Christmas, its her, not you.

That's not someone who's changed. That is a manipulative and very troubled person exploiting the situation in her favor. \n\nYour parents are AHs for expecting you to forgive years of bullying in a matter of months, and for pinning the tense family dynamic on you. \n\nI think the fact your brother is the only one supporting you is quite telling.

It\u2019s your decision. However, she also shouldn\u2019t be causing you to lose out at family gatherings, she just isn\u2019t important. If it would be easy to leave than I say try and just make sure you are never alone with her. If she tries to follow you into the kitchen or towards the bathroom just stop and turn around and tell your brother to keep her away from you.

OP, did your SIL ever give an explanation for her detestable behavior?

You have no obligation to be around someone who has hurt you so badly that you can\u2019t trust them not to start up again later. She will just be more subtle next time \n\nShe hasn\u2019t explained why she did it, why it won\u2019t happen again or shown any empathy for your feelings. It\u2019s just a forced, hollow non-apology which means nothing", "The only reason I would show up would be to continue gathering evidence that she hasn't changed like you did before. I'm not gonna lie, I tend to hold a grudge, so I definitely wouldn't be keen on \"forgiving\" her either. Best I'd be able to do is show up and avoid her like the plague, pretending she doesn't exist. NTA", "NTA. Your sister-in-law hasn't changed. At least she hasn't demonstrated to you that she has changes. Her apologies are insincere and incomplete. If she texts you \"I'm sorry\" again, text back \"Say more.\"  Go to Hawaii with your brother.", "NTA. I am in a bit of a similar situation. Family always seems to want conflicts to go away as quickly as possible, regardless of whether they are actually resolved or (more often) simply swept under the rug. They are siding with your SIL because they see it as the fastest way to a resolution that means they can get back to their illusion of a happy, cohesive family. Bravo to your brother. And as far as your SIL goes- the best advice I ever received has been: \"A leopard never changes its spots.\"", "\\>She went to intense therapy to work out her issues \n\nAnd there you have why therapy is almost always a complete waste of time, serving only to make assholes feel like justified assholes. Your sister had no need to \"work out her issues\" - all she had to do was stop behaving like a shit. You are NTA.", "Agree. Op isn't ruining Christmas, the SIL and OPs family are. They seem to be sweeping this under the rug for their own comfort and convenience. Plus, they didn't believe OP in the first place!", "Honestly it seems the family isn't interested in caring or believing. I'd wager this isn't the first time OPs feelings haven't mattered to them.\n\nThe fact the marriage is still on the rocks speaks volumes as to her level of \"progress\".", "I agree, I believe that she has NOT changed. She has cried to your family that \"she's tried and tried, and is just heartbroken that you're being so cold and heartless (insert crocodile tears)\" and now OP's family is hoping just to make the drama stop and expecting OP to do it.\n\nIn OP's place, I would not ever be at a gathering with SIL again, I wouldn't want her to have ANY chance of getting me alone.\n\nIt is very telling that OP's brother believes her and does not expect her to forgive SIL or be in the same place with her. Either she is just as nasty at home, or in therapy, he heard some stuff and now wants to protect his sister.\n\nOP, celebrate Christmas with your brother.  Maybe if you both are missing from a few family gatherings, they'll start to realize what a big problem SIL is.", "Well said!!\n\nNTA\n\nInfo: can you go to xmas and just not talk to her? everyone has that one relative they don't like, so just be the ones who agree to not like each other. I do agree what your family needs to mind their business and let you decide how you want to handle it.", "Well said.", "Sorry, but do you mean \"perfunctory\"?", "And the family is now bullying her to accept the half-arsed apology of her abuser.", "That's a good question, except for the \"bipolar\" bit. Maybe you meant \"borderline\"? Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder.", "Well, my work does shut down for 2 weeks and I think I could afford a getaway. Maybe that\u2019s not a bad idea. Maybe my brother might want to come.", "I am sorry, but no. No, no and no. SIL hurt OP in various ways and it could have ended horribly. OP could have taken her life because of it, or she could have died from complications associated with the weight she lost because of the bullying. Why do she needs to forgive SIL? To be the 'bigger person' in a situation where she was literally abused? To 'overcome her emotions' in a situations that will likely take *years* in therapy to get through? **OP is NTA.** She doesn't have to forgive SIL. Period.", "Ok and..... She still doesn't have to forgive her your prob the type to do the same thing her sil did aren't you?", "Exactly! OP shouldn't be required to spend Christmas with people who don't empathize with her experiences, who are siding with someone who hurt her.", "Wow.  This behavior does not change.  The real  question is who is her new victim?  Please tell me it isn't one of her kids.  It wouldn't surprise me if it was.  I would almost go but only because you fear that he is bullying her kids like she uses to bully you and tell everyone exactly that.  Tell them you are looking for signs of abuse in the kids from your SIL.", "I am deeply concerned for your brother's children. Please suggest that they attend family counseling. It's highly likely that she has simply moved on to another target (or always had several targets).", "Why are we even talking about forgiveness to your SIL? What has your immediate family done to earn your forgiveness for not believing you even as you physically deteriorated in front of their eyes?", "So she\u2019s a narcissist.  Like they do, they put up an image for everyone else.  But there lazy about it over time.  Your brother knows this.  The only thing to do about a narcissist is to stay away from them.  They have no regret and anything you say will only be used against you.", "She's still bullying you, just using differen methods. Acting like the victim that \"poor her\" won't get forgiven by hateful you. Using the family to once again make you the scapegoat. Remorse doesn't look like a guilt trip.", "I don\u2019t understand how anyone could let someone\u2019a actions affect them so badly, please do not take this as an attack I am simply stating how I can\u2019t fathom the idea I am sorry for what you went through", "You are NTA and I'm so sorry that this has happened to you.  It's great that your brother is supporting you, because he obviously knows his wife better than anyone and he knows that she hasn't changed and isn't remorseful.\n\nHas she ever given an explanation of why she treated you this way?  Are there other people that she has done this to?", "126 lbs to 98 lbs? Anyone not seeing this as a serious impact is TA. OP is NTA.\n\nSIL\u2019s behavior is abhorrent and her \u201capology\u201d does not sound at all genuine.", "Because chances are high she's awful to other people in your brother's life or to your brother. He knows her and honestly I would follow his lead here", "It\u2019s because he lived with her so he knows how horrible she could be. Everyone would rather pretend nothing happened.", "He\u2019s probably terrified for his children. Imagine having no real way out. She\u2019ll get custody or child visitation and could direct her hate towards them without supervision. He\u2019s married to someone he doesn\u2019t really know and has to sit there wondering and thinking about it while knowing what she did to you happened while she smiled and loved him.", "That's what people like her do, they show themselves as good persons who wouldn't kill a fly but in reality they're evil. She would never change because she don't want to, she went to therapy just gain sympathy and she's definitely not sorry.\n\nI bet the marriage not going to last, the kids and your brother deserve better just like you. \n\nI hope things are better now, take care of yourself.", "It is a performative action which is carried out without interest or effort.", "Nobody ever has to do something that they don't want to do.", "Nobody has to forgive anyone that they don't want to forgive.  How many times does it have to be said?", "Maybe you should ask why they prefer your SIL to their own daughter? By pushing this, they are continuing the bullying.", "NTA. Also \u201cforgiveness is yours to give, not others\u2019 to demand\u201d is a beautiful sentence.", "THIS. The man who knows her the best doesn't buy her \"redemption arc.\" Everyone wants OP to make peace because her pain is inconvenient. They don't care if she hurts for the rest of her life as long as she shuts up about it. Their indifference is cruel. Their relentless badgering for OP to \"forgive\" is a form of bullying too.\n\nOP needs to reconsider her relationship with these people.", "No one is required to accept an apology regardless of its veracity just as they aren\u2019t required to accept an amends, which she hasn\u2019t done anyway.  Not sure what an amends would look like her other than a public announcement explaining what she did, acknowledging how it impacted OP (without being promoted) and never doing it again.  Although OP wouldn\u2019t be there to see/hear it she still owes it and if I were OP I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near such a cruel person, frankly if she really feels bad she should be the one who stays home to allow OP the chance to spend time with her own family.", "And warn your brother - people like your SIL always need a scapegoat, a dog to kick. Now you\u2019re no longer in that role, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s turned on one of the kids (and keeping it just as secret as she did with you).", "When someone that you can't avoid or easily go NC targets you for abuse it can absolutely wear you down over time. \n\nInstead of asking OP, for whom this situation is very raw and personal, please seek out media that goes into the very real impact that emotional abuse has on a person to develop your understanding and empathy. There's fiction and nonfiction sources available.", "Or their children.", "My thoughts, too. He's probably seen more of her true personality than anyone else besides OP.   \n\n\nOP, you are NTA for refusing to be in the room with someone who was so awful to you.", "I think they don't want to believe it because then they'd have to confront the fact that they were complicit in rug-sweeping for years.\n\nAbusers groom the people around them to support them in the same way they manipulate their victims.", "Yes. You mean perfunctory.", "Your must be so fun to be around you are so annoying lol take your historical figures and shove them", ">Because if you don't you will be harming yourself\n\nThat is the only thing I agree with.  Otherwise all you're saying is that because some famous people laid down some quotable statements, OP has to forgive her SIL or else she's an asshole.  No one is an asshole for not choosing to follow soundbytes by famous people.  \"champions of peace\" don't know anything and also were not issuing orders, they were giving advice. Advice OP is not TA if she chooses not to blindly follow.\n\nIf she chooses to forgive her SIL, she can, for herself. But she is not required to be in her company ever again.  You can forgive someone without trusting they won't hurt you again. You never have to do anything to keep the peace in the family or to avoid them feeling uncomfortable.", "So. Y'all think otherwise?  You think offering an opinion is a demand for agreement.  Childish nonsense.", "She shouldn't  be forced to ignore her bully or have her parents be mad at her for not enduring it.", "They're afraid SIL will cut off access to the kids.  That's what it boils down to.", "Op isn't ruining Christmas, the SIL and OPs family are. They seem to be sweeping this under the rug for their own comfort and convenience.", "THIS.\n\nMy mom's mom was like this SIL, and they ALWAYS victimize at least one of their children, then treat the others well, so they can gaslight the victim into seeming like a crazy person for not liking them.", "I\u2019m curious about what faith you belong to, if you don\u2019t mind sharing?", "Maybe her family could use therapy, too.", "Interesting viewpoint.  So, you mean that a mistake makes everything you do wrong?  What about Jesus Christ?  He preached the value of forgiveness all of his life.  The same with Buddha, Confucius, Muhammad.   Are all of these historical figures wrong?   Should not their opinions be considered.  Every person makes their own choice.", "Nobody has to do anything that they don't want to do.", "No original idea.", "Never said has to!  Nobody ever said required!  Nobody said anything about keeping to peace in the family!  Do you really think that your thoughts get more consideration if you make up justification?", "Who told anyone to do anything?  I offered my opinion.  I said nothing about what she should do.  I don't care what she decides.  That's totally up to her.  Later in her life she will regret her decision if she doesn't.  That's my point.  It's an extremely important decision that she must make intellectually if she is going to put this behind her.  Everyone that disagrees on this is making emotional considerations the most important part of the decision.  Using the words of important historical figures seems to be rejected by the group.  The failure to give appropriate consideration to the values expressed by important historical figures just means that lessons are being missed.   History is a required subject in school.  The reason for it is obvious.  Do we stop considering history when we are done with school.   If she chooses to continue to hate this person she becomes an asshole to herself.  She is the only one that she is harming.   I hope that she figures it out for herself, but I don't care what her decision is.", "These are \"historical\" figures you should take with a grain of salt. You throwing your beliefs at someone doesn't make you right and them wrong.", "Nah there opinions shouldn't considered", "There is no right and wrong in an opinion.  To think otherwise is simply a revelation of feelings of insecurity.  IMO my opinion has the same value as yours.  Presenting my opinion is not throwing it around because I don't care what you decide.  I only care that I get the same hearing as everyone else.  It's not advancing an argument when you use accusations that have nothing to do with the conversation.", "Small minds work in mysterious ways. :-)", "No original thought.  Denial of a personal attack is unbecoming of an adult.", "There are definitely right and wrong opinions on certain topics.", "Seems like people agree with me, though. So where do we go from here?", "And who elected you to decide?  Who among us is qualified to decide who is right and wrong?   Everyone is entitled to agree or disagree, but no one is entitled to decide right or wrong.   Right or wrong is for children.  Agree or disagree is for adults.", "We have a non-personal exchange of ideas.  If you can't do that you don't belong in this community.  The conversation is about ideas.  It's not about being right or wrong.  Too many people seek agreement in this community.  I don't care if you agree with me or not.  I only care that I get the same consideration and freedom to express my ideas the same as everyone else.", "You have the same consideration and freedom to express your ideas. This particular idea just sucked. YTA.\n\nNext."]}
