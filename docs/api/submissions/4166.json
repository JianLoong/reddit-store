She always made sure to do it whenever I was alone or where nobody could see. It was frustrating because my brother took it to mean I didn\u2019t like her as she had a very different public persona. I don\u2019t blame him for this but I did decide to document everything as at the time I was too scared to show anybody. However I photographed her text exchanges and started recording her. I waited specifically until an important family gathering and after years of her bullying, I exposed it to everybody. She couldn\u2019t deny it. Broke down in tears trying to say that she \u2018didn\u2019t mean it\u2019 and was \u2018sorry\u2019 and she \u2018didn\u2019t know why I did it.\u2019\n\nThe whole family was mad and my brother threatened divorce unless she agreed to therapy and marriage counselling. She went to intense therapy to work out her issues and tried to make amends but I don\u2019t care. She was in my words a horrible spiteful bitch and I distanced myself from everyone.\n\nWith Christmas coming up, everyone wants me there bur SIL will be there too. My parents are asking if I\u2019ll forgive SIL as it seems like therapy has worked and is making an effort to seek solid redemption for her actions. I said I don\u2019t care if she changed, it\u2019s the fact that she offered pathetic excuses for her behaviour and has barely tried to make amends. She\u2019s reached  out 5 times literally saying she was sorry and that\u2019s it. Any other \u2018redemption\u2019 has been through family members. It feels like my family have actually taken HER side as opposed to mine which hurts.\n\nMy brother has done a lot of couples counselling with her but hates how my parents are trying to force me to forgive her. Even he doesn\u2019t forgive her. I don\u2019t blame him for wanting to work on his marriage though as they have kids. He\u2019s the only one really on my side\n\nBasically I\u2019m the social pariah who is refusing to forgive SIL who made a \u2018mistake\u2019. I\u2019ve said if that\u2019s how I\u2019m\nSeem fine I won\u2019t be coming to Christmas. Brother has actually threatened the same saying the kids and SIL can go and he\u2019ll just spend it with me. Now I\u2019m the AH who is ruining Christmas.\n\nETA: I can\u2019t mention explicit details but it was so bad I lost almost 2 stone in weight. I wasn\u2019t eating. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was always stressed and on edge.\n\nETA 2: the reveal only happened over a year ago. She started therapy not long after but in reality she went for several months and has stopped it completely. Her reaching out to me has been really half assed so it doesn\u2019t seem genuine to me. Family members seem to think she\u2019s completely cured after this, but my brother is not convinced at all. Idk if they\u2019re still in marriage counselling but their marriage is still shaky. Basically each text was along the lines of \u2018Im sorry. Please forgive me.\u2019 She did not explain what issues she was working through. She did not offer more than a half assed apology and that\u2019s it. She appears more apologetic to the family, not me. I got the same text 5 times whereas she was seen as grovelling and begging my family\u2019s forgiveness but this has never happened to me.\n\nETA 3: I did try to give her the benefit of the doubt when she texted me the first time. I attempted to explain how she made me feel and why I was so angry and didn\u2019t want to forgive her, but I got radio silence. Basically, she ghosted me. Then, she would text a while later telling me the same thing and she just wouldn\u2019t hear what I was trying to say.\n\nETA 4; bar my brother, my whole family are keen to sweep this under the rug. It feels like they\u2019re favouring her and minimising my experiences. So no it\u2019s not as simple as that SIL is trying and that I should forgive her, it\u2019s literally like the whole ordeal is trying to be forgotten and my brother and I are the only ones not doing that.\n\nETA 5: for context I\u2019m 27F, my brother is 35M and SIL is 36. Their 2 kids are my nephews who are 15 and 12. They don\u2019t really know the whole truth to this situation as they\u2019ve been shielded from it.", "created_utc": 1670421959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf1xqd/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_sil_after_shes/", "score": 2239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given how hard you had to work to get your family to even see what was going on, they have some ground to cover here too and they are doing their case no good by acting like a bunch of flying monkeys and enabling SILs less than meaningful change of heart.

Is there a friends house you can go to or something fun you can do for the day?", "Honest change and sincere efforts at redemption deserve forgiveness. Half hearted ones don't. Therapy is a process and no one gets better overnight, and its helpful to get positive feedback on ones efforts. But as the principle victim of her behavior your feelings and perspective are probably the most dialed in. If anyone needs to miss Christmas, its her, not you.

How much can she have changed, really?", "NTA.  \nTypical story of parents disregarding very real trauma and issues so they can pretend to stand by family values when they have a full happy family Christmas.

That's not someone who's changed. That is a manipulative and very troubled person exploiting the situation in her favor. \n\nYour parents are AHs for expecting you to forgive years of bullying in a matter of months, and for pinning the tense family dynamic on you. \n\nI think the fact your brother is the only one supporting you is quite telling.

It\u2019s your decision. However, she also shouldn\u2019t be causing you to lose out at family gatherings, she just isn\u2019t important. If it would be easy to leave than I say try and just make sure you are never alone with her. If she tries to follow you into the kitchen or towards the bathroom just stop and turn around and tell your brother to keep her away from you.

OP, did your SIL ever give an explanation for her detestable behavior? Is she a sadist, bipolar, attention seeking, or just another mean girl who did it because she could?\n\nBut really no matter what the reason, the fact is she victimized you and now your family is trying to do the same while protecting her.

Suffering is not the crime, causing the suffering is!", "NTA she didn\u2019t make a \u201cmistake\u201d she engaged in systematic bullying of you for years.

That's my point.  It's an extremely important decision that she must make intellectually if she is going to put this behind her.  Everyone that disagrees on this is making emotional considerations the most important part of the decision.  Using the words of important historical figures seems to be rejected by the group.  The failure to give appropriate consideration to the values expressed by important historical figures just means that lessons are being missed.   History is a required subject in school.  The reason for it is obvious.  Do we stop considering history when we are done with school.   If she chooses to continue to hate this person she becomes an asshole to herself.  She is the only one that she is harming.   I hope that she figures it out for herself, but I don't care what her decision is.", "These are \"historical\" figures you should take with a grain of salt.

He never really apologized for what he did (maybe he said \"sorry\" but there was no actual work to earn back my trust). Years later, when I still couldn't get past the hurt and anger about that incident, he routinely accused me of \"holding the past against him\" and \"refusing to forgive.\" \n\nI actually went out and read multiple books about forgiveness, because I  couldn't figure out how to truly forgive him in a way that would satisfy him. And I learned that even if someone apologizes, even if they actually change, you are not obligated to forgive them. You are not obligated to continue having any kind of a relationship with a person who hurt you, even if they feel bad, even if they try really hard to do better, even if they truly have changed. \n\nI don't know why it was so revelatory to me to learn that forgiveness is my choice. Forgiveness is for you, not for the other person. It is your choice to let go of the anger so it no longer occupies your brain. But it is perfectly acceptable to set a boundary that the only way you can let go of your anger is to end the relationship with the person who harmed you. \n\nI realized I could never feel the same way about my ex-husband after what he did to me, no matter how much he wanted me to. No matter how much \\*I\\* wanted to. I left him. And, funnily enough, now that we have been divorced for several years, that anger no longer consumes me.

Forgiveness can only be freely given, not demanded. \n\nAnd forgiveness is not mandatory nor owed.", "Ah yes, forgive someone who abused you because they went to therapy for not even a year and never apologized. \nGreat advice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc /s", "Worst comment ever.", "This is the comment of a current/former bully.\n\nShame on you u/cteavin.  You should try learning some empathy.\n\nBeing bullied, especially by family is extremely devastating.", "Probably not wrong. And then she'll be ignored and dismissed all over again. \"She's changed\" and then she's going to make sure you have no way to record her", "The negative downvotes for my opinion are welcomed because it reveals that your emotion overrules intellect.   I don't care what OP decides.  That's her business and her business alone.  I do care that she has information that feeds her mind and not her emotions.  She will be the asshole to herself if she chooses not to forgive because ultimately, she is the only one who will suffer.  Consult any therapist and you will get the same answer.  She will not be the asshole to me because I know what she is going to suffer for the lack of forgiving what seems to many, the unforgivable.", "oh so we're victim blaming now, ok.", "OP isn\u2019t the one \u201cruining\u201d Christmas, way to victim blame. This poor girl was emotionally abused and gaslit behind everyone\u2019s back to the point of weight loss and anxiety. They all saw SIL as kind & outgoing not capable of the accusations. OP had to get *proof* of the bullying so her own family would believe her. Put yourself in those shoes and tell me if you\u2019d be keen on celebrating the holiday with a family who wants to rug sweep all that trauma.", "Holy victim blaming, Batman. OP is NTA, but you sure are!", "She made her problems someone else's and that someone else might like to hear that they've delt with those issues before being around them again. It's really not nearly as complicated and hard to understand as you're making it out to be.", "If your Brother, the person that knows her best in the family, doesn't forgive her and is on your side...it really doesn't matter what the rest of the family things. The only 2 people well-aware of the situation agree.\n\nFamilies **tend** to want to sweep things under the rug if they're not fully knowledgeable about what they involve. They weren't really involved in what was happening, so to them one person was unfair and that person has now tried to work past it...so the problem should be over. Don't forget that while you dealt with it for a long time, they didn't. It was all new to them, which means it was quick.", "For the other Americans....\n9 stone is 126 pounds, 7.5 Stone is 105 pounds", "My rule is that for every month of a person's bad behavior I need to at least a year of constant changed behavior to believe it's different. For example, let's say it was 7 months of bullying. She would need 7  years of changed behavior for me to believe it, and so on. NTA. And the fact that she gave no reason for the bullying and was manipulative while doing it let's me know that she's never going to be honest about changing. She'll do just enough to get off the radar.", "She still is. It sounds like your instincs are right and its performance\n\nCorrect anyone who says mistake\nThe word is choice , made again and again and again.", "NTA: You are right not to forgive just yet because as you have said the apologies have only come about vague im sorrys. Not specific about her behavior to you and how she will change. Your brother clearly sees there is more going on then just the bullying and knows that more work needs to be done. Maybe the family wants to sweep it under the rug because she makes an act of showing change but not really or they just like to not deal with anything head on.", "NTA AT ALL. Smart long plan in garnishing the truth. Your SIL was (is) so caught up in her hatred she didn't even \"really\" try to hide the vitriol. Was it just you OP? Do you know the why in the targeting just you? SIL is jealous of what?", "I hope that you will seek counseling for yourself. That must have been an excruciating experience to go through and I hope you can heal from it. A counselor will help you and help you in what to say to explain to your family (not SIL). Good luck and much happiness going forward.", "For your own mental health and well-being you really do need to stay away from her. I'm sorry that your family invalidated your feelings and your experience", "NTA. After hearing how it made you feel a true apology would be for her include all the reasons (things she did or said) she's sorry for. She hasn't yet acknowledged your feelings on the matter. She's not sorry yet.\n\nReminds me of when I was promoted and one girl wasn't doing her job properly and I kept going to her trying to explain and she wouldn't hear it and she finally went to the supervisor telling him I was picking on her. I validated her feelings. I'm sorry if that's how I made you feel, it truly wasn't my intention to make you feel that way, I was getting frustrated because I was trying to show you the correct way to do the paperwork and you kept shutting me down. We're not the best of friends, but as far as work goes we get along great now and her work has greatly improved and when there is a problem she's more receptive to it. Totally different stories,  don't know why your story reminded me that (it happened 4 years ago). \n\nIf all she's done is say sorry please forgive me...and hasn't validated your feelings and/or said WHAT she is sorry for, then she's truly not sorry and you and your brother see right through her. She hasn't said enough for your forgiveness. Just be prepared for a backlash if your brother divorces her (terrible reasons to stick with someone you don't trust or like anymore .. just staying for the sake of the kids..who see more than people give them credit for).", "What did she say to you? Why can't you tell us?", "Let me guess.  SIL is a cow-like creature and the earth shakes beneath her feet when she walks.  It sounds like she sees you as both weak and a threat.  Bullies get their jollies from putting other people down as that's the only way they can feel 'up'.\n\nNTA - tell people that she makes you feel bad when in her presence and that ***you deserve to have your feelings respected.***", "Perfect!", "It might be because your brother is the only one in your family to have the emotional intelligence and foresight greater than a stalk of celery. Something like this can't be \"cured\" quickly and amends is more than a few texts.", "he's probably sick of her manipulating him too", "Edit 5 (lol) says OP is a woman.", "Yes. Forgiveness isn't the issue here, OP doesn't feel comfortable being around SIL. They don't ever have to be comfortable around this woman. Regardless of forgiveness.", "Don't go for Xmas. Send her a fake Oscar statue for her \"spectacular performances\" for the Best Actress in the Drama category.\n\nNTA & give brother plenty hugs. You will never know what he actually goes through behind closed doors.", "how people can actually be this naive? YOU are their family and they have known you your whole life and suddenly you make these weird accusations and they just sweep it away? like its not weird at all... \n\nshe was a literall stranger at the beginning but now everyone just sides with her. pff.\n\nshow them her \"sincere apology texts\"", "> Said she was sorry and hopes I can forgive her.\n\nSo, she hasn't promised not to do it again? \n\nReal apologies include more than just saying \"sorry\". NTA at all.", "Hi! I just want to tell you that your strength and resilience is inspiring. It\u2019s so hard to heal after abuse like that, and even harder when the abuser has so much support. If I can, 2 books that can be really helpful in maintaining that strength: Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Tawwab; and Untamed by Glennon Doyle. Very great tools to get through these tough moments. \n\nYou\u2019re not ruining Christmas, no matter what you choose. They are all so much more worried about the image, rather your insides, your well-being. Keep being your own champion, your own advocate. You are brilliant and beautiful and strong. Fuck traditions- especially when those traditions are more important than actual human beings. NTA, love.", "I wonder what\u2019s going on behind closed doors. The brother is the one person I would expect to be the most forgiving of the SIL. The fact that he isn\u2019t leads me to believe that therapy didn\u2019t go as well as he hoped because it uncovered things the rest of the family still doesn\u2019t know. \n\nSIL waged a whole campaign of terror that was so severe that it lead to lasting psychological damage and did so while being able to maintain a completely different persona to not just the public but to her closest loved ones. That is creepy! \n\n\nOP is NTA and I seriously wonder what the children\u2019s lives are like. Would anyone even know if they were being emotionally abused since she\u2019s so good at hiding it? Is she going to look for a new target now that OP is no longer an option for abuse. \n\nOP needs to put her family in a time out and make a new Christmas tradition by going on a mini vacation.", "Wanted to add, that even if you do forgive you don't have to forget. You can let go of your anger, hurt, disappointment, etc. but still keep in mind how that person is and deal with them within that context. I'm not even remotely saying OP has to forgive. Just throwing it out there. \n\nOP is NTA and kudos to OP's brother who is not letting this get swept under the rug.", "It sounds like he knows she hasn\u2019t really changed.", "This. NTA. No one has a right to demand that you forgive SIL. It's very clear that she hasn't really changed at all. She even ghosted you on her apology. That is not an apology. Anyone who has raised a teenager knows that a half-assed \"sorry\" is not an apology.", "Agreed. There is a reason why her brother believes she's capable of being cruel.", "THIS!\n\nThere's been no amends thus no forgiveness thus no moving on.\n\nLet them spend xmas w SIL & kids.\n\nYou and your brother do your own thing - starting w pancakes or whatever sounds delicious & fun.\n\nLet SIL try to hold the favors of the rest of your family w/o you there to be her punching bag and her husband to 'water down' her awfulness. \n\nIf the kids decide to join you two - they are old enough to decide for themselves.\n\nI'm 56 and I am having the best xmas I've ever had as in best of 4.\n\nIf I could go back in time, especially at OPs age I would tell myself to go do what will make me happy.\n\nMy family were unable to want to do that & won't change as long as I keep attending.\n\n& look out for who ends up being her foil - they're not gonna love being the new target.", "Yes, as someone that has a similar build this is problematic.", "covert to the family; overt to SIL who clearly the Narc feels threatened by for some reason or the other. Narcs want all the attention and focus on them. My guess OP is cute and popular and SIL will not have that.", "yeah learning that someone is extra evil when they think nobody's watching is honestly terrifying.  like you leave her at home with the kids for an hour, and she said everything was fine, but maybe she spanked them or said crazy shit to them while you were gone.  I would never trust a person like this once exposed", "You know, my parents abused me in horrible ways. I'm 28 and I still haven't forgiven them. One is dead 15? Years this Christmas and I STILL hate him. Somehow, it hasn't harmed me. Strange, the ABUSE they did caused LIFELONG TRAUMA, but my hate for them hasn't caused any damage.", "Your down vote is welcomed because it reveals that you disagree with my statement that nobody has to do anything that they don't want to do.   Your position then is that somebody has to do what somebody else wants them to do.  Are you an adult?  Is this the opinion that an adult would likely have?", "Also, I\u2019d like to give you the benefit of a doubt that you\u2019re just stuck in an old-school, people-pleasing mindset. I do get it, but it\u2019s very harmful to those who have been harmed deeply by someone. We\u2019re in a new age where the people who have been abused are beginning to be encouraged to set boundaries and stick to them to protect themselves, even from family members and friends \u201cwho mean well, and just want everyone to be together.\u201d It truly is okay for people to protect their peace, even if the people around them don\u2019t understand.", "Every situation I\u2019ve had to be around my abuser and try to avoid him, he just tries his hardest to find a way. Avoiding an abuser at the same event isn\u2019t as simple as it may seem.", "That's a GREAT question !!", "This. I truly feel \u201cforgiveness\u201d is a pink bubble created by people outside of the incident. Mostly because they want to keep their normal life and not want to be involved in conflicts. Forgiveness creates an illusion that everything is alright. \n\nF*ck forgiveness! The best treatment of bullies is just \u201cI do not want to deal with you anymore and please stay away from my life\u201d.", "The family doesn't get it as it is emotional abuse.  If it had been physical abuse, would it be more obvious to them?  I'm glad OP called her out and I 100% agree if the husband and OP say they are not ready, SIL should not be at the families holiday together.  OPs family is actual is cruel.  They are indeed heaping more abuse on OP.  NTA OP.", "Or, since the family thinks that SIL is so great, set up some boundaries. SIL is not allowed in the same room as OP, SIL is not allowed to talk to OP. SIL is to be handcuffed to another family at all times in order to make sure she complies with these rules. SIL is to publicly ask for forgiveness after explaining why she did this for so long. All of the family it to also publicly apologize to OP for not believing her. SIL has to leave immediately if OP feels uncomfortable.", "Exactly, her brother knows what his own wife is like. He's probably seen her do other awful things, too. Her family are T A here for not listening to him.", ">**You and your brother do your own thing - starting w pancakes or whatever sounds delicious & fun.**\n\nYES and have a soulful heart to heart regarding this serious matter and dig deep on his POV regarding his wife and what's really happening behind THEIR closed doors. Like other have mentioned the children need to be questioned as well (by a professional?)?", "Which, now that I think about it, is likely why divorce hasn't happened yet.  He knows that if he leaves the kids have no one to protect them.  Who wants to bet on divorce papers being served on the youngests 18th birthday?", "so basically, I was mean to you because I'm a self centered jealous wackjob that couldn't handle another female being in my husband's life, and I wanted everyone to hate you.  yeah I doubt she's gonna come to that realization anytime soon lol", "She could be doing it to her kids! Especially now she has been denied access to her favorite target. Those kids need to see a therapist to make sure they are okay.", "I'm thinking the oldest. The youngest will be 15 and can choose to stay with the dad.", "that isnt a personal attack buddy, you seem kinda sensitive lol", "Or to one of her kids, while the other is her golden child. So damaging.", "Like yours?", "What match are you proposing?   Your emotional pleas versus what?", "Were the Nazis opinion on Jews correct? The answer is no. Point proven."]}
