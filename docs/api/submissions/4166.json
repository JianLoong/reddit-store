She always made sure to do it whenever I was alone or where nobody could see. It was frustrating because my brother took it to mean I didn\u2019t like her as she had a very different public persona. I don\u2019t blame him for this but I did decide to document everything as at the time I was too scared to show anybody. However I photographed her text exchanges and started recording her. I waited specifically until an important family gathering and after years of her bullying, I exposed it to everybody. She couldn\u2019t deny it. Broke down in tears trying to say that she \u2018didn\u2019t mean it\u2019 and was \u2018sorry\u2019 and she \u2018didn\u2019t know why I did it.\u2019\n\nThe whole family was mad and my brother threatened divorce unless she agreed to therapy and marriage counselling. She went to intense therapy to work out her issues and tried to make amends but I don\u2019t care. She was in my words a horrible spiteful bitch and I distanced myself from everyone.\n\nWith Christmas coming up, everyone wants me there bur SIL will be there too. My parents are asking if I\u2019ll forgive SIL as it seems like therapy has worked and is making an effort to seek solid redemption for her actions. I said I don\u2019t care if she changed, it\u2019s the fact that she offered pathetic excuses for her behaviour and has barely tried to make amends. She\u2019s reached  out 5 times literally saying she was sorry and that\u2019s it. Any other \u2018redemption\u2019 has been through family members. It feels like my family have actually taken HER side as opposed to mine which hurts.\n\nMy brother has done a lot of couples counselling with her but hates how my parents are trying to force me to forgive her. Even he doesn\u2019t forgive her. I don\u2019t blame him for wanting to work on his marriage though as they have kids. He\u2019s the only one really on my side\n\nBasically I\u2019m the social pariah who is refusing to forgive SIL who made a \u2018mistake\u2019. I\u2019ve said if that\u2019s how I\u2019m\nSeem fine I won\u2019t be coming to Christmas. Brother has actually threatened the same saying the kids and SIL can go and he\u2019ll just spend it with me. Now I\u2019m the AH who is ruining Christmas.\n\nETA: I can\u2019t mention explicit details but it was so bad I lost almost 2 stone in weight. I wasn\u2019t eating. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was always stressed and on edge.\n\nETA 2: the reveal only happened over a year ago. She started therapy not long after but in reality she went for several months and has stopped it completely. Her reaching out to me has been really half assed so it doesn\u2019t seem genuine to me. Family members seem to think she\u2019s completely cured after this, but my brother is not convinced at all. Idk if they\u2019re still in marriage counselling but their marriage is still shaky. Basically each text was along the lines of \u2018Im sorry. Please forgive me.\u2019 She did not explain what issues she was working through. She did not offer more than a half assed apology and that\u2019s it. She appears more apologetic to the family, not me. I got the same text 5 times whereas she was seen as grovelling and begging my family\u2019s forgiveness but this has never happened to me.\n\nETA 3: I did try to give her the benefit of the doubt when she texted me the first time. I attempted to explain how she made me feel and why I was so angry and didn\u2019t want to forgive her, but I got radio silence. Basically, she ghosted me. Then, she would text a while later telling me the same thing and she just wouldn\u2019t hear what I was trying to say.\n\nETA 4; bar my brother, my whole family are keen to sweep this under the rug. It feels like they\u2019re favouring her and minimising my experiences. So no it\u2019s not as simple as that SIL is trying and that I should forgive her, it\u2019s literally like the whole ordeal is trying to be forgotten and my brother and I are the only ones not doing that.", "created_utc": 1670421959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf1xqd/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_sil_after_shes/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone who actually accepts what they have done wrong doesn't make excuses--they own it; just saying \"sorry\" a bunch of times is not real contrition.  Given how hard you had to work to get your family to even see what was going on, they have some ground to cover here too and they are doing their case no good by acting like a bunch of flying monkeys and enabling SILs less than meaningful change of heart.  You have every right to not want to spend time with any of them right now.  Sounds as if your brother is on your side, so try to enjoy a nice holiday with him and see how things go next year.", "NTA.

But what was the point of exposing her if you didnt want her to stop and change? If she had changed but you now claim not to care? SIL is by no means innocent but it sounds like she has done the work but you refuse to move past her previous behavior.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready or don\u2019t want to forgive her you need to communicate with your family and let them know where you are in this process.

How much can she have changed, really?", "NTA.  \nTypical story of parents disregarding very real trauma and issues so they can pretend to stand by family values when they have a full happy family Christmas.

They could at LEAST offer something like one part of the day she is invited but then not for another part.

You don't owe someone forgiveness. She treated you horribly and it's great she's gotten therapy but that doesn't repair the damage she's done to you. Her husband even agrees with you.", "NTA,  how would your family know if the therapy worked if she only showed you her true face? The only way to truly know is to leave her alone with her victim, you. And you have understandably, no desire to be part of that experiment.", "NTA, no one has any right to expect you to forgive SIL. It\u2019s your decision. However, she also shouldn\u2019t be causing you to lose out at family gatherings, she just isn\u2019t important. If it would be easy to leave than I say try and just make sure you are never alone with her. If she tries to follow you into the kitchen or towards the bathroom just stop and turn around and tell your brother to keep her away from you.

OP, did your SIL ever give an explanation for her detestable behavior?

Suffering is not the crime, causing the suffering is!", "NTA she didn\u2019t make a \u201cmistake\u201d she engaged in systematic bullying of you for years.
