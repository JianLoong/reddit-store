Now that pretty much everyone in my family thinks I'm horrendous, I wanted an outside opinion.\n\nMy husband passed away recently after a very sudden and difficult struggle with cirrhosis. It was easily the worst thing to happen in my life. The damage was invisible for years, we never saw it coming. He got so sick, so fast. After they diagnosed him, he lived a little over a year.\nWe called all our family, including his mother, who otherwise we don't have much contact with. I've always hated that woman. She has always been cruel to him, put him down every chance she could. When we called saying her son was terminally ill, she first denied it, insisted we were lying. Then she went on about how we should've seen this coming, that this is just what happens when you're a drunk. Of course this shut down the call pretty fast. She only called once after that, and we didn't pick up.\nA little over a year later, I had to bring him to the hospital and in two days, he was gone. At that point, he was already just so confused and hardly conscious. I told my parents and his brothers, and we were the last people to see him.\nI wasn't doing very well at the time either, everything just happened so fast. I wasn't ready to make any of those decisions, and between the doctors and the bills and just seeing him so sick, I didn't even think about his mother. In the days after, I just didn't want to deal with her. I know that's horrible, but I was just so tired. \n\nShe called me a few weeks later, I'm not sure how she heard. She was hysterical, which I know is understandable. She said I robbed her of saying goodbye to her son, and robbed him of a proper service. I should have just hung up, but I was so hurt and so angry. I informed her a very nice service was held, which every important person in his life was there. I said she must be mistaken and blocked her number.\nShe's gone ballistic. Called my brother in laws in tears about how I've ruined her life, gone on facebook about how devastated she is and publicly begging me to talk to her, how she just wants his things and to know what happened.\nEven my parents said it wasn't my place to make that choice for my husband, and I should try to talk with her.\n\nI know I probably should. I know he was hers before he was mine. But she made him miserable, and if he had been able to choose, I know he wouldn't have wanted her there. I don't think she deserved to see him, and I don't think she deserves to have any of the things that were his.\nBut now that I write it all out, it really sounds horrible. Maybe I'm out of line to make that call. The only people who haven't said I was being cruel are my husband's two brothers, who know how she can be.\n\nBut other than them, she was the only family he had.
