Now that pretty much everyone in my family thinks I'm horrendous, I wanted an outside opinion.\n\nMy husband passed away recently after a very sudden and difficult struggle with cirrhosis. It was easily the worst thing to happen in my life. The damage was invisible for years, we never saw it coming. He got so sick, so fast. After they diagnosed him, he lived a little over a year.\nWe called all our family, including his mother, who otherwise we don't have much contact with. I've always hated that woman. She has always been cruel to him, put him down every chance she could. When we called saying her son was terminally ill, she first denied it, insisted we were lying. Then she went on about how we should've seen this coming, that this is just what happens when you're a drunk. Of course this shut down the call pretty fast. She only called once after that, and we didn't pick up.\nA little over a year later, I had to bring him to the hospital and in two days, he was gone. At that point, he was already just so confused and hardly conscious. I told my parents and his brothers, and we were the last people to see him.\nI wasn't doing very well at the time either, everything just happened so fast. I wasn't ready to make any of those decisions, and between the doctors and the bills and just seeing him so sick, I didn't even think about his mother. In the days after, I just didn't want to deal with her. I know that's horrible, but I was just so tired. \n\nShe called me a few weeks later, I'm not sure how she heard. She was hysterical, which I know is understandable. She said I robbed her of saying goodbye to her son, and robbed him of a proper service. I should have just hung up, but I was so hurt and so angry. I informed her a very nice service was held, which every important person in his life was there. I said she must be mistaken and blocked her number.\nShe's gone ballistic. Called my brother in laws in tears about how I've ruined her life, gone on facebook about how devastated she is and publicly begging me to talk to her, how she just wants his things and to know what happened.\nEven my parents said it wasn't my place to make that choice for my husband, and I should try to talk with her.\n\nI know I probably should. I know he was hers before he was mine. But she made him miserable, and if he had been able to choose, I know he wouldn't have wanted her there. I don't think she deserved to see him, and I don't think she deserves to have any of the things that were his.\nBut now that I write it all out, it really sounds horrible. Maybe I'm out of line to make that call. The only people who haven't said I was being cruel are my husband's two brothers, who know how she can be.\n\nBut other than them, she was the only family he had.

She realized her errors too late and rather than taking time to reflect go to therapy and mourn in a healthy way, she took it out on you. She LEFT YOU to make those decisions with her inaction. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through some of the most tragic things that can happen to a person- the last thing you need is to deal with this woman\u2019s misplaced guilt.", "NTA you\u2019re slaying. Love the \u201cyou have the wrong number\u201d", "NTA - it wasn\u2019t your responsibility. Let her rattle her cage. She will go away when she gets no traction.", "NTA OP, and I'm so sorry for your loss :(\n\nMy dad had a brother seven years older than him, and a sister seven years younger.  My aunt made my grandparents' lives very difficult in many ways...she was a very difficult child/teen, and super-irresponsible as an adult, even up to this day (she's around 70 years old now).  Because of this, and her behaviors throughout her life, and because of the age gaps, my dad & uncle weren't very close to my aunt once they were all adults.  My dad & uncle did remain close to each other throughout the years.\n\nMy uncle passed away a few years ago around the age of 80.  He had been married to his wife for about 55 years; his wife also had a poor relationship with my aunt.  At the funeral, his wife specifically told my dad that she did NOT want my aunt to be informed.  We were a little uncomfortable with this, BUT we never said a peep because it was HER decision whether or not to inform, not ours.", "NTA", "NTA. If his brothers didn't tell her, you know how bad this woman is. Nope. Mourn him. Don't talk to her. Don't give her anything. She humiliated her son when he told her what happened.", "INFO did you and your husband really never talk about funeral plans and if he wanted his mom the know/be there?", "She had a year to see him but didn't. Her other sons didn't say anything either. Of course she's upset, her son died, but she had a year! Nta.", "I am saying NTA. Brothers could have called her but seems as if they knew he wouldn\u2019t want her there.", "NTA. If her own sons didn't remember/think about telling her that says plenty. \n\nI'd tell your family that very thing, she had 2 other sons who were alive and helping with all the planning and they didn't tell her. If your parents keep pushing tell them they could have called her as well. They knew he had a mother..", "NTA. His brothers could have told her. If your husband wanted her involved in his death he would have facilitated that prior to his actual death. It sounds like you both knew it was coming eventually? If she truly cared for him she would have reached out more then once in his final year. This is clearly all a show or she\u2019s ticked off at herself and blaming anyone but herself. Either way it\u2019s NOT YOUR FAULT!", "NTA \n\nWe are completely no contact with my husbands parents, they only know about the existence of my first child and they don\u2019t know I\u2019m currently pregnant, nor will they ever have a relationship with any of my children for the rest of their lives. If my husband were to die, if I did tell them I wouldn\u2019t let them attend the funeral because they\u2019re not allowed around my children and my children would have more of a right to say goodbye to their father than his horrible sperm and egg donors.", "I want to say YTA so bad......but there had to have been so many other people that could have told her.....including the siblings......so I feel like if they aren't even willing to tell her then there has to be a lot more and I think I'll end up saying NTA", "NTA \n\nMy condolences OP.", "NTA,block her and get her out of your life. She's not your problem.", "NTA. Regardless of her giving birth to him, OP, you did nothing wrong here. It is apparent that she was not part of his life in any meaningful way and the fact that his brothers (two of them) failed to notify her speaks volumes.\n\nAnd no, she doesn't get anything of his, those things are part of YOUR life with him, not hers. Just go on and live your life and hopefully be happy again when you are ready.", "I'm going to say NTA. When you told her your husband was terminally ill, she insisted you were lying. I'd suspect she said the same if you told her he was in his final hours as well.\n\nAnd while, it may have been nice for her to be part of the service, her antics here indicate she would probably have made a scene. You were better off handling things as you did. You have no ties to this woman any more.", "NTA. She tried for contact once after learning he was terminal. That being said it is very likely your former mother in law is truly grieving her son. Even awful parents love their children if they are incapable of demonstrating that love. If you want to be generous write a brief letter or email detailing his decline and maybe include a possession of your husband\u2019s (such as a shirt or something that was his but doesn\u2019t hold high value to you). If you aren\u2019t able to do that it is completely okay as well. Focus on your own healing and grief, block anyone you need to and let your tribe support you during this time. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA- I find it suspicious that she just wants his things. He was a long grown and long married man. What entitles her to his things?  I would not hesitate to call out her cruelty and hypocrisy one of her Facebook posts. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\ni'm sorry for your loss", "I'm very sorry for your loss. You did the right thing. NTA", "We can\u2019t vote on this. This is beyond a simple Reddit AITAH post, this is a deeply personal and profound loss that you have suffered. I am sorry for your loss and want to wish you well as you heal from this tragic experience. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would probably ask your husband\u2019s brothers to handle her. I would block her from contacting you. You have already done enough for your husband. She hasn\u2019t been there for you and it is over. The only thing left to do is to heal and recover.", "NTA. If your husband wanted her in hus life he could had reached out even knowing you do not like her.  He could had. spoken to you. Who would deny your spouse\u2019s final wishes.  But again he could had been reaching out.  He never felt compiled to say goodbye so you ARE FINE.  My kids still are young and live in my house.  If I find out terminally ill I am flying or doing whatever possible to visit them. I DO NOT stop after one call not returned.  She only has self to blame.  She is playing the victim card right now.  She will get her 15 mins of fame and leave you alone soon I hope", "NTA\nEven if I ignore the fact that her other sons were informed - she had a full year to make amends with her son/your husband.   She is grieving - so are you.  But I would be able to live with your behavior and decisions. MIL\u2026 she has to live with her own behavior which I can\u2019t condone.", "NTA Did your husband try to talk to his mother after he became sick? Did you deny him the use of a phone? Why would his mother be entitled to anything of his unless he requested it. Go on with your life & heal, maybe in time you will be able to talk to MIL. That is your decision to make.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your problem and you owe her nothing.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t think there are any right answers in this situation, everyone just needs to try to heal and move on as best as possible.", "NTA.\n\nI'm on your side. \n\nYour MIL brought this on herself by being a toxic judging woman.  All her anger is actually directed at herself.\n\nYour BILs could have been the ones to have told her.  That's who she needed to hear it from.  They can be the buffer between you and her, if they choose.  I wouldn't ever communicate with her again.\n\nYou mention she wants his things.  Those things are yours now.   She doesn't need them.\n\nIn short, and rather bluntly, she messed up her own life.  You gave your husband the love and care he needed for his final year, and she gave him judgment.  You grieve in your own way without any influence from any family,", "YTA, there's no excuse for not telling her her son died! I'm sorry for your loss but wow!", "That\u2019s what I was going to comment on. OP told his brothers, if they also decided not to put their mom in the loop then it\u2019s safe to say that was the right decision.", "They saw him in his last moments, didn't wonder why mom wasn't there, and didn't bother to call her. Was honestly prepared to go all Y T A for it but it's seems there's a lot of sad everywhere.\n\nThe details may vary but it looks like I can't blame them. Given how the husband was treated, he may not have wanted to see her as well. He may have told the brothers. I don't know.\n\nIn the end, NC is NC, and what seems to be a good reason. NTA.", "there was so much other direct family like the brothers why did they not inform his mom?  besides the fact when they said he was terminal she called the op a liar and proceeded to say awful things.", "Probably not a good thing to mention though. Why throw them under the bus for no reason? The only thing that would do is puss off two more people. It was her decision and she can stand by that because she knows her husband wouldn't have wanted her there. The brothers did not make that decision.", "Exactly what I wondered.", "Boom! Right there! You just shut this whole thing down with that simple question. NTA. Next!", "This!", "I think it's very telling that neither of the brothers informed their mother and that they are both on OP's side now. They know better than others who MIL is and what kind of a mother she was to OP's late husband. That alone makes it an easy NTA", "TBF those initial reactions aren\u2019t unheard of when it comes to grief, denial and anger. However, OP stated after that his mom often made him feel miserable, so she was still a sucky parent.", "They didn't want to tell her either, which casts OP's decision in a much more favorable light.", "Greed, selfishness, and general assholery.", "The relationship wasn't strained, it was nonexistent - full NC for the entirety of his illness.", "Why, though?  His mother thought they were lying when they told her his diagnosis, and didn't really bother to contact him to see how he was before he died.  She knew the end was coming, and she could've visited to say her goodbyes any time in that year.  *Now* she wants to play the victim?  The poor loving mother denied her chance to say goodbye?  No.  No.  No.\n\nOP, NTA.  This internet stranger is proud of you for doing what it took to allow your husband not to have to deal with that woman.  He didn't need that stress.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss.  You did the right thing.", "read the post. the last time the son spoke to the mother was A YEAR AGO when he told her he was dying, she didn't believe it and was mean to him.\n\nno shit they were NC.", "Her husband brothers also didn\u2019t tell their mom.", "Brothera could have told MIL, but MIL is putting it all on OP. Can\u2019t blame them for going NC. NTA.", "I think that's the answer, since they're supporting her now.", "Judging by the post they seem to be on OP\u2019s side so that would be a reasonable assumption", "I wonder if his other two brothers are also no contact with their mother and don\u2019t even want to talk to either.", "In addition she had a YEAR to go visit and check in.", "Your brother in laws' support should be all the answer you need. They knew him and they know her, and they support your decision not to tell her. His mother had an entire year to try to be a good mother with his impending death, and she was only interested in making a public display of it once he was dead.\n\nMy mother's sister didn't tell her she was dying. My mother only found out she had died a year after the fact. My mother's sister made the right choice in not telling my mother, because it wouldn't have brought the dying woman any comfort, and it wouldn't have made my mother any better of a sister in those final days.", "The fact that your husband\u2019s two brothers, MIL own sons, didn\u2019t tell their mother about his death speaks volumes. You don\u2019t owe her anything. Block her on everything so that you can grieve in peace. So sorry for your loss!", "She wasn\u2019t going to become a good mother on his deathbed, and perhaps would have made it much more traumatic for you. I don\u2019t believe that you did anything wrong here, and if I were you I would stay off of social media if she\u2019s blasting you. I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss. NTA.", "No you didn\u2019t. There was no chance there for you to fuck up. She just invented the idea and then got mad at you for it. She was never going to be invited; no one involved wanted her there. That is her fault, for her actions. You can\u2019t take away a chance that didn\u2019t exist.", "I know, which is why I personally lean toward NTA. OP had enough on her plate. The phone call would have been the right thing to do, but I really don't blame her for not doing it.", "Then why are they supporting her now?", "No, OP shouldn't have to call this awful mother and have her scream at her saying no he isn't dead or some other crazy thing while she's grieving. The mother made her bed a year ago and never even tried to mend the relationship."]}
