Now that pretty much everyone in my family thinks I'm horrendous, I wanted an outside opinion.\n\nMy husband passed away recently after a very sudden and difficult struggle with cirrhosis. It was easily the worst thing to happen in my life. The damage was invisible for years, we never saw it coming. He got so sick, so fast. After they diagnosed him, he lived a little over a year.\nWe called all our family, including his mother, who otherwise we don't have much contact with. I've always hated that woman. She has always been cruel to him, put him down every chance she could. When we called saying her son was terminally ill, she first denied it, insisted we were lying. Then she went on about how we should've seen this coming, that this is just what happens when you're a drunk. Of course this shut down the call pretty fast. She only called once after that, and we didn't pick up.\nA little over a year later, I had to bring him to the hospital and in two days, he was gone. At that point, he was already just so confused and hardly conscious. I told my parents and his brothers, and we were the last people to see him.\nI wasn't doing very well at the time either, everything just happened so fast. I wasn't ready to make any of those decisions, and between the doctors and the bills and just seeing him so sick, I didn't even think about his mother. In the days after, I just didn't want to deal with her. I know that's horrible, but I was just so tired. \n\nShe called me a few weeks later, I'm not sure how she heard. She was hysterical, which I know is understandable. She said I robbed her of saying goodbye to her son, and robbed him of a proper service. I should have just hung up, but I was so hurt and so angry. I informed her a very nice service was held, which every important person in his life was there. I said she must be mistaken and blocked her number.\nShe's gone ballistic. Called my brother in laws in tears about how I've ruined her life, gone on facebook about how devastated she is and publicly begging me to talk to her, how she just wants his things and to know what happened.\nEven my parents said it wasn't my place to make that choice for my husband, and I should try to talk with her.\n\nI know I probably should. I know he was hers before he was mine. But she made him miserable, and if he had been able to choose, I know he wouldn't have wanted her there. I don't think she deserved to see him, and I don't think she deserves to have any of the things that were his.\nBut now that I write it all out, it really sounds horrible. Maybe I'm out of line to make that call. The only people who haven't said I was being cruel are my husband's two brothers, who know how she can be.\n\nBut other than them, she was the only family he had.

This is a dude who terrorized my childhood. Saying he wasn't nice to our mom is being extremely generous. He doesn't have a single healthy bond with anyone in the whole family at this point. He was such a creep that he remains the only person I've ever met who I wonder from time to time if he's ever done some seriously dark crimes and might be a sociopath. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD from the experiences I had with him; so has another of my siblings.\n\nBut the relationship between him and his mother exists independently from me.

I doubt she was ever a good maternal figure for any of her sons.", "The living family he chose to be a part of his life agreed with you about what he would\u2019ve wanted. Nta and I\u2019m so sorry.", "Re: Mommy Dearest\u2026It\u2019s amazing how much revisionist history goes on after the person has died and the guilt sets in. NTA", "Nope. That's not on you and you should NOT feel guilty about any of this. She had plenty of chances, including when you told her he was terminally ill. She is the one that fucked up her last chance.", ">She has never been a good mother, but I fucked up her last chance to try.\n\nThe lady has two other sons. If she wants to be a good mother, she could focus on the living sons, there is no repairing relationship with someone who has passed even if she could put up a show for the funeral. Also, your husband had a year to reach out to your mother /give instructions on how to deal with her. Seems like he didn't care, so you shouldn't either.", "OP, this is your answer right here.  Your husband's brothers know this woman better than the people telling you that you made a mistake. If they agree with your choices, and you husband did not try to contact his mother in the year since the phone call, you made the right choice.  MIL is toxic.  Your husband didn't need that and you don't need that.  Block MIL and don't engage with her anymore. Don't give her any of his belongings - those hold much more meaning to you than to her.  Grieve your husband and focus on yourself right now.\n\nPerhaps MIL should have been informed after your husband passed away, but that is a lot to ask of a grieving widow.  If your brothers-in-law did not see fit to call her, then I don't think you are in the wrong here either.  \n\nOP you are NTA.  I am very sorry for your loss.", "It\u2019s possible that all 3 of them are alcoholics. My mom & her two siblings were all addicts. That\u2019s why I asked for info. It\u2019s not uncommon to have multiple addicts in one family. If that\u2019s the case the mom could just be fed up. If the op\u2019s husband had liver issues that were not caused by alcohol the the op is not in the wrong at all", "I agree with everything you\u2019ve said but I would like to add something: alcoholics and enablers tend to find each other. My mom married a man who claimed he just liked to drink but wasn\u2019t addicted to it. He also said he loved my mom so much that he would help her get clean. Instead he routinely took her to the bar (she couldn\u2019t drive), bought alcohol for them to drink at home, and took weekly pictures of them drinking together and posted them online. When she died he claimed she didn\u2019t know she was an alcoholic", "Plus she would have stripped away all peacefulness of your husbands final moments on earth. He was able to pass knowing he was surrounded by love with those who meant the most to him. Not distressed or agitated.", "That would be a leap, a rational leap I will say, but a leap none the less when Op has pointed out that the MIL was verbally abusive towards her son and overall unpleasant to deal with. If she was fed up why even speak to him if it would only bring her more pain of seeing her son as an alcoholic?", "I think the key point is that she did expect someone to reach out. You know, there are several family members who had the news and could have shared it with anyone, or even posted it on social media. So now she's realizing that everyone in her extended family hates her, and she's lashing out at just one person.\n\nAnother possibility is that actually she did find out from some other relative, but because she's a giant jerk, she's lying about it now just to get some attention. It's not like she could have caused a stink at the funeral and made any friends, but now she can play the victim all the way.", "Yes, yes she did bc it's all about HER not her son & not OP.", "In other words, the only person MIL has to blame is herself as she so blatantly has proven.", "Because no matter how bad it gets there will always be a part of you that loves the addict. You remember them before the addiction took over. If it was alcohol related the mom would still be devastated thinking of the son that she lost due to alcohol and then realizing she will lose him again to death. I mean no disrespect, but unless you\u2019ve loved and addict it\u2019s really hard to understand how complex the feelings are. That\u2019s why I say that the decision truly depends on whether or not the husband was an alcoholic", "I really mean no disrespect and I say this as a woman raised by a former drug addict who nearly over dosed and almost died on the table more times than I'm comfortable counting who use to shoot up while my brothers banged on the door for him to come play with them; loving an addict is the hardest thing ever. But sometimes choosing your own mental health and stability when someone is truly a lost cause cutting the cord is the best solution. If he was an addict that was that far gone then the mom had to know sooner or later it would catch up to him.", "I 100% agree", "NTA if she was that concerned why did she not keep in touch with her son after you told her he was sick? On top of that you told her brothers who could have easily told her if they felt she needed to know. \n\nThe fact that his brothers have not criticised your decision speaks volumes. Your family do not know your husband\u2019s family dynamics and if they can\u2019t support you they should say nothing at all. \n\nCondolences on your loss op. Save your energy to look after yourself and not on your husbands mother.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. My father passed away from the same thing and his mother treated my stepmom very terribly while his health declined. But I couldn\u2019t imagine being a mother and not being able to say goodbye to her son. Just as you couldn\u2019t imagine he would pass so suddenly.\n\nESH", "The MIL was probably informed. She didn\u2019t show up and wanted to have some drama to post on FB-Insta-TikTok", "OP should post a link to this post on their FB page. Or maybe post the link in response to one of her FB rants.\n\nAs a side note, I hate very private arguments done on social media. I broke up with a woman (pretty toxic) and she unfriended and blocked me on FB and then began posting all sorts of shitty things. My friends are like WTF? And read me a few - truly unhinged. It was clear her posts were making her look much crazier (duh) than they were hurting me. She took them all down after one of her friends reminded her that what\u2019s on the internet, stays on the internet.", "As someone with a mother like her, there is absolutely no value in contacting her now. Husband is no longer in the picture (so sorry, OP), so they have absolutely nothing to talk about.\n\nAll you'd achieve is fanning her melodramatic flames. Shut it down and don't react or interact with anything from her.", "Another take on a \u201enormal\u201c family:\nMan informs mother that he is seriously ill, mother is shocked and asks if she can do anything to help.\nMother will call regularly for updates and even ask if she can come visit/help.\nA \u201enormal\u201c mother would be involved and wouldn\u2019t ever think about making stupid accusations.\n\nOP is definitely NTA", "Probably not the brothers. If she\u2019s as awful as she appears to be from OP\u2019s post, then having the brothers there would likely result in MIL trying to manipulate them and turn them against OP. An objective third party, like an actual mediator, would be safer for OP.", "Honestly, not telling the mom was honoring the husband's memory.  She called him a drunk and her reaction to the news he was terminal was heinous. Add in the brothers not being in contact with her? \n\nAgreed, NTA at all.", "That line frustrated me, too. As a spouse it *is* legally and morally your place to make those kinds of decisions.", "The husband literally had brothers and knew about his death and the funeral. Why is it on op to inform the MIL? Also the brothers support her decision", "In a world of social media, i'd expect a few posts on any of the platforms.  And no one is mutual friends between OP, her BILs, and MIL?   NO ONE came to visit, NO one called, NO one messaged her to say \"sorry for your loss\"?    \n\nHow out of touch with your kids do you have to be to not know one of them died until weeks later?", "The \"liar\" thing is fairly normal, actually. Not going to slam anyone for that. Flat out refusal to acknowledge that the end is nigh, not processing, totally cool with that. Takes a lot of people a bit to chew on it, and the initial reaction is 'fight or flight,' and there's nowhere to fly to. So \"LIES!!!\" is pretty common. \n\n\"This is what you get?\" That's a done-zo right there. THAT'S not normal. Will TOTALLY slam her for that bit.", "Based on her reaction about finding out that the husband had a terminal illness, I\u2019d say the chances are unfortunately very high.", ">she could have asked her husband's brothers to inform their mother.\n\nThat's...not a thing. Like, you don't need to tell a guy \"can you tell your mother that her son passed away\", people usually do that on their own, they don't need to be prompted to do it.", "They are adults and should have offered imo. But in my experience death, like birth, is seen as women's stuff. So they didn't. They should have told their mother. Dicks.", "Or... He was a drunk and she tried warning him multiple times, but OP was an enabler, which is why they went LC/NC.", "If she wasn\u2019t there when he was alive, you don\u2019t need to have her in his death. She was never there when she discovered his illness. She\u2019s taking her feelings out on you and that sucks but you owe her nothing because she was never there. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your husband\u2019s passing and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this as you grieve. Take time for you first.", "MIL's reaction to the news is also not a thing. People don't normally react like that to news of a terminal illness and people going through the death of their spouse don't normally have to deal with someone like MIL. In which case I think it's not too difficult to understand that the OP wouldn't have wanted to have any contact with her and would gladly have left the job of telling her and giving her details about the funeral to family members - direct siblings, even - who were attending.", "And the fact that they didn't really says a lot about the mother, and their own relationship with her.\n\nNever in my life have I gone several weeks without speaking to my parents, and the mention of the death of such a close family member could not be avoided.  Either the brothers didn't speak to her in that time (and didn't consider their mother close enough to help them cope with their own grief), or they purposely avoided telling her, which says a lot.", "They \u201cknew how she was\u201d. See comment.", "Why is the fault on op? The husbands brothers knew.", "They also presumably attended the funeral. Like if the mother wasn't there, they would have surely brought it up and asked why, and then informed the mother afterwards. But they didn't. They didn't find it weird that their mom wasn't there during his final hours, and during the service. Which makes me think that either they're also no contact with the mom, or know that their brother and SIL wouldn't have wanted her anywhere near them and respected that.", "yeah I get why it seems overwhelming to OP that everyone is on the MILs side  \n\nbut that's not true\n\nthe only people on the MILs side are the people who don't really know her\n\nthe people who know her best, her direct family? nope not a single one of them is siding with her", "I mean if you're an alcoholic you know that it's very much a possibility that you'll get sick and die because of it. In this case I think the wife is more to blame because why did she never tried to help him? Or maybe he didn't wanted to be helped which at that point why would you want a relationship with someone like that?", "Yeah.\n\nI feel for the MIL, I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child and not even know.\n\nBut she kind of did this to herself by harassing OP and terminally ill son!\n\nAnd I find it impossible to call OP TA for going NC with a harasser, and then forgetting to contact her while grieving her husband.", "Right? I went low contact with my aunt after finding out she stole all my mom\u2019s expensive jewelry and pawned it for herself while her little sister, mom was on her death bed. My cousins told me the week after our aunt\u2019s funeral that she had died two weeks prior.\n \nI was upset, but that\u2019s a consequence of being low contact with someone, you get left out of the loop. \n\nOP is NTA for respecting her husband\u2019s low contact with his mom, especially since husband\u2019s siblings also knew and could have informed her.", "If the husband really had an alcohol problem, it's worth consider MIL had bad experiences relating to the fact that a close family member was an addict. It's hard to have an addict in the family. They do terrible things, yeah it' s not their fauly, they're not being themselves when dead drunk etc but you still suffer the brunt of it. It takes quite a lot to drink yourself to death. Note OP doesn't state any ages.", "Yeah, I could kind of understand it as an initial reaction. It is unkind and a bit unfair, as nobody plants to die usually.\n\nBut my partner has increased his smoking habit. Used to only smoke during parties, now he smokes almost daily. If he would come home with lung cancer, I wish I will respond in a kind and supportive way. But I will definitely THINK it is kind of how own fault too. But when you get emotional, who knows what things we say out loud...\n\nDefinitely not a reason to keep saying it after the first initial reaction and not a reason to make someone miserable for the little time you have... But as an initial reaction, I get it.", "I feel like you should have told her right away when he passed, but your choices for not having her visit was what was best for him. ESH", "And the fact that the brothers don\u2019t think that OP did anything wrong. They know how the women behaves. Everyone else is picturing their idea of who she is and most people don\u2019t want to believe that a mother grieving her child is in the wrong\u2026 but it sounds like she earned that NC.", "In a normal family, when your child tells you they are terminally ill, you run to their side, bury whatever disagreement you have with their partner, assist with all there is to do and think before and after a death , help organise the funerals, and don't need to be informed of the date.", ">And anyone with a judgement beginning with a Y; congratulations, your parents don't suck as badly as this.\n\nYeah it's like, tell me you didn't have an abusive parent without telling me you didn't have an abusive parent", "No. She has no obligation to tell his mother. The brothers could have done it. But they didn\u2019t either. Pretty much cementing the fact the the mother shouldn\u2019t have been at the funeral and was not wanted there by the family.", "Your comment made me realise that mellow drama and melodrama sound basically the same but mean basically the opposite thing, and I think that's nifty", "And now she wants to make his death all about herself.", "That's a nice way to put it. I would have used some other words to describe her.... NTA.", "When my Mum told me my Nan was terminal, I asked whether she wanted me to tell my sister or if she wanted to do it herself. I would not just go ahead and tell other people without being given leave to do so.", "This makes the most sense to me. She got aggrieved at HOW she was told, so she stayed away from the funeral to guilt OP, and it backfired because OP didn't even think of it."]}
