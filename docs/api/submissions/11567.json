Now that pretty much everyone in my family thinks I'm horrendous, I wanted an outside opinion.\n\nMy husband passed away recently after a very sudden and difficult struggle with cirrhosis. It was easily the worst thing to happen in my life. The damage was invisible for years, we never saw it coming. He got so sick, so fast. After they diagnosed him, he lived a little over a year.\nWe called all our family, including his mother, who otherwise we don't have much contact with. I've always hated that woman. She has always been cruel to him, put him down every chance she could. When we called saying her son was terminally ill, she first denied it, insisted we were lying. Then she went on about how we should've seen this coming, that this is just what happens when you're a drunk. Of course this shut down the call pretty fast. She only called once after that, and we didn't pick up.\nA little over a year later, I had to bring him to the hospital and in two days, he was gone. At that point, he was already just so confused and hardly conscious. I told my parents and his brothers, and we were the last people to see him.\nI wasn't doing very well at the time either, everything just happened so fast. I wasn't ready to make any of those decisions, and between the doctors and the bills and just seeing him so sick, I didn't even think about his mother. In the days after, I just didn't want to deal with her. I know that's horrible, but I was just so tired. \n\nShe called me a few weeks later, I'm not sure how she heard. She was hysterical, which I know is understandable. She said I robbed her of saying goodbye to her son, and robbed him of a proper service. I should have just hung up, but I was so hurt and so angry. I informed her a very nice service was held, which every important person in his life was there. I said she must be mistaken and blocked her number.\nShe's gone ballistic. Called my brother in laws in tears about how I've ruined her life, gone on facebook about how devastated she is and publicly begging me to talk to her, how she just wants his things and to know what happened.\nEven my parents said it wasn't my place to make that choice for my husband, and I should try to talk with her.\n\nI know I probably should. I know he was hers before he was mine. But she made him miserable, and if he had been able to choose, I know he wouldn't have wanted her there. I don't think she deserved to see him, and I don't think she deserves to have any of the things that were his.\nBut now that I write it all out, it really sounds horrible. Maybe I'm out of line to make that call. The only people who haven't said I was being cruel are my husband's two brothers, who know how she can be.\n\nBut other than them, she was the only family he had.

Notice how she's going public with this story of being \"robbed\" of her time with him. The only thing she was robbed of was the narcissistic supply she would have gotten from turning his deathbed and funeral into a dramatic scene for herself.\n\nYou did what you had to do to protect yourself and your husband. Given her past treatment of him and of you, she was not entitled to that time with him, and she was not entitled a stage to engage in her display of mourning. Her behaviour since his death has only reinforced that you made the right choice.\n\nNotice how your husband's brothers, the people who knew your husband and mother best, are adamant in saying you are NTA? It's only the people who don't understand just how bad she is who question your choice. Don't doubt that you made the right choice. Don't let her get her narcissistic supply from you. You did what was best for everyone involved, and that includes her by failing to give her a platform she wanted to hurt others.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and I hope you have the support you need in your time of grief. Don't doubt that you made the best choice available to you.", "You said she has 2 other sons, didn't they inform her about your husband? Wtf?", "NTA.

This right here:\n\n>The only people who haven't said I was being cruel are my husband's two brothers\n\nis pretty telling.  If she'd wanted a \"proper goodbye\", she had a year to try and make amends; she can't claim after the fact that she suddenly cares.", "As someone who\u2019s only low-contact with their parents now, but has a living will just so the people in my life wont have to deal with them when i die, NTA. If he wasnt interested in talking with her during the year, there\u2019s no reason for you to assume she would\u2019ve been invited to his death bed had he been in complete control of his faculties. \n\nOne of the last thing she said to her dying son was that he was a drunk. I think its absolutely reasonable for her invitation to a funeral to be revoked after that, as well, so i think you\u2019re totally in the right.", "NTA  - she is toxic.   Blood doesn't equal family.   People who have been abused understand this.", "NTA", "She made him miserable, she called him names, and your husband wouldn\u2019t have wanted her there if he had been able to choose. \n\nRead that back to yourself and know that you\u2019re NTA. \n\nSome people have been lucky enough to have different parents and will literally not understand your reasoning but you didn\u2019t need to tell her and your BILs didn\u2019t have to tell her. Her knowing would have brought her around to make you miserable at the worst time in your life. \n\nYour husband chose to live the end of his life without contacting her and you are completely in the right to continue that after his death.", "NTA\n\nBlood related means nothing, you can choose your family. She showed her true colours and narcissists are always the victims in their own reality. Your husband already had no contact before he was sick. She had a whole year to mend that relationship and instead did nothing. Let her and the rest of his family live with this. Cut them out and heal with the ones who mattered to you and to your hubby. Also sorry for your loss", "NTA. As others have stated, she was told. She could have hopped in a car and drove over, sent a letter etc. she did none of this \n\nYou also told your brothers in law.  They is your husband\u2019s family do you notified his family. It was up to them to inform their mother.  They didn\u2019t.  Is she not implicating them in anything? I\u2019m sure not as you say, they know what she is like. But it is your defence. \n\nI think it is very telling that she wants some of his things. Perhaps this is about money?", "Info: how come she didn\u2019t find out of his passing from one of her other sons?", "NTA. Your husband did not contact her in his last year, I would say he made his choice about who was important to him and who wasn\\`t, you just followed through with it.", "NTA.  NTA.  Ignore those calling you an AH.  They have *never* had a toxic person in their family, and it is inconceivable to them a toxic familial relationship exists.  If his *brothers* don\u2019t think you\u2019re in AH, they would know, better than the vapid YTA responses on Reddit.", "NTA.  I\u2019ll tell you what, I would want my daughter in law to know she could lean on me when the worst thing is happening.  \n\nShe\u2019s a grown woman. She created this relationship and these are the consequences.", "NTA, her treatment of your beloved husband made her a person of not worthy.   \nIf she wanted to be within your family, she could just as well have been a better human. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did tell her, you never ever said she'd like it. Place a wildflower on his grave for me, will ya? You did good OP, and you've lost someone. Don't feel guilt over that vile woman.", "NTA. Had she been involved in his life until his death, she would have known. His brothers were, and they didn't bother to tell her he was dying or dead, so that tells you all you need to know. Keep her blocked.", "This, she let the brothers know. At that point, it's in the hands of family, and OP didn't feel familial with MIL. NTA.", "My ex husband and I have remained very close over the years mainly because of our two boys. I intensely disliked his mother and had nothing whatsoever to do with her after the divorce. A couple of years ago he had a malignant growth on one of his kidneys and consequently had to have it removed. He was very ill. His mother was still alive at that point but I don\u2019t believe he ever told her. Had he died, I would have found it extremely difficult to talk to that woman. I probably would have found someone to do it for me. So I know just how OP feels. Unless you have ever been in that situation, you can\u2019t possibly judge someone for their actions.", "Being married means it is a spouse\u2019s place to make decisions.

The fact that they didn't speaks volumes.", "Why is it on widow??? Why should her other sons, who know exactly what's happening, not be responsible for letting her know??? If they don't want her there either, she was obviously a pretty shit parent. You don't get to behave like she did when OP/husband made contact after his diagnosis, and then act all butt hurt once it's too late to actually try and make up for being a shit parent.", "I think it is more horrible to tell a dying person it is their fault they are dying and I think with that a person loses every right to feel left out or hurt.", "You're looking at this the wrong way. The husband's brothers didn't tell her either. I couldn't imagine being such a monster that my own children didn't think I should be at my child's funeral", "The last time they called her about him dying she accused them of lying and said that it was his fault anyway. I would not risk to make that phone call, god knows what she would have had to listen to then.", "THIS.", "You said it before I could. This is the only thing that matters, right here. \nPeriod. \nDone. \n\nFocus on your own grief and healing, OP. Your awful MIL made her own bed.  Feel free to ignore her very existence. \nNTA.", "Well, his brothers knew as well and were also at the funeral, so either of them could have informed the mom.", "They were no contact for the year he was dying, were they not?", "Not talking for a year before he died sounds like no contact to me.", "I missed this the first time I read but yeah, they knew and didn\u2019t tell mum, likely for good reason.  OP is NTA.", "100% this. I went with \u201cself centered\u201d but she sounds like any narcissist I\u2019ve ever met and her reaction as well as none of her other kids informing her of their brother\u2019s passing says all I need to know.", "Her own sons, who were there, didn\u2019t tell her. \n\nNTA", "He did not contact her once in the year he was dying, how much more no contact can there be?", "This was my thought as well.", "That's what I was wondering. If other members of the family were involved, why did they omit the info? Why was it entirely on her to inform his mother and not the brothers?", "Maybe they hate her too.", "Really, they've been the only people on my side with any of this. They helped me plan the funeral and really did their best to keep her out of it. They don't talk to her much more than we do, so it wasn't hard to keep her away from things. It was really devastating for all of us, and I guess we each just figured someone else would tell her. Now that she knows and finally wants to be a part of things, they are about as enthused as I am.\nShe has never been a good mother, but I fucked up her last chance to try.", "Tbh, his brothers were there when he died and none of them let their mother know, so i guess they agreed with op", "Makes me think they've also gone next to no contact with her which raises the question if she's horrificly abusive to them too", "Not to mention, the brothers feel she was in the right.", "And her own son's didn't tell her......", "Although that's true, I don't trust the narrative", "Totally agree with both of you.", "You didn\u2019t fuck up her last chance to try, she did, when you told her he had a year and she got all bitchy about it and didn\u2019t bother.

She did that by herself.\n\nNTA", "If 2 brothers didn't tell their own mother about their brother/her son passing away, I'm not sure why would be on you (the wife) to do it.  It seems like every argument that you should had done it, applies to 2 other people with even an expected closer relationships to the mother (and potentially the brother). At most, it seems to be something that unfortunately slipped through the cracks.\n\nNTA.  I hope you feel better.", "Sweetheart, a lot of this is the grief talking. It does really bizarre things to your brain, the chemicals are all up and down and mixed about, and on top of that I'm willing to bet you haven't had much sleep recently.\n\nYour husband was given a diagnosis a year ago. That was a whole 12 months for him to put his affairs in order and make his wishes known. If he had wanted his mother to have his things, he would have said. If he wanted more contact with her, then he would have said.\n\nThe fact that his own brothers didn't, at any point while he was in hospital, go \"I know you don't want to hear this OP, but we should call Mum so she can say goodbye\" speaks volumes. She may have brought him into this world, but from the sounds of it she was, if not abusive, then downright unpleasant and thus sarificed the right to see him leave this world. She had plenty of chances to see him and make the most of the time he had left. Instead she chose to call both of you liars and barely reached out at any point during his final year. Those are not the actions of a loving mother.\n\nYour parents are saying what they're saying because they don't have the same experience of dealing with a toxic family member. It is very easy to say \"Of course you should have called\" or \"Of course you need to give in to her demands\" when they don't really affect you. That doesn't mean you have to go along with what they say.\n\nYour husband knew that you loved him. You promised him \"in sickness and in health\" and you delivered. You have done everything possible for him. Now it is time to focus on you. Take care of yourself, block those (and stay off social media) who have no idea what the past 12 months were really like. Set boundaries with those you want in your life but who maybe aren't giving you the best advice. You are still right at the beginning of your grief, above all else be king to yourself and try to dismiss the little brain gremlins who aren't being your friend at the moment.", "She fucked up her last chance. Not you."]}
