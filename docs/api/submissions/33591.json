{"id": 33591, "submission_id": "18oo58k", "title": "AITA for refusing to change LGBTQ elements of my book for my Uncle's book group?", "selftext": "I published my first book a few weeks ago. It's self-published so I have been reaching out to family and friends for ways to sell it and local ways to get it out there. \n\nMy Uncle \"Bill\" read the book and said he really liked it and wanted me to share it with his book group. This group is mostly 40+ age folks who love sci-fi and fantasy novels, so it fits their demographic perfectly. It's over 50 people with a couple of online book bloggers with some decent following, so I thought it was a huge stroke of luck and a great opportunity.\n\nThen after I agreed and started to plan for a date to go, he said that he wanted me to change some things first. I was reluctant, but he pointed out how I could make a different ebook version for them and possibly other customers and reach a different audience. I'm always open to improving, so I asked what changes he wanted. \n\nTurns out his suggestions all involve removing LGBTQ elements from my book. I didn't think there was much to begin with, but evidently having a lesbian starship pilot, a princess who isn't interested in romance/marriage, and a race of reptilian warriors who could choose their own gender at adolescence was too \"gay\" for his group.\n\nPutting aside the monumental efforts I have taken to edit my book already, I liked those characters and aspects the way they were and I wasn't interested in changing them just to get my book more exposure. \n\nBill was pissed. He said that he already told many of his friends in the group about the event and that he would look like a fool if I backed out on him. (I guess canceling events is a big deal for them). I told him that he could either let me present my book the way it was with no changes to the characters, or he could find another author/book to present to his group.\n\nMembers of my family have approached me and said that I am overreacting. That my own ego and self-importance for my writing were causing problems for Bill and that changing my book didn't need to be such a big deal. I tried to say that I was open to toning down the violence or the one intimate scene in the book, but they said that one change is no different than the other and I should be open to what Bill wants.\n\n As offended as I am at the prospect, I worry that they might be right. I know authors have a bad reputation for reacting badly to criticism or believing their work is \"perfect\" and I try hard not to fall into that.\n\nAm I wrong? Am I overreacting to this?", "created_utc": 1703276965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oo58k/aita_for_refusing_to_change_lgbtq_elements_of_my/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And let\u2019s be honest here: your uncle is asking you to change your book to make it acceptable to homophobes. And your family, by saying you are overreacting, are supporting homophobia.", "Nta at all.  You never need to cave to bigotry. Tell your uncle if he wants a version of his dream book so bad, he can write it himself, but if he takes a copy of yours and edits it, you are definitely going to contact legal support.", "NTA - if he wants to present your book to his book group he needs to present it as it's been published or not at all. Editing is already a massive effort, never mind creating edits to appeal to people's prejudices.", "NTA.  Tell him that he didn't want the book you actually wrote, and you weren't going to write a new version just for him.", "NTA\n\nIt's very weird to ask that you change many of the characters for little reason.

It's criticism of content. \n\nIt's not your problem your book is deemed to \"gay\" for the group. They are perfectly free to not read it. What they are not free to do is to demand changes to things that make them uncomfortable.\n\nTell the folks saying your \"ego\" and \"self importance\" are the problem to take a hike.", "If this group is reading any modern sci fi at ALL, they are surely reading many stories with overt or underlying tones regarding gender and sexuality.

That's really cool stuff. Your uncle would implode reading it.\n\n It uses gender neutral pronouns for characters of unknown gender.

Didn't learn to read just to fill my head with more voices like my own.", "NTA regardless of how you chose to handle it. You have quite a dilemma for sure. Making the changes will mean you sell a bunch of copies to the book club people at the expense of compromising your hard work and worse, caving in to pressure from your uncle. It is never good to cave to bigotry but on the other hand, you\u2019re also trying to sell something and it has to appeal to the buyers to get them to buy and say good things. But on the other other hand, your uncle might be the only person in the group with a problem and it\u2019s very possible many readers would appreciate the LGBTQ content and that the others wouldn\u2019t care. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I believe you made the right decision.", "Bill can write his own fucking book if he wants, NTA", "NTA.

You shouldn't have to change any part of your work for anyone else, especially if it's absolutely harmless like that. If any your uncle is TA here cuz uh.. Why's he asking for that all to be removed?? What's his issue with it, or rather why does he have an issue with it? Because he shouldn't..", "Don't back down.

I'd love to read your book!", "I am currently only reading fantasy books with lesbians in them.", "NTA.  With all due respect you spent months (years?)
