I don't have the best relationship with my MIL as she always seem to police what I eat.\n\nEveryone in my family have fast metabolism, I am also working with horses so due to this burn a lot of calories (talking about 2.5-3k a day) and usually have rather large meals to get the energy back and I still remain skinny.\n\nNow to the event. My in-laws invited me and Nate for dinner last Friday. I was very busy back then and haven't eaten since about 6-7am and also didn't have a chance to have a snack before heading to the restaurant so I was starving (I usually have something to eat before seeing my MIL to avoid her comments). Due to this I have ordered a large steak at the restaurant which was meant for 2 people, it also came with prawns, bacon and 2 sides. Please note it was not the most expensive item on the menu as some of my in laws had significantly pricier dishes and we were all splitting the bill anyway.\n\nMy MIL started making comments how I shouldn't be ordering what I can't eat since even her husband wouldn't be able to finish the dish, let alone someone my size. I smiled and said I haven't eaten since early morning and am starving, if I don't finish the steak I will take the leftovers home.\n\nI have easily finished the steak and was waiting for my dessert, when my MIL flipped. She said I am attention seeking and was putting on a show, she also said I have made my FIL and BIL feel uneasy and that a woman shouldn't eat that much, it is unhealthy and something is wrong with me. She has then demanded me and Nate to cover the entire bill as she wasn't planning on \"such a big expenditure\". I said we are absolutely not covering the entire bill since it was meant to be split equally and reminded her of the dishes she ordered, that were significantly more expensive compared to my steak (including her starter). As a result I was called an asshole who has ruined a family dinner.\n\nNate is on my side but most of my in-laws are making very passive aggressive posts on social media about it and keep sending me different articles of \"what might cause excessive eating\".", "created_utc": 1690794134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15eari2/aita_for_ordering_a_giant_steak_against_my_mil/", "score": 19528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I ate half (about 6\u201d) figured she might want a bite or two as well and I could save the rest for work the next day. She put down her whole snack and ate all of the rest of my sandwich. I wasn\u2019t even mad about the no leftovers, just proud.", "I think best way to phrase it too; it's poor manners too comment on what other people are eating or argue about the bill with the table. These are the basics, because when ya break those rules it leads to ~~people knowing how mean and insane you are~~ this sort of situation", "What? You should try closing your eyes and stuffing your hands in your partner's plate to make sure it's different.", "Based on other comments on here from OP, the husband does stand up to his mom without issue (and did so in this incident).", "100!! Silence is compliance. This once happened to my wife via my aunt in front of a lot of our family one year. I promptly told her to mind her own dinner or eat elsewhere. I was called rude and an asshole by some but I\u2019ve never been questioned openly by any family member since and more importantly it made my wife feel supported.", "Exactly, I really wish more people could recognise the \"silence is complicity\" phrase that's being used as a weapon lately has some definite flaws.", "Yep. Treating you to dinner out is basically a mandatory invitation to compromise, instead of getting what you really wanted to eat. It sucks.", "Do you have any recent-ish references you could share? The real thing, pubmed. (Pretty nearly everything in the media isn\u2019t worth the time it takes to figure out whether it\u2019s legit, though if you have something you know is valid I\u2019ll take it.)\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this is what is going on with my husband. He\u2019s gotten his weight under better control than ever, but now he\u2019s cold all the time. He\u2019s happy about his success and I\u2019m happy for him, but 80 degrees is simply not a comfortable sleeping temperature. \n\nWe are both biologists but this is more my area than his and my info is out of date. He does move a lot, both workouts and around the house, so we need to look past simple movement. So scholarly references on basal thermigenesis would be really helpful.", "Someone please find the Bobby Hill clip!", "It was an early morning, pre-coffee writing prompt from the gods. The MIL is so off-base here that it warranted extreme shit posting.", "She was probably jealous as well. I can eat a lot as well and I usually do. Fast metabolism and 15.000-20.000 steps a day. \nI've noticed in several instances that people don't really like the amount of food I eat. Even when it's 'healthy' food (for example there is this burger restaurant where I really like the one salad you can order as a side so I order that instead of the usual fries) \nBut as soon as I eat more than them they're always like \"oh I gain weight just by looking at you eating\" \"isn't that a bit much? You'll gain weight\" \nAnd they always look extremely pissed when I answer that I always eat like this and that I haven't gained weight in years. \nThey're unhappy with themselves and let it out on others\nMen are generally cool about it", "Exactly what I thought. They were expecting their DIL to subsidize their excesses, not to break even by inviting her.", "I\u2019m thinking this probably extends to her choice of careers - like altogether it renders OP not feminine enough in MIL\u2019s eyes.\n\nPeople are so weird.  The parents of a guy I dated once disapproved of me because I teach college - his dad once said \u201cI understand you can\u2019t take back all that time you wasted on unnecessary education, but you could at least teach high school.\u201d  The guy at least Eason my side on that, but he did seem to have an inferiority complex over it.  He ultimately dumped me because I didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d him for anything, and now has a wife who is happy to be taken care of and bat her eyelashes at her big man.", "Yes. It\u2019s pretty dependent on body composition, your mental health, and your activity level. Which can have a clear genetic link. It makes sense for youngins to eat more because of their growing bodies, and it makes sense that people with more muscle require more food, even while at a resting state. Your metabolism and the rate it burns through calories doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum (but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a lazy potato just because your body has went through changes while your eating habits remained steady, causing you to gain weight. This stuff is complex and confusing).\n\nI learned that I didn\u2019t actually have a \u201cfast metabolism\u201d. I had untreated ADHD and would binge eat because I\u2019d forget to eat lol. I\u2019d out eat everyone because I was starving. It made it seem that I ate a lot more than I actually did. People would look on in wonder as the skinniest girl ate the most food. Glad I never experienced the BS the OP went through.", "\\-dies laughing-", "Me too \ud83e\udd23", "Eats shoots and leaves!", "Nate should have said, mother, for God's sake, STFU!", ">MIL was probably brought up to only eat salad\n\nWell, MIL has ditched her upbringing by now, since she ordered starters and whatever dish on the menu that costs more than OP's steak.\n\nI think MIL just wanted to splurge on someone else's dime, and thought OP would roll over passively.", "as someone who has a slow metabolism but loves food i am indeed insanely jealous lmfao", "Nevertheless, she persisted.", "Rides to her happily ever after, Western style, tipping her hat to the waiter", "\u201cShe eats a double-portion of steak alone. He\u2019s just Ken.\u201d", "Gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you masculinity is dead. It was simply too fragile to handle a woman eating a large steak. It's only a matter of time before our penises and testicles are pulled into our bodies and turned into ovaries and vaginas.", "He needs to tell her your eating habits are not her damn business and if she continues to push the misogyny on her then yall will no longer be eating with them.", "Op said it would have cost less if her and her husband paid for just their meal. So, mil is more of an asshat than I thought.", "My girlfriend is 5\u201910\u201d weighs 118 lbs and eats two dinners when we go out. I have 50 pounds on her and sometimes don\u2019t finish my food.", "Right so since the MIL dish is obviously more expensive, they should order what she orders next time, to the dime. That way the \u201cequal split\u201d is actually equal. And MIL has to \u201cgo suck eggs\u201d and pay for her food.", "\u2026I didn\u2019t say they should. I said the MIL was right about the FIL and BILs having an issue with what OP ordered instead of MIL saying it and them not speaking up to say they weren\u2019t."]}
