He does pretty good in school, and most of teachers have nothing but good things to say about him. Apparently one of his teachers asked him for help catching some kids cheating. The teacher left some fake test answers on his desk, and pretended to go to the bathroom. Our son then showed as many people the answers as possible, before the teacher came back in. Then he helped the teacher indentify who had looked at telhe answers.\n\nWe only heard about this a couple weeks after the fact. Apparently said teacher got into some trouble, because more than half your students failing an exam looks bad for you as well as them. It was only then that our son revealed the part he played, and that some kids at school are angry at him for helping the teacher.\n\nI told him that while kids shouldn't be giving him trouble about that, and I'd help stop it if need be, he shouldn't be surprised. I told him he doesn't always need to suck up to authority, and 5 extra points on the test wasn't worth getting 16 other people in trouble. He argued they got themselves in trouble, but I still said he didn't need to help.\n\nI basically explained that to the other kids, including his friends, he's saying that he respects the teacher more than he respects them. Nobody will ever trust him after he lied like that. He thought I'd be proud of him, but not for that, all he did was lie to sell out his friends.\n\nMy wife is on his side, and thinks we should be happy he helped enforce the rules.

Worse, the teacher enlisted one of the students in this scam.  And the student was stupid enough to play along.  The mother agreeing with this crap?

It traps people who otherwise might not be tempted to misbehave.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see what your son could've done in the moment.
