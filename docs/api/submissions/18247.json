Then he helped the teacher indentify who had looked at telhe answers.\n\nWe only heard about this a couple weeks after the fact. Apparently said teacher got into some trouble, because more than half your students failing an exam looks bad for you as well as them. It was only then that our son revealed the part he played, and that some kids at school are angry at him for helping the teacher.\n\nI told him that while kids shouldn't be giving him trouble about that, and I'd help stop it if need be, he shouldn't be surprised. I told him he doesn't always need to suck up to authority, and 5 extra points on the test wasn't worth getting 16 other people in trouble. He argued they got themselves in trouble, but I still said he didn't need to help.\n\nI basically explained that to the other kids, including his friends, he's saying that he respects the teacher more than he respects them. Nobody will ever trust him after he lied like that. He thought I'd be proud of him, but not for that, all he did was lie to sell out his friends.\n\nMy wife is on his side, and thinks we should be happy he helped enforce the rules.

Worse, the teacher enlisted one of the students in this scam.  And the student was stupid enough to play along.  The mother agreeing with this crap?

It traps people who otherwise might not be tempted to misbehave.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see what your son could've done in the moment.

Frankly, one of the dumbest things about American culture is the stigma against \"tattling\". If there is a cheating problem, your son should absolutely help the authorities against the cheaters. That's not \"sucking up\" to authority, that's just basic civic responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, the teacher sucks they didn't just bait, they had your son actively entrap the other students.\n\nYour son sucks for the same reason, as the active participant in the entrapment scheme.\n\nAnd your wife also sucks because she is unable to distinguish \"reporting cheaters\" and \"actively entrap people into cheating\".", "It\u2019s textbook entrapment. \n\nKid is not a good person.

Frankly, the teacher should be fired for this.", "It's such a weird story. It doesn't sound like the kids were even planning to cheat originally, they just took the opportunity because the teacher put it there and their snitch of a classmate egged them on. This didn't uncover anything; it's a situation of the teacher's own creation!", "Seriously... they didn't \"catch cheaters\". They baited people and he lured them in.", "This exactly, I don't blame you OP for thinking that way, you told your son as it is, he's lost the trust of his entire class because of this and that's really bad.

I would be complaining to the principal, and readying a case for the school board and the superintendent. Because if the cheating is *so* rampant that *this* seemed necessary, this teacher is *clearly* failing on *multiple* fronts.", "I'd report the teacher.

Authority is important, but not when abusing it.", "I absolutely agree with you!", "This", "Are we going to ignore that the teacher left their class unattended for a stupid stunt?

OP\u2019s son actively participated in entrapping kids. \n\nThere are some people that wouldn\u2019t try to cheat but with peer pressure, group think, and possibly being shown the answers would do so. If that. \n\nBased on the way they went about it there is no real way to guarantee all those people actually \u201ccheated.\u201d Just because someone looks at something someone puts in their face doesn\u2019t mean they cheated. \n\nI think OP is right in this case that the son went too far and it does sound like he sold out his friends for 5 extra points. Yes, you want to respect authority but loyalty matters too. Sounds like the son gets good enough grades on his own.", "This is a bit of an edge situation.\n\nI came to the thread expecting to say exactly what you did, but in this case there was entrapment.\n\nPlenty of kids might take a look to not seem lame but not use or think about it. Ethically iffy, but these are 15/16 year olds and the bit where the teacher asked him to encourage the other kids to do so makes me feel weird about the whole situation.", "The kid needs to understand that this wasn't worth it.  He's not 'catching bad guys'.  He's pandering to some ridiculous teacher and their entrapment scheme.  \n\nThe whole thing is insane, and the teacher is the biggest AH of all.  But to say the OP is an AH for not being proud of it is ridiculous.  \n\nIf I were OP I would be pissed at the teacher for taking advantage on my son like that, and frustrated that the son didn't properly identify the numerous reasons why he should have said no to it.", "There is no integrity in the way the son and teacher went about this scheme of entrapment.

When those kids find out about what his son did, he will be bullied severely.", "it\u2019s not academic integrity though, he also had access to the answers and he pushed others to look then they got in trouble and he gets off scot-free. this would be different had they not specifically engineered the situation to catch people.", "I never understood this mentality of, it doesn\u2019t fit my world view of probability therefor it is 100% false. These sort of rigid snap-judgments can\u2019t be healthy.", "The thing is, how many of that kids would realy cheat, if he didn't show them the answers?

I get that the kid thought he was doing a right thing, but the teacher is just an AH.", "I guess just not agree to do it?", "she doesn\u2019t, this wasn\u2019t just him catching people cheating, he trapped them and was the root of the issues, we don\u2019t know if those students would\u2019ve cheated had he not outright shown them the answers. he is absolutely not neutral in this situation and the only reason he is exempt from the punishment is because the teacher can\u2019t admit that she used him for her plan. disrespecting authority is okay when they are in the wrong. all this did was make him a target at school and the teacher got in trouble so who knows how that class will go for him now. there is absolutely nothing to be proud of", "One thing would be, if the kids cheated on the test by communicating with each other, or they prepared answers somewhere to look at them during the test.

We don't how many of them would realy cheat on their own and how many of them were just curious or did what the rest of the kids did.\n\nHowever, I don't think OP's son is an AH here, the only AH is the teacher who prepared the trap and convinced OP's son to play a part in it.", "The kid was obeying an authority figure after 15 years of being taught and to do so.", "It's entrapment", "Yeah isn't this called like entrapment or something?

Bc IF the other kids hadn\u2019t looked, but then reported the son as the cheater, then what? \n\nBet teacher would\u2019ve backstabbed her accomplice. \n\nEither way, the teacher got someone to blame. \n\nFurthermore, she BRIBED your son with free points he didn\u2019t earn on a test. \n\nSooo entrapment, bribery, false grading\u2026..\ud83e\udd14 anything else?", "This is what I was thinking too. Weird flex from the teacher.", "this! they engineered a situation to catch out people for seemingly no reason. and the son had access to this test the same as everyone but he didn\u2019t get any of the same repercussions. he\u2019s lucky all the flack he\u2019s getting is from his parents because this issue could become far bigger if other students and their parents catch on", "I remember something similar happened at school where a teacher honestly accidentally left a test out before going to the bathroom. People passed it around.\n\nI was the type of student who got straight A\u2019s without studying. I had no need to cheat but I still looked (without *really* reading though) because who wants to single themselves out as the stick in the mud in that situation? Plus if I planned on informing the teacher (or someone else did before me) I didn\u2019t want to look like a potential snitch.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely entrapment. I guarantee some of those students who looked would not have normally been inclined to look.
