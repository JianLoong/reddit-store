My wife and I have done things 50-50 for years now. Recently she has been suggesting we do things more equitably, being as I earn far more than she does. I like to keep things simple, I already deal with enough complexity at work, the last thing I want is to deal with more complexity in our personal finances. \n\nShe feels it is unfair, and I should pay a larger overall percentage of house hold expenses. Thing is, we only split the mortgage, utilities, homeowners insurance, household needs, and general / emergency nest egg. We each have our own retirement plans, we are responsible for our own debt and expenses such as credit cards, student loans, car insurance, car payments, and personal miscellaneous spending. \n\nHer reasoning is logically sound, I do earn more and I also have less in terms of reoccurring expenses. My car is paid off so I just have insurance and gas to worry about. My student loans are paid off, and I have no credit card debt. I have the means to cover more without having a negative impact on myself or the household. \n\nEmotionally, it just does not sit right with me. As I explained yes, I could cover a larger portion to give you a break, but I tried to explain to her the reason she is struggling is due to her own personal choices. She did not need to buy a car with an $750 car payment, she did not have to make the choice to go to a school that is 50k a year. She can choose to live within her means, and spend less on personal luxuries. As explained why should I cover for expenses she accrued not due to need but want?\n\nMy wife feels as her husband I should want to help her if I have the means and I am simply letting her struggle to prove a point. Again she is correct to a degree, I do want her to learn from her actions. I asked my dad for his opinion, and he told me and I quote; \"Happy wife, happy life.\" He suggested I should help her out. It makes no financial sense to have her struggle when you can take much of the burden off. He even suggested I go one step further and help her pay off her debt. \n\nMy wife told me I am being overly selfish and slightly self serving. My father, while he did not outwardly say anything I could tell he felt I am being petty and pedantic. I do not think things are exactly small errors, but overall in the grand scheme I can see why he may see it as such.", "created_utc": 1693070944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16216ul/aita_for_wanting_to_split_things_equally_and_not/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's contributing 50% of her income towards the costs that you are both equally responsible for, but you is only contributing 12.5% of your paycheck towards those costs (if I've divided right). This allows you to save/reinvest a greater proportion of your income. That's not an equal division. Joint expenses should be split based on how much you each get paid *regardless* of how much debt either of you have. \n\nWhat are your wife's other expenditures besides car (very much in the wrong) and student loans (in my opinion, not in the wrong, although you should not be on the hook for contributing to paying them off)? Are there other luxuries involved here? \n\n> All me covering does is just give her more play money.\n\nThis is an entirely different problem. You're saying here that if you split joint expenses on income, your wife would not cover more of her necessary expenses or her debt, but would instead spend on fun items unrelated to her current costs. If that's the case, that's a completely different problem you have.", "He said he tried to give her financial advice early in their relationship and she ignored it. Sounds like he is punishing her for not listening to his wisdom.", "I have a payment of that much cuz someone crashed into me when there was a chip shortage and totaled my car \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'm in TX and NEED cooled seats.", "Not at all reasonable. \n\nMy husband and I both got new cars within the last year and combined our payments aren\u2019t $750/mo.", "So it\u2019s okay for you to have \u201cplay money\u201d, but heaven forfend she does?", "If you feel like that about her and have that little confidence, you should probably not be married. Do you even like your wife?", "Glossed right over the very perfunctory question of \u201cdo you even like your wife?\u201d And I would love the OP to actually answer that question. \n\nYTA, BTW.", "So if this is your concern, then sit down and have a conversation.  You're willing to to pay X amount more towards your joint bills, as long as she uses that extra money to pay down her school loans or pay extra on her car.   My fianc\u00e9' and I split joint expenses 60/40, which comes out to about $200 a month that he pays more and I pay less.  I take that $200 that I'm \"saving\" and add it to the amount I pay for my student loans. I don't have $200 more spending money, I have enough money to double my payment to my own debt and get rid of it faster.    Having less debt as a legally married couple, even if that debt is in her name, is a net positive for both of you.", "Why are you married?", "This isn\u2019t about debt. This is about a fair and equal balance of joint expenses according to income. YTA.", "Going to university is not exactly a frivolous expense", "Look, that has nothing to do with the actual question. Splitting expenses based on income is fairest to everybody. Even if she was frugal, it would still be the right thing to do. It's not a bailout, it's your fair share. \n\nThe question of her debt and spending habits is a separate issue and one she needs to figure out. But she's sure as hell not going to feel motivated to work collaboratively with you on budgeting while you're insisting she pays a higher share of her income for your collective lifestyle.", "why are you even married?", "what is the difference in earning ratio?\n\nDo you earn 3X what she does or more?  And how much has that changed over the years?\n\nYou say she does not need to work.  If she quite her job, would you take over the payments for her car, school debt, etc?", "Ok,but how much more would she cost you if she divorced you?", "She probably could also spend less on her credit cards if she had more money every month for expenses. \n\nHow much is her interest? How long will it actually take her to pay of $300,000 in debt plus interest? Do YOU want to be shackled to that kind debt? \n\nAgain, do you care about your partner at all? Or is she just a roommate?", "Could she also keep up us she only paid about I come proportional amount of joint household expenses?", "Why? Because you love her and want her to be happier? Right? \n\nHonestly it\u2019s sounds like you don\u2019t even like her. Or your a 4 yr old who wants to make others suffer.", "Why? Because you love her maybe, and you can afford to help. It's a partnership and each should contribute according to their means. You truly are an uncaring husband. \n\nRegardless of her debt, she should pay less when it comes to utilities/shared things, it only makes sense. \n\nHow would you feel if you had an accident due to something potentially dangerous that you decided to do? Maybe something like riding a bike after she warned you it could be dangerous. Then she would tell you she won't help you with your recovery because it's something you chose to do and you're on your own. This is what you're doing. I would never treat my partner like that.", "If you have to think about whether you hurt your wife (it\u2019s very clear to us that you have hurt her) then you have bigger problems. Do you love your wife..? Sincere question", "Do you ever use her car?", "Which is why considering counseling as a couple would be real wise if you want want to actually address this issue cleanly.", "Then renegotiate to 65%/35% split. If you've been enforcing a 50/50 split before, I don't see why you can't change the amount but keep enforcing it.", "You haven\u2019t said one kind thing about her. You\u2019re speaking ill of her logic - but yours sucks too. Like a lot.", "She enjoys shopping and maintaining a certain image. I get the logic behind it but at the same time, she is not proposing this because it is fair. I know my wife, she is a give an inch take a mile type. I have tried to help her budget but never went anywhere which is why we we choose to do things the way we are. \n\nShe wanted control of her money and did not want someone to be watching how she spent. For us to go based on income instead of an even split I believe we should be mindful of everything counting fun money. She will never agree to that. I know how she thinks it starts with this, then she will still be struggling she will want me to cover her debt also. Her struggle will always be a thing until she is debt free.", "Who could possibly be skeptical about \"financial advice\" which buries the lede about exploitations of others, including supposed loved ones, and starting out from privilege?", "She is in the spot cause she charged so much for her fun things.", "I know my wife. We agreed to do things this way for a reason. She has always been bad with money. I tried to help, but cannot change someone that does not want to change.", "It kind of is, she is struggling to pay what we agreed upon because of her debt.", "About 4x times what she currently makes. If she stopped working by choice I would cover her student loans not sure what I would do with the car or her debt. A lot of her credit card debt is personal luxuries clothes, jewelry, shoes, and eating out for lunch. Stuff like that.\n\nShe did not need to buy such an expensive car.\n\nWhen we got married we spoke about it, she wanted to work so she had her own money to spend.", "Asking the real questions.", "It's cheaper to keep her.", "This is my line of thinking. You know the person will not change, that is an aspect of their personality you love for better or for worse. \n\nNow say I covered more now, she is not going to change her spending habits. She will keep spending outside her means. The only way to stop her from \"suffering\" is to eliminate all her debt and cover everything moving forward and letting her use her money however she sees fit.", "There is obviously a part in you that judges her for spending and thinks this type of spending should be punished with some sort of consequence. We all have those parts and it's normal, but if you continue to just let it happen, it can really put your relationship at risk \n\nRight now you are not coming from a place of love and support for your partner but from that part instead.\n\nI'd suggest that rather than \"fighting\" with us about what you are doing (cause most of us here are really just telling you that it's not okay and you continue to try to tell us that it is), you spend some time with that part and find out what it is trying to do and why.\n\nIdeas:\nWas this a value that was instilled in you as a child? Did either of your parents sometimes shame you for wanting things that they considered extravagant? Maybe you wanted ice cream every second day and they without thinking made some comments that child-you interpreted as \"spoiling yourself is bad\"\nOr did you have (perceived) financial insecurities in your childhood and are therefore more frugal with your spending? \n\nThose are just examples and you have to find out for yourself what the root of this is, but consider that whatever it is, it's likely a belief you formed to protect yourself as a child. I think the moment you accept that this is a wounded part of you that's being heavily projected on your wife, will be the moment in which you can say: actually I want to heal myself from this and I want to heal the relationship with my wife. It will be the moment in which you can give her money and it will feel pleasant, good and right vs something you did because we all screamed that you are TA. You might even start allowing yourself some \"luxuries\" that you didn't even know you wanted.\n\nI don't think there's something wrong with you, so don't take this the wrong way but therapy can be a great way to untangle why we strongly react to some things other people do. You don't have to decide whether it's for you today, just take a few days to sit with the idea. I really wish you all the best, your wife seems like a great person, ambitious, smart and maybe a bit looser with her money, something you could chuckle about together, and I am sure she thinks the same about you, so you can figure this out.", "I notice you didn't answer the question about liking your wife. It's clear you have nothing but contempt for her, given how you speak about her. You have 0 respect for your wife, view her with contempt and possibly also resentment. I hope she wises up to the inequity and how badly you've taken advantage of her and leaves. She deserves better.", "You have more disposable income than her because she\u2019s paying a higher percentage of her income to your shared expenses. Why she ever agreed to that to begin with blows my mind.", "Ok - if you divide equitably - does she have enough to pay for her items? \n\nAlso - if you look at other things around the house or if you have kids - who does more work? Is that split equally or equitably?", "But what you agreed upon is ridiculous if you earn 4x more", "This isn't about her own personal expenses, it's about the shared ones. Earning 4x what your WIFE makes and expecting her to pay 50/50 is just a bit of a dick move honestly. \n\nRepaying her debts would be much easier/quicker if she wasn't putting such a big portion of income to household bills. YTA dude and it seems like you know it, but don't wanna admit it.", "Are you serious? You make 4x her income and still expect her to pay half the living expenses? That's actually bananas. I thought you made maybe 1.5-2x.", "Jesus Christ man you make 4 times than her??? I can't deal with this sub these days", "I agree with you that she's spending outside her means on some things. The car payment is a clear cut example, and your wife is in the wrong for that. But I disagree about school costs falling under the same umbrella. \n\nEssentially, how are you differentiating between \"luxury\" and \"necessity\" when it comes to spending habits? Is a majority of her disposable income going towards her car and her debt, or does she have other major personal expenditures as well? If so, what are they? \n\nAnother question for you: if your wife hypothetically was able to pay off her car/debt in their entirety tomorrow, would you feel comfortable with a continuation of a 50/50 split on household expenditures, despite the fact that you make more money than she does \u2013 meaning a bigger percentage of her paycheck will go towards your joint expenses, and additionally allowing you to save more? How much of this is motivated by a desire to discipline her over finances? \n\nYou also say in another comment that \"I do make much more than she does, in practice, she does not need to work. She works because she wants her own money to spend.\" If your wife wanted to quit her job to become a SAHM of her own volition and not necessity, would you then apply your disposable income not only to 100% of the household expenses, but also towards her debt/car payments? (To be clear, I would not support your wife choosing to do this without serious financial discussions on her part and a commitment to a budget). \n\n> The only way to stop her from \"suffering\" is to eliminate all her debt and cover everything moving forward and letting her use her money however she sees fit.\n\nIn no universe are these the only two options.", "Everyone keeps asking if you like your wife and you haven\u2019t answered once. I can\u2019t tell what you like about her, honestly, because you haven\u2019t said anything kind about her. Acting like this is a teaching moment for her - but who do you think you are to be so belittling and not act as a supportive partner? You have the sweet end of the deal, and it feels like you\u2019re holding it over her head. Again - do you even like your wife???", "Her spending habits are actually irrelevant to the fairness of how you are dividing your SHARED LIVING EXPENSES. That should be equitable and based proportionally on income. Full stop. The other stuff is something you should address in couples counseling and with a financial adviser and possibly individual therapy for her if she's truly a compulsive spender. You need individual therapy to get to the bottom of why you value being \"right\" (even when you are WRONG!) over a meaningful partnership with your spouse, and why you think it is ok to say that being financially fair to your spouse is off the table because of math being hard.", "Then make your help contingent on her having and keeping a budget.", "No kids. I am OCD so I do the cleaning. She is also not the best cook, so I do the majority of the cooking. \n\nCould say it is split by preference. I do not mind that end of the deal. \n\nNow if you are asking she has enough to spend as much as she does comfortably without charging things? No, I would have to eliminate all her debt to make that possible tbh. \n\nNow does she have enough to live comfortably yeah, but that is subjective. My wife likes her lavish spending. Me I am pretty simple.", "You cannot force someone to follow a budget. It has to be a personal choice.", "What do you consider \"lavish spending\"?", "Ok so overall there are some reasonable steps to take:\n\nSplit equitably for house hold expenses\nShe must have a target savings amount (assume you are in US?!? And she can do a max 401k with employer match? - can she maximize that?) because you are undoubtedly being helped by married filing jointly given your income!\nHelp her pay her college debt\n\nThis should get her to use her income to maximize for you both and her to get help she needs\u2026together you can do this way better than each doing it singly!\n\nBut agree she can handle her $750 car payment and that\u2019s ok - think about the tax savings on $20k pretax 401k savings", "Yet you said that by not helping her, you would force her to spend her money better. Which is it?", "OP, if one loves another person enough to be married to that person, one wants that person to be comfortable and happy, when one is **a good partner to that person one loves**.\n\nOne does not expect that partner to pay more proportionally for a lifestyle enjoyed by someone with more privilege, assets, and income. One does not begrudge that partner the costs of education, which don't escalate in civilized societies in the first place. One may want that person driving a very good quality vehicle for basic safety and reliability reassurances, when one in fact is **a good partner to that person one loves**.\n\nYour rejection of basic financial fairness reflects actual hostility toward your wife. Not sure it'd factor in whether she drives a sturdy sedan or SUV vs a shiny new red Lambo, at this point. You have a ready opportunity to decent-up, correct the fiscal disparity which has already occurred, correct the proportions on the bills, and apologize with heartfelt remorse over a really elegant dinner you make or pay for, to beg her forgiveness.", "I think this might be a critical question", "Sorry, when did I say that?  I said if she was a SAHW she would not be able to spend as she does now. Not that she would be better at managing money. She is working cause she wants her own money to spend and have her own financial freedom."]}
