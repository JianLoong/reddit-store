A few days ago he came home from the dorm for the weekend to cool off a little bit.\n\nOn Sunday my wife came into my son\u2019s room and I could tell he was a little agitated trying to work on something he didn\u2019t fully understand. My wife tried to console and reason with him but he ended up raising his voice at her telling her to leave him alone.\n\nThen my wife just told him to pack his bags and that he\u2019s going back to the dorm, he can\u2019t be here if he\u2019s going to act like this. My son tried to talk over her to shut her up but my wife wasn\u2019t having any of it, telling him that she wouldn\u2019t relent until he either calms down or packs his stuff, and that she will not be held emotionally hostage by my son. Then he started to call her an \u201coverbearing b****\u201d and all sorts of other nasty names, to which I had to bark at my son and tell him to stop right now and that be does not call my wife names or there will be problems if he doesn\u2019t deescalate, she\u2019s just doing what she thinks in his best interest, and he finally relented.\n\nLater that evening my son made a comment about how he chatted with his friends who told them that my wife was in the wrong, but I had to say that they don\u2019t feed us, they don\u2019t pay our bills, they don\u2019t know us, that he needs to stop consulting his echo chambers and learn to forgive his mother and forget this, as he needs to respect her for getting him where he is today and because she\u2019s his mother. He tried to tell me that respect is a two-way street, but I said by that logic should his mom call him the nasty names that he does to her? Should we call up his grandma and tell her to cut his college funding? And if he finds someone to be annoying and getting on his nerves, what should he do? Ignore it, to which he responded with \u201cBS, control your damn wife\u201d and I had to disengage.\n\nSince my son went back a couple nights ago, he\u2019s refused to answer our calls and only responds to our texts asking us to apologise, \u201cno ifs ands or buts,\u201d and has told his grandma about us threatening to tell her to pull his funding, which she proceeded to give us an earful over and that she\u2019d pay for it no matter what, and called it \u201creally sad\u201d if we, his own parents, would be \u201cless proud of him than she is\u201d by even asking to do such a thing. I can\u2019t believe he went and told her about this, but now after what she said, I don\u2019t know how to feel about this.", "created_utc": 1677089951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1196xjg/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_he_needs_to_respect/", "score": 2298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he is trying to concentrate and is already frustrated and stressed, he doesn\u2019t need to be interrupted for a pep talk. There\u2019s a proper place and time for everything and that talk could\u2019ve been given at another time. \n\nThen he is indicating he wants to be left alone and he is visibly frustrated and instead of respecting that wish, your wife pushes and then when he reacts, she kicks him out. \n\nYour wife pushed him while he was already stressed, what did she think would happen.

And she was more the asshole for not respecting his boundaries and studies. \n\nIf this is stepmom, you and your wife are assholes and I guarantee she has pulled this type of shit before and flexed that it\u2019s her house and not his and you just go with it. If it\u2019s his actual mom, there\u2019s a level of dysfunction where things escalate really fast and you all need to figure out how to contain it otherwise it\u2019s going to manifest in different ways into his adulthood and your older adulthood.", "YTA - Based off your post and the few response you've made, there's a good chunk of Missing Missing here. And the amount of blanks paints a picture of YTA by void. First, your wife is possibly a step-mother. Which can mean a whole host of pre-existing issues exist that you've excluded. You also gloss over the details of said emotional conversation aside from your son getting upset.\n\nWhen I hear a parent figure throw out \"emotional hostage\" in a fight, that's a big old red flag. There are legitimate times to say that, but so often that's a favorite phrase by manipulaters. The fact your son raising his voice when asking to be left alone in his room was met with expulsion from the house really damages your argument. The fact you only deescalated after things reached critical threshold for your wife's sake, and not both parties, tells me you are carrying a strong bias.\n\nYou also mentioned family counseling in a comment and that your son failed to follow through. I find it highly suspicious that a therapist only issued guidelines for behavior changes to just the child and not adults as well. The fact that historical relations had spiraled badly enough that family therapy was necessary, but you don't explain why is, again, suspect.\n\nAlso when you cut off his computer access while growing up was crazy. You don't mention denying him computer games, social media, or some other entertainment. No, you mention you purposely cut him off from education materials (Khan academy). Casually denying your child education they enjoy because you want a vector for punishment is crazy.\n\nThe fact grandma was easily swayed against you speaks volumes as well. A single fight might have garnered that kind of reaction from a family member. But I suspect this is years of grandma being witness to conflict between the three of you. You being upset that he denied your trump card of financial control also shows you're more upset about the loss of control/power than you are about his wellbeing. You again threaten his education for the sake of control.", "There is some context missing for me to judge. Is this his step mother or his biological mother? I'm getting step mom vibes with you referring to her as \"my wife\" and not his mother. Also why did she go into his room while he was studying? Did she knock?

And is she stepmom or bio mom?", "So, your son came home to work on something that was upsetting him\u2014literally coming home to cool down and work on it in a quiet pace, and your wife thought it would be a good idea to intrude on his space and distract him from the thing he was frustratedly working so hard on? And when he told her to leave him alone, she responded by kicking him out?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see someone frustrated on a project and know to leave them alone. How on earth could she help him besides distracting him and making everything worse? \n\nHe didn\u2019t *want* \u201cconsoling\u201d and to be \u201creasoned with\u201d. He wanted to be left alone so he could THINK and work on the thing that he\u2019d been struggling with. \n\nYTA \n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t respect boundaries. And her \u201chelp\u201d wasn\u2019t appreciated. Her help WAS overbearing. And it looks like she finally pushed him to his limit. \n\nShould he have called her nasty names? Maybe not. But something tells me this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this, and you\u2019ve enabled it.", "ESH\n\nFirstly, your son shouldn't be speaking to anyone like that. Just rude and immature.  And disrespectful of anyone. \n\nSecondly, your wife grossly over-reacted.  He's a kid, still, at 20, was obviously distressed already, and she should have just backed off when he told her to. Respect goes two ways.\n\nThirdly ... You were the one who dragged in Gramma's financing of the school, so she had every right to be there.\n\nAnd most importantly, a typical \"blow up\" in a family is quite normal. You guys have turned this into a whole pissing contest for POWER in the relationship.  You got sucked in.  That's on you.  You are the parent and you've been sucked into a power struggle.\n\nJust walk away.  Seriously.  Leave him alone entirely, for now. All of you need to apologize to everybody else.  Especially Gramma.", "YTA.  \n\n> On Sunday my wife came into my son\u2019s room and I could tell he was a little agitated trying to work on something he didn\u2019t fully understand. My wife tried to console and reason with him but he ended up raising his voice at her telling her to leave him alone.\n\nYour wife created this whole problem.  It sounds like this is not a one time incident, but something your son has been dealing with his entire life.\n\nYou have two choices.  Either apologize, work with your wife to resolve the issue.  Or accept that you will be LC/NC with your son for the first of his life.", "YTA (w/ your wife.)  \n\n\n\"Came into his room\" stands out, to me.  Didn't ask, didn't knock, just... let herself in and basically forced your son to listen and engage even though he clearly wanted to do something else.  \nSo the question I have, why does he have to respect her when she clearly isn't under any obligation to respect him?  \n\n\nThe right to privacy is important.  Someone who wants to be left alone should be left alone.  Your wife doesn't get to decide what's best, and it's rude-as-fuck to force your son to listen to her when he clearly doesn't want to.  Him getting mad at that is reasonable.  I'm not going to say he should have resorted to name calling, but the first act of disrespect wasn't from him, the first bit of shitty behavior didn't come from your son, it came from your wife.  \n\n\nThen you went on to threaten him with someone else's money?  Pretend he has no point when he says respect is a two way street?  He's supposed to act like his mother did him a favor by doing her damn job after having a kid?  He didn't choose to be born, she chose to have him, the fact that she owned up to that responsibility isn't some shit he owes her for, she didn't do him any favors, that was her job after deciding to have a child.   \n\n\nAnd trying to use someone else's money as leverage, like \"oh yeah, how would you like it if we jeopardize your whole future, hm, you going to listen now or should we threaten your future some more\", like... you think that's the moral high ground?  You proud of that?  Do you think that makes you look like the good guy, dangling leverage you don't even have in a literal attempt to bully and threaten your adult son into the behavior you want?   \n\n\nYou both owe your son an apology.  He might owe you one too, yeah, but you owe yours first and more, your wife started this, and you both just kept making it worse when you could have avoided the whole thing by leaving him the fuck alone like he wanted, a totally reasonable request because we've all wanted to be left alone.   \n\n\nYou guys are the assholes here, entirely.", "Firstly is your wife his mom???? Or stepmom? Secondly she started this.. he ask to be left alone.. do I agree with what he said to her NO but she needs to understand boundaries because she cross his when he ask multiple times to let him be.. I\u2019m glad grandma got his back because y\u2019all sound controlling and mentally abusive.", "YTA. So, the context is that your wife and you are controlling and out of touch with current education. You deprived your son from using a computer even for homework as a form of punishment. As someone who loves libraries, I\u2019m telling you: In the last ten years, libraries are not sufficient replacements for a computer.\n\nSo, your son is already behind due to your disruption of his education. He\u2019s now struggling with more difficult material. Your wife\u2019s plan is to reason with and console him, AKA she interrupted him when he was in the middle of studying. She\u2019s again shown no ability to comprehend his educational needs. The dispute escalated to yelling.\n\nYour wife, who clearly has control issues, is upset that your son won\u2019t allow her to engage in her performative parenting that doesn\u2019t meet his needs and dislikes his expression of anger. She won\u2019t respect his boundary to be left alone while working.\n\nYour wife then escalates to throwing your son out of your home and insists on accusing your son of emotional hostage taking (this makes no sense. She\u2019s just mad that your son won\u2019t comply with her, again, performative parenting. She\u2019s the one taking emotional hostages: She wanted his compliance by immediately leaving or, realistically, shutting up and groveling.\n\nAt this point your son snaps and starts insulting his mother, which, given everything else, makes sense. He was fighting with his abuser. You have made no attempt to defend your son, but NOW you jump in to defend your wife. You again reveal that your wife and you have a framework of respect as obedience. You want your son to stop insulting your wife because he is her mother.\n\nYour son then attempts to reset the conversation by bringing up respect as a two-way street, as he seems respect as about dignity, not obedience. That\u2019s not satisfactory to your hierarchical approach, so you don\u2019t acknowledge any of the harm done to your son and instead not only try to turn the tables by making it about the insults and then escalating to threatening to call his grandma to make her cut off support for his educational. Seriously, what does your son\u2019s college funding have to do with this fight? Nothing! But your wife and you are controlling, so you can\u2019t tolerate anything other than blind obedience. Good for grandma for making it clear that she won\u2019t help to abuse your son by supporting any of your threats to cut him off. You both have shown that you can\u2019t handle any dissent or acknowledge your son as an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s why your son told your to control your wife when you brought up ignoring annoyances because, guess what, your wife has made it clear that ignoring her is not an option. Your son MUST engage her. She won\u2019t permit an alternative. \n\nBoth your wife and you need to start owning your desire for control and apologize profusely for your son \u2026 and even then, he\u2019s justified in cutting you off permanently", "YTA. Your wife was definitely in the wrong. He was alone in his room in the middle of trying to tackle a difficult subject, and she barges in to distract him. He said to leave him alone, so she tried to kick him out of the house. Y'all sound like a terrible support system", "YTA. More specifically, your wife is TA.

Your wife for bothering your son when he's busy. Why did she invade his space in the first place? She had no business being in his room, especially after being told to leave him be. \n\nYour son for being rude back, and even worse, using that kind of language with his mother. \n\nAnd you for defending her behaviour, which started this in the first place. And then, instead of simply addressing the issue at hand, you escalate the situation by threatening his education and future with something you have no control over in the first place. \n\nI'm not surprised you're all in family therapy, it sounds like you need it. \n\nAlso, is your wife his bio mother? Something strikes me as odd in this whole thing.", "YTA your wife is in the wrong. He was clearly frustrated and it sounds like your wife was just bothering him as he\u2019s trying to do work. Respect his space, he\u2019s working hard", "ESH - (except grandma) you & your wife seem to dangle things like buying food, providing support, paying for college etc is a form of respect.   You are supposed to want to do those things for your kids/grandkids you dummy.  Respect is earned, not paid for.  \n\nYour wife and son need to learn how to communicate as adults.  It's incredibly hard to know how that conversation went based on your description but I am sure there were multiple de-escalation points that both likely missed.  If sounds like your son tried to end the argument and your wife responds with a nuclear threat to toss him out when he came home to cool off.  \n\nOuch - talk about upping the argument.", "ESH, your son is wrong for calling her bad names but your wife's reaction to him raising his voice was overkill. You knew he was having a hard time in school so the best route would've been to leave him be to have a cooling off period  then revisit to talk about what's going on, how yall can help etc. He is 20 years old not 5.", "So, was OP in the room, or not?\n\nOn Sunday my wife came into my son\u2019s room and I could tell he....\n\nstruggled a bit, after this start.    \n\nis wife the son's mom?  (control your gd wife) If not, what's the story, there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSon's NTA.  OP, I feel, glossed over some salient points. Might BTA   Mom/step mom (YTA) sure pulled the \"get out\" trigger awfully fast.    SHE started a fight with a stressed out 20 year old.", "To rephrase the situation: your son is struggling in school. Likely he is feeling a lot of frustration and his self-esteem has plummeted. Possibly he is facing having a to change career directions entirely based on his performance. In order to catch up he decided to come home to study extra hard. He needed peace and quiet and to be left alone to try to grasp hard concepts. For some reason your wife decides to barge into the room, interrupt his concentration. Your wife\u2019s justification was that his difficulties were causing him distress. Your wife does not have the technical expertise to actually assist son, instead she felt that her baby needed his mommy to comfort him, thus infantilizing someone whose self-confidence was already shaky. \n\nYour son lashed out. Rather than viewing this as a symptom of your son\u2019s distress, you and your wife piled on and threatened him with ending support for his education, thereby increasing your son\u2019s distress and likely ensuring that he will fail his studies, since emotional turmoil makes learning impossible. At a time when your son needed help with his confidence and emotional equilibrium you did your best to destroy it. \n\nNow you wonder why he\u2019s gone radio silent? YTA", "YTA\n\nIt seems your wife went uninvited into his room when he was trying to focus on something very challenging, started talking to him (=disturbing him) and refused to stop talking, leave and let him study to the point where he had to raise his voice at her in an attempt to get her to leave?\n\nYour wife is in the wrong. Whenever I've been under a really stressful deadline or trying to deal with materials that are difficult to grasp, the last thing I, or anyone wants is to be disturbed with unrelated chatter. \"Consoling and reasoning\" is not helpful at all and is just a rude disturbance if the person receiving it indicates they don't want to talk and instead need peace to focus.\n\nYour wife needs to learn it's not ok to barge into other people's rooms uninvited to bother them when they're stressed, and in the middle of trying to focus on working. \"She's only doing what she think is best\" also isn't an excuse, she has to learn to respect it when other people say they need to be alone to focus.\n\nSure your son was also in the wrong for the very rude language he used, but nonetheless it's ridiculous that even though you and your wife both know he's struggling with the materials, he actually had to raise his voice to get through to your wife that he does not want her there talking and \"consoling\" him. He came to your house to get away from the disturbances of the dorm, to have peace. Why didn't she want to let him have it?\n\nYou're also out of line for you to threaten to sabotage his studies just because he didn't humor your wife when she felt like disturbing his studying. Honestly. Your mom is right to be disappointed in you - and you've got a lot of nerve to be upset at him telling her what you did. How about you don't treat your son in a way that will embarrass you if your mom finds out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>that she will not be held emotionally hostage by my son\n\nWhat does that even mean?

As OP refuses to respond to questions and is only engaging in responses that agree with him it seems pretty clear there are parts of this story left out. Additionally one comment does mention there was family therapy, which is a great thing, but again OP only comments that his son has not held up his end of the bargain, again neglecting to comment on what work he and his wife put in and what the underlying issues were. Son resorted to name calling which isn\u2019t necessary which makes him an AH. Mom/stepmom(?) appear to have invaded his privacy and not responded to his need for solitude and went nuclear with the get out of the house if you don\u2019t like my version of support nonsense.

Of course he got upset, raised his voice, and told her to leave.  She overreacted to his outburst and then you came in and did the same.  To be honest, when I'm in the middle of something and I need to concentrate, someone coming near me and talking and asking questions is overwhelming, distracting, and frustrating.  It sounds like all of you still have issues even after therapy.   I get that when your kids raises his voice it can make you react, but you need to take a step back and think about all sides of the issue.  Do you think your wife may have been overbearing to your son at that moment?  Can you understand his frustration?

But why was your wife in his room? Why did he feel like he had to explode? Its obvious he's struggling in school and you know he came home to relax. Is it possible he wanted space and  your wife did not respect that.\n\nAre you the \"no closed doors unless you pay rent\" type of parents who refuse to respect personal space? Does your son have a history of needing to yell and curse to get  you to listen to him and/or respect his boundaries?\n\nAnd what is with your wife's comment about being held emotionally hostage?? Is she saying that she feels like a hostage because he wont engage?

Your wife should respect that.", "ESH but IMO you suck the least. \n\nYour wife barged in on him while he\u2019s stressed and studying and then got mad when he wasn\u2019t receptive to it.

A few days ago he came home from the dorm for the weekend to cool off a little bit.\n\nOn Sunday my wife came into my son\u2019s room and I could tell he was a little agitated trying to work on something he didn\u2019t fully understand. My wife tried to console and reason with him but he ended up raising his voice at her telling her to leave him alone.\n\nThen my wife just told him to pack his bags and that he\u2019s going back to the dorm, he can\u2019t be here if he\u2019s going to act like this. My son tried to talk over her to shut her up but my wife wasn\u2019t having any of it, telling him that she wouldn\u2019t relent until he either calms down or packs his stuff, and that she will not be held emotionally hostage by my son. Then he started to call her an \u201coverbearing b****\u201d and all sorts of other nasty names, to which I had to bark at my son and tell him to stop right now and that be does not call my wife names or there will be problems if he doesn\u2019t deescalate, she\u2019s just doing what she thinks in his best interest, and he finally relented.\n\nLater that evening my son made a comment about how he chatted with his friends who told them that my wife was in the wrong, but I had to say that they don\u2019t feed us, they don\u2019t pay our bills, they don\u2019t know us, that he needs to stop consulting his echo chambers and learn to forgive his mother and forget this, as he needs to respect her for getting him where he is today and because she\u2019s his mother. He tried to tell me that respect is a two-way street, but I said by that logic should his mom call him the nasty names that he does to her? Should we call up his grandma and tell her to cut his college funding? And if he finds someone to be annoying and getting on his nerves, what should he do? Ignore it, to which he responded with \u201cBS, control your damn wife\u201d and I had to disengage.\n\nSince my son went back a couple nights ago, he\u2019s refused to answer our calls and only responds to our texts asking us to apologise, \u201cno ifs ands or buts,\u201d and has told his grandma about us threatening to tell her to pull his funding, which she proceeded to give us an earful over and that she\u2019d pay for it no matter what, and called it \u201creally sad\u201d if we, his own parents, would be \u201cless proud of him than she is\u201d by even asking to do such a thing. I can\u2019t believe he went and told her about this, but now after what she said, I don\u2019t know how to feel about this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your son escalated for sure, but respect is a 2-way street. Neither parent here has behaved in a way worthy of respect", "INFO: is this a pattern of behavior between your son and your wife? She seemed to jump to \"you're getting kicked out\" awfully fast, and he seemed to get into screaming mode awfully fast by your description of events. It's not out of the question that your son may be an entitled A but I feel like some things are missing/glossed over here", "YTA, and your wife too.\n\nYou say that you could clearly tell that he was studying a complicated subject, so why did either of you feel the need to go and interrupt his work at that point? Are you both engineering tutors? Are you qualified to help him better understand the material? \n\nThink of it this way, if a random coworker was struggling with their work would you waltz into their office, interrupt what they\u2019re doing, and insist on talking it through with them while offering any practical assistance? You wouldn\u2019t, right?\n\nSo why would you do it to your own child if you wouldn\u2019t do it to a stranger? Why does the stranger deserve more of your respect than you give your own kid?", "I don't like disrespectful young men, but it sounds like she came into his room and bothered him while he was concentrating on his STUDIES.

Raising your voice and telling your parent to leave you alone is not the correct way to ask them for space.", "YTA\n\nYour son shouldn't have called your wife an \"overbearing bitch\" or told you to \"control your wife\". \n\nYour wife:\n\n* Should have recognized that bothering your son while he's busy and trying to focus on school work is unwelcome;\n* Barring that, when your son told her to leave him alone, **she should have left him alone**. If she felt disrespected by being told to \"leave him alone\", she should have waited until he was free (such as during dinner, perhaps) to bring it up and discuss that she felt disrespected, and he needs to find a better way to communicate. ^[1]\n* Instead, your wife got angry that your son was not responding to her the way she wanted, and resorted to exerting her power as the parent and co-owner of the house to intentionally disrupt him further (telling him to pack his bags and get out)\n\nYour son got angry and emotional with your wife because his mom was constantly needling him, while he was frustrated and stressed and upset. Your response is that he should've just \"ignored it\". You can't ignore someone like that, not they're talking straight in your ear and deliberately trying to get your attention. I also suspect that *had* your son simply ignored your wife, she would have simply raised her voice OR gotten angry and punished your son for ignoring her.\n\nYou can respond to insist that I'm wrong on that last point, but you should instead sit back and consider whether or not there's truth to my words. Your son was in a lose-lose situation, where he either has to let his mother get her way and wait until she's done with him, or stand up for himself and be punished for it. I also suspect your son's explosive reaction is because normal, nice, polite forms of standing up for himself don't work.\n\nYour response is ineffectual and deliberately places responsibility on the victim for the offender's actions, which is to say, you think it's your son's fault for not being able to endure your wife's behavior better. No, sir. Your wife needs to learn to be more considerate of other people, including-- nay, especially-- people she's used to having more power and authority over. \n\nYou know what I do when my parents interrupt me and I'm really busy and pressed for time on an assignment? I explain that I know they're trying to help, but I really need to focus on the assignment. You know what they do? They say they understand and give me space. **That's what it looks like when parent and child have mutual respect for each other.** Sometimes they'll ask if there's anything they can do to help, and I'll say no, but that I appreciate the offer. They then say no problem, and leave, so that I can get back to work. \n\nYour wife doesn't respect your son. Your son feels that disrespect every time she imposes herself on him and ignores his clear communication that she needs to back off. Your wife's lack of respect for her son has caused him to lose respect for her. No amount of therapy will fix that, because the solution will only happen if your son feels like his parents respect him, and it's clear you guys-- both of you-- don't. \n\nSo yeah, OP, nobody here behaved great. But your son's behavior is a reaction to your wife's behavior, which she does because she doesn't respect your son or believe he has the right to demand space from her. That's why I've labeled both you and your wife as YTA, because while your son should *never* have said what he did, his level of assholery is so far below the both of yours, and that's saying something. Please do some self-reflection.\n\n^[1] However, to add to the assholery, judging by your comments, it's clear that there is nothing your son could have said politely to get her to back off.

No one should be called names, not cool. However, what you have failed to realize is that his response was an emotional outburst caused by a situation *your wife created*. Your son came home because he needed a \"safe\" space to try and deal with whatever problem he was encountering at school, and instead of respecting that space, your wife enterjected herself. Your son asked her to leave him alone, which was a *very reasonable request*, and thus establishing a clear boundary, and your wife's response to him setting that boundary was basically \"get out\". So now, not only has she shown a blatant disregard for him but is effectively telling him to leave whatever safety his home might be giving him that would help with the problem. It sounds like he's already dealing with a ton of stress to begin with, so with your wife deciding to pile on a ton more, I'm frankly not surprised he had an emotional outburst. \n\nThe name calling was inappropriate, but the emotions behind it are still valid, and the direct result of your wife's total disregard for your son's space. He has a right to be left alone, and he has a right to ask to be left alone if he's being interrupted. One might argue that since it's your house, she can ask him to leave if she wants to, but what you're seeing are the consequences of that particular action.

Is like she is worth nothing to him. There are healthy ways of dealing with frustration and none of those include insulting. Your son is not ready to live an adult life. I also see this based on some of your comments about the family therapy and your son attitude towards it. I also think there is some deal of manipulation from him, based on the fact that he went to his grandmother to twist the story about pulling the fund. I think your point was clear and he twisted it for his own benefit.\n\nYour wife should respect your son's boundaries. Period. I don't understand how she got into the room in the first place, did she knock? Did he tell her she could come in? If the answer of any of this is \"no\", your wife needs to reconsider her relationship with her son because she is not respecting his privacy. Does this happen often? Does your son always react violently? You haven't answered yet, but is your wife your son's mother? If she isn't, I wouldn't be surprised if that's part of the problem. There are more questions, why was your wife trying to help your son with whatever he was doing? Does she know about the topic or this was a motherly thing? If it was the second, then terrible timing.\n\nYour wife has to understand that actions have consequences, if you break someone's boundaries repeatedly (as I suspect is the case here) there are going to be consequences, your son will be mad. Some days you are going to have him in a good mood so he would just tell her nicely to fuck off, but other days (like this one) he's not gonna be in a good mood, for whatever reason, and he will react harshly. That's still on your wife.

Both of them are acting bad and evidently the communication between them is broken. If you hope to keep having some sort of family idea, you are the nexus between both parties and maybe the only Pacific way to ensure peace between them is go have you talk to both people and tell them to be respectful of the other one. I will also tell you that it sucks, you shouldn't be the messenger, these two are adult people who should be able to communicate maturely and effectively, but I think this is the best solution (along with therapy) to avoid this escalating in ways I wouldn't want to imagine.\n\nThere's something else, I think your son has an ego issue. He seems to think he knows everything and everyone is below him, like you and your wife. When he can't do something, he will take his anger out on other people instead of constructively better himself.
