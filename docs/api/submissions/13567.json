I did the musicals, and academic subjects. I wasn't much of a sportsperson, and not really very social. Toward the end of HS, I made quite a few friends and it got easier. But one of the \"popular kids\" - lets call him Jake - constantly taunted me - for my ethnicity, my body, my \"nerdiness\" and what have you. I have never forgotten it and constantly resented him for it.\n\nFast forward 15 years. Jake has done something very stupid and immature, and as a result, he has been in a coma for several years. I left my country when I graduated Uni, and now live in a major city abroad earning a pretty significant sum. I'm known in my field, and everyone I went to school with is aware of this. Quite frankly, the fat musical kid ended up the most successful graduate of his class.\n\nFor many years, the parents and friends of Jake paid his medical bills to keep him on a ventilator. I never really sympathised to be honest, and kind of thought he had it coming. Anyway, an old friend messages me the other day telling me that the gofundme is finished, and that the parents are almost bankrupt, and \"everyone\" would appreciate it if maybe i could kick 20-30k toward his medical bills. I laughed and said \"absolutely not, I work for my money and the last thing I want to do with it is give it to the person who made my last year at school a misery.\"\n\nNow I am being told I'm a selfish a\\*\\*hole for not helping because \"clearly I can afford it.\" This is despite the person asking knowing that I was mercilessly bullied by Jake. I kinda see it as Karma. I've made it in life and don't want to share the spoils with people who tried to belittle me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: For all of you wonderful people suggesting therapy I appreciate you. But I\u2019m not that kid anymore, I\u2019m a successful professional, married to an amazing woman, with a beautiful daughter. I haven\u2019t thought about \u201cJake\u201d for many years - not since I saw the articles in the newspaper about his calamity. I am certain I needed therapy back then - but I\u2019ve matured and come into my own since that time. I\u2019m happy, healthy and satisfied. I love my life, I love my family, but most importantly, I love myself too. I don\u2019t dwell on the past, but when somebody calls you for 20-30 grand, memories can come back to you very quickly.** ", "created_utc": 1680193471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126rvjo/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_hs_bully_with_his/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, OP, at all.", "I feel like I read a post like this semi recently. It was worded differently but still the same thing basically", "He's not in the US. He's in a country with Universal Healthcare that won't fund private care any longer with no expectation of recovery. His first few years were fully funded by our government. I think the word you're searching for is resentment.", "PM me. Happy to show you evidence. Tbh, only posted because of all the other posts recently. I am an avid AITA reader!\n\nEdit: He is not in the US. As I said in another comment he's in a country with an amazing Universal Healthcare system that funded the first few years of this. Government will not fund a lost cause - hence the private healthcare and fundraising. According to articles, my country funded the first $770,000.00 of this.", "I'm certainly not **happy** that he is in this position. But I do believe in Karma. Some people are built a certain way. I have spent my life trying to do good, to give back. I don't think it's unreasonable to say the universe had other plans for a person filled with nothing other than vitriol and hate.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "My wife told me to cut the cheque because \"success is the best revenge.\" I'd much rather spend it on my Daughter.", "Yes. I'd personally be ashamed to ask. And it's not as if any of them including the parents are poor. I went to a private school and most of these families have money. I wouldn't have a clue what the kids I went to school with earn - but again, I'm uninterested in that.", "Keep strong. Shit gets better. Have faith in yourself - your destiny is yours alone to control.", "Thanks for your reply. We're from a country where 20-30k is money, but not unsurmountable. I believe I was asked because generally I will help where I can. I agree that it is a bit unreasonable to expect someone else to fund a lost cause seven years later. I feel for the guy, but theres no chance of a normal life at this stage. Even if I were not refusing, the money is better spent on a Children's charity or a donation to a hospital. Nothing can help him at this point.", "Yes, the very reason my wife told me to actually write the cheque was because \"success is the best revenge.\"", "I donate plenty. Especially to beyondblue who help kids with depression. It's not about money - i've said over and over - if he were a good decent human being, i'd have written a blank cheque. I just do not see why my hard work, hard work that was belittled by this person, should pay for his recovery. Thank you for the NTA judgement.", "I agree. If I was just sent a link, it would be different. I was essentially asked to take over all his expenses.", "Many have suggested this. I will be doing it in the morning.

Former HS misfit, here, and I am so happy and proud of you for living your best life and achieving so much.  You're being true to yourself, which is firmly in NTA territory.  The real AHs are the people who feel entitled to reach into your life and into your wallet.", "Wait, the guy calling you an AH already had your help paying for some major medical expensive and has the balls to tell you how you should spend your money? He thinks because you helped him, you should help everyone now? Wtf", "NTA. It looks like karma ran over his dogma. You owe him nothing.", "I can forgive you for anything except liking maths.", "> \"you'll never get laid because you're a fat ethnic that likes maths.\"\n\nOh, that poor, bigoted baby!

But doing this would come off very combative and petty, don't waste your time", "Thank you", "NTA, you owe him nothing at all. Maybe the people who wanted you to help thought that you should \"be the better person\" for that?", "Can we take wild guesses? And you can answer by using the hot or cold system... \n\n\nMy first guess ... He tried to befriend a large wild predator. Perhaps a bear. It did not wish to be his friend? Am I close?

But  yeah - keep your money.", "> I don't think it's unreasonable to say the universe had other plans for a person filled with nothing other than vitriol and hate.\n\nSomehow, I doubt he was a cartoon vilian who also kicked puppies and dumped toxic waste into rivers as a business model, and honestly, part of growing past the legacy of being bullied is to recognize this.\n\nYou seem pretty happy about it, though.

And thank you for your kind words. 17 year old me would never believe that things could get better.", ">Will he ever recover?\n\nI think that's a very good question. If Jake has been on life support and in a coma all these years, what kind of quality of life does he have? Does he have any brain function? Sure, some people have awakened from comas years after it happened, but I'm sure that's a tiny, tiny percentage.", "Thank you so much.

But Gleeful that somebody is so ill? No no. I just don't feel I should be forced to contribute to someone that if the shoe was on the other foot - most certainly would not contribute to me.", "This was my second concern because that is absolutely what would happen. I seriously considered giving a little bit of money to the cause but knew it would never end. I've said in other comments - that money is better spent elsewhere whether on my own family or charitable contributions. It's funny because many of the people pushing for this money have changed not at all, and I know deep down that not a single one of them would come to me but for this.", "Bad bot", "That sounds like the family just needs to let him go. Maintaining him on a ventilator indefinitely is miserable for everybody involved.", "I'm not a doctor, but I did a quick Google search and apparently the chances of waking up from a coma largely depends on the severity and cause of brain injury, age and how long the person has been in a coma for.\n\nJake has been in a coma for years, on a ventilator and I'm guessing showing no signs of waking, so unfortunately there's very, very little to no chance he's coming out of his coma.\n\nJake died the day of his accident.

I'm glad to know that most of the community agree with me on this one. I appreciate all of you.", "I'm happy to hear how things worked out for you!!! I wish you and those around you the best and the antibullying charity is a great idea.", "Stuck his hand into an electrical outlet?", "Also clearly NTA", "Colder. Think even dumber. Nobody will guess because 99.9% of the human race is smart enough to realise you shouldn't do what he did. All for the lolz right?", "Hmmm... Put his head in the toilet and kept it there until he passed out", "He tried to do that to me in 2007. I'd like to think I'm above that kind of shit."]}
