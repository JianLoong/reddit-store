I did the musicals, and academic subjects. I wasn't much of a sportsperson, and not really very social. Toward the end of HS, I made quite a few friends and it got easier. But one of the \"popular kids\" - lets call him Jake - constantly taunted me - for my ethnicity, my body, my \"nerdiness\" and what have you. I have never forgotten it and constantly resented him for it.\n\nFast forward 15 years. Jake has done something very stupid and immature, and as a result, he has been in a coma for several years. I left my country when I graduated Uni, and now live in a major city abroad earning a pretty significant sum. I'm known in my field, and everyone I went to school with is aware of this. Quite frankly, the fat musical kid ended up the most successful graduate of his class.\n\nFor many years, the parents and friends of Jake paid his medical bills to keep him on a ventilator. I never really sympathised to be honest, and kind of thought he had it coming. Anyway, an old friend messages me the other day telling me that the gofundme is finished, and that the parents are almost bankrupt, and \"everyone\" would appreciate it if maybe i could kick 20-30k toward his medical bills. I laughed and said \"absolutely not, I work for my money and the last thing I want to do with it is give it to the person who made my last year at school a misery.\"\n\nNow I am being told I'm a selfish a\\*\\*hole for not helping because \"clearly I can afford it.\" This is despite the person asking knowing that I was mercilessly bullied by Jake. I kinda see it as Karma. I've made it in life and don't want to share the spoils with people who tried to belittle me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: For all of you wonderful people suggesting therapy I appreciate you. But I\u2019m not that kid anymore, I\u2019m a successful professional, married to an amazing woman, with a beautiful daughter. I haven\u2019t thought about \u201cJake\u201d for many years - not since I saw the articles in the newspaper about his calamity. I am certain I needed therapy back then - but I\u2019ve matured and come into my own since that time. I\u2019m happy, healthy and satisfied. I love my life, I love my family, but most importantly, I love myself too. I don\u2019t dwell on the past, but when somebody calls you for 20-30 grand, memories can come back to you very quickly.**  \n\n\nSecond edit: WOW! Thank you to all the amazing people who have helped me feel a little less shitty this evening. I am trying to reply to everyone and I'm sorry I have not published exactly why \"Jake\" is in a coma but I am trying to reply to DMs that ask. This community is amazing, I felt really shitty today and all of you have done so much to make me feel better about it all.

And anyone tlnear him can no longer afford to keep him on a ventilator. Then maybe it's time to let go and let nature take it's course.\n\nThis doesn't sound like it's anything new. And not only is it financially ruining everyone around him. But he is taking up valuable space and resources that could go to people who need it and will recover. Not taking up a hospital bed, equipment, staff, and everyone's financial resources for someone who will not improve. The family is going to have to grieve sometime.

They refused to accept that, before and after her death. \n\nDesperate families will project and imagine and spin moaning, blinking and twitching into an entire personality. Some people just can't accept reality, no matter how many times it's explained to them they're not helping anyone but themselves with their delusions.", "Wow, that was a great story. Thank you for sharing", "Where in Aus is this dude that\u2019s been in a coma for 8 years? And what medical bills is this imaginary dude paying with free healthcare", "Australia doesn't technically have free healthcare. We have medicare which basically just makes the bills a lot less than they'd normally be. I'm not sure if people would need 20-30k for a medical bill though..", "You don't have to donate if you don't want to. There are a million and one potential deserving recipients of donations out there. Are you being selfish not donating to the Mongolian widows and orphans fund?\n\nBut just keep in mind that Jake was a kid when he bullied you. It was mean and nasty but kids do shit like that? Do they deserve to have the plug pulled for things they did when they were kids? I doubt it.", "this is some tubby theatre kids wet dream lmfao. it\u2019s definitely fake", "Yeah I worked in assisted living and one of our residents was in a coma for a little over six months after an accident. He's still physically disabled due to long-term muscle atrophy and will likely need to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life.", "I think we can all hazard a guess as to why he has very few places/nowhere he can turn. NTA bro I respect your tenacity here", "To be fair saying she did a string \u201creally poor irresponsible decisions\u201d to his face makes you sound kinda pompous and callous. Could\u2019ve just told him \u201csorry I can\u2019t\u201d", "Dived into the shallow end of a pool, game of chicken gone wrong, let a buddy shoot an apple balanced on his head...\n\nThe problem is I just can't think of one thing stupider than all others.", "I totally imagined that too!", "My kid was in a coma for 2 weeks because of a seizure. Bill was 800k", "He pushed,  I pushed back. And, FWIW, I think it is a really poor, irresponsible decision to not only not have health insurance when you are a single mother of three (medicaid is strong and well funded in my state), but to go skiing without a helmet *when you have three children depending solely on you and your income* is also an absolutely poor, irresponsible decision.", "Why are you still in contact with these shit stains who played play both sides and are clearly friends with the AH who made you miserable? Your high school friends all sound like ass holes tbh.", "Yet Americans vote Republican", "My bill from when I was in the hospital for 2 weeks a 3 days was over $5ook and that was over 20 years ago in CA. I would not want to see what it would be now.", "I\u2019m saying that saying essentially \u201csorry I don\u2019t give money to stupid idiots\u201d when talking about a single mother that\u2019s in a coma is kind of in poor taste. Don\u2019t donate if you don\u2019t want but like jeez", "Maybe your friend wanted to play hero. \n\n\"Oh, I'm still friends with OP. Let me ask him.\" \n\nAnd you saying no means he can't play hero. \n\nOh well. Too bad.", "I also take satisfaction in your refusal :P", "In Australia, you can get an epipen for a little over $50. If you're an Aussie, under $20. Concession holders about $4 and for some people it's completely free.", "Oh trust me, working in healthcare in Kentucky during covid....I'm out with most of my family. Turns out I'm pro China and a communist. Nah I'm a socialist like Jesus except idgaf a fuck who you screw if they're legal and consenting. Even Rand isn't straight but he is far votes.", "Like I still work in healthcare and deal with insurance and I would \ud83d\udcaf go to only fans to make ends meet if healthcare needs were met. Osteoporosis meds shouldn't be 150k a dose in the US and $300 in others", "The Terry Schiavo case became a political thing, meant to score points with constituents. The US is about the only country that allows the family to override the doctors' assessment of futile care. In the UK and most of Western countries, a team of doctors would assess cases like that over a period of days/weeks. If they deemed it futile care with no hope of recovery, the ventilators and other machines would be turned off and nature allowed to take its course. The family couldn't override the doctors' DNR order. \n\nIn this case of OP here, the medical doctors have likely deemed this futile care - so the family is having to fund this themselves, since the national health care won't pay for it.", "It's true. My kids' epipen costs AU$4 each thanks to part of our medical system (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) and his prescription. Without the prescription, it would cost just under AU$100 each.", "I, at 19, shouldn't have had to sign contracts to study my child in exchange for medical bills to be paid for.", "I'm really sorry to hear that.  I totally understand/support someone being DNR, but generally that's because you don't want shit quality of life after a medical calamity, not because you just want to die. Have you tried therapy? Hope things turn around for you!", "What is the usual clientele for respiratory therapists? I'm assuming the patients have trouble breathing, but what are the causes? Are most of the patients elderly?", "People with COPD, asthma, anyone on a vent or coming off of one, which could be someone with covid or a car crash survivor. Definitely not only old people.", "I know some of the physiotherapists I work with (I\u2019m admin) here in the UK are respiratory therapy trained too. Usually sick elderly, cancer, sometimes cystic fibrosis, anyone that requires help coughing stuff up/maintaining the airway basically. They do a lot more as well, but the ones I\u2019ve spoken to are usually on call every so often for stuff like that.", "Guessing he either lit himself on fire or shot himself. Or tried to breathe underwater.", "Was he eaten by a rare bird?\n\nSeriously though, these fools expect you to fork out 30 grand to keep this brain dead dude\u2019s body alive for a year? Even if he were a saint, it\u2019s time to let go.\n\nAdd in all the other bullshit? Tell them to kick rocks and go back to enjoying the amazing life you\u2019ve built for yourself!", "<3 I truly hope things get better for you, hang in there, I hope your youth will help you!! Wish I had anything better to say, but truly hoping really good things for you.", "and what newspaper is publishing his story lol", "Guessing the doctors determined there was a negligible chance of him waking up from the coma, which obviously wouldn\u2019t be covered by Medicare.", "My nerves are tingling.\n\nSry, but i call bullshit on this.\n\nYTA", "Ngl sounds hella made up", "I could have sworn I read a similar story not even a couple weeks ago. HS bully is dying of cancer and OP refused to donate despite being peer pressured by bully\u2019s friends.", "So op is an asshole because they\u2019re not giving 30k to someone that made their life miserable? Do you even realise how many smart cars you can buy with 30k usd? 4, you can buy 4 smart cars (assuming they\u2019re all around 10k aud), and I\u2019m sure most people would rather have 4 smart fortwos instead of giving 30k to a person that made their life miserable.", "Don't piss on fire.. it stinks...", "Jake's not gonna get the money either. Family will \ud83e\udd14", "I am an ICU RN and I wish mkre people would do this. It's cruel to watch what they are doing to Jake and way too many people never learned how to process grief or let go.

If we give everyone healthcare it will disincentivize being healthy /S", "It's not just rep., it's all politicians.", "America is so backwards in so many ways. All that wealth concentrated at the top that could be distributed among the people but isn\u2019t yet developed countries with less wealth distribute it better (with room to improve admittedly). So much greed and corruption in America, i feel bad for the working people who didn\u2019t ask for it but are forced to deal with it because it\u2019s easier said than done to just up and move to another country where the standard of living for working class people is better", "Your American ones. \n\nThat shit wouldnt fly here down under", "you literally said you\u2019re from australia in what way is that a small country? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Dude. I was bullied all through school, too. I've forgiven most of my bullies. They were only kids at the time. I still resent them, but I can't live with anger and a desire for revenge. It's not worth it. Acts of petty revenge like this hurt you as much as those you seek justice against... particularly when said target is in a coma and will probably never know anyway."]}
