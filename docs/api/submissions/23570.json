She doesn't care for your belongings and won't take responsibility for her actions.\n\n\"i get really emotional over smaller things like this.\"\n\nThis absolutely is not a small thing, don't try to diminish your boyfriend's sister's actions by saying this. Your reaction is valid and extremely understandable.\n\nThis also goes to show that your boyfriend will put his family over you, even when they're in the wrong. Are you prepared to have your boyfriend call you an AH or say that you're overreacting to anything rude/disrespectful his family may do to you or others? Sometimes it's better to leave situations like these before they get worse.\n\nEDIT: Also you appear to have someone being rude for no reason in these replies, just ignore them.

Losing something that doesn't belong to her is bad. Assuming it's fine and you can just buy a new one is asshole behavior. Claiming it's not their fault is truly outrageous behavior. You are 100% within your rights to make a scene. SHE should be buying you a new top, and paying for fast shipping, so you have your top back before you leave.\n\nAlso is your boyfriend really fabulous in other ways?

Unless of course you were swearing, sending offensive messages bringing it up at any given opportunity then yes YWBTA.\n\nYour BF having been with you should know about your condition and how it affects emotions over personal items. If he doesn't try educating him on it. As it was your property could you come to a compromise and ask the sister for half the money so you can buy a new top? If she can't take responsibility when she borrows your clothing then just say \"no sorry\" the next time she asks.\n\nAlso if it happens again- the best way to remove gum is to stick the garment in the freezer and it should peel off.", "NTA. I'm also autistic and know I get upset at small, dumb stuff, so sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting. My stuff is very important too, I also have trauma from being homeless/losing possessions and such. When people disrespect my property it feels like they're disrespecting me, honestly. I realized I actually love to share, I don't mind, but because people don't treat my belongings with the same respect I would (or even the same respect I would treat their belongings) I've stopped letting people borrow things. Only my partner borrows my stuff and he knows to return it how he found it, or is even okay with me saying no. Your boyfriend should've stuck up for you in this situation as well, and at least offered to buy you a new shirt since you were nice enough to let HIS sister borrow it, whom you have zero obligation to. PS: That's two strikes.... she's shown you she's less than capable of caring about your items. No more lending to her!", "NTA but would probably be less stressful just to accept it and move on for now with holiday prep and stuff.
