My sister has been married to Kevin since she was 18 and has four kids with him who are 8, 6, 5 and 3. Her oldest two and her youngest are boys and her 5 year old is a girl. My sister has always complained about her MIL being too in her husband's business, being too possessive of her husband and doesn't respect her as the mother of her grandchildren or her son's wife. She has also mentioned how her husband's two sisters have nothing to do with their mom because she heavily favored her boys and never took the same level of interest in them.\n\nThis is 100% my sister. She is one of those boy moms who talks about girls one day taking her babies away from her, how she'll be dad's mom and never see grandkids, how her boys won't need her as much when they get older and how sad it makes her. She posts all sorts of memes about that and has even made some videos for her Instagram where she talks about boy mom life and has cried on videos saying she'll miss her boys when they move out and get married. My niece is the only child she never mentions in these videos. She has never talked about a future son in law taking her baby girl away from her or anything like that. She even cried to our mom a couple of times about how she's going to have her babies leave her one day and not want to be her little guys anymore. A couple of times when she has brought this stuff up to me I have asked her why she's just sad about her boys growing up or why she'd want them to have the same relationship as now in 20 years. She always ignores me.\n\nI have two kids myself. My son is 2.5 and my daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm excited for them to grow and be amazing people. But I also enjoy the moments we have now and I feel as though my job as their mom and my husband's as their dad is to help them grow into amazing people while also caring for their needs while they are too little to do that for themselves. \n\nA couple of days ago my niece was with me for the day and she asked me if I was sad that I had a girl this time. I told her no, that I love my daughter and would not trade her for the world. I asked her why she'd ask me that and she said she feels like her mommy wishes she was a boy too and how her mom prefers her brothers. She also mentioned her mom not spending time with her and she asked me to speak to her mom for her.\n\nI spoke to my sister yesterday and told her my niece was feeling neglected and maybe she should spend some time with her. She waved that off and then I saw she was posting again about boy moms and saying she will always be #1 woman in their lives. I told her she needs to cut that stuff out because it's creepy and she is shaping up to be the MIL from hell and just like her own MIL she hates so much. She accused me of talking out of my ass and having no idea what it's like.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682160921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v2ghz/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_shaping_up_to/", "score": 1056, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's worse is when your niece sees how you are with your own daughter she'll know she got screwed over by her own mom. If you have the time and energy be that cool, strong but firm big Aunty for her. She's gonna need a good female influence in her life.", "NTA - I feel heartbroken for your niece and the neglect she\u2019s experiencing\u2026 Its so blatantly obvious she even recognizes it herself. I\u2019m also fearful for the boys as it sounds like covert incest may be in their future.", "Talk to her father and see if they can develop a special bond. If dad favors her, it will help with her self esteem.  You will never change your sisters attitude about the boys.", "NTA. And frankly this obsession with kids growing up and becoming independent as losing your baby is flat out gross.\n\nI have one of each and I've told both of them that my job as a mom is to raise them to be independent. Knowing that soon Christmas morning will be a solo affair is deeply painful but if I love my kids and build a healthy relationship with them I won't ever lose them.", "NTA. I have a son, so I get the whole \"boy mom\" persona. But I also want my son to grow into an independent, happy adult with his own life and identity. I want to have a positive relationship with the person he chooses to love, not a competitive one. Your sister needs to process these emotions before her sons begin dating.", "NTA, If a kid tells you that they don't feel like their mom loves them because they are a girl, you immediately lose all asshole status. YOUR NIECE WHO IS 5 FEELS LIKE HER MOTHER DOESNT LOVE HER BECAUSE SHE IS A GIRL. that's the real issue here, and if your sister can't see it, then she shouldn't be having any kids,and definitely not 4", "NTA. \n\nPlease keep spending as much time with your niece as possible. Don\u2019t leave the boys out though because they may need someone in the future just like your niece will. Yes, her mother should be the one to show her love, but since she\u2019s not capable of it, give her someone she knows she can always lean on. I personally wouldn\u2019t say anything else because your sister could decide to cut you out of their lives. That wouldn\u2019t help your niece at all.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a piece of work. Your poor niece. She obviously watched you with your daughter and saw something missing in her own life. At 5 years old. Ugh. What about your BIL, does he treat the kids differently too? Does your niece get lots of attention from him for being the only girl? If she does, I bet it's making your sister jealous af, even if she doesn't recognise it. Mothers being jealous and even intimidated by daughters is pretty common. Your sister is deliberately making your niece feel like crap so niece doesn't ever have the confidence to do things that will outshine mom. It's neglect. It's disgusting.", "NTA - keep telling her", "op=nta\n\nBecause she's emotionally neglecting her daughter.  \n\nUnfortunately, your words went in one ear and out the other without ever processing.  The best you can do is find ways to support your niece, make her feel special(tho i've seen enough reddits to know your Sister will \"attack\" you for neglecting her precious sons).", "NTA. Your poor niece", "nta - I feel so sorry for your niece", "Nta", "NTA. Those poor kids.", "NTA. \n\nTag her in the Facebook group \"The boy moms are being wierd and incesty again\"", "Talk about wishing your time away! The eldest is only 8 for crying out loud! My husband is in his late 40\u2019s and very close to his mum and dad. Of course I actively encourage it and do what I can to him visiting them easy and stuff but it\u2019s also made easy for me because I get on great with them both. His mum loves that after I came into his life he started eating healthier and saw changes in him as positive.\nIf his mother was an absolute chore and just saw me as the woman who took away her baby and hated that he listened to me and things like that then it would be very different. And I can also say without doubt that, while I would never put him in the position of having to, if he was forced to choose between me or his mum he would choose me.\nThis woman is going to become a self fulfilling prophecy because she is going to automatically resent any woman her sons choose and it will be obvious to the woman and when they find one who they decide they want a future with they will start pulling away from her because she will make life so difficult for them. She will lose them because of her own behaviour! Silly thing is that her daughter will have pulled away a long time before because of her current behaviour so she will have poor future relationships with all her children at the rate she is going!\nOP you are NTA at all and I hope your sister listens some day.", "NTA - please send her a link to these responses", "NTA and the fact your niece notices this at such a young age is so sad. I'm glad she has you.", "OP. If you\u2019re able and willing, please be that positive female adult figure in your nieces life. That\u2019s horrid that at such a young age, she is feeling that way or experiencing it. Hopefully through the osmosis of you being a wonderful mom to your daughter, your niece can see and grow up seeing that it\u2019s ok to be female. She\u2019s living in a toxic environment that is going to not only shape her relationship with her mom but with her own self worth and self esteem. I love your philosophy on raising children, as it should be. Congrats on your addition.", "NTA, and remind your sister of this conversation when your niece turns 17 and files for emancipation.", "NTA. Someone has to say it. I hope you can give your niece what your sister won't, though it's not the same. That poor little girl is being emotionally neglected.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. She will be that MIL, and her daughter will be the one that she actually never sees.", "Definitely NTA. And I can speak from the point of view as a son who had that type of mom!\n\nYou are 100% right, as you get older, the attention these types of moms give turns from cute to creepy. My mom would talk about things that no child wants to hear about from their mom, like her s*x life with my dad, and I often felt like a fill-in husband. Things she did that seemed cute and caring and sweet as kids, like wanting to be involved in every part of our lives, became controlling and manipulative as my siblings and I got older.\n\nI can give your sister a picture of her future if she wants. Out of 8 adult kids, 6 boys and 2 girls, 6 of the kids have very limited/no contact with our mom. The girls had severe image/self-worth issues and have told the mom the way she treated them made them feel like they mattered less than their brothers. It affected their relationships and they have had to work hard to see their value. The 4 boys have told her they feel like she is manipulative and trys to influence all their decisions from professional to personal like who they date, so they want limited to no contact with her. They don't want her opinion or interference in their lives.", "NTA (edited to add)\n\n\nIck. It seems like your sister is trying to force her sons into being the emotional partner(s) that her own husband is to his own mother.\n\n\nYou've said that it's unlikely that talking to your BIL will help, as he's not a very involved father.\n\n\nIs your own mother in the picture? Maybe your sister would listen to her own mother, your niece's maternal grandmother.\n\n\nThe situation is very messed up, and I feel so bad for all four children.", "Poor niece. Sounds like emotional neglect. Poor girl is going to have to deal with a host of issues around her self worth and right to exist. Feeling like her mother regrets her is so heartbreaking to read.\n\n Your sister needs therapy. Her parenting is going to make all the kids' lives harder. What if one of the boys she treasures so much is transgender? I would fear for the safety of that child. I fear for the little girl's safety when they're out because the sister may not care if the child returns home with them! \n\nShe's not a \"boys' mom\". If this keeps up, it may be better for her kid  to realize her mother is a bit messed up in her views and for someone else in your family to adopt this kid to protect her from her mother's neglect.", "The poor girl needs therapy now but probably won\u2019t get it in years. Teaching her to be her own person and encouraging her independence is fantastic advice. She needs to know, really know, it\u2019s not her fault.", "I'd mention it to the husband. Maybe he can try to sway her..... it's doubtful but worth a try.", "Honestly OP I would talk to your BIL about what your niece said. Maybe he can help get through to your sister before the damage becomes irreparable for your niece", "Every child deserves a parent, but not every parent deserves a child. It sounds like you're a responsible parent by meeting your children's emotional needs as well as their physical needs. Your sister, on the other hand...", "Just be prepared to take in niece when the time comes, because you know it's going to come.", "Maybe you can start by scheduling something for you, your sister & your niece (and your daughter when appropriate), maybe increasing girls time so that it might prompt them to be able to do it without you on occasion.", "It would of course be best if her own mother loved her, but in the absence of that, I'm sure she would really value having a loving female role model who takes interest in her as she grows up. That poor girl needs someone, my heart breaks for her. She's so young and already knows her mom doesn't love her.", "NTA! Poor child!", "Have you talked to your brother in law about this? Sounds like he's complacent in her neglect.", "Are you two close to your mom. If so, I would definitely try and enlist her help to get your sister to see sense.", "Honestly I don't think it's really a coincidence that your sister and her MIL are alike... Seems like BIL subconsciously sought a romantic partner with similar personality traits and temperament as his mother. Considering how enmeshed and obsessed MIL is with him I'm not surprised... I hate it when Freud is proven correct.\n\nAll of Freud's dissidents are probably rolling in their graves \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnyway NTA and I'm so sorry your niece has noticed this lack of care and love I hope you're able to fill some of that void for her", "If she's so worried about her sons marrying one day, she could consider such an occasion as gaining another daughter. It'd help if, in the meantime, she'd practice being a mom and friend to her own daughter.", "Op if you do this lmk. As a therapist I work with parents who don\u2019t see how much they\u2019re hurting their kids and anytime I\u2019ve tried to point things out they blow out of therapy. Sometimes I do wonder if a staged intervention with family would be better \ud83e\udd14", "The niece is 5 and probably doesn't see her mother's Facebook posts. I think OP mentioned the posts as examples of how vocal the sister is about her preference for her sons. I imagine it's her home life where the girl is feeling neglected, not on Facebook.", "I actually like your idea but with a few changes. Use instagram and tag the sister in each post. Let her followers know she\u2019s not just a boy mom.", "It's in the first paragraph of the post", "Say it again, and again, and again... And then again and again!  AHs deserve to be called out as long as they are behaving like AHs.", "Agreed! It sounds she doesn\u2019t even see anything wrong with her behavior. That makes it difficult to get through to her. I hope BIL might be able to help.\n\nAlso NTA OP. I\u2019m legitimately concerned about the damage your sister is doing to all of her children but especially her daughter.", "It does not sound like OP has really tried tried, just brought the topic up as complaints in asides. If sis can brush her off so easily, that's a problem.  OP can't force the sister to change her mind, of course, but there are still a few things OP could try.\n\nFor example, OP could call or visit for the express purpose of the conversation, to emphasize its importance to her.  OP could say what the daughter said rather than pussyfooting around with vague language about his \"feeling neglected.\"  OP could research ways to convince others; comparing them to people they hate is generally not effective.  OP can point out that social media is forever, and the daughter could easily see - now or in the future - the concrete evidence that backs up her gut reaction to how she's being disfavored.  OP could emphasize how hurt the daughter is rather than how toxic the parenting is.  Or OP could trying talking with the husband, taking care not to criticize *his* mother.\n\nIt sounds instead like OP has tried hardly anything and is all out of ideas, so went straight to insults that will make the whole bus stand up and clap... but won't do anything for anyone actually involved.", "I think this is probably the way to go. The sister sounds like someone who is going to be swayed by someone she perceives as having authority on the subject\u2014 and that is not her sister, which is why she so easily brushes her off. I wouldn\u2019t stop saying it personally, because I would care too much about my niece. But I would talk to my mom or aunts or grandma etc.", "She clearly doesn\u2019t want more daughters.", "She doesn't want daughters LOL, so that wouldn't be a point of benefit.", "That's exactly the situation my mom is living through. No hobby, no passion other than taking care of her children (we're 27 and 25 at this point). We left the city around 20 for a reason around.", "They also sometimes don't do anything if there is physical abuse", "what a bizarre comment", "she'd probably be delighted if her sons all married dudes. She would double her boy mommage", "\n\nRight????", "It's not. OP hasn't really tried.", "OP should say this and see her reaction"]}
