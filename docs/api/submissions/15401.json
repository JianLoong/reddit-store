My sister has been married to Kevin since she was 18 and has four kids with him who are 8, 6, 5 and 3. Her oldest two and her youngest are boys and her 5 year old is a girl. My sister has always complained about her MIL being too in her husband's business, being too possessive of her husband and doesn't respect her as the mother of her grandchildren or her son's wife. She has also mentioned how her husband's two sisters have nothing to do with their mom because she heavily favored her boys and never took the same level of interest in them.\n\nThis is 100% my sister. She is one of those boy moms who talks about girls one day taking her babies away from her, how she'll be dad's mom and never see grandkids, how her boys won't need her as much when they get older and how sad it makes her. She posts all sorts of memes about that and has even made some videos for her Instagram where she talks about boy mom life and has cried on videos saying she'll miss her boys when they move out and get married. My niece is the only child she never mentions in these videos. She has never talked about a future son in law taking her baby girl away from her or anything like that. She even cried to our mom a couple of times about how she's going to have her babies leave her one day and not want to be her little guys anymore. A couple of times when she has brought this stuff up to me I have asked her why she's just sad about her boys growing up or why she'd want them to have the same relationship as now in 20 years. She always ignores me.\n\nI have two kids myself. My son is 2.5 and my daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm excited for them to grow and be amazing people. But I also enjoy the moments we have now and I feel as though my job as their mom and my husband's as their dad is to help them grow into amazing people while also caring for their needs while they are too little to do that for themselves. \n\nA couple of days ago my niece was with me for the day and she asked me if I was sad that I had a girl this time. I told her no, that I love my daughter and would not trade her for the world. I asked her why she'd ask me that and she said she feels like her mommy wishes she was a boy too and how her mom prefers her brothers. She also mentioned her mom not spending time with her and she asked me to speak to her mom for her.\n\nI spoke to my sister yesterday and told her my niece was feeling neglected and maybe she should spend some time with her. She waved that off and then I saw she was posting again about boy moms and saying she will always be #1 woman in their lives. I told her she needs to cut that stuff out because it's creepy and she is shaping up to be the MIL from hell and just like her own MIL she hates so much. She accused me of talking out of my ass and having no idea what it's like.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682160921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v2ghz/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_shaping_up_to/", "score": 2044, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m fortunate that when we started dating he started to realize how unsustainable his mom was and has at least done a decent job of prioritizing our family. It\u2019s not always perfect, and MIL rears the emotional incest monster as much as she can, but we try to keep it in check.", "How about his sister? Could you get an army of aunties together to help your niece?", "OP that's because your sister doesn't want a daughter and she'll most likely not claim her daughter until she wants to play mother of the bride or grandma to her sons.\n\nIf she could trade her daughter for another son she would. No, she won't admit it but her actions have confirmed it.\n\nI also believe that your sister and her mother-in-law, DECIDED to become a \"boy mom\"...was in order to be \"picked over other women\", by a male. \n\nConfirmation #1, your sister is already obsessing over claiming the top position in her sons' lives. \n\nConfirmation #2, she sees any other woman in her sons lives as a threat. \"She feels threatened by a future wife\n\nConfirmation #3, she views loving her own daughter as stealing her attention away from her sons. She's obsessed with racking up points from her sons, that's another reason why she ignores your niece. In her twisted mind, she's telling herself that she has to show her loyalty to her sons like this in order to win.", "Your sister might come around on her daughter when she\u2019s a teenager, but I\u2019m going to tell you the truth: it\u2019s too late. Your niece has already realized. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t want a girl. Not at all. But me, her second child that she planned, was a girl. I spent 16 years of my life hearing about how my mom never, ever wanted a girl. Ever. She only wanted boys. She gets along better with boys. She never wanted children, but then when she started having them, she only wanted BOYS. \n\nAnd at 16, she walked into my room one day while I was laying in bed late at night, trying to sleep, crying, and said, \u201cI realize that God gave you to me to make me understand that I *do* like having a daughter. That\u2019s why He sent you to me. To make me realize I do.\u201d\n\nSweet, right? But it was too late. I\u2019d known since I was 6 that I, however planned, was not wanted. I wasn\u2019t wanted as much as my brother who she had on accident at 18. I just wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t begrudge my brother that, but when he died, my mom made sure to tell me he was her favorite. She said it was a joke later, but our relationship was already damaged. I knew she didn\u2019t want me after telling me, sometimes indirectly, sometimes very direct and harshly, that I wasn\u2019t what she wanted. \n\nYour niece knows that. A lot of kids don\u2019t come back from that. Many parents act worse to their unwanted child in their moments of intense grief. \n\nThere will be a great chance that this will be your niece\u2019s life. You\u2019ve done a great thing \u2014 standing up to her and bringing it to your sister\u2019s attention. Nobody ever did that for me, in all the times I cried, asking why my mother just didn\u2019t like me. But your sister is not going to change for a long time, likely. And you HAVE to be there to remind that child that she\u2019s wanted. Validate her every time she tells you this. This poor baby deserves that. Trust me. She will look at you all different if you don\u2019t validate her. I only ever got to be a lesson, but you have an opportunity to treat your niece as something better.", "I would have done the same... it is the most obvious tactic to try to bring some empathy out of her, sadly it did not work.\nDo you think this has to do with this social media trend? Did she have problems with internalized misoginy before becoming a \"boys mom\"? Is it because her husband is so close to her mother, as if she felt lonely and were using her sons to fill that gap? Does she have a life, hobbies or a personality outside of being a \"boys mom\"? (Sorry if that sounds harsh, but tbh...)\nI think is going to be very detrimental for everyone if she keeps going down this road, not only for your niece. I am so so sorry for her, it is heartbreaking, because this is probably destroying her self esteem and is going to create a ton of problems for her. I am not a therapist, but talking from sort of a similar experience, and it messed me up in all sorts of ways. The sooner she gets professional help, the better, ideally tomorrow. Best if your sister goes too, or family therapy, idk.", "I'd love to be wrong about this but I don't think this is purely an issue that can be logically reasoned into a good solution. I think sister would need to voluntarily put herself through doing the work of gaining several decades worth of emotional maturity\n\nIt sounds like sister is treating ALL of her children in a way that's entirely inappropriate. Enmeshing herself with the boys and preemptively preparing to treat any hint of them developing age appropriate independence as a tragedy she's the victim of. And rejecting/neglecting the girl for the supposed flaw of being \"too independent\" to fill the role of a helpless doll that makes her mommy feel important. \n\nMy father wasn't quite a carbon copy of this but he definitely shared the trait of treating me as a source to get his emotional needs met instead of focusing on meeting/supporting mine. I can say from experience that talking about the problem didn't work and only caused more hurt. \n\nIf anyone's interested in learning more about this dynamic I can't give a strong enough recommendation to \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\" by Lindsay Gibson", "Sister sounds actively uninterested", "Spot on!  I learned in school that having a figure to look up to that isn\u2019t a parent has great outcomes for kiddos.  It doesn\u2019t have to be too much, but just knowing that someone is on their side can make a huge difference.", "This is my Mom's issue. Spent her whole life taking care of others (siblings first, then her kids), and had no clue what to do with herself when we all grew up. I did encourage her to get a hobby some years ago but she didn't know what she liked to do, now she spends all her time at church.", "Yeah, try the Bil.", "Yes she'll never listen to OP, her little sister. Wonder if their dad would be able to discuss it with her since she's seems to be so obsessed with males, or is OP's sister amplifying some messages she herself received growing up?\n\n\nOP is 8 years younger. Wonder what her parents were like. *IF* they were problematic, the family dynamic could have changed enormously between OP and her sister's births. Maybe they could help. Or even just give their granddaughter more support and attention at least.\n\nEdit:. Sister", "Hmmmmm. Like it.", "At a certain point it will only alienate the sister and the OP might lose access to the niece. And frankly, that\u2019s more important than just calling an AH an AH.", "Can you talk to your husbands sisters (who want nothing to do with their mom) and point out how your sisters doing the same thing to her daughter as their mom did? Maybe hearing it from them and seeing the fallout from how their mom treated them will get through.\n\nGood luck op and congratulations on the new little one. Please try and include your niece as much as you can. She needs a mother figure who actually sees her.", "Agreed. The niece is what\u2019s important here. Need to keep an eye on the backlash."]}
