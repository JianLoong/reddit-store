My sister has been married to Kevin since she was 18 and has four kids with him who are 8, 6, 5 and 3. Her oldest two and her youngest are boys and her 5 year old is a girl. My sister has always complained about her MIL being too in her husband's business, being too possessive of her husband and doesn't respect her as the mother of her grandchildren or her son's wife. She has also mentioned how her husband's two sisters have nothing to do with their mom because she heavily favored her boys and never took the same level of interest in them.\n\nThis is 100% my sister. She is one of those boy moms who talks about girls one day taking her babies away from her, how she'll be dad's mom and never see grandkids, how her boys won't need her as much when they get older and how sad it makes her. She posts all sorts of memes about that and has even made some videos for her Instagram where she talks about boy mom life and has cried on videos saying she'll miss her boys when they move out and get married. My niece is the only child she never mentions in these videos. She has never talked about a future son in law taking her baby girl away from her or anything like that. She even cried to our mom a couple of times about how she's going to have her babies leave her one day and not want to be her little guys anymore. A couple of times when she has brought this stuff up to me I have asked her why she's just sad about her boys growing up or why she'd want them to have the same relationship as now in 20 years. She always ignores me.\n\nI have two kids myself. My son is 2.5 and my daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm excited for them to grow and be amazing people. But I also enjoy the moments we have now and I feel as though my job as their mom and my husband's as their dad is to help them grow into amazing people while also caring for their needs while they are too little to do that for themselves. \n\nA couple of days ago my niece was with me for the day and she asked me if I was sad that I had a girl this time. I told her no, that I love my daughter and would not trade her for the world. I asked her why she'd ask me that and she said she feels like her mommy wishes she was a boy too and how her mom prefers her brothers. She also mentioned her mom not spending time with her and she asked me to speak to her mom for her.\n\nI spoke to my sister yesterday and told her my niece was feeling neglected and maybe she should spend some time with her. She waved that off and then I saw she was posting again about boy moms and saying she will always be #1 woman in their lives. I told her she needs to cut that stuff out because it's creepy and she is shaping up to be the MIL from hell and just like her own MIL she hates so much.

It\u2019s not always perfect, and MIL rears the emotional incest monster as much as she can, but we try to keep it in check.", "How about his sister? Could you get an army of aunties together to help your niece?", "OP that's because your sister doesn't want a daughter and she'll most likely not claim her daughter until she wants to play mother of the bride or grandma to her sons.\n\nIf she could trade her daughter for another son she would. No, she won't admit it but her actions have confirmed it.\n\nI also believe that your sister and her mother-in-law, DECIDED to become a \"boy mom\"...was in order to be \"picked over other women\", by a male. \n\nConfirmation #1, your sister is already obsessing over claiming the top position in her sons' lives. \n\nConfirmation #2, she sees any other woman in her sons lives as a threat. \"She feels threatened by a future wife\n\nConfirmation #3, she views loving her own daughter as stealing her attention away from her sons. She's obsessed with racking up points from her sons, that's another reason why she ignores your niece. In her twisted mind, she's telling herself that she has to show her loyalty to her sons like this in order to win.", "Your sister might come around on her daughter when she\u2019s a teenager, but I\u2019m going to tell you the truth: it\u2019s too late. Your niece has already realized. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t want a girl. Not at all. But me, her second child that she planned, was a girl. I spent 16 years of my life hearing about how my mom never, ever wanted a girl. Ever. She only wanted boys. She gets along better with boys. She never wanted children, but then when she started having them, she only wanted BOYS. \n\nAnd at 16, she walked into my room one day while I was laying in bed late at night, trying to sleep, crying, and said, \u201cI realize that God gave you to me to make me understand that I *do* like having a daughter. That\u2019s why He sent you to me. To make me realize I do.\u201d\n\nSweet, right? But it was too late. I\u2019d known since I was 6 that I, however planned, was not wanted. I wasn\u2019t wanted as much as my brother who she had on accident at 18. I just wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t begrudge my brother that, but when he died, my mom made sure to tell me he was her favorite. She said it was a joke later, but our relationship was already damaged. I knew she didn\u2019t want me after telling me, sometimes indirectly, sometimes very direct and harshly, that I wasn\u2019t what she wanted. \n\nYour niece knows that. A lot of kids don\u2019t come back from that. Many parents act worse to their unwanted child in their moments of intense grief. \n\nThere will be a great chance that this will be your niece\u2019s life. You\u2019ve done a great thing \u2014 standing up to her and bringing it to your sister\u2019s attention. Nobody ever did that for me, in all the times I cried, asking why my mother just didn\u2019t like me. But your sister is not going to change for a long time, likely. And you HAVE to be there to remind that child that she\u2019s wanted. Validate her every time she tells you this. This poor baby deserves that. Trust me. She will look at you all different if you don\u2019t validate her. I only ever got to be a lesson, but you have an opportunity to treat your niece as something better.", "I would have done the same... it is the most obvious tactic to try to bring some empathy out of her, sadly it did not work.\nDo you think this has to do with this social media trend? Did she have problems with internalized misoginy before becoming a \"boys mom\"? Is it because her husband is so close to her mother, as if she felt lonely and were using her sons to fill that gap? Does she have a life, hobbies or a personality outside of being a \"boys mom\"? (Sorry if that sounds harsh, but tbh...)\nI think is going to be very detrimental for everyone if she keeps going down this road, not only for your niece. I am so so sorry for her, it is heartbreaking, because this is probably destroying her self esteem and is going to create a ton of problems for her. I am not a therapist, but talking from sort of a similar experience, and it messed me up in all sorts of ways. The sooner she gets professional help, the better, ideally tomorrow. Best if your sister goes too, or family therapy, idk.", "I'd love to be wrong about this but I don't think this is purely an issue that can be logically reasoned into a good solution. I think sister would need to voluntarily put herself through doing the work of gaining several decades worth of emotional maturity\n\nIt sounds like sister is treating ALL of her children in a way that's entirely inappropriate. Enmeshing herself with the boys and preemptively preparing to treat any hint of them developing age appropriate independence as a tragedy she's the victim of. And rejecting/neglecting the girl for the supposed flaw of being \"too independent\" to fill the role of a helpless doll that makes her mommy feel important. \n\nMy father wasn't quite a carbon copy of this but he definitely shared the trait of treating me as a source to get his emotional needs met instead of focusing on meeting/supporting mine. I can say from experience that talking about the problem didn't work and only caused more hurt. \n\nIf anyone's interested in learning more about this dynamic I can't give a strong enough recommendation to \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\" by Lindsay Gibson", "Sister sounds actively uninterested", "Spot on!

There are a few ways this could go. And none of them are good. They could potentially really buy into their mom's emotional neediness and never be mature or emotionally independent enough to have real romantic relationships. They could completely remove themselves from the family when they get sick of their mom's weirdness. They could grow up not realizing how obsessed she really is and then find themselves having to choose between their future partners and their mother.  \n\nNo matter how it goes, your sister is doing permanent damage to her children right now.

I was just sick of my options being to shut up and pretend everything was okay and I never disagreed or get into nasty fights constantly, and being put between her and my dad (which has always been a constant from both of them, even as an adult). I was just sick of it and it all hit at once. My brother died 6 years ago, and after she said that shit about him being her favorite I just stopped trying to have real conversations for 5 years with her because i was sick of the fighting.

The more we talk, the more it's like the people we each knew as parents are two entirely different sets of people with the same names, because we knew them in such different phases of their lives.", "Big Oedipus energy", "It makes me think that he is with the sister because he saw similar qualities in her to his mummy.", "And invite mom along--maybe if it's a fun girls' day she'll come along and since the boys aren't there maybe she'll pay some attention to her daughter?", "NTA. I feel for your niece. Maybe show your sister this sub? Maybe that will get into her head shes being an AH to her daughter. Her boys should join in too and tell her she needs to have fun with their sister too. Include her as much as possible. I couldn't see myself only loving one child and not the other. I have 3 daughters. I love each of them the same and treat them with the same fairness, discipline and love. Maybe try to plan a day for the ladies (you, your sis, her daughter and your daughter) to go out and have fun together. Or could leave your daughter with someone since she is so young.", "NTA, your poor niece! Maybe see if she can sleepover at your house a weekend or two a month, and maybe come over for dinner once or twice a week. I know that more work for you, especially with two very little ones yourself, however if you can manage to spend more time with your niece, it would probably do her a world of good. To be with someone who actually cares about her. Can you get your parents involved and have them talk to your sister/also spend more time with your niece? Good luck with everything dear! And congratulations on your little one!", "NTA, and holy shit, what your niece said us heartbreaking. For a 5 year old to already feel like they were born a disappointment is horrific. Tbh, I dont think you'd be in the wrong for contacting CPS, depending on how bad the situation is.", "NTA\n\nThere are parents that make their whole identity into being just a parent and in your sisters case a \"boy mom\" which then leaves out her daughter and unfortunately anything that challenges her view on her identity is going to be ignored or cause anger. \n\nYou sound to be the type of parent that sees being a parent as part of your identity not your whole identity and that's why you can be like yea I need to raise my kids and want them to grow up and live happy lives because that's what a parent should do. \n\nMaybe try to be the loving aunt and possibly \"mother figure\" when appropriate and possible for your niece. I know you've said you wished your sister would but I don't think she will unless something huge happens to make her see that her being a boy mom isn't her sole identity. \n\nAlso keep in mind that if you start to see physical neglect or even abuse then CPS should be called. Or even if your niece keeps saying she feels unwanted or unloved. That's makes me wonder if there's already emotional and mental neglect/abuse happening. They often will try to place with family first and you could offer to take her in.", "DEFINITELY NTA. As someone who grew up with a mom who wished I was a boy (like my brothers), thank you for saying something! It sucks that she ignored what you said, but at least you can be a role model for your niece and she can have some positive female influence in her life. Would mentioning her behaviour to your own parents/mother be helpful? You're younger than her and that makes it easier to dismiss what you're saying, but if mom/grandma comments on it, maybe she will listen. When I was a young child, I asked my grandma if my aunt hated me, and oh boy, she tore INTO her. I think also mentioning that it is emotional neglect and therefore child abuse would help.", "Well, that explains why BIL married the sister. He wanted someone like his mom. Sadly, I doubt he'll be any help.", " NTA THAT poor little girl. I hope you can be the person she can go to rest of her life. She\u2019s going to need you at 18.", "NTA\n\nBut your aporoach is wrong.\n\nWho cares about her \"boy mom\" shit -- that will die.\n\nFocus on how she needs to spend more time with her daughter.", "NTA", "He\u2019s likely not intervening because it\u2019s the same dynamic as his family; he thinks it\u2019s normal. His mom prefers the boys and his sisters have gone LC with the mom. \n\nOr, he\u2019s completely checked out", "You are the aunt that everyone remembers having their back when no one else noticed their struggle. Keep it up! bond with niece and let her know youre in her corner. \n\n& Smh your sister sounds..well.", "Oh its definitely worth a try.  There's no harm in doing that", "Your sister needs marriage counseling. Her husband isn\u2019t emotionally available to your sister because he has his mom in #1 spot so your sister is compensating by leaning on her sons instead of her husband. It\u2019s all very dysfunctional but will require marriage counseling in my opinion.", "Maybe talk to her husband regarding what your niece said, he could talk to her?\nEDIT: NTA", "I cry like that tho I don\u2019t have children or have even completed school but I cry over both girls and boys so aita too", "My MIL loves her 3 boys so much more then her 2 daughters. It\u2019s embarrassing. SIL hubby actually thinks it\u2019s funny and he thinks MIL loves middle son the most because he looks like FIL. \n\nMIL literally cancelled dinner plans with us last minute because the thought middle boy would invite her out. He forgot so they sat at home alone. \n\nMIL bought all the boys brand new cars. Daughters got squat. \n\nMiddle boy has two kids. Son gets all the attention and daughter gets none from MIL. \n\nPeople like this can\u2019t change.  It\u2019s in there DNA. Spend time with niece.", "oh my god shes 5 and already questioning if shes loved?! that breaks my heart!  \n\n\nNTA!!!!", "NTA- that being established, I hope you can create a haven for your niece where she feels the love and doesn\u2019t feel too small due for constant comparison. Have her come around more often to be a big sister to your new born and she\u2019ll turn out to be the cool cousin to your baby girl. Talking to your sister may do little change. She\u2019s so far down that hole seeing as she\u2019s not prioritized her baby girl for that long. So maybe just try to deconstruct the ideas your niece is dealing with by counter action to show her healthy mom- daughter relationships", "Whatever the MILs name is, I would start responding to every single comment your sister makes with a \u201coh, didn\u2019t realize we had Mini-Evelyn in the room\u201d or \u201cokay Evelyn\u201d.  Then I would be waiting until your BIL and sister are together and start asking about his sisters.  When they started feeling neglected, how that looked for them when they were growing up, when they started cutting out their mom, etc.  and keep an eye on your niece- it\u2019s disgusting what your sister is doing to all her children, but especially her daughter", "I wonder if you became the guardian of your niece, if they would even care that she's gone? Is that something you'd be willing to do? Sounds like your niece would be better off living with you.", "I bet that was an\u2026interesting time for your mom.", "actually get BIL sisters' involved perhaps they can share their trauma growing up with a mom who blatantly favors their boy siblings.", "NTA", "I feel really bad for your niece, please show her extra love that little girl is in need of it.", "NTA, but please, please, please protect your niece. This is only going to get worse. She will be blamed for things, and the boys won't value her either. Your sister is awful,  really awful.", "NTA. \n\nYour poor neice.\n\nI hope she gains the confidence she isn't receiving.", "I know my mom loves me more than literally anyone else in the world. I know my dad is the same. I have full knowledge my parents love me (and my now passed sister) more than anything else and I don\u2019t have to question it. Until I got into Reddit I never realized how good I had it.  I can yell you\u2019re a good mom and aunt and I believe that advocating for children is barely ever the wrong the to do. NTA", "NTA, but don't delude yourself that your sister will listen to the truth.  Even 20 years from now, when your niece wants nothing to do with her, and she asks you \"Why does my daughter treat me this way?\"  \n\n\nEdited to add: It might get through to her if you tell her what Niece said about thinking people are sad to have baby girls.  Because then it's \"Look how your daughter feels\" and not \"Look what you are doing and saying.\"", "NTA. Poor niece being left out because she's a little girl. If shes only 5 and already seeing the unfairness and loneliness... I shudder to think what she'll say or do if any of her kids have gender dysphoria.\n\nPlease keep looking out for your niece and encourage your nephews to stand up for their sister. Hopefully your sister will realise what an AH she's being.", "Do you think your sister would notice if your niece moved in with you?", "Save all of those videos and future ones. Keep them stored on a PC somewhere. One day when sis goes on a rant about being all alone and her kids abandoning her send her the videos and remind her why.\n\nOr share similar videos to the ones your sisters been posting and call out how mortifying that attitude is and how embarrassing it is to have that kind of video online, who in their right mind would post something like that etc etc. Though i doubt your sis would get the subtlety and if you called out her videos she'd probably keep niece away from you and make it worse for her.", "It rather sounds like he married a woman who is just like his mother, but it's worth a shot to try to get through to her through him.", "That's kind of what I was thinking. Every time OP sees a boy mom \ud83e\udd22 post, she needs to add a comment about the daughter. \"Did you forget you have a daughter again?\" etc, and say something about the daughter's accomplishments. Her sister is going to make her boy's lives miserable as they grow older. God forbid they bring a girl to the house! She'll make an ass of herself trying to compete with them for her baby boys love. She'll also wear a long, white, lacy dress to their weddings."]}
