My sister has been married to Kevin since she was 18 and has four kids with him who are 8, 6, 5 and 3. Her oldest two and her youngest are boys and her 5 year old is a girl. My sister has always complained about her MIL being too in her husband's business, being too possessive of her husband and doesn't respect her as the mother of her grandchildren or her son's wife. She has also mentioned how her husband's two sisters have nothing to do with their mom because she heavily favored her boys and never took the same level of interest in them.\n\nThis is 100% my sister. She is one of those boy moms who talks about girls one day taking her babies away from her, how she'll be dad's mom and never see grandkids, how her boys won't need her as much when they get older and how sad it makes her. She posts all sorts of memes about that and has even made some videos for her Instagram where she talks about boy mom life and has cried on videos saying she'll miss her boys when they move out and get married. My niece is the only child she never mentions in these videos. She has never talked about a future son in law taking her baby girl away from her or anything like that. She even cried to our mom a couple of times about how she's going to have her babies leave her one day and not want to be her little guys anymore. A couple of times when she has brought this stuff up to me I have asked her why she's just sad about her boys growing up or why she'd want them to have the same relationship as now in 20 years. She always ignores me.\n\nI have two kids myself. My son is 2.5 and my daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm excited for them to grow and be amazing people. But I also enjoy the moments we have now and I feel as though my job as their mom and my husband's as their dad is to help them grow into amazing people while also caring for their needs while they are too little to do that for themselves. \n\nA couple of days ago my niece was with me for the day and she asked me if I was sad that I had a girl this time. I told her no, that I love my daughter and would not trade her for the world. I asked her why she'd ask me that and she said she feels like her mommy wishes she was a boy too and how her mom prefers her brothers. She also mentioned her mom not spending time with her and she asked me to speak to her mom for her.\n\nI spoke to my sister yesterday and told her my niece was feeling neglected and maybe she should spend some time with her. She waved that off and then I saw she was posting again about boy moms and saying she will always be #1 woman in their lives. I told her she needs to cut that stuff out because it's creepy and she is shaping up to be the MIL from hell and just like her own MIL she hates so much. She accused me of talking out of my ass and having no idea what it's like.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682160921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v2ghz/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_shaping_up_to/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister needs therapy and something else to do besides being a mom. I know having a small baby and a little one at home is demanding but try and keep an eye out for your niece.

Get your sister some help.", "NTA- stupid question, but have you talked to your BIL about this? How does he feel? Is he wearing blinders too? Agree with everyone else, you just keep on doing you and spending girl time with your niece. Good luck!", "NTA. I'm 30F and my brother is 31 and my mom is still supporting his antics and is unable to see his flaws and it is not doing my brother any favors. He is not a part of my life because he is an abusive monster but to my mom \"he just had a bad reaction\" or \"is misunderstood\". Mom's like this set their children up for failure. I used to ask my mom why she loved my brother and not me all the time when we were younger but now that I'm older I thank God I had to basically raise myself because my brother and I are completely different people and I would much rather be me. You're doing the right thing by looking out for your niece, I hope you're there for her when she's older too, even if you and your sister end up falling out of touch.", "NTA. Your sister is very weird, and that sounds like a recipe for driving all of them away as they grow. I think you did what you safely could by talking to her and should encourage her to bond with her daughter but be careful about the MIL comparisons. She sounds the type to blow up and reject you, and your niece really needs you to give her love from a normal female relative who can model healthy values.", "NTA\n\nWhat is her husband like? Could you approach him with what your daughter has said? Could he give her a little more attention and love since her mum neglects her?", "NTA, I'd start showing up and taking my niece out for play dates.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a nightmare! I don\u2019t think you can do anything to change her though. She clearly favors boys and is already destroying her daughter\u2019s confidence at 5 years old. Best you can do is be there for your niece like you are doing, show her girls are worthwhile. Would not be surprised if she ends up feeling more like part of your family unit than her own.", "NTA. Sounds like she has some sort of daddy + mommy issues. I would suggest you be present more in life of your niece because she needs you and will need you even more.", " NTA at all but your sister is. If she won\u2019t listen talk to Kevin maybe he can give her some extra attention.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think you are going to get through to your sister.

You should be there for your niece either way. \n\nHopefully raising your kids right around their cousins will lead to them calling mom out once they see how you treat both of your children with equal amounts of love.", "NTA.

It might be time for him to step up, too.", "NTA Your sister's behavior is borderline disturbing, hopefully someone can talk her into getting therapy.\n\nIronically, those boys will feel suffocated and probably not have much contact with her when they're older.
