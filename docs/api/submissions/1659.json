Report him, get him arrested, whatever you can do. Also, if he does try to get in touch with you, document it and keep record. It would help later if the police do get him.", "You were assaulted. If you\u2019re in doubt about the safety of calling back, call the police.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Call the police and make a report. You were sexually assaulted. I'm so sorry that happened to you.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds scary and you're definitely justified waiting until you can talk to someone when they're open.", "NTA\n\nDo not engage with whoever\u2019s calling you. There\u2019s no good reason to do so and plenty of good reason not to. Call the official number instead.", "NTA. Assault is not \u201cjust playing.\u201d", "NTA. That was not \"just playing\". That's sexual assault!!! Report him! And if he manages somehow to contact you, **record him**/keep whatever evidence you can get.", "NTA\n\nA man chose to sexually assault you. That is not \"just playing.\" That is being an AH.\n\nGood on you. At very least someone (he) needs to learn what is an acceptable joke.", "NTA, the man wanted to play? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. This type of \"playing\" is so far out of line. I love men but, not this type of sexist AH man.", "NTA. It\u2019s assault. He will continue to do this to others until he faces consequences", "So he thinks it's fine to assault someone, as long as he says he's 'playing'??  What is wrong with people...  NTA - push this as far as you can and teach him this is not ok.", "NTA. That's not playing, that's assault, as others have noted. Definitely don't talk to anyone at the partnership until Monday. Get their name and job title before you say anything else.\n\nI'd also file a police report, which would hopefully trigger a request for any video of the incident. (I presume most cities with a downtown partnership and rent-a-cops on Segways are blanketed with CCTV cameras.)", "He was \"just playing\" because you called him out.\n\nNTA, and I would also report the calls you were getting ASAP because if it were an official call they would've stated who they are. Better safe than sorry.\n\nEdit: Spacing/grammar", "NTA!!! Horrible people like to downplay their terrible behavior and then act as if the victim is overreacting and being too sensitive. I say go through with the whole report. He needs to be held accountable, good luck with it.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let this prick slide.  Who knows how many people he\u2019s assaulted. Fight.", "NTA. He knew what he was doing and will hopefully get what he deserves.", "Yeah. Call the cops.\n\nEdit. NTA obviously.", "NTA.  It is probably him calling you because he found what you put under the door.  Do not respond.  I would call the official office phone number on Monday, ask for the manager and make sure that they got your complaint.  He tried to sexually assault (or did if he did touch you).  That is never a joke or \"playing around\".", "NTA groping and sexual harassment isn't a game. Dude was being gross cause he figured he'd get away with it. Good on for standing up for yourself!", "NTA. And you need to learn what a left hook is as you are screaming get away from me. That person deserves to get in trouble.", "Yeah, call back to the official number. And keep those texts and any voicemails. And the call log. DO NOT ANSWER. This guy wasn\u2019t playing. \n\nNTA", "NTA - HAHA he fucked around and is about to find out that sexual harassments has consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
