He seems to forget about me whenever they are here and I was hoping I would connect with his sister tonight, but after what happened it got awkward. \n\nAnyway, we were at a steakhouse and were chatting about food. His sister picked out a main, I got the drift we weren\u2019t ordering starters. I picked out what I wanted and then I asked both of them what they were planning to get and it was just nice chatting about our food choices and hearing what his sister wouldn\u2019t order. Just before the waiter gets there they sort of talk off to the side, I couldn\u2019t really hear what they were saying but I just let them talk. When the waiter got there, my partner ordered a starter for everyone to share. It was guacamole and some chips, which is great, except that I don\u2019t, and never have, eaten Avo. The texture freaks me out and he\u2019s known this for nearly a year that we have dated. His family love avo and I always say I don\u2019t eat it, even in front of his sister. \n\nNormally I would say something but it was just sprung on me that they were getting a starts so I didn\u2019t get a chance to pick anything. So I decided not to say anything, I wasn\u2019t that hungry and I thought my main was going to be great. \n\nThe starter came and I didn\u2019t pick up a chip when they did and both of them looked at me and I just looked at my boyfriend then the following exchange happened;\n\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t eat avo, remember?\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m fine, I thought it is something you\u2019d remember but I really am fine I ate a nice lunch today\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cOkay, sorry then\u201d \n\nNot going to lie it was an awkward moment. I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026 \n\nLater that evening, when my boyfriend and I got home with the rest of dinner going of okay. He said I was in the wrong and should have said something. I just told him how he forgot and I was fine. I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town but I recognise that, that was the wrong time to bring it up. He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment after some back and forth. \n\nMaybe I should have just said something? I really was fine.

Just because they ordered a starter doesn't mean you are obligated to eat it! I love stuffed mushrooms, but my ex and my children didn't like them. So they would order starters they would eat, and I'll order one that I would eat. I didn't say, \"I ordered this starter for everyone, NOW EAT IT!\"", "NTA. But why is your bf turning it into a thing? You handled it as well as you could imo. Weird that he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment over some guac.", "Them talking off to the side isn't cool. I don't see a problem with them ordering guacamole. I say this as a person who hates guacamole, but my husband loves it. If you didn't have time to order an appetizer, you could always call the waiter back over to your table. It's very easy to add something to a ticket. I waited tables for years, so it is not a problem for the wait staff outside of the fact you might have to wait a few minutes. I feel like you two are overthinking this one.", "\"Actually, I don't eat avocado.  In addition to their appetizer, could I get X for myself?\"   \n\n\nMy husband and I have been married for over 20 years and were together for several before we married (yes, I'm old).   I'm the pickiest eater in the house (and we're a neurodiverse household, so that's saying a lot).   Sometimes, even after all this time, hubby will forget something I don't eat, especially if he's stressed.   It's not a commentary on our relationship so much as a commentary on his mental state in the moment.   I don't think you should be annoyed/offended that he seems to forget things more often when his mom/sister are in town--he's more stressed, more distracted.  It's not a reflection of your relationship so much as a reflection of his distraction.  Just order what you want to eat, or simply ask 'were we getting starters or no?'", "It\u2019s weird this was even an issue. So what you don\u2019t eat avocado? Who cares? They order what they want you don\u2019t eat any.. who cares? And why would you care they ordered it? Why would you even comment and say remember I don\u2019t eat that?

This is a lot of drama over a starter (and I\u2019m a hardcore avocado hater).", "INFO: How often does he see his mom and sister?", "ESH\n\nI was initially going to say N-T-A, but honestly, the more I re-read and think about this, the weirder and more passive-aggressively obnoxious you seem to have behaved about something that should have been a non-issue.\n\nYou claim (over and over) that you were \"fine, really, I was fine\" about the whole thing, but you obviously weren't: you made passive-aggressive comments about how you \"thought he'd remember that you don't eat avocado\"; and you followed up after the restaurant by turning it into a whole discussion, not just about how he's supposed to remember which foods you do and do not like, but tying his being forgetful about \"a few key details about \\[you\\]\" (yikes) SPECIFICALLY to the presence of his family . . . when literally nothing you've said suggested that his sister or her behaviour had anything to do with any of this. It sounds like you're trying to blame his family because he's . . . forgetful? Which is just ugly and problematic, especially when he seems genuinely confused that you didn't just open your mouth and use your big girl words to say, \"Hey, I actually would rather not have guac, could we get something else?'\n\nAnd what's with this:\n\n>I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026\n\nYou \"tried to reconnect\" by making negative comments about what THEY were eating (but you were not) and just . . . echoing what they were saying? Do you have any idea how weird and awkward and not-normal that sounds?\n\nESH because the polite thing to do when ordering a starter for the table is to ask everyone if they're good with what's been chosen. But in the end, even if he was just ordering for him and his sister because they were both craving guacamole, that's hardly the end of the world. Your BF clearly expected that you'd say something if you wanted something, and instead you seem determined to make everything complicated, weird, and exhausting.", "ESH.\n\nIt's fine to not eat a group starter.\n\nIt would have been ok to ask \"hey does anyone mind if I get an appetizer\" either right away or when the guacamole came, if you wanted one.\n\nIt's weird to make it about not liking avocado when not being hungry is just as much a reason for not munching, and weirder to make a big deal of his not remembering.  (Ideally he'd remember, sure, but he can't go back in time.)  And \"talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better\" is just downright strange when you're not eating it, and possibly comes across like passive-aggressive digs at your bf rather than trying to connect.\n\nIt's a bit weird for your bf to blame you for not speaking up sooner -- standard etiquette for group appetizers is for the person ordering to check if it's okay -- but food preferences aren't really \"key details\".", "Info- why not just munch on chips without the guacamole?", "ESH\n\nLet's be honest - you were passive agressive because you were upset he forgot.  He is also being passive agressive by using the silent treatment.", "So. A group of 4 can't eat a starter because you don't like a part of it? You could have still have chips. You seem to have an issue when your bf is with his family, why does everything have to turn around you all the time? I am sorry but reading this more than once comes as you being very dominant. Your bf could have chosen a different starter? Yes, could you have said something in a no dramatic way? Yes.

He probably feels bad for forgetting about it and is upset at him self.", "YTA for the passive aggressive sulking.  If you don't like the starter, don't eat it.  There is no need to make this a judgment on your boyfriend's investment in your relationship because you can't say 'I'll wait for the mains' or even 'No thank you.'  Not every starter has to be palatable to everyone.  Maybe they just wanted guac.", "In general people with the food hangups are TA. If everyone is having a good time don't be over there in the corner with your list of objections.", "How do you know the texture freaks you out if you have never eaten it?", "NTA at all but it is really weird to say \u2018avo\u2019.

And what's with the \" I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town\" - what did you think would happen?\n\nThen again, the silent treatment?\n\nAnd all for, essentially, nothing?", "ESH.\n\nThey didn't ensure that you agreed with the proposed shared starter (having already forgotten you didn't like it).\n\nYour responses to him were what made it awkward. Having read it, I'm honestly confused whether you didn't want a starter or were peeved you didn't get chance to order a starter. If you'd wanted a starter, you could have asked for an extra minute or two to look at the menu ('Sorry, can I have another minute, I don't eat guacamole and I'm still deciding on my starter'), or glanced at it whilst the others ordered their mains. If you really didn't feel the need for a starter, when it was served you could have dismissed it with a softer comment like 'I'm fine, I'm leaving room for the main course. I'm still a bit full from lunch, otherwise I would have ordered a starter myself.' \n\nIt seems both of you need to work on communication.", "ESH there didn't need to be a passive agressive comment, you can have a chip without guac or you could have called the wait staff back and ordered something different.  In the grand scheme of things, this should have been a non issue for everyone.", "I am so glad to not be in a relationship where literally nothing gets turned into a whole Reddit post.

Speak up and order yourself a \u201cstarter\u201d if you don\u2019t like what they got. The premise of oh I didn\u2019t know they were getting starters, ok so what? You could have said oh shoot I need a minute to decide, can you please come back for my order then? Not a big deal at all. \n \nThe whole thing honestly sounds really dumb and sometimes we have to choose our battles. If your uncomfortable with how he treats you around his family I would just end the relationship. You don\u2019t want to be dealing with this issue for the rest of your life. Obviously he values his relationship with his family, and that\u2019s great. He should treat you the same if they are there or not, and always try to include you in the conversation.", "YTA Life happens, in the scheme of things keeping track of others food preferences is annoying.

They ordered something you didn't like, so you didn't eat it. \n\nSaying you don't eat something in response to someone wondering why you aren't digging in isn't an AH thing to do.", "Yes say something, always! Hes not a mindreader. He clearly doesn't remember you don't like AVOCADO. So you definitely should have said something. It would have been less awkward and you all could have picked an appetizer.

It is his family and so it is his job to make sure you are treated well . He failed and is trying to place the blame on you by asking why you didn't speak up.

I don't know how real this is, maybe they are excluding you or maybe you are thinking things are more awkward than they are, but this disagreement doesn't seem to be about avocado and chips.\nTalk to your boyfriend about feeling insecure when his family comes into town; you don't want to seperate him from his family at all, you just want his help in bonding more closely with them and being more involved when they visit.", "YTA not for not eating the starter but because of how you reacted, I also don't eat guacamole because of the texture but I still nibble on the chips, or you could have ordered another starter for yourself to share with the table that you liked.

I would also remember what other people can't eat because I have shit I can't/won't eat and that means I'm aware it's an issue.

It is not worth it, despite the societal conditioning you\u2019ve gone through that has taught you that having a man, any man, no matter how good or bad or apathetic and uncaring or even abusive towards you, is more important than anything.

Millions of women have gone down that road of looking past early indicators of a man\u2019s true character and how he will treat you and it\u2019s not pretty. This IS a red flag. They were rude to you. He was knowingly selfish and excluding you and purposely left you out of the conversation for literally no good reason (literally what is the point of not giving you a chance to order a different appetizer that you would enjoy?

All red flags), then he effectively gaslit you by saying \u201cyOu DiDnT SaY AnYThiNg.\u201d And then further gaslit you by being cold and distant towards you as if YOU did something wrong, when you were nicer than his behavior warranted and you even said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d to keep the peace at the table when it wasn\u2019t fine.

I wasn't mad that he didn't spend a whole lot, I was mad that every fucking year he forgets that I can't eat chocolate. OP's problem is the same problem. How many times does OP have to tell someone that she doesn't like or eat avocados.\n\nIf her boyfriend wants to be mad, he needs to be mad at himself. He's acting like a jackhole.", "Lol what? Saying \"oh I don't eat avocado\" *when they order it* would be so much more awkward. At that point it would be in front of the waiter too, plus you'd be *assuming* they meant to share it with you. \n\nAs it is I'd handle the situation exactly the same. In my head: oh, I didn't know we were doing starters, I don't like what they're getting but I didn't look at those and there isn't time now. Oh well no big deal I'm not super hungry anyway.\n\nLet it slide because genuinely it ain't a big deal. Remind them only when they look at me expectantly. Then (???) when they make a huge deal about it because seriously. Not worth the brain space wtf.", "Both are extremely dramatic over chips and dip. It's just not worth a fight in my book.", "That\u2019s a lot of drama for someone who didn\u2019t want anything", "Australia seems to love nothing more than [forming the diminutive of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutives_in_Australian_English).", "NZ too", "I get the impression that the sister ordered first and only selected a main, OP ordered next thinking they weren't going to get starters and also order just a main, OP's boyfriend ordered last and chose the starter for the table.", "[removed]", "It's pretty common to say avo here in Australia! I don't know where OP is from, but it could account for it.", "Did OP even want an appetizer? She didn\u2019t need to order something she didn\u2019t want to be polite. The only sense in which OP was an AH is that she thought her boyfriend needed to remember she doesn\u2019t like guac.", "?? OP doesn't have to get a starter if they don't want to?", "She made it weird it sounds like if she was making similar comments to them about how it tasted, when she never ate any.", "They both do.", "COUGHincelCOUGH", "Ok? This could have been your own comment.", "Where did the OP say he wasn't allowed to order it for himself? He ordered it \"for the table\" (which would include OP) without consulting her, then was upset when SHE didn't eat it. She didn't bring up not liking it until he was annoyed at her for not eating it. She never said he and his sister couldn't eat it. \n\nOrdering some guacamole for himself isn't the problem. Ordering it for someone else without consulting them and then getting annoyed when they didn't eat it is rude.\n\nBringing up such a nonsequential thing hours later, starting an argument and giving your partner the silent treatment over it is just childish.", "But he\u2019s not speaking to her so it seems like he\u2019s mad.", "The sister doesn\u2019t seem mad but the boyfriend is very oddly angry. Like who cares if she doesn\u2019t eat it, more for the other 2!", "Or \u201chey, we want to get guac, do you want queso or something else?\u201d", "I have zero problem with them ordering guac. \nIt\u2019s the Underhanded behavior that\u2019s just odd, IMO.", "Especially without finding fault in her for not handling it \"perfectly \"", "That face that she didn\u2019t say anything doesn\u2019t matter here though, cause she made it clear she didn\u2019t mind not eating a starter. Sure she had a \u201che doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d Moment, but then quickly realized herself it wasn\u2019t a big deal.", "This. There\u2019s a clear undertone of jealousy in OP\u2019s post of her bf\u2019s family. This is a huge red flag. She was already postured to be let down before anything even started when the bf was talking with his own sister. He can whisper about whatever he wants, it\u2019s his sister. Who knows what they were saying. He didn\u2019t order sardines, he ordered the most commonly ordered app at this type of restaurant. \n\nHe only got annoyed in response to her being annoyed. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand that OP would have been annoyed after dinner. So in response the bf got annoyed that she hadn\u2019t done the adult thing and speak up. Speak up next time. Super strange everyone\u2019s conveniently failing to read between the gaping lines.", "So glad you posted this. Like, is OP not a grown women?? My husband and his buddy always order starters that have cheese (I'm lactose intolerant) and guess what? I'm a grown women who orders something she likes.", "she didn't even know they were ordering starters", "I'm not sure I agree. OP didn't want a starter and the other two didn't discuss starters, so OP would've had to say something immediately AFTER the sister ordered the guac and chips. The others didn't discuss the starter that was expected to be shared by everyone (they didn't ask everyone because they didn't ask OP) and OP didn't want a starter anyways so... why is OP TA? If someone ordered a starter I won't eat when I didn't want a starter in the first place, it is a non-issue. Until boyfriend got mad OP wouldn't eat the starter. \n\nWhat I wouldn't do is order a starter for the entire table without TALKING to the others to see if they liked the choice or not.", "Do you think that actually happened???\n\nLike they actually leaned off to the side of the table and quietly whispered to the extent a person sitting next to them couldn't hear them at all, or snuck off to the bathroom to secretly order guacamole?", "All the drama was started by the boyfriend.\n\nHe ordered it without consulting her.\n\nHe got upset when she wasn't eating it.\n\nHe was the one who brought it up again when they got home.\n\nHe is the one giving OP the silent treatment over it.\n\nWas OP upset that he forgot she didn't like avocado and ordered it without consulting her? Yes. But she was just going to skip the starter and enjoy her main without saying anything. He's the one who made a big deal over her not eating it. And responding to someone who asks you why you're not eating something with \"I've told you before I don't like [particular food]\" is not causing a scene or creating drama. I've managed to say the exact same thing to people about foods I've repeatedly said I don't like without them throwing a hissy fit and giving me the silent treatment over it.\n\nIt wasn't a thing until the boyfriend made it a thing.", "That\u2019s how I read it. \n\nWhich has *everyone* acting weirdly, or at least OP and BF, if we assume sister didn\u2019t really want the apps, but then BF asked her (weirdly 1-on-1) after he\u2019d ordered the main. BF for both ordering out of order and for side-barring, OP for not ordering an app (if she wanted one, which *still* isn\u2019t clear).", "The sister and OP picking out mains was conversation before the waiter got there. Then the bf started the order by ordering the starter \u201cfor the table\u201d without discussing it beforehand, other than potentially with his sister privately. Which, given that they\u2019d been talking about food already without anyone mentioning starters, was a blindside to OP.\n\nExcept it\u2019s only chips and guac. The bigger issue IMO is that getting a starter slows down the mains. It\u2019s weird waiting for your food while everyone else is nibbling.", "Luckily not everywhere is America.\n\nEdit/my first time ordering in the states I ordered what would be a reasonable number of items back in Aus\u2026then got presented with easily 5kg of food.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She probably just zoned out a bit. \n\nIf this is the drama in your life, you are bored and you need to find better things to do.\n\nESH.", "Yeah.  I have a business dinner every few months with a vendor.  Even they manage to remember I\u2019m allergic to shellfish and always insist on other apps despite me assuring them it\u2019s okay if they want crab cakes - they always order multiple apps, so it\u2019s not like I get nothing.\n\nBut I\u2019d find it hella odd if they started conspiratorial-feeling whispering and then ordered a seafood tower and crab cakes and nothing else.\n\nI know OP is a texture issue and not an allergy, but both are valid reasons not to eat something.  I don\u2019t like cooked carrots that are soft and mushy because the texture weirds me out.\n\nOP\u2019s bf doubling down and given the silent treatment afterwards is also ridiculous and AH behaviour", "We are going based off of OPs story. I've definitely encountered shitty in-laws who would 100% be petty like that. \n\nIt's also possible depending on how loud the restaurant was they could have a conversation that excluded OP, especially if they were sitting beside each other. \n\nAt no point did OP say they left the table to order secret guacamole, only that they decided without her input.", "She didn\u2019t say he got upset that she wasn\u2019t eating it", "I guarantee she was making it a thing. No or cares if you eat guacamole or not", "Yeah I remember being a teenager and eating an entire massive burger and fries, and now it's easily dinner, lunch, and dinner again.

Her being quiet hurt absolutely nobody, except her boyfriend\u2019s ego.", "Okay you, fine internet patron, clearly have never been faced with the social anxiety that comes when everyone else is ordering something and you don\u2019t know what you want. Even if she zoned out they should\u2019ve asked \u201chey OP you good with this?\u201d That\u2019s the polite thing to do.

How fucking earth-shattering?!?!? Whatever shall we do???", "How is she being dramatic?", "Nothing she's doing is dramatic. You, however, sound very judgemental and dramatic about the word avo", "Right?  If anything bf is being dramatic.  She doesn't seem to have actually cared about them ordering the appetizer, she said she was excited for her food.", "Exactly. The same people saying she sucks for not speaking up are the ones who also carry a lot of insecurity. \n\nI get being disappointed in yourself because you wanted to be inclusive, but the hostility and bad attitude show that that wasn\u2019t the primary concern for the boyfriend or for the people in the comments."]}
