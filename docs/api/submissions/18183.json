He seems to forget about me whenever they are here and I was hoping I would connect with his sister tonight, but after what happened it got awkward. \n\nAnyway, we were at a steakhouse and were chatting about food. His sister picked out a main, I got the drift we weren\u2019t ordering starters. I picked out what I wanted and then I asked both of them what they were planning to get and it was just nice chatting about our food choices and hearing what his sister wouldn\u2019t order. Just before the waiter gets there they sort of talk off to the side, I couldn\u2019t really hear what they were saying but I just let them talk. When the waiter got there, my partner ordered a starter for everyone to share. It was guacamole and some chips, which is great, except that I don\u2019t, and never have, eaten Avo. The texture freaks me out and he\u2019s known this for nearly a year that we have dated. His family love avo and I always say I don\u2019t eat it, even in front of his sister. \n\nNormally I would say something but it was just sprung on me that they were getting a starts so I didn\u2019t get a chance to pick anything. So I decided not to say anything, I wasn\u2019t that hungry and I thought my main was going to be great. \n\nThe starter came and I didn\u2019t pick up a chip when they did and both of them looked at me and I just looked at my boyfriend then the following exchange happened;\n\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t eat avo, remember?\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m fine, I thought it is something you\u2019d remember but I really am fine I ate a nice lunch today\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cOkay, sorry then\u201d \n\nNot going to lie it was an awkward moment. I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026 \n\nLater that evening, when my boyfriend and I got home with the rest of dinner going of okay. He said I was in the wrong and should have said something. I just told him how he forgot and I was fine. I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town but I recognise that, that was the wrong time to bring it up. He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment after some back and forth. \n\nMaybe I should have just said something? I really was fine.

Just because they ordered a starter doesn't mean you are obligated to eat it! I love stuffed mushrooms, but my ex and my children didn't like them. So they would order starters they would eat, and I'll order one that I would eat. I didn't say, \"I ordered this starter for everyone, NOW EAT IT!\"", "NTA. But why is your bf turning it into a thing? You handled it as well as you could imo. Weird that he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment over some guac.", "Them talking off to the side isn't cool. I don't see a problem with them ordering guacamole. I say this as a person who hates guacamole, but my husband loves it. If you didn't have time to order an appetizer, you could always call the waiter back over to your table. It's very easy to add something to a ticket. I waited tables for years, so it is not a problem for the wait staff outside of the fact you might have to wait a few minutes. I feel like you two are overthinking this one.", "\"Actually, I don't eat avocado.  In addition to their appetizer, could I get X for myself?\"   \n\n\nMy husband and I have been married for over 20 years and were together for several before we married (yes, I'm old).   I'm the pickiest eater in the house (and we're a neurodiverse household, so that's saying a lot).   Sometimes, even after all this time, hubby will forget something I don't eat, especially if he's stressed.   It's not a commentary on our relationship so much as a commentary on his mental state in the moment.   I don't think you should be annoyed/offended that he seems to forget things more often when his mom/sister are in town--he's more stressed, more distracted.  It's not a reflection of your relationship so much as a reflection of his distraction.  Just order what you want to eat, or simply ask 'were we getting starters or no?'", "It\u2019s weird this was even an issue. So what you don\u2019t eat avocado? Who cares? They order what they want you don\u2019t eat any.. who cares? And why would you care they ordered it? Why would you even comment and say remember I don\u2019t eat that?

This is a lot of drama over a starter (and I\u2019m a hardcore avocado hater).", "INFO: How often does he see his mom and sister?", "ESH\n\nI was initially going to say N-T-A, but honestly, the more I re-read and think about this, the weirder and more passive-aggressively obnoxious you seem to have behaved about something that should have been a non-issue.\n\nYou claim (over and over) that you were \"fine, really, I was fine\" about the whole thing, but you obviously weren't: you made passive-aggressive comments about how you \"thought he'd remember that you don't eat avocado\"; and you followed up after the restaurant by turning it into a whole discussion, not just about how he's supposed to remember which foods you do and do not like, but tying his being forgetful about \"a few key details about \\[you\\]\" (yikes) SPECIFICALLY to the presence of his family . . . when literally nothing you've said suggested that his sister or her behaviour had anything to do with any of this. It sounds like you're trying to blame his family because he's . . . forgetful? Which is just ugly and problematic, especially when he seems genuinely confused that you didn't just open your mouth and use your big girl words to say, \"Hey, I actually would rather not have guac, could we get something else?'\n\nAnd what's with this:\n\n>I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026\n\nYou \"tried to reconnect\" by making negative comments about what THEY were eating (but you were not) and just . . . echoing what they were saying? Do you have any idea how weird and awkward and not-normal that sounds?\n\nESH because the polite thing to do when ordering a starter for the table is to ask everyone if they're good with what's been chosen. But in the end, even if he was just ordering for him and his sister because they were both craving guacamole, that's hardly the end of the world. Your BF clearly expected that you'd say something if you wanted something, and instead you seem determined to make everything complicated, weird, and exhausting.", "ESH.\n\nIt's fine to not eat a group starter.\n\nIt would have been ok to ask \"hey does anyone mind if I get an appetizer\" either right away or when the guacamole came, if you wanted one.\n\nIt's weird to make it about not liking avocado when not being hungry is just as much a reason for not munching, and weirder to make a big deal of his not remembering.  (Ideally he'd remember, sure, but he can't go back in time.)  And \"talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better\" is just downright strange when you're not eating it, and possibly comes across like passive-aggressive digs at your bf rather than trying to connect.\n\nIt's a bit weird for your bf to blame you for not speaking up sooner -- standard etiquette for group appetizers is for the person ordering to check if it's okay -- but food preferences aren't really \"key details\".", "Info- why not just munch on chips without the guacamole?", "ESH\n\nLet's be honest - you were passive agressive because you were upset he forgot.  He is also being passive agressive by using the silent treatment.", "So. A group of 4 can't eat a starter because you don't like a part of it? You could have still have chips. You seem to have an issue when your bf is with his family, why does everything have to turn around you all the time? I am sorry but reading this more than once comes as you being very dominant. Your bf could have chosen a different starter? Yes, could you have said something in a no dramatic way? Yes. You chose to make this a huge deal.", "It sounds like you're asking for relationship advice more than judgment. Not gonna vote either way but I'd say you're in the wrong sub.", "Maybe you should find someone who gives a fuck...", "NTA\n\nIt is something they wanted to get, plus  it is never too late to order something, so if you really wanted something when they ordered, you could have gotten something when the waiter returned.

He probably feels bad for forgetting about it and is upset at him self.", "YTA for the passive aggressive sulking.  If you don't like the starter, don't eat it.  There is no need to make this a judgment on your boyfriend's investment in your relationship because you can't say 'I'll wait for the mains' or even 'No thank you.'  Not every starter has to be palatable to everyone.  Maybe they just wanted guac.", "In general people with the food hangups are TA. If everyone is having a good time don't be over there in the corner with your list of objections.", "How do you know the texture freaks you out if you have never eaten it?", "NTA at all but it is really weird to say \u2018avo\u2019. Sounds like a bf problem not a guacamole problem.", "ESH\n\nReally, \u201cI don\u2019t eat avo, remember?\u201d - a bit passive aggressive, don't you think?  And what's with the \" I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town\" - what did you think would happen?\n\nThen again, the silent treatment?\n\nAnd all for, essentially, nothing?", "ESH.\n\nThey didn't ensure that you agreed with the proposed shared starter (having already forgotten you didn't like it).\n\nYour responses to him were what made it awkward. Having read it, I'm honestly confused whether you didn't want a starter or were peeved you didn't get chance to order a starter. If you'd wanted a starter, you could have asked for an extra minute or two to look at the menu ('Sorry, can I have another minute, I don't eat guacamole and I'm still deciding on my starter'), or glanced at it whilst the others ordered their mains. If you really didn't feel the need for a starter, when it was served you could have dismissed it with a softer comment like 'I'm fine, I'm leaving room for the main course. I'm still a bit full from lunch, otherwise I would have ordered a starter myself.' \n\nIt seems both of you need to work on communication.", "ESH there didn't need to be a passive agressive comment, you can have a chip without guac or you could have called the wait staff back and ordered something different.  In the grand scheme of things, this should have been a non issue for everyone.", "I am so glad to not be in a relationship where literally nothing gets turned into a whole Reddit post.

But you could\u2019ve eaten a couple chips without the avocado and then reminded your boyfriend after you were back home.", "YTA just for calling avocado \"avo\"", "YTA. Speak up and order yourself a \u201cstarter\u201d if you don\u2019t like what they got. The premise of oh I didn\u2019t know they were getting starters, ok so what? You could have said oh shoot I need a minute to decide, can you please come back for my order then? Not a big deal at all. \n \nThe whole thing honestly sounds really dumb and sometimes we have to choose our battles. If your uncomfortable with how he treats you around his family I would just end the relationship. You don\u2019t want to be dealing with this issue for the rest of your life. Obviously he values his relationship with his family, and that\u2019s great. He should treat you the same if they are there or not, and always try to include you in the conversation.", "YTA Life happens, in the scheme of things keeping track of others food preferences is annoying.  You seem to be taking this personally, honestly you could have just snacked on the chips.", "NTA. \n\nWent out to eat, they ordered some food. You ordered some food. They ordered something you didn't like, so you didn't eat it. \n\nSaying you don't eat something in response to someone wondering why you aren't digging in isn't an AH thing to do.", "Yes say something, always! Hes not a mindreader. He clearly doesn't remember you don't like AVOCADO. So you definitely should have said something. It would have been less awkward and you all could have picked an appetizer. Instead your quiet and upset, but communication would have solved this.\n\n\nPlease just call it avocado.

This doesn't mean he shouldn't order it, but it does mean you need to be included in the conversation to voice your wants/needs or he needs to make sure the table also has a starter you can enjoy. It is his family and so it is his job to make sure you are treated well . He failed and is trying to place the blame on you by asking why you didn't speak up.

You could have just eaten the chips (unless it was across the whole top of it), or just politely declined eating any. I don't understand why you and your boyfriend are now having a disagreement over someone choosing to *not* eat something.\n\nIt sounds like what you are actually upset about is feeling like your partner ignores you when his family shows up, and making it more difficult for you to bond with his family as well. I don't know how real this is, maybe they are excluding you or maybe you are thinking things are more awkward than they are, but this disagreement doesn't seem to be about avocado and chips.\nTalk to your boyfriend about feeling insecure when his family comes into town; you don't want to seperate him from his family at all, you just want his help in bonding more closely with them and being more involved when they visit.", "YTA not for not eating the starter but because of how you reacted, I also don't eat guacamole because of the texture but I still nibble on the chips, or you could have ordered another starter for yourself to share with the table that you liked.

It is not worth it, despite the societal conditioning you\u2019ve gone through that has taught you that having a man, any man, no matter how good or bad or apathetic and uncaring or even abusive towards you, is more important than anything.

Millions of women have gone down that road of looking past early indicators of a man\u2019s true character and how he will treat you and it\u2019s not pretty. This IS a red flag. They were rude to you. He was knowingly selfish and excluding you and purposely left you out of the conversation for literally no good reason (literally what is the point of not giving you a chance to order a different appetizer that you would enjoy?

Or they think you\u2019re an idiot and don\u2019t trust that you know what you like and wanted to force you via social pressure to try it because they all love it so much and you must not really know what YOU like? Or are they just that selfish and weird? All red flags), then he effectively gaslit you by saying \u201cyOu DiDnT SaY AnYThiNg.\u201d And then further gaslit you by being cold and distant towards you as if YOU did something wrong, when you were nicer than his behavior warranted and you even said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d to keep the peace at the table when it wasn\u2019t fine.

The boyfriend ordered chips and guacamole presumably because him and his sister enjoys those things. It might be a little selfish for him to momentarily forget his girlfriend\u2019s dietary choices. It\u2019s also a little self-concerned to expect people to be considerate of your unspoken preferences, especially when you\u2019ve verbally expressed that you\u2019re \u201cfine\u201d about it. \n\n> I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better.

This is just\u2026not socially appropriate behavior. \n\n> Later that evening, when my boyfriend and I got home with the rest of dinner going off okay. He said I was in the wrong and should have said something. I just told him how he forgot and I was fine.\n\nAfter they get home, she says she\u2019s fine AGAIN (x2). Clearly she isn\u2019t \u201cfine\u201d if she\u2019s still complaining passive aggressively. You know what normal people do when someone forgets something this trivial? They remind them. If you choose not to say anything, and you\u2019re fine about the situation, *then what is the fucking issue?*\n\n>I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town but I recognise that, that was the wrong time to bring it up.\n\nHow dare he\u2026pay more attention to people he sees less often on the rare occasions when he does see them? People who presumably speak up about what they do or do not want to eat, without some petulant, self-punishing attitude. \n\nShe\u2019s not mad about the avocado, she\u2019s mad about the fact her boyfriend pays more attention to his sister when he sees her (because prior to recently, they lived in separate countries). The boyfriend doesn\u2019t know this though, because she obviously never said so before the guacamole incident. Then she takes this to mean that he doesn\u2019t care about her when in reality, she doesn\u2019t ever express this, and expects him to just *know* that she feels this way. When he notices something is wrong, she doubles down and says she\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d\u2014when clearly she is not fine\u2014and proceeds to double down AGAIN when he gives her yet *another* chance to talk about how she feels. This means she had three chances to say something other than \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, but she instead chose to criticize their dish that she did not eat and does not like, and somehow expects this to be \u201creconnecting\u201d.
