He seems to forget about me whenever they are here and I was hoping I would connect with his sister tonight, but after what happened it got awkward. \n\nAnyway, we were at a steakhouse and were chatting about food. His sister picked out a main, I got the drift we weren\u2019t ordering starters. I picked out what I wanted and then I asked both of them what they were planning to get and it was just nice chatting about our food choices and hearing what his sister wouldn\u2019t order. Just before the waiter gets there they sort of talk off to the side, I couldn\u2019t really hear what they were saying but I just let them talk. When the waiter got there, my partner ordered a starter for everyone to share. It was guacamole and some chips, which is great, except that I don\u2019t, and never have, eaten Avo. The texture freaks me out and he\u2019s known this for nearly a year that we have dated. His family love avo and I always say I don\u2019t eat it, even in front of his sister. \n\nNormally I would say something but it was just sprung on me that they were getting a starts so I didn\u2019t get a chance to pick anything. So I decided not to say anything, I wasn\u2019t that hungry and I thought my main was going to be great. \n\nThe starter came and I didn\u2019t pick up a chip when they did and both of them looked at me and I just looked at my boyfriend then the following exchange happened;\n\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t eat avo, remember?\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m fine, I thought it is something you\u2019d remember but I really am fine I ate a nice lunch today\u201d \n\nHim: \u201cOkay, sorry then\u201d \n\nNot going to lie it was an awkward moment. I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026 \n\nLater that evening, when my boyfriend and I got home with the rest of dinner going of okay. He said I was in the wrong and should have said something. I just told him how he forgot and I was fine. I did try to talk to him about how he doesn\u2019t remember key details about a few things about me when his mom and sister are in town but I recognise that, that was the wrong time to bring it up. He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment after some back and forth. \n\nMaybe I should have just said something? I really was fine.

Just because they ordered a starter doesn't mean you are obligated to eat it! I love stuffed mushrooms, but my ex and my children didn't like them. So they would order starters they would eat, and I'll order one that I would eat. I didn't say, \"I ordered this starter for everyone, NOW EAT IT!\"", "NTA. But why is your bf turning it into a thing? You handled it as well as you could imo. Weird that he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment over some guac.", "Them talking off to the side isn't cool. I don't see a problem with them ordering guacamole. I say this as a person who hates guacamole, but my husband loves it. If you didn't have time to order an appetizer, you could always call the waiter back over to your table. It's very easy to add something to a ticket. I waited tables for years, so it is not a problem for the wait staff outside of the fact you might have to wait a few minutes. I feel like you two are overthinking this one.", "\"Actually, I don't eat avocado.  In addition to their appetizer, could I get X for myself?\"   \n\n\nMy husband and I have been married for over 20 years and were together for several before we married (yes, I'm old).   I'm the pickiest eater in the house (and we're a neurodiverse household, so that's saying a lot).   Sometimes, even after all this time, hubby will forget something I don't eat, especially if he's stressed.   It's not a commentary on our relationship so much as a commentary on his mental state in the moment.   I don't think you should be annoyed/offended that he seems to forget things more often when his mom/sister are in town--he's more stressed, more distracted.  It's not a reflection of your relationship so much as a reflection of his distraction.  Just order what you want to eat, or simply ask 'were we getting starters or no?'", "It\u2019s weird this was even an issue. So what you don\u2019t eat avocado? Who cares? They order what they want you don\u2019t eat any.. who cares? And why would you care they ordered it? Why would you even comment and say remember I don\u2019t eat that?

This is a lot of drama over a starter (and I\u2019m a hardcore avocado hater).", "INFO: How often does he see his mom and sister?", "ESH\n\nI was initially going to say N-T-A, but honestly, the more I re-read and think about this, the weirder and more passive-aggressively obnoxious you seem to have behaved about something that should have been a non-issue.\n\nYou claim (over and over) that you were \"fine, really, I was fine\" about the whole thing, but you obviously weren't: you made passive-aggressive comments about how you \"thought he'd remember that you don't eat avocado\"; and you followed up after the restaurant by turning it into a whole discussion, not just about how he's supposed to remember which foods you do and do not like, but tying his being forgetful about \"a few key details about \\[you\\]\" (yikes) SPECIFICALLY to the presence of his family . . . when literally nothing you've said suggested that his sister or her behaviour had anything to do with any of this. It sounds like you're trying to blame his family because he's . . . forgetful? Which is just ugly and problematic, especially when he seems genuinely confused that you didn't just open your mouth and use your big girl words to say, \"Hey, I actually would rather not have guac, could we get something else?'\n\nAnd what's with this:\n\n>I sat there and didn\u2019t eat but did make comments similar to what they were saying and talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better. Trying to reconnect I guess\u2026\n\nYou \"tried to reconnect\" by making negative comments about what THEY were eating (but you were not) and just . . . echoing what they were saying? Do you have any idea how weird and awkward and not-normal that sounds?\n\nESH because the polite thing to do when ordering a starter for the table is to ask everyone if they're good with what's been chosen. But in the end, even if he was just ordering for him and his sister because they were both craving guacamole, that's hardly the end of the world. Your BF clearly expected that you'd say something if you wanted something, and instead you seem determined to make everything complicated, weird, and exhausting.", "ESH.\n\nIt's fine to not eat a group starter.\n\nIt would have been ok to ask \"hey does anyone mind if I get an appetizer\" either right away or when the guacamole came, if you wanted one.\n\nIt's weird to make it about not liking avocado when not being hungry is just as much a reason for not munching, and weirder to make a big deal of his not remembering.  (Ideally he'd remember, sure, but he can't go back in time.)  And \"talking about how the restaurant could have spiced the avo better\" is just downright strange when you're not eating it, and possibly comes across like passive-aggressive digs at your bf rather than trying to connect.\n\nIt's a bit weird for your bf to blame you for not speaking up sooner -- standard etiquette for group appetizers is for the person ordering to check if it's okay -- but food preferences aren't really \"key details\".", "Info- why not just munch on chips without the guacamole?", "ESH\n\nLet's be honest - you were passive agressive because you were upset he forgot.

You seem to have an issue when your bf is with his family, why does everything have to turn around you all the time? I am sorry but reading this more than once comes as you being very dominant. Your bf could have chosen a different starter? Yes, could you have said something in a no dramatic way? Yes.

He probably feels bad for forgetting about it and is upset at him self.", "YTA for the passive aggressive sulking.  If you don't like the starter, don't eat it.  There is no need to make this a judgment on your boyfriend's investment in your relationship because you can't say 'I'll wait for the mains' or even 'No thank you.'  Not every starter has to be palatable to everyone.  Maybe they just wanted guac.", "In general people with the food hangups are TA. If everyone is having a good time don't be over there in the corner with your list of objections.", "How do you know the texture freaks you out if you have never eaten it?", "NTA at all but it is really weird to say \u2018avo\u2019.

Having read it, I'm honestly confused whether you didn't want a starter or were peeved you didn't get chance to order a starter. If you'd wanted a starter, you could have asked for an extra minute or two to look at the menu ('Sorry, can I have another minute, I don't eat guacamole and I'm still deciding on my starter'), or glanced at it whilst the others ordered their mains. If you really didn't feel the need for a starter, when it was served you could have dismissed it with a softer comment like 'I'm fine, I'm leaving room for the main course. I'm still a bit full from lunch, otherwise I would have ordered a starter myself.' \n\nIt seems both of you need to work on communication.", "ESH there didn't need to be a passive agressive comment, you can have a chip without guac or you could have called the wait staff back and ordered something different.  In the grand scheme of things, this should have been a non issue for everyone.", "I am so glad to not be in a relationship where literally nothing gets turned into a whole Reddit post.

Speak up and order yourself a \u201cstarter\u201d if you don\u2019t like what they got. The premise of oh I didn\u2019t know they were getting starters, ok so what? You could have said oh shoot I need a minute to decide, can you please come back for my order then? Not a big deal at all. \n \nThe whole thing honestly sounds really dumb and sometimes we have to choose our battles. If your uncomfortable with how he treats you around his family I would just end the relationship. You don\u2019t want to be dealing with this issue for the rest of your life. Obviously he values his relationship with his family, and that\u2019s great. He should treat you the same if they are there or not, and always try to include you in the conversation.", "YTA Life happens, in the scheme of things keeping track of others food preferences is annoying.

They ordered something you didn't like, so you didn't eat it. \n\nSaying you don't eat something in response to someone wondering why you aren't digging in isn't an AH thing to do.", "Yes say something, always! Hes not a mindreader. He clearly doesn't remember you don't like AVOCADO. So you definitely should have said something. It would have been less awkward and you all could have picked an appetizer.

It is his family and so it is his job to make sure you are treated well . He failed and is trying to place the blame on you by asking why you didn't speak up.

I don't know how real this is, maybe they are excluding you or maybe you are thinking things are more awkward than they are, but this disagreement doesn't seem to be about avocado and chips.\nTalk to your boyfriend about feeling insecure when his family comes into town; you don't want to seperate him from his family at all, you just want his help in bonding more closely with them and being more involved when they visit.", "YTA not for not eating the starter but because of how you reacted, I also don't eat guacamole because of the texture but I still nibble on the chips, or you could have ordered another starter for yourself to share with the table that you liked.

You didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, he did. But \u2026 it\u2019s on him for a) forgetting, which is fine, people forget things, and b) not including you on the discussion on what was being chosen for a starter.", "YTA.  Did they actually look at you or did you see an opportunity to make a passive aggressive comment to show how jealous you are of his sister getting his attention instead of you?", "INFO: wait, you sat there and made comments about how badly prepared the avocado-based dish was, despite the fact that you weren't eating it because you hate avocado?", "YTA.  You are the one who doesn\u2019t eat avocado.  Apparently, literally every other person *does*.  \n\nSo why should he *not* order it because *you* don\u2019t like it.  \n\nYou could have just ordered your own, but you chose to sulk.  He\u2019s probably more annoyed that you made a thing about it than he is that you didn\u2019t eat it.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ve never tried it, so you don\u2019t know you don\u2019t like it.  You are acting like a child.", "NTA, but it's not about the guac.  It's about the fact that your boyfriend consistiently prioritizes his mother and sister over you, then punishes you for not being 100% malleable and accommodating.  This will be your life, js....", "NTA. I have a shit memory. Very shit. But even when it comes to acquaintances that I see frequently, if we were out eating and someone ordered something with peppers (that I'm allergic to), I'd say \"Okay, can't have that, so I'll skip this\". I would also remember what other people can't eat because I have shit I can't/won't eat and that means I'm aware it's an issue. Sounds like your boyfriend doesn't have that issue, loves the food in question, and likes to 'conveniently forget' that you can't/won't eat it. I still remember that my ex hates olives and wouldn't even kiss me after I ate one. It's not that hard to remember things about people you purport to love. And it's bothersome to me that he thinks you have to remind him of something you've told him MORE THAN ONCE. Once would be enough for me, but I could honestly see it slipping. But if it was a thing that had been brought up before enough times, he should remember it.\n\nIt feels like he's trying to shift the fact that he either doesn't care to remember onto you, or that he doesn't want to skip avo because he loves it. Fine, he can love avo with his family, but I'm not at all cool with the fact that he's making it a thing like you did something wrong. You didn't. I'd rethink the relationship if he can't manage to remember basic info like that about you.", "Hes turning it into a thing because he was embarrassed\n\n\nHe had the mirror showing his actions thrown into his face\n\n\nIdk i feel like dropping him altogether would be easier in the longrun\n\n\nIf he cant remember you when the women in his family are around what about marriage, honeymoon, kids birth\n\n\nI wouldnt want to deal with that kids of dude when hes supposed to support me instead", "I\u2019m absolutely baffled that either party could manage to get this upset over *chips and guac.*\n\nI was going to suggest they break up bc this is insane, but now I\u2019m wondering if they deserve each other.", "Agree with this!", "Agree but YTA he wanted avocado, so he ordered it.  You wanted something else, OP, order it.  You're not a child.", "Yeah and the whole.  \"He seems to ignore me when with his family\".  Like, if it isn't every weekend, get over it.  He's an ass because this was a non-issue and he should've dropped it but OP is the one who made it awkward which was completely unnecessary.", "I so agree with this.  People don\u2019t participate in starters all the time.  No one cares.  She made it a Thing.", "Maybe she just didn't feel like eating chips. She knew the food she ordered would be coming and she wasn't super hungry. Not eating something ordered for the table isn't rude.", "Why did she need to?", "Personally I don\u2019t eat starters, it quickly ruins my appetite. OP could be the same. No one asked if she would like some before deciding to get it for the whole table, so she shouldn\u2019t be expected to eat it", "Completely agree with you both TA. passive aggressive choices on both sides. \u201cRemember?\u201d \u201cI thought it was something you\u2019d remember\u201d not to mention normal people forget things about their wife or husband of 20 years.

Because OP doesn't like avo doesn't mean nobody else is allowed to order it for themselves.", "That's very aggressive and you have no clue how many times the avocado conversation has happened between them.

Very embarrassing thinking back, but I was only 20.", "right, or just eat some of the chips", "omg stahp saying avo", "He ordered it for the table, he was surprised when she didn't dive in with him and his sister. If he'd ordered it for himself and his sister knowing she wouldn't partake I agree with you, but that's not the case here.", "lol calm down", "> you have no clue how many times the avocado conversation has happened between them.\n\nOP indicated in her post that she has said it many times. She can replace the number 100 with a more accurate number. Talk about nitpicking...", ":)", "No.", ">If he'd ordered it for himself and his sister knowing she wouldn't partake I agree with you, but that's not the case here.\n\nWhy? If he and sister wanted it, not remembering is irrelevant. Seriously. He does not have to ask permission.", "Yes.", "Did we read the same story? They were surprised when she didn't start eating with them. He ordered it FOR THE TABLE, including her. You're right, if he's ordering for himself he doesn't need to ask permission to order something she doesn't like, but I know I'd be embarrassed if I ordered something for my girlfriend to eat that I know she doesn't like and just had a brain fart about. It's very plausible that's why he's acting out. Obviously, none of us know that's the reason, but it's not \"absolute nonsense.\"", ">Did we read the same story?\n\nYes, but I'm not conflating different issues. The BF lacks in the caring department, valid complaint. But in this situation? With all the passive agressive bullshit OP showed? Nope. People in a group are allowed to order and share starters not everyone on the table will want. Is this really in question?\n\n>They were surprised when she didn't start eating with them.\n\nYeah, because he forgot. He is an asshole for that (kinda, a little). He is not an asshole for ordering something he wanted. Even if he forgot.\n\n>He ordered it FOR THE TABLE, including her.\n\nIrrelevant. No one is forced to partake if they don't want to.\n\n>You're right, if he's ordering for himself he doesn't need to ask permission to order something she doesn't like, but I know I'd be embarrassed if I ordered something for my girlfriend to eat that I know she doesn't like and just had a brain fart about.\n\nWell, normal people have a discussion with the whole table to give people the chance to opt in or opt out. Nobody says otherwise. And BF, sister and mum could have been more inclusive. But OP is able to speak, too.\n\n>It's very plausible that's why he's acting out. Obviously, none of us know that's the reason, but it's not \"absolute nonsense.\"\n\nMaybe, but OP admits she came into the meeting with problems with sister and mum (valid or not is not my point, may well be valid). She admits she didn't hear all, and didn't speak up to ask. She admits she claimed to be ok when she wasn't.\n\nIf I were the bf I'd be pissed too, no matter what I forgot or didn't.\n\nThey all suck. But OP sucks the most.\n\nEdit: The \"absolute nonsense\" was directed at your \"inconsiderate order\""]}
