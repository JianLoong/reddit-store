The other day when talking to my wife, she kept interrupting the conversation to ask if I am ok, with a tone I would describe as \"Omg are you ok?!\". This first time I answered \"Yeah, I'm fine I just haven't been sleeping well and I'm tired\". Then she did it again in the same conversation and I brushed it off with \"Yes, I am good\".\n\nLater that evening after she got home from work she again interrupted our conversation with it and I addressed it with \"You keep asking me if I am ok, I have told you that I am tired. Are you ok?\" to try and indicate that I am finding her behavior a bit strange and perhaps a bit annoying but I did this calmly with a smile.\n\nThen, not 5 minutes later she did it again and I snapped a bit and said with some anger that yes I am fine and she has now asked me that 4 times today. I was annoyed and angry at her when I said this, it was an emotional outburst.\n\nShe snapped back at me that she is only trying to care about me and she doesn't deserve to have her head bitten off. I immediately apologized for snapping at her and acknowledged it was an emotional outburst. I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about so I felt jammed between a rock and hard place when constantly put on the spot like that.\n\nShe has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative. I can accept that her motivations were to help but I didn't find her approach to be helpful. I found her tone somewhat belittling and to repeatedly interrupt a normal conversation to point out that, yes I do not look good at moment to be annoying and I got annoyed and immediately apologized.\n\nShe is acting like I am an AH and I don't think that I am and kind of think she is by carrying on about it.

Tell her that you're not ready to talk about it.\n\n> She has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative\n\nShe's hurt that you're _obviously_ lying to her, keeping something from her, and that you then snapped at her because she was able to tell that you're _obviously_ not okay.\n\nI have a very similar dynamic with my girlfriend (although with the genders reversed). I can *easily* tell when my girlfriend is upset or something is bothering her. And she tends to bottle it up and say \"no, I'm fine\", and then I get uncomfortable because _I can SEE she isn't_, so I try to get her to spill the beans so I at least know if it's something I did, or if there's something I can do for her, and then she gets annoyed that I keep asking about it and then she snaps at me and then I feel hurt and get upset. It sucks.\n\nThe trick is communication. Understand that she's asking you because she can SEE something is bothering you and she wants to understand, and help you and support you. That's not manipulative, that's her trying to be there for you. You lying about it is and telling her not to trust her eyes, if anything, a bit gaslighty (although I understand it's not coming from a bad place).\n\nAnd she needs to understand that sometimes, when you're struggling with things, you need to stew on it for a while before you're ready to talk about it. That's just how you are, it's not personal and it's not that you don't trust  her or anything like that.\n\nAnd then, when this situation arises, be as honest with her as you can. Don't lie to her and say you're fine because she can tell it's not true. Don't say that you just didn't sleep well, when it's _obviously_ more than that. Tell her basically what you told us: \"I'm not ready to talk about it, but it's not your fault, I'll be okay, and I'll share with you as soon as I feel able to.\"\nThat's something she can at least relate to.\n\nI'm tempted to say that neither of you are assholes, you're both trying to do your best and you just sucked at communicating. But the bit where you accuse her of being manipulative is a bit assholey. So YTA, I guess?", "NAH but next time instead of saying Yes I'm OK, say: \"not really, but I need some time to process this myself before I can talk about it, so just give me some space ok?\"", "Lol so you're not ok but you keep telling your wife you are ok. And she knows something is off with you.\n\nFuck sake man, just tell her that yes there is something bothering you but you don't want to talk about it now. And apologise for your behaviour", "You're tired and overwhelmed by stuff that you're not willing to tell your wife about (yet). This means that you're behaving differently in conversations with your wife. \n\nShe's picking up on your different behaviour and trying to check in with you about it \n\nBecause you're tired and overwhelmed, you perceive this as belittling.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nYour wife, who no doubt knows you very well and can easily tell the difference between you being tired and you being distracted/worried, cares about you being ok. You're not ok. You're not just tired. And you're not even acknowledging to her that you're working through some stuff.\n\nYTA for blowing up at your wife for well intended concern.", "You\u2019re not okay.  And she sees that.  So stop telling her you are.", "NAH. Have you heard the old saying, \"how are you, and how are you really?\"\n\nThe thing is, we're conditioned in many cultures to say we're fine even when we're not okay. Your wife picked up on that. But, I have to admit it's awfully annoying when people won't let it go.\n\nThere's something not being communicated here and your wife knows it. You might need to take the keep and talk sooner than planned because it's becoming unfair on her", ">I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about\n\nI was 100% on your side until this part.\n\nShe's your wife, she can tell when something's not right.  She knew it was something other than sleep, that's why she kept asking.\n\nYou don't have to tell her now, you don't have to tell her ever.  But she's anxious and probably wondering if it's something she caused, and by you saying you're just tired you're actually lying to her and she knows it and is now wondering why you're lying to her.\n\nIf you want to tell her, but not now, say there is other stuff but you're not ready to talk about it yet and you'll let her know when.\n\nIf you don't want to tell her, say there is some other stuff but you prefer to keep it to yourself.\n\nWhen my boyfriend does this it helps me for him to say if it's something I caused or not.  Maybe that'll help your wife.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for snapping at a repeated question that you felt you sufficiently answered, I don't think she's an asshole for continuing to question you when she can tell you're not telling the whole truth.  But you definitely need to trust that she knows you well enough to know when you're hiding something, and she needs to learn that sometimes you don't want to talk about all your problems all the time.", "NTA I hope whatever you are going through passes. If your wife loves you then she will understand whenever you are ready to talk.", "YTA \nYes she\u2019s being annoying but she cares maybe ask her to stop asking politely.

He's never asked a 4th time because, at that point, either I've told him what's going on, or he's smart enough to read the social clue that I'll talk about it when I'm ready, if I need to talk to *him* about it at all.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou told her multiple times that you were fine.\n\nShe should accept your answer.

This first time I answered \"Yeah, I'm fine I just haven't been sleeping well and I'm tired\".

Are you ok?\" to try and indicate that I am finding her behavior a bit strange and perhaps a bit annoying but I did this calmly with a smile.\n\nThen, not 5 minutes later she did it again and I snapped a bit and said with some anger that yes I am fine and she has now asked me that 4 times today. I was annoyed and angry at her when I said this, it was an emotional outburst.\n\nShe snapped back at me that she is only trying to care about me and she doesn't deserve to have her head bitten off. I immediately apologized for snapping at her and acknowledged it was an emotional outburst. I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about so I felt jammed between a rock and hard place when constantly put on the spot like that.\n\nShe has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative. I can accept that her motivations were to help but I didn't find her approach to be helpful.

Until they choose to speak up I am not at fault or to blame for their mood. If they choose to displace those feelings onto me I calmly say it seems like you are going through a lot right now would you like to talk about it. I've found it makes them more mad when you don't badger them and then they're feeling like idiots at the end of the day.\n\nI will say it has taken 6 years of practice to do this. I would get anxiety so bad and then have to talk myself down because it's not even my issue to get worried about. \n\nNew mantra: if they're mad at me, they'll tell me (then go about your day looking unfazed even though you're riddled with anxiety)", "Spot on username", "\u201cLearn to hide your feelings better\u201d? Uh, no.

That\u2019s something that he has to work on, that\u2019s something me and my girlfriend had to work on to get to that understanding. If he wants to avoid situations like this one, then he needs to learn to communicate better with his wife. \n\nSociety telling him to, and him feeling the need to fix it himself or also things he has to work on himself, not excuses. There isn\u2019t anything he needs to do alone, that\u2019s what marriage means. His wife clearly wants to know the issue, one assumes in order to help. Boxing her out just causes more strain. \n\nYeah his wife could also do with improving her communication skills. But she isn\u2019t a mind reader, she doesn\u2019t know the severity or weight of what OP is going through, cos he won\u2019t tell her. He could feel a bit sick or have crippling gambling debts, she doesn\u2019t know. All she has is a man that looks like there is something wrong not wanting to talk about it, and in my experience, I don\u2019t think it would have mattered how she phrased the question, he would have got annoyed. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m reaching but I think his frustration comes from a feeling of shame about whatever the problem is, and that would result in anger regardless of how gently she asked.", "That's true too, and you're right. But unfortunately, my experience is that most that do this don't want to fix it. They just want to know that it's not about them.", "Except it's not the truth, it's a lie. He admitted that. \n\nSure, maybe also a defense mechanism, to cover up his unwillingness and or inability to communicate clearly and respectful with his wife. \n\nThere was no force involved, until he snapped at her. So he's lying to her, hiding issues, lacking emotional intelligence, and then gaslighting her about it and mad when she makes it clear she can see through his lies. \n\nThat's on on him. Hence, he's TA.", "Because she knows him well enough to know that it's bullshit", "Yep, I know there is something else going on because I read the forth paragraph where OP said \u201cI\u2019m struggling with some things but they are not things I\u2019m ready to talk to her about\u201d.\n\nSeriously, you are hard work!", "I feel like you didn't completely read my comment.\n\nIsn't saying that just a defense mechanism? Both sides could've been worded better. Had he said something was bothering him, do you think she would've left it alone? I personally don't. I think it probably wouldve made it worse. She knew he didn't want to talk about it but on purpose continued to pester about it.\n\nShe's definitely more at fault here than he is.", "One billion percent.", "How much more clear does, \"No, nothing is bothering me. I'm just tired because I haven't been sleeping well.\"?\n\nHow is that not clear? And the answer isn't \"Because the wife knows better than the person she is asking.\" Because at that point the wife may as well tell the husband what is bothering him if she knows him so well.", "I honestly think this is the best approach. You have to step back and say, well if they are upset with me they can tell me, otherwise I\u2019m going to keep going under the assumption that everything is fine.

That's never once ever occurred to me. I mean, I'm not saying that everytime I've been asked this I have expected them to fix it or want to. It's always had like a genuine kindness to it, but.. Just to know that it's not about them and not care at all (I'm assuming). That has to be a different kind of hurt. You have me looking back at memories trying to see if this has ever happened to me.", "And you are basing this off of........ nothing. Nothing in the post indicates this.
