The other day when talking to my wife, she kept interrupting the conversation to ask if I am ok, with a tone I would describe as \"Omg are you ok?!\". This first time I answered \"Yeah, I'm fine I just haven't been sleeping well and I'm tired\". Then she did it again in the same conversation and I brushed it off with \"Yes, I am good\".\n\nLater that evening after she got home from work she again interrupted our conversation with it and I addressed it with \"You keep asking me if I am ok, I have told you that I am tired. Are you ok?\" to try and indicate that I am finding her behavior a bit strange and perhaps a bit annoying but I did this calmly with a smile.\n\nThen, not 5 minutes later she did it again and I snapped a bit and said with some anger that yes I am fine and she has now asked me that 4 times today. I was annoyed and angry at her when I said this, it was an emotional outburst.\n\nShe snapped back at me that she is only trying to care about me and she doesn't deserve to have her head bitten off. I immediately apologized for snapping at her and acknowledged it was an emotional outburst. I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about so I felt jammed between a rock and hard place when constantly put on the spot like that.\n\nShe has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative. I can accept that her motivations were to help but I didn't find her approach to be helpful. I found her tone somewhat belittling and to repeatedly interrupt a normal conversation to point out that, yes I do not look good at moment to be annoying and I got annoyed and immediately apologized.\n\nShe is acting like I am an AH and I don't think that I am and kind of think she is by carrying on about it.

Tell her that you're not ready to talk about it.\n\n> She has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative\n\nShe's hurt that you're _obviously_ lying to her, keeping something from her, and that you then snapped at her because she was able to tell that you're _obviously_ not okay.\n\nI have a very similar dynamic with my girlfriend (although with the genders reversed). I can *easily* tell when my girlfriend is upset or something is bothering her. And she tends to bottle it up and say \"no, I'm fine\", and then I get uncomfortable because _I can SEE she isn't_, so I try to get her to spill the beans so I at least know if it's something I did, or if there's something I can do for her, and then she gets annoyed that I keep asking about it and then she snaps at me and then I feel hurt and get upset. It sucks.\n\nThe trick is communication. Understand that she's asking you because she can SEE something is bothering you and she wants to understand, and help you and support you. That's not manipulative, that's her trying to be there for you. You lying about it is and telling her not to trust her eyes, if anything, a bit gaslighty (although I understand it's not coming from a bad place).\n\nAnd she needs to understand that sometimes, when you're struggling with things, you need to stew on it for a while before you're ready to talk about it. That's just how you are, it's not personal and it's not that you don't trust  her or anything like that.\n\nAnd then, when this situation arises, be as honest with her as you can. Don't lie to her and say you're fine because she can tell it's not true. Don't say that you just didn't sleep well, when it's _obviously_ more than that. Tell her basically what you told us: \"I'm not ready to talk about it, but it's not your fault, I'll be okay, and I'll share with you as soon as I feel able to.\"\nThat's something she can at least relate to.\n\nI'm tempted to say that neither of you are assholes, you're both trying to do your best and you just sucked at communicating. But the bit where you accuse her of being manipulative is a bit assholey. So YTA, I guess?", "NAH but next time instead of saying Yes I'm OK, say: \"not really, but I need some time to process this myself before I can talk about it, so just give me some space ok?\"", "Lol so you're not ok but you keep telling your wife you are ok. And she knows something is off with you.\n\nFuck sake man, just tell her that yes there is something bothering you but you don't want to talk about it now. And apologise for your behaviour", "You're tired and overwhelmed by stuff that you're not willing to tell your wife about (yet). This means that you're behaving differently in conversations with your wife. \n\nShe's picking up on your different behaviour and trying to check in with you about it \n\nBecause you're tired and overwhelmed, you perceive this as belittling.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nYour wife, who no doubt knows you very well and can easily tell the difference between you being tired and you being distracted/worried, cares about you being ok. You're not ok. You're not just tired. And you're not even acknowledging to her that you're working through some stuff.\n\nYTA for blowing up at your wife for well intended concern.", "You\u2019re not okay.  And she sees that.  So stop telling her you are.", "NAH. Have you heard the old saying, \"how are you, and how are you really?\"\n\nThe thing is, we're conditioned in many cultures to say we're fine even when we're not okay. Your wife picked up on that. But, I have to admit it's awfully annoying when people won't let it go.\n\nThere's something not being communicated here and your wife knows it. You might need to take the keep and talk sooner than planned because it's becoming unfair on her", ">I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about\n\nI was 100% on your side until this part.\n\nShe's your wife, she can tell when something's not right.  She knew it was something other than sleep, that's why she kept asking.\n\nYou don't have to tell her now, you don't have to tell her ever.  But she's anxious and probably wondering if it's something she caused, and by you saying you're just tired you're actually lying to her and she knows it and is now wondering why you're lying to her.\n\nIf you want to tell her, but not now, say there is other stuff but you're not ready to talk about it yet and you'll let her know when.\n\nIf you don't want to tell her, say there is some other stuff but you prefer to keep it to yourself.\n\nWhen my boyfriend does this it helps me for him to say if it's something I caused or not.  Maybe that'll help your wife.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for snapping at a repeated question that you felt you sufficiently answered, I don't think she's an asshole for continuing to question you when she can tell you're not telling the whole truth.  But you definitely need to trust that she knows you well enough to know when you're hiding something, and she needs to learn that sometimes you don't want to talk about all your problems all the time.", "NTA I hope whatever you are going through passes. If your wife loves you then she will understand whenever you are ready to talk.", "YTA \nYes she\u2019s being annoying but she cares maybe ask her to stop asking politely.

He's never asked a 4th time because, at that point, either I've told him what's going on, or he's smart enough to read the social clue that I'll talk about it when I'm ready, if I need to talk to *him* about it at all.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou told her multiple times that you were fine.\n\nShe should accept your answer.

This first time I answered \"Yeah, I'm fine I just haven't been sleeping well and I'm tired\". Then she did it again in the same conversation and I brushed it off with \"Yes, I am good\".\n\nLater that evening after she got home from work she again interrupted our conversation with it and I addressed it with \"You keep asking me if I am ok, I have told you that I am tired. Are you ok?\" to try and indicate that I am finding her behavior a bit strange and perhaps a bit annoying but I did this calmly with a smile.\n\nThen, not 5 minutes later she did it again and I snapped a bit and said with some anger that yes I am fine and she has now asked me that 4 times today. I was annoyed and angry at her when I said this, it was an emotional outburst.\n\nShe snapped back at me that she is only trying to care about me and she doesn't deserve to have her head bitten off. I immediately apologized for snapping at her and acknowledged it was an emotional outburst. I am struggling with some things but they are not things I am ready to talk to her about so I felt jammed between a rock and hard place when constantly put on the spot like that.\n\nShe has continued to mope and act like she is victim of this interaction and I am personally finding that all a bit manipulative. I can accept that her motivations were to help but I didn't find her approach to be helpful. I found her tone somewhat belittling and to repeatedly interrupt a normal conversation to point out that, yes I do not look good at moment to be annoying and I got annoyed and immediately apologized.\n\nShe is acting like I am an AH and I don't think that I am and kind of think she is by carrying on about it.

Four times in the span of an entire day is not constant nor crossing a line. I have seen people with people-pleasing and anxiety barrage their partners with the \"are you ok?\" And \"did I do something wrong\" questions to the point it comes up almost at every turn of conversation.

That morphs concern into self-preservation, in that case, because you feel that your partner being cross and not talking about it is a personal affront.\n\nHowever, OP's wife asked him 4 times in what appears to be an 8+ hour period (before and after work).

They both need to change their behaviour.", "the first one, quite clearly.", "Maybe it's Superb Itch?", "Actual healthy communication. \ud83d\udc4d Sounds great!", "As a fellow hot head this is where my mind jumped to. I've had relationships fail bc they didn't respect it when I'd say I need to calm down before talking about this (tho in all fairness the one I'm thinking of I was much younger and still working out what I needed and how to communicate that maturely)", "Exactly! My partner and I are learning to do this. We had an argument recently, I lost my temper, they started texting me explaining their side of things (neither of us were in a good position to talk out loud), and I told them \"I appreciate you telling me what you were thinking/feeling, but I know I'm in 'fighty asshole mode' right now and I'd rather cool off before engaging in this again because I know I'm going to try and pick a fight.\" \n\nI didn't start really learning good emotional regulation and communication skills until I was 20. They're difficult to learn, but help so much.", "It really is exhausting. The one who keeps pressing isn't \"emotionally intelligent\", as the person above asserted.  They're insecure.", "I've had relationships like that too and me wanting to solve my own problem was always seen as silent treatment. I didn't mop, I was just quite, but that wasn't respected. I was their problem to solve and when I didn't let them I was punishing them.", ">need to know as soon as a mood changed\n\nThey are impatient. Yeah that is how I'd describe these people who demand immediate answers all the time. Instead of waiting, they either resort to pushing for an answer repeatedly or jumping to conclusions, both of which are terrible.\n\nThey are menace to not just people who need time to process their feelings (which is most people I guess), but also to people with facial tics, and to people with resting Clint Eastwood face, and to anxious people with anxious smile or anxious frown, and to people with involuntary emotional expression disorder.", "Then why do you keep asking when they\u2019ve said no? Oh right. Mind reading.", "> No one can mind read.\n\nThen one 'are you OK' answered by 'Yes, I'm just tired' would have been all that happened.\n\nShe kept asking because, gasp, she was trying to read his mind.  She was, in effect, telling him he was lying.\n\nWhich he was, in this case, of course, and that's what makes him ultimately TA.  But it is, in fact, exhausting when you honestly tell your partner that you're tired, and they keep badgering you to find out what's 'really going on.'", "That would be a completely different situation than OP described in this post.", "Maybe accept that it means different things for different people? For this wife of this person, clearly she didn't mean \"are you physically in need of immediate assistance?\". Very very clearly, she meant \"is anything bothering you?\", because she saw that something was bothering him. OP, too, confirms that something was bothering him. So he could say \"You're right, something is bothering me, but I got it, don't worry\". Or he can say \"I am fine\", she sees he is not fine, the incongruence between his obvious mood and his words keeps bothering her (as it typically does when someone is trying to keep something from us but denying that), and they could get into a fight about it.\n\nTo you they may be interchangeable, to many other people and CLEARLY to the people involved they are not interchangeable. So, again, why go with \"I'm fine\" when that's ambiguous at best, and a lie by omission at worst, when you can give an equally true, equally short statement which DOESNT invalidate your spouse's perception?", "Where in the story is he treating his wife like shit?", "OP wasn't treating his partner like shit so I have no clue where that came from", "So we\u2019re no longer talking about the post?", "We do try, and after 15 years together, we know each other\u2019s quirks. My mother is an emotionally unstable narcissist so I learned to lash out from her, so now I'm older and wiser, and desperately trying to be the opposite of her in every way, I try and calm myself down before I approach any grievance, big or small, so we can talk about why I'm upset rather than screaming at him for a handful of little things that I bottled up. It helps that early in our relationship when I would blow my top over anything, he was so laid back his usual response to me screaming like a banshee was, \"do you feel better now?\" Or \"are you done?\" Nothing will make you look at your own behaviour and make you feel like a toddler throwing a tantrum than someone calmly responding to your shrieking, instead of turning it into a shouting match, which was what I had experienced my whole life with my parents", "I know that situation well, hubby hates when I'm upset with him, and I wonder sometimes if he would prefer I shout than give me space to cool down sometimes. It's definitely taken a lot of work for us to get to this place, as individuals and as a couple. I would never describe myself as an expert on relationships, what works for us won't always work for someone else, but the key is finding a way to communicate with each other, even if in the moment you are communicating a need not to talk. We went through a bad patch in 2020, between lockdowns and losing family members, my husband shut down, emotionally, communicationally, you name it, and he did it. It took us a while to get past it, but even now, we are still working on it together. So many of the issues I see couples facing on this app come down to communication or a lack thereof. I don't have much wisdom to impart, but this I know, talk to your partner. Another thing we do is allow each other to get things off our chests without reacting, we sit down when the kids are in bed and explain something that has been bugging us and why, and the other person isn't allowed to talk until we are done, then rather than giving an excuse or explanation, we troubleshoot the situation. What can we both do to change the situation to make it better? It works for us \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, they pick up on subtle body language or tonal cues. It's not magic. But telling someone you are fine when they know you are not makes them feel crazy, and puts them in a position where they either believe you and question reality and whether they're capable of perceiving body language like they thought, or puts them in a position where they DO have to magically know the exact perfect thing their partner wants in the moment without their partner asking or communicating at all. \n\nMaking your partner feel crazy or leaving the entire burden of communicating and emotional labor on them to figure out the exact perfect thing to say to you at all times is NOT okay.", "What are you talking about.. he literally said.. YES something is actually bothering him and he doesn\u2019t feel like talking about it right now:. So he was lying and she\u2019s not stupid or inconsiderate so of course it bothered her", "That was badgering. He will tell when he is interested in communicating. Now he just wants to rest and have a good night's sleep so that in the morning he can think with a fresh mind", "Why repeat the same question over and over though?\n\nIf shes seeing him act in ways that are incongruent with what he is saying, the answer isn't to repeatedly ask the same question. I don't think anybody actually reacts well to that.\n\nThe answer is to reassure them that you're there to listen if they ever want to talk about anything, you can tell them that you see that there's something going on but understand that they don't want to talk about it.\n\nIf you think someone isn't okay, and they're repeatedly telling you they are, and you're asking them the same question, you're not actually doing anything to benefit that person. You're just adding an additional stressor on top of whatever they might be stressing about to begin with.", "HE CAN JUST FUCKING TELL HER HES NOT READY TO FUCKING TALK!!!", "Damn, mad respect. \\*applauds\\*", "If I keep trying to start a car with the same key but the ignition won't turn, the reasonable thought process is maybe I have the wrong key, not maybe I need to use it again.\n\nRepeatedly asking the same question and getting the same answer is useless. Doesn't do anyone any good. If she still feels as though something's wrong, she needs to say something like, \" I can tell something's not quite right, but I understand if you don't want to talk about it right now. Please know that I'm here if you need to talk about anything. I love you.\"", "He wasn't being deceptive though?\n\nHe said he was tired but was fine and she kept asking bc she didn't believe his answer.\n\nETA: I reread and saw that he said he was struggling with other things so I see what you mean now.\nIssue with admitting you've things going on but that you're not ready to talk about is that some people will push you anyways so maybe OPs wife is one of those", "That, we can agree on. I'm not saying her strategy is the best, but he started it and he could easily stop her by signaling yes, there is something you are picking up on and no, I don't need to talk about it or need support right now. \n\nShe can't mind read, she knows something is up, so one clear (and true!) statement could end the situation that is bugging both, but no, of course it's much better to be evasive and leave your partner wondering and worrying about you and then snap at them if they continue to worry...", "Most of the posts in this sub tend to disagree.
