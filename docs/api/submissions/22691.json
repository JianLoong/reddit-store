I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible. My sister just had her second baby about 4 weeks ago, and as usual with a new baby, everyone is pretty excited.\n\nEveryone including my moms new boyfriend of almost a year. Let\u2019s call him Gabe. Gabe is pretty cool, and all around fun guy to be around, but to be honest, neither me or my siblings really consider him as like a father figure or someone close. I mean, we\u2019re all pretty much grown up with our own lives. What men our mother sleep with has nothing to do with us. Our real father has been out of our lives since we were all little if that matters. \n\nBut yeah, my sister had her baby and everything was great until I visited her. She told me mom and her new boyfriend had come by and gave her gifts, but that she was super uncomfortable with a man she considers a stranger holding her daughter. I was inclined to agree. Although Gabe was nice and has given her money here and there, he\u2019s not really our \u201cdad\u201d.\n\nThis weighed on my mind the next time I went to visit, and when the conversation steered toward the baby, I ended up telling him it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll be any kind of \u201cgrandpa\u201d to my niece. This was not out of the blue, he had mentioned how he felt there was some tension between us and him, and I simply felt like being honest was the best. This obviously hurt his feelings as he went pretty quiet. My mother was somewhat mad at me for telling him this\u2026saying things such as \u201cWell if you guys bothered to visit more, maybe you would consider him a dad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s a good man, better than your father ever was\u201d etc etc. \n\nApparently he holds no hard feelings but our interactions are definitely more awkward. My mom wants me to apologize to him and also wants my sister to \u201cwelcome\u201d him as a grandpa, since he apparently has no kids of his own at this point is \u201cmissing out on the experience\u201d.\n\nIdk, I feel like we (my sister especially) have every right to feel this way about him. AITA?\n\nEdit: I will also likely feel this way when I have my own kids, so that\u2019s partially why I was being honest now. My sister is aware of the \u201cdrama\u201d (if you can even call it that) but is busy with her baby and toddler so doesn\u2019t really have time to worry about it. She says mom is being weird and uptight though, and that I\u2019ve said nothing wrong. This isn\u2019t to sway anyone\u2019s opinions, just relevant info since people are bringing up my sister.", "created_utc": 1689811911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154bgo6/aita_for_telling_my_moms_new_boyfriend_that_hes/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have been honest with him without being so blunt, so YTA, but I get it.", "First, your sister is TAH for objecting to a visiting friend hold her baby right in front of her. \n\nSecond, YTA for insisting all these family roles be spelled out in quasi legal terms. It's probable this guy has no intention to be your father and this new baby's grandfather. I'm surprised he has even given any money to any of you. \n\nIt sounds like you siblings are using this guy to punish your mother for 1) finding her own social circle, and 2) not being / keeping your father.", "Ya know-I do think YTA\n\nyes, they may be acting presumptuous(the mother is over the line).  But Gabe has been in her life for a year, he has met you guys and clearly is trying to be friendly/develop a relationship.\n\nyou could have been Kind--you chose not to be.\n\nsomething like.  Gabe, Sis and I think you treat Mom really great--And we really like that about you.  But we are adults and It may take a very long time for us to regard you as more than her good \"Friend\".  \n\nAt 4 weeks I can see sis being a bit squeamish about anyone holding her kid(immunity issues etc).  But lots of babies get held by non-family members.  So really you both just seem to WANT to exclude Gabe, to make him feel excluded.\n\nPS I don't have any strangers handing me money here and there.   Gabe--need a child? I'll step up(no grandkids for you but a few grand-felines).", "YTA. Not for the decisions about the baby, but for how poor your communication skills are. It sounds like you were trying to hurt his feelings, so no surprise that he is upset. Any awkward interactions aren't his fault.", "I did not like my stepdad, but he was the only grandpa around for my kids and they choose to call him grandpa. \n\nHe was a good grandpa to them. Attended school events with Mum, participated in family gatherings.\n\nIf he had not been around, my kids would have had very limited contact with any grandfathers.  One blood one lived in the UK, the other NZ for 1/2 the year.\n\nI am not sure why you are so antagonistic towards this man?", "YTA\n\nthe grandpa i\u2019m closest to isn\u2019t even my blood (grandma remarried) and i love him to death and he is my grandpa. maybe give him a chance like your mom said, no one is going to replace your father but maybe your sisters child can have one more person that cares and looks after them, i don\u2019t think that\u2019s so bad after all.\n\nno one is saying that he needs to be considered grandpa right now but maybe in a few years it\u2019ll be the reality of the situation.", "NTA\n\nNo amount of time makes someone a dad.  My step dad has been in my life for 20 years, we talk and enjoy each other\u2019s visits regularly.  He\u2019s even helped me with house remodeling (my mom too, they\u2019re into that).  But he will never be my dad.  I was a teen when they met, that ship sailed.  And likely had I been even younger wouldn\u2019t have mattered as I did not want or need a dad.\n\nYour mom needs to understand ASAP no time, no nothing, will make her bf dad.  Maybe over years the grandkids will see him that way, it\u2019ll be their choice, but zero owed.  It\u2019s really your mom who should be checking in and not bringing him to the hospital, etc.  \n\nYou and your sister need to make that clear to her so she doesn\u2019t set him up for failure.", "Nta. He is with your mom for 1 year, you are adults so you might have seen 4-10 times... That's not enough to have a real bond. I don't understand how he can think of you as his kids... To be something to you and your kids there needs to be a bond forming and not just giving money. It's not because he is with your mom that he gets a father card, it doesn't work this way, he needs to earn it.", "YTA. \n\nThat was not your place to have that discussion. Your sister is old enough to open her own mouth and tell him her feelings. You could have commented on what was relevant for you, not her, and it would have been awkward but fine.", "So I'm pretty much the adult version of that baby. My real grandfather committed suicide over a decade before I was even born and apparently my grandmother moved on pretty quickly in my mum's eyes. \n\nObviously my grandmother's new boyfriend had been in their lives for a long time before I was born but they never interacted much and according to my mother she really didn't like him for a long time.\n\n When I was born, I spent a lot of my early years with my grandmother, we lived in the same building until I was 4 (though her boyfriend had his own home and they often just visited each other). But obviously that also led to me spending time with him. \n\nI never called him my grandfather or anything like that, he was always just his first name and he had his own grandchildren. \n\nBut he definitely was the closest I ever had to a grandfather and at 13, he became my godfather. My mother actually stopped disliking him and my sister and I often went on vacation with him and my grandmother.\n\nHe died in march of this year and my mother and I both attended the funeral and my mother was crying along with everyone else. That close bond didn't happen overnight, it happened over years. What your mother's boyfriend needs is patience and to not push for this grandfather role. Given that your father seems to be out of the picture for good, it might happen anyway when your mother spends time with her grandchild or it might not. NTA", "Well, i understand where you are coming. you might not calling a dad because you dont have that kind of relationship with him. But why to denied a granddad for the new children arriving to the family? The man is a good person, is good for children to have grandparents. They will actually have that kind of relationship, even that you dont allowed them to call him grandad. Let the children grow  will all the love and kindness people around them wants to show them. Thats good for them. You were a lttle bit the A here.", "While it's completely normal for you and your sister as adults to not consider Gabe a father to you, as you are both adults, to your children and your nieces/nephews he will be the only grandpa they know. \n\nHe's a boyfriend now, so okay, but if they get married then he will be grandpa. I was two at my grandma's wedding. I had no idea my \"grandpa\" wasn't my biological grandpa because no one told me because I was there at the wedding. He treated me like a granddaughter. I didn't think too much that my parent called my grandma \"mom\" and my grandpa by his first name... lol\n\nYTA - you don't decide the relationships your children have with others. The more people that love your child the better. It takes a village.", "Gently, YTA\u2026 But listen, I feel like I\u2019ve been in your shoes. Of course, I don\u2019t know the full picture. A bunch of strangers on the internet cannot understand the extent of your family\u2019s relationship. \n\nI\u2019ll just say this: my mom\u2019s current husband will never be my dad and I\u2019ll never call him that. He\u2019s been around for a few years now and we gave him a chance. (Begrudgingly, at first. I admit that.) \nMy son then  came along. He adores him and calls him Dan-Pa. I guess we\u2019re lucky that his first name could be turned into this grandpa/new-guy hybrid, lol. I think you should apologize if you feel like this man is worth it. He may be. \nIt took time for my bitterness to fade. Allow yourself to get there.", "So if someone hands you money as a gift you are obligated to consider them family? Fuck that bullshit.", "If you aren\u2019t ready to believe he will be around you don\u2019t set your kid up for loss.", "I got scolded whenever I called my grandpa's wife grandma. She had been there all my life, my mom just never warmed to her. It was so confusing for me as a child. She is my grandma. And OP doesn't get to decide that for their niece.", "OP states in the post that their bio father has not been in their lives btw", "Just cuz he isn\u2019t given the title grandpa doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be in their lives. Obviously he will if he is with the grandma but he\u2019s been an around for less than a fucking year. Be for real", "I'm sorry, I must be misunderstanding something. Because your post sounds like you think that every single visitor to a home with a new baby is entitled to hold the baby regardless of the parents' comfort with that - is that what you're saying with that first paragraph?", "What are you talking about, \"surprise grandpa\", the baby is 4 weeks old, your mom's bf has known your sister longer than the baby has!", "I get being hesitant about it, but I agree with some other commenters on why not let it go where it goes. I totally get telling him to back off or pump the breaks if he tries to be too close too soon about being a grandpa, but at the same time, what if they stay together for a long time? When your kids or your sister's are 4+ if they're still together who else would be grandpa? And can he not have a grandfatherly role and just not be called grandpa if that's what you want? It just seems like you're resistant to and shutting this whole thing down for no reason with no discussion kind of early. And again no shade about not committing to anything now; he's only been dating your mom for a year which isn't very long. But why the need to shut down any potential relationships growing in the future? He doesn't have to be your dad to be your kid's grandpa or whatever. (And I have a Grandpa who is in every way my grandpa despite being my moms step-dad and someone she doesn't exactly view and her actual Dad). \n\nBasically why not an open conversation about what yall expect/want on both sides? He apparently hasn't pushed to be grandpa, and it's too early for him to be grandpa, but why shut him down 100% when he hasn't done anything and might end up being in your lives for a long time?", "This is not every single visitor. This is a man who has been dating the grandma for a year and has given gifts to the new mother. This is in the new mother's house (or maybe the grandma's house?) So this is not a soccer stadium full of people. It's a small family gathering.", "<<the way that you phrase it in your post is that you needed to make sure he knew his place>>\n\nThis was my take--what OP said could have been said KINDLY.  There was NO kindness in OP.", "Is this how you are going to react everytime someone brings a stranger into the family? Or just the one that is with your mother?", "YTA. If you\u2019re mom and her bf stay together, and you want your hypothetical child to have a relationship with your mom, that child is in all likelihood also going to have a relationship with your mom\u2019s bf."]}
