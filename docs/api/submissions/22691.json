I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible. My sister just had her second baby about 4 weeks ago, and as usual with a new baby, everyone is pretty excited.\n\nEveryone including my moms new boyfriend of almost a year. Let\u2019s call him Gabe. Gabe is pretty cool, and all around fun guy to be around, but to be honest, neither me or my siblings really consider him as like a father figure or someone close. I mean, we\u2019re all pretty much grown up with our own lives. What men our mother sleep with has nothing to do with us. Our real father has been out of our lives since we were all little if that matters. \n\nBut yeah, my sister had her baby and everything was great until I visited her. She told me mom and her new boyfriend had come by and gave her gifts, but that she was super uncomfortable with a man she considers a stranger holding her daughter. I was inclined to agree. Although Gabe was nice and has given her money here and there, he\u2019s not really our \u201cdad\u201d.\n\nThis weighed on my mind the next time I went to visit, and when the conversation steered toward the baby, I ended up telling him it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll be any kind of \u201cgrandpa\u201d to my niece. This was not out of the blue, he had mentioned how he felt there was some tension between us and him, and I simply felt like being honest was the best. This obviously hurt his feelings as he went pretty quiet. My mother was somewhat mad at me for telling him this\u2026saying things such as \u201cWell if you guys bothered to visit more, maybe you would consider him a dad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s a good man, better than your father ever was\u201d etc etc. \n\nApparently he holds no hard feelings but our interactions are definitely more awkward. My mom wants me to apologize to him and also wants my sister to \u201cwelcome\u201d him as a grandpa, since he apparently has no kids of his own at this point is \u201cmissing out on the experience\u201d.\n\nIdk, I feel like we (my sister especially) have every right to feel this way about him. AITA?\n\nEdit: I will also likely feel this way when I have my own kids, so that\u2019s partially why I was being honest now. My sister is aware of the \u201cdrama\u201d (if you can even call it that) but is busy with her baby and toddler so doesn\u2019t really have time to worry about it. She says mom is being weird and uptight though, and that I\u2019ve said nothing wrong. This isn\u2019t to sway anyone\u2019s opinions, just relevant info since people are bringing up my sister.", "created_utc": 1689811911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154bgo6/aita_for_telling_my_moms_new_boyfriend_that_hes/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s not my cousins father and they don\u2019t really have a super close relationship. He has kids - and grandkids - of his own. But he loves this little baby who is in no way biologically related to him as his own.\n\nFamily is more than blood - don\u2019t deprive you sister\u2019s baby or your own future babies of an opportunity to have a caring and loving granddad.", "You may not consider him as a father figure and that's OK. But if the kids grow up around him and he's a good guy, the kids might see him as grandpa. I don't think there was any need to go out your way to tell him what you did.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t really neeeeed to explicitly come out and tell him that. Your sister could\u2019ve said it herself, or asked you to say something if it bothered her. But your mom is being dramatic, although probably just trying to defend her boyfriend. But there\u2019s also no reason to have a man be grandfather to the children of adults he barely knows.", "YTA. I probably would say something different if you described Gabe as one of those crazy partners who forces a relationship on their partner's grandkids, but he sounds nothing like that. \nYou are not the one who decides what kind of relationship your nephews and nieces have with Gabe. As long as Gabe is a good person and he wants that relationship, it should be up to them if they consider him as their granddad. Maybe you grew up with many people who thought they could be your stepdad, but the grandchildren don't know about it. You are not only taking the grandpa experience away from Gabe but also from the kids. The damage is done, meaning if they want to consider him as a grandparent, there will always be some kind of tension. Did you grow up with loving grandparents?", "YTA. Mind your own effing business. Also, if he\u2019s not good enough to be a grandpa, how is he good enough to take money from? You have issues.", "YTA that\u2019s your sisters place to decide and tell him.  You are not her spokesperson.", "You were really quick to make that assumption.  If he is around in a few years and seems like he's gonna stick around for good, I would allow that door to open. Kids need grandparent figures. Personally, my moms' father decided not to be in her life from a young age, and mine. He is alive, but we have never had any kind of contact. It is a hole in my heart that will always be there. Yta", "NTA\n\nIt's just the way it is. My sister in law's boyfriend of a few years has never become my kid 'uncle' and probably never will. Not because he's not a nice guy (he is) or that we don't like him (we do), but simply because he wasn't a part of our lives for all the years my kids grew up.\n\nBut personally I wouldn't have told him, though. Let the grandkid figure it out themselves. If he grows up and want to call him grandpa, I wouldn't have a problem with it at all...", "I'm inclined to say YTA. Very valid that you don't see him as a paternal figure, that makes perfect sense and would be an okay thing to admit. But you spoke on the behalf of your niece. \n\nBoth sets of my Grandparents divorced and remarried before I was born. My bio grandmothers were/are both assholes. The one good grandmother I have is actually my step grandmother, who's married to my paternal grandfather. I'm so grateful that she treated me as her grandchild when she absolutely never had to, considering we're not blood related. She never let that get in the way though.\n\nYou have someone there who is willing to be a grandparent, and now you have likely alienated him. It doesn't matter that you don't see him as a father. That doesn't have to get in the way of him being a grandfather & your sister's - or even maybe your children someday - getting to enjoy that.\n\nAlso none of you should really allow him to give you money, if you're going to treat him like this in return. He sounds like he's trying, so by being closed off yet taking money - that sounds like he's being used. That's likely no ones intention, but it's something to think about.", "Soft YTA. Mostlt because I do not understand why people are so concerned about stuff like this all the time.\n\nSay your mum and Gabe are together now for the rest of days. Your niece/nephew will only see him as a grandparent, regardless of whether you see him in a parental role for yourself. \n\nIf your niece/nephew default to calling him grandpa/granddad or any variation, I would say its more unpleasant telling a child not to do that. Plus they're still a newborn, there's plenty of time before this needs to be a worry and your mum and Gabe will either be together or not.\n\nI say this a child of divorce with parents whk remarried; all my step-grandparents who were in my life from early childhood go by \"Nanny so and so\" no matter how much or little I saw them. It made no difference to anyone involved.", "YTA. You overstepped. It's not your place to speak for your sister. Since you're \"all pretty much grown up with our own lives\", your sister should be capable of handling her own business and having this conversation with Gabe.", "YTA. Should have kept it to yourself.\n\nOn another note, don\u2019t let Gabe hold the baby if your sister is uncomfortable. He is practically a stranger to you and your sister, so it it not weird to be uncomfortable with a stranger holding your (sisters) baby. Sure, he is your mothers love interest, but that\u2019s all (currently. Hopefully you will grow a relationship with him over time).", "YTA, not your kid, why are you telling him that? Besides, I wish I had a grandpa growing up. I didn't, and I feel I missed out. I wish some old cool Gabe would've decided to teach me how to whittle or something like that. Now you are trying to rob kids who are not yours of that experience just because you feel uncomfortable.", "YTA. Did Gabe even say anything about expecting to be seen as a grandfather? It sounds like all he did was hold the baby, which is a pretty normal thing for people to do when they meet a new baby. If your sister had an issue with Gabe holding the baby (which I find a bit ridiculous tbh), then she should have said something at the time.", "NTA. You can feel about him what you wish. \n\nHe has never been a father, was never there as your stepfather, and he\u2019s not married to your mother. I do wonder whether what is going on is some kind of projection by your mother, or immense insecurity from the bloke. \n\nBut I do have a question. Why is he giving out money to your sister? That is weird. If Gabe and your mum had been together for many years, or were married, understandable. But boyfriend for one year? Something is off", "YTA. Your mom is allowed to move on and have new relationships. It's sad that you and your sister are so cold to him just because he's not your real dad. He's not there to be your dad now either. But if he's still around in a couple more years, you bet he's going to develop a grandparent relationship with your and your sister's kids. To them, he will be their grandfather, blood related or not.", "I get that you\u2019re not close enough to think of him that way, but it feels like you could be making more of an effort to get to know him", "This should be the top comment. Why is OP policing this boundary so hard already?", "Right!? Sooo many times the step-family member is checked out, mean, abusive, etc. If you find an additional person who is good to the kids in your life, count yourself lucky. Kids can never have too many positive role models in their life or parental type figures. OP doesn't need to have close relationship, but it's far too soon to know how any of this will go. If Gabe is still around and a solid grandfather figure to this kiddo, why is that such a problem for OP? Why is the potential for that such a negative thing for OP? I think there's a dynamic and trauma not being discussed (not that it needs to be). I hope OP and sister can heal if that's the case.", "I had to go back, and it doesn't *seem* like dude is pushing to even be a grandfather type? He's being a good dude? He's existing?\n\nUnless there is a specific reason why the sister feels off about having this man *holding her baby*, both OP and the sister got some issues with mom and/or Gabe that they need to hash out. Holding a baby won't grant anyone grandfather rights.\n\nI do believe it's up to the sister as the current parent of a grandchild to decide whether Gabe should or should not be an official \"grandpa\" (as in be called grandpa), though if he's a genuinely good person... if he is going to add kindness and affection in this child and any other potential child in this familys lives, why be against it? If he's not going to add good things, sure, keep him at a distance, but otherwise, it almost slips into pettiness for pettiness sake.\n\nMy grandmother had a long term boyfriend when I was growing up, and until she passed. Was he my grandfather? Not really, but he was sweet and kind, and a good man, and I was lucky to have him around. If Gabe is going to leave a child with a similar warm feeling, he deserves a chance at least.", "This is a good answer. He is never going to be a father figure to OP and sister, and it seems like that is what the outburst was about. Being a father is a whole different role than being a grandfather though, the expectations for commitment should be entirely different. They are doing a disservice to the children if they alienate this man, they could benefit from spending time with loving grandparents. Also the mother may start to feel recentful if she feels her partner is not accepted by her children.\n\nYTA", "Agree with this, sure it's early days at the moment but if he's still with grandmother in a few years it's entirely down to the child how he is perceived. Presumably they'll be babysitting occasionally and spending holidays together as a family, chances are he will be a grandfather figure.", "Yeah, I have a step-grandpa. I didn\u2019t know he was a step- until I got older, I just thought of him as my grandfather. \n\nI agree that it seems immature a premature to push this issue now, in this way. If the sister doesn\u2019t want someone she views as a stranger holding her baby, she can address it. She\u2019ll also have ample time to figure out whether she wants them to babysit or be alone without the child; it\u2019s a newborn, she\u2019s not popping out for the weekend anytime soon.", "YTA. You know who gets to be the ultimate authority on whether or not he\u2019s grandpa?  The little girl. And frankly, the more grandparental love she gets, the better.", "Also, it doesn't actually say he ever asked to be called grandpa or anything like that. Just that he was holding the baby. I don't feel like it's unreasonable for your mom's boyfriend of a year to hold your child. And it's weird that OP made the leap from that to him wanting to be in a grandfather role unless there is some info missing here.\n\nHer comments just seem unnecessary and rude.", "Many cultures are different.  Your attitudes come across as perhaps a rural asian culture?  sorry, if I am wrong.  Family dynamics and culture can be complex.", "I don\u2019t understand why people bring money into this. I\u2019ve had plenty of men in my moms life give me money or help out, yet didn\u2019t feel entitled to being my dad. That\u2019s not how it works. I\u2019ve given friends money for their children and didn\u2019t expect a god mom title or feel owed anything. Titles aren\u2019t bought", "Oh yeah because affection is transactional.", "As I read it, Gabe didn't say anything about being a grandpa or seeing himself as one. OP preemptively told him he was never going to have that role once the convo switched to the baby. Gabe didn't even have the chance to insert himself in that way before OP cut him off.", "Agreed. I wasn\u2019t comfortable when my mum was thinking of a grandparent name for her partner and sure now they are married so he\u2019s officially my step dad and my son\u2019s step grandpa but if I had had my way I wouldn\u2019t have given a grandparent name before that point. I also wasn\u2019t an aunt to my husband\u2019s nieces until I was engaged to my husband! \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t have minded my sister saying something to my mum/her partner either. Especially if we felt the same way and if I was busy with my newborn.  \n\nAlso all these people saying his money is good enough to accept but then he should be grandpa- oh so every gift now has to be from a family member? Is a gift from a well meaning family friend now entitled to accept if I don\u2019t tell my children to call them aunt/uncle. I got small gifts from people in my religious community who I know but my kids never will- I\u2019m hardly going to give them a special name just because they gave them a gift. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Just curious, where has he forced a relationship? \n\nBecause if he was going around calling himself their father, pretty sure OP would have written that in. Especially if she's going around accusing him of inserting himself as a grandfather figure", "That's a completely different story...this guy's her mom's bf...not even fiance", "Are you a new adult? Like, 19-20?", "Wrecked your pre-teen lives and now you are in your 20's? Have you considered she has had time to reassess her ideal qualities in a man and has this time chosen someone without these same flaws? He could be around for a long time, so in effect will play the grandfather role regardless. I had no grandparents growing up and it was incredibly lonely - the more the merrier I think.", "Your preteen lives? Your holding a grudge about your preteen lives? \n\nYou're adults. Get it together and go seek help. You're clearly holding on to grudges and are projecting on your mothers boyfriend. I suggest a therapist cause this behavior is juvenile, considering you're an adult.", "Perfectly reasonable.", "So you still want to punish your mum for this? Because it sure seems like it.", "This is a newborn. There's no setup at this point or even in the next year or two. They could be together for 10 years, married, and then get divorced. Relationships end and change due to all sorts of circumstances. You can't predict or save your child from every painful thing in life. Loss happens. Grief happens. I'm not saying they should do the opposite, just balance.", "So wild to me that people don\u2019t see that", "My boss gonna be real surprised when I roll up and call him \u201cDaddy.\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "Yes, he may not be a father figure for OP and the sister, but he's in the baby's life from the beginning and can develop a grandfather relationship with them. If he's a fundamentally good person, why not?", "This a thousand times over", "This was my thought too. She went nuclear asserting a boundary that wasn't being threatened. This is all about mom. Like \"mom's new boyfriend\" when they've been together a year. In a comment OP states mom's last serious bf was when they were kids and he was an asshole who disrupted their lives. And now mom is the one saying 'accept him as grandpa.' Very understandable reluctance to embrace mom's partners as family after that, but everything here looks like OP projecting mom's inappropriate behavior/unreasonable requests onto Gabe so she doesn't have to address the long term issues with her. Which I get. Someone behaves unreasonably and refuses to listen to you long enough you stop considering that as a variable and treat it as a constant, a fact of life. \n\nESH but gabe. Gabe sounds pretty neutral here.", "Actually, it's not really your choice. It will be the kid's choice growing up to see where he will put this man on his family tree", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t really your place, but your mom is delusional if she thinks adults are going to view her boyfriend of a year as a dad, regardless of how often you visit. Even if they marry, he still won\u2019t be dad to you or your sister. \n\nYour mom is mad because she has a fantasy in her head and you\u2019re not cooperating with it. Your niece isn\u2019t a prop for him to experience grand parenthood. However, if Gabe is a nice man and stays in your mom\u2019s life for the long run, he very well be a grandpa type figure to your niece- and that isn\u2019t up to you.", "If something like that had never been said, then no, the conversation wasn't \"heading that direction\" and it's insensitive at best to explicitly bring it up unprompted.\n\nWhy are you focusing on the kids and their \"Mom's Boyfriend\"? None of them will be the ones calling him grandpa, and if they get so offended by the grandchild calling the guy in the grandfather role grandpa that's their own fault. It's just selfish to try and take that away in advance.\n\nAs you say, people feel the way they feel. They become controlling when they try to change how other people feel. Only one person's chosen to do this and it's not Gabe.", "You read again. He said there was tension. But not by his doing since he didn't even know this discussion was on the table. So she was behaving abnormally because she wanted him to know his place and created the opportunity to let him know.", "My grandpa and grandma hadn't married when I was born either. \n\nThis guy could be around for the next thirty years, and the child or hypothetical children will only know a world with him in it", "And about a potential relationship between neice and Gabe, which no one can predict. He may be an incredible grabdpa she grows up with and will see him as. Maybe he'll dip before her first birthday.", "My boyfriend keeps in touch with his ex-wife's kids. They were pretty young when he married their mother and they all got pretty attached. I love that he still cares about them and is involved. They're all adults now. I think it's pretty cool.", "Exactly. My dad remarried after I had moved out, so my stepmom was never a mother figure to me, but she has been an AMAZING grandma to my kids.", "Exactly my thoughts. My family had a similar situation with my grandfather. He came into the picture when my mum was a teenager but my brother and I considered him to be our grandfather regardless of him not being a father figure to our mother (her bio father wasn\u2019t in the picture anyway)", "When we had kids a lot of people gave us money as gifts - we never referred to any of them as grandparents! It would have been very very rude if I gave it back or refused the gifts.", "What are you ok they are all adults and he's moms bf of a yr ffs. So if they break up how long before new bf gets to be grandad?? Your screen name should be changed to Alarmingbraindelay3709", "You are in a sub that\u2019s judges and asks for judgement. He may be an amazing grandparent. If they are still together in 20 years time will u still say the same. I think you are YTA. U don\u2019t have children yet it may be years away before u do. This is yr sisters conversation to have not yrs", "That might hold water if they\u2019d only been dating a few weeks, but it\u2019s nearly a year now and they live together. He\u2019s not a stranger. He\u2019s not trying to be your new dad, either, so stop acting like a spoiled teenager.", "I don\u2019t understand all these YTA comments either. He hasn\u2019t even been in your mum\u2019s life for a year. No way is that long enough to consider him in a family role like grandfather, especially when you and your sister don\u2019t consider him as a \u201cfather\u201d. As for speaking for your sister, she had discussed the situation with you so there is no issue speaking on behalf of her and yourself. You established a boundary with him, which is your right to do. Obviously if he is around for the long haul, you and your sister may change your thinking.", "You talked about him and your niece, not him and your hypothetical child. It takes dishonesty to conclude you were speaking for yourself.", "I think you're an asshole. The way you speak about him seems childish. It's like you're bitter that your mom found love and you're not accepting of it. I couldn't imagine going out of my way to hurt someone as deeply as you did without there being a good enough reason for it. From what you've said the man has been trying, but all you've done is reject. You need to reflect on yourself and how this could damage your relationship with your mother. That's even if you care about her at all."]}
