I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible. My sister just had her second baby about 4 weeks ago, and as usual with a new baby, everyone is pretty excited.\n\nEveryone including my moms new boyfriend of almost a year. Let\u2019s call him Gabe. Gabe is pretty cool, and all around fun guy to be around, but to be honest, neither me or my siblings really consider him as like a father figure or someone close. I mean, we\u2019re all pretty much grown up with our own lives. What men our mother sleep with has nothing to do with us. Our real father has been out of our lives since we were all little if that matters. \n\nBut yeah, my sister had her baby and everything was great until I visited her. She told me mom and her new boyfriend had come by and gave her gifts, but that she was super uncomfortable with a man she considers a stranger holding her daughter. I was inclined to agree. Although Gabe was nice and has given her money here and there, he\u2019s not really our \u201cdad\u201d.\n\nThis weighed on my mind the next time I went to visit, and when the conversation steered toward the baby, I ended up telling him it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll be any kind of \u201cgrandpa\u201d to my niece. This was not out of the blue, he had mentioned how he felt there was some tension between us and him, and I simply felt like being honest was the best. This obviously hurt his feelings as he went pretty quiet. My mother was somewhat mad at me for telling him this\u2026saying things such as \u201cWell if you guys bothered to visit more, maybe you would consider him a dad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s a good man, better than your father ever was\u201d etc etc. \n\nApparently he holds no hard feelings but our interactions are definitely more awkward. My mom wants me to apologize to him and also wants my sister to \u201cwelcome\u201d him as a grandpa, since he apparently has no kids of his own at this point is \u201cmissing out on the experience\u201d.\n\nIdk, I feel like we (my sister especially) have every right to feel this way about him. AITA?\n\nEdit: I will also likely feel this way when I have my own kids, so that\u2019s partially why I was being honest now. My sister is aware of the \u201cdrama\u201d (if you can even call it that) but is busy with her baby and toddler so doesn\u2019t really have time to worry about it. She says mom is being weird and uptight though, and that I\u2019ve said nothing wrong. This isn\u2019t to sway anyone\u2019s opinions, just relevant info since people are bringing up my sister.", "created_utc": 1689811911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154bgo6/aita_for_telling_my_moms_new_boyfriend_that_hes/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grandparent type roles when children are this tiny generally aren't much more than cooing over the little potato and buying gifts. Grandparent relationships develop more when the children get older and I think it's too soon to shut that door so rudely in someone's face, especially when he wasn't beating the door down calling himself Grandpa anyway. \n\nIf he's still around when the kid is 4 and wants to teach them to fish or have a tea party, I'd let him do it.
