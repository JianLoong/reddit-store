I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible. My sister just had her second baby about 4 weeks ago, and as usual with a new baby, everyone is pretty excited.\n\nEveryone including my moms new boyfriend of almost a year. Let\u2019s call him Gabe. Gabe is pretty cool, and all around fun guy to be around, but to be honest, neither me or my siblings really consider him as like a father figure or someone close. I mean, we\u2019re all pretty much grown up with our own lives. What men our mother sleep with has nothing to do with us. Our real father has been out of our lives since we were all little if that matters. \n\nBut yeah, my sister had her baby and everything was great until I visited her. She told me mom and her new boyfriend had come by and gave her gifts, but that she was super uncomfortable with a man she considers a stranger holding her daughter. I was inclined to agree. Although Gabe was nice and has given her money here and there, he\u2019s not really our \u201cdad\u201d.\n\nThis weighed on my mind the next time I went to visit, and when the conversation steered toward the baby, I ended up telling him it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll be any kind of \u201cgrandpa\u201d to my niece. This was not out of the blue, he had mentioned how he felt there was some tension between us and him, and I simply felt like being honest was the best. This obviously hurt his feelings as he went pretty quiet. My mother was somewhat mad at me for telling him this\u2026saying things such as \u201cWell if you guys bothered to visit more, maybe you would consider him a dad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s a good man, better than your father ever was\u201d etc etc. \n\nApparently he holds no hard feelings but our interactions are definitely more awkward. My mom wants me to apologize to him and also wants my sister to \u201cwelcome\u201d him as a grandpa, since he apparently has no kids of his own at this point is \u201cmissing out on the experience\u201d.\n\nIdk, I feel like we (my sister especially) have every right to feel this way about him. AITA?\n\nEdit: I will also likely feel this way when I have my own kids, so that\u2019s partially why I was being honest now. My sister is aware of the \u201cdrama\u201d (if you can even call it that) but is busy with her baby and toddler so doesn\u2019t really have time to worry about it. She says mom is being weird and uptight though, and that I\u2019ve said nothing wrong. This isn\u2019t to sway anyone\u2019s opinions, just relevant info since people are bringing up my sister.", "created_utc": 1689811911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154bgo6/aita_for_telling_my_moms_new_boyfriend_that_hes/", "score": 871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s not my cousins father and they don\u2019t really have a super close relationship. He has kids - and grandkids - of his own. But he loves this little baby who is in no way biologically related to him as his own.\n\nFamily is more than blood - don\u2019t deprive you sister\u2019s baby or your own future babies of an opportunity to have a caring and loving granddad.", "You may not consider him as a father figure and that's OK. But if the kids grow up around him and he's a good guy, the kids might see him as grandpa. I don't think there was any need to go out your way to tell him what you did.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t really neeeeed to explicitly come out and tell him that. Your sister could\u2019ve said it herself, or asked you to say something if it bothered her. But your mom is being dramatic, although probably just trying to defend her boyfriend. But there\u2019s also no reason to have a man be grandfather to the children of adults he barely knows.", "YTA. I probably would say something different if you described Gabe as one of those crazy partners who forces a relationship on their partner's grandkids, but he sounds nothing like that. \nYou are not the one who decides what kind of relationship your nephews and nieces have with Gabe. As long as Gabe is a good person and he wants that relationship, it should be up to them if they consider him as their granddad. Maybe you grew up with many people who thought they could be your stepdad, but the grandchildren don't know about it. You are not only taking the grandpa experience away from Gabe but also from the kids. The damage is done, meaning if they want to consider him as a grandparent, there will always be some kind of tension. Did you grow up with loving grandparents?", "YTA. Mind your own effing business. Also, if he\u2019s not good enough to be a grandpa, how is he good enough to take money from? You have issues.", "YTA that\u2019s your sisters place to decide and tell him.  You are not her spokesperson.", "You were really quick to make that assumption.  If he is around in a few years and seems like he's gonna stick around for good, I would allow that door to open. Kids need grandparent figures. Personally, my moms' father decided not to be in her life from a young age, and mine. He is alive, but we have never had any kind of contact. It is a hole in my heart that will always be there. Yta", "NTA\n\nIt's just the way it is. My sister in law's boyfriend of a few years has never become my kid 'uncle' and probably never will. Not because he's not a nice guy (he is) or that we don't like him (we do), but simply because he wasn't a part of our lives for all the years my kids grew up.\n\nBut personally I wouldn't have told him, though. Let the grandkid figure it out themselves. If he grows up and want to call him grandpa, I wouldn't have a problem with it at all...", "I'm inclined to say YTA. Very valid that you don't see him as a paternal figure, that makes perfect sense and would be an okay thing to admit. But you spoke on the behalf of your niece. \n\nBoth sets of my Grandparents divorced and remarried before I was born. My bio grandmothers were/are both assholes. The one good grandmother I have is actually my step grandmother, who's married to my paternal grandfather. I'm so grateful that she treated me as her grandchild when she absolutely never had to, considering we're not blood related. She never let that get in the way though.\n\nYou have someone there who is willing to be a grandparent, and now you have likely alienated him. It doesn't matter that you don't see him as a father. That doesn't have to get in the way of him being a grandfather & your sister's - or even maybe your children someday - getting to enjoy that.\n\nAlso none of you should really allow him to give you money, if you're going to treat him like this in return. He sounds like he's trying, so by being closed off yet taking money - that sounds like he's being used. That's likely no ones intention, but it's something to think about.", "Soft YTA. Mostlt because I do not understand why people are so concerned about stuff like this all the time.\n\nSay your mum and Gabe are together now for the rest of days. Your niece/nephew will only see him as a grandparent, regardless of whether you see him in a parental role for yourself. \n\nIf your niece/nephew default to calling him grandpa/granddad or any variation, I would say its more unpleasant telling a child not to do that. Plus they're still a newborn, there's plenty of time before this needs to be a worry and your mum and Gabe will either be together or not.\n\nI say this a child of divorce with parents whk remarried; all my step-grandparents who were in my life from early childhood go by \"Nanny so and so\" no matter how much or little I saw them. It made no difference to anyone involved.", "YTA. You overstepped. It's not your place to speak for your sister. Since you're \"all pretty much grown up with our own lives\", your sister should be capable of handling her own business and having this conversation with Gabe.", "YTA. Should have kept it to yourself.\n\nOn another note, don\u2019t let Gabe hold the baby if your sister is uncomfortable. He is practically a stranger to you and your sister, so it it not weird to be uncomfortable with a stranger holding your (sisters) baby. Sure, he is your mothers love interest, but that\u2019s all (currently. Hopefully you will grow a relationship with him over time).", "YTA, not your kid, why are you telling him that? Besides, I wish I had a grandpa growing up. I didn't, and I feel I missed out. I wish some old cool Gabe would've decided to teach me how to whittle or something like that. Now you are trying to rob kids who are not yours of that experience just because you feel uncomfortable.", "YTA. Did Gabe even say anything about expecting to be seen as a grandfather? It sounds like all he did was hold the baby, which is a pretty normal thing for people to do when they meet a new baby. If your sister had an issue with Gabe holding the baby (which I find a bit ridiculous tbh), then she should have said something at the time.", "NTA. You can feel about him what you wish. \n\nHe has never been a father, was never there as your stepfather, and he\u2019s not married to your mother. I do wonder whether what is going on is some kind of projection by your mother, or immense insecurity from the bloke. \n\nBut I do have a question. Why is he giving out money to your sister? That is weird. If Gabe and your mum had been together for many years, or were married, understandable. But boyfriend for one year? Something is off", "YTA. Your mom is allowed to move on and have new relationships. It's sad that you and your sister are so cold to him just because he's not your real dad. He's not there to be your dad now either. But if he's still around in a couple more years, you bet he's going to develop a grandparent relationship with your and your sister's kids. To them, he will be their grandfather, blood related or not.", "I get that you\u2019re not close enough to think of him that way, but it feels like you could be making more of an effort to get to know him", "This should be the top comment. Why is OP policing this boundary so hard already?", "Right!? Sooo many times the step-family member is checked out, mean, abusive, etc. If you find an additional person who is good to the kids in your life, count yourself lucky. Kids can never have too many positive role models in their life or parental type figures. OP doesn't need to have close relationship, but it's far too soon to know how any of this will go. If Gabe is still around and a solid grandfather figure to this kiddo, why is that such a problem for OP? Why is the potential for that such a negative thing for OP? I think there's a dynamic and trauma not being discussed (not that it needs to be). I hope OP and sister can heal if that's the case.", "I had to go back, and it doesn't *seem* like dude is pushing to even be a grandfather type? He's being a good dude? He's existing?\n\nUnless there is a specific reason why the sister feels off about having this man *holding her baby*, both OP and the sister got some issues with mom and/or Gabe that they need to hash out. Holding a baby won't grant anyone grandfather rights.\n\nI do believe it's up to the sister as the current parent of a grandchild to decide whether Gabe should or should not be an official \"grandpa\" (as in be called grandpa), though if he's a genuinely good person... if he is going to add kindness and affection in this child and any other potential child in this familys lives, why be against it? If he's not going to add good things, sure, keep him at a distance, but otherwise, it almost slips into pettiness for pettiness sake.\n\nMy grandmother had a long term boyfriend when I was growing up, and until she passed. Was he my grandfather? Not really, but he was sweet and kind, and a good man, and I was lucky to have him around. If Gabe is going to leave a child with a similar warm feeling, he deserves a chance at least.", "This is a good answer. He is never going to be a father figure to OP and sister, and it seems like that is what the outburst was about. Being a father is a whole different role than being a grandfather though, the expectations for commitment should be entirely different. They are doing a disservice to the children if they alienate this man, they could benefit from spending time with loving grandparents. Also the mother may start to feel recentful if she feels her partner is not accepted by her children.\n\nYTA", "Agree with this, sure it's early days at the moment but if he's still with grandmother in a few years it's entirely down to the child how he is perceived. Presumably they'll be babysitting occasionally and spending holidays together as a family, chances are he will be a grandfather figure.", "Yeah, I have a step-grandpa. I didn\u2019t know he was a step- until I got older, I just thought of him as my grandfather. \n\nI agree that it seems immature and premature to push this issue now, in this way. If the sister doesn\u2019t want someone she views as a stranger holding her baby, she can address it. She\u2019ll also have ample time to figure out whether she wants them to babysit or be alone without the child; it\u2019s a newborn, she\u2019s not popping out for the weekend anytime soon.", "YTA. You know who gets to be the ultimate authority on whether or not he\u2019s grandpa?  The little girl. And frankly, the more grandparental love she gets, the better.", "Also, it doesn't actually say he ever asked to be called grandpa or anything like that. Just that he was holding the baby. I don't feel like it's unreasonable for your mom's boyfriend of a year to hold your child. And it's weird that OP made the leap from that to him wanting to be in a grandfather role unless there is some info missing here.\n\nHer comments just seem unnecessary and rude.", "Many cultures are different.  Your attitudes come across as perhaps a rural asian culture?  sorry, if I am wrong.  Family dynamics and culture can be complex.", "I don\u2019t understand why people bring money into this. I\u2019ve had plenty of men in my moms life give me money or help out, yet didn\u2019t feel entitled to being my dad. That\u2019s not how it works. I\u2019ve given friends money for their children and didn\u2019t expect a god mom title or feel owed anything. Titles aren\u2019t bought", "Oh yeah because affection is transactional.", "As I read it, Gabe didn't say anything about being a grandpa or seeing himself as one. OP preemptively told him he was never going to have that role once the convo switched to the baby. Gabe didn't even have the chance to insert himself in that way before OP cut him off.", "Agreed. I wasn\u2019t comfortable when my mum was thinking of a grandparent name for her partner and sure now they are married so he\u2019s officially my step dad and my son\u2019s step grandpa but if I had had my way I wouldn\u2019t have given a grandparent name before that point. I also wasn\u2019t an aunt to my husband\u2019s nieces until I was engaged to my husband! \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t have minded my sister saying something to my mum/her partner either. Especially if we felt the same way and if I was busy with my newborn.  \n\nAlso all these people saying his money is good enough to accept but then he should be grandpa- oh so every gift now has to be from a family member? Is a gift from a well meaning family friend now entitled to accept if I don\u2019t tell my children to call them aunt/uncle. I got small gifts from people in my religious community who I know but my kids never will- I\u2019m hardly going to give them a special name just because they gave them a gift. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Just curious, where has he forced a relationship? \n\nBecause if he was going around calling himself their father, pretty sure OP would have written that in. Especially if she's going around accusing him of inserting himself as a grandfather figure", "That's a completely different story...this guy's her mom's bf...not even fiance", "Are you a new adult? Like, 19-20?", "Wrecked your pre-teen lives and now you are in your 20's? Have you considered she has had time to reassess her ideal qualities in a man and has this time chosen someone without these same flaws? He could be around for a long time, so in effect will play the grandfather role regardless. I had no grandparents growing up and it was incredibly lonely - the more the merrier I think.", "Your preteen lives? Your holding a grudge about your preteen lives? \n\nYou're adults. Get it together and go seek help. You're clearly holding on to grudges and are projecting on your mothers boyfriend. I suggest a therapist cause this behavior is juvenile, considering you're an adult.", "Perfectly reasonable.", "So you still want to punish your mum for this? Because it sure seems like it.", "This is a newborn. There's no setup at this point or even in the next year or two. They could be together for 10 years, married, and then get divorced. Relationships end and change due to all sorts of circumstances. You can't predict or save your child from every painful thing in life. Loss happens. Grief happens.

Like \"mom's new boyfriend\" when they've been together a year. In a comment OP states mom's last serious bf was when they were kids and he was an asshole who disrupted their lives. And now mom is the one saying 'accept him as grandpa.' Very understandable reluctance to embrace mom's partners as family after that, but everything here looks like OP projecting mom's inappropriate behavior/unreasonable requests onto Gabe so she doesn't have to address the long term issues with her. Which I get. Someone behaves unreasonably and refuses to listen to you long enough you stop considering that as a variable and treat it as a constant, a fact of life. \n\nESH but gabe.

Even if they marry, he still won\u2019t be dad to you or your sister. \n\nYour mom is mad because she has a fantasy in her head and you\u2019re not cooperating with it.

None of them will be the ones calling him grandpa, and if they get so offended by the grandchild calling the guy in the grandfather role grandpa that's their own fault. It's just selfish to try and take that away in advance.\n\nAs you say, people feel the way they feel. They become controlling when they try to change how other people feel. Only one person's chosen to do this and it's not Gabe.", "You read again. He said there was tension. But not by his doing since he didn't even know this discussion was on the table.

Obviously if he is around for the long haul, you and your sister may change your thinking.", "You talked about him and your niece, not him and your hypothetical child. It takes dishonesty to conclude you were speaking for yourself.", "I think you're an asshole. The way you speak about him seems childish. It's like you're bitter that your mom found love and you're not accepting of it. I couldn't imagine going out of my way to hurt someone as deeply as you did without there being a good enough reason for it. From what you've said the man has been trying, but all you've done is reject. You need to reflect on yourself and how this could damage your relationship with your mother. That's even if you care about her at all.", "NTA. He has been a boyfriend for one year to your mom while you were both adults - one with kids already. Which means you've seen him how many times? 5? You're right that it isn't a grandfather relationship, and it was strange for him to show up at the hospital to hold the baby. He is essentially a strange man off the street. There are friends who didn't hold my baby until 6 months old just because holding a newborn is not something you should allow outside your inner circle. I'm frankly really surprised that so many people think bringing a gift and dating your mom is all it takes to be a grandpa. Seems like people have a low opinion of grandpas. I grew up with a great dad and establishing that kind of bond takes years.

So your mom has been dating a guy for a year and thinks you and your sister, who are old enough to be having your own families at this point, should be considering him a father figure. Why? What has he done at this point to be a father figure aside from date your mom?\n\n>My mom wants me to apologize to him and also wants my sister to \u201cwelcome\u201d him as a grandpa, since he apparently has no kids of his own at this point is \u201cmissing out on the experience\u201d\n\nIt's not on your sister to let Gabe have the experience of being a grandparent. Her priority is her child, not her mom's bf. Same with you if you have kids.\n\nSounds like your mom is trying to push an importance and relationship that none of you are there with. If he'd been in the picture 5-10 years and you were all on good terms, celebrated together often and weren't still basically strangers, it would feel like gatekeeping the role.

Just, what, cooed over and held the baby. That's what a lot of people will do, from what I understand. Maybe he hoped for bonding with the baby overtime - but who tf knows, and you still felt the need to go and remind him that he doesn't really belong, in your opinion. It was an asshole move. Also, 'not-my-dad' does not equal stranger. There's actually a lot of space in-between!\n\nNow, for a bit of a story.\n\nMy grandfather has a wife who isn't my grandmother - and she came into the picture when I was about 10, I think (I'm 25 now). I was a bit too old to just start treating her as my grandmother, she was \"aunt Ann\" first, now she's just \"Ann\". My mother also doesn't treat her as her mother, since even after their divorce - which happened even before I was born - both of my grandparents stayed in her life, and mine too. \n\nThat being said, I have much younger siblings, who were born after Ann got together with my grandfather, and even though my mother and her don't have a mother-daughter relationship, she still is a grandmother to them. The kids just have three grandmothers - because to them, as my grandfather's wife, she's always fulfilled the role. It's just... natural to them. They understand they're not actually blood related and stuff - doesn't bother them. And all in all, that's what's important here. \n\nIf he filled the role of a grandparent - then he could be one. You and your sister don't need to have a father-daughter realationship with him for that to happen, and I honestly understand why you don't, but don't just strike him out for that. \n\nYour lack of a relationship doesn't stop the baby from bonding with him, and if he visits alongside with your mother and stuff - it's just the natural progression of things. The kid won't mind, unless your sister or you make it an issue. Otherwise, it's probably gonna be great for them - they'll get a grandpa out of it. If you do make it an issue, however, it might hurt them, or confuse them. \n\nSo, get those sticks out of your asses, maybe, and think about *the child*, and not you own discomfort. It might be a bit weird for both of you, but honestly, get over yourselves. People like to coo over children and to hold them, and to play with them, and sometimes those people fill a grandparent role. And a lot of people don't have a parent-child relationship with their parent's partner, but it doesn't excuse just being an ass towards them.", "I feel badly for him and your mom.\n\nYTA for being so mean openly.\n\nit's fine to have an opinion but you are mean.

And that's okay.\n\nThe difference is, unlike your mum and her bf, my father's wife knows this. She has never tried to be anything other than just a supportive, friendly adult, even going so far as to stop my father from using the term stepmum to describe her.\n\nYou could maybe have been kinder in your rejection, but the expectation that someone you've known for a year - and not even known that well, because you and sis are not the ones he has a relation to - is an overreach. You're not TA for rejecting their expectations, they're TA, not for hoping that stepdad will be granddad, but for expecting it. It's only mild assholishness, though, and only because he's been in your lives for so short a time. \n\nGenerally I'm of the opinion that the more people who will be around to love, protect and support our little ones, the better for their development, so I applaud that my father's wife interacts lovingly with my nephew.\n\n I likewise put effort into being a safe adult support for my partner's young adult son, just like I did for my ex-partner's (at the time) teenaged daughter. Kids of whatever age can never have too many genuine supporters to lean on when needed. My ex's teenager eventually came to call me a cool stepmum and that was one of the greatest moments and greatest honours of my life. I miss that kid (now a young woman) a lot, while I don't at all miss my ex. My current partner's son was already an adult when we met, so I don't expect him to ever call me stepmum. But I am going to be every bit as supportive as I can be, because that's just the right way to go about it in my opinion. Especially when a young person needs an older person to be their sounding board, advisor, guide, listener, whatever is needed at the time.\n\nI would hope for you and your sister and any and all present and future little ones, that your mum's boyfriend can become a stable and healthy presence in your lives.

But a year isn't a long time, & your sister especially has every  reason to trust her instincts around ANY person she doesn't want holding her baby. Politeness & social expectations would dictate that you both swallow your reluctance & just be nice to mums bf, to make everyone else more comfortable. Women are conditioned from a young age to smile & be good hosts & take care of others. That's bullshit. You don't need to swallow your genuine feelings in order to not be seen as disruptive, or difficult.\n\nI understand your mum being salty, she's feeling defensive of her partner, no doubt his feelings are hurt.

That's a good sign. Hopefully everything works out & you can all look back at how far you've come.

My dad was super shitty, but I\u2019m glad he at least didn\u2019t keep me from having an awesome and loving grandfather just because it wasn\u2019t his actual dad.", "YTA because you are depriving the kid of someone who could take that role in SOME capacity and already shutting a door that your niece might want to be open. Nobody said leave the baby with him for a week. But other than that, you guys are just being unreasonable.", "You are projecting a heap of malice towards a man who seems to just want to be part of the family and bloody helpful at that! Maybe you all need to get counseling", "YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts not up to you whatsoever how these children feel about him. They may see him as grandpa because he is the man with grandma. You can try to force your perspective on the children, but in the end your doing no one any favors by being overtly negative. \n\nYour sister is allowed to be uncomfortable with him holding the baby, thats perfectly OK and doesnt make her an AH and no one says you have to refer to him as dad or grandpa. but these children in your family may in fact see him that way and your insistence to him that he won't be seen that way is a TOTAL DICK MOVE. whether you admit it or no - you wanted to hurt him personally. grow the fuck up.", "Nta he\u2019s known you for a year, he didn\u2019t help with your development. In no way is he a father figure. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving out the name grandpa then find another name for him or keep it gabe. It isn\u2019t your responsibility because he didn\u2019t have children.", "YTA. Not your kid and not your decision", "YTA. Being \u2018honest\u2019, with the predictable side effect of hurting him, was completely unnecessary. He obviously wants to be seen as family and seems to be participating and being generous. Nobody thinks he\u2019ll suddenly be your dad but in 10 years from now, he may well be a wonderful grandpa. My mother-in-law\u2019s boyfriend is a wonderful Oupa to my son, being a grandpa is not about blood or marriage, it\u2019s about consistency, a smile and a sparkle in the eye.", "YTA for me.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot decide for the child what to call this man. Such interpersonal relationships grow organically during life, and you cannot anticipate how the relationship will develop. You can't speak for a person who can't even speak yet because it's a baby.\n\nIt sounds like you have something against him in principle and he can't do anything right. I understand from other comments that you had a bad experience with your mother's partners. I get it. But I think it is extremely kind the way your mom's partner is acting. And you sound significantly immature.\n\nImagine if you ever brought a partner home and your family made comments like that about him. That he doesn't really belong, and so on. That's really disgraceful.", "I\u2019d say n t a if there was any sign at all that this guy was trying to be grandpa and I think most people who are saying n t a are projecting because they\u2019re all talking about just because he did xyz doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s entitled to grandpa like okay? Tell me where in the post it says that he\u2019s forcing himself to be grandpa? \n\nIt kinda just sounds like you said it to have a dig at him but you chose a topic where you thought you couldn\u2019t be called out on \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso if your sister didn\u2019t want her baby being held by your mums boyfriend she should have said so. Does she think she has no role in safeguarding her own child? She could have said in the moment or told your mother beforehand or she could have even gotten you to give him a text afterwards considering you\u2019re apparently the mouthpiece.", "Y'all sound lame and unwelcoming. Also very immature of you to say this guy will never be considered a grandpa when this child is not even a year old. \n\nI met my \"grandpa\" at 6 years old. They were nana and pawpaw until they died. So who are you to decide for this child. YTA.", "I'm a bit torn on this one. I understand where you and your sister come from. Gabe only came into your lives when you were adults and living at your own places. So it is very understandable that you don't consider him a father figure in any way. However, with the kids it is different. If the relationship holds up, he will be in their lives from the moment they were born (or at least when they were very small). Because your mom will be the grandma, it would be a kind of natural role for him to be the grandpa, even though your sister (and you in the future) don't feel that way. I don't think you should stand in the way of that if it develops that way. Why would you? If this is a good guy, is good for your mom and the grandkids naturally develop a relationship with him, what's wrong with that? \n\nSo in the end, I do think YTA for bringing it up already and possibly making things difficult, because how will you prevent the kids see him as their grandpa?", "NTA. If this guy has been/ will be in the family for 10 years, things will likely end up closer organically. You can't force your way into a position like that.", "NTA. He\u2019s only your mom\u2019s bf of a year, which isn\u2019t even a long time. Tell her you\u2019ll reconsider the dynamic possibly after a few years and after they\u2019re married. My husband\u2019s \u201cstepdad\u201d (didn\u2019t live with or parent him) is grandpa to our son but he had been with his mom for 15+ years and they were married before our son was born.", "My mother didn\u2019t like her mom\u2019s new boyfriend when she just got me. Nonetheless, the man was and still is a third grandpa to me. \n\nOP, whether or not this man will be a grandpa to your niece or not will be decided by them. Unless your sister purposely plans on never giving the man a chance to spend some time with her kid.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. I don't think he was thinking he would sweep in and be grandpa, but let him be along for the ride. And if it's what you wanted then don't worry about awkwardness. He  doesn't know what to do since you've pretty much called him a stranger, felt weird having him around the baby, but don't mind taking his money. I'm just sure he's having a hard time with this weird give and take you've got going. \n\nI'm a step parent, and if my gfs kids started to take my money but tell me to fuck off when it comes to family things I'd be pretty awkward around them too.", "She\u2019s not wrong at all, however she does need to make sure she doesn\u2019t take any money from him. Or anything else for that matter.", "YTA based on the info here... he didn't ask. He didn't say hey I'm dad now, I'm grandpa now, nothing like that. \n\nHad he overstepped then you might have had a point, but from what you wrote, it looks like you shit on a guy's feelings because you don't feel close to him personally. \n\nMy dad got re-married when I was 30. I never considered or will consider her my mom, but I wouldn't go telling her that unprovoked. And I certainly wouldn't try to block her from being a Grandma to any of my kids.\n\nThis guy is relatively new to you. Fine, you're not close to him. Sounds like if anything your mom is the one trying to force more than what's there and she's the one who it needed to be said to privately.", "Definitely second this\u2026 the \u201cbeing honest\u201d was unnecessary and now has caused tension in not only your relationship with him you your relationship with your mothers as well. She will remember this and attempt to prob how he is \u201cso much better than your real dad\u201d so here is a warning to heed. So soft YTA here too it was unnecessary and put a lot of people in very uncomfortable situation to be remembered because you wanted to be honest and speak very freely", "Also just because you don't view him as dad doesn't mean a child won't view him as grandpa. \n\nMy kids see and call my stepmother grandma. She didn't meet my dad until I was 23 and out of the house so she's not really mum to me (she fine. We're friendly but she's not mum)  but she loves my kids and I'm not gonna dictate that she can't fill that role.", "For me it's a case of no one is asking them to call him dad, and the term grandpa isn't some holy symbol of a word, as a kid we all called eachothers grandparents grandma and grandpa anyway, I don't think I could keep old people straight in my mind until I hit double digits", "You can't just buy your way into being a family member lol", "NTA the guy has been with your mum for a year and you guys don't even live with him, he's not related to you, your mum is being weird.", "They have known this man for ONE YEAR bruh I would not trust someone I know for only one year with my child (and yes the exact same goes for a women I've only known for one year it's not because he's a man, it's because he's only been kind of part of the family for a year) I don't see any entitlement to his money either, OP just said that he has given her money a few times to me that sounds like he gave some gifts or something, not like he financially supported them. With the information provided NTA", "If the boyfriend marries mom, then I have a different opinion but for now he hasn\u2019t earned the right to be a grandfather. We had a similar situation but my mil was married to the guy. We adults never considered him as a step-dad but for my kids, he was the only grandfather they knew. Both their bio dads had died years before their birth. The step-grandfather turned out to be an  awful person, unfortunately. He is now deceased, thankfully.", "Yeah people are being so weird and personal about this hes been there a year and people are acting like that means he'll be there the kids whole life", "From the OP:\n\n>Our real father has been out of our lives since we were all little if that matters.", "I have no idea why you're being downvoted. A step parent can definitely be a surrogate grandpa for your kids even if you personally have not bonded that well. The kids don't know any better. Hell, I was 25 or 26 when I met my bf's grandparents and they sort of adopted me as an adult grandchild. I even call them grandma and grandpa, because that's the role they play in my life. Also, as a kid, the woman that babysat us was my surrogate grandma and when we lost her to cancer I cried harder than over the loss of my bio grandmas, because we bonded so deeply with her as kids. Damnit I am even tearing up typing this because I miss her so much. \n\n\n\nEveryone always screaming about how it takes a village to raise a child, but now the village gets handed to them on a silver platter and they go like \"no thanks only blood related pls\". If OP can trust the judgement of their own mother than Gabe could be a very loveable grandfather who could help out with child care in case of an emergency. He didn't raise his own kids and as he says he seems delighted to experience a baby growing up in his surroundings. After a year with OP's it's not even a fling anymore, they seem pretty serious.", "Exactly. The kid will be a few years old before it starts speaking more than jibbersish. By then OP doesn't need to consider Gabe a dad, but the kid could very well see him as grandpa and call him that.", "Eh, given her attitude in this thread the smartest move for Gabe in this situation is to stop trying. \"I'll be in the garage when the kids come by, they've let me know what the deal is.\"", "It's like a weird.... instinct to fully assimilate or they \"lose\".", "I understand you dont feel like he is a father figure to you. But what are you gonna do with your kids then? If he is there to stay, present when your mom is and naturally develops a grandpa like relationship with your kids? Will you tell them they can't? And how will you explain? I would say, let things go how they go and let the kids have a grandpa if he is a good one", "Because OP has not yet emotionally matured enough to understand how to not make other people\u2019s feelings into their feelings, or let other people have conflicts or concerns without jumping into the middle, making it all about them, and flailing around getting their messy, enmeshed emotions on everyone.\n\nOP, if you read this - a normal reaction to that situation is to make sympathetic noises to your sister, assure her you would feel the same, and then *ask her what she is going to do*. She was venting, not enlisting you as her champion. You should have asked how and if SHE planned to speak to him about it, offer to be there as moral support if she wanted you, and then gone home and watched some tv and on the emotional level just playing forgotten about it.\n\nIt is not your baby. It is not about you. It is about how mom feels toward this guy. It is for her to talk about with him and negotiate a solution they\u2019re comfortable with. You and your sister are not a policy making body where her precedent defines how you have to relate to him. You do not need to take on and act out her emotions or conflicts. When you mature, you learn to go the fuck home, have a snack, and leave other people to deal with their own conflicts unless you are *genuinely and materially involved*.\n\nThis is the absolute definition of creating pointless drama for one\u2019s own gratification.", "So your punishing him for her previous boyfriends issues?", "So you're holding a grudge about some dude that your mom dated atleast 7 years ago.", "You sound hugely self centred! This isn't about you, at all. The kid is going to grow up, maybe with that guy around. You had no reason to hit him with that! He didn't do the things that made you insecure! Things develop organically. If he sticks around, he may be a grandad figure to the kid. If he doesn't, he doesn't.   \n\n\nYou were confrontational because you wanted to lash out at your mother. Not him. It's pretty obvious.", "But no-one saying he should be \u201cnew dad\u201d. OP and her sister are grown up, they are highly unlikely to regard him as a father figure. That has absolutely nothing to do with whether niece regards him as a granddad as she grows up. Which if he\u2019s still around she may well do.", "The conversation wasn\u2019t heading in that direction at all? No matter how much OP wants to think it was, there\u2019s nothing to suggest it was. Unless of course you can find it for me?", "My abusive father that I have NC with still sends money to my bank sometimes. I never askedfor it and if he asked me if I wanted it, I'd say no. But he just sends it so why would I send it back? That doesn't mean he is entitled to being in my life again. I hate his guts.

It really is the thought that counts and at least a gift card to somewhere I use is more thoughtful. Money is the second worst gift and I would in no way be equating that to family. Family should be personal. Bring her a cheap necklace with her new baby\u2019s initial if you want to be family", "From your post it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s holding money over your head. Honestly as an adult i do prefer cash gifts sometimes because of bills. I definitely think there should have been a kinder discussion", "My bad, read that wrong, but with that added info, that would mean these adult kids have made it without a father this far. They aren't looking for one now. To have someone you've only known a year, to claim that position is even more presumptuous.", "Gabe did mention that they seem uncomfortable in his presence , op s mother is pushing them to accept him as a father figure at least ( as adults and only after 1!!year of dating)  and Gabe is trying to ' buy ' their love with gifts/ get closer to them.\n\nI think it's ok to make things clear - especially since the sister doesn't mind and thinks the same - so Habe has a correct idea of what to expect instead of him being led by op s mother fantasies.\n\nNTA op", "That doesn\u2019t mean OP us to accept them in any way besides moms boyfriend.

They\u2019ve only been together a year and OP is an adult.", "Oh flip off, he literally traumatized us and was a complete weirdo. He ended up arrested twice while my mom was dating him and probably should\u2019ve been on a list.

OPs story says it was, you have zero base to argue that. You simply were not there", "Wow! I forget that there are people and families out there, where everything anybody ever says or does is micro-examined in the ... hope? of finding something to be offended by. I do not assume (or read) that such is the case, here. It looks to me that he was looking pretty eager to do 'the grandpa thing,' and was being given the warning not to get TOO excited about that just yet. Sure he's hurt, I don't think it was vindictive. Some people are bad at expressing themselves.", "Exactly, way too many people think you can buy your place in a family of buy people's love. That's not how it works", "That doesn't magically become Grandpa. They already treat him as someone with a level of importance in their lives and they seem to like him. That doesn't automatically mean grandpa. Temper your expectations.", "New Tiktok trend lmao\n\n\"Pay me harder, daddy!\"", "This exactly. ESH except Gabe. My mom remarried and I\u2019ve been living in another country for years. Doesn\u2019t mean I refuse to have my stepdad interact with my kids on the assumption that he\u2019s some kind of predator. Having fewer people who earnestly want to care about your kids is a benefit how?! OP, I honestly think your reaction says a lot more about some sort of spite against your mother than anything about Gabe. Your mother is being ridiculous making assumptions too, thus the judgement.", "Completely agree.\n\nIf he and the mother are still together in 10 years I would assume he would be called grandad by any children.

You wouldn't even give this child a chance to eventually bond with this man. Yeah it will be weird the first times but in the end the kid decides wether it will call him grandpa or not.", "So you\u2019re punishing current bf for something that was completely out of his control?\n\nThat unfair and your mother was right when she said that you\u2019d know him if you actually interacted with him. \n\nI understand your hesitancy, I do. However you need to address your trust issues, perhaps through therapy.", "Yeah and shaming people for not sending such money back is just icky. Especially if this stepdad was tryna be nice with this money gift, imagine how rude it'd have been for OP to decline it? That would've definitely upset mommy.
