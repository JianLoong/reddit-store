There's usually about 5 of us. Last week, my friend \"Alice\", showed up with her new boyfriend, \"Bob\" who she has been dating for three weeks. We normally do not allow partners here unless they have been together for a long amount of time, but Alice showed up with Bob without giving any notice or even asking. We were playing Monopoly, and Alice suggested we play a different game, by saying \"Master doesn't like Monopoly.\". Bob then attempted to discreetly whisper \"Good girl.\" to Alice - we are women in our thirties. Another person at game night, \"Chloe\", pointed out that everyone could hear that, and Alice got a bit mad, and said \"Don't disrespect Master.\".\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I said \"Alice, you need to leave now. This whole 'master and slave' dynamic you have going on is extremely inappropriate for games night and I do not consent to partaking in it - it's creeping everyone out.\" Alice started apologising, not to me or anyone else, but to Bob, saying something along the lines of \"I'm sorry for being a bad girl, Master.\". Since then, Alice has been texting me about how I was 'kink-shaming' her, and I have not yet responded. Chloe has also had Alice blowing up her phone to the point where she actually blocked her number.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am starting to worry though that I was a bit too extreme, though.", "created_utc": 1700886510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183bha3/aita_for_kicking_a_friend_out_of_games_night_when/", "score": 259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. No you did not. \n\nNo one even wants to tangentially brush up against the *idea* of their friends\u2019 kinks, much less have their faces rubbed in them.\n\nAlice and Bob were absurdly out of line, and asking them to leave was appropriate and, frankly, restrained.", "NTA - Consent is key and you nor the rest of the group were allowed to give your express consent for this behavior. I am all for kink in the right setting.  However, regardless of the  D/s dynamic and apparent relationship, you were not afforded the opportunity to lay your own ground rules.  \n\nThe couple was clearly the Major AH.", "... NTA and I feel pretty confident that they did this intentionally so they'd have fodder for play afterwards, where he punished her for being a bad girl and getting them kicked out or whatever. Consider blocking her number too", "NTA!!\n\nI'm not into \"the lifestyle\", but I have friends who are, and according to them, you are 100% in the right. They didn't get your consent to play out their scene in your home. They can be into whatever they want, but they don't get to include you without your consent.", "NTA. It was on your friend to at least get permission to bring her boyfriend. She should have also discussed their dynamic with the group if they would be acting in those roles at game night.\n\nThe fact that she referred to it as kink shaming implies it's a kink, and not a lifestyle. Therefore she was involving everyone at game night in her kink without consent. That's inappropriate and something she should understand.", "NTA and you hit the nail on the head. If people are going to be involved in someone else's kink, they have to CONSENT to it ahead of time. And for master/slave types of dynamics, there need to be ground rules that the group would also have to consent to. They can take their inappropriate relationship dynamic elsewhere.\n\nAnd even if they weren't doing that, it was rude of Alice to bring her new bf without asking you all or even letting you know. You could have kicked her out for that alone.", "NTA You hosted a game night for friends not a BDSM game night. If your friend and her new boyfriend want to play games and role play at the same time, they need to find a group of like minded people.", "NTA.

You did not consent to this behaviour, therefore it is inappropriate.\nThat being said are you sure your friend isn\u2019t in an abusive relationship?\nHer behaviour, even for roleplay scenarios is\u2026startling.\nJust maybe check in and make sure she\u2019s ok", "NTA, there is a time and place to indulge in kinky role play and game night with your friends is not one of them. Especially if you didn't even bother trying to ask if any of your friends were cool with you and your boyfriend doing foreplay while you all watched.", "NTA. You were perfectly reasonable - they're welcome to do what they want on their own but they don't get to turn you into non-consenting witnesses.", "NTA. She was out of line.", "NTA, nope I'm not pretending to be okay with that shit in front of me either", "Nta", "NTA like at all. If they want that dynamic fine but nothing about how they went about that was the proper way.", "NTA. You said exactly the right thing. They were brandishing a sexual kink right out there in the open for everyone and they not only didn't ask for him to be there, but they didn't even check that anyone was okay with it. Then, when called out on it, she had no regard for you. Only her 'master'. That's incredibly inappropriate. And his lack of remorse or being at all apologetic about it shows what kind of 'master' he is. A bad one. Alice is currently floating in the dark side, and I think the only thing you can do is distance yourself from her, but maybe let her know that you're there for her when she needs help getting out of that situation. But until she can pull herself free of it, you're not willing to be around two people that trample over consent of others so brazenly.", "Nta. I fully support the lifestyle don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026but wouldn\u2019t it make sense to give someone a heads up that you\u2019re coming over and plan to be participating in (insert your kink here)?", "Eeww eeww, gross. NTA. And she is actually kink shaming you and your friends for not liking what she likes.", "NTA. Games and role play between consenting adults are fine. You are not one of those consenting adults though.

Kink acceptance does not mean kink participation.", "Your sex life should be yours and personal and private. If you choose to be open, that's your choice, however others might not like it being in their face, that's their choice. Its the same with religion.

And if they decline to be included in your religion or religious discussion, that is their choice, and most people respect that. NTA", "NTA. WTF is wrong with her, it's nowhere near kink shaming if they started to drag other unwilling people into their kink(self-centered pricks).\n\nHonestly, it's best to just block her off, she showed zero respect to the group, dragging others into her kink and even getting mad/defensive about it when called out.", "NTA\nShe did not have permission to bring her boyfriend. She was trying to take over game night to make him happy. She was making the actually invited people uncomfortable. You just asked her to leave her kink outside of game night.

You didn't give your informed consent and she didn't respect that. I'm a sex educator and frequent kink/bdsm spaces often and one of the main tenants of (ethical) practice is boundaries / consent.", "NTA - You\u2019re not kink-shaming at all, you\u2019re simply stating that this was not the time nor place for that kink and you were setting your own boundaries.

Like you just don't do that...I'd keep her number blocked tbh. \n\nIf she hasn't shown interest in this before, could it be this guy pushing her to behave this way in the name of seeking his approval?

Their pov gets twisted as to what's really okay or not. \n\nIf that could be the case, maybe keep the door open should she come to her senses, but that's \"if\".

An environment where no one else consents to the situation, acting in such a manner is not only inappropriate and disrespectful but can be seen as harassment of those not consenting.\n\nDo not let that crazy person and her.....person back into your friends circle or near your life.

Calling someone 'Master/Daddy/Mistress' is letting everyone in hearing range know exactly what kind of kinks you're into. And what part you play. That's along the lines of casually throwing out that you were doing anal the other day or that you prefer doggystyle. Unless someone asks or consents to be involved in that information, it's gross, oversharing, and it definitely crosses consent lines. Anyone actually living the BDSM lifestyle in a healthy way knows better than to rub that in people's noses. It's like walking into your friend's house with your 'slave' on a leash and collar. \"What? It's not hurting anyone.\" For one, you don't know that since you don't know everyone's trauma, so yeah, you could be hurting someone unintentionally.
