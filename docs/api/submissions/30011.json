I've told her I couldn't look after her 3 kids along with my own 2 children. \n\nMy sister has always been in and out of prison but this time she will be facing a longer sentence then usual. I've told her when she was 1st arrested that I'd look after her kids, as they were much younger and easier to look after, since I lived quite close to the prison so she could see then weekly whilst she was there. But the second time she was in prison I told her, I couldn't since I had moved to a different part of the country and it would be a lot harder for me to look after them, due to their school being about 3 hours away from my house. She was fine with this, and had her children living with their dad.\n\nHowever, recently she has had a massive argument with her children's father and he's not willing to look after her kids, since the last time they were there they basically trashed the whole house and cause a lot of damages to his house. Which she refused to pay. Along with this her children didn't follow any of the house rules whilst at their father house, and didn't act nicely to their father's other children.\n\nI told her this, and she said that it wasn't her fault that her kids don't behave, and if I took them in perhaps they could learn and try be more respectful. I told her no and that's also not the issue, my elder daughter (F16) didn't like being around my sister son either, due to him and his friend being creepy around her. And I don't want to put my daughter through another incident like that with her son. After this she ended up telling me if I don't them in, they will just end up in forster care and I will be my fault if her kids end up not being successful at anything.\n\nSo I told her looking after her kids along with mine own would not only be difficult since I would have to have them all change schools to one's near my house, but also financially be difficult since she would not be offering any financial support and neither would their father be. She then told me she would pay me after her sentence, which could be reduced with good behaviour.\n\nAlthough, I know financially it wouldn't really affect my family, I still think that adding another 3 children to my family's dynamic would make it harder for me to support my own children, not just her's.\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nTheir grandparents would have been an option however my sister and I parents died a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure their grandparents on the father's side live abroad. The reason why we aren't contacting social services is the fact that they are older, meaning they won't be treated equally, also due to both of us being put in care homes when we were younger. Their father on the other hand doesn't have full custody of the children anymore she does.\nI know many of you are telling me I'm not the AH, but I feel like one due to the fact I am able to look after her with much difficulty.", "created_utc": 1698708450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k6xz7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_look_after_my_sisters/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said no and she needs to accept that. She needs to look elsewhere for child care. 15 years is a long time. even parole with good behaviour she is still going to serve 7 to 10 years.\n\nSadly Foster care may actually be the right option here.", "NTA\n\n> However, recently she has had a massive argument with her children's father and he's not willing to look after her kids, since the last time they were there they basically trashed the whole house and cause a lot of damages to his house.\n\nWell, what a lovely opportunity for him to start raising them better.", "First, nothing is your fault. She chose to do whatever is putting her in prison. Second, the father, like it or not, is the one who is responsible if she's out of the picture, and he's the one who's supposed to parent them when they act up. They are his children, not just her children. NTA", "Their father needs to step up and be a parent. He was never watching her children for her; he was watching his children.  He is responsible even if she has primary custody. If he is unwilling to parent his children, CPS  will open a case against him for neglect or abandonment.  And they will investigate his parenting of all his children.  Yes, the kids are in meed - they need their father to step up. You're NTA for not covering for him on it.", "NTA! Not your kids, not your responsibility . And it is absolutely her along with the kids dad\u2019s fault that they don\u2019t behave. I feel bad for the kids though. She\u2019s projecting her own issues onto you by saying it will be your fault if they end up not being successful. HUH? She is literally going to jail for the umpteenth time.", "Nta but your sister has some nerve saying it would be YOUR fault if her kids aren't successful!  She's asking too much.", "NTA\n\nIf they end up in foster care, it will be because of their father (and incarcerated mother), not you.\n\nYou must protect your children and their well-being first and foremost, tough as that may sound to others.", "NTA- you have to focus on your kids & households wellbeing first, just the simple fact that your sisters son makes your daughter uncomfortable, that\u2019s a no to them staying with you. plus it\u2019s not your fault any of this happened, does it suck? yes. do you need to care for these kids? no.", "NTA, and there is no way for you to make this work. She is responsible for the fact that her kid\u2019s don\u2019t behave; they\u2019re HER kids, she raised them. It was kind of you to take them in when you could, but you\u2019re not in a position to do that now. You have obligations to your own kids, and your sister is asking too much. \n\nAlso, remind her that it\u2019s not *your* fault if her kids end up in foster care\u2014it\u2019s hers. You\u2019re not the one who landed a 15-year sentence. She can\u2019t blame you for the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA. Your daughter was made to feel uncomfortable. Huge red flag. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a bad situation of your sisters making.  Third time in prison.  Monster children.  You cannot endanger your children to attempt to rescue hers from what she has done.  Protect your kids is Job 1 and 2.", "NTA. They have another parent to take them in. You should focus on your family and what makes sense for you!", "NTA\n\n\u201clooking after\u201d her children implies short term babysitting\u2026.  not being their sole guardian for 15 years.", "NTA- it's not your responsibility. I would not put anyone above my child's comfort in their own home. It's not looking after, it's raising them. It sucks that they may go to foster care, but that's not on you. It's on the father and mother.", "NTA. Your children\u2019s well-being has to come first. Your daughter should never be put in that position again. Your sister and her children are dealing with the consequences of their behavior. Your sister earned a long jail sentence. Her children\u2019s behavior was so poor with their father that he is refusing to take them. It is not their fault that they haven\u2019t had the guidance of a stable adult. As a stable adult you cannot consider putting their needs about your daughter\u2019s wellbeing. What about the grandparents? Can they take the children?", "If her kids end up not being successful at anything, regardless of foster care, it will be their, her and their father's fault.  You don't owe her/them anything, including explanations.  Do NOT listen to it.  Hang up the phone, close the door, turn and walk away, whatever it takes.", "NTA\n\nShe is responsible for her children and any negative consequences from her (latest) arrest. Not you.", "NTA\n\nEspecially since these kids are ill-behaved and one of them makes your daughter feel unsafe. You have a duty to protect your own children.", "NTA Sister needs to consider splitting up the kids.  No one who isn't trained in neglected child care will be willing to take on three.", "NTA. The bottom line is that they can't behave and will be destructive in your home, like they were in their own father's, and likely harass (or abuse!) your daughter. YOUR children come first.  \nIf they were respectful, it would be another matter. But they aren't--almost surely due to your sister.  \nNo, your children come first!! This situation is out of your control and not something you can fix without destroying your own family. Don't go there!", "NTA.  Once she goes to prison, if there's no one to look after the kids, they go to foster care.  Their father has to tell social services/CPS that he doesn't want the kids.", "NTA\n\nWhile keeping them together is always in everyone best interest, if they go into foster care, the system won't keep them together.  \n\nSince you said your nephew (M16) was creepy toward your daughter, maybe he needs to go to his dad's home, but you can take the girls?  The F6 may be able to be rescued if she is in a good home.  If the F13 gets along with your daughters well, maybe she can stay with you as well. \n\nAlso, DO let social services help. Kinship foster is eligible for SNAP, free lunches, and Medicaid in most cases.", "Nta, that's a really difficult position for you to be in. I do have a few suggestions.\n\n1) The dad should be having them he is their father.\n2) Is 16m creepy, or is his friend creepy, and he lets him (still not okay but if the friend is 3 hours away, would that be a possibility. Would your daughter be safe)\n3) Your daughter has to be safe. Not ideal, but would you consider taking 13f and 6f? Maybe the dad would  take 16m. It's technically only a couple of years. 13f and 6f might adjust easier (therapy would be a must). Or does he have a friend he could stay with? Or perhaps get emancipated?\n4) I don't know how it works, but social services will be involved whether she likes it or not. The state has a duty to ensure her children are cared for while she is incarcerated.\n5) Last resort, they will go in care, and they will get split up. 15m will end up in group homes or juvie) 13f may get placed, but if she behaves badly, it will likely end up in group homes. 6f will get placed in homes, but she's gonna be alone and not understand why. If they go\nInto care look for other ways you can stay in touch and make sure they are okay.\n\nSome other points -\n\nif you take the kids you need legal guardianship in place (specifically because that means that when the mom gets out she can't automatically take the youngest, she would have to request by applying through the courts (asmi understand it)f). Also, just for general stuff, too, like medical and legal stuff, travel, etc\n\nYou should also apply for child support. The dad should be paying anyway! mom can, too.\n\nIf you do it through social services, then you might receive foster carer payments (depends on the area), and the kids might get other assistance like with college costs etc, therapy, and medical insurance.", "NTA. You had me at \"I told her no and that's also not the issue, my elder daughter (F16) didn't like being around my sister son either, due to him and his friend being creepy around her. And I don't want to put my daughter through another incident like that with her son.\" It is very sad that your sister has put herchildren in this situation, but it doesn't follow that you should let your children's lives turn into a mess they also do not deserve.", "INFO\n\nThis is not \"looking after.\" This is a question of who is going to take primary custody. And regardless of what you want, you need to consider if you're willing to see the kids go into foster care if they father is unable or unwilling to care for them. SO I don't see that this is an AITA question - this is a question about these kids' future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
