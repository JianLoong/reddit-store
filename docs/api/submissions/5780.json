Both of his siblings owe his parents upward of $500k, we owed them $2k because they helped us out with our bills when he went back to school to get his ticket. They held that over us, and would constantly involve themselves in our financial decisions, and disapprove of how we spent our money. \n\nHe got his ticket, and got an amazing job, and the next time they stuck their noses in our business we asked them how much we owed them. We wrote them a cheque, and told them to stay out of our business, they had such a hard time doing that. \n\nIsn't it funny when they try to backpedal excuses, when they get called out?", "You may think you were being very clever, but people like that never change. They're going to do it again, and now you're going to be the daughter-in-law that they complain about. So get ready!", "Not even remotely.  Definitely NTA", "NTA.  They want to dictate his life, but they don't want to admit WHY.   You took way the fake reason, the money.  Now they are floundering.", "Perfect response! In my opinion - even if they did pay, they have no right to question life choices. We paid for both of our children's education. We have never offered an opinion, unless asked. We also helped one child whose house was destroyed in a natural disaster. Same philosophy.\n\nNTA Good luck.", "NTA you have done the wonderful job of taking their position of power away from them.", "Firstly it's none of his family's business how you dealt with it. \n\nSecondly they are at least being honest that it's not about money. It's about control and they are using money to exert control. Sounds like you squashed it. \n\nIt's a parent's job to support their children in my view. They did their job and now they want to but in. NTA.", "NTA.    Well done for standing up for your husband. Your in laws sound manipulative and controlling, setting boundaries will cause friction and reaction but it is absolutely the right thing to do.", "NTA \n\nYour in-laws are mad for a few reasons\n\nA) the parents because you have an excellent way to fully shut down their manipulative BS\nB) the siblings are jealous \n\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but AH aren't going to admit that.", "NTA the rest are pissed that they can't do the same.", "NTA agree with most other comments just wanna say you and your husband sound awesome and it was nice reading how you handled this together", "NTA .. this was a great \u201cput up shut up moment\u201d As in you (OP) are putting up so they (in laws) will shut up. I thought it was a great tactic. They had no choice. The rest of the family can get over it but watch out now, because they\u2019re going to start to come to you for money.", "OP=NTA\n\nYou asked them to stop, to respect that your decisions were your decisions.  \n\nThey FAFO.  OP boss move(that you jointly with your husband--good support on both sides).\n\nAnd the siblings shouldn't be complaining--if you HAD paid the parents back, that would be more money for them to mooch off your in-laws.", "NTA.  \n\nThose parents are trying to manipulate, using finances from the past as a way to control their kids now.  It's **manipulation to create a huge sense of Obligation** in their offspring.   The three biggest manipulations are the ones in **FOG:  Fear, Obligation, and Guilt.**  These parents are combining all three, to keep their kids attached and to keep themselves in as much control as they can get.  \n\n**You two were brilliant.**  \n\nYou didn't do wrong, you called out their bad behaviors for what they were:  manipulative and controlling.  **You offered them what they seemed to be saying they wanted:  payback.   And they admitted it's not about the money.**  They didn't admit that what it's really about is them being in control, them getting to say whatever they want to their grown kids, them getting to be in charge, etc.  This isn't about their concern, as they want to have you believe.  it's about their power.  And **you two just took their power over you away from them.** \n\nIt's probable that the parents have been busily manipulating the other siblings to be their \"flying monkeys\", to try to make you two feel guilty and maybe even to force you to apologize, when it wasn't the two of you that did wrong, but them with their money talk. \n\nI've got grown kids.  I've helped them out with finances in various ways.  What we never do is discuss it again, ever.   It doesn't get brought up when they make decisions for themselves, whether I like their decisions or not.  It doesn't get brought up to the other kids.  The only place I mention that I've even helped them is here, where it's anonymous, to show that it's possible for parents of grown kids to have respect for their adult offspring.  Good Grief.  \n\nYour ILs are a piece of work.  The other siblings are wrong.  **It's perfectly okay for you two to set boundaries and to tell the ILs that you aren't going to accept their bad behavior again in front of you.**   Work out together what to do the next time they try this, because they probably will do it again.  Manipulators do not give up easily, and they tend to push your boundaries during times you are vulnerable, so watch for that, too.\n\nr/justnofamily, r/raisedbynarcissists, r/MILfromHell", "I don\u2019t speak to my mother anymore, but if I did I\u2019m sure she\u2019d still bring up her paying $700 for me to go on a band trip in 2001 when I was 15. I offered to pay her back just to shut her up as an adult and she pulled the same crap. NTA and I\u2019d suggest LC/NC if they don\u2019t get their shit together", "NTA, but you sound like a bada$$!\n\nLove it!", "Agree. And OP, the only reason your BILs/SILs were getting upset with you is because they\u2019re jealous that you and your husband are not dependent on other people for finances. Don\u2019t pay them any attention.", "Parents should do things out of love not leverage.", "This! Nothing in the post actually says anything about them asking for or needing money. Just questioning his life choices & they think he should go back to school. I feel like there\u2019s a page missing here... \n\nMaybe they paid a shit ton of money for husband to go to get a degree & now he runs an illegal bar in his basement. Who knows?", "I think you missed the point of pulling out the checkbook. The in laws wouldn't mind their own business because it was never about the money to begin with... it was completely about control. They'd been asked before to not comment on the issue and refused to drop it. If they didn't want to be called out on their behavior in front of the rest of the family, maybe they shouldn't have been talking about OPs finances in front of the family. NTA OP", "It never was about the money. It was about control.", "Then it shouldnt be a Problem to write a chek for half of it for me :)", "i mean they did not go into debt, so it is more like a reasonable amount of money, which is what parents are supposed to do so there is nothing to really hold over his head, but the money being offered just seems like..... okay but why whad does that accomplish here", "Yeah but it should have been her husband and in private with his parents, not her.", "You are absolutely correct.  The in-laws were the ones who constantly brought it up.   They got called out at their own game and had to back down.  The parents were upset because now they know that their kids know their parents concern about their life choices was only about control.  Hopefully the parents won\u2019t voice their opinions until asked.", "Bingo!", "\"Control\" is the exact term for what the ILs are doing. Take away their leverage (repaying them for the college costs) and you take away their sense of purpose. Sad, really when you think about it. Parents should be happy when their children thrive, even if the parents don't agree with all of the children's decisions. It's called \"letting go\" and some people are not capable of doing it.", "Nailed it. They were trying to hold the money over his head. Very clever retort, OP! NTA.", "GOOD TRY!", "They shouldn't bring it up in public. They had every right to do that in front of others when they started it that way.", "She and her husband came up with the plan together. If it works for them, it works. And his parents picked the venue.", "Then he should have privately written them a check if the true intent was an offering to pay them back for helping him. Otherwise, why would money be involved at all since it doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Just ask them to mind their own business or leave. Nothing in the post states anything about them wanting to be repaid. They have opinions about his \u201clife choices\u201d ... can\u2019t pay someone off to not have opinions.\n\nCan you imagine anyone in your family whipping out their check book to pay you to shut up? In what scenario does that make any sense?"]}
