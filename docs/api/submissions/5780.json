I've helped them out with finances in various ways.  What we never do is discuss it again, ever.   It doesn't get brought up when they make decisions for themselves, whether I like their decisions or not.  It doesn't get brought up to the other kids.  The only place I mention that I've even helped them is here, where it's anonymous, to show that it's possible for parents of grown kids to have respect for their adult offspring.  Good Grief.  \n\nYour ILs are a piece of work.  The other siblings are wrong.  **It's perfectly okay for you two to set boundaries and to tell the ILs that you aren't going to accept their bad behavior again in front of you.**   Work out together what to do the next time they try this, because they probably will do it again.
