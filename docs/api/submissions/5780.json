I've helped them out with finances in various ways.  What we never do is discuss it again, ever.   It doesn't get brought up when they make decisions for themselves, whether I like their decisions or not.  It doesn't get brought up to the other kids.

She was absolutely correct, and they have lorded money over all the rest of their family, but had no power over us.", "If the parent are still paying it, I would pay it off; however, pulling a checkbook out to end and argument is condescending. \n\nEducation is a gift. Gifts should have strings (or I need to go harp on my son) \n\nAlso mistakes are for growing. \n\nAs a parent, I want my son to finish education.

You guys handled it like adults and they handled it like micromanagers.", "Kind of disgusted by this. ESH but especially what you did\n\nYes, his parents are being really annoying, but you whipping out your checkbook like that is just  incredibly arrogant, disrespectful, and degrading.\n\nThe fact that you guys feel \u201csatisfied with how it turned out\u201d is just really cringey for me.", "Yeah sounds like OP and her spouse might wanna skip holidays at in-laws for the next couple years", "Smell your finger that end the curiosity , you have had it in the wrong hole all morning.", "May the Gods of crackology cause you to heal up and hair over.", "That thing will never heal up if you keep sticking your finger in it.", "What stinks is your finger, you keep putting it in the wrong hole.", "You have your finger in the wrong hole again.", "you certainly fail to understand the basics of it all. get your finger out of the hole and smell of it.", "As long as it's not for three fiddy.

She finished undergrad and is now working full-time; there is a solid amount left - enough for a graduate degree if she wants it, or a decent down payment for a house if she doesn't. I'm holding that money in trust for her until she decides what to do with it - because I think it's my responsibility as a parent to launch my kid to the best of my ability, but the choice of direction is hers. Based on the available evidence, that approach has worked just fine.", "She asked for opinions. I gave mine. I don\u2019t even know what the f you are going on about. And I stand by my opinion that after being asked to quit giving them constant unsolicited opinions/advice, the parents want them to do what they feel is the best thing.

If it wasn't about the money, they wouldn't have ever mentioned it whenever they question his life choices. My dad \"loaned\" me money to help me pay during my second year of grad school. I remember when I had to ask him to help because I had to do full time unpaid internship and the money I saved from the last 3 years of working full time wasn't enough anymore to continue paying on my own... My dad said, \"you are my daughter. Of course, I will help you if you need my help.\"\n\nOnce I got a full time job, I asked if I could pay him back and he said no, just save it. When my husband and I got married, I asked again and he said no, save it for down payment for future home. When we sold my husband's condo and offered again, he said no, save it for renovations etc. \n\nMy dad isn't wealthy. He's a blue collared worker. He's working almost everyday. But, he's also a business man and makes good money. He's obviously not hurting for money and I'm pretty sure he makes a lot more than me still (public school employee). My dad has never once tried to control me by saying he loaned me money. \n\nAnyways, you two are NTA. The parents definitely are and relish in having that loan looming over your husband's head in order to maintain that control. If possible, distance yourselves from them.", "NTA. You basically called their bluff, they make out its about money, it's early nit, that's the only weapon they have left when it comes to trying to maintain control over their  now adult chdren", "NTA\nI think you handled it reasonably well. Some people will just not listen and need it spelled out for them in capital letters.", "NTA. You were more than willing to remedy the burden of his education off their plate and in doing so showed everyone what their true motives are. How they think he makes bad decisions considering you two haven't blown your inheritance, is beyond me. But that his siblings continually borrow money off their parents, so of course they got defensive, is an example of why it's so important to call people out on their shenanigans.", "Yta. I get it it\u2019s exhausting., but at the end of the day parents worry about their kids, and they put in their opinions and the kids say uh-huh and keep it moving    if they\u2019re not demanding the money back, or trying to make you feel bad, because no attempt was made, you caused the problem.   And if things are so bad that you guys can\u2019t take some concerned from people who love you then go no contact.  All you did was humiliate them.", "NTA yesss make them eat their words.. I hope they were embarrassed!!! I cant STAND ppl like this. Theyre probably even more pissed because you can actually write then a check that will shut them up!

They do sound annoying lol", "NTA", "NTA - you were trying to set boundaries and having a very hard time doing so with them.  \nNow you've set them.  Let any discouraging family members know that this was up to both of you as adults to set limits with them.     \nThem going on treating you as children was not okay.  \nYou don't \"Buy\" being able to interfere in your adult kids lives with your money.

Good for you for drawing boundaries.", "NTA....people who need to be given boundaries are the only ones ever upset by them.

That is what a controlling person is. \n\n> Sad, really when you think about it. Parents should be happy when their children thrive, even if the parents don't agree with all of the children's decisions.
