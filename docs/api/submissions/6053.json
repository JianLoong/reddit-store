Turns out they don\u2019t accept my insurance and I had to pay out of pocket. I was \u20ac50 short and called everyone I could but no one was picking up. I then called my oldest brother (Dave) because he always picks up and asked him to send me \u20ac50 and I would send it back once I get paid in a few days. He told me not to be ridiculous and he didn\u2019t need me to pay him back \u20ac50. \n\nSara called me that night and asked how I was doing. After the chit chat, she asked if I could ask someone else the next time I need money because my brother is a married man. I was shocked but i apologised and said I offered to pay him back. She said it\u2019s fine but next time, I should plan my finances in advance so I won\u2019t have to rely on a married man. \n\nIt\u2019s my birthday soon and Dave called to ask what I wanted. I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking. My other brother called to ask what I want and I said I wanted some money to heat my apartment. I couldn\u2019t afford to heat it this month. He was baffled that I was so broke I couldn\u2019t afford heating and I wasn\u2019t saying anything. He started tearing up on the phone call with me and ended the call, and sent me \u20ac500 later. I guess he told Dave about the call with me because Dave called me and started interrogating me on why I just told him I didn\u2019t need anything, and then asked my youngest brother. He sounded offended and asked why I feel like I can\u2019t rely on him. I asked \u201chaven\u2019t you spoken to Sara about this?\u201d. He was confused on what I meant and I told him about the conversation I had with Sara after he sent me the \u20ac50 for the hospital. He said he\u2019d call me back but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nA cousin of mine sent me a message a few hours ago saying I was a bitch for meddling in their marriage, and that Dave didn\u2019t owe me anything. I was like ???? When did I say Dave owed me anything? I have never relied on him for anything, nor do I plan on it. I mean I feel bad that Dave and Sara are fighting it I can\u2019t help but feel weirded out that Sara did that behind his back and he had no clue.

At a minimum you can benefit from the years of experience they\u2019ve had. \n\nYou\u2019re letting yourself be consumed by guilt and not using the people around you that want to help you.

Just because you are younger doesn\u2019t mean you are a burden. You need to seek some therapy and stop seeing yourself that way. \n\nBut talk to your brothers. Sit down on a zoom call with the three of them and be honest. Talk about what your life has been like, why you\u2019ve lied to them and what you felt.

I understand strong feelings of guilt and not wanting to worry the people you love with what\u2019s been going on with you but your brothers clearly love you so much and having them know what you\u2019ve been going through would at the very least probably lighten some of the burden you feel keeping up the lies. \n\nMight I suggest maybe writing everything out in a letter/message and sending it to each of them? It would give you more control on what you say and how you say it, and give you some kind of buffer in the actual delivery so that you don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where you\u2019re face to face with them, and lie again or break down crying and can\u2019t tell them everything properly.", "However heartbreaking it is to see your brothers hurt for you, remember that it's *for you* and not because of you. The more you suffer in silence, the bigger their hurt when they eventually and inevitably find out. It actually seems like the cat is out of the bag now and they'll be asking questions. You asking for heat money isn't something they'll just shrug off.\n\nIf that makes it easier, you don't have to have some big coming clean with everything spilling out. You'll have to muster up the courage to admit a few things, but just saying that you wanted to make it on your own and it simply didn't turn out well should be close to enough. They'd probably even respect that.", "My mum and I aren\u2019t close at all. I haven\u2019t spoken to her much since I moved away. She got remarried and started a new family when my dad died and her new family have been her priority. \n\nI know realistically my brothers could pay for everything happily. They offered to do so when I was applying for universities. But I genuinely thought I could provide for myself without burdening them. Hence why I lied, I thought the truth would never come to light because it wouldn\u2019t need to. I had older friends when I was in high school and they were paying for everything with the money they earned and I thought I could do it too. I was naive and it\u2019s much harder and more emotionally taxing than I thought. I also admit I\u2019m a bit too prideful to ask anyone for help, financial or otherwise. Telling them the truth now will require me telling them a long chain of lies I told since I graduated high school. That won\u2019t be easy. But I\u2019ll try build the courage to do it. I\u2019m starting a new job in Feb that pays \u20ac500 more than my current job and I think that will be enough to get me by so I\u2019m hoping I won\u2019t need their help, but I\u2019ll tell them everything soon hopefully.", "You shouldn't be worried.

And I'd go nuclear and cut contact with Sara completely.", "NTA I find it weird that Sara was using the married man thing as a reason.", "NTA. Sara is, though. My brother is my first phone call if I need anything. His wife is also very supportive of our relationship. Sara doesn\u2019t get him to herself when he has other family and the insinuation that you were after your own brother by repeatedly stating \u201che is a married man\u201d is gross. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA - be honest with your brothers. If you have trouble writing or talking to them, you can send them this post. Maybe this can open up a conversation with them. Good luck. Hugs", " NTA. Your brother was happy to help out and knows his finances well enough to be know what he can afford. But just for my own curiosity, how much would that be in American currency?", "NTA that is messed up. Unless if you are leaving big parts out of the story, like you have a drug addiction and you have a history of repeatedly asking for money from him. I actually really dislike my sister in law and would personally be willing to send her money if she really needed it for something like a hospital bill. I would be more likely to send her money than my husband would. Husband and I have separate finances, he could give his sister as much money as he wants.", "NTA. Your further conversation with Sara implied she did not want to give you any more money. Her comment was quite aggressive, he's not a stranger, he's your brother. It sounds like your brother has had words with her over it and she's trying to play the victim to others. Do not feel bad for any arguments your brother and Sara are having, because they're likely to be about her behavior towards you.", "NTA. Jeez, I thought I'd met some profoundly insecure people until I read about this sister-in-law. Do not trust her, EVER. Go out of your way to avoid her until she sees the error of her ways. Maybe even after that.", "NTA. Sara is the problem, not you.", "First off, ignore cousin. Cousin is the one meddling and she needs to stay in her lane. This is between you and your brothers, and between your brother and his wife. None of cousin's business. Feel free to reply: \"What's between me and brothers is between me and brothers. Please don't meddle in our sibling relationship.\"\n\nSecond, you did everything you could have done to not get caught in the middle between your brother and his wife. You *didn't* go running to your brother when Sara first got ridiculous. You *tried* to respect her wishes even though it was very much not in your own best interest. What were you supposed to do, never ask anyone in your family for help ever again because Dave might find out but he's a \"married man\"?!?!\n\nThird, it is clear from the actions of both of your brothers that they do not want you to struggle if they can help you. You are their little sister! They want you to be ok. Dave is making it clear that he wants you to ask him for help, and that's up to Dave, not Sara. Other people don't get to dictate the relationship between you and each of your brothers. Dave has been your brother a lot longer than he has been Sara's husband.\n\nFourth, Sara is full of it. She's making up rules and then insisting you follow them. You are allowed to ask married men for help. You are allowed to ask your married father, uncles, brothers, sons, friends and neighbors for help. You are also allowed to ask married women for help! It's just asking for help! \n\nFifth, Dave is not angry at you. He was frustrated and confused at first because saying this:\n\n>I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking\n\nWhen you could not afford to heat your apartment was kinda a lie. And when you told other brother the truth, that got back to Dave and he was confused. Maybe frustrated. Didn't know why you didn't tell him sooner. What were you supposed to do? So you simply told Dave the truth. He was angry at Sara when he learned the truth because... he should be. She was awful and she tried to come between her husband and his sister.\n\nYou've been more than fine through all of this. The only thing you could have done differently is when Sara first started making her WEIRD requests you could have pushed back. It doesn't sound like that's your personality, but it would have been OK to have said, \"Yes, I know Dave is now married but he is still my brother and in our family, we turn to each other for help in times of need. Getting married will never change that. If Dave can't help me, he will be the one to let me know.\" I get that you didn't think to say that. Sara was being manipulative (and WEIRD). But you're ok.\n\nTalk to Dave again when you can. Tell him you will go back to asking him for help when in need like you did before. Maybe tell him you don't want to interact with Sara anymore if he's not present. He will understand.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sara ITA. She is manipulative and controlling. And the bit about him being a married man \u2014 what on earth is that supposed to mean?\n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s lying about you behind your back, but that isn\u2019t something you can control. I say this from experience with difficult family members and in-laws. She will say what she says and those who really know you won\u2019t believe her. And this random cousin\u2019s misinformed opinion doesn\u2019t matter.", "NTA. But please contact your cousin again. She needs to hear your version of what happened bc It\u2019s so weird that she\u2019s coming at you so strong. Do you think Sara may have twisted this into something way worse and made you the devil in this situation? Bc like why the f is she even contacting your cousin about this situation at all. I\u2019d be more embarrassed that I did this behind my husband\u2019s back and want this to be kept under wraps. Send her the link to this post. Bc Sara is giving off manipulative vibes!", "NTA. Your brothers wife is sick and your he is probably realizing he married a monster. I hope you recover from this knowing you did absolutely nothing wrong here.", "\"I should plan my finances in advance so I won\u2019t have to rely on a married man.\"\n\nThe fuck?? You got sick..thats out of your control and so many people are struggling right now...tell your brother to run. NTA", "NTA. Sara should have taken it up with Dave, not you, or at least told Dave about her (very weird IMO) opinions when she relayed them to you.", "NTA, sara and your cousin definitely sound like they might be however. Sara is upset your brother cares for his family (jealousy maybe?) and your cousin obviously hasn\u2019t heard the entire story and is upset because your brother doesn\u2019t owe you anything but you didn\u2019t even ask which is what resulting in your telling Dave about the conversation you thought he knew about", "NTA. Looks like Sara already had this financial conversation with Dave. He must have said he would support OP regardless of her view. Then she went behind his back directly to OP to get her way. But that\u2019s just my opinion. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA but it is interesting that Sarah would 1, go behind her husband's back in the 1st place. 2, when called out her first response was to badmouth you to all the family. Seems like a fox is in the hen house.", "Rely on a married man? He\u2019s your brother! She\u2019s got major insecurities and I\u2019m glad you told your brother. Make it clear your loyalties lie with him and not her next time if she tries this crap. And same with your cousin. Why is your cousin so upset about this situation to begin with? \n\nNTA!", "NTA!  Sara is calling you TA because it's easier for Sara to blame you than to admit her role in this.\n\nShe had a problem with her Dave giving $50 to his sister in a medical emergency! Instead of talking to him about it, she scolded you and demanded that you change your relationship dynamic with your brother. She also expected you to keep it from Dave so she doesn't look like a bad guy. Nope. \n\nGoing forward, be straight up honest: \"Sara doesn't want me receiving anything from you now that you're married to her.\" If Dave has a problem with that then his problem is with Sara and not you. Never let Sara be a go-between you and Dave, since she's proven herself to be deceitful. Ignore the cousin. That's just a flying monkey.\n\nBut do tell your other brothers about your finances. They clearly care deeply about you, and as weird as this sounds, it's actually an act of love to let them in on your struggles rather than keep it from them.", "NTA- Sara acted hateful and didn't expect Dave to ever find out. She created the conflict in their marriage by going behind his back and that not your fault.", "NTA. Sara's a c***.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t know what him being married has to do with it? Siblings can\u2019t help each other once they\u2019re married? Don\u2019t understand SIL\u2019s logic. It\u2019s not like you were asking to borrow thousands out of the blue, just \u20ac50 which you offered to pay back and he declined. SIL sounds like a huge manipulator and SHE\u2019s the one that has caused a rift in her marriage not you.", "> I was shocked but i apologised and said I offered to pay him back.\n\nYTA. You should never apologise.", "Sounds like your SIL is an American b****", "I hope you're okay. Take care of yourself. Your brothers sound awesome.", "I'm just curious how Sara expected OP to plan their finances for a medical emergency? Edit: seeing as by definition you can't plan an emergency\n\nNTA", "Or Sara realized OP hadn't told Dave what had happened and realized she was left to her own twisted devices, and told a lie about the events that transpired.", " I say immediate family I meant nuclear family as in him, wife and any kids they might have.", "The cousin\u2019s hypocrisy here, \u201chow dare you meddle!!!\u201d Said while meddling in someone else\u2019s business.", "Also something wrong with the cousin, who meddled in OP\u2019s relationship w/ her brother & SIL, just to scold HER for meddling in someone else\u2019s relationship. Sounds like the whole family could use some pointers on Boundaries!", "the mentality (\"hes married he shouldnt help his sibling\") is weird enough. but having that convo with the sibling and not THE HUSBAND is wild.   \n\n\n(OP is NTA)", "She tracked him down over 50 friggin dollars!", "That's hella weird! What does being married have to do with lending your sister \u00a350? I'd understand if it were a large sum that may impact their finances, but come on. Sara is the asshole through and through.", "I read it in the context of \"he has to put his wife ahead of his sister now\" rather than that way but she still needs to do that aboveboard and have her husband aware of it", "That's what I was wondering! I mean, having an emergency fund is a good idea, but this is a teenager studying abroad! She may not even be *allowed* to get a job, so how TF is she supposed to save up a bunch of money just in case she gets sick? And how would she even decide how much is \"enough\"? Is she supposed to look up the going rates for an appendectomy, car accident with major injuries, broken arm...?", "I presume Sara thinks a 19yr old student halfway across the world should somehow have an \"emergency fund\"(which is supposed to be 3-6 months worth of expenses). s/", "RIGHT LOL", "Don't stereotype only children.  I am one and I'm a giving person. I was raised to consider others.  Sara is just narcissistic, insecure and selfish AF.", "One does wonder why the Cousin feels so invested in Sara & Bro's marriage....", ">Your SIL married into a family that sounds pretty close knit, and she seems to be trying to pull your brother out of it\n\nI think this is it right here. Exactly right.", "I mean if it was between his wife\u2019s basic needs being met and his sister\u2019s basic needs being met, and he couldn\u2019t do both, sure, he should put his wife first. But if my brother was struggling to have his basic needs met, and my spouse went behind my back and did something like this, I\u2019d be reevaluating the entire relationship. Particularly because it sounds like the brother does well financially based on other comments, so there is no question wife\u2019s needs and far beyond are being met.", "Yeah, if he were lending a family member \u20ac5k it would be totally fair to say \"he is a married man (with finances that are to some extent shared) and can't just do that on a whim now.\" But it's absurd to say that over \u20ac50.", "When I told her I needed to pay out of pocket because they didn\u2019t take my insurance, she said \u201cyou know your insurance gives you a booklet with the names of hospitals that you can go to right? Why didn\u2019t you check it before you went in?\u201d And she sounded so condescending. Like yes I made a mistake but I was in so much pain I could hardly give the receptionist my details. My priority was getting to any hospital as quick as I could. The possibility that the hospital doesn\u2019t accept my insurance was the last thing on my mind.", "And clearly she thought her insurance would cover her, so it wasn't like she hadn't planned ahead.", "Yep, most only children have problems with being pushovers, not with sharing.", "I was an only child for 19 years and when I was little I was constantly giving my toys and things away to my friends, which drove my mother mad.", "Not necessarily. When my MIL died one BIL paid for most of the funeral. We paid for FIL, another BIL, and others to get to from Florida to NYC for the funeral. Also, for the hotel rooms. Another BIL hosted a dinner at his home for in and out of town family and helped pay for the funeral. Another BIL said he\u2019d pay for the after  funeral lunch. As is usual lunch was a smaller group, limited menu, and we all paid for own alcohol. So, basically all the expenses were spread among the brothers.\n\nAfterwards SIL, married to the last BIL, sent a bill to all the other brothers to pay for the lunch. No offer to help defray any of the other expenses. In reality it was part of a pattern to push his family to the side.", "And, that's not even always an option, often if you call an ambulance it will take you to a specific hospital, not choice allowed, or certain emergencies go to certain hospitals that are best suited to deal with that emergency. It's a stupid thing to expect of a person to be prepared for every possibility", ">the need to hide \u201cresources\u201d from siblings as a child\n\nYou reminded me of how my brother and I used to steal each other's snacks and money as kids. Sometimes we just did it as revenge for when the other stole from us earlier rather than because we needed it", "I am in this comment and I don't like it.", "She's horribly wrong and OP is definitely NTA. I'm just trying to think of a reason Sara would have the gall to say something like that to her and the \"married man\" thing made me wonder if there was something cultural I've never heard about. When I say immediate family I meant nuclear family as in him, wife and any kids they might have.", "Yikes.", "If they won't take your word for it later, it'll be because you lied now. I'm not trying to make you feel worse! It's just one more reason that being honest with them is a good idea. If you ever feel like you can tell them the truth, you should include these feelings you have in your explanation so that they understand it was never about them, and it will make them hopefully more willing to take you at your word moving forward.

Or like, sees OP as a threat because she is a young woman who is slightly financially dependent on her brothers. \n\neither way, Sara is the real AH here for treating OP like she\u2019s some kind of sugar baby rather than like a member of the family who is in questionable financial straits currently.", "The Uni may offer free counseling to students, mine did (admittedly, that was 25 years ago). If they do, OP, take advantage of it! We all need help sometimes, please take care of yourself.", "They do!
