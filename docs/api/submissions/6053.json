Turns out they don\u2019t accept my insurance and I had to pay out of pocket. I was \u20ac50 short and called everyone I could but no one was picking up.

He told me not to be ridiculous and he didn\u2019t need me to pay him back \u20ac50. \n\nSara called me that night and asked how I was doing. After the chit chat, she asked if I could ask someone else the next time I need money because my brother is a married man. I was shocked but i apologised and said I offered to pay him back. She said it\u2019s fine but next time, I should plan my finances in advance so I won\u2019t have to rely on a married man. \n\nIt\u2019s my birthday soon and Dave called to ask what I wanted. I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking. My other brother called to ask what I want and I said I wanted some money to heat my apartment. I couldn\u2019t afford to heat it this month. He was baffled that I was so broke I couldn\u2019t afford heating and I wasn\u2019t saying anything. He started tearing up on the phone call with me and ended the call, and sent me \u20ac500 later. I guess he told Dave about the call with me because Dave called me and started interrogating me on why I just told him I didn\u2019t need anything, and then asked my youngest brother. He sounded offended and asked why I feel like I can\u2019t rely on him. I asked \u201chaven\u2019t you spoken to Sara about this?\u201d. He was confused on what I meant and I told him about the conversation I had with Sara after he sent me the \u20ac50 for the hospital. He said he\u2019d call me back but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nA cousin of mine sent me a message a few hours ago saying I was a bitch for meddling in their marriage, and that Dave didn\u2019t owe me anything. I was like ???? When did I say Dave owed me anything? I have never relied on him for anything, nor do I plan on it. I mean I feel bad that Dave and Sara are fighting it I can\u2019t help but feel weirded out that Sara did that behind his back and he had no clue.

At a minimum you can benefit from the years of experience they\u2019ve had. \n\nYou\u2019re letting yourself be consumed by guilt and not using the people around you that want to help you. You\u2019re so adamant on being independent you\u2019re not recognizing how your lack of knowledge is making your life harder in the long term. Just because you are younger doesn\u2019t mean you are a burden. You need to seek some therapy and stop seeing yourself that way. \n\nBut talk to your brothers. Sit down on a zoom call with the three of them and be honest. Talk about what your life has been like, why you\u2019ve lied to them and what you felt.

I understand strong feelings of guilt and not wanting to worry the people you love with what\u2019s been going on with you but your brothers clearly love you so much and having them know what you\u2019ve been going through would at the very least probably lighten some of the burden you feel keeping up the lies. \n\nMight I suggest maybe writing everything out in a letter/message and sending it to each of them? It would give you more control on what you say and how you say it, and give you some kind of buffer in the actual delivery so that you don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where you\u2019re face to face with them, and lie again or break down crying and can\u2019t tell them everything properly.", "However heartbreaking it is to see your brothers hurt for you, remember that it's *for you* and not because of you. The more you suffer in silence, the bigger their hurt when they eventually and inevitably find out. It actually seems like the cat is out of the bag now and they'll be asking questions. You asking for heat money isn't something they'll just shrug off.\n\nIf that makes it easier, you don't have to have some big coming clean with everything spilling out. You'll have to muster up the courage to admit a few things, but just saying that you wanted to make it on your own and it simply didn't turn out well should be close to enough. They'd probably even respect that.", "My mum and I aren\u2019t close at all. I haven\u2019t spoken to her much since I moved away. She got remarried and started a new family when my dad died and her new family have been her priority. \n\nI know realistically my brothers could pay for everything happily. They offered to do so when I was applying for universities. But I genuinely thought I could provide for myself without burdening them. Hence why I lied, I thought the truth would never come to light because it wouldn\u2019t need to. I had older friends when I was in high school and they were paying for everything with the money they earned and I thought I could do it too. I was naive and it\u2019s much harder and more emotionally taxing than I thought. I also admit I\u2019m a bit too prideful to ask anyone for help, financial or otherwise. Telling them the truth now will require me telling them a long chain of lies I told since I graduated high school. That won\u2019t be easy. But I\u2019ll try build the courage to do it. I\u2019m starting a new job in Feb that pays \u20ac500 more than my current job and I think that will be enough to get me by so I\u2019m hoping I won\u2019t need their help, but I\u2019ll tell them everything soon hopefully.", "You shouldn't be worried.

And I'd go nuclear and cut contact with Sara completely.", "NTA I find it weird that Sara was using the married man thing as a reason.", "NTA. Sara is, though. My brother is my first phone call if I need anything. His wife is also very supportive of our relationship. Sara doesn\u2019t get him to herself when he has other family and the insinuation that you were after your own brother by repeatedly stating \u201che is a married man\u201d is gross. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA - be honest with your brothers. If you have trouble writing or talking to them, you can send them this post. Maybe this can open up a conversation with them. Good luck. Hugs", " NTA. Your brother was happy to help out and knows his finances well enough to be know what he can afford. But just for my own curiosity, how much would that be in American currency?", "NTA that is messed up. Unless if you are leaving big parts out of the story, like you have a drug addiction and you have a history of repeatedly asking for money from him. I actually really dislike my sister in law and would personally be willing to send her money if she really needed it for something like a hospital bill. I would be more likely to send her money than my husband would. Husband and I have separate finances, he could give his sister as much money as he wants.", "NTA. Your further conversation with Sara implied she did not want to give you any more money. Her comment was quite aggressive, he's not a stranger, he's your brother. It sounds like your brother has had words with her over it and she's trying to play the victim to others. Do not feel bad for any arguments your brother and Sara are having, because they're likely to be about her behavior towards you.", "NTA. Jeez, I thought I'd met some profoundly insecure people until I read about this sister-in-law. Do not trust her, EVER. Go out of your way to avoid her until she sees the error of her ways. Maybe even after that.", "NTA. Sara is the problem, not you.", "First off, ignore cousin. Cousin is the one meddling and she needs to stay in her lane. This is between you and your brothers, and between your brother and his wife. None of cousin's business. Feel free to reply: \"What's between me and brothers is between me and brothers. Please don't meddle in our sibling relationship.\"\n\nSecond, you did everything you could have done to not get caught in the middle between your brother and his wife. You *didn't* go running to your brother when Sara first got ridiculous. You *tried* to respect her wishes even though it was very much not in your own best interest. What were you supposed to do, never ask anyone in your family for help ever again because Dave might find out but he's a \"married man\"?!?!\n\nThird, it is clear from the actions of both of your brothers that they do not want you to struggle if they can help you. You are their little sister! They want you to be ok. Dave is making it clear that he wants you to ask him for help, and that's up to Dave, not Sara. Other people don't get to dictate the relationship between you and each of your brothers. Dave has been your brother a lot longer than he has been Sara's husband.\n\nFourth, Sara is full of it. She's making up rules and then insisting you follow them. You are allowed to ask married men for help. You are allowed to ask your married father, uncles, brothers, sons, friends and neighbors for help. You are also allowed to ask married women for help! It's just asking for help! \n\nFifth, Dave is not angry at you. He was frustrated and confused at first because saying this:\n\n>I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking\n\nWhen you could not afford to heat your apartment was kinda a lie. And when you told other brother the truth, that got back to Dave and he was confused. Maybe frustrated. Didn't know why you didn't tell him sooner. What were you supposed to do? So you simply told Dave the truth. He was angry at Sara when he learned the truth because... he should be. She was awful and she tried to come between her husband and his sister.\n\nYou've been more than fine through all of this. The only thing you could have done differently is when Sara first started making her WEIRD requests you could have pushed back. It doesn't sound like that's your personality, but it would have been OK to have said, \"Yes, I know Dave is now married but he is still my brother and in our family, we turn to each other for help in times of need. Getting married will never change that. If Dave can't help me, he will be the one to let me know.\" I get that you didn't think to say that. Sara was being manipulative (and WEIRD). But you're ok.\n\nTalk to Dave again when you can. Tell him you will go back to asking him for help when in need like you did before. Maybe tell him you don't want to interact with Sara anymore if he's not present. He will understand.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sara ITA. She is manipulative and controlling. And the bit about him being a married man \u2014 what on earth is that supposed to mean?\n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s lying about you behind your back, but that isn\u2019t something you can control. I say this from experience with difficult family members and in-laws. She will say what she says and those who really know you won\u2019t believe her.

Sara should have taken it up with Dave, not you, or at least told Dave about her (very weird IMO) opinions when she relayed them to you.", "NTA, sara and your cousin definitely sound like they might be however. Sara is upset your brother cares for his family (jealousy maybe?) and your cousin obviously hasn\u2019t heard the entire story and is upset because your brother doesn\u2019t owe you anything but you didn\u2019t even ask which is what resulting in your telling Dave about the conversation you thought he knew about", "NTA. Looks like Sara already had this financial conversation with Dave. He must have said he would support OP regardless of her view. Then she went behind his back directly to OP to get her way. But that\u2019s just my opinion. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA but it is interesting that Sarah would 1, go behind her husband's back in the 1st place. 2, when called out her first response was to badmouth you to all the family.

Instead of talking to him about it, she scolded you and demanded that you change your relationship dynamic with your brother. She also expected you to keep it from Dave so she doesn't look like a bad guy. Nope. \n\nGoing forward, be straight up honest: \"Sara doesn't want me receiving anything from you now that you're married to her.\" If Dave has a problem with that then his problem is with Sara and not you. Never let Sara be a go-between you and Dave, since she's proven herself to be deceitful. Ignore the cousin. That's just a flying monkey.\n\nBut do tell your other brothers about your finances. They clearly care deeply about you, and as weird as this sounds, it's actually an act of love to let them in on your struggles rather than keep it from them.", "NTA- Sara acted hateful and didn't expect Dave to ever find out.

She definitely deserves it.\n\nEditing to add: Please be more honest with your brothers. Things don\u2019t have to get worse before you ask for help. If you ask for help sooner, sometimes it will stop situations from becoming worse. This isn\u2019t me blaming you at all OP, it\u2019s not me saying you did everything wrong. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m saying this. Hindsight is 20/20 but one way that the situation with Sara could have been managed earlier is, if Dave was informed of his wife\u2019s behavior after it happened. \n\nHugs to you. Do not suffer needlessly. Your brothers love you. Not all of us have healthy relationships with family and you\u2019re not a burden to them at all.
