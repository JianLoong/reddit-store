Turns out they don\u2019t accept my insurance and I had to pay out of pocket. I was \u20ac50 short and called everyone I could but no one was picking up.

He told me not to be ridiculous and he didn\u2019t need me to pay him back \u20ac50. \n\nSara called me that night and asked how I was doing. After the chit chat, she asked if I could ask someone else the next time I need money because my brother is a married man. I was shocked but i apologised and said I offered to pay him back. She said it\u2019s fine but next time, I should plan my finances in advance so I won\u2019t have to rely on a married man. \n\nIt\u2019s my birthday soon and Dave called to ask what I wanted. I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking. My other brother called to ask what I want and I said I wanted some money to heat my apartment. I couldn\u2019t afford to heat it this month. He was baffled that I was so broke I couldn\u2019t afford heating and I wasn\u2019t saying anything. He started tearing up on the phone call with me and ended the call, and sent me \u20ac500 later. I guess he told Dave about the call with me because Dave called me and started interrogating me on why I just told him I didn\u2019t need anything, and then asked my youngest brother. He sounded offended and asked why I feel like I can\u2019t rely on him. I asked \u201chaven\u2019t you spoken to Sara about this?\u201d. He was confused on what I meant and I told him about the conversation I had with Sara after he sent me the \u20ac50 for the hospital. He said he\u2019d call me back but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nA cousin of mine sent me a message a few hours ago saying I was a bitch for meddling in their marriage, and that Dave didn\u2019t owe me anything. I was like ???? When did I say Dave owed me anything? I have never relied on him for anything, nor do I plan on it. I mean I feel bad that Dave and Sara are fighting it I can\u2019t help but feel weirded out that Sara did that behind his back and he had no clue.

At a minimum you can benefit from the years of experience they\u2019ve had. \n\nYou\u2019re letting yourself be consumed by guilt and not using the people around you that want to help you.

Just because you are younger doesn\u2019t mean you are a burden. You need to seek some therapy and stop seeing yourself that way. \n\nBut talk to your brothers. Sit down on a zoom call with the three of them and be honest. Talk about what your life has been like, why you\u2019ve lied to them and what you felt.

I understand strong feelings of guilt and not wanting to worry the people you love with what\u2019s been going on with you but your brothers clearly love you so much and having them know what you\u2019ve been going through would at the very least probably lighten some of the burden you feel keeping up the lies. \n\nMight I suggest maybe writing everything out in a letter/message and sending it to each of them? It would give you more control on what you say and how you say it, and give you some kind of buffer in the actual delivery so that you don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where you\u2019re face to face with them, and lie again or break down crying and can\u2019t tell them everything properly.", "However heartbreaking it is to see your brothers hurt for you, remember that it's *for you* and not because of you. The more you suffer in silence, the bigger their hurt when they eventually and inevitably find out. It actually seems like the cat is out of the bag now and they'll be asking questions. You asking for heat money isn't something they'll just shrug off.\n\nIf that makes it easier, you don't have to have some big coming clean with everything spilling out. You'll have to muster up the courage to admit a few things, but just saying that you wanted to make it on your own and it simply didn't turn out well should be close to enough. They'd probably even respect that.", "My mum and I aren\u2019t close at all. I haven\u2019t spoken to her much since I moved away. She got remarried and started a new family when my dad died and her new family have been her priority. \n\nI know realistically my brothers could pay for everything happily. They offered to do so when I was applying for universities. But I genuinely thought I could provide for myself without burdening them. Hence why I lied, I thought the truth would never come to light because it wouldn\u2019t need to. I had older friends when I was in high school and they were paying for everything with the money they earned and I thought I could do it too. I was naive and it\u2019s much harder and more emotionally taxing than I thought. I also admit I\u2019m a bit too prideful to ask anyone for help, financial or otherwise. Telling them the truth now will require me telling them a long chain of lies I told since I graduated high school. That won\u2019t be easy. But I\u2019ll try build the courage to do it. I\u2019m starting a new job in Feb that pays \u20ac500 more than my current job and I think that will be enough to get me by so I\u2019m hoping I won\u2019t need their help, but I\u2019ll tell them everything soon hopefully.", "You shouldn't be worried.

And I'd go nuclear and cut contact with Sara completely.", "NTA I find it weird that Sara was using the married man thing as a reason.", "NTA. Sara is, though. My brother is my first phone call if I need anything. His wife is also very supportive of our relationship. Sara doesn\u2019t get him to herself when he has other family and the insinuation that you were after your own brother by repeatedly stating \u201che is a married man\u201d is gross. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA - be honest with your brothers. If you have trouble writing or talking to them, you can send them this post. Maybe this can open up a conversation with them. Good luck. Hugs", " NTA. Your brother was happy to help out and knows his finances well enough to be know what he can afford. But just for my own curiosity, how much would that be in American currency?", "NTA that is messed up. Unless if you are leaving big parts out of the story, like you have a drug addiction and you have a history of repeatedly asking for money from him. I actually really dislike my sister in law and would personally be willing to send her money if she really needed it for something like a hospital bill. I would be more likely to send her money than my husband would. Husband and I have separate finances, he could give his sister as much money as he wants.", "NTA. Your further conversation with Sara implied she did not want to give you any more money. Her comment was quite aggressive, he's not a stranger, he's your brother. It sounds like your brother has had words with her over it and she's trying to play the victim to others. Do not feel bad for any arguments your brother and Sara are having, because they're likely to be about her behavior towards you.", "NTA. Jeez, I thought I'd met some profoundly insecure people until I read about this sister-in-law. Do not trust her, EVER. Go out of your way to avoid her until she sees the error of her ways. Maybe even after that.", "NTA. Sara is the problem, not you.", "First off, ignore cousin. Cousin is the one meddling and she needs to stay in her lane. This is between you and your brothers, and between your brother and his wife. None of cousin's business. Feel free to reply: \"What's between me and brothers is between me and brothers. Please don't meddle in our sibling relationship.\"\n\nSecond, you did everything you could have done to not get caught in the middle between your brother and his wife. You *didn't* go running to your brother when Sara first got ridiculous. You *tried* to respect her wishes even though it was very much not in your own best interest. What were you supposed to do, never ask anyone in your family for help ever again because Dave might find out but he's a \"married man\"?!?!\n\nThird, it is clear from the actions of both of your brothers that they do not want you to struggle if they can help you. You are their little sister! They want you to be ok. Dave is making it clear that he wants you to ask him for help, and that's up to Dave, not Sara. Other people don't get to dictate the relationship between you and each of your brothers. Dave has been your brother a lot longer than he has been Sara's husband.\n\nFourth, Sara is full of it. She's making up rules and then insisting you follow them. You are allowed to ask married men for help. You are allowed to ask your married father, uncles, brothers, sons, friends and neighbors for help. You are also allowed to ask married women for help! It's just asking for help! \n\nFifth, Dave is not angry at you. He was frustrated and confused at first because saying this:\n\n>I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking\n\nWhen you could not afford to heat your apartment was kinda a lie. And when you told other brother the truth, that got back to Dave and he was confused. Maybe frustrated. Didn't know why you didn't tell him sooner. What were you supposed to do? So you simply told Dave the truth. He was angry at Sara when he learned the truth because... he should be. She was awful and she tried to come between her husband and his sister.\n\nYou've been more than fine through all of this. The only thing you could have done differently is when Sara first started making her WEIRD requests you could have pushed back. It doesn't sound like that's your personality, but it would have been OK to have said, \"Yes, I know Dave is now married but he is still my brother and in our family, we turn to each other for help in times of need. Getting married will never change that. If Dave can't help me, he will be the one to let me know.\" I get that you didn't think to say that. Sara was being manipulative (and WEIRD). But you're ok.\n\nTalk to Dave again when you can. Tell him you will go back to asking him for help when in need like you did before. Maybe tell him you don't want to interact with Sara anymore if he's not present. He will understand.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sara ITA. She is manipulative and controlling. And the bit about him being a married man \u2014 what on earth is that supposed to mean?\n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s lying about you behind your back, but that isn\u2019t something you can control. I say this from experience with difficult family members and in-laws. She will say what she says and those who really know you won\u2019t believe her.

Sara should have taken it up with Dave, not you, or at least told Dave about her (very weird IMO) opinions when she relayed them to you.", "NTA, sara and your cousin definitely sound like they might be however. Sara is upset your brother cares for his family (jealousy maybe?) and your cousin obviously hasn\u2019t heard the entire story and is upset because your brother doesn\u2019t owe you anything but you didn\u2019t even ask which is what resulting in your telling Dave about the conversation you thought he knew about", "NTA. Looks like Sara already had this financial conversation with Dave. He must have said he would support OP regardless of her view. Then she went behind his back directly to OP to get her way. But that\u2019s just my opinion. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA but it is interesting that Sarah would 1, go behind her husband's back in the 1st place. 2, when called out her first response was to badmouth you to all the family.

Instead of talking to him about it, she scolded you and demanded that you change your relationship dynamic with your brother. She also expected you to keep it from Dave so she doesn't look like a bad guy. Nope. \n\nGoing forward, be straight up honest: \"Sara doesn't want me receiving anything from you now that you're married to her.\" If Dave has a problem with that then his problem is with Sara and not you. Never let Sara be a go-between you and Dave, since she's proven herself to be deceitful. Ignore the cousin. That's just a flying monkey.\n\nBut do tell your other brothers about your finances. They clearly care deeply about you, and as weird as this sounds, it's actually an act of love to let them in on your struggles rather than keep it from them.", "NTA- Sara acted hateful and didn't expect Dave to ever find out.

If any of them come at you again like that and more importantly, if you\u2019re in the headspace to do it because your health comes first, ask them exactly what Sara told them. \n\nSara tried to pull bullshit btwn your brother and you, but the truth flung the shit right back at her face. She definitely deserves it.", "Your brother married someone more than happy to be nasty behind his back. She hid it cause she knew he'd be furious and rightfully so. Honestly this would be marriage ending for me if any man of mine did this to my baby sister. My sister means the world to me and if my spouse can't respect even that much they clearly don't love and respect me and my priorities enough. Id bet your brother feels the same and at the least he probably feels he needs to reassess the type of women he married now he's seen some nasty colors. She lied and manipulated him and he just had a nasty truth bite him in the ass very suddenly with no warning. Thats on his wife not you so don't blame yourself for even a second. \n\nAlso I hope things get better for you. Life is freaking hard right now and I'm sorry you've felt alone dealing with it. Remember its ok to talk to people about your struggles and please tell your brothers next time something like this happens, what his wife did was absolutely not ok and her seeing you as a love rival is gross for many reasons. And next time while its hard I promise you its ok to ask for help.\n\nNTA", "NTA   \nYour meddling cousin has it backwards: You are not meddling in your brother's marriage; Sara is meddling in her husband's family relations.  You were even generous enough to honor Sara's strange request. When your brother asked you were honest and also encouraged him to talk to his wife, so they could perhaps get on the same page.   You have done nothing wrong in this matter; you sound like a very kind, sympathetic person.  I hope your financial situation gets better in the new year; meanwhile, there's no shame I getting help in tough times.", "You\u2019re NTA, but don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know exactly what you were doing when you asked, \u201chaven\u2019t you spoken to Sara about this?\u201d", "yes i am \n\nfart", "NTA\n\nThis is too much. You should always be able to ask your bro for help, \u201cmarried man\u201d (yuck!) or otherwise! (And sounds like he agreed)\n\nI hope it works out!

Obviously OP is NTA.", "This. Next time Sara calls and asks you to repay something or in any way gives you a hard time, simply ask her \"did you discuss this with my brother? I'm going to text him right now to make sure he is in agreement.\" It will shut it down immediately.", "Agreed that and Op make Sara strangely jealous.", ">YTA. You should never apologise.\n\nShe's not an asshole for that, tf...", "I\u2019m an only child and I\u2019m overly generous because I\u2019m just excited to have someone to share with!", "Maybe she's sending money to her family lol", "NTA. Sara is the issue op. she appears to be an AH.", "> I'm just curious how Sara expected OP to plan their finances for a medical emergency? Edit: seeing as by definition you can't plan an emergency\n\nYou keep an emergency fund. An emergency does not mean something that one can not be prepared for. It just means something that is time bound and cannot wait.", "My dog is more discreet when he marks trees and bushes in the neighbourhood...\n\nShe's so possessive I imagine what else she does in her community.", "Probably like she has dibs on cash", "It is her subtle jab that she controls the money when she obviously doesn\u2019t since she isn\u2019t going to tell her husband not supporting family.", "I was wondering the same thing like ewwww", "And then block the cousin.", "I guarantee the cousin wasn\u2019t told the truth. Hoped OP recognizes that and sets cousin straight when the time is right.", "Seriously: you mean like you are meddling in mine right now? between me and my brother.\n\nAlso OP we will need an update.", "Never mess with the baby sibling. I'm a grown ass adult who owns a home and is financially stable. But I have two older brothers who still won't let me pay for my own food if we go out for dinner.", "That\u2019s one word for it. I have less charitable ones at hand.", "I have a unique perspective: I'm 12-17 years younger than my siblings. I was homeschooled while they were public schooled. So I grew up like an only child. I would say I'm pretty generous as an adult and don't have that \"forced to share\" mentality, while also still having an idea of what it meant to share a bathroom with my sis and steal her stuff. \n\nSara seems like my ex sis in law, who was also an only child but came from a broken family. She married into my family for looks (wanted the family life we presented) but did her best to seperate my brother from us through gas lighting and emotional abuse. Later did the same to her kids. No one talks to her, her kids literally threw their copy of her house key in the trash.", "I\u2019m the youngest by decades and have NEVER needed to give/loan money to my siblings who have been very generous about helping me with my undergrad and master\u2019s degree. I know that there\u2019s the stereotype that the baby of the family is super selfish and don\u2019t think about others because they\u2019ve never needed to, but I actually feel a lot of anxiety about this imbalance- and forward what I can to my nieces and nephews\u2026 my sisters used to try to shove money into my hands when I\u2019m taking their kids out to do stuff LOL", "I\u2019ve never heard of a culture that wants you to turn your back on your family though!!", "Unfortunately it happens all the time. My older brothers' girlfriends always treated me horribly. Not sure why, I was a total geek and they were jealous and awful to me for some reason. For OP's sake I hope her brother sets his wife straight.\n\nOP - NTA", "Who lives half way around the world....", "Bc cousin didn\u2019t get the real story, guaranteed.", "My youngest sister is the same but if someone messed with her? Oh hell no. My brother and I don\u2019t even get along but if someone tried to hurt me he\u2019d lose his shit. Sibling things can be weird and volatile to each other but protective as fuck.", "Dunno. My stepmom was extremely jealous of my Dads (they were married for over 20 years) kids and grandkids. She specifically hated any attention he gave anyone other than her. It was so bad that she would make excuses for him to do shit specifically to get him away from sitting next to his toddler grandchildren.  Totally twisted.\n\nGod forbid I went to the store with my Dad tye phone rang off the hook. The only time he could ignore her ass was when he went to the store without her. Then the bitching commenced. \n\nNTA SIL is off her rocker.", "My sister had a breathing emergency and called the ambulance.  They asked where she wanted to go and she said the closest.  She didn't realize that the hospital they took her to wasn't on her insurance.  Luckily, her insurance covers emergency at any hospital.  We later looked up affiliate hospitals just in case there is a next time and it turns out the hospital just 1/10th of a mile farther is an affiliate.  Now she knows, but when you are having an emergency, the last thing you are thinking is I need to check which hospital to go to.", "This reminds me when I got sick during the height of covid and had to go get tested (before the kits were out, was negative). I was so out of it after the third time trying to say my postal code the nurse in a dead pan voice said \"NOPE\" (I don't even think I said enough letters/numbers). Thankfully my then GF (now Wife) helped out. \n\nI live in Canada and couldn't even imagine having to deal with insurance on top of everything else alone.", "Avoid the cousin as well op", "I think so that op's brother will back on the right track.", "You are quite right. This is simply absurd.", "And money she needed for a hospital stay! It wasn't for trifles or extra gas money.", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m liking your comment or not but I agree! (Red is disagree and blue is agree??)", "You start at the beginning. You just start at the beginning.", "Would you consider sharing this post with them?", "Oldest sibling here too, tell your brothers. They\u2019ll be me more mad about the debt especially if they have the ability to help which sounds like they do and that they want to help you.", "I understand what you mean about not wanting to see them hurting for you, and not wanting to be a burden, but have you considered that they might appreciate the trust that you'd be showing them by telling the truth? As well as the opportunity to help you when you truly need it. \n\n\nIt's late and I might not be expressing this well, but like..  okay, which is going to hurt them worse- a) having you tell them the truth now, when there's something they can do to help you, or b) finding out later on that while they were living (more than) comfortable lives, traveling, buying lavish gifts, you were living without heat and maybe other necessities as well? Missing Christmas with them because you couldn't afford it? Losing time with them that you can't get back? Etc. \n\n\nAnd I know you never planned on telling them, but OP, the truth always comes out. I admire your desire to do everything on your own, I really do. I struggle with letting people help me. But you have a family that loves you, wants to help, and had the ability to do so. Really think about that, okay?", "I guess he was tearing up because you hurt him deeply by not accepting his help and making him feel unwanted by you.", "Friend, I am sure helping you makes your brothers feel good. THe loss of your father, I'm sure, makes them feel very protective of you and makes them WANT to help you. Please do not lie or deceive them - they need to know where things really stand with you. \n\nMy suggestion is to set up a zoom call with all 3 of them for a day this coming weekend. A \"clear the air\" conversation. Tell them you have deceived them because in the past you felt like a burden but the dishonesty just hurts everyone. Then, clear the air. Explain the medical situation. Explain why you called to ask for the $50. Explain the call from your SIL and the heating situation. Explain the entire financial picture but also the emotional picture.\n\nAs a big sibling, I know I WANT to help my siblings where I can and I feel impotent when I can't, but I always rather know what is going on with them so I can help in any way possible. Likewise, I know they feel the same way.\n\nSara has problems - your brother also needs to know that she is trying to get in the way of the sibling relationship. If your cousin calls or texts you again, deflect her back to your brothers.", "You aren't a burden when they offer to help you. You really need to accept their help.", "I get it, Im the same way but as the oldest sibling who did the caretaking for my younger sister. We\u2019re both in our 30s and i still call her my baby. And i have a terrible time letting anybody, even my fianc\u00e9, take care of me in any way.\n\nBut listen - the best advice i\u2019ve ever been given is to not rob others of the joy of caring for you. It\u2019s selfish! Even when we think we\u2019re doing them a favor and not wanting to be a burden, we\u2019re hurting them.", "If you don\u2019t tell them your struggles, then you aren\u2019t telling them everything.\n\nThe thing is is that most people only tell their struggles to the closest and most intimate people in their lives. You withholding that from them is sending a message implicitly. It\u2019s not like I tell my coworkers, my deep and dark thoughts and fears. \n\nI think my only warning here is for you to ensure that they know you want them to be part of your life. As long as they know, you want them to be part of your life, I think the relationship you build with your brothers as an adult will most likely carry on well into adulthood. But if at some point, they feel like they\u2019re consistently pushed away and not needed, one day they just may not be there when you do really need them and you won\u2019t know how to get them", "It's OK to need help when you're 19! That's TOTALLY fine, when I was 19 I would also ask my parents for help when my part time job couldn't cover my expenses while I was at university. I'm in my 30s now and yeah, I'd feel like a burden asking for money NOW, I haven't for many years but it's completely normal for you to be needing help when you're still a student!", "Consider what it's like when someone you're close to asks you for help and you are able to provide that help. It feels good and increases your closeness. That is not a burden. Your brothers coming to realize that they aren't sure if you're ok and they may need to worry more about your situation might be, though.\n\nThis is the hardest point in your adult life to be self sufficient. You will have opportunities to pay it back many times in the future but in the meantime make sure you're getting enough food, your heat is on, you have adequate medical care, etc so that.you can get to that point", "I think you are deeply hurting them by not being honest with them. It's that really what you want?", "As the older sister (15 years older) of a young woman who also lost her dad, I feel incredibly protective of my youngest. I cared about her my whole life. If I ever knew she had any hardship I would come to her rescue immediately and I\u2019d cry, just like your brother did, if I knew she went through any difficulty. Please let your brothers help you. Or in the immortal words of Jerry McGuire, \u201cHelp me help you!\u201d. They won\u2019t hold any grudges against you for not telling them earlier. I promise. And you\u2019ll feel so much lighter and relieved! Just go for it! I wish you the best of luck OP! Also, fuck Sara.", "I think I said less polite words \ud83d\ude09", "Our local health system, which has a monopoly on Healthcare across two states here, has this cute little trick where the hospital itself is in network for most insurances offered in the area, BUT, the doctors are all from another state and are almost exclusively out of network.  It's adorable and should be criminal.", "US healthcare sucks - the fact that this is even a consideration in a first-world country is just staggering. And none of this is about actual health outcomes, it's all about keeping the middle man fat and rolling in dough. SMDH.", "Up is agree. ;)", "The letters sound like a great idea! But please make sure your brother actually gets the letter, and Sara doesn't have a chance to intercept it.", "That\u2019s such epic bullshit", "Ands what\u2019s with the married man thing?! As if SIL would never ask her dad or uncle for a favor. So weird and an inappropriate thought for her to have", "Admitting you were wrong and asking for help requires a different kind of strength and humility- but it still requires strength and humility, which are admirable traits to possess. Do not let pride prevent you for asking your brothers for some assistance.", "I know you were sad your brother was upset but he was upset that you were suffering and didn\u2019t tell him so he could help. That doesn\u2019t mean he would want you to carry on struggling alone, in fact exactly the opposite. Your brothers care and want you to be safe and able to focus on your education. They will understand if you open up because you weren\u2019t lying with a bad motive but to protect them but that\u2019s what they want to do for you. Please give them a chance.", "It is.  I know of one lady that had her baby, checked all the boxes for her doctors and made 100% sure it was all in network.  She had an emergency after the birth and got a $20K bill for out of network because they didn't call her OB, they called the general surgeon on call.  Sure, he saved her life, but $20K for an hour long surgery? And she works for the same hospital.  Her insurance company fought the bill for her and told her not to stress or worry, that it would be handled and she would owe nothing, but it's how they are getting around those on Medicare/Medicaid.  Those folks don't have the resources that those with private insurance do and for the elderly, it can cost them everything and for low income folks, it can keep them with nothing.  And there are literally no other options in this area.  I'm lucky enough to be able to drive one county over to use another health system, but for those living in the middle of the Southwest VA/upper East TN area, it could mean hundreds of miles to better healthcare..", "It is SO weird. \n\nI mean, you can\u2019t tell from the post but I wonder if SIL doesn\u2019t like/is jealous of the relationship OP and her bro have and she wants it to stop. She might have used the married man thing as an excuse bc she couldn\u2019t just tell OP to get lost.", "I have a chronic illness that makes me increasingly reliant on others. I absolutely hate it. However, therapy did help me see that no one helping me feels put out. He did this by making me talk about the pleasure I get from helping others. It\u2019s still something I don\u2019t like but I use his words to remind me that my insistence on self reliance means no one can experience the pleasure of helping me when I need it.", "Yeah you\u2019re right that should be criminal. Any doctor working at a hospital should be in that hospitals network.", "You would think that would make sense. I'm honestly very lucky with my employer.  They not only provide amazing healthcare benefits, but they offer a free rider for this type of thing (so it obviously isn't isolated). Im covered if anything happens to me or my family (they also offer this type of rider policy to any family member of their employees, regardless of dependent status, so I can include everyone if they want), but for those that don't have this coverage, it can be devastating.  I think I'll take this cause up after the first of the year and start lobbying state reps.  Probably won't go anywhere and I'll most likely get some anger issues from it, but it'll give me something to do"]}
