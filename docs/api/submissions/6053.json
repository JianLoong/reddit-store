My oldest brother (Dave) got married to Sara in May.\n\nI study halfway across the world from my hometown where my family are. I got really sick a few months ago and rushed to the nearest hospital. Turns out they don\u2019t accept my insurance and I had to pay out of pocket. I was \u20ac50 short and called everyone I could but no one was picking up. I then called my oldest brother (Dave) because he always picks up and asked him to send me \u20ac50 and I would send it back once I get paid in a few days. He told me not to be ridiculous and he didn\u2019t need me to pay him back \u20ac50. \n\nSara called me that night and asked how I was doing. After the chit chat, she asked if I could ask someone else the next time I need money because my brother is a married man. I was shocked but i apologised and said I offered to pay him back. She said it\u2019s fine but next time, I should plan my finances in advance so I won\u2019t have to rely on a married man. \n\nIt\u2019s my birthday soon and Dave called to ask what I wanted. I said nothing and that I was fine but I appreciated him asking. My other brother called to ask what I want and I said I wanted some money to heat my apartment. I couldn\u2019t afford to heat it this month. He was baffled that I was so broke I couldn\u2019t afford heating and I wasn\u2019t saying anything. He started tearing up on the phone call with me and ended the call, and sent me \u20ac500 later. I guess he told Dave about the call with me because Dave called me and started interrogating me on why I just told him I didn\u2019t need anything, and then asked my youngest brother. He sounded offended and asked why I feel like I can\u2019t rely on him. I asked \u201chaven\u2019t you spoken to Sara about this?\u201d. He was confused on what I meant and I told him about the conversation I had with Sara after he sent me the \u20ac50 for the hospital. He said he\u2019d call me back but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nA cousin of mine sent me a message a few hours ago saying I was a bitch for meddling in their marriage, and that Dave didn\u2019t owe me anything. I was like ???? When did I say Dave owed me anything? I have never relied on him for anything, nor do I plan on it. I mean I feel bad that Dave and Sara are fighting it I can\u2019t help but feel weirded out that Sara did that behind his back and he had no clue.

Your brothers was to support and look out for you and you\u2019re pushing them away because you feel trapped by your lies. You need to stop this and let them help you. At a minimum you can benefit from the years of experience they\u2019ve had. \n\nYou\u2019re letting yourself be consumed by guilt and not using the people around you that want to help you. You\u2019re so adamant on being independent you\u2019re not recognizing how your lack of knowledge is making your life harder in the long term. Just because you are younger doesn\u2019t mean you are a burden. You need to seek some therapy and stop seeing yourself that way. \n\nBut talk to your brothers. Sit down on a zoom call with the three of them and be honest. Talk about what your life has been like, why you\u2019ve lied to them and what you felt.

They had a very lavish wedding so maybe that took a big hit to his finances and he was too proud to say anything.

They also travel A LOT together so he\u2019s definitely not struggling. \n\nHe and my other two brothers offered to pay my entire university tuition when I was applying to universities but I grew up thinking I was a burden and I still struggle with that. I lied to my family that I got a full scholarship (to be fair, it\u2019s a 25% scholarship so definitely better than nothing) but I\u2019m paying for my tuition myself.

You have to be deeply sick and insecure to feel threatened by your husbands little sister.", "Most sole children I've known while growing up were actually more generous than myself and others who had siblings, likely because they've never been pressured to share or contend for anything. I suppose an argument can be made in the opposite direction, but surely there's something else very wrong with her. This isn't mere selfishness.", "I'm wondering if Sara is from a culture where being a married man carries some different significance than it does for Westerners. Like a married man can only spend his money on his own immediate family or something?", "You need to stop deceiving your brothers.\n\nUnderstand that you don\u2019t have to accept their gifts or aid but not being honest with them about your situation will probably make them feel like you don\u2019t like them or trust them.

Hopefully, you aren\u2019t taking on undue hardship with tuition fees (though considering you are using the euro symbol hopefully they aren\u2019t as bad as US tuitions)\n\nConsidering how mad Sarah got about \u20ac50 I don\u2019t think she would have survived hearing that your brother is paying for your tuition. \n\nI really think you should come clean about your situation to your siblings and about how you feel as if you are a burden because it would be heartbreaking to hear your sibling is struggling and not knowing why.

I want to cry my eyes out just thinking of them worrying about me. Admitting that I wanted money for heating is the most I\u2019ve admitted about my struggles in years, so hopefully that\u2019s the start of me being honest with them.

Tbf my debt isn\u2019t huge. It\u2019s \u20ac900 ish at the moment. I manage to pay most of my tuition and my rent with what I make. I have so so much that I\u2019ve lied about regarding finances that I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start with coming clean. I haven\u2019t even gone home for Christmas because I couldn\u2019t afford the trip but I lied that I couldn\u2019t take time off work.

Seeing my brothers hurt in any way is so heartbreaking for me. I didn\u2019t mean to keep the lies going this long.

I would start by talking to one of your brothers about the current situation and your fears that you have and are being a burden on them and their relationships.  You can then ask to eventually talk more when you are in a better situation but your brother\u2019s just want you to be safe and happy.  You truly and honestly showing them this is the best thing you can do.", "Tell your brothers your struggles please.  They would rather know now and help you then let it get so deep you don\u2019t communicate at all.  They sound like an incredible support system and you are fortunate to have them.

Where\u2019s your mom in all this schooling away from home, not a full ride, and not enough money to live on. Time for a family meeting. Your brother\u2019s tears  breaks your heart and you can\u2019t confide in him???  If your 3 brothers contribute $50-100 a month could you make it then?  Let your family assist you, and you will do the same for your future nieces and nephews.", "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that \ud83d\ude14. I understand strong feelings of guilt and not wanting to worry the people you love with what\u2019s been going on with you but your brothers clearly love you so much and having them know what you\u2019ve been going through would at the very least probably lighten some of the burden you feel keeping up the lies. \n\nMight I suggest maybe writing everything out in a letter/message and sending it to each of them? It would give you more control on what you say and how you say it, and give you some kind of buffer in the actual delivery so that you don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where you\u2019re face to face with them, and lie again or break down crying and can\u2019t tell them everything properly.", "However heartbreaking it is to see your brothers hurt for you, remember that it's *for you* and not because of you. The more you suffer in silence, the bigger their hurt when they eventually and inevitably find out. It actually seems like the cat is out of the bag now and they'll be asking questions. You asking for heat money isn't something they'll just shrug off.\n\nIf that makes it easier, you don't have to have some big coming clean with everything spilling out. You'll have to muster up the courage to admit a few things, but just saying that you wanted to make it on your own and it simply didn't turn out well should be close to enough. They'd probably even respect that.", "My mum and I aren\u2019t close at all. I haven\u2019t spoken to her much since I moved away. She got remarried and started a new family when my dad died and her new family have been her priority. \n\nI know realistically my brothers could pay for everything happily. They offered to do so when I was applying for universities. But I genuinely thought I could provide for myself without burdening them. Hence why I lied, I thought the truth would never come to light because it wouldn\u2019t need to. I had older friends when I was in high school and they were paying for everything with the money they earned and I thought I could do it too. I was naive and it\u2019s much harder and more emotionally taxing than I thought. I also admit I\u2019m a bit too prideful to ask anyone for help, financial or otherwise. Telling them the truth now will require me telling them a long chain of lies I told since I graduated high school. That won\u2019t be easy. But I\u2019ll try build the courage to do it. I\u2019m starting a new job in Feb that pays \u20ac500 more than my current job and I think that will be enough to get me by so I\u2019m hoping I won\u2019t need their help, but I\u2019ll tell them everything soon hopefully."]}
