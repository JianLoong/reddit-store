Kind of glad you're not related to me.", "Was the cousin there? You didn't say it to her, you said it to her father.  ESH, but it is an entirely reasonable emotional response to hear someone who harmed you intentionally has suffered a tragedy and think \"Good.\"\n\nIdeally, we keep these thoughts in our heads, but the fact her father came to you expecting you to be sympathetic, after trying to minimize your injury, makes me wonder why you haven't gone no contact with that entire branch of the family.", "YTA. What kind of fucking prank did she do that warrants saying she deserved to have her wanted child die?", "What family sues each other over cousins getting tangled? You all suck. You deserved to say something, but probably not that...", "ESH\n\nYour cousin is a monster, that does not justify acting like a monster toward her.", "NTA  stay away from this people as far away as possible.", "NTA you\u2018re right. she was not fit to be a parent and god took care of it. It\u2018s a sad thing but sometimes it\u2018s better to not be born at all if you have a fucked up family like this.", "You\u2019re both assholes. BUT I feel like you\u2019re 100% within your rights to be an asshole in this situation. I\u2019d probably do literally the exact same things. Sometimes it\u2019s fine to take up the asshole banner and this is a perfect situation imho. You should not feel bad about this.", "NTA. \n\nInfo: what was the prank?", "ESH\n\nwhat was done to you is not acceptable and I do not blame you for refusing to accept apologies or forgive\n\nbut there are some things you do not wish on people or celebrate when it happens to them.  And a miscarriage is one of them.", "Why lower yourself to their level of pettiness?\n\nMoving on is the best revenge, you need to grow up.\n\nYes, you're a massive asshole. The child died - Not your cousin.", "She really doesn't deserve to be a parent", "NTA\n\nPeople missed the part where Rachel didn\u2019t choose to come clean. She made a stupid social media post, then her family FORCED her to apologize. There\u2019s no indication she had any real remorse beyond \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got caught\u201d. Rachel isn\u2019t some teenager who doesn\u2019t know any better. She\u2019s a woman in her mid 20s\n\nHer goal was to permanently alienate the OP from the family for the rest of their lives. A miscarriage is a devastating experience, but attempting to take away someone\u2019s family and potentially their entire life (due to the risk of the lawsuit) is also devastating. \n\nNot to mention the miscarriage has nothing to do with OP and OP didn\u2019t make the comment in front of her, but they feel OP has some duty to comfort her.

That doesn't mean you have to laugh at her about it because she \"deserved\" it. Thats a horrible way to feel.

I get why you feel the way that you do, and you have a right to feel that way.
