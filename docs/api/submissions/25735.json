If he was sick of it he would have communicated that before the surgery or you can wait for him to do it after he recovers. Maybe this is just because I\u2019m a lawyer but it\u2019s not unreasonable for adult children to have questions about the will when there is a step parent involved.

You are protecting your husband right now, and you are not in the wrong. He needs peace as he recovers, and you didn't ban them forever. Just until he is feeling better.

After they're gone, it will be hard to make the case that any one person manipulated them into a bigger share if we all talk regularly and openly about their intentions while they're still here. If your husband is refusing to tell them what they should expect when he passes, then they probably, understandably, have a lot of anxiety about it, especially if you openly dislike them. You're the younger woman who married their wealthy dad, after all. If you're upset that they don't visit enough, throwing them out of their family home when they do is not going to help matters any.
