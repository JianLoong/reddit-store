This was early 90s. He got a call from her husband and discovered that she was in fact married, not even filed for divorce. Her husband asked my father to stop seeing his wife so, my dad, shocked and hurt, cut her off completely. FF 26 years, a girl messages MY HUSBAND, not me, and asks if I'm around him. My husband calls me and tells me about the strange message and I'm immediately weirded out because I know that name, she had just followed me on Instagram. I tell him to find out what she wants (at this point I'm assuming she is wanting my husband and im panicked) She then tells my husband that she's my half sister. My husband calls me distraught (he called my dad first like wtf) and tells me the news. Apparently my dad had asked her (just a few days prior when he himself found out) to allow him to tell us and she wanted to just drop a bomb on us (he knows my mental health history and knew it needed to be gently broken to me). \n\nHer mother has 5 kids, each with a different man and told her that her father was so and so. She had taken a 23 and me and found out that man was not her father, then someone else was named as her father. Also wrong. Her mom wasn't sure but then named my dad. My dad had told her that 1.) He would like to have a DNA test performed to confirm and 2.) He had to be the one to tell us because his 2 daughters were sensitive and we may be upset. \n\nI have talked to her via text twice. She is consistently rude, jaded and nasty. I feel as though she presented herself to me/my sister in this way to sabotage my father. She accused my father of knowing (even though the man she thought was her father also thought she was his daughter!) My father is a good man and couldn't have lived with himself knowing she existed and was his. Her mom has bounced around from man to man her entire life and has cheated in every relationship. My father would have fought for custody of her and won and raised her with us (when we were eventually born).\n\nThe way she dropped this bomb on me and my family has been traumatizing and I wish my father could have sorted this out and broken it to us. She showed up in the city I live in one day wanting to meet me, when I told her I had to work and could have requested off if I had even a days notice she viciously said she would talk to a support group full of rejected half siblings about me. Anytime I think of her I get sick and panic follows, I feel as though she wants to cause us pain and this makes me not want to know her. Am I the asshole for not being ready (maybe never being ready) to bring her disruptive self into my life? She has crashed into my life like a wrecking ball.\n\nI will add that my father makes attempts to eat lunch with her from time to time and bought her children Christmas gifts and checks on her and she still makes posts about dead beat dads in reference to him.

But became pissed when I told them that I will never see their dad as my dad or them as my siblings.

Why would she? His daughters\u2019 are sensitive but she isn\u2019t? Your dad put her last and maybe rightfully so but why would she accept that?

Get a restraining order.", "You\u2019re N T A for not wanting to know her, but I gotta be honest, you probably played a big part in this thing going sideways in the first place. You say you \u201cpanicked\u201d because your *first thought* was she \u201cwanted your husband,\u201d but why assume such a thing? Do you have reason to suspect your husband of being disloyal? Is he usually open to romantic advances on social media? (If so that\u2019s a separate issue.) \n\nYour next thought is that she\u2019s coming around solely to \u201csabotage\u201d your dad. For what purpose? After that thought, you assumed her \u201cgoal is to cause you pain.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know you, why would she want to do that? Maybe she is pissed at your dad unfairly, but I\u2019m getting the sense your initial texts to her weren\u2019t exactly setting a good tone given your immediate suspicion of her trying to take your husband and/or ruin everyone\u2019s life. It sounds to me like you decided she was a villain from the jump. Is that a pattern in your life? \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t understand what relevance your mom has here, given she isn\u2019t really part of the story since she didn\u2019t birth this woman, and she didn\u2019t raise you. Are you implying she\u2019s involved in this situation somehow? \n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be a dramatic situation. Just tell her you aren\u2019t interested in a relationship and block her. Maybe if you\u2019d taken a more neutral, less \u201cpanicked\u201d stance when you first heard from her things could have gone better, but you two have *definitely* started off on the wrong foot now.

My mom came along months after he cut off contact with her married mother and told her and her husband at the time that they were a family. Even her own mother has admitted that she never reached out to him (probably because she didn't know who the dad was) so I don't understand why she continues to blame us/my dad and mom.

I have a lack of trust in people, not my husband, and have low self esteem from a previous abusive relationship that ive gone to therapy for for several years now.

I don't think he meant like they are sensitive so I'm putting you last, I think it was more like him accepting the information and asking if they could do a DNA test to confirm, but also could he be the one to tell us so we didn't totally freak put hearing it from a stranger. \n\nThank you for your input.", "I see your point, but would you not think it was weird if someone messaged your spouse asking if you are around? It was just off-putting. I have horrible anxiety anyways but my husband has never given me a reason to worry, I wasn't worried about him I was worried about her making a move on him or just really anything weird. But he called me immediately to tell me about the weird message and ask me if I knew who she was (which also triggered anxiety that she had just followed me). Just something that gets your heart pumping when they ask your spouse if you are around yet they have full access to message you themselves so I didn't think \"oh she's trying to get in touch with me\" I thought \"oh she wants to talk to my husband about something she can't with me around *insert sexual advance* or *insert you should be with me blah blah blah* idk I'm a woman with insecurities. \n\nI said I felt like she was trying to sabotage my dad because of the level of attitude she had announcing herself to me and the fact that she announced herself to him, he accepted the information calmly but said \"I need to be the one to tell my family that this is a possibility. My girls are sensitive and they need to hear this from me\" she wasted no time going behind his back and messaging my husband to tell him she's my half sister then not replying to me for 2 hours as I'm crying hysterically at work trying to figure out what is going on and if she really is. Hours later she began messaging me back accusing my dad of not wanting to raise her, accusing his relationship with my mom (that came months after my dad found out her mom was married and cut her mom off) for being why her mom didn't have the courage to reach out, and accusing my dad of trying to get out of telling us. I don't get the sense that she genuinely wanted to know me/announce herself but that she wanted to wreck my dad's chances of telling us himself. I have been civil, calm and when she said \"he probably lied about being willing to do a DNA test\" I said \"I'll do one then so we can all know.\"\n\nThe popping up in my town 3.5 hours away and asking me at 11:00 AM \"I'm in town, do you want to go to lunch and meet me or what?\" And I said \"Look I'm really sorry but I need to know these things in at least a day in advance so I can make arrangements with work or my kids. I don't think I can meet you on a 30 minute work lunch break and go back to work for the rest of the day can we please plan something else?\" I got the nastiest message about how I'm rejecting her, she drove 3.5 hours and she would be telling her support group all about how I wronged her. \n\nIt sucks that there is a 3000 character limit to these posts, but I had to give a very generalized account of things. My husband is definitely not the problem, and despite my insecurities and anxiety I tried to not take any of that out on her. She came into my life being hateful and angry at my whole family, though it is fact and admitted by her mom that my dad didn't know.", "Finally some common sense. IF this is a real post, and I don't believe for one minute that it is, OP is a serious drama queen.", "You can read the rest of the information further in the comments. My father was contacted by this woman's husband and that's how he found out she was actually married. The guy asked my dad to F off and he did. This woman proceeded to tell my half sister and her husband at the time that she was his kid. When my half sib found out this wasn't true, her mom named another man she cheated on her husband with and he also was not the father. The man who she thought was her dad (and he thought he was her dad too) told her that her mom had cheated on him with several men before she was born. \n\nMy husband hasn't done anything, I have severe anxiety and was worried when she reached out to him asking if I was around and didn't consider the possibility that she was trying to get in touch with me (anxiety thought omg this stranger wants to talk to my husband without me around) until I found out who she was.\n\nHer mother confirmed to her that she never reached out to tell my dad \"hey I'm pregnant, could be yours or several other dudes but I'm just gonna let my husband think it's his baby\". \n\nMy dad was hurt to find out the woman he was dating was married. He's not a bad guy, when the man called him my dad told him the truth that she told him she was long divorced and single and he would cut contact with her. \n\nI don't know how my dad could have put \"HIS\" spin on it, when he literally did not know she existed and his story lines up with her own mom's story. They lived in a whole other county and my half sister and the first husband literally thought they were biological. I don't understand what you thought would have been the right thing to do, continue to contact a married woman just to check and see if she was pregnant? After the husband respectfully made himself known and asked my dad to step away? To which he did out of respect for their marriage....that he didn't know about? The mom didn't reach out because she didn't even know which man could be the dad.", "And I'm 100% sure he wanted to be the one to tell my little sister and I because of the extensive mental health history we both have. My little sister is literally in therapy over this and the way she found out. Which he told my half sibling that this news would have to be broken to us gently to keep us from both having distressing panic attacks over such unexpected news. She agreed to let him tell us then in a fit of rage denied him that opportunity and I honestly think it was so his family (my sister and I) would be as upset as she was with her mom.", "You\u2019re getting down voted because you\u2019re supposed to tell her she\u2019s in grave peril and to go to the police lol.

No nuance or compassion allowed whatsoever. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous to me because I actually *lived it* and I bet the downvoters haven\u2019t.

His perspective on him is obviously different than mine. We\u2019ve all made peace with the past, and I\u2019m always happy to see him and my dad hang out these days. But I\u2019m not a very jealous person tbh and my bro is laid back (like me) so it\u2019s all good (even if I was somewhere embarrassed when this all came out years ago. I got over it.) \n\nPs: Search \u201caffair baby wants a relationship\u201d in here. It\u2019s a great karma-booster, I guess. This sub eats it up.", "Yes, she knows all of that. She has also bore witness to her mom's many many boyfriends amd husbands and cheating through the years and when the man she thought was her dad also found out (at the same time) that she wasn't his he told her that her mom had cheated on him with multiple guys during that time (they aren't married anymore but he kept in touch with her thinking she was his daughter of course).", "Be thankful she's shown her true nature from the start!", "Oh I COMPLETELY understand. My life is constant dodging and weaving to avoid anxiety attacks.", "With your trust issues I think you can understand her trust issues in a way. Like her own mother lied to her for years. Even if she didn\u2019t felt like him putting her last why would she think your dad would tell about her to his sensitive girls? So his family dynamics might shatter? Her mom hide her father\u2019s identity (even possibilities) from her for years to live a peaceful life. Why would her dad be different? That\u2019s how she sees it.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome. I hope it\u2019s helpful to you and I just wanna say that if I were you at least I would put distance between me and her until she\u2019s stable. Because right now she\u2019s like a train without any brakes. Your dad might be only one who can help her if he\u2019s sincere.", "You can simply and firmly tell her \u201cno thanks,\u201d then block her. Don\u2019t stress yourself worrying about her motives, you\u2019re an adult and she can\u2019t *force* a relationship. If she\u2019s got resentments against your dad? He\u2019s a grown adult who can deal with it. That\u2019s between them. \n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s none of your business if he chooses to connect with her (as long as he respects your choice to be left out of it, that is). Same goes for your sister. I would say that you have a right to be pissed if your husband continues to engage with her, however. Hopefully he won\u2019t, it really sounds like he\u2019s been open and supportive so far.", "Lol glad my life is so entertaining to you that you think it is fake.", "I think we were supposed to say: \u201cRUN this woman is crazy!!! OMG OMG! This is obviously a real life single white female you don\u2019t owe her shit, you\u2019re in danger!!! Be mean af and panic!!!! Burn the witch!!!\n\nThat gets the upvotes on these threads lol. IDGAF.", "Did your dad get a DNA test or not? If she's not related then all of you can stop engaging with her. NTA", "Thank you for the advice. And no, hubby hasn't talked to her since that day. She hasn't tried to talk to him either. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she reached out to him to use him as a buffer vs the alternative that she reached out to him to stir the pot even further. And form of anxiety about her messaging him was before I knew what it was about, and he has actually blocked her because of the way that she blew up on me and my family and wants nothing to do with that \"ticking time bomb\" and really doesn't want me to meet her after witnessing how she has treated all of us. (My husband is really close with my dad). He really has been supportive through this whole thing. And we both have voiced our support to my dad, and let him know that despite her actions we understand if having a relationship with her is something that he feels he needs to do.", "Yes, he and I both completed one that confirmed that she is his daughter/my half sister.", "You\u2019re welcome. I would also like to (gently) remind you that not everyone who contacts you out of the blue necessarily means you harm. Last summer a lady got ahold of us randomly, and yes, I was a bit taken aback initially, but it turned out she had found a long lost purse and wanted to return it. For no reason except the goodness of her heart. Most people don\u2019t have malicious motives\u2014if you\u2019re open (but cautious obviously) sometimes you get *good* surprises. Just a thought.", "That sucks. She's bullying your dad so much over something he didn't even know...", "You're right, I'm defensive to a fault (from bad past experiences) but it is something that I do work on. I can't say this experience has helped that initiative but I'm always trying to be less suspicious. I mostly internalize it and don't treat people as though they are out to get me, more of a self esteem issue but composed on the outside. It got worse for me after a past abusive relationship (PTSD diagnosis from that) and having kids. Another reason my dad wanted to be the one to break the half sister thing to me, he knows how I handle these things.", "Well, you\u2019ve responded really well to criticism, so that tells me good things about your character. It seems you want to have a positive outlook, even if it hasn\u2019t been easy. Good for you, keep at it, don\u2019t let the negativity of the past hold you back\u2014and I believe better things will indeed come your way.", "Damn lol people are really down voting a compliment and good wishes. Good old bitter Reddit."]}
