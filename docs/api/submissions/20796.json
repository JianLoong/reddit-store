Yeah, having been there with undiagnosed ADHD that was also causing depression and anxiety, I know what it\u2019s like to \u201cchill\u201d at home and hate that you can\u2019t seem to get anything done. \n\nI also had a friend who really struggled with housework and it almost ended her marriage until she was able to recognize and talk to her husband about the emotional trigger she had due to misogyny in her family of origin which caused an emotional block for her whenever her husband (who is not at all sexist) wanted to talk about chore division etc. \n\nSo yeah, hopefully for OP and wife it\u2019s a relatively easy conversation and place for strengthening their relationship but if it\u2019s more complicated, there can be a lot more at play than just energy/lazy or lack of consideration.", "That's the point here though, isn't it?\n\nIt very much depends on what housework is being done, to what standard.\n\nBecause housework could be anything from a few hours a week to few a day - that's a BIG difference! So I'm not sure we have enough info.\n\nI just see a lot of trends were housework is often under estimated on how much physical and mental effort it is, and how long it takes.\n\nSo I'd say more info needed, but the key thing to me is having an honest chat and working out what all the adults in the household consider fair, including what standard is expected.\n\nAll the things you mentioned about meal prep and planning, and making a trip out to get additionals all adds up.", "I don\u2019t make elaborate meals during the week but that\u2019s still an hour a day of prep/cook/clean the kitchen after.

And beyond all else, we don\u2019t know what the actual demands and expectations are for the house, which is why I\u2019m so stuck on the number of hours spent. If OP expects every room in the house cleaned every day, all windows, all ceilings and corners, swept, swiffered, vacuumed and mopped, laundry done every day, etc then he is the AH because that\u2019s unreasonable and he should expect to contribute if that\u2019s what he wants done around the house", "Sure, but that doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s only 60% of your weekly chores.
