OP has a full time job and appears to be managing all financial aspects. The wife should be picking up the lion\u2019s share of housework, if not all. That is how a healthy relationship operates. Once she recommences work, it should go back to a more even split. \n\nHe is NTA.", "One thing I've learned from reddit is that some people put waaaaaaaaay too much work into keeping their house flawlessly clean and hold themselves and their partners to insane standards. \n\nThese psychos actually vacuum and mop their floors every day, and think that's normal.", "Aww thanks! Yeah, having been there with undiagnosed ADHD that was also causing depression and anxiety, I know what it\u2019s like to \u201cchill\u201d at home and hate that you can\u2019t seem to get anything done. \n\nI also had a friend who really struggled with housework and it almost ended her marriage until she was able to recognize and talk to her husband about the emotional trigger she had due to misogyny in her family of origin which caused an emotional block for her whenever her husband (who is not at all sexist) wanted to talk about chore division etc. \n\nSo yeah, hopefully for OP and wife it\u2019s a relatively easy conversation and place for strengthening their relationship but if it\u2019s more complicated, there can be a lot more at play than just energy/lazy or lack of consideration.", "That's the point here though, isn't it?\n\nIt very much depends on what housework is being done, to what standard.\n\nBecause housework could be anything from a few hours a week to few a day - that's a BIG difference! So I'm not sure we have enough info.\n\nI just see a lot of trends were housework is often under estimated on how much physical and mental effort it is, and how long it takes.\n\nSo I'd say more info needed, but the key thing to me is having an honest chat and working out what all the adults in the household consider fair, including what standard is expected.\n\nAll the things you mentioned about meal prep and planning, and making a trip out to get additionals all adds up.", "I don\u2019t make elaborate meals during the week but that\u2019s still an hour a day of prep/cook/clean the kitchen after. I also spend 30 min-1 hour cleaning everyday - each room gets deep cleaned once a week plus daily vacuuming and general tidying up. Then add 4ish loads of laundry per week, plus 1-2x a week grocery shopping. So yeah, 2+ hours a day is totally possible.", "laundry, cooking, mopping and sweeping, cleaning in general, up keep, etc", "I dunno, I shop, cook and handle the dishwasher.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is about an hour a day cooking, plus 30 mins for cleanup and at least 2 hours a week shopping, so that is like 12.5 hours a week.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy partner cleans, takes care of the cats laundry etc.  She does about as much as I do.", "Yes but exactly how deeply are you cleaning each time? Are you always doing a deep clean with bleach and scrubbing, getting into corners, or are you for the most part just doing a light sweep and something like a Swiffer, light dusting/wiping off counters, basic dishes everyday something like that?\n\nI'm not automatically saying that OP's wife is doing a deep clean of every room everyday, or one room everyday, but IF She is that definitely could add extra time.", "Laundry water heated in a cauldron with a wood fire. His 40% is chopping all the wood and hauling from the well.", "I do have a dog, I include the cleaning up poop and feeding - I didnt add in the daily walks because I enjoy those - or the time i spend going through her training routine because she has to unlearn some bad habits.", "I\u2019m not sure my point is coming across. I do not understand how there is 5 hours of housework every single day for two people with no children. It makes no sense to me and so I\u2019m having trouble even making a judgement.", "I too have a two person household with two animals and no kids. There is no way that we have 20 hours of housework to do weekly", "That\u2019s just how you would manage the relationship. That doesn\u2019t make it some absolute. We don\u2019t know how much time OPs wife spends looking for work. We don\u2019t know OPs wife mental or physical health condition. And beyond all else, we don\u2019t know what the actual demands and expectations are for the house, which is why I\u2019m so stuck on the number of hours spent. If OP expects every room in the house cleaned every day, all windows, all ceilings and corners, swept, swiffered, vacuumed and mopped, laundry done every day, etc then he is the AH because that\u2019s unreasonable and he should expect to contribute if that\u2019s what he wants done around the house", "Sure, but that doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s only 60% of your weekly chores. I would also say you spend more time than the average childless couple cooking, cleaning and maintaining your home", "Laundry every day? Mopping and sweeping every day? (If so it shouldn\u2019t take very long). And if the partner is doing all of this over the course of 2-3 hours every day, what is being left for him?", "I mean sure, doing things that are unreasonable means it takes longer. But I think he\u2019d complain she\u2019s bleaching the home daily, not being lazy.", "ooooo fancy pants over there with heated water for washing clothes.\n\nHere was me picturing scrubbing the clothes in a stream", "I understand. You know, I wonder if they count laundry as 2.5 hours, even though it\u2019s a passive activity if you have the machines in your house. Maybe that\u2019s why their housework sounds excessive.", "Yeah, I had 7 hours weekly. But we had a 400 sq ft apartment, so no outdoor work/not responsible for actually fixing things. I had cooking down to 1 hour of cooking and 30 minutes of errands a week, and was pretty medium with my standards on kitchen/bathroom cleaning. My ex also created about 5 items of laundry a week lol \n\nSo cooking something different most days, having outdoor work, a non-WFH amount of laundry, I can see it getting close to that. Growing up my mom easily spent 2 hours a day just cooking and doing the dishes from it (which would\u2019ve been the same if the amount of food being cooked was 33% less).", "I agree that we don\u2019t have all the information, however based on the information provided the husband is NTA. We could all surmise about the reasons behind any of these judgements, but on face value the wife should be stepping up more. Personally, if I didn\u2019t work, had no childcare obligations, my mental health was fine and no other demands, then I would be contributing to my marriage in this way. \n\nAnd if my husband was temporarily out of work, and I the breadwinner, I would expect him to do the exact same. \n\nBut I do agree that 2-3 hours per day seems pretty excessive for a small household with no children.", "Maybe he does the yard work and the trash and considers that 40% \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "my mother does laundry every day, sweeps and mops everyday, when it comes to cleaning there\u2019s always something to do. but my mother also has 4 kids and dogs", "That\u2019s lazy talk, letting a stream rinse the clothes for you.", "Maybe that\u2019s the case, but it just begs the question what details OP left out", "That I could totally see", "4 kids certainly changes the equation, OP does not have kids"]}
