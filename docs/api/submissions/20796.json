She does 2-3 per DAY and that\u2019s only 60%?", "NTA - I would say if she was looking for jobs and going to interviews then to take this into account as applications and prep work can take effort/time. But outside of this then I would say broach the subject as its unfair that she has a 3 hour day whereas you have 8 + whatever chores you do.", "NTA, assuming there isn\u2019t something else taking up her time like childcare, she should be doing almost, if not all of, the chores.", "NTA. Yea she should definitely pick up most of the household chores if she doesnt have any other responsibilities. Since you are providing financially for the two of you then she should definitely be picking up like 90% of the household chores, at least, so that when you do get off work you two can spend time together. If yall have kids its a little different but honestly not much", "NTA though I have to wonder why 2 to 3 hours a day is not enough to get everything done?", "NTA. You put in your hours at work and she should, too. You should be able to come home to relax, hang out, and unwind; you shouldn\u2019t be coming home to more work when she\u2019s had plenty of time to get it all done.", "NTA\n\nI'm retired and my wife still works.\n\nI clean, cook, shop, take care of the animals, yardwork, dishes, bills, finances.\n\nProbably averages 2-3 hours a day.\n\nShe does laundry because she enjoys it and gardens for enjoyment.\n\nShe helps with some of the other stuff when she's off and feels like it \n\nI'd say 90/10.\n\nIncluding prep and commute shes working 9-11 hrs a day five days a week.\n\nI have no expectations that she do any chores when she gets home.", "NTA. Assuming 'hangs out' doesn't mean 'applying for jobs 6 hours a day' or they have an illness that makes 3 hours of chores a full days energy, its fair that you would both put an equal amount of effort into running the household. Otherwise the person not working has a ton of leisure time and the person working has very little.", "depends was that part of the deal when you both decided she wouldn't work? why isn't she working.", "NTA - you work full-time and help with the chores, you do your part, and that's all anyone sane can ask of you. On top of that, the arrangement of her not working and you being the breadwinner needs some clarification between you. From what I can read, she doesn't seem involved in job-hunting or studying full-time, so, based on the information I can get from the OP, she isn't pulling her weight.\n\nThere are good and bad ways to face this discussion with your partner. Being salty and demanding her to do more is, by definition, the wrong way. A relationship is a mutual agreement between two parties; you must find common ground, or it will risk souring what you have.\n\nI can't help you with how you can ask it nicely because I don't know your partner and what can trigger an adverse reaction from her. You should discuss how working full-time and doing 40% of the chores wears you down. Don't cast any judgment on what she does, talk openly about how you feel, and you can hope she's reasonable and understand her behaviour aggravates your situation. If she doesn't, you will have a red flag in a relationship, and I suggest counselling.", "Relationships are supposed to be team work. When the balance is out of wack, it can breed resentment by the person carrying the heavier load.\n\n\nIf she is not working, it's completely fair that she does the majority of the work at home, incl maintenance, chores and possibly meal prep.\n\n\nSitting on your arse being provided for by your partner and contributing nothing (or very little) in return is unfair so NTA.", "NTA.  Your spouse should be doing most of the chores if not all.", "NTA. I don't think that's unreasonable if you're working \n\n>8-10 hours a day during the week and occasionally a few hours on the weekend\n\nand she's at home all day.", "NTA\n\nWhat does she even do all day?", "NTA\n\nJust because she doesn't have to 'go' to work, doesn't mean she should be hanging out most of her day. I hate to sound all \"60's\", but she should be doing ALL the housework, and cooking all the meals. This is HER job. You go to work 8-10 hours a day, and she is fortunate enough to not have to work a 9-5 job. The least she can do is the housework/cooking, that way you two can enjoy each other's company at the end of the day, and relax together.", "NTA. If I was a stay-at-home, I'd be doing *everything*. And it still wouldn't amount to an 8 hr shift.", "INFO: are you paying everything for both of you (what would make her a SAHGF) or is she paying her share from her savings. \n\nIf you are earning the money for both of you, she can be expected to do 100% of the chores. You didn't mention kids so its a 2 person household. She can do 100% of the chores in like 2-3 h a day in average (more like 1h a day maybe 2 if she also cooks more than one meal for you two) and maybe 5-6h once every two weeks to deep clean) and still has a lot of free time (in opposit to you).", "Info: what chores are there that need to be done?  How big is your home?  How many animals do you own?  How many young children do you have?\n\nIf you have no kids and no pets YTA.  2-3 hours of chores a day is an insane amount of housework unless there's some factor you're not mentioning to explain it.  \n\nHousehold chores: Cleaning 2-4 hours a week depending on the size of your home (this means vacuuming, dusting, cleaning kitchen and bathrooms, wiping down surfaces, changing bedclothes).  Laundry for two people 2 hours (time in the machine obviously not counted), mostly related to ironing and folding.  Cooking dinner fresh every day 7 hours a week, includes doing the dishes.  Grocery shopping up to 2 hours a week if going to the store, 15 minutes if ordering for home delivery (not counting incidental purchases, e.g. extra milk).  Even assuming you have a huge home, she cooks every night for you and carefully hand picks the best produce for you she's just topping out at 15 hours a week.  That she manages to find 21 hours worth of stuff I don't know.  What the hell you're doing the other 18 hours I have no idea.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
