Second, you did the right thing by talking to them about it to check what they wanted to do. And you're right, they definitely need to take things slow. Their mother needs to build trust. After abandoning them for so long, they need for her presence to be stable if they're going to have her in their lives again.", "NTA.  If I'm doing the math right, the boys were three when she left.  They may not even have memories of her.  Giving birth does not mean that kids will automatically be emotionally connected to you.  That comes with the hard work of being in their lives day after day and doing the parenting thing.  Mom left.

Best thing you can do is to give them her phone number and tell them and her that they call her if and when they want to without you interfering", "NTA.  If she wants to connect with them, she could start by writing each of them and apology and giving the letters to you.  You could read them to make sure they were not inappropriate.  Then you could give them to each kid and they could decide if they want to read them, and if they do, whether they ever want to see her.

But watch out if she takes you to court. Your boys are old enough to tell the judge what they want and that will not be what her family and her want to hear. If they keep harassing you, file a police report. With that you can prove to a judge that you need an order of protection. From there that may mean they can't contact you and should they, you can have them arrested for ignoring the order.", "NTA.

When my brother was around 14 or 15 they wanted to meet him. His dad tried forcing a relationship for a little bit. Like if he wanted to give my brother extra money aside from the Cs I would have to take my brother to meet him somewhere. His dad was upset bc my brother was not interested in a relationship like that for a while.

She abandoned her sons no less than two times to deal with or embrace drugs, and only came back at her own convenience. Her sons weren't \"poisoned\" against her, they were burned **by** her and now they have a once bitten twice shy approach to her. That's her own doing.\n\nPlus, you don't exactly oppose her on this. You inquired with your sons and supported their choice whilst saying it wasn't necessarily reason for her to give up hope.\n\n>I ended it with she needs to prove to them that she can be a mother but it\u2019s going to be a very slow process.\n\nThis was on the money.

Block her and her family on your phone.   It's inappropriate for them to be texting you about this matter.   Her family is not supporting the boys and likely rarely sees the boys.   If the grandparents are active participants in the boy's lives then you can meet for coffee with them while they are at a friend's place or something and you can advise them that the boys are the ones who made the decision - not you.

Everyone who is pushing this relationship is doing it for her sake, not the best interest of your kids.", "She's already showing that she's not willing to do what's best for them, she wants what *she* wants, regardless of their wellbeing. These boys are honestly better off keeping her at arms length.", "Yup. And since Ex has only been around for 2 months, how do you even know that she's a responsible adult now, that she's fully sober, able to hold a job for long term, independently take care of herself, is trustworthy, a good person, etc etc. OP is right EX needs to prove herself and this needs to happen very slowly. NTA", "Exactly. It\u2019s still all about her. She clearly cares nothing for them.", "They were three when we split up. I had custody while she tried to get herself clean. We had two years of visits and days out when we could. The last time they saw her was the day before their fifth birthday when she promised them she will be there for their party. She never turned up and we never heard anything more from her until now", "Exactly. The fact that OP asked the kids and they said no speaks volumes of the good parent he is. Do NOT let her see them, they have been through enough because of her and she may cause them further trauma (just look at her track record). NTA", ">Tell her flying monkeys to go eat a banana\n\nLove the Wizard of Oz reference", "Exactly. It\u2019s still all about her. She clearly cares nothing for them. I\u2019d bet money that she\u2019s in a relationship now and has spun OP to look like an abusive ex trying to keep the kids from her so she can look like a saint with whoever she\u2019s with now. OP is a fantastic dad who is listening to the kids and even still isn\u2019t writing this whole thing off. He\u2019s keeping it open for the kiddos sakes!", "It\u2019s not a lack of empathy. Look, long term substance use affects the brain significantly- and even if she is clean, it takes the brain time to catch up and be able to make good decisions.", "Radio silence is ok, but I\u2019d personally go with a lawsuit for 10 years of back pay on child support.", "What she did was terrible, but name calling is not okay. Addiction is a monster that doesn\u2019t discriminate- and healing from it is a struggle. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy.", "That's perfect.  Well said.", "was looking for this comment. it takes a lot to raise one alone but THREE! Obviously i would have felt some type of way too if i had to raise three alone and the other parent all of a sudden wants to come \nsqueezing back i tho their lives.", "No I got a divorce while she was missing. We did file a missing persons report but they told us that she had left the state willingly. Her family refused to legally declare her dead. She doesn\u2019t have any rights because I was given sole custody as she was missing", "Tell her she needs to pay back child support for all those years first.", "Oooh, five year olds.  I bet they remember the pain and confusion of their mother disappearing.  Good on you for standing up for your kids.", "It is a lack of empathy. The cause for it may or may not be drugs, but she still has no empathy or regard for her children.", "You\u2019re on to something there.", "\u2018deadbeat\u2019 is hardly a insult and is absolutely deserving given the circumstances.", "Deadbeat is actually a legal term in this case as a parent who doesn\u2019t pay child support.", "Addiction isn't making her disregard OP's children wishes now not to want to see her and only still caring about what she wants.", "Well, NTA, then.  Did she say where she had been all this time or why she came back?", "Guarantee if she got hit with a bill for ten years worth of child support for three kids, they wouldn\u2019t see her for another ten years.", "It took a few years for them to stop asking where she was. Thankfully they don\u2019t remember what she put them through up to age three", "You obviously don\u2019t understand what addiction and long term substance use does to the brain. It takes a very long time for the brain ( I.e critical thinking skills) to heal from the trauma", "No she wouldn\u2019t tell me.", "I'm so sorry your family had to go through that.", "Not remembering specific events doesn't mean they don't have lasting effects from it, as I'm sure OP knows. That kind of stuff can take a lifetime to heal from. I'm a foster parent, and I've had preschoolers down to infants that have expressed grief and loss. There's no escaping the trauma world abandonment.\n\nIf the boys ever decide to get to know her at any age, I'd recommend having them see a therapist at the same time & possibly having mediated visits with mom to help them process any feelings or memories that arise. Until they're 18, I'd keep a tight lid on contact.", "You are doing the right thing protecting them", "Boo hoo, she fucked her own mind up and wants to be coddled now, she\u2019s an adult. She needs to face her own reality.", "> Did she say where she had been all this time or why she came back?\n\nThe cynical side of me thinks she needs a spare kidney or liver lobe from a decade of substance abuse", "Addiction is a disease. Have some empathy for the suffering", "This woman decided drugs were more important than her kids and husband, no sympathy will be found here.", "Addiction is a disease of the stupid. My mom has MS, a non preventable and genetic condition, I know suffering.", "Wow. Just wow. Addiction does not discriminate. Some of the most intelligent  and amazing people I know have been victims of addiction. There a many quite famous people who are in recovery. What a really ignorant statement you just made", ">Some of the most intelligent and amazing people I know have been victims of addiction. \n\nYou need to meet more people and have higher standards.", "I\u2019m sorry you live in meth hell?", "I agree. My mother was a very intelligent and educated woman. My narcissist father put her through hell and she started drinking. Addiction is definitely not a desease of the stupid. \nMy mother loved us dearly and was a good mother through my childhood, but later, when I was a teen, she neglected us because of alcohol. I don't think it was her DECISION to drink her brain out every evening. It's not a decision.\n\nAddicted people are ill, not evil. And yet, I would not give OP's ex wife access to the kids, because they need protection from the person that abandoned them.\n\nEdit: typo", "Ha! That's what I was thinking too.", "No im actually a normal person who has I don\u2019t know not lived in a goddamn bubble", "NTA.\n\nThe children are plenty old enough to decide for themselves if they want to meet their estranged mother. If they say no, then you need to respect that. End of story.", "NTA! \u201cYou\u2019ve poisoned them against me!\u201d. Honey, you did that all on your own.", "NTA.\n\nIf it was me, I may have been initially giving her the benefit of the doubt. But seeing that her first reaction to not immediately getting what she wants is to explode in anger, shows she probably hasn't improved as a person. It seems more likely that she just wants to feel like she isn't a terrible mother, rather than actually be a good mother.", "Has her family had any contact with them over the years? And what do they want you to do for the kids to be in her presence? NTA."]}
