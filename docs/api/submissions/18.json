Second, you did the right thing by talking to them about it to check what they wanted to do. And you're right, they definitely need to take things slow. Their mother needs to build trust. After abandoning them for so long, they need for her presence to be stable if they're going to have her in their lives again.", "NTA.  If I'm doing the math right, the boys were three when she left.  They may not even have memories of her.  Giving birth does not mean that kids will automatically be emotionally connected to you.  That comes with the hard work of being in their lives day after day and doing the parenting thing.  Mom left.  She's going to have to earn their company now.", "NTA\n\nThe teenage kids say they don't want to see her. They can decide that at 15.

When I was a kid, CPS and therapists forced me to have contact to my mother and it lead to one wound after another. Best thing you can do is to give them her phone number and tell them and her that they call her if and when they want to without you interfering", "NTA.  If she wants to connect with them, she could start by writing each of them and apology and giving the letters to you.  You could read them to make sure they were not inappropriate.  Then you could give them to each kid and they could decide if they want to read them, and if they do, whether they ever want to see her.

But watch out if she takes you to court. Your boys are old enough to tell the judge what they want and that will not be what her family and her want to hear. If they keep harassing you, file a police report. With that you can prove to a judge that you need an order of protection. From there that may mean they can't contact you and should they, you can have them arrested for ignoring the order.", "NTA.

And, he hadn't seen my brother since he was an infant.But, my brothers dad was and is raising his biological daughter and an adopted daughter. When my brother was around 14 or 15 they wanted to meet him. His dad tried forcing a relationship for a little bit. Like if he wanted to give my brother extra money aside from the Cs I would have to take my brother to meet him somewhere. His dad was upset bc my brother was not interested in a relationship like that for a while.

She abandoned her sons no less than two times to deal with or embrace drugs, and only came back at her own convenience. Her sons weren't \"poisoned\" against her, they were burned **by** her and now they have a once bitten twice shy approach to her. That's her own doing.\n\nPlus, you don't exactly oppose her on this. You inquired with your sons and supported their choice whilst saying it wasn't necessarily reason for her to give up hope.\n\n>I ended it with she needs to prove to them that she can be a mother but it\u2019s going to be a very slow process.\n\nThis was on the money.

Block her and her family on your phone.   It's inappropriate for them to be texting you about this matter.   Her family is not supporting the boys and likely rarely sees the boys.   If the grandparents are active participants in the boy's lives then you can meet for coffee with them while they are at a friend's place or something and you can advise them that the boys are the ones who made the decision - not you.

I hadn't seen or heard from him in 5 years or so until the drinking and driving accident (his drinking, his driving) that almost took his life.  We went to the hospital to say goodbye and I realized I cared more for the stranger next door because my father had chosen to abandon me, chosen that loving me wasn't a priority in his life.\n\nHe survived and spent the last 17 years of his life as a quadriplegic.  He got his act together and petitioned for visitation so we could see him every other weekend and 6 weeks in the summer.  We had to go, so from 9 until 13 I spent a ton of time with someone I just hated trying to win my affection. There are a few good memories, but mostly I remember how much I didn't want to be there.\n\nAt 13, we attended a family reunion where he couldn't go on the train ride with everyone else and I didn't want to, so we ended up talking and things got deep.  I yelled at him for all the years of hurt... and he just sat there took it, listening to me.  From that point, we had a relationship that may not have been traditional father-daughter, but when he eventually died, I felt loss.\n\nYour ex has not filed for visitation and so you aren't legally obligated to make your sons visit her.

He got prosecuted for failure to pay child support for 8ish years and reached out saying he wanted to meet our son and be part of his life. (Imo an attempt to look better for court and receive leniency.) I have never said bad things about his father and didn't allow anyone else to either. I told my son that his dad wasn't a bad person but had a very difficult childhood and was very damaged because of it so he didn't make a lot of good choices. I tried to make sure he knew that it wasn't him or anything he did that caused his dad to leave. Other than that I figured time would allow my son to make his own mind up about what he feels about his dad. So when his dad reached out I didn't want to actually tell my son because his dad had a bad habit of not showing up when he says he's going to. So I felt out my son about \"hypothetical situation\" would you want to ever meet with your dad and how would you feel if you just saw him once and then he disappeared again? He said he just wanted to see him and like see what he looked like and find out a bit about what he's like, just so he knows, but that he was fine with how our life was and didn't really care if it was just one thing. Basically wanted to take care of his curiosity about the guy and that's it. \n\nSo we set up a time to meet at a park and didn't tell my then 9 yo son about it having anything to do with his dad, just that we're going to a new park. Only when I saw his dad actually show up did I tell my son. We did a couple more visits like this and then he got a deferred prosecution agreement and my son started asking to see where he lived which he made excuses not to be able to do. (It was weird and turns out he had brought a girlfriend with him that he didn't want to tell me about for some reason and definitely didn't want us to meet her and talk to her about the kid he'd been lying to her about exisisting.) Then we never heard from him again and my son is currently 22 yo. \n\nBut if my son had not wanted to meet his dad the answer would have been no. Hard stop. At 9 yo.
