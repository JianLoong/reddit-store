A restrictive approach to sugar also leads to children overeating, and having a restrict (diet) eating in excess of what they are hungry for when they do get access (binge eating)   \nMeaning shame & guilt is associated with these foods (disordered emotional eating).\n\n  \nChildren need practice with eating these foods, and Grandma is likely to still want to give them as she wants her time with the child to be special & fun. Sweet treats in her mind, are an affordable way to provide that. She may end up agreeing to your rules OP doing it anyway, and just lying to you about it.\n\n  \nHow often does she babysit? If its only every so often, is it really worth sacrificing your child's relationship with their grandparent & your access to free child care? Just accept your child will have a few sweets with Grandma, show her some info on cavities & make an agreement child will always drink water after having the sweets, eat other foods alongside them, and brush afterwards.", "FYI if he has the ability to get sugar and screen time on a daily basis if he's good, you are nowhere near a sugar and screen free household lol", "ESH.

But I would explain to your son that when grandma babysits, these are special days and the star system doesn\u2019t work. Only you (the parents) use it with him. So he doesn\u2019t refer to those days to compare. \n\nBut you are also TA, although probably full of good intention, because of the treat you have chosen to give him. Rewarding good behaviours in a child with sweets and screen time is the best idea if you want to create a dependency. When you give him sweets because he has enough star, you tell him that sweets are a special good, that you eat when you are good/feel good and that fruit, yogourt and other non-sweets are of less value, that they are the \u00ab\u00a0bad\u00a0\u00bb food. That creates a distorted relationship with food. \n\nSame thing for screen time. If he only has access to screen time when he is \u00ab\u00a0good\u00a0\u00bb, then  he\u2019ll see his iPad as a more special game than all his other toys and activities. You won\u2019t always be able to regulate his screen time and right now you are creating a belief that the iPad is the best toy.

The difference is that my mom sees the kids once or twice a year (we love 1200 miles away) while my spouse's mom saw them multiple times a week (they picked up my kids from school a few days a week for us but we stopped that about a year ago when my father in law got cancer).", "Not even 18, by time they enter their teens, kids learn how to sneak things.", "Lmao before that if they are ever allowed anywhere without their parents. Besides that though what does she mean about natural consequences?", "Go ahead and explain why sticker charts are unhealthy.", "He\u2019s 5. We won\u2019t keep this up when he\u2019s older. This is just a way to instil good habits and a routine early.", "Well the behaviour chart is working to motivate him to brush his teeth. Regardless of cavity associations, a lot of sugar is still not a good thing.", "Everyday he has the choice between screen time and sweets as a reward and so far he\u2019s accepted it. He doesn\u2019t ever request it outside of those times.", "We\u2019ve come across his research before and we mostly agree. We don\u2019t punish negative behaviour and we only reinforce positive behaviour. Also the behaviours we work on are very specific things that don\u2019t require that intrinsic motivation, they require routine. Things like brushing your teeth, sleeping on time, you do them because you have to. It\u2019s important to develop a routine for them.\n\nWe don\u2019t use it for behaviours that do require intrinsic motivation. Instead we allow natural positive consequences from those behaviours.", "The value of a good job should be intrinsic, not extrinsic.", "And food as a reward is such a shitty thing.", "This is such a weird post - nobody is a no sugar household.   \n\nNo honey, no bbq sauce, no sweet corn.   No fruit juices, no milk and no vegetable juices.  No apples, or oranges or grapes.  \n\nI understand you\u2019re trying to virtue signal, but the extremes should be avoided.  Kids can earn screen time or earn a sugary snack in a healthy way", "Same. \n\nA \u2018no sugar household\u2019 is a no sugar household. It confused me as well.", "We haven\u2019t noticed impulsive behaviour around them. We don\u2019t restrict holidays. Christmas and Halloween he barely reached for the sweets.", "Can confirm! I\u2019m 27 and regularly go through phases where I want all the brown soda or sweets. I was not allowed brown soda (really any but especially brown) whatsoever growing up. Same with snacks, sweets, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with binge eating and bulimia since I was 14.(babysitting money and sneaking soda/snacks from the vending machine at school)", "That\u2019s a good point we debated about it but since we don\u2019t restrict sweets on Halloween and Christmas we figured it\u2019s best to create that understanding of moderation.", "Play. Books, songs, walks to the parks.", "She said she did but he didn\u2019t want to. Which is exactly the point of the behaviour chart. She thinks him not tantruming by escaping a demand is a positive thing.", "Good point. Idk because she asks to see him.", "Not what I said. It\u2019s a constant pattern hence why when we introduced the behaviour chart we explained it to her and she agreed to it.", "Me too. Why can they only spoil with sugar and screen time? My grandmother was extra special to us because she told us fun scary bedtime stories and sang songs to us only she knew.\n\nI much rather have MIL engage him in those ways. There are no memories being build is she just had a him an iPad.", "I\u2019ve told her this. He loves books, singing songs, the park, his swing in the garden. Even if she needs a break she could just tell him to go play or she could sit while he colours or draws.", "This! My most precious memories of my grandmother where her stories and songs. She would tell us the best bed time stories. My mother would pretend to disprove because the stories were scary.", "Behaviour charts are also used as a tool to aid kids with impulse control disorders and oppositional defiant disorder...", "We aren't talking about school.  We are talking about home.   I agree food as a reward is a bad idea, but just about every home does that, with or without a chart.  There isn't anything wrong with giving a kid stars on a chart for making their bed, or taking out the trash.  That is what we are talking about here.  \n\nYes, the OP gives them sweets and screen time if they earn enough stars.", "The thing is they aren\u2019t depriving him, he just has to earn them.", "Actually, I\u2019ve got a 17 year old, and my wife used to train foster parents on how to handle difficult kids. This is exactly what they did, and it\u2019s how we worked with our son. The rewards were different, but the system was the same.", "I brush my teeth and have always practiced great oral hygiene. My teeth are weak and I'm prone to cavities despite all of that.\nMy husband couldn't give two craps about his oral hygiene and his teeth are better than mine. I hate that about him. Genetics definitely play into it.", "Yes. Hypoplasia (thin enamel) is a pretty common congenital condition that can lead to early cavity even with good oral hygiene and little sugar.", "I brushed my teeth twice a week for 8-10 years because I was struggling with severe depression and anxiety and never had the motivation (a.k.a. energy) to do so. It was too mentally taxing. (It wasn't until I got on an anti-anxiety/depression medication that I was able to start doing twice a day without dying, and 9 months later, I'm still not perfect because it's such an old habit.) \n\nGuess who didn't get any cavities until about two years ago? I now have two tiny ones. Genetics for the win!\n\nI'm still ashamed to think about it, let alone talk about it, but also... mental health is real, and maybe sharing my experience will help someone.", "My dentist admitted it\u2019s like 95% genetics and 5% oral hygiene.", "Yeah, my family all had very weak enamel and had so many fillings even with good brushing routine. Frustrating when it\u2019s out of your own hands.", "my daughter has this issue, I forgot the medical term for it but there is something in her saliva that makes it extremely easy for her to get cavities.", "Ouch...", "My grandfather died in 1937 without a single cavity. That\u2019s just genetics.", "Yeah, admitting here that my oral care was not stellar for many years and I have zero fillings or missing teeth, so can't blame the sugar and lack of mouthwash for everyone's problems.", "Natural consequences is a nice way of saying fuck around and find out. I.e. climb this unsafe tree, fall out. Play with knife, cut self. Stay up too late, be a cranky B the next day.", "It\u2019s the rewarding with screen time and sugary treats that is unhealthy not the stickers", "Rewarding with food and restricting it otherwise can lead to eating disorders quite easily.", "Rewards don\u2019t encourage intrinsic motivation.", "No one's giving you a reward for brushing your teeth as an adult.", "I\u2019d say yes good to brush his teeth - that\u2019s a habit every kid needs to develop for its own sake.  \n\nSugar - sure, a lot is not good in terms of cookies, cakes, candy and ice cream - but that\u2019s more of a diet issue IMO - but fruit, juice, fruit leather, jelly on a sandwich, etc. is just regular eating in my opinion, not a sugar issue. I\u2019m reading OP as just not allowing treats like cookies or candy - but restricting sugar altogether.  Maybe I\u2019m reading his comments wrong though.", "The issue isn't now, the issue is when he's 15 and has access to vending machines and the internet. Or 20 and at college.", "Seriously, if they\u2019re concerned about having a healthy relationship with sugar, this is just about the worst possible way to go about it.", "Came here to say this. OP\u2019s setting up his kid for some food issues if sweets only = \u201cgood behavior\u201d", "I will die before I allow a beet to enter my household.", "This just teaches binging behaviour", "That's not really spoiling.  Surely you or your regular babysitters do those things with him too.", "Look I get it your house your rules.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to be mean grandma. Maybe hire an actual babysitter and let grandma \u201cspoil\u201d him on her own fun times. Otherwise this will continue to happen.", "It sounds like a no. And\u2026 that\u2019s probably the right answer. It sounds like just what you should do for (good) family.", "You are not a very clear communicator.", "So you yourself have fond memories of doing something with your grandmother OF WHICH YOUR MOTHER DISAPPROVED. \n\nHmmmmmm", "So glad you have such lovely memories. That's what your son needs from a grandma. Maybe suggestions of activities instead of treats will resonate with her if you mention this? How will she want to be remembered?", "You said parents who don\u2019t use behavior charts are lazy and would rather beat their kids. TF? That\u2019s just a ridiculous statement.", "I have the same issue. I started washing my mouth out with water a few times a day, always after meals too, and it's helped.", "I had a dentist explain sometimes it's your gums, sometimes it's the teeth but basically no matter what some people have issues. I've only gotten 2 cavities in my whole life, and one I think is because of pregnancy.", "Acidic saliva, most likely. Low pH levels means when she has sugar or carbs, her spit gets acidic and harms her teeth. My dad, my sister and I all have the same issue.", "Yeahhh I work at a bakery in a college town and the moment that a college student realizes they can buy cake just because... They do.", "This is anecdotal. I was never allowed sodas as a kid and I still don\u2019t drink them. I never developed a taste for it.", "It's not teaching moderation.\n\nEvery single kid I've known to grow up this way has had a very unhealthy/ swing back with impulse control.\n\nIt's not usually or just candy and food though, it's drinking and drugs.", "That\u2019s what my husband says", "No it doesn\u2019t. Halloween and Christmas he barely ate any sweets despite the access. He wasn\u2019t interested and he got to try soda and didn\u2019t like it.", "Yea but it\u2019s extra special if he does it with someone he sees less often.", "That is not what I said.  What I said was people that complain about behavior charts behave that way.", "Having fond recollections of a freshman year friend with parents like OP that discovered the dining hall had a waffle maker every. single. day. with chocolate chips.", "Cool. Many people have posted all the actual research on the topic, and why you're setting your kid up for an unhealthy relationship with food. He's your kid, so unfortunately you get to do whatever you like, so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "That is true and lovely.  But a grandparent wants to be able to give the grandchild something they don't usually get.  Maybe they can stay up half an hour later.  Maybe they can have a small extra treat.  Maybe screen time, if earned, can be a little longer.  It doesn't have to be huge.  But there's major grandparent bonding in the little indulgences.  Find a way to allow this without interfering with your parenting goals and values. (Edit:) or maybe Grandma could even take him to buy a new book when he visits, or a new toy that stays at Grandma's house, or even a really cool piece of clothing he wants, if Grandma is in a financial position to buy things for him.", "Reread your comment.", "No that\u2019s literally what they said - they said folks who aren\u2019t willing to use behavior charts are the type to beat their kid - meaning that inconsistent parenting = no clear expectations tied to consistent rewards means frustrated parents and kids who aren\u2019t getting clear direction.  \n\nDid you actually read their comment?", "Maybe you should.", "I think you are very confused and have a deluded way of thinking."]}
