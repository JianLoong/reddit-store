She told me very specifically that she wanted to be the one to handle her problems with my mom. \n\nThe family gathering was going really well, I was having a beer with my cousin who I hadn't seen in a couple years and no drama to speak of up to that point. Then I heard my mom yelling. I ran towards the commotion and saw my mom and Mia arguing. Mia saw me and said stay out of it but I could see she was holding back tears. My mom then asked what I saw in some \"floozy\" (yes really) and that's when I stepped in. A bit of back and forth arguing lead lead to me giving my mom an ultimatum: either accept that I love Mia and treat her with respect, or I go NC. Still haven't gotten a response on that.\n\nWe left and bought a hotel room for the rest of the trip. In the car, Mia was really angry and said that my mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't get a chance to fight her own battles.

But this is different.  This is about you and your relationship with your mother, equally to your mother's relationship with Mia.  \n\nSo NAH\n\nMia is right to feel that you stepped on her autonomy because you did, but she's also failing to recognize that your history and relationship with your mother and THAT relationship, color this interaction.  \n\nYou get a pass solely because it's your mother.  If this were ANYONE else, you'd be the complete asshole.", "NTA: OP, Mom addressed you. At that point you became my involved. At that point, the topic of discussion became your concern.", "NTA. Mia is under the delusion that your mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't stand up for herself.\n\nThe reality is that there is nothing she could do to earn your mother's respect. Because your mom is the problem which you are very aware of. \n\nThe reality is that your mother will always find something wrong with anyone you date because she views these partners as obstacles to you. I can't fault you for calling your mom out on her bullshit which really has nothing to do with Mia and everything to do with your mother being emotionally incestuous.", "NAH except your mom.   Your mom directed her comment to you.   That couldn\u2019t go unanswered but Mia needs to be able to deal with her directly as well", "NTA. When your mom asked what you saw in some \"floozy\", you responded by defending **yourself**. Mia cannot reasonably ask  you to refrain from doing that.", "I struggled with this when I was learning to have my own voice (like Mia is doing). My therapist showed me that I can have my own voice whilst being in a partnership. Having your own voice and learning to stand up for yourself doesn\u2019t mean having to do everything alone. \n\nI used to get angry if anyone helped me because of my want to prove I could do it alone, so my husband worked out a neat thing that works for me - he asks if he can be my partner in this or can he be with me in this. \n\nIn this circumstance, he would say \u2018I\u2019m with Hamigakiko mum. We are partners in this.\u2019 \n\nIt means Mia is still fighting her battles, but you are giving a very clear message to your mother that you stand together and she cannot break you apart. \n\nYou can then after follow up with your boundaries to your mother. \n\nHave a talk with your gf about how you want to support her but some of your life battles (like this one) do involve you both. Yes, she was attacking Mia, but she (mother) was also attacking you by taking away your agency to choose a life partner and crossing your boundaries, so you do have a right to fight that battle to. \n\nI would encourage you both to look at the grey rock method too. Seldom does it work with people like your mother to fight - to them, as soon as you fight - they have already won. \n\nNAH", "NTA, two things can be right at the same time, it's right for you to defend Mia and it's right for her to defend herself.  Your fight: your mother should respect your choices and mia's: your mother should respect her as a person.", "NTA. I get that Mia wants to fight her own battles, but it's also important to support each other in conflicts, especially when it involves your family members. I think it would have been much worse if you just stood on the sidelines when your own mother is treating Mia like that.\n\nAlso, your mother asked you a question directly, involving you in the dispute. Are you just supposed to stay quiet after that? At that point you are now involved and it isn't just Mia's battle to fight.", "NAH, your girlfriend has every right to want to stand up for herself and not wanting you to swoop in to her defence. But also, the way I see it, while your mom is targeting your gf, she's also creating problems for you by doing that and you have every right to set boundaries with you could you have picked a better moment to do it? Yes, probably, bit I I understand both why you did and why your gf is angry\n\nEdit: No AHs except for mom ofc", "NAH - I get where Mia is coming from, but you will always kind of have some sort on involvement in disagreements with your mom, as she\u2019s your mom? I also think you were not just standing up for Mia, but standing up for yourself as well to try and put an end to confrontation like this occurring. \nBut I would have a chat with her about this to try and make amends, as she absolutely wanted to try and resolve this issue on her own you have, even if unintentionally, undermined that. I would cut out your mom though, that seems to be far more stress than it\u2019s worth.", ">\teither accept that I love Mia and treat her with respect, or I go NC.

Your girlfriend needs to realise your a team and you need to sort out your mother", "I see how Mia wanted to be proactive but disagree with her. It's your mother, you should be the one to tell her not to treat Mia badly. Standing back and saying nothing might make your mother think you either don't care or side with her instead of Mia.", "NTA-everything I heard or ever read says the BF or husband should deal with his own family and vice versa. It's unreasonable for her to ask you not to stand up for her..with your own family.", "NTA. Obviously there is no reasoning with your mother. Go NC until she agrees to respect Mia.", "nta - becuase your mom asked and gave the ultimatium and your responded from your heart.", "You do need to sincerely apologise to Mia for not being able to do what she asked. \n\nHowever\u2026 Your mom involved you, and challenged you, and you had to respond somehow to that. It\u2019s important your mom sees the two of you as united and mutually supportive. Standing up to your mom - as you both have seen now - makes no difference to how she behaves, and it is not acceptable. You gave your mom an ultimatum, and the right one too. Her behaviour is a choice she persists in making and there need to be consequences for that. Going NC needed to come from you, and had the most impact that way. Mia going NC is pretty clearly what your mom wants.\n\nWhat would have been a better plan would be for you and Mia to have a strategy, so if things were going south like this, or your mom dragged you into it, you\u2019d both agreed on what you should do and say. In the circumstances, it went the only way it could.\n\nNTA, but apologise and reassure her that nothing matters more to you than how she feels and what she wants, but you were put in an impossible situation.

It would be humiliating and embarrassing for your girlfriend if you had not stood up for her. Appreciate that your girlfriend feels unheard, but explain that your intentions were genuine.

Ideally you should have spoken to your mother afterwards.", "As much as few people would like to argue against you stepping in , I think this has more to do with you who shares close relationship with the person verbally attacking your partner , you did alot of help stepping in between them , honestly English isn't my first language and I had to search it up what sloozy actually meant , your mother has no respect for your relationships and boundaries and its your own job to handle the problem regarding your mother ,  your girlfriend is an introvert who will just end up getting hurt and let people like your own mother walk all over her , if it was a stranger then it would be a bit too much for you to step in and give off stereotypical white knight vibe , but that person is your mother and ofc you have everything to do with the issue .", "Nah yes she asked you to  stay out of it but your mom was straight up verbally abusing your gf.  There's a difference between fighting your own battles and having a screaming match in the kitchen.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't respect Mia because she doesn't want to. If this were a situation with a friend or a stranger then you jumping in would be an asshole move. But this is your mother. This is quite frankly all about her relationship with you and has very little to do with Mia.", "On every single MIL post, people complain their SOs don't stand up for them. I understand where she's coming from but it's sooo much better here that you said something.", "NTA This was your battle too. Your mom was questioning your choice in women. \n\nMia may not understand because she\u2019s a non-confrontational person who wouldn\u2019t have responded to a similar inquiry from her own mother. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to let it slide with your own mother.", "NTA since she told you to handle her problems with your mom. And also because your mom saying you were with a floozy was your issue with your mom, your mom was attacking your choice of partner so you can defend your choice to your mom without it being a situation where you were fighting Mia's battle. You were fighting your own, which was your mom saying you picked a bad partner and you disagreed. You can fight your mom when it comes to her disagreeing with you, which is what it was.", "Two separate issues.\n\nFirst, your mother - you don\u2019t need a reply from her about your ultimatum.

Mia is an adult: don't coddle her, don't treat her like a child who needs to be defended. She is able to express her opinion and handle the situation (there's a difference between defending your girlfriend from your mom's meanness and not giving Mia the chance to do it herself). It's enough for you to stay by Mia's side. It's okay to tell your mom that you don't tolerate her attitude, but don't speak up for your girlfriend. She has a voice and knows how to use it.\n\n\\- You have issues with your mom which probably go beyond Mia. Understandable, but perhaps you are projecting and take advantage of the tense situation between your mother and Mia to jump on the wagon and discuss YOUR issues with your mother.

I know that you had the best of intentions, but it sounds like your mum had been treating Mia pretty terribly for a while, right? This doesn\u2019t sound like new behavior and it sounds like Mia had really put a lot of work in to try tackle it. \n\nIt also sounds like your mum then used your presence in the conversation as a way to further attack Mia. Is that also normal behavior from her?

This is more for her than for your mother, your mother may never respect her, but Mia needs to know she can respect herself, and it seems a lot of that is tied up in being able to stand on her own two feet. She might cry, and it will be hard to watch, but she can get through it and honestly it's only going to make your mom look bad for making someone cry at something meant to be a fun family function, but at least Mia will know she can stand up for herself, and that will be a win for her.", "Best of luck OP you have some tough working out to do with your partner, it takes two to make this work, and hopefully your both become stronger for it, and maybe one day your mother can accept she was wrong, and love you both.\n\nNAH", "The only a h here is your mom.

In fact her \u201cstanding up for herself\u201d only resulted in your mother escalating the drama into a loud commotion and from her \u201cfloozy\u201d comment showed your mother did not increase her respect for Mia at all.", "NAH\n\nThat said, your mom involved you and you laid it out to mom in no uncertain terms.

I can open up in maybe how she feels a bit as I was also in a long term relationship from a young age with severe anxiety over what my future MIL thought of me.\n\n1 You may want to consider that there might be something shes working on with her counselor and fighting her personal battles. \n\n2 You need to reassure her that your moms way of thinking isn't related to her directly. You can't change people who feel this way, but if she's thinking of marrying you then she may want a strong solid relationship with her before proceeding.\n\n3 This was my personal experience, but my ex husband's mom accuses me of stealing him away from his family saying I had no right. It caused me such grief that I just avoid his family any chance I get. Even though I paid his rent for 4 years working 2 jobs while he went to school I was also viewed as not good enough. It messes with your mind. I promise you she is unwell and there were times I also stuck up for myself, but ultimately your family will \"side\" with you no matter what. She may not understand that last part yet.\n\n4 Floozy ? How can you call someone that after they've been in a long term committed relationship? You absolutely did what any sane person would do.", "OP while I am also leaning towards NAH (between you and Mia, not your mother- holy AH on that one) I think maybe going forward with this specific situation, you could explain to Mia that you weren\u2019t fighting HER battle with your mother. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that\u2019s what you were trying to do in any way. Your mother did involve you, and you reacted to that. While I see how Mia took it as you trying to come to her rescue, it would feel that way after asking you to not involve yourself in her confrontations, you were specifically asked a question in the argument. Had you said nothing, your mother would have turned to Mia and said much worse than she already did. \u201cSEE? He has no answer, no reason for you to be in OUR lives.\u201d I\u2019m sure it would be with uglier words but, it would have surely turned into you having no reason for burdening your poor mother with having to deal with this useless, awful woman! Poor mommy! Having to have another woman in her son\u2019s life, meaning her life!? Obviously (SO sarcastically) the worst thing that could ever happen to HER! \n\nIf Mia wants to confront your mother again, I think before you leave (if you haven\u2019t already) it would be very cathartic for her to do so. If you choose to do this, a conversation should be had on how to go about it. Personally, I think as a team would be best - if Mia can see that you are not fighting her battles but your combined battle. If this relationship is going to last long term, this thing with your mother should be fought together. Her fighting alone will never amount to anything that your mother takes seriously, and I hope she can see that. While it\u2019s understandable that your mother took an overprotective outlook on her son after losing her husband, this is the highest level of unhealthy. Your mother needs a hard reality check on what is okay and what is not. You are your own person, you are of age to be making your own family with the woman you choose to spend your forever with - your mother is not an insider in that family. \n\nMaybe suggest to Mia that you have a final conversation with your mother, have her (Mia) speak her mind - anything and everything she has to say to your mother about how she treats her and your relationship.. but start that conversation with you stating that you support her in what she says, how she feels, and how she wants things to go moving forward, rather than interjecting in the heat of the moment. If she wants to do this, start out that way and then sit back and hold her hand. Be unified but silent. If at the end of the conversation your mother continues with the attack, leave without saying anything more. Let Mia have the last word - after you make it known at the start that you support this, you agree with this, and this is NOT Mia \u201ctaking mommy\u2019s precious boy away\u201d but the two of you being a team and not taking your mother\u2019s unhealthy obsessive bullshit. \n\nI wish you both all the best! Also, if it doesn\u2019t involve your mother, stay out of it :] in this situation, whoa buddy I don\u2019t think you had a choice.. and your mother knew that. You should also probably go no contact regardless of the outcome, at least for a while, to make your mother see that things need to drastically change for her to be a part of your life - Mia or no Mia.", "NTA.\n\nI might be in the minority (not in the rating, but what I am about to say), but I think Mia should be the one to apologize to you. It\u2019s one thing if you did this to a boss of her\u2019s who was taking advantage of her hard work or something, you have no skin in the game there. However, this was YOUR mom. I would never expect my partner to sit there and do nothing while his mom or dad berated me. Also, there are different ways of standing up for yourself that should be considered in different situations. This was not a situation that should have resulted in a yelling match between Mia and your mom. \n\nIf I was Mia, I would have simply told your mom \u201cNot now, this is the not the time or place for this nonsense\u201d and walked off and avoided your mom for the rest of the night. I would have then talked to you about it and said that we should have a talk with your mom on how to deal with this open hostility since I am here to stay. However, I would had you lead the meeting as it is YOUR mom. I would have been the one leading if the situation was reversed and my mom was causing the problem. \n\nI am also a very non-confrontational person by nature, so I know it\u2019s a big deal to stick up for yourself. However, stooping to their level isn\u2019t sticking up for yourself, and your mom would have (probably does) just used that as more fodder to hate Mia.", "NTA, only because you know your mother better than Mia does.  Go ahead and go NC with mom, since she never responded to your ultimatum.\n\nPlease let Mia handle her own battles from now on.\n\nMy mother did not accept my wife until we have our second child. I guess she finally realized that we are in it for the log run. We have been married for 43 years now.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this, Mia is wrong. YOu NEED to stand uo rto your mom, and this is not about MIA but about the relationship between you and your mom. This is about your mom insulting YOU and your life decissions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMia can do her therapy work with other situations.", "Nta\nHonestly I think that partner's family is partner's problem and, while I can and would stand up for myself, I would expect from my partner to put a step down an resolve problem with his family.", "tell your wife that she doesn't have to be the hero of the day to leave behind her shyness, it doesn't matter if she fights or not, your mother is an idiot and will always look down on her, NTA your mother is toxic I recommend you stay away from her", "You took the words right out of my mind. I read the title and thought \u201coh great let\u2019s hear this guy\u2019s excuse to meddle in someone else\u2019s business against their wish\u201d but this here is different. It\u2019s about OPs relationship with his mother as well. And the mother involved him by asking him why he was with Mia. What should OP do? Be silent? Walk away? Yeah the mother would see this as a triumph over the gf. \n\nBut I also feel for Mia. She works on standing up for herself so this was probably quite a success for her at the beginning - the fact that they got into a shouting match proves that was not taking it. So I can see how it feels for her like the empowering feeling just vanished because in the end someone else defended her again. \n\nI agree with NAH. But OP, you should rephrase it. Don\u2019t say defending her or fighting her battles - because it\u2019s not. You defended your relationship and also your own boundaries. You defended yourself from your mother and the boundary that she has to at the very least tolerate your choice of partner.", "Agreed.  Mia can stand up for herself until she is blue in the face but until you draw your line in the sand too your mom won\u2019t stop.  This really isn\u2019t about Mia at all, it\u2019s about your mom not knowing when to stop and accept your choices.", "I agree with that and I express my NAH on this but I would like to add that is not only the mother but any other close family member. He could and SHOULD butt in also If it was his father or any of his siblings, and the list stops there. It doesn't extend not even to siblings' spouses.", "I agree with so NTA  \n\n\nBut OP, but to have handled it better you should have let your GF handle it as she requested but once your GF had said what she wanted to say, then address your concerns with your Mom.  \n(However in the heat of the moment I can see why you didn't)", "I agree, what Mia fails to realize here is there is no winning this woman over and if she stands up for herself his mom is likely just to get nastier.", "100% this is the answer! His mom directly addressed him, so at that point it became his battle to fight. Honestly if I were OP, I wouldn\u2019t give my mom the option. I would go NC at least for a while and when I felt she was in a time out long enough I would give her one chance to sincerely apologize. I would also need to see majorly changed behavior from that point forward because she is lucky she is getting that one last opportunity.", "absolutely agree. NTA.", "I think my mom is emotionally enmeshed with me, I'm an only child and my dad died when I was 8. Ever since my mom's been super overprotective and realizing that she didn't see me as anything other than her baby boy is why I ended up moving across the country for college. I wish I wasn't forced to choose between her and having my own life", "And also it\u2019s not Mia\u2019s line to draw \u201crespect me or lose your relationship with your son\u201d. It\u2019s not her mom or her family. It\u2019s OP\u2019s line to draw and he did a good job of it. \n\n\nIf Mia would have gone nuclear like that SHE would have been TA. \n\n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY OP\u2019s fight to fight.", "This is excellent advice. I was struggling to think of how he might have navigated this to show support for Mia but not take over the fight and take away her voice, and I think you hit the nail on the head.", "Love this. So insightful!", "Exactly! Mia could have also gotten upset with him if he just stood there and did nothing. He was in a lose lose situation, and I think OP made the right call.", "The difference in this situation is that it is HIS family, not hers. She could have also gotten upset if he didn\u2019t step in and the fight escalated. I think the general rule of thumb is to stick up for your partner no matter what. Especially when it involves your partner\u2019s family, you cannot expect them to sit there and do nothing. If she wants to learn to stand up for herself, great, she should, but she also cannot be upset when the person she is standing up to is his mom, not hers. My parents never overstep that boundary, they always deal with their own family member if someone is being disrespectful towards their spouse.", "The OP did not interfere when the mother was berating Mia. He only stepped in because his mother was talking about their relationship to him.\n\nMia can't set a boundary about topics including the OP. NTA", "Not Jewish but my mom has Jewish friends so maybe she learned it from them? idk", "The mum turned and started addressing him after he walked in because he heard yelling. Does he now have to sit quiet in the corner even if someone begins talking to him? Also while true in some circumstances that she needs to handle confrontation, its blatantly obvious that her struggling to stand up to confrontation isn't the reason for his mum not liking her. The Mum has a common prejudice against anyone he dates, its obviously happened before as OP has brought it up in the post. \n\nSo i suppose in my eyes:\n1. Him defending himself when his mum turns around on him isn't him jumping to her defence even if it ends to the same effect.\n2. The entire premise of why she wants to do the confronting is unwarranted and he shouldn't have to stand by and watch while his mum blows up a family gathering. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re both! You\u2019re girlfriend is in therapy for a reason  have to understand she loves you so much she is willing to argue with your mom and stand up for a herself. She needs to have her big girl pants on without your help. Please allow her to do so in every aspect of her life. Good luck. Maybe couples therapy in the future is a good thing. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "She doesn't get to unilaterally handle issues about the relationship. The mom clearly was talking to the OP. NTA", "I think this is the real answer.  If Mia wants and needs the opportunity to practice standing up to your mom,  you owe her the respect and support to give it to her.", "I meant it in relation to my mom specifically but I respect your opinion", "Is he meant to just stand there while she gets yelled at though?", "After reading the comments I might add.  I do not allow anyone to disrespect my man in my presence and will be vocal about it.  If he is in a fight he can definitely handle himself but as soon as voices are raised or name calling begins.  I will jump in.\n\nI expect the same from him and believe me between the two of us in a verbal altercation I will do far more damage to my opponent.  I can handle my own without question and because of childhood issues I have solid boundaries that I do not allow people to cross.  He still needs to have my back and I need to know it.\n\nMy ex husband was a let her handle it kind of dude.  There were so many situations that could have been de-esculated if he just spoke up it was sad.  Ie drunk dude at a bar coming on to me way to hard.  If he would have stepped in at the beginning he would not have tried to touch me and I would not have laid him out on the table.  When we had the discussion afterwards he stated I know you can handle it and you did.  Yes yes I did but I had to resort to violence when you could have ended it with words.  \n\nI will never be with another partner who won't demand respect for me again.", "The only thing I\u2019ll add is if OP stands by and lets Mia stand up to his mother - what\u2019s the resolution? \n\nIf *Mia* says she wants to go no contact then she\u2019s \u201cthat troublemaking girl getting between me and my son!\u201d\n\nIf OP enforced that boundary then he\u2019s telling his mother directly he won\u2019t stand for this kind of behaviour. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t leave your partner to argue with your family - you need to have their back.", "Your last paragraph is absolutely correct and I thought the same.  Just haven't had enough coffee to articulate.  He's viewing this as defending HER when in his mind that makes him a hero (vomit) when in reality he's defending himself.  And that's the only thing that makes this okay.", "Well it's only my mom so if we go NC I guess this situation won't recur.", "OMG that makes it so much sadder. She could have had an amazing relationship with you, Mia, your friends, your potential future children, and had such a beautiful life and she can't get out of her own way. It's her fault now. I am so sorry, I wouldn't decide now to cut her off forever, but she needs to make some major changes if she wants you in her life, with or without Mia.\n\nI see where Mia is coming from, but I also do not know how you'd possibly stay quiet when your mother calls the woman you love a floozy/any name.\n\nNAH (except your mom)", "NTA because you know how to handle your mom and what's driving her better than your GF does. And in this particular case, your mom *addressed you.* It would have been wrong for you to ignire that and do nothing while the bullying continued.", "Good on your for recognizing the issues. So many women have been chased out of relationships when their SO doesn\u2019t put boundary in place and stick to them.", "She made it clear how she wanted to handle it and he obviously agreed before hand.\nAnd if he hadn\u2019t come running to her defence and got involved in the convo between mum and gf, mum wouldn\u2019t have said it to him and gotten himself involved", "I don't think I'm a hero and I'm sorry if the post came across that way", "His mom was talking to him about his relationship. Mia does not get to set a boundary about him not reacting about their relationship.\n\nThe OP rightfully did not respond when his mom was berating Mia. He only responded when his Mom talked to him about his own relationship", "Tell your GF that when it comes to situations like this, a united front has to be formed.  This is your family and when you say something, it has more impact. Even if she stood up to your mother on a frequent basis, mom will still not respect her.  That does not happen all of the time. Some people will respect you and stand down and others will take offense and continue the battle.  She needs to know this.", "Hey, I think it makes you a hero because I have very seldom seen behavior like that. Hats off to you.", "If he hadn\u2019t run in he wouldn\u2019t be there to be asked about the \u2018floozy\u2019.\nEither way still think it\u2019s gentle territory because she wanted to handle the interactions between mum and her. If he hadn\u2019t come running in he wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved.", "I see supporting my gf as something that's a basic requirement for a healthy relationship, I came here because I wasn't sure if what I did was harmful, but even if I did the right thing that just means I was being a supportive partner, not a hero", "Are you suggesting I should've sat on my ass and drank my beer when I heard the 2 of them going at it?", "Absolutely! Too many people allow their parents/family to stomp all over their partners, so it\u2019s refreshing to see a man who recognizes that his mother is one of *\u201dthose\u201d* mothers. Kudos to you for standing your ground with your mother and setting firm boundaries.\n\nI hope Mia can come to the realization that you weren\u2019t trying to be an unnecessary hero; rather, you were establishing a perimeter around your relationship. It\u2019s absolutely vital to do what you did. NTA.", "Ugh can we clone you? You turned out well.", "That\u2019s definitely what your girlfriends saying - and hers is really the only opinion that matters, no?"]}
