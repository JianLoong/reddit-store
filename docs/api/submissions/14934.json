Then I heard my mom yelling. I ran towards the commotion and saw my mom and Mia arguing. Mia saw me and said stay out of it but I could see she was holding back tears. My mom then asked what I saw in some \"floozy\" (yes really) and that's when I stepped in.

Still haven't gotten a response on that.\n\nWe left and bought a hotel room for the rest of the trip. In the car, Mia was really angry and said that my mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't get a chance to fight her own battles.

But this is different.  This is about you and your relationship with your mother, equally to your mother's relationship with Mia.  \n\nSo NAH\n\nMia is right to feel that you stepped on her autonomy because you did, but she's also failing to recognize that your history and relationship with your mother and THAT relationship, color this interaction.  \n\nYou get a pass solely because it's your mother.  If this were ANYONE else, you'd be the complete asshole.", "NTA: OP, Mom addressed you. At that point you became my involved. At that point, the topic of discussion became your concern.", "NTA. Mia is under the delusion that your mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't stand up for herself.\n\nThe reality is that there is nothing she could do to earn your mother's respect. Because your mom is the problem which you are very aware of. \n\nThe reality is that your mother will always find something wrong with anyone you date because she views these partners as obstacles to you. I can't fault you for calling your mom out on her bullshit which really has nothing to do with Mia and everything to do with your mother being emotionally incestuous.", "NAH except your mom.   Your mom directed her comment to you.   That couldn\u2019t go unanswered but Mia needs to be able to deal with her directly as well", "NTA. When your mom asked what you saw in some \"floozy\", you responded by defending **yourself**. Mia cannot reasonably ask  you to refrain from doing that.", "I struggled with this when I was learning to have my own voice (like Mia is doing). My therapist showed me that I can have my own voice whilst being in a partnership. Having your own voice and learning to stand up for yourself doesn\u2019t mean having to do everything alone. \n\nI used to get angry if anyone helped me because of my want to prove I could do it alone, so my husband worked out a neat thing that works for me - he asks if he can be my partner in this or can he be with me in this. \n\nIn this circumstance, he would say \u2018I\u2019m with Hamigakiko mum. We are partners in this.\u2019 \n\nIt means Mia is still fighting her battles, but you are giving a very clear message to your mother that you stand together and she cannot break you apart. \n\nYou can then after follow up with your boundaries to your mother. \n\nHave a talk with your gf about how you want to support her but some of your life battles (like this one) do involve you both. Yes, she was attacking Mia, but she (mother) was also attacking you by taking away your agency to choose a life partner and crossing your boundaries, so you do have a right to fight that battle to. \n\nI would encourage you both to look at the grey rock method too. Seldom does it work with people like your mother to fight - to them, as soon as you fight - they have already won. \n\nNAH", "NTA, two things can be right at the same time, it's right for you to defend Mia and it's right for her to defend herself.  Your fight: your mother should respect your choices and mia's: your mother should respect her as a person.", "NTA. I get that Mia wants to fight her own battles, but it's also important to support each other in conflicts, especially when it involves your family members. I think it would have been much worse if you just stood on the sidelines when your own mother is treating Mia like that.\n\nAlso, your mother asked you a question directly, involving you in the dispute. Are you just supposed to stay quiet after that? At that point you are now involved and it isn't just Mia's battle to fight.", "NAH, your girlfriend has every right to want to stand up for herself and not wanting you to swoop in to her defence. But also, the way I see it, while your mom is targeting your gf, she's also creating problems for you by doing that and you have every right to set boundaries with you could you have picked a better moment to do it? Yes, probably, bit I I understand both why you did and why your gf is angry\n\nEdit: No AHs except for mom ofc", "NAH - I get where Mia is coming from, but you will always kind of have some sort on involvement in disagreements with your mom, as she\u2019s your mom? I also think you were not just standing up for Mia, but standing up for yourself as well to try and put an end to confrontation like this occurring. \nBut I would have a chat with her about this to try and make amends, as she absolutely wanted to try and resolve this issue on her own you have, even if unintentionally, undermined that. I would cut out your mom though, that seems to be far more stress than it\u2019s worth.", ">\teither accept that I love Mia and treat her with respect, or I go NC.

Your girlfriend needs to realise your a team and you need to sort out your mother", "I see how Mia wanted to be proactive but disagree with her. It's your mother, you should be the one to tell her not to treat Mia badly. Standing back and saying nothing might make your mother think you either don't care or side with her instead of Mia.", "NTA-everything I heard or ever read says the BF or husband should deal with his own family and vice versa. It's unreasonable for her to ask you not to stand up for her..with your own family.", "NTA. Obviously there is no reasoning with your mother. Go NC until she agrees to respect Mia.", "nta - becuase your mom asked and gave the ultimatium and your responded from your heart.", "You do need to sincerely apologise to Mia for not being able to do what she asked. \n\nHowever\u2026 Your mom involved you, and challenged you, and you had to respond somehow to that. It\u2019s important your mom sees the two of you as united and mutually supportive. Standing up to your mom - as you both have seen now - makes no difference to how she behaves, and it is not acceptable. You gave your mom an ultimatum, and the right one too. Her behaviour is a choice she persists in making and there need to be consequences for that. Going NC needed to come from you, and had the most impact that way. Mia going NC is pretty clearly what your mom wants.\n\nWhat would have been a better plan would be for you and Mia to have a strategy, so if things were going south like this, or your mom dragged you into it, you\u2019d both agreed on what you should do and say. In the circumstances, it went the only way it could.\n\nNTA, but apologise and reassure her that nothing matters more to you than how she feels and what she wants, but you were put in an impossible situation.

It would be humiliating and embarrassing for your girlfriend if you had not stood up for her. Appreciate that your girlfriend feels unheard, but explain that your intentions were genuine.

You didn't defend mia. You defended your relationship. You didn't do anything when your mom berated her. You stepped in when it was about your life.", "NTA I do believe that you should have stayed out of it and let Mia handle it but I understand why you defended her, it would be very difficult to say nothing. Ideally you should have spoken to your mother afterwards.", "As much as few people would like to argue against you stepping in , I think this has more to do with you who shares close relationship with the person verbally attacking your partner , you did alot of help stepping in between them , honestly English isn't my first language and I had to search it up what sloozy actually meant , your mother has no respect for your relationships and boundaries and its your own job to handle the problem regarding your mother ,  your girlfriend is an introvert who will just end up getting hurt and let people like your own mother walk all over her , if it was a stranger then it would be a bit too much for you to step in and give off stereotypical white knight vibe , but that person is your mother and ofc you have everything to do with the issue .", "Nah yes she asked you to  stay out of it but your mom was straight up verbally abusing your gf.  There's a difference between fighting your own battles and having a screaming match in the kitchen.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't respect Mia because she doesn't want to. If this were a situation with a friend or a stranger then you jumping in would be an asshole move. But this is your mother. This is quite frankly all about her relationship with you and has very little to do with Mia.", "On every single MIL post, people complain their SOs don't stand up for them. I understand where she's coming from but it's sooo much better here that you said something.", "NTA This was your battle too. Your mom was questioning your choice in women. \n\nMia may not understand because she\u2019s a non-confrontational person who wouldn\u2019t have responded to a similar inquiry from her own mother. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to let it slide with your own mother.", "NTA since she told you to handle her problems with your mom. And also because your mom saying you were with a floozy was your issue with your mom, your mom was attacking your choice of partner so you can defend your choice to your mom without it being a situation where you were fighting Mia's battle. You were fighting your own, which was your mom saying you picked a bad partner and you disagreed. You can fight your mom when it comes to her disagreeing with you, which is what it was.", "Two separate issues.\n\nFirst, your mother - you don\u2019t need a reply from her about your ultimatum.

Mia is an adult: don't coddle her, don't treat her like a child who needs to be defended. She is able to express her opinion and handle the situation (there's a difference between defending your girlfriend from your mom's meanness and not giving Mia the chance to do it herself). It's enough for you to stay by Mia's side. It's okay to tell your mom that you don't tolerate her attitude, but don't speak up for your girlfriend. She has a voice and knows how to use it.\n\n\\- You have issues with your mom which probably go beyond Mia. Understandable, but perhaps you are projecting and take advantage of the tense situation between your mother and Mia to jump on the wagon and discuss YOUR issues with your mother.

I know that you had the best of intentions, but it sounds like your mum had been treating Mia pretty terribly for a while, right? This doesn\u2019t sound like new behavior and it sounds like Mia had really put a lot of work in to try tackle it. \n\nIt also sounds like your mum then used your presence in the conversation as a way to further attack Mia. Is that also normal behavior from her?

This is more for her than for your mother, your mother may never respect her, but Mia needs to know she can respect herself, and it seems a lot of that is tied up in being able to stand on her own two feet. She might cry, and it will be hard to watch, but she can get through it and honestly it's only going to make your mom look bad for making someone cry at something meant to be a fun family function, but at least Mia will know she can stand up for herself, and that will be a win for her.", "Best of luck OP you have some tough working out to do with your partner, it takes two to make this work, and hopefully your both become stronger for it, and maybe one day your mother can accept she was wrong, and love you both.\n\nNAH", "The only a h here is your mom.

In fact her \u201cstanding up for herself\u201d only resulted in your mother escalating the drama into a loud commotion and from her \u201cfloozy\u201d comment showed your mother did not increase her respect for Mia at all.", "NAH\n\nThat said, your mom involved you and you laid it out to mom in no uncertain terms.

I can open up in maybe how she feels a bit as I was also in a long term relationship from a young age with severe anxiety over what my future MIL thought of me.\n\n1 You may want to consider that there might be something shes working on with her counselor and fighting her personal battles. \n\n2 You need to reassure her that your moms way of thinking isn't related to her directly. You can't change people who feel this way, but if she's thinking of marrying you then she may want a strong solid relationship with her before proceeding.\n\n3 This was my personal experience, but my ex husband's mom accuses me of stealing him away from his family saying I had no right. It caused me such grief that I just avoid his family any chance I get. Even though I paid his rent for 4 years working 2 jobs while he went to school I was also viewed as not good enough. It messes with your mind. I promise you she is unwell and there were times I also stuck up for myself, but ultimately your family will \"side\" with you no matter what. She may not understand that last part yet.\n\n4 Floozy ? How can you call someone that after they've been in a long term committed relationship? You absolutely did what any sane person would do.", "OP while I am also leaning towards NAH (between you and Mia, not your mother- holy AH on that one) I think maybe going forward with this specific situation, you could explain to Mia that you weren\u2019t fighting HER battle with your mother. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that\u2019s what you were trying to do in any way. Your mother did involve you, and you reacted to that. While I see how Mia took it as you trying to come to her rescue, it would feel that way after asking you to not involve yourself in her confrontations, you were specifically asked a question in the argument. Had you said nothing, your mother would have turned to Mia and said much worse than she already did. \u201cSEE? He has no answer, no reason for you to be in OUR lives.\u201d I\u2019m sure it would be with uglier words but, it would have surely turned into you having no reason for burdening your poor mother with having to deal with this useless, awful woman! Poor mommy! Having to have another woman in her son\u2019s life, meaning her life!? Obviously (SO sarcastically) the worst thing that could ever happen to HER! \n\nIf Mia wants to confront your mother again, I think before you leave (if you haven\u2019t already) it would be very cathartic for her to do so. If you choose to do this, a conversation should be had on how to go about it. Personally, I think as a team would be best - if Mia can see that you are not fighting her battles but your combined battle. If this relationship is going to last long term, this thing with your mother should be fought together. Her fighting alone will never amount to anything that your mother takes seriously, and I hope she can see that. While it\u2019s understandable that your mother took an overprotective outlook on her son after losing her husband, this is the highest level of unhealthy. Your mother needs a hard reality check on what is okay and what is not. You are your own person, you are of age to be making your own family with the woman you choose to spend your forever with - your mother is not an insider in that family. \n\nMaybe suggest to Mia that you have a final conversation with your mother, have her (Mia) speak her mind - anything and everything she has to say to your mother about how she treats her and your relationship.. but start that conversation with you stating that you support her in what she says, how she feels, and how she wants things to go moving forward, rather than interjecting in the heat of the moment.

I would have been the one leading if the situation was reversed and my mom was causing the problem. \n\nI am also a very non-confrontational person by nature, so I know it\u2019s a big deal to stick up for yourself.

Yeah the mother would see this as a triumph over the gf. \n\nBut I also feel for Mia. She works on standing up for herself so this was probably quite a success for her at the beginning - the fact that they got into a shouting match proves that was not taking it.

Him defending himself when his mum turns around on him isn't him jumping to her defence even if it ends to the same effect.\n2.

Your mom attacking Mia is also your mom attacking your life choices. 2) that one particular fight was going nowhere. Once you start crying, there's little chances you're going to establish anything with a borderline abusive MIL and finally 3) there's also the very concrete chance that no matter what Mia does or says your mom is never going to respect her because in fact she has no issues with her specifically.

But there is more here happening than just Mia's issues.  Your mother isn't someone that is going to be convinced to change her wrong attitudes or behaviors, by someone standing up to her.  She's someone, like my MIL, who takes things to extremes to try to force compliance.  \n\nCheck out those other subs, for lots of posts and comments that can help you to see how to stand firm to the boundary you set, and how to protect yourselves from someone dysfunctional, not normal.

She should have just told her \u201cwe are not dealing with this now\u201d and left the room. To get mad at the OP for sticking up to HIS mom for the both of them blows my mind. I understand that she wanted to be the one to do it, but at the same time, she wasn\u2019t doing it in a productive or healthy manner. She would have caused a scene that could have potentially caused more issues with the family, so the OP stepping in was honestly for the best.\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that she is angry at the OP that moves her to the slight AH category.

I truly do believe that my mom loves me and wants the best for me, she just can't express that in a healthy way.

That's why \"emotional abuse\" is so hard to define.   While there are definite instances, I know people who claim to be emotionally abused if their partner ever raises their voice.

Because she doesn\u2019t see him as a person with his own autonomy, he\u2019s her little boy\u2026 and that\u2019s her problem to deal with or have it dealt with for her, it would seem, as OP wasn\u2019t afraid of laying down the \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d/no contact boundary, and good on him for that. \n\nOP - what you did is commendable in a very tough situation, in a way it was lose-lose, if you\u2019d let your mom and GF argue it out you\u2019re giving up your own agency in your decisions on who you date as far as your mom is concerned, and by intervening when called for, it\u2019s upset your GF because she told you to stay out of it beforehand. But she couldn\u2019t know the way your mom would approach the argument would be to drag her son into it and call his decision making and his status as an adult into question, thereby dragging you into it. Honestly I think you would have been ta if you hadn\u2019t gotten involved. Sometimes you\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. But in this case, I think you did what was best for yourself and your GF. Honestly, long term, and what\u2019s best for your mom too. She needs to be reminded that if she wants access to the grandkids she needs to have a good relationship with the daughter in law. \n\nThe thing is the way they\u2019re all telling you to look at it is pretty much spot on. You were defending yourself, your relationship and your boundaries. Not just riding in as a white night for your GF, which is likely all she is currently able to see (her perspective instead of the bigger picture). That and you not respecting her boundaries (while that\u2019s true it\u2019s a very nuanced situation, and in this case it was called for).\nBut that\u2019s an emotional response, which she\u2019s entitled to, and when she\u2019s calm enough, try explaining that your mom was doing a lot more than just arguing with her at the point you had to step in, and that not stepping in to take up the fight to your family when your GF, your adulthood and your boundaries were all being disrespected by your mom would have been disrespectful to her and to your relationship, and could have started a pattern of behaviour with your mom that could have been catastrophic if allowed to carry on long term. It\u2019s a situation best nipped at the bud, which is what you were doing, not trying to step over her being assertive of herself, not diminishing her own agency\u2026 and don\u2019t forget to tell her you\u2019re proud of her for taking the fight to your mom\u2026 because it was very brave. But also find a way to explain that on the whole, it\u2019s not her job to deal with your family\u2019s negative behaviour, that a United front lead by you is how you both deal with negative behaviour from your family.\n\n\nTL;DR OP - you did good, and your GF is emotional at the moment (and it\u2019s not surprising). Make sure you acknowledge that, tell her you\u2019re proud of her and that when you jumped it in was because it was your job to take the fight to your family, that it was your problem when your mom questioned your place as a man, and your decision making. Because of this, while you acknowledge she asked you to stay out of it before hand, it wasn\u2019t possible or fair to her to stand mute while your mom used you as a weapon against her. \n\n\n\nGood luck OP, you seem like a good dude and like you understand better than most how your parents while significant in your life, cannot carry more weight than the person you choose as your partner. Nor can you accept poor treatment and disrespect of yourself or your partner from your family. \nI hope you can have a good talk with your GF and hopefully sort it out. I\u2019m a fairly quiet type myself and had to work on being assertive. Tell her it is achievable with some hard work.

Still haven't gotten a response on that.\n\nI disagree that this is only ok because it was his mother. Every relationship has some sort of emotional history that will color an interaction, unless it's a random stranger, or maybe a friend of a friend type-deal, but would it have been wrong if it was the sister or his friend? I think not. He wasn't just standing up for Mia, he was also standing up for himself, as that specific line 'floozy' was directed at him, not her. That brought him into the discussion. If they had just been having some random argument, it'd be different, but the mom was directly attacking his girlfriends character, and questioning his feelings for her as an attack vector in the argument.   \n\n\nSame applies if any other relationship had made those comments.", "Oof yeah I didn\u2019t even know how I would rate this one because on one hand he should respect Mia\u2019s wishes but on the other hand it\u2019s HIS mom screaming at Mia and he is physically right there \u2014 I\u2019d have trouble not saying anything in that situation.

Those are fighting words and he couldn\u2019t not get involved at that point. \n\nI sympathize with the GFs situation since she was as obviously prepared for something like this to go down, and she would have preferred for this confrontation to stay between her and the FMIL, but mom took that away from her the moment she tried to get her son to gang up on a woman he was always going to side with. Hopefully with a little time to cool off she will see that OP wasn\u2019t given a choice but to get involved and that he stood up for her when he could have said nothing and looked like he was agreeing with mommy calling her a floozy", "Good answer and jumping in to add that mommy dearest shot OP a question and demeaning the GF in that question, therefore it absolutely is his right to step in and shoot mom down.", "I'm fairly certain that my mother wouldn't approve of anyone not handpicked by her.

While it's important she learns to stand on her own two feet, part of that is recognising when you need to stand together as a unit. She's actually undermining herself in this situation because the message that would have been sent to your mother was that your silence actually means you agree with her, and she'd have taken it as encouragement to keep getting at Mia. \n\nMia needs to understand that you're a team and you have to work together, particularly in this instance and both actively present a united front.", "But you say \"he inserted himself into\" it. Once he was there because he heard the yelling, which seems natural for him to check out, what should he have done?

I think the way Mia behaved to the OP after the fight was what made her a bit of an AH (which I specified in my original comment).

She can expect him to NOT insert himself into it when she's upset, because he is not the guardian of her emotional state. SHE IS. And he doesn't get to make that decision for her, on any and all grounds.  If he was doing this solely FOR HER he's 100 percent the asshole, because she told him she didn't want that.  What mitigates him from BEING the asshole, is that his mother was the OTHER component of this, and his family dynamic is of equal importance to defend to HIM as her well being.  \n\nHe did the right thing, but for the total wrong reason.  If he did this FOR her, he's an asshole.

It's natural to check what's up when there's shouting, especially when it's two people I guess you love very much. But standing your ground was the best thing you can do.

He only heard his mom yelling, not his mom and gf.  Any sane person will hear a loved one yelling and be genuinely curious as to what is going on. If he were to hear both of them yelling, maybe then he inserted himself.

This is particularly true in cases where the parent has narcissistic tendencies like you describe from your mother. In picking a fight with Mia and insulting her, she was trying to control your relationship. This is about you and your mother\u2019s desire to control you, not Mia. So she really would have been fighting your battles in this scenario. When you stepped in, you did the right thing. You brought the confrontation back to the original source and target.

OP had to be the one to set the strict boundaries with his own mom. \n\nI do feel for Mia and I think this is a NAH (except mom) situation. But sometimes it's just not realistic to expect your partner not to weigh in, when the conflict is with said partner's family.", "No, at that point he was sticking up for himself when his mother addressed him. Besides, anything involving his mother immediately requires him to be involved. He\u2019s the main one that should be telling her to back off.", "Absolutely not! They should be putting up a united front instead of Mia insisting she do it on her own.", "This!", "Those are good observations.  \n\nAnother one is that it isn't that your mom doesn't respect Mia, but that she doesn't respect you as an adult. If you make Mia fight this battle alone, your mom will never back down. You have to make it clear to your mom that her battle is with you, and that she will have to begin treating you like an adult.", "Just don\u2019t break your arms OP.", "That's what I think too. If Mia will be the one who threatens with nc, she will be the girl who took her son away in the eyes of her mother. \n\nMia doesn't understand imo that respect isn't the main problem but jealousy from the mother.", "[removed]", "I feel like it's a pretty dated term these days. I remember hearing it a lot in the 90s but now only the older generations probably know the word, most 20 somethings and younger most likely wouldn't.", "The parent comment was made by AcrobaticSetting5079 who has multiple copycat comments in their history.

Your mother's real aim is to control you. As much as you need to support Mia, all of her arguments with your mom are really just your mother attempting to control you, which means the arguments really are between you and your mom and that's why this is the one conflict Mia probably can't manage. No matter what specific bone your mother might choose to pick, the arguments is always about your mom wishing she controls you. That's why you have to shut your mother down.", "Have you pointed out to Mia that in this particular situation, if you had stood there and said nothing while your Mum shouted at Mia and called her a floozy in front of your whole family, that would have sent a message to your Mum & your family that you don't care about Mia or respect her? Therefore their behaviour towards Mia would change, even on an unconscious level? For your Mum that would mean she would behave worse?\n\nIt's great Mia is learning how to stand up for herself. But this is your family. And if you don't publicly support your gf when your family is rude to her, it gives the impression that you are agreeing with the abuse.", "Agreed - or [as Captain Picard put it](https://youtu.be/1TCX90yALsI), \u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness - that is life.\u201d", "You did literally nothing wrong. As a man it is your job to protect your woman. Your mother is clearly having a son complex. You had every right to step in and defend your woman. Fuck all these soy boys talking about how you should let your woman fight her own battles.", "NTA. Even if you had stood there and watched your mother abuse your partner a little longer, you would have had to intervene for both your sakes. Maybe you could have said, \"Mom, are you through talking to Mia? Because I have something to say to you now\" but however you handled it, it had to be stopped. Your mom had crossed the line into nasty name-calling and psychological abuse.  \nI would reinforce your ultimatum to your mother, maybe even in writing--and then stick to it. She can be persona non grata in your life; and don't in any way let her separate you from Mia. Package deal or no deal at all. (No going over to see mom without Mia, for example. And if she's rude, then no going over to see mom at all. Maybe let Mia see the comments here!", "i agree. You really cant blame a guy for wanting to defend the woman he loves. Regardless of how he or she was raised, its a mans natural instinct to want to protect.", "No. No, it does not.", "NTA, but I would suggest that instead of giving your mom an ultimatum, you should have gone ahead and cut all contact.  Don't wait for her to apologize, tell her that you won't put up with her appalling behavior.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of person would calmly stand by and allow their mother to treat someone they care for this way? A bad person. It would have been a bad look, and would have encouraged your mom to be even worse. \nAnd - sometimes it's what people don't say that expresses how they feel most clearly. If you had said nothing, it would have expressed your disinterest. And, your Mom having said nothing likely means she's chosen to be NC", "NTA, given that it was your mother.", "NAH", "NTA. Mia is an idiot", "YTA\nOP kind of set himself and Mia up for this one.\nJust using the word \"floozy\" in reference to Mia, shows that mom has a serious problem and that this isnt her first time being abusive. OP should have never taken Mia into that chaos and should have been NC a long time ago.", "NAH. Mom and gf will probably never see eye to eye and you'll always get pulled in. Gf will get past this episode. But stay out of future conflicts between them.", "NTA, this is about the relationship that Mia has with your mom. You clearly already have some issues with your mother to begin with and this is just the icing on top. \n\nI suggest talking to your girlfriend and apologizing for making her feel like you didn\u2019t value her fighting her battles, but that you felt it would be wrong to not step in and take your girlfriend\u2019s side for the sake of your own relationship with your mom.\n\nI hope your girlfriend understands and forgives you soon, you should let her know that you\u2019re very proud of her for coming this far when it comes to confrontation. As an anxious person, it\u2019s not exactly easy and when you do get that courage you start to run on that high-horse of finding your own vengeance. So yeah, tell her you\u2019re proud of her and explain the situation on your end as well. A conversation will fix the animosity.", "If my mum called my girlfriend of 5 years a floozy, I wouldn't speak to her again. But it would be really traumatic -- oh no, I can't ever speak to my mum again! So naturally you were upset. Ask Mia if she can accept this explanation of your actions. NTA obviously.", "NTA\nMom *specifically* addressed you. \n\nMia isn't an AH here either, though. Good on her for seeking therapy,  and staying with + making progress in it. BUT your mother also needs therapy. \n\nAnd I fully support NC for the benefit of your relationship.  It has taken nearly 7 years, and a near-divorce, for my husband to realize the toxic behavior of his mother. \nDon't do the same to the person you love. You owe your mother, literally, nothing.", "NTA.  See if you can get Mia to understand that the two of you providing a unified front with your mom is not taking anything away from her ability to handle things herself.  If it had been anyone else, I\u2019d have told you to butt out, but this is your mother.  Mia can talk until she\u2019s blue in the face and it will have no effect on your mom because your mom doesn\u2019t care enough about her to worry about whether or not she\u2019s upset.  On the other hand, she loves you and this gives you leverage. You are her \u201ccurrency.\u201d The consequences have to come from you, with Mia present to reinforce that united front concept.  Your mom needs to learn that her behavior will cost her a relationship with her son and any potential future grandchildren, and this has to be administered by you. This is actually the one area in which you should take the lead, just as she should take the lead with her parents.\n\nAnything else, let her handle it.  Go get \u2018em, Tiger!", "YTA.  You can't save the day every time.  She wanted to fight this fight herself.  She told you before you ever got there that she would take care of herself.  She told you when she was in the middle of it to stay out and yet because you saw her close to tears you had to take over.\n\nBeing close to tears does not mean you are giving up.  It's just an emotion that can be used to fuel her standing up for herself.  Had your mother broken her, that would have been the time to get in there, but not while she is still holding her own.\n\nAdd to that that any respect your mother does show towards Mia will now be because of your ultimatum, not because Mia earned it.  You now need to wonder what harm you may have caused to her self confidence since she finally worked up the courage to stand for herself and you ran in and took over.", "NAH\n\nYour girlfriend explicitly asked you to give her the chance to defend herself, so y t a there. But at the same time she\u2019s not just insulting Mia, she\u2019s insulting you guys as a couple, and you in your choice of partner. You also need to stand up to your mom so that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t think she can just do whatever to your loved ones.", "NTA. When it comes down to it, that is YOUR mother and YOU decide your relationship with her based on how she treats you and the people you love. Yes, your GF deserves to stick up for herself, but if they were already screaming at eachother that \u201cconversation\u201d wasn\u2019t going anywhere productive. Your Gf is totally off base on why your mom doesn\u2019t respect her and doesn\u2019t understand nothing she does is going to change that. No way I\u2019d stand back and just let my parent and partner scream at eachother.", "NTA.\r  \n\r  \nSorry but Mia needs to accept that no matter what she says, your mother will not actually HEAR her points (or any point) unless it means enough to you to step in.  Speaking from experience here, unfortunately.  When a conversation goes from just that to yelling, time for you to step in, regardless of what was said before.", "I can see why Mia would be pissed, but all you really did was hear a commotion, go towards it, and your mum spoke to you directly, and you responded accordingly.\n\nI think this would only come down to how you and Mia communicate what had happened. She's right to be mad, although there isn't a need for it.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA. The fight is also about you and that's your mom", "I understand where Mia is coming from, and in some respects she is right.  But she is forgetting MILs position that no person is ever going to be good enough for her son and the only person who can set your mother  straight is you.\n\nIf your mother is anything like my MIL, you need to have a serious word with her about your relationship.  My husband set his mother straight vey early on in our relationship, probably in the region of 35 years ago.  MIL continued to trash talk me until about a a year ago, what changed the situation is that she suddenly realised that she is getting old and I am the only person who will to make any effort to sort out Power of Attorney, for her and FIL which will save them \u00a31000s.  I don't give an sh1t about my in-laws.  Their well-being and comfort is of zero interest to me.  I do care about husband and making his life easier.   \n\nTell you mother to reel it in.  Mia is your partner, you chose her.  Your mothers opinion is irrelevant.  If your mother wants to be part of your life, newsflash Mia is a bigger part of your life.  Odds are you will spend more hours, days, weeks, months and years with Mia than you have with your mother.\n\nPlease stand up for your girlfriend.   Please teach your mother boundaries.", "I call AH because when she needed it, you disempowered her. You could have stood by in support but you jumped in when she specifically told you to stay out of it.\n\nWhile meaning is good the execution sucks. YTAH from me on that point alone.", "NTA. You weren't standing up for your gf, you were standing up for yourself. Your mom brought you into it.", "NTA and neither is your girlfriend, your Mom is horrid.", "NAH\n\nMia was handling it and you were not injecting yourself into their argument.  Then your mother tried to draw you in. You did the only \u201csuccessful\u201d thing you could. Support your gf, shut down your mom, and draw a firm boundary", "Your mother attacked your GF in your presence.  That\u2019s as much an attack on you as it is on her, and you had every right to step in.  I\u2019d go so far as to say you had a duty.\n\nNTA", "Yeah I've gone NC on my mom because of how she treats me and my daughters....  NTAH.", "I feel bad that Mia thinks that if she fought her own battles his mom would respect her... No, in this case not at all.", "I think it's also worth pointing out\n\n>My mom then asked what I saw in some \"floozy\"\n\ndoes a few things. Up until this point he's just run in to see what the fuss is about. But now not only is *his* decision making etc. being called into question, he is literally being asked a direct question. What is he meant to do? Just let Mia start listing off all the reasons she's great and answering for him?", "That was my thought too. As soon as she asked \"What could you possibly see in a floozy like her?\", OP was kind of obligated to respond. If he had just thrown up his hands and stayed out of it, it would look like tacit agreement. He was kind of damned if you do (GF doesn't want him stepping in) and damned if you don't (it would look like he *had* no good reasons to be with her)", "This should be higher!", "\u201cRuined some work\u201d? No therapist worth a dime would have encouraged Mia to stay in that screaming match with OP\u2019s mom. Mia needed to disengage which is also a skill she should be learning in therapy.", "Also, his mother asked OP what he saw in some \"floozy.\" I think at that point he needed to say what he said. He wasn't defending Mia in the moment and not letting Mia take care of it herself. He was responding to the provocation thrown at him.", "OP, NTA.\n\nMom addressed you and you responded that her disrespectful behavior was not only inappropriate, but you will not tolerate it. Ever. Kudos for setting boundaries then & there. \n\nMom not giving any reply to \u201crespect my GF or I\u2019ll go NC\u201d. Then go NC. Maybe when she realizes you\u2019re serious, she\u2019ll have a change of heart and mind. Maybe not. The choice is hers. \n\nMia could have done nothing that might. She was in a no win situation with mom. \nI hope she can discuss this with her therapist and get an objective opinion on what happened.\n\nAll the best to you and Mia.", "You need to refer Mia to r/justnoMIL", "Your mother has a plan for you, and it's obvious that Mia won't play ball, so mommy dearest is doing all she can to torpedo Mia.  Whatever the future brings, whether you and Mia stay together in the long term or not, you need to reject any and all attempts on your mother's part to interfere in your love life.", "when both of you have mellowed down i would talk to her about revisit the situation and tell her that the issue is between your mom and you and she's being dragged into it. you respect that she wants to stand up for herself and you give her the space to do so but there is a limit to which you can idly stand by and say/do nothing.\n\n\ntry to be calm when talking and don't get heated about it. i had a similar issue with my gf(now wife) and we would get into long fights cause of something i said/did in front of either of our parents and vice versa. something i did after 7 years was clearing the air cause we would usually just shrug the issue aside after going at each others throats for a while. I honestly wish i had known how to do this 7 years ago, missed out on a lot of special occasions cause we weren't meeting due to a fight. It's been amazing since then."]}
