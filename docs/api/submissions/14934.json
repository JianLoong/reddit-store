Usually Mia doesn't join me, but this year my entire extended family was visiting and she wanted to meet some of my cousins. She told me very specifically that she wanted to be the one to handle her problems with my mom. \n\nThe family gathering was going really well, I was having a beer with my cousin who I hadn't seen in a couple years and no drama to speak of up to that point. Then I heard my mom yelling. I ran towards the commotion and saw my mom and Mia arguing. Mia saw me and said stay out of it but I could see she was holding back tears. My mom then asked what I saw in some \"floozy\" (yes really) and that's when I stepped in. A bit of back and forth arguing lead lead to me giving my mom an ultimatum: either accept that I love Mia and treat her with respect, or I go NC. Still haven't gotten a response on that.\n\nWe left and bought a hotel room for the rest of the trip. In the car, Mia was really angry and said that my mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't get a chance to fight her own battles.

But this is different.  This is about you and your relationship with your mother, equally to your mother's relationship with Mia.  \n\nSo NAH\n\nMia is right to feel that you stepped on her autonomy because you did, but she's also failing to recognize that your history and relationship with your mother and THAT relationship, color this interaction.  \n\nYou get a pass solely because it's your mother.  If this were ANYONE else, you'd be the complete asshole.", "NTA: OP, Mom addressed you. At that point you became my involved. At that point, the topic of discussion became your concern.", "NTA. Mia is under the delusion that your mom doesn't respect her because she doesn't stand up for herself.\n\nThe reality is that there is nothing she could do to earn your mother's respect. Because your mom is the problem which you are very aware of. \n\nThe reality is that your mother will always find something wrong with anyone you date because she views these partners as obstacles to you. I can't fault you for calling your mom out on her bullshit which really has nothing to do with Mia and everything to do with your mother being emotionally incestuous.", "NAH except your mom.   Your mom directed her comment to you.   That couldn\u2019t go unanswered but Mia needs to be able to deal with her directly as well", "NTA. When your mom asked what you saw in some \"floozy\", you responded by defending **yourself**. Mia cannot reasonably ask  you to refrain from doing that.", "I struggled with this when I was learning to have my own voice (like Mia is doing). My therapist showed me that I can have my own voice whilst being in a partnership. Having your own voice and learning to stand up for yourself doesn\u2019t mean having to do everything alone. \n\nI used to get angry if anyone helped me because of my want to prove I could do it alone, so my husband worked out a neat thing that works for me - he asks if he can be my partner in this or can he be with me in this. \n\nIn this circumstance, he would say \u2018I\u2019m with Hamigakiko mum. We are partners in this.\u2019 \n\nIt means Mia is still fighting her battles, but you are giving a very clear message to your mother that you stand together and she cannot break you apart. \n\nYou can then after follow up with your boundaries to your mother. \n\nHave a talk with your gf about how you want to support her but some of your life battles (like this one) do involve you both. Yes, she was attacking Mia, but she (mother) was also attacking you by taking away your agency to choose a life partner and crossing your boundaries, so you do have a right to fight that battle to. \n\nI would encourage you both to look at the grey rock method too. Seldom does it work with people like your mother to fight - to them, as soon as you fight - they have already won. \n\nNAH", "NTA, two things can be right at the same time, it's right for you to defend Mia and it's right for her to defend herself.  Your fight: your mother should respect your choices and mia's: your mother should respect her as a person.", "NTA. I get that Mia wants to fight her own battles, but it's also important to support each other in conflicts, especially when it involves your family members. I think it would have been much worse if you just stood on the sidelines when your own mother is treating Mia like that.\n\nAlso, your mother asked you a question directly, involving you in the dispute. Are you just supposed to stay quiet after that? At that point you are now involved and it isn't just Mia's battle to fight.", "NAH, your girlfriend has every right to want to stand up for herself and not wanting you to swoop in to her defence. But also, the way I see it, while your mom is targeting your gf, she's also creating problems for you by doing that and you have every right to set boundaries with you could you have picked a better moment to do it? Yes, probably, bit I I understand both why you did and why your gf is angry\n\nEdit: No AHs except for mom ofc", "NAH - I get where Mia is coming from, but you will always kind of have some sort on involvement in disagreements with your mom, as she\u2019s your mom? I also think you were not just standing up for Mia, but standing up for yourself as well to try and put an end to confrontation like this occurring. \nBut I would have a chat with her about this to try and make amends, as she absolutely wanted to try and resolve this issue on her own you have, even if unintentionally, undermined that. I would cut out your mom though, that seems to be far more stress than it\u2019s worth.", ">\teither accept that I love Mia and treat her with respect, or I go NC.

Your girlfriend needs to realise your a team and you need to sort out your mother", "I see how Mia wanted to be proactive but disagree with her. It's your mother, you should be the one to tell her not to treat Mia badly. Standing back and saying nothing might make your mother think you either don't care or side with her instead of Mia.", "NTA-everything I heard or ever read says the BF or husband should deal with his own family and vice versa. It's unreasonable for her to ask you not to stand up for her..with your own family.", "NTA. Obviously there is no reasoning with your mother. Go NC until she agrees to respect Mia.", "nta - becuase your mom asked and gave the ultimatium and your responded from your heart.", "You do need to sincerely apologise to Mia for not being able to do what she asked. \n\nHowever\u2026 Your mom involved you, and challenged you, and you had to respond somehow to that. It\u2019s important your mom sees the two of you as united and mutually supportive. Standing up to your mom - as you both have seen now - makes no difference to how she behaves, and it is not acceptable. You gave your mom an ultimatum, and the right one too. Her behaviour is a choice she persists in making and there need to be consequences for that. Going NC needed to come from you, and had the most impact that way. Mia going NC is pretty clearly what your mom wants.\n\nWhat would have been a better plan would be for you and Mia to have a strategy, so if things were going south like this, or your mom dragged you into it, you\u2019d both agreed on what you should do and say. In the circumstances, it went the only way it could.\n\nNTA, but apologise and reassure her that nothing matters more to you than how she feels and what she wants, but you were put in an impossible situation.

It would be humiliating and embarrassing for your girlfriend if you had not stood up for her. Appreciate that your girlfriend feels unheard, but explain that your intentions were genuine.

You didn't defend mia. You defended your relationship. You didn't do anything when your mom berated her. You stepped in when it was about your life.", "NTA I do believe that you should have stayed out of it and let Mia handle it but I understand why you defended her, it would be very difficult to say nothing. Ideally you should have spoken to your mother afterwards.", "As much as few people would like to argue against you stepping in , I think this has more to do with you who shares close relationship with the person verbally attacking your partner , you did alot of help stepping in between them , honestly English isn't my first language and I had to search it up what sloozy actually meant , your mother has no respect for your relationships and boundaries and its your own job to handle the problem regarding your mother ,  your girlfriend is an introvert who will just end up getting hurt and let people like your own mother walk all over her , if it was a stranger then it would be a bit too much for you to step in and give off stereotypical white knight vibe , but that person is your mother and ofc you have everything to do with the issue .", "Nah yes she asked you to  stay out of it but your mom was straight up verbally abusing your gf.  There's a difference between fighting your own battles and having a screaming match in the kitchen.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't respect Mia because she doesn't want to. If this were a situation with a friend or a stranger then you jumping in would be an asshole move. But this is your mother. This is quite frankly all about her relationship with you and has very little to do with Mia.", "On every single MIL post, people complain their SOs don't stand up for them. I understand where she's coming from but it's sooo much better here that you said something.", "NTA This was your battle too. Your mom was questioning your choice in women. \n\nMia may not understand because she\u2019s a non-confrontational person who wouldn\u2019t have responded to a similar inquiry from her own mother. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to let it slide with your own mother.", "NTA since she told you to handle her problems with your mom. And also because your mom saying you were with a floozy was your issue with your mom, your mom was attacking your choice of partner so you can defend your choice to your mom without it being a situation where you were fighting Mia's battle. You were fighting your own, which was your mom saying you picked a bad partner and you disagreed. You can fight your mom when it comes to her disagreeing with you, which is what it was.", "Two separate issues.\n\nFirst, your mother - you don\u2019t need a reply from her about your ultimatum.

Mia is an adult: don't coddle her, don't treat her like a child who needs to be defended. She is able to express her opinion and handle the situation (there's a difference between defending your girlfriend from your mom's meanness and not giving Mia the chance to do it herself). It's enough for you to stay by Mia's side. It's okay to tell your mom that you don't tolerate her attitude, but don't speak up for your girlfriend. She has a voice and knows how to use it.\n\n\\- You have issues with your mom which probably go beyond Mia. Understandable, but perhaps you are projecting and take advantage of the tense situation between your mother and Mia to jump on the wagon and discuss YOUR issues with your mother.

I know that you had the best of intentions, but it sounds like your mum had been treating Mia pretty terribly for a while, right? This doesn\u2019t sound like new behavior and it sounds like Mia had really put a lot of work in to try tackle it. \n\nIt also sounds like your mum then used your presence in the conversation as a way to further attack Mia. Is that also normal behavior from her?

This is more for her than for your mother, your mother may never respect her, but Mia needs to know she can respect herself, and it seems a lot of that is tied up in being able to stand on her own two feet. She might cry, and it will be hard to watch, but she can get through it and honestly it's only going to make your mom look bad for making someone cry at something meant to be a fun family function, but at least Mia will know she can stand up for herself, and that will be a win for her.", "Best of luck OP you have some tough working out to do with your partner, it takes two to make this work, and hopefully your both become stronger for it, and maybe one day your mother can accept she was wrong, and love you both.\n\nNAH", "The only a h here is your mom.

In fact her \u201cstanding up for herself\u201d only resulted in your mother escalating the drama into a loud commotion and from her \u201cfloozy\u201d comment showed your mother did not increase her respect for Mia at all.", "NAH\n\nThat said, your mom involved you and you laid it out to mom in no uncertain terms.

I can open up in maybe how she feels a bit as I was also in a long term relationship from a young age with severe anxiety over what my future MIL thought of me.\n\n1 You may want to consider that there might be something shes working on with her counselor and fighting her personal battles. \n\n2 You need to reassure her that your moms way of thinking isn't related to her directly. You can't change people who feel this way, but if she's thinking of marrying you then she may want a strong solid relationship with her before proceeding.\n\n3 This was my personal experience, but my ex husband's mom accuses me of stealing him away from his family saying I had no right. It caused me such grief that I just avoid his family any chance I get. Even though I paid his rent for 4 years working 2 jobs while he went to school I was also viewed as not good enough. It messes with your mind. I promise you she is unwell and there were times I also stuck up for myself, but ultimately your family will \"side\" with you no matter what. She may not understand that last part yet.\n\n4 Floozy ? How can you call someone that after they've been in a long term committed relationship? You absolutely did what any sane person would do.", "OP while I am also leaning towards NAH (between you and Mia, not your mother- holy AH on that one) I think maybe going forward with this specific situation, you could explain to Mia that you weren\u2019t fighting HER battle with your mother. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that\u2019s what you were trying to do in any way. Your mother did involve you, and you reacted to that. While I see how Mia took it as you trying to come to her rescue, it would feel that way after asking you to not involve yourself in her confrontations, you were specifically asked a question in the argument. Had you said nothing, your mother would have turned to Mia and said much worse than she already did. \u201cSEE? He has no answer, no reason for you to be in OUR lives.\u201d I\u2019m sure it would be with uglier words but, it would have surely turned into you having no reason for burdening your poor mother with having to deal with this useless, awful woman! Poor mommy! Having to have another woman in her son\u2019s life, meaning her life!? Obviously (SO sarcastically) the worst thing that could ever happen to HER! \n\nIf Mia wants to confront your mother again, I think before you leave (if you haven\u2019t already) it would be very cathartic for her to do so. If you choose to do this, a conversation should be had on how to go about it. Personally, I think as a team would be best - if Mia can see that you are not fighting her battles but your combined battle. If this relationship is going to last long term, this thing with your mother should be fought together. Her fighting alone will never amount to anything that your mother takes seriously, and I hope she can see that. While it\u2019s understandable that your mother took an overprotective outlook on her son after losing her husband, this is the highest level of unhealthy. Your mother needs a hard reality check on what is okay and what is not. You are your own person, you are of age to be making your own family with the woman you choose to spend your forever with - your mother is not an insider in that family. \n\nMaybe suggest to Mia that you have a final conversation with your mother, have her (Mia) speak her mind - anything and everything she has to say to your mother about how she treats her and your relationship.. but start that conversation with you stating that you support her in what she says, how she feels, and how she wants things to go moving forward, rather than interjecting in the heat of the moment.

I would have been the one leading if the situation was reversed and my mom was causing the problem. \n\nI am also a very non-confrontational person by nature, so I know it\u2019s a big deal to stick up for yourself.

Yeah the mother would see this as a triumph over the gf. \n\nBut I also feel for Mia. She works on standing up for herself so this was probably quite a success for her at the beginning - the fact that they got into a shouting match proves that was not taking it.

Him defending himself when his mum turns around on him isn't him jumping to her defence even if it ends to the same effect.\n2.

Your mom attacking Mia is also your mom attacking your life choices. 2) that one particular fight was going nowhere. Once you start crying, there's little chances you're going to establish anything with a borderline abusive MIL and finally 3) there's also the very concrete chance that no matter what Mia does or says your mom is never going to respect her because in fact she has no issues with her specifically.

But there is more here happening than just Mia's issues.  Your mother isn't someone that is going to be convinced to change her wrong attitudes or behaviors, by someone standing up to her.  She's someone, like my MIL, who takes things to extremes to try to force compliance.  \n\nCheck out those other subs, for lots of posts and comments that can help you to see how to stand firm to the boundary you set, and how to protect yourselves from someone dysfunctional, not normal.

Now Mia is mad because she didn\u2019t get to continue \u201csticking up for herself\u201d.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just how I was raised, but yelling back is not sticking up for yourself, and that just makes you stoop to AHs level. She should have just told her \u201cwe are not dealing with this now\u201d and left the room. To get mad at the OP for sticking up to HIS mom for the both of them blows my mind. I understand that she wanted to be the one to do it, but at the same time, she wasn\u2019t doing it in a productive or healthy manner. She would have caused a scene that could have potentially caused more issues with the family, so the OP stepping in was honestly for the best.\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that she is angry at the OP that moves her to the slight AH category. I understand being upset, but anger is too much.", " agree with so NTA\n\nBut OP, but to have handled it better you should have let your GF handle", "I love this.", "And Mia cannot reasonably ask OP not to deal with *his* mom", " If she wants to learn to stand up for herself, great, she should, but she also cannot be upset when the person she is standing up to is his mom, not hers. My parents never overstep that boundary.", "I've already read a great deal about it and worked through a lot of issues that resulted from it (not to say I'm perfect or that it doesn't still affect me). I'm well aware of how my mother sees me and why she doesn't like Mia, but thank you for the resource regardless and I hope that someone who needs it, sees it", "The moment his mom addressed *him* it became his responsibility to give a United front", "That's really easy for you to say, but consider the fact that, despite my mom's flaws, she is still the woman who raised me. Maybe it was na\u00efve to think that she'd be able to get over herself and accept the woman I love, but I don't want to just cut out someone who means a lot to me. I truly do believe that my mom loves me and wants the best for me, she just can't express that in a healthy way. I will go NC if that's what's necessary to protect Mia, but I really want to keep what little family I have in my life. If that makes me an asshole in your eyes, I respect that opinion, but not everyone is just able to cut someone out of their lives so easily.", "That does not happen all of the time.", "Just so you know no response is a response.", "Yeah, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to magically bond after screaming at each other. OP\u2019s mom hates Mia and doesn\u2019t care about her opinions.", "He absolutely was stepping into her fight, though, because by his own account, he ran over and inserted himself into it.", "Me too! I could understand her getting a little upset, but the fact she got mad at him was ridiculous to me. I think the OP did the right thing because it was his mom, not Mia\u2019s. If it was Mia\u2019s mom, it wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate. I also understand wanting to stand up for yourself, but the way Mia was standing up for herself wasn\u2019t it. Doing it at a family gathering, and yelling at each other is not appropriate. She should have just been like \u201cI don\u2019t have time for your nonsense\u201d and ignored her for the rest of the night.", "How you are raised doesn't apply to how other people were raised or interact. Some people have grand old shouting matches at every family event because that's how they were raised and would look at you like you were crazy if you said there was anything wrong with it.  \n\nDifferent strokes.  That's why \"emotional abuse\" is so hard to define.   While there are definite instances, I know people who claim to be emotionally abused if their partner ever raises their voice.  Which is, IN MY OPINION, according to what * I* consider abusive, horseshit.  Raising a voice is not abuse.  But if you feel that's abusive, don't be with someone who is loud.  Everyone has a different barometer of \"acceptable interaction\" and what's right for you, is not necessarily right for everyone.", "Yeah pretty much this, and what OP did was much better that not saying anything at all. I would\u2019ve also snapped, can\u2019t blame him. Except maybe for getting him and his GF into this situation.", "That\u2019s very sad. I hope your mom realizes that she has to respect and honour your choices if she wants you in her life. If you go NC, I suggest writing her a heartfelt letter explaining this to her, and that she has a choice to make about having you in her life or not. I hope she sees the light and chooses to respect your choices, and Mia.", "You need to! You know this. She is abusing you and Mia, and you are letting her do it.", "If things were going south like this, or your mom dragged you into it, you\u2019d both agreed on what you should do and say. In the circumstances, it went the only way it could.", "It's also a fairly common term in the southern US for a woman who has multiple partners (to put it diplomatically). My mom and her sisters as well as their female friends used it, though I have rarely heard a man say it.", "\u201cI meant it in relation to my mom specifically.\u201d\n\nExactly this! Your mother caused and single-handedly created a tipping point in your relationship, and you pushed back. You weren\u2019t coming in hot looking for cheers of \u201cAll hail the mighty hero!\u201d Believe me, no matter how Mia may have stood up to her, it wouldn\u2019t have made one iota of difference in mom\u2019s mean and hateful comments or behavior. \n\nNow, **if** you were to defend Mia and get involved in a dispute with her boss or professor, etc., you absolutely would be TA. But that\u2019s not even close to the reality here. Your mother verbally abused your GF (by extension, you) and you \u201ccorrected\u201d her. Go NC, because her lack of response to that ultimatum from you is all the answer you need to move forward. Good luck.", "Exactly. Mia can\u2019t win whatever she does or who she is. This is not about Mia not being able to stand up for herself. She can do that till the cows come home but it\u2019s not going to make a blind bit of difference as long as he\u2019s with someone his mother didn\u2019t set him up with she\u2019s never going to be liked! Even if she didn\u2019t have to work on her confrontation when they met she\u2019d be hated more because the mother would complain she\u2019s rude she argues with me everytime!", "What do you think he should have done instead?", "Just go NC, I doubt your mother will ever behave herself. And if she does learn to behave by some miracle, a lengthy timeout would benefit everyone.", "If?  You need to go NC period. Your mom has and will always harass Mia. If you truly love her you would never place her in that situation!", "No he didn't. He heard his mum yelling, he goes over to see what the hell she's yelling about this time. Sees his gf arguing with her, gf tells him \"stay out of it.\" So he does.\n\nMother dearest is the one who drags him into it by seeing him there and directing an insult at him", " It would be humiliating and embarrassing for your girlfriend if you had not stood up for her.", "My mom actually did try to set me up with a couple of girls in high school, and they were - pardon my french - batshit insane. Mia's the first woman in my life who's actually acknowledged I'm a person, not a puppet or servant. I'm glad I saw the situation for what it was at the time but this comment hit me hard", "Op was defending his GF and himself.  It\u2019s 100% good to stand up for your GF.  I don\u2019t think you did it because you thought your GF needed you to do it but because you saw how hurt she was by your mother and you care about her deeply.  People try to turn your reaction into something misogynistic like you as a man have to step in for your girl as a \u201chero\u201d.  Not everything a guy does for a girl is bad.  Good on you for standing up for your GF and yourself", "I'm not sure why PansyPeople thinks you're trying to portray yourself as a hero here. Pretty damn strange. I didn't interpret your post that way at all.", "I didn\u2019t take it that way but you kind of are. I respect what you did. I think if you said nothing, it would be worse, which you realized. It was a lose lose situation for you. I hope mia sees that.", "No, YTA a because you e allowed this to go for many years. Go NC with your mother. You know it.", "And how is that not exactly what I said?  Was he obligated to go, by his own words \"running\" over when he head his mother yelling? No. He could have stayed and drank his beer with his cousin.  \n\nHe inserted himself.", "this", "Make sure she knows this, she\u2019s powerful and respected but in that case there was no winning. Your mother was using her to test you, and you stopped it at the first instance. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t I could imagine it going on for years. No matter what she does it won\u2019t be enough for your mother, there is no winning down that path.", "Stop contacting your mother. Otherwise YTA", "OP\u2019s mom will never respect his GF because his mom doesn\u2019t think of him as grown man and therefore doesn\u2019t respect him and his autonomy in that capacity. \nUntil she can respect OP as his own man, she\u2019ll always believe she has a say in who he dates, and that her opinion holds more weight in his life than her sons own opinion does. Because she doesn\u2019t see him as a person with his own autonomy, he\u2019s her little boy\u2026 and that\u2019s her problem to deal with or have it dealt with for her, it would seem, as OP wasn\u2019t afraid of laying down the \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d/no contact boundary, and good on him for that. \n\nOP - what you did is commendable in a very tough situation, in a way it was lose-lose, if you\u2019d let your mom and GF argue it out you\u2019re giving up your own agency in your decisions on who you date as far as your mom is concerned, and by intervening when called for, it\u2019s upset your GF because she told you to stay out of it beforehand. But she couldn\u2019t know the way your mom would approach the argument would be to drag her son into it and call his decision making and his status as an adult into question, thereby dragging you into it. Honestly I think you would have been ta if you hadn\u2019t gotten involved. Sometimes you\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. But in this case, I think you did what was best for yourself and your GF. Honestly, long term, and what\u2019s best for your mom too. She needs to be reminded that if she wants access to the grandkids she needs to have a good relationship with the daughter in law. \n\nThe thing is the way they\u2019re all telling you to look at it is pretty much spot on. You were defending yourself, your relationship and your boundaries. Not just riding in as a white night for your GF, which is likely all she is currently able to see (her perspective instead of the bigger picture). That and you not respecting her boundaries (while that\u2019s true it\u2019s a very nuanced situation, and in this case it was called for).\nBut that\u2019s an emotional response, which she\u2019s entitled to, and when she\u2019s calm enough, try explaining that your mom was doing a lot more than just arguing with her at the point you had to step in, and that not stepping in to take up the fight to your family when your GF, your adulthood and your boundaries were all being disrespected by your mom would have been disrespectful to her and to your relationship, and could have started a pattern of behaviour with your mom that could have been catastrophic if allowed to carry on long term. It\u2019s a situation best nipped at the bud, which is what you were doing, not trying to step over her being assertive of herself, not diminishing her own agency\u2026 and don\u2019t forget to tell her you\u2019re proud of her for taking the fight to your mom\u2026 because it was very brave. But also find a way to explain that on the whole, it\u2019s not her job to deal with your family\u2019s negative behaviour, that a United front lead by you is how you both deal with negative behaviour from your family.\n\n\nTL;DR OP - you did good, and your GF is emotional at the moment (and it\u2019s not surprising). Make sure you acknowledge that, tell her you\u2019re proud of her and that when you jumped it in was because it was your job to take the fight to your family, that it was your problem when your mom questioned your place as a man, and your decision making. Because of this, while you acknowledge she asked you to stay out of it before hand, it wasn\u2019t possible or fair to her to stand mute while your mom used you as a weapon against her. \n\n\n\nGood luck OP, you seem like a good dude and like you understand better than most how your parents while significant in your life, cannot carry more weight than the person you choose as your partner. Nor can you accept poor treatment and disrespect of yourself or your partner from your family. \nI hope you can have a good talk with your GF and hopefully sort it out. I\u2019m a fairly quiet type myself and had to work on being assertive. Tell her it is achievable with some hard work. As a side note, she may benefit from some kind of therapy to deal with reasons why she struggles to stand up for herself.", "Yes, OP is NTA.  He tried his best in a no-win situation.", "I never thought I'd see the day that multiple redditors would say that a guy ignoring his partner and drinking beer is the correct solution to a problem", "what the fuck kind of person are you that you know your gf and mom don;t like each other, you hear them yelling at each other and you just ignore it? even if your intent is to stay out of it, you go over to make sure your gf is alright if you know your mother is abusive. you don't just go \"well I know mom is shitty and I know GF has an issue with standing up for herself, but im just gonna be over here ignoring it all pretending like everything is ok\"", "This is the point - treating your partner with respect and considering their feelings, is not doing anything admirable or is something that deserves recognition. I won't congratulate you for saying your not a hero but i wanted to say it was nice to read.", "YTA", "But he *didn't* ignore it, and now some commenters are accusing him of getting involved in an argument that wasn't his. Except he didn't involve himself, his mother dragged him into it by insulting him as well as his gf - he was letting his gf handle things herself as she had asked, until Mommy Dearest turned on him. Mommy Dearest seems to be a nasty piece of work and the sooner OP and his gf go fully NC with her the better.", "My little brother's first marriage failed, for many reasons", "Despite his mother!"]}
