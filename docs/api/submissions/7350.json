Doesn't excuse the behavior but measuring food is a control thing and it's perfectly okay for you to be uncomfortable there. I'm not sure either of your body types but maybe she's wanting you around to feel better about herself...this is all just guessing but as someone who had an ED it sounds very familiar", "NTA I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to tell her. Also who the fuck keeps a lock on their freezer that\u2019s wild. I think it would have been better if you had at least been honest with your mom because she could have stepped in and talked with your sister. But your sister is weird for keeping a lock on the freezer", "NTA, they backed you into a corner. No good ever comes from bullying someone into something they have said, multiple times, they don't want to do.", "NTA.  Freezer with a lock?  Um, no, no, you're not required to want to be somewhere that you can't eat, and frankly your sister sounds mentally unwell - and telling you that you should be grateful for any food at all and you're wrong for not wanting to go someplace where food is being withheld?  Again, that's... mentally unwell.", "NTA I do think you could have handled this better but you are also a teen in a weird situation so it was a reasonable choice you made to just find another, neutral reason not to visit. Personally would have told a parent what was happening so that 1) you could be reimbursed, 2) they might look into getting your sister help (because this isn\u2019t typical behavior), and 3) the parent might have had your back and preemptively helped when your sister started asking for visits again.", "NTA\n\nAnnie, your sister, completely fails the most basic rule of being a host.  You ensure your guests have enough to eat.  \n\nWhile food costs have gone up drastically, that's not your problem.  Nor is it your problem if money is tight for Annie.   If these are concerns, she needs to ask other adults for financial help, not treat you like a burden.   \n\nPut simply, Annie should have asked your mom directly and not gotten you involved.  How she handled this concern was total AH territory.", "NTA-Your sister should have paid attention when you were honest with her the first time.  She ignored you and when you brought it up again, she was probably embarrassed and lashed out. Your mom seems to be the peacemaker in the family trying to come up with solutions. You said no and they need to respect that.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to hurt your sisters feelings, but cracked under the pressure. Does you sister live by herself and keep her freezer locked? Does she eat normal sized meals?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 17, you are not a kid to be \"sent over\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to block your sister's number.", "NTA\n\nBut Annie got her disordered eating directly from your mother. \n\nChildren (boys & girls) eat. They need the calories. Putting locks on food is a form of control and abuse.", "So NTA, but you could have better dealt with this situation. You should have told your mom why and what's going on. Not only would she have given you money for food she could help address your sister's probable eating disorder. Your sister's explosion was definitely uncalled for, and she is in the wrong here, but was it because she got defensive when you said she has no food in her fridge. Basically calling out her eating disorder in an aggressive manner (I mean that lightly) and not saying it from a place of caring. Again, you're not the AH, but your sister's reaction was huge (and uncalled for). She should absolutely apologize to you, but if she feels singled out she might not until she gets help for her problems first. Hopefully your mom can talk to her and have a heart to heart. Your sister sounds like she loves you and wants to spend time with you and I hope this doesn't irreparably damage your relationship.*\n\n*Another possibility is that she wants you over so she can control your diet too. If that's the case then I take back anything nice I said about your sister. She still probably has an eating disorder, but that's shitty trying to pushing it on someone else. Her wanting to spend time with you wouldn't be coming from a place of love rather than that of control.", "NTA  Your sister has a very unhealthy relationship with food.  You need to stay where food is available to you.", "NTA. Yeah I would not want to go to her house either. Locking the fridge and measuring what was removed.

The money comment makes me think she might be struggling financially but she's too ashamed to admit it.

It's weird to try to force you to stay with her.", "NTA, but you dealt with the situation poorly.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your sister is trying to stealth-diet you.

Your mom might be thinking the same but it might be worth it to show concern about the possibility of it. ED can cause so many health issues and if she's all alone she could be in danger.", "Unless you are 2\u20196, 166lb is not overweight.", "I feel like there\u2019s definitely a less abusive way to teach moderation to children", "That certainly explains why your sister most likely has an eating disorder", "Do you have any idea what you're talking about? I'm 5'0\" and I was considered firmly overweight when I was ~130 lbs. I felt and looked it, too.", "That's not true. Overweight is defined as a bmi of 25-30. For 166 lbs anyone between 5'3\" and 5'8\" would be overweight. Anything below 5'3\" is obese. 2'6\" would be severe obesity.", "It's not like we couldn't have anything but we'd just need her permission and since my brothers wouldn't listen she had to install a lock. For my sister there isn't even anything in the firdge", "There are plenty of people in the obese category who\u2019s body type do not align with that chart.", "How is your sister 27 with nothing in the fridge. Damn. Is it a money thing?", "I mean.. growing boys (and girls) need food. And yogurt isn\u2019t exactly as major cause of obesity.  Your mother may have given your sister a complex around food - systematically denying food to hungry kids is abusive.  Was it only the yogurt she denied them ?", "Like it or not, that's literally the medical definition.", "Idk, I'm 28 and live alone so I don't have a full fridge. I can't eat that much food before it goes bad. I usually just go to the store every day and buy what I need then.", "I mean, I\u2019m 34 with an empty fridge but that\u2019s because I have horrible habits and eat out a lot. If she is just with an empty fridge and isn\u2019t bringing prepared food in\u2026I think she is choosing to not eat and I don\u2019t think it is an adulting/laziness issue so much as behavior indicative of a disorder", "The BMI was created by an astronomer & statistician in 1830, who never trained in medicine, with numbers based solely on conscripted white men to the Belgium army. \n\nHis goal wasn't even for health. It was to see what the 'average man' looked like on a population level. And he took his info from the only government documentation available. Thus only army conscripts were considered. \n\nThere is zero logical reason for this to be used in medicine today. That's why SO MANY who are 'healthy' - such as athletes, POC like The Rock, women and babies are considered obese/ unhealthy by this scale. It wasn't made to be used this way.\n\nPlease try not to use this argument again. It is an outdated and flawed methodology that is taking its sweet time to die because the people getting rich off the diet industry won't let it.", "Then the medical condition needs to change, because that's a wildly inaccurate and imprecise definition/criteria. My brother would be considered \"obese.\" He lives in the gym and eats fairly healthy. He's not roidy, but he has very little fat. I had an eating disorder and never got below 18 because of my muscle mass. Any doctor who looks solely at BMI to label someone as obese doesn't have a lick of common sense.", "BMI is not a \"medical definition\" but an approximation of what some old French dude thought the ideal white guy should be like. It's like putting importance on a Meyers Briggs score; made up hokum.", "I mean that\u2019s understandable if it\u2019s just yourself. I also have an eating disorder but to not at least provide her sister with food is weird", "  I never claimed BMI was the way obesity **should** be judged. It's the way it **is** judged. I agree that it's a flawed system, but most others are extremely subjective.", "I agree.   In med school they always stress that BMI is terrible as a sole criterion for obesity.  It's useful data to have, but context absolutely matters.", "Take a second to Google \"medical definition of obesity\"  I agree that it's imprecise and not a good sole criterion, but it absolutely  is the definition.", "I agree that it is weird to not feed a guest, but the tone of the comment I\u2019m replying to is that this is an issue of being irresponsible at the age of 27 - I\u2019m pointing out that it is probably a mental health issue which is ageless.", "I appreciate your thoughts! But nothing will change if people keep quoting it or arguing in favor of flawed logic. \n\nThere is no argument here for what category a woman's height and weight does or does not make her obese as the scale cannot, by creation, apply to women. \n\nQuoting those who are wrong doesn't make you right. Apply this to any other way we judge each other - be it race, sexual orientation, nationality, gender or religion. Quoting/arguing on the side of those who are wrong but are in the majority and it's just 'the way it is' doesn't make you right.", "The medical community is not immune to hokum.", "Nothing i do will change the definition. Feel free to tilt at windmills if you want, but I have better uses for my time.", "Not immune, but better than most fields.   Peer review really limits the bullshit that gets accepted.", "I'm confused are you spoiled for wanting to be fed?\n\n>her fridge is empty and the freezer has a lock on it from which she takes out things measured with a ruler\n\nWtf.\n\nNTA", "Nta- your sister definitely has some mental problems concerning food.  Hugs", "She...locks her freezer? And measures food...with a ruler? No, you are NTA, but your sister is weird. I wouldn't want to visit her, either.", "ED are no joke. Gave my aunt life-long health complications before she died at 60."]}
