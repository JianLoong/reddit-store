That is a great achievement. Your parents are definitely proud of you and so am I, this internet stranger. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nOnto the other daughter you mentioned-\nIt seems like she\u2019s jealous of your accomplishments and the fact that you\u2019re at a weight that\u2019s perfectly fine! I\u2019m 5\u20190 and I weigh 96lbs (43.5kg) and I\u2019m at a perfectly healthy weight. This is from all the doctors I\u2019ve seen for checkups and annuals.\n\nDON\u2019t let your awful family members EVER bring you down or shame you for your healthy weight or ever bash you for your achievements. You deserve better and you\u2019ll have a much more fulfilling, joyful, happy and successful life than they ever will with all the hard work and dedication you seem to be willing to put in. \n\nI wish you all the best! \ud83e\udd29", "NTA, good for you for standing up for yourself.  That side of your family sounds horrible to have to deal with.  I\u2019m sorry they shame you for what\u2019s out of your control.\n\nCongratulations on school!", "You shouldn't regret what you said. She asked for it.\n\nYour parents were wrong to admit these relatives to the party, though. At some point, enough is enough.\n\nNTA, and don't take any more abuse from them. When they attack, rip 'em a new one. \n\nBut if possible, you should go NC on them.", "If you don't regret what you said where is the conflict? \n\nNo matter if we go not TA or you're TA it doesn't matter to you, does it? \n\nPersonally I think your relatives are being obnoxious to constantly bodyshame you. You say your parents have your back. All good then. \n\nYou said what you said. You can't take it back anyways and seems like you also don't want to. \n\nWell you lead your life and try to avoid them.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re never the asshole when you\u2019re defending yourself against bullies.", "NTA. If poor little relative can go cry to mommy and mommy lashes out, your parents have every bit as much right to defend you and they need to put a stop to those comments instead of ignoring it. Or you know, verbally acknowledge that they agree with you. \u201cIf relative can dish it out, our daughter can too.

Also, r/rareinsults", "YTA for stooping to her level, but also for how you talk about your relatives & their weight. Calling someone fatter than you a pig is not classy or cute, especially if they\u2019re making fun of your body type. How are you any better than them when you call them pigs & parasites? I sincerely hope you grow out of this before you go to college & especially med school [if I\u2019m understanding this right]. Fix your attitude before someone else fixes it for you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it.", "You sound like you\u2019re from my country. First of all NTA. Relatives here are assholes. Body shaming, colour shaming, shaming in general is the norm. I am exactly your size but I gained a lot of weight due to health reasons in the past 2 years and I\u2019m for the first time 55kgs and the amount of comments I get is insane. I shut that shit down. I used to be an anxious quiet kid at 19 but I\u2019m 27 now so I put people in their place very nicely. Don\u2019t let them get to you. Shame then and lecture in public that will give them a taste of their own medicine. After a point it\u2019s going to stop at least in front of your face.", "Like the mods, YTA. Two wrongs don't make a right :) Forgive and forget, unlike some people here.", "Definitely NTA. She had it coming for insulting you even when you tried to avoid her. Plus, it\u2019s not like you can deal it with a little diet and exercise since it\u2019s more like a metabolic issue. \nAbout college, not everyone os destined to get to college and not everyone is destined to go to the same colleges. My childhood friend and I have medical-related courses (she\u2019s PT and I\u2019m a nurse) but we went to separate schools and we\u2019re not bitter over each other for everything.\nThat girl and your entire family are AH. I\u2019m glad you were born to good parents.", "NTA considering the provocation, but actually \"Oh darling - you keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better\" might actually be more effective and less easy to start family drama about. Because how dare you say what sounds like kindly and supportive things, right...?", "NTA, seems like the hairless pig family all has peanut-sized brains. Also, imagine her as a doctor? She'd probably tell everyone to get fat. Awful.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t say worse if that was me I would\u2019ve destroyed her self esteem and then shit on my other relatives fck that your relatives are terrible the next time they show up I\u2019d kick them out tell them they are not welcome the daughter was clearly incredibly jelous and used to getting her own way but good thing your parents are chill and got your back", "YTA. They are horrible, for sure.\n\n\"I have to respond to them in same way they treat me.\" - then you're the same as them. Just remember that.

Your response to the bullying is understandable, but more body shaming isn\u2019t the solution. Calling someone a pig is dehumanizing and the part of the problem is the extreme focus on how people\u2019s bodies look and the narrow range of what\u2019s seen as an acceptable body for a woman to exist in. The other part of the problem is overvaluing women\u2019s appearance and basing most of their social worth in how good they look. Your relative\u2019s vocal judgements on your body are cruel and you met that cruelty with more cruelty.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for yourself and that is a top tier insult.", "Thank you for your wishes ! My whole childhood was filled with body  insecurities and they all have been fueling it.
