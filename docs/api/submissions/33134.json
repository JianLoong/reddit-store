And I\u2019m sorry that you are experiencing pain from unresolved wounds. \n\nThat being said it\u2019s very important that you try to put away your conflicted feelings about your daughter\u2019s relationship with her Dad. \n\nYour daughter is an innocent. She didn\u2019t ask to be born. It\u2019s disordered and inappropriate for you to be jealous of her or resentful for ANY reason. I sense that you do not feel loved or valued; but that has NOTHING to do with your daughter. \n\nI want you to get help and support from a trauma-informed therapist to deal with the tremendous amount of pain inside of you. Do not look at your daughter and make comparisons to you or your life. Comparisons are evil in that they tend to make us feel badly about ourselves. \n\nYour daughter is at a very vulnerable age right now. She needs to know that you love her. I get that if you don\u2019t feel loved and have low self esteem it\u2019s difficult if not impossible for you to generate loving feelings towards her. But remember: she is not you. She is a separate person. Nobody can EVER take your unique place in her life. It is a privilege to be a mother. Whether you feel like it or not, you are privileged to be her Mom. \n\nShe is turning into a young adult. So it\u2019s important that you TRY to be a healthy person for her regardless of where you are right now in her life. \n\nSo plan to set apart some time to be with her. Ask her to go on a Mother Daughter Date with you. If you are in the States you could take her to a Barnes and Noble. Buy her a hot chocolate and a cupcake \ud83e\uddc1 in the cafe and let her pick out a book. \n\nMaybe reading and books could become a \u201cThing\u201d for you guys to enjoy together. My youngest daughter (24) and I enjoy collecting Nancy Drew Books to build up her collection. I love that she hasn\u2019t outgrown them. The Barnes and Noble or any other bookstore could become an annual thing for you guys. \n\nWhile you are enjoying your hot drinks ask her questions about her life: what she likes to read, her favorite subject in school. If you enjoy the exercise You could offer to take her ice skating \u26f8\ufe0f and then out for a hot meal afterwards. \n\nHere\u2019s my point. Your daughter isn\u2019t a brat. She\u2019s blessed by lots of love and attention from people who probably aren\u2019t a part of your life. I get that it\u2019s painful that you don\u2019t have those blessings right now and or the support you need to heal. But don\u2019t let the infection from those wounds spread to your daughter because you resent her happiness. \n\nLove is a Choice. As a daughter who was tormented by my Mom\u2019s failure to get help which has led to many chronic health problems\u2014-including Complex PTSD and Treatment Resistant Depression\u2014please do not inflict pain on your daughter. Ask God or a Higher Power\u2014to help you be the Mom that she needs. Ask Him to send people into your life to help you heal so the joy can come back to you and you can rise above your sadness and loss. \n\nGive yourself some credit. If your daughter is so delightful that she is celebrated by others who love her\u2014 well, she wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for you. Detach yourself from the painful emotions and enjoy the fact that she is happy and healthy. Choose to put away the poisonous resentment\u2014and forgive yourself for allowing your perceptions to become all distorted. Decide today that you are going to be a better Mom; and a healthier person. It\u2019s so important that we work through our pain and losses so they don\u2019t mess up our lives, health and relationships. \n\nSo figure out some options for celebrating one on one with your daughter. And decide to rise above your pain and not project it onto her. \n\nYou can do it!\n\nSo apologize to your daughter for upsetting her. And offer to do something one on one.", "What is wrong with people?? You think your daughter is spoiled and entitled because she wants to celebrate her birthday with her own mom?

You don\u2019t seem to be willing to do even the barest minimum for her birthday and the way you talk about her makes it sound like you don\u2019t even like her all that much.", "Good to know she would be right.  You don't have to spend money to show a child affection.   You are the one that is making it monetary and materialistic.  Not her, not her father.  You.  And that's shitty parenting.  I hope she lives with her dad and not you.", "You\u2019re missing an opportunity at a critical age to build a relationship and trust. It doesn\u2019t have to be ostentatious. Her favorite meal and a little celebration would demonstrate that you see her and you want to celebrate her. Doing nothing (seriously you won\u2019t even make her favorite meal?!?) is going to demonstrate that you just don\u2019t really care. And that is a big kind of hurt. You don\u2019t have many birthdays where she is a kid. Don\u2019t allow one to go to waste!\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve probably already broken that. Don\u2019t be surprised when she goes low or no contact. \n\nYou won\u2019t even make her favorite meal. YTA", "Your current behaviour is *way* more likely to result in your daughter believing that her dad loves her more than if you at least try to make an effort for her birthday.\n\nYou need to stop making this about you and start thinking about what is in your kid's best interests. She has already had to deal with your split from your ex, so the last thing she needs right now is to be your emotional punching bag.", "Oh god! You are not even trying, are you?", "If she thinks dad loves her more, it\u2019s because you had to be forced to acknowledge your own child\u2019s birthday.", "I mean, it sure sounds like her dad loves her more\u2026", "That sounds like your own insecurities talking. You\u2019re upset that dad has money to spend for parties and you don\u2019t. I\u2019m sure she would be happy if you made her a cake from a box, a nice dinner and had a movie night together. SOMETHING to make her feel loved. You\u2019re being selfish and spiteful to your ex. And she\u2019s going to remember that you did nothing to celebrate her birthday, made zero effort, and your ex will look like the loving dad cause he planned things. My parents are divorced and I wouldn\u2019t want my mom celebrating with my dads side of the family because they don\u2019t get along, which seems to be the same situation your daughter is in. She deserves acknowledgment of her birthday from you and it doesn\u2019t have to cost a ton of money.", "Also you\u2019re deciding to not spend any time or acknowledge your daughters birthday at all because you\u2019ve decided in your head that her birthday is actually about a competition with her father and you instead of about your child growing and living another year? \n\nI\u2019m a mortician. I had to deal with a lot of dead children in the last few years. I\u2019ve met a lot of parents going through the worst times of their lives, who will never experience another birthday with their child.

Because a teenager is being a teenager you also get to act like an immature teenager who can\u2019t handle her big emotions without lashing out at those who \u201cmade\u201d her feel those uncomfortable emotions?\n\nYour daughter is **14 freaking years old**. How are you actually so shocked and amazed at normal, nasty, teenage behavior to the point you\u2019ve decided to pout and throw a tantrum like a toddler? It is a well known fact that most, if not all teenagers, go through phases of nothing ever being good enough, hating their parents and saying horrible cruel shit when they don\u2019t get their way or are angry. Your job as a parent is very simple:: **To. Love. And. Support. Them. Anyways.** Thats literally all you have to do. If she says \u201cdad loves me more\u201d you say \u201ci love you the same as dad we just show it in different ways\u201d. What you do not get to do is go pout in a corner whining \u201cit won\u2019t be good enough so I\u2019m not doing anything because my daughter is a brat\u201d. **That is not how parenting works.** Efforts may be thrown in your face as not good enough now and that\u2019s just fine, that ***still*** better than you doing *nothing.* One day your child is going to grow up, grow out of being a snot and she\u2019s gonna look back and see how you handled her worst and ***that*** will be what defines your relationship with her. Be that mom who held nasty teenage behavior against your child for any length of time: a day, a week, or a decade and use that behavior that to determine how you treat her and I **promise** she will go no contact sooner rather than later.", "Well, she'd be right so far because you want to put in zero effort.", "Sounds like he does love her more when you're not even willing to acknowledge her birthday with ANYTHING.", "Wow, you really do hate your daughter. And just so you know, if you're daughter had any suspicions how little you love her, you've just validated them.", "I mean, she probably just wants mom to show her some love on her BDay, because honestly, it doesn't sound like you show her any.", "Someone sounds bitter that dad is rich, and is taking it out on their daughter. YTA", "Deadbeat mom.", "Do you really think so little of your daughter? You honestly believe that\u2019s how she would react?", "See, this is YOU equating money with love. Not her.", "I mean he does tho", "And you're just going to walk into that mold that his narrative has created and let your daughter believe that's reality. How about talking to her one on one calmly and lovingly and discuss not having a huge budget. \n\nTell her you'd love to do something with her and spend her birthday with her bonding and inviting maybe one or two of her friends. Maybe a little mani/pedi day and movie night/sleep over. It doesn't cost thousands to make your kids feel seen and loved", "It\u2019s better than literally nothing", "Let me give you another perspective:\n\nAs a teenager, I knew that I could afford gifts for my friends that were more expensive than my friends could (~$20 versus theirs being ~$5). \n\nDid that mean they didn\u2019t care about me as much as I cared for them? **No.** They still thought of me and bought me something with that $5 they could\u2019ve used for something for themselves.\n\nLast year, a friend got me an extra big Reese cup while I crocheted a stuffed bunny for them. Did that upset me, since we\u2019re in our 20s? Again, no. They don\u2019t have a job yet used their minimal spending money to get me a huge version of my favorite candy.\n\nThat\u2019s how your daughter will see it. That while you could do something as simple as get her a keychain or take her to a movie, you didn\u2019t because you don\u2019t care enough to.", "From every indication here her dad absolutely does love her more. You\u2019re pathetic. Be better.", "Are you well off?", "Her dad OBVIOUSLY loves her more. You won't even give her a card or cook her a meal she likes because you are too spiteful of your ex's relationship with your daughter. You suck", "Well, that is a sucky attitude! OP will have a problem in that case. D daughter won\u2019t see her as a caring parent. Just a b\u2014\u2014 of a mom.", "DO you even like your daughter? Because that's how it comes across...", "Not even a gift? You're a new level of asshole", "It\u2019s not about the amount; it\u2019s about her parent showing that she does think her kid is special and should be celebrated. That\u2019s what makes birthdays great. You\u2019re showing her you don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t have to be a party but why no mother-daughter date?", "With this logic, I bet you don\u2019t celebrate Christmas either. \n\nLemme explain this as simply as possible: what her father does for her celebrations does **NOT** affect what *you* do. It shouldn\u2019t even be on your damn radar because it\u2019s **NOT. FROM. YOU.** You are no longer with her father, he has made it abundantly clear he does not want you to ride his coattails and do joint presents and celebrations with you and something tells me he\u2019s got a valid reason why he won\u2019t. **His** celebrations are irrelevant to you and do not relieve you of your parental obligations and responsibilities. \n\nGet some freaking therapy lady.**Nobody** deserves to be treated like this, least of all by their own mother. This whole situation and every comment you\u2019ve made is absolutely disgusting beyond belief. If you can\u2019t get tf over yourself maybe you should remove yourself from the equation and give her father full custody. It truly doesn\u2019t sound like you actually want to be a mother anyways.", "You know, I was going to vote that you were in the clear on this one but your comments here changed my mind.", "Wow. You do not even like your daughter, do you? YTA", "Your comments are really one of a kind.", "So her dad does love her more. \nIt\u2019s her birthday!

You clearly have no idea because you don't even try.", "this shows a lack of interest or care towards your daughter, even if thats not what you intend. get her something small and make her favorite meal, both can be inexpensive and show you at least care a little", "Wow. You\u2019re lucky to have a relationship with her at all. Talk about bitter.", "You\u2019re honestly the worst! Wow!", "It's not about how many she gets, it's about which parent chooses not to make any effort.", "You can't even get her a card? No wonder he's doing so much. You're shit at being a decent parent.

You\u2019re probably gonna end up not having your daughter around anymore of this is how you treat her.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for children of divorced parents to end up with two parties.

Called her a brat and said she got enough and won\u2019t bother with anything.\n\nMy mother did the same shit one year (and I didn\u2019t get anything from any member of my family) and guess what?\n\nThe next time I see her, it\u2019ll be to hock a loogie into her open casket.

Who could have this much disdain for their own child? \n\nIn the off chance that you\u2019re not trolling, you don\u2019t have to actually get her a gift - you could take her out to dinner, or to a movie.

Even if father is going over the top with his celebrations, doesn't mean a mother shouldn't even TRY with a heartfelt card and a mom/daughter movie night in..... at least something! Daughter will remember her mom's bitterness and not receiving a single thing from them.", "Extremely close.

It's seriously eerie. \n\n(And I'm not calling all divorced parents shit, to be clear, there are lots that do it well. There's just a certain segment with their heads too far up their own asses to focus on what their *kids* need.)", "Seriously. I think I know why he doesn\u2019t want her there\u2026", "Is he a bad guy here? I mean, the OPs attitude is really crappy.

Maybe there is a reason he wants to celebrate separately.", "What a weird assumption that her \u201cex is not the best guy in the world\u201d. We don\u2019t know what party she asked to attend or exactly why he refused. For all we know she asked to crash the daddy/daughter celebration or she routinely gets hammered and makes a nasty scene at family functions, maybe their marriage ended because of something horrible she did and the party would be extremely uncomfortable for him and his family. Or maybe, and this is my bet, she can\u2019t manage to act like a f@cking adult, refuses to get along with any of the other attendees and will spend the whole entire party being a whiney insufferable brat pouting and complaining to anyone within earshot that dad \u201cspoils\u201d his daughter and how unnecessary and pointless all the parties are. \n\n***And*** I bet she wouldn\u2019t even bring a present if she was allowed to attend.", "It sounds to me that OP is a raging narcissist. She doesn\u2019t want to do anything that means she has to spend money. So that\u2019s more important than celebrating the day her daughter came into this world.", "Oh, OP had already covered this idea in another comment. She ASSUMED that her daughter wouldn't be pleased with home-made meal since dad threw thousands on parties. OP is sure that daughter is spoiled and wants another party...

It's not about money at this point, it's about punishing her daughter for her father. And honestly, three celebrations doesn't seem like that much. They're not 3 huge parties, they're an event with family, a friend birthday party, and then a daddy-daughter celebration. She could easily do a mommy-daughter celebration but she would rather hurt her daughter. \n\nShe just seems angry that her daughter has a loving and supportive father who isn't letting her tag along with one of his events.", "Yeah at the very least she\u2019s resentful towards the ex and is taking it out on the kid. In the worst case she just straight up hates her child", "Also I love the logic. \u201cIf I try and do something she\u2019ll accuse me of not loving her enough, so I\u2019m just not going to do anything.

If that was true I'm sure she would have given examples of that happening in the past. I feel so bad for this little girl.

No one has to go to a nursing home. They can stay in the house they live in now. Sure they might not be able to walk up the stairs or cook for themselves.
