It was working out well, she quit her job in October (since she wanted to finish that month to get her full salary paid). But the next month she woke up one time in the middle of the night because she didn't felt well, I drove her to the clinic and she was having a miscarriage, sadly there was nothing to be done and we lost our baby. \n\nAfter that we were both obviously very affected, but it was specifically hard for her. I took a few weeks off work to be there for her and suggested therapy but she said she'll get better on her own. She seems to be getting better now luckily. \n\nEver since a few weeks ago she's been complaining that I don't make enough money for her to buy stuff for herself. I have a good job, but I'm barely out of college so I have the lowest category at the firm I work in.

I already apologized because that's not what I meant to do, I'm just tired of hearing her complain about money. I spoke to my parents about this and they seem to be broken about this too as my mom agreed that I should not push my fiance too much but my dad told me he doesn't think it's okay for her to complain about money if she's not working.

You didn't tell her to get a job because you didn't care about her feelings, you said it because she kept complaining that you didn't give her enough spending money. Experiencing tragedy doesn't give someone the excuse to be cruel to the people that love them", "NTA, if she isn't happy with the quality of life you are providing then she needs to contribute. She has NO right to complain how fast the cart is moving if she isn't helping move it.", "NTA, it could have been better phrased but it's true. Marriage is a partnership and everyone needs to pull their weight to reach agreed upon goals.  However, I would urge her to get therapy again. It sounds like there are other unresolved issues for her.", "NTA. There is no time limit on grief, however, she quit her job to be a SAHM and unfortunately, she is not a mom. Unless you guys are actively trying to conceive again, it\u2019s time for her to go back to work if she\u2019s complaining about having no money. Kids and wedding are expensive and you guys should be saving every penny you can! \n\nI would say be gentle and encouraging, don\u2019t turn this into a fight. Tensions can run high around money, but I think if you approach her calmly and have a real conversation with her about how she\u2019s feeling, you guys can work it out.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA. If she's complaining she needs money to buy things, then she can get a job and make money so she can buy things instead of expecting you to magically make more money.", "NTA. I was a SAHM for 8+ years. It\u2019s hard work and it\u2019s hard to stretch one income no matter what because there are always things that need paid for for the baby or the house. Honestly I was a little surprised you both decided to have her stay at home while still early in pregnancy. There is no baby to take care of at this point and it\u2019s an excellent time to save up two incomes for the cost of birth and any complications as well as for those expenses that seemingly come out of nowhere. I do understand she is still struggling and she needs therapy no matter what she says however I also can\u2019t ignore the possibility that you two were never on the same page regarding work and finances to begin with. A SAH parent has to parent. She is grieving and that is understandable but it also doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t consider returning to work at some point. There is no reason for you to be financing her life of occasional chores and days out with friends.", "NTA:\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nThere're some red flags here. You made enough money for her to quit her job when she was pregnant, but not enough now?\n\nShe's making you feel bad about how much you make, but when you ask her to rejoin the work force she gaslights you.\n\nYes, she went through a lot. Yes, she has every right to grieve and in her own way ***until*** her grieving includes making you feel bad.\n\nYou might benefit from couples therapy. You both went through something huge and might need help on how to heal.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m confused why she isn\u2019t working? What m is she doing all day?", "NTA. This is one of those circumstances where I feel that an ultimatum is necessary\u2026 therapy and a job, or break off the engagement. \n>\n(I\u2019m sorry for your/her loss. Miscarriages are incredibly traumatic which is why therapy would be a non-negotiable for me)", "If she can\u2019t afford to buy stuff for herself, how were you going to afford to buy what the baby needed on just your salary? There\u2019s a bit of a disconnect there. \n\nThat said, I think fianc\u00e9e needs therapy after the miscarriage, and probably you do, too. NAH.", "NTA. The miscarriage was tragic,  but that doesn't explain her not getting a job yet.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want to go to actual therapy to cope with her grief, so instead she\u2019s doing retail therapy on your dime and complaining that you don\u2019t make enough to support that habit. That\u2019s not right. I don\u2019t want to be insensitive but the agreement was for your fianc\u00e9 to be a SAHM, not a stay at home partner. Unless you two are trying to get pregnant again, she should be planning to get a job soon.", "NTA.  She's also an adult, so she can contribute financially to your lives together and to the things she wants for herself.  \n\nI'm sorry about the miscarriage. But if she thinks it's affecting her too much 6 months later to work, then she needs to get some help.  It's still going to be hard even after the passage of some time, but life needs to go on and she needs to figure out how to be a functional adult again.", "NTA. She is hurting yes, but she obviously doesn't want to work and might be using it as a crutch/excuse to not work. Pregnant women with no pregnancy complications usually work up until the 3rd trimester- they don't quit when they are 2-3months in (usually people don't even tell others they are pregnant till the second trimester because about 15% of pregnancies don't make it past the first trimester).", "NTA\n\nShe is complaining and is just the two of you imagine you had a baby with all the stuff that you had to buy. I don't think your budget allows for a stay home parent.", "NTA she has no reason to not work.", "NTA and she should go to work. Miscarriages happen, it sucks . You lost  the baby too. People need to learn how to cope since life goes on. So either she gets a job or therapy but living off of you isn't acceptable. Plus she will try to get pregnant again so she doesn't have to work", "NTA. She should have already been looking for a job. She's a grown adult and yes went through something awful but that doesn't excuse basically being a mooch and complaining you don't make enough to suit her. You're right in your suggestion. I'd also say y'all don't make enough money for her to be a stay at home mom if you fall pregnant again.", "NTA.  Women all over the world have been known to actually be working when having miscarriages.  Women all over the world are able to go back to work after miscarriage, in fact it may be helpful to give her something else to focus her time and attention on.  She may need therapy if she doesnt feel ready to go back to work.   \n\nHowever, in my opinion, she should work and contribute financially to the home and to saving money now while you dont have kids so that when she gets pregnant again you guys will have a nice nest egg to see you through the times when she isn't working due to children.  I personally think it is a bad precedent to have a \"stay at home wife\"  who is complaining about funds when there is no need to stay home without kids to take care of.    I hope she isnt a moocher.  Time will tell.  I am a woman who raised 3 kids btw, so i am not anti woman, anti stay at home, i just think your gf has some other issues and maybe a different vision of the future than you.", "NTA women need to work too nowadays this ain\u2019t the 1950s where a household could survive on one income also if she wants to buy things for herself she needs to get a job to do that not expect you to pay bills and buy her everything miscarriages suck but bills don\u2019t take a break", "NTA.\n\nAlso, you are the fiance, your wife to be is the fiancee.", "NTA", "NTA. You should have said it more kindly, but she csnt spend money you don't  have. Retail therapy is a quick fix, but it doesnt solve problems, and she needs to consider therapy and think about starting to work again. the only reason I think she is slightly TZ I'd for refusing therapy and for her unhealthy cooking mechanism of shopping.\n\nMiscarriage is hard. It's not wrong to take time off and give yourself time to heal. Many people need time off. But it has been 4 months since the miscarriage. Each person us different, but many people are back at work by that point, especially if they cannot afford ti stay home. But also because humans need to keep themselves busy; in the longterm sitting at home and shopping are bad for you; ALL of us feel more depressed if we sit at home with nothing to do.  In the long run, her staying home to think about your loss may be hampering her recovery. She needs to start doing activities again, socialising bit by bit and maybe starting a bit of work part time. And if she isn't well enough to, then she needs to see a doctor.\n\nI would argue that she ISN'T coping, if she is relying on staying home and spending money she doesn't have, in order to feel better, 4 months later. She has tried without therapy, and she still hasnt fully processed what happened. \n\nNow, babies are expensive. Equipment is expensive, they are constantly growing out of clothes, and nappies and milk are not cheap. Much more than you realise. If her shopping has strained your finances, then having a baby will also do the same.  Next time around, I would recommend not leaving her job until closer to the due date; most people do not give up work until the baby is almost there, unless they are having difficulties in the pregnancy. Every cent saved will really matter.", "Sounds like she quit her job too soon?", "NAH. You\u2019re both obviously in a difficult spot and communication isn\u2019t going well, but based on your retelling, it sound a little like she\u2019s projecting. I think therapy is a great idea but maybe approaching the discussion about her getting a job more delicately next time will be more successful.", "ESH. Your reaction could have been better but there\u2019s two options here, she stops shopping or she gets a job. I\u2019m not sure where you live but 26k USD is barely a living wage where I live\u2026 especially for two people on one income (Canada). Supporting a wife and kids on that income will be even harder.", "**NAH**\n\nThis is a heart breaking time for both of you. The best course of action here is open and honest communication. \n\nIn a moment where you are geting along well you calmly broach the fact with her that you're trying your best, working really hard, and you would love to make more money. But right now, in your field and career, you are still building and if she wants more money that would be great but she will have to contribute income. Make it clear that in no way do you blame her for what happened to the baby, that you love and respect her, that you are willing to support her process but that telling you that you don't make enough is hurtful. Tell her that you're hurting too, that you wanted, more than anyhthing, to be bringing up a baby with her and that her miscarriage has affected both of you. Tell her you're not pushing her to work but that right now, if she wants more money, her working is the main, realistic option. \n\nSee what happens OP and good luck.", "So, how was this supposed to play out? You don't earn enough for two, but you where planning on being the breadwinner with her being a SAHM? You obviously did not have a proper budgetting conversation before you got pregnant. \n\nESH.", "NAH\n\nI think you both could have handled this better.   \nIf she would like more money to spend on frivolous ways - she can earn her own money to throw at things", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would say that it's a miss on both you and her for not seeking therapy, and it's never too late. Please seek out some therapy. You should both need it, whether separately or together, for the loss of your child. If she won't go for her, ask her to go with you for you. Hopefully, she engages, and see if the therapist feels it's appropriate for her to have individual sessions. \n\nThe reason for saying YTA, though, is the expectation that she return to work or stop complaining about money. I KNOW that is frustrating. In fact, money is the number one cause or martial arguments. But what you're seeing is a symptom of something else.

It's also something you two need to seriously discuss before getting married as financial problems / arguments are the biggest cause of divorce.", "If your wife were in therapy and still struggling, I'd call you the A. But she's had therapy offered and refuses to go, and her current issues are a direct consequence of that choice. That places you very firmly in the NTA category.", "NTA", "NTA. You can't afford to have a child yet.", "NTA!! you were blunt and truthful and sometimes that hurts. If she feels she doesn't have enough money to spend, she needs to work and earn for herself as well and it might help with her mindset after a miscarriage to give her something more to do again.", "NTA.  I've had a couple of miscarriages, so I understand that, emotionally, it's really hard to get over them.  That being said, retail therapy won't help.  If she's not working, that gives her tons of time to dwell on what happened.\n\nStand your ground.  You can afford to provide the basics but not anything else beyond.  As you pointed out, $26k a year isn't going to stretch very far for two people.  It will be a serious problem if she gets pregnant again because she hasn't been banking any cash and you haven't been able to save much/any money while supporting both of you.  She needs to go back to work and help build savings now to hedge against future pregnancies when she wants to stop working.", "NTA. She can get a pt job. It will take her mind off if her trauma. I honestly think shes milking it. Just my personal opinion and I've had 3 miscarriages", "I\u2019m sorry to say this, but she isn\u2019t healing on her own. She\u2019s either:\n\n1. Putting you both into financial debt due to her developing \u201cretail therapy\u201d addiction.\n\nor\u2026\n\n2. She\u2019s using her grief as an excuse to splurge while avoiding any responsibility (working and contributing to finances). \n\nIf she isn\u2019t willing to go to therapy and/or make changes, you might want to reconsider this relationship.", "Except this situation forces into the light that she very much is not healing.", "\"I don't need therapy, I need more spending money\" yeah, NTA", "I have a question that I hope isn\u2019t too personal\u2026.\n\nHow far along was she when she quit her job? I only ask because typically when women that work decide to be a stay at home mom, they usually work through the pregnancy and don\u2019t go on leave or quit until right before their due date. It sounds like she quit pretty much immediately after finding out she was pregnant, which is a red flag that suggests she was planning to throw all the financial responsibility out the window all along.", "You guys have bigger issues than just this.  Sounds like she's refusing to move on. Nta", "She definitely needs therapy. Buying stuff is not gonna fix anything.", "NTA. I agree, I get same vibes. Got pregnant then immediately quits job. Unfortunately loose the baby, ok grieving is understandable. But she refuses to go to therapy and spends OPs money buying stuff for herself complaining he should be doing more while she does almost nothing... It sounds like she either planned to not working by getting pregnant (I know people like this) from the start or she got used to not needing to work and she plays the miscarriage card to the fullest.", "NTA but you have seen your future. She quit her job before she even had the baby, she's not interested in building a financial future with you. She's looking to take, take, take and tear you down for not providing in a way she wants to be accustomed.", "NTA, you made the request conditional--*if* she wants more money, she should get a job. It's not all on you if you're doing your best.", "She' a grown up. Grown ups have jobs or sell themselves online to make that money. Shes a mother. Tell her to man tf up.", "NTA. If she has the audacity to complain that you do not make enough money, then she is healed enough and ready to start a new job. Period.", "You may want to rethink this man.\n\nNovember she had the miscarriage? So three months ago? You've been financially supporting her for all this time and she complains that YOU aren't earning enough?\n\nShe refuses to get help with her grief?\n\nAt some point, its not your responsibility to help someone who wont help themselves. \n\nEither: \n\na) She needs to get over her grief and doing it herself clearly isn't working, or\n\nb) She's over her grief and just likes the lifestyle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeither of which stop her from getting a job.", "NTA\n\nUsually when you decide to become a SAHM you do it when the baby is born, not the second you find out you\u2019re pregnant.", "NTA and if she really is still depressed I\u2019m sure laying around the house all day doesn\u2019t help with her depression. Having a reason to force yourself out of bed (like a job) even just for spending money can really help in my opinion. I didn\u2019t need to work either we could live off just my husbands salary but I got really depressed being cooped up in the house all day. Getting out and working and having some human interaction made a big difference.", "NTA. I understand that she\u2019s grieving, but retail therapy isn\u2019t the solution. She needs to address her grief with a professional so she can get back to her normal life.", "I disagree with you on the term \"she is not a mom\". Even if her child died an she can't take care for her child, she is still a mom.\nIt's important for many people who miscarried, that the child is still part of the family, even if it's not physically there. \nOf course you can never say that for everyone, grief has many faces, but as someone who had several misscarrieges (and also a very alive 3yo) I just didn't want to leave that sentence uncommented. \n\nBut I agree with you on the NTA vote and that they should talk about their feelings. I don't think it's healthy that she complains and doesn't get a job. It would give her structure and fill her life with something else to do then buying things. I think she tries to fill the emptyness with stuff she buys, which definetly doesn't help in the long run.\nIf she doesn't want to try therapy, maybe it helps to talk to other moms with similar experiences. She is not alone. \n\nSorry, English isn't my first language.", "They found out she was pregnant in Sept and she quit her job in Oct, one month later. I think she really liked the idea of not working, and I think she still really likes that idea.", "NTA op, but you may want to reconsider this marriage", "NTA bit early to quit a job", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry you lost your baby\n\nHer behavior is an indicator of how the future is gonna be with her. Do you think it'll get better if you have another baby someday? What if you had urgent expenses and you couldn't afford it? What would she do then cause I suspect she knows very well how much you earn.\n\n Her first reaction was entitlement. Yes it's hard for her I know but nagging for money is not the answer. I think you should reconsider the whole SATM thing. \n\nAlso, I don't  believe she wants to get back to work\n\nJust some thoughts regarding the STAP. I have nothing against people who want to stay at home and raise their kids in the sense that I know this requires a lot of work. But not one of them is concerned about what the future will bring? A spouse might lose their job, divorce, or die. What happens if you have no job for the past 7 years for example? Do you think it's easy to get back on track or start from 0 with low earnings cause of the lack of experience?", "NTA.  It might actually be good for her mental health to have a job & interact with people instead of sitting home all day alone.", "NTA you can't complain about money and not work when you are able to.", "NTA. She does need therapy. Retail therapy won\u2019t work and will cause new issues. She needs to work and get therapy. But of course I feel for her and you", "NTA", "Time for her to get her ass a job. Ungrateful B", "NTA. I had numerous miscarriages. It really sucks and is difficult to \u201cget over,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean she has a free pass to complain and not contribute to your future together.", "She needs to get a job. Do not marry this person for a very long time. She is tooooo immature.  Bad stuff happens to all of us. It will happen all your life. If you can't get over it, you are not ready to be life partner.\n\nIt takes two adults to make a relationship work.", "As someone who miscarried and has a 17 year old, I have completely opposite thoughts to be honest.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to phrase that she is a mom and to compare a very young fetus that was never a living, breathing, autonomous being as a child.  It\u2019s unfortunate that the feelings around miscarrage are so stigmatized that we compare pregnancy loss to child loss, or compare pregnancy to motherhood, in order for the loss and pain to be acknowledged and seen.  \n\nWhat we mourn in pregnancy loss is the ungratified and unseen hypotheticals, and it\u2019s okay to mourn those possibilities.", "You are completely right, I worded that sentence badly. I just meant that she\u2019s not really a \u201cstay at home mom\u201d without a child, she\u2019s currently just a \u201cstay at home wife\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s a good point about talking to other moms who have experienced the same thing. A support group, if she can find one, would probably be very helpful", "Your English is amazing. I\u2019m ESL too.", "Maybe you are right and we should not decide if she feels as a mom or not.\nBut I think if you see a difference in pregnancy loss or child loss, it's maybe a question of your own believe when life starts. Some see it with conception and some with birth. At what point is the fetus a child? When you lose your baby at 40 weeks and you have to stillbirth, is it pregnancy loss or child loss? But I agree it was harder to lose an older fetus than a younger one and I don't even want to think about how it must feel to lose a child you held in your arms. \n\nAlso we get a special \"mother's passport\" as an medical ID as soon as a doctor confirms the pregnancy. There are medical notes throughout the pregnancy and birth and it is continued for every new pregnancy, wether it ends with the birth of a healthy child or not. We are supposed to have it with us through the whole pregnancy, so in case of an emergency or accident the medical team knows immediately what to do. Maybe that also has impact in me seeing a pregnant woman as a mother and I'm aware it isn't handled like that everywhere in the world. \n\nI think it is just very personal how to see this and there is no right or wrong.\nWe also don't know how far along she was when she miscarried. And also it was her first pregnancy/child. I know many people who could find stability in having already a child around they could be thankful and care for. I can also see, that it can be hard to function as a parent while grieving. Again, no right or wrong. Just wanted to add a perspective.\n\nAnd I still think that the child/fetus/experience belongs to the family. It is part of family history and has an influence on everybody envolved. Of course some more than others.", "NTA\nThere was absolutely no reason for her to quit her job a month after finding out she was pregnant. I'm currently 18 weeks pregnant and don't even plan to take time off except for to go to appointments. I will take the offered paid time off through work after the baby is born and possibly extra time if my work and FMLA will allow it \n\nI also had a miscarriage 2 years ago, working helped to keep me busy and distracted me from the pain. I can not imagine expecting my partner to fully support me and find a way to earn extra money just so I could spend more without being willing to work. If she had her miscarriage in November or early December, it's been about 3 months, by this point she should be able to work at least part time.", "NTA, she needs to go back to work. I understand that she had a rough go for a while but she doesn't get to permanently decide that she's not going to work and give you crap about being less than well off at the same time!", "If she wants to spend more money... then she needs to work and earn the money herself.  You working more doesn't seem at all fair, which is what she seems to think you should do. NTA.", "NTA. She either needs to stop her spending or get a job. If she can\u2019t handle a job due to her miscarriage then she needs to get therapy. I had a miscarriage and it\u2019s horrible. I would rather go through labor a hundred times than to have had a miscarriage. It\u2019s more painful physically it seems because your body is pushing out a dead child instead of the baby using the contractions to get out. Apparently the baby uses it\u2019s own muscles to get out as well that a miscarriage doesn\u2019t have.  So understandably it\u2019s traumatic all the way around. So if she can\u2019t go back to work because if the miscarriage, then she needs therapy!", "NTA.  She\u2019s gotten too comfortable with being jobless.  By the way.  This ends poorly.  Just so you know.", " Unless you two are trying to get pregnant again, she should be planning to get a job soon.", "She doesn't want to go to therapy because she doesn't want to face those feelings she hasn't dealt with.  She's \"dealing\" with them by shopping, which is not a healthy way to handle it.  It's important to feel those big feelings even when they're painful.  The only way out is through. \n\nYou have got to find a way to get her into therapy.  Maybe she would be willing to go to support you if you told her that YOU needed to see someone but really needed her by your side?", "I worked from home after my miscarriage but having something to focus on definitely helped distract me from the pain a little", "NTA", "I'm so sorry for your loss.   She needs therapy.  Respectfully,  maybe you need to think about if she's really the right person.   There's no excuse to be a stay at home wife. That wasn't your agreement.  NTA", "Nta She needs a job.", "Gosh, she cannot complain about money if she doesn't contribute. I get it, miscarriage is hard but actually, having a job is also a way to keep you mind busy instead of doing not much home (and I doubt she cleans for 8h a day) NTA"]}
