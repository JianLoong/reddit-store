I would stick to the 6month rule.", "NTA! The \u201c6mo rule\u201d is in place for a reason, & its meant to keep weirdos outta ur kids lives! God forbid u wanted to break it\ud83e\udee3 it would be hell on surface", "I can see both sides but ultimately this is a rule you both agreed and made up together. And 2 months is awfully short.\nShe might feel serious, he might feel the same but the truth is she certainly doesn\u2019t know him on a deeper level yet, his real character, his finances, his friends and family relationships. Or if they are compatible in the longer term.\nNTA. As a compromise, you could offer to give her more alone time by keeping your kid for date nights ?", "NTA, 2 months together is basically no strings attached dating. It\u2019s not a long lasting relationship. There\u2019s a chance she could be kicked to the curb by her new boyfriend tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s in the kids best interest to stick to the rule. It makes sense, to protect your son.", "NTA.\n\nTwo months is not a long enough time at all. My parents used to get really intense about partners, have them around us and they would often start trying to parent us like idiots or they would be really nice to us and we would get really upset when they would break up a month or so later.\n\nSix months is a very sensible rule. My husband and I are still together but have said the same thing when discussing 'what if' scenarios. Both of us were affected by our divorced parents being serial daters when we were young.", "NTA, you both agreed to the 6 months rule when you were single and i feel like she may not be thinking \"straight\" because feelings are involved \n\nYou chose 6 months for a reason, you should stick to it", "You are NTA but there is probably not a lot you can do about it.  It is a good rule IMHO.  Might even say a year is better than 6 months. Kids don't need to see a constant parade of pseudo mommys and daddys parading through their houses and lives.  Kids get attached fast and will suffer if their parents' new relationships go sour.\n\nSlower the better.", "The point of the rule is that you don't introduce sixteen \"stepparents\" in three years, right? Well, \"this is Mummy's new friend, he has kids, wanna play with them?\" is very much not that. I think framing it that way to your ex - this is a meeting, not an Introduction Of New Parental Figure - would probably be helpful to all three of you.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but I do think you'd be wise to yield this one. Establishing a baseline of being flexible when it makes sense to be will help everyone in the long run. NAH.", "Definitely NTA. I have the same rule with my kids father and he's had 3 or 4 girlfriend and I don't know how many FWB in the 2 years we've been separated. He has continuously violated our rule and caused confusion and trauma with our children because of this.", "NTA. What if the kids become best friends and the parents break up? What if the kids absolutely hate each other and the parents get married? Not really a smart move to introduce them when there's loads of potential for negative consequences, especially way too early on. The rule was made to protect your son, and it should continue to do so. She's trying to manipulate it for her own sake, not for your kid's.", "I would\u2019ve said a year, but yeah, the rule needs to stand... Because I\u2019m most positive that if the roles were reversed, she would not be having it...", "NTA. How's there even time to date with kiddos to raise?", "NTA. Those rules exist for a reason. If the other children\u2019s mother is okay with them meeting your ex after 2 months, that\u2019s her decision to make. But you are still the father and you should have a right to say who meets your son. \n\nAlso, do you think she\u2019d give you grace if the roles were reversed?", "No Conflict here.  Your both adults, and as adults you both came up with these rules together, for the benefit of your child you have together.  Just because the rules that you both come up with at the moment don't benefit her, she still has to abide by the rules, because the rules are to protect your child.  It was the intent of the rules to protect your child, not to make it easier to date.  The rules you made are essentially a contract, don't break the rules, don't change the rules, don't amend them.\n\nYour child might make friends with this mans kids, they may not.", "NAH\n\nShe's not an AH for asking, and you aren't one for saying no. However, the obvious solution would be to arrange playdates for the children, of course without date like contributions from ex and date.", "INFO - does your ex get as much childfree time as you? It might be really hard for her to go on dates if she can only date without the child. I\u2019d also give her big kudos for actually communicating with you too", "Maybe I am wrong but I think soft YTA.\n\nI think that the length of time to be dating for you to introduce to kids is subjective. Sure 6 months makes sense when you sit down and agree to it, but 6 months of dating when you have kids and they aren't allowed to see them is really challenging.\n\nMost couples will just introduce their kids and ex to their partner when they feel it appropriate. Not after a set amount of time. Maybe say \"I'll be happy to change it just as long as I get to meet them first. I want to know the person you are introducing to our kids is good for them.\"\n\nI feel like denying her will create unnecessary drama. They will not be happy with you sticking to them waiting another 4 months to see the kids.", "YWBTA. Rules serve you, not the other way around. If the rule doesn't make much sense (like this being the first time, not a long pattern of behavior) then you should modify the rule. Coparenting is all about compromise, and this isn't an actual problem so far.", "YTA. It is 2 months not 2 weeks", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's single af and dates a lot and most of the time they stop seeing each other within a month. I didnt want my kids getting attached to a new adult and then having their hearts broken multiple times a year. My kids got to meet one girlfriend, we all went out to dinner and had a nice time! Aaaaaaand they broke up a week later. His dad finally understood and he hasnt wanted to bring any other people around the kids. \n\nThe rule was never a punishment.

It\u2019s not like the rule is you have to be together 5 years or something ridiculous. I fail to understand why he needs to bend in this scenario when if she\u2019s really serious about this guy, 4 months is nothing. Why rush it?", "A couple I know recently broke up and they are already living with their new partners (one of them being the reason for the divorce) and children. They have switched schools so some of the kids are in the same class. It's only been months and everyone is really unstable right now.

She can absolutely go on dates while he has custody, or when the kid is asleep if she has a babysitter.", "No it isn\u2019t. 2 weeks is 2 weeks, 2 months is 8 weeks", "In strict time frame your correct but in terms of getting to know somebody and building a relationship 2 months is absolutely nothing and you barely know that person\n\nWay too early to introduce children", "Well I disagree", "That\u2019s fine everybody is entitled to their opinion", "Exactly", "NTA, but six months is way to short, unless the kid is, like 16 or 17.  A year, minimum.", "NTA 6 months makes sense and you guys should meet each others partners beforehand to make sure they understand boundaries.", "NTA she needs to find a better schedule rather than immediately jumping to having the guy meet the child. Just because he has children doesn't mean anything. However be mindful that she can do as she pleases and may break the rule.", "NTA because you both agreed to the rule and she wants to change the instant it comes into play for her. 6 months is not that long, and it is a good rule to make that the relationship is stable before upending the family dynamics with your child again. The last thing they need is to meet a new person, be told they'll be around a lot, and then suddenly they aren't anymore.", "NTA", "NTA. You made this agreement while the 'light of love' was not blinding either of you to what is best for your child.", "NTA. The rule is in place for a reason. To protect your child.\n\nShe wants to change the rule now, for her own convenience, not because it\u2019s in the best interests of the child. Only 2 months in and she\u2019s already prioritising her relationship over the well-being of her child. That\u2019s a co-parenting/single parent red flag. You stick to your guns.", "I mean, it\u2019s a fair rule but she doesn\u2019t have to stick to your previous agreement. It\u2019s not enforceable. While I agree with you, NAH", "NAH but 6 months is a LONG time- and will prevent your child from seeing his mom unnecessarily. I can see how it feels short in theory, but in practice it would potentially ruin what could be a good relationship. I would let up on a few months or - if you feel mature, meet the guy yourself and you can have an adult discussion if how to handle the inevitable interaction with your kid - instead of arbitrary time rules", "NTA I would have made it a year so 6 months is already very lenient. The fact that she is even asking shows that she is putting herself above the child. You are in for some battles if this continues. Start documenting. It never hurts to be prepared.", "NTA\n\nThis is important.  Your child can and will develop attachments to the new partners and / or the children.\n\nYou do not want your child to deal with the pain of abandonment  if it doesn't work out between ex and partner. \n\nYou set up this rule when neither were dating for a reason.  There should be no wiggle room on this.", "NTA. Stick to the 6 month rule. If they break up your son will suffer.  She will inflict more trauma.", "NTA. Keep the 6 month rule. It's there for a reason. I've seen too many AITA posts on here, usually from the child's perspective, where one parent has hopped from partner to partner, and it has ALWAYS ended badly.", "NAH, and your ex is under ZERO obligation to adhere.  It isn't a very practical rule and is simply unnecessary.", "I was the other guy with two kids of my own in this situation. It was almost impossible to actually have time for us to hang out in person without having our kids there as well. Her and her ex had a conversation and decided sooner than 6 months would be ok, if the exes got to meet with the new person. So, she went to dinner with her exes new gf, and I went to happy hour with her ex. We got on just fine, had a good laugh about the situation, and have been enjoying life instead of trying to work around a massive barrier. Her kids are great, my kids are great, life is good. We recently crossed 6 months and it seems silly to think we should have waited that long. But, every situation is different.", "Nta.\n\nMy ex and I had a similar rule although there was no time limit.  We both believed our son was too young to be dating which is what happens when you introduce your kids to people before you are sure they are long term.\n\nWe have been apart for over 5 years. My son has meet one woman, whom he is engaged to and one man who I have been seeing seriously for 2 years (he meet him about 3 months ago)", "NTA.  I'm not even going to bother with an explanation, because you know YNTA.", "NTA.  A rule is a rule for a reason and shouldn't be changed just because the wind blows a different direction.  That said, I'm betting she ends up breaking it regardless.", "Stick to the 6 month rule. Hold your ground bro", "NAH, i understand both parties, but as far as i read it, she asked you first, which is respectful. I dont see an ass here, since asking costs nothing. I would also stick to the rule though", "It\u2019s not even just weirdos! Your kids just went through all the uncertainty and upheaval of a divorce, fears of losing their parents, etc. The last thing they need emotionally is to go through meeting a new person, building an attachment, and then losing all that again if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s about giving your kids a sense of stability in an already tough time. \n\nDating is great and I get that dating with kids is hard. But your kids needs and wellbeing gotta come first. If she\u2019s sure this new guy is it permanently then he\u2019ll still be it permanently in four months. These kids have already been through a lot, least you can do is take it slow. \n\nLove, someone who used to be a kid of divorce and remembers what it was like.", "It's also so kids have more stability and don't get attached to a guy that could leave early in the relationship", "Yeah, but the rule is NOT enforceable.  Either party can break it at any time.  Someone could definitely be a weirdo just as easily at 181 days as they could at  60 days.", "4 months crossed my mind too", "Oh I agree. But there a good chunk of submissions on here have to do with parents dropping their kids like a bad habit once they find a new romantic partner."]}
