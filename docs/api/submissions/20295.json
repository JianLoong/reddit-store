And 2 months is awfully short.\nShe might feel serious, he might feel the same but the truth is she certainly doesn\u2019t know him on a deeper level yet, his real character, his finances, his friends and family relationships. Or if they are compatible in the longer term.\nNTA. As a compromise, you could offer to give her more alone time by keeping your kid for date nights ?", "NTA, 2 months together is basically no strings attached dating. It\u2019s not a long lasting relationship. There\u2019s a chance she could be kicked to the curb by her new boyfriend tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s in the kids best interest to stick to the rule. It makes sense, to protect your son.", "NTA.\n\nTwo months is not a long enough time at all. My parents used to get really intense about partners, have them around us and they would often start trying to parent us like idiots or they would be really nice to us and we would get really upset when they would break up a month or so later.\n\nSix months is a very sensible rule. My husband and I are still together but have said the same thing when discussing 'what if' scenarios. Both of us were affected by our divorced parents being serial daters when we were young.", "NTA, you both agreed to the 6 months rule when you were single and i feel like she may not be thinking \"straight\" because feelings are involved \n\nYou chose 6 months for a reason, you should stick to it", "You are NTA but there is probably not a lot you can do about it.  It is a good rule IMHO.  Might even say a year is better than 6 months. Kids don't need to see a constant parade of pseudo mommys and daddys parading through their houses and lives.  Kids get attached fast and will suffer if their parents' new relationships go sour.\n\nSlower the better.", "The point of the rule is that you don't introduce sixteen \"stepparents\" in three years, right? Well, \"this is Mummy's new friend, he has kids, wanna play with them?\" is very much not that. I think framing it that way to your ex - this is a meeting, not an Introduction Of New Parental Figure - would probably be helpful to all three of you.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but I do think you'd be wise to yield this one. Establishing a baseline of being flexible when it makes sense to be will help everyone in the long run. NAH.", "Definitely NTA.

It was the intent of the rules to protect your child, not to make it easier to date.

I\u2019d also give her big kudos for actually communicating with you too", "Maybe I am wrong but I think soft YTA.\n\nI think that the length of time to be dating for you to introduce to kids is subjective. Sure 6 months makes sense when you sit down and agree to it, but 6 months of dating when you have kids and they aren't allowed to see them is really challenging.\n\nMost couples will just introduce their kids and ex to their partner when they feel it appropriate. Not after a set amount of time. Maybe say \"I'll be happy to change it just as long as I get to meet them first. I want to know the person you are introducing to our kids is good for them.\"\n\nI feel like denying her will create unnecessary drama. They will not be happy with you sticking to them waiting another 4 months to see the kids.", "YWBTA. Rules serve you, not the other way around.

The fact that she is even asking shows that she is putting herself above the child. You are in for some battles if this continues. Start documenting. It never hurts to be prepared.", "NTA\n\nThis is important.

It was almost impossible to actually have time for us to hang out in person without having our kids there as well. Her and her ex had a conversation and decided sooner than 6 months would be ok, if the exes got to meet with the new person. So, she went to dinner with her exes new gf, and I went to happy hour with her ex. We got on just fine, had a good laugh about the situation, and have been enjoying life instead of trying to work around a massive barrier. Her kids are great, my kids are great, life is good. We recently crossed 6 months and it seems silly to think we should have waited that long. But, every situation is different.", "Nta.\n\nMy ex and I had a similar rule although there was no time limit.

I would also stick to the rule though", "It\u2019s not even just weirdos! Your kids just went through all the uncertainty and upheaval of a divorce, fears of losing their parents, etc. The last thing they need emotionally is to go through meeting a new person, building an attachment, and then losing all that again if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out.

But *eight weeks* into dating someone? That's not even the halfway point! That's not \"adapting\" the rule, it's throwing it out the window completely. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Stick to your rule, I bet you she would probably not be okay with you doing it.", "NTA. 6 months is reasonable. Kids don't need adults coming in and out of their lives. It's harder on the parent who has majority custody but even so, I waited years to introduce my partner to my children.", "NTA- all I can think about is a Reddit post from a young woman who dated a seemingly normal guy and introduced her kiddo to him, only to find out a few months in he was quietly encouraging kiddo to call him dad and telling kiddo her biodad didn\u2019t love her.\n\nDude went total crazy stalker.\n\nThere is a reason you have a time buffer in the beginning before you bring your kids in.", "NTA. 2 months is nothing.", "Two months as in 60 days? NTA, stand your ground.", "NTA, I know people who grew up being introduced to multiple new partners of their parents. You don't do them any favours by rushing into it. When breakups do happen, they can be confused or angry if they liked the person, and can come to have a negative view on relationships if they are weird or bad. You wanna make sure you're at least committed before introductions are made.", "NTA\n\nHold firm Op", "My thing is always: what's the hurry? \n\nIt's agood rule, good on you for trying to enforce it. I hope she respects the boundary.", "NTA.  I had the same rule with my ex & the rule is in place for a reason.  You don't want your kids meeting & getting used to someone that isn't going to be sticking around.  Stick with your 6 month rule it will be better for the kids.  She's making it about her.  Selfish.", "NTA. That rule is for your child's best interest. It keeps creeps and assholes away from your kid, it protects him from having a revolving door of strangers entering and exiting his life, and it saves everyone a lot of time and energy meeting and assessing a new person who may just disappear from his life one day potentially traumatizing him if he ever got attached to one if them.\n\nYour ex needs to be more concerned about her child than her budding relationship, she can see her BF whenever she doesn't have your son until the 6 months is up. Hold strong!", "NTA.  Seems likes she\u2019s rushing into a \u201cnew family\u201d.  If you felt like bending the rule i would insist on meeting the man and maybe even his children before.", "NTA and don't give in. This would likely lead to disaster with a series of men coming through your kid's life.", "NTA I'm sure if it was the other way round she would not be ok with you wanting to change the rule.\n\nThe rule is there for the sake of the kids.\n\nIt's irresponsible to introduce kids to people (and THEIR kids!) if you haven't known them long enough to know if it's serious. No point if it's not serious!\n\nI say this as someone who has two stepparents and also have a stepkid of my own.\n\nEDIT : it's not just about potential weirdos, when I was 10 my mum moved in my now stepdad after meeting him in person only a handful of times. they had a very rocky releationship at the time and multiple times I was met by her sobbing and saying he was leaving and I was sooooo upset by this every time, because I really liked him and my little stepbrother.\n\nthankfully he didn't leave, but I can't imagine if he'd have left and then some other guy came and went... which is the situation for a lot of people. it would have been so upsetting to have gotten attached to someone and they're gone.", "NTA\n\nAsk her to wait and explain its not okay.", "She was able to agree with 6 months when she could look at it rationally. Now she has a vested interest in the opposite and would likely try to rationalize it even when she herself knows it is a bad idea.\n\nStick with the decision you made when you both could look at it for what is best for the kid.", "You're NTA. You made this rule for a reason. Kids news consistency and two months isn't enough time imo. Kids get attached easily, you don't want that to happen if she has only been involved with this person for two months and risk your son getting hurt. I think 6months is a good time.", "Depends on the age of your kids, if they are teens, well they are old enough to know that the relationship may not last. I say if they are under 15, you ex needs to wait 4 months.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You can ask her to stick to the agreed upon 6 month rule but unfortunately, if she wants to introduce someone to the kids, there is nothing you can do about it (as someone who had a 1 year agreement and my ex introduced someone within 6 months and I voiced my opinion, but it didn't ultimately matter)", "NTA\n\nPlease please please stick to this rule, I watched a family member introduce her daughters to many different new \"bfs\" when they were young within weeks sometimes and I seen how it really confused and messed with the children when they would disappear and all that.    \nI even as a family member didn't introduce my now spouse until 3-4 months and only that early b/c we bought a house together at that point.", "NTA- Two months, too soon.", "Nope! NTA. \n\nThe 6 months rule is a good one. It protects your child and prevents them from experiencing the revolving doors effect. 2 months is not a very long time. Your ex and her new \u201cboyfriend\u201d might break up next week. Why subject the kids to that??", "NTA. Two months isn\u2019t long enough to know someone let alone expose a kid to them.", "NTA", "Not the asshole, having dealt with this exact situation myself. Ex wife met a guy and dated for a month and moved and an hour and a half away. If they would have moved further I would\u2019ve had ti take her to court for breach of our custody agreement. But as it now stands I have to travel a 3 hour round trip to take and pick up my kids from school. They have to get up at 5:30am get ready to go. Almost lost my job because of it but my boss told the higher ups I get everything done which I do. Life is hell right now. The kids hate the guy.", "Six months is barely anything let alone two. She needs to hold her horses on this one. Especially as she's wanting the children to meet - that's really not great.", "NAH. And  please try to have a rational, calm conversation about why it\u2019s important. Six months is not a long time for an adult but it is for a kid. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that they would want to speed the process but it isn\u2019t something that\u2019s been put into place vindictively.\n\nMake sure to keep it focused on the agreement and the reasons for it and not personal or about the new guy. In six months, they can plan a great play date and see how it goes.\n\nShe\u2019s not an asshole for asking, you\u2019re not an asshole for declining. Keep it about the kids.", "NAH \n\nShe asked, you\u2019d like to stick to the original agreement, all good :)", "NTA but\u2026.. I think 4 months is a good indication of whether the new relationship will last and then I think introducing kids is fair.\n\nUltimately however, it\u2019s her life and she can do as she pleases, you have to trust her judgement.", "Perhaps this is not a AH situation but a time to grow, learn and be flexible. \n\nI'm both step and bio so heard me out. If the kids are the same ages range and they want to go to a play zone or movie it could just be a friend date to see how they get on. He might not like your kids, they might not like him or vise versa. Same with you ex and his kids. Even the kids just might not get along! \n\nThere's so much that goes into bonding a family and I think just letting them meet the other kids and no lovey-dovey stuff between the adults etc infront of the kids for a few months.\n\nWhy no ask if you can met him, he might be a nice bloke and if he's going to be spending time around your kids you need to sus him out. \n\nYour going to be in a relationship with you ex and whoever she meets for the rest of your life.

Reading the limit information supplied, that\u2019s not the case here I think. \n\nAn important part of knowing a relationship is going to work out is seeing how that person treats your child. This could be a solid argument, but the \u2018having more time together\u2019 doesn\u2019t really hold up for me. \n\nHowever, note that she is trying to level with you and respects you enough to talk about this with you.\nBut you could always discuss this with her and see if you guys can figure out a way to deal with this that makes you both happy.\n\nNAH.", "I think it is different in that she doesn\u2019t have to into him as a BF.

Yes, it would be great if your kid gets along well with her partner\u2019s kids but if things didn\u2019t last between them it would just be more instability for your child. 6 months isn\u2019t even a very long time to be seeing someone when you are a busy adult with the responsibility of child care anyways. Literally they will have been seeing each other for 6 months in what feels like the blink of an eye and if at that point things are going well, then she can freely introduce them.", "NTA.   And you should be aware that the likelihood of sex abuse increases geometrically when unrelated male in household", "Absolutely no, NTA. Children do not need to be exposed to the instability of their parents' dating lives after divorce. It's been all of two months, they could be broken up tomorrow. What if your kid becomes friendly with these other children and then bam, never sees them again.", "NAH, but your rule is plain stupid. Don't you both (when you were together, and now separately) have adult friends over? Were you fully isolated and the only adult person in each other's lives? (and whose idea this shit was if yes?)\n\nThe rule is actually making any kind of sense as \"introduce the new partner as a partner after 6 months\". Why can't she have an adult friend guest with other kids over? Or meet them in the park or any other activity? Or she can have any other person, except her potential partner? This is what is stupid. \n\nI don't get what other people are saying about kids attaching too early. If a kid is getting emotionally invested in any adult guest a parent invites, a kid has some kind of problem. Mom should have adult friends, and a kid should be used to seeing some random adults around. What's one more?", "NTA it is a good rule and should not be changed.

That forever is a lie.", "Agreed, but it should be NAH, right? Or do you think her asking is an asshole move?", "NTA this 100 percent. \n\nHonestly after 2 months she is just being selfish. There are 4 kids involved at 2 months you have no idea if this will work out. If you let 4 kids get attached to each other and the adults and you break up. Your hurting your kids.", "Totally agree! My ex and I did the same rule. Its helped shield the kiddos from non-lasting people.", "/u/IzzyBbyXXO I totally agree with you and with this sentiment/action!! It's too many young children who have sadly become unalived due to the partner their parent chose and didn't vet properly. Just bringing anyone and everyone around their kids and their house. I'm convinced that at least some of these children (even if it's a small percentage) would still be with us if their parent had thought and handled their relationship this way. \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25 OP is NTA for sticking to this rule!!!", "But is she an asshole for asking? She's not doing it behind his back, she was asking. Shouldn't the ruling be NAH?", "It\u2019s also what\u2019s been recommended for years, my parents had it back in the 90s!

They made this agreement, if she can't stick to it, that's her problem.", "This!", "I think this is the correct answer here.", "> Well, \"this is Mummy's new friend, he has kids, wanna play with them?\" is very much not that. I think framing it that way to your ex - this is a meeting, not an Introduction Of New Parental Figure - would probably be helpful to all three of you.\n\nThis working as you intend would all be dependent on the ages of the kids. Saying you want to introduce your 6 year old to young teens to play wouldn\u2019t make sense.", ">this is a meeting, not an Introduction Of New Parental Figure\n\nI agree with this bit.  I waited 6 months to really let a new partner into my kids' lives, but the kids met them before that (usually around the point that we were becoming less casual).  My partner met my kids on Halloween and went trick-or-treating with us, about 3 months after we started dating.  I needed to make sure he got along with them, because if he'd been a jerk around the kids, I didn't want to take it any further.  \n\nAlso, flexibility is crucial in co-parenting.  Both parents are going to want renegotiations on various things over the years.", "Musical partners is horrible for children.", "Except plenty of people have a revolving door of \u201cserious\u201d partners and they are all serious for three months and then they\u2019re gone, which is horrible for kids.", "She asked if he would change his mind, he said no. He didn't say anything about enforcing the rule, just that he wouldn't change his mind when she asked.", "The six month thing is a pretty standard suggestion from the people they send you to talk to when you get divorced to help you learn how to not mess up your kid. Which is organized by the courts. So clearly the courts think it\u2019s quite reasonable to have some say in how the other person parents in this sense.", "Look, I get your reasoning here.  I've argued similarly in other AITA posts.  But I don't think you've got the right verdict here, specifically because\n\n> We both agreed that our boy would not meet the new partner until we had been with them for 6 months.\n\nOP and coparent made an agreement, and OP has upheld it in good faith.  Coparent was not coerced into this agreement, and so it's reasonable to expect them to uphold it in good faith as well.", "> and will prevent your child from seeing his mom unnecessarily\n\nWhy?

I swore I was \"in love\" with my ex at 2 months. I dumped him at 6 months.", "I think her asking is a soft asshole move. They just broke up last year so the \u201c6 month\u201d rule was made fairly recent. If she had meant that as \u201c6 months unless I want to do it sooner\u201d then that\u2019s a different thing and not what she had agreed to!

The question is if he's TA by not changing the rule.", "I do think trying to introduce your kids to a random two month boyfriend is asshole behavior. The 6 month rule exists for a reason.
