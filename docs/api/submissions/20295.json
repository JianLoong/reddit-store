I would stick to the 6month rule.", "NTA! The \u201c6mo rule\u201d is in place for a reason, & its meant to keep weirdos outta ur kids lives! God forbid u wanted to break it\ud83e\udee3 it would be hell on surface", "I can see both sides but ultimately this is a rule you both agreed and made up together. And 2 months is awfully short.\nShe might feel serious, he might feel the same but the truth is she certainly doesn\u2019t know him on a deeper level yet, his real character, his finances, his friends and family relationships. Or if they are compatible in the longer term.\nNTA. As a compromise, you could offer to give her more alone time by keeping your kid for date nights ?", "NTA, 2 months together is basically no strings attached dating. It\u2019s not a long lasting relationship. There\u2019s a chance she could be kicked to the curb by her new boyfriend tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s in the kids best interest to stick to the rule. It makes sense, to protect your son.", "NTA.\n\nTwo months is not a long enough time at all. My parents used to get really intense about partners, have them around us and they would often start trying to parent us like idiots or they would be really nice to us and we would get really upset when they would break up a month or so later.\n\nSix months is a very sensible rule. My husband and I are still together but have said the same thing when discussing 'what if' scenarios. Both of us were affected by our divorced parents being serial daters when we were young.", "NTA, you both agreed to the 6 months rule when you were single and i feel like she may not be thinking \"straight\" because feelings are involved \n\nYou chose 6 months for a reason, you should stick to it", "You are NTA but there is probably not a lot you can do about it.  It is a good rule IMHO.  Might even say a year is better than 6 months. Kids don't need to see a constant parade of pseudo mommys and daddys parading through their houses and lives.  Kids get attached fast and will suffer if their parents' new relationships go sour.\n\nSlower the better.", "The point of the rule is that you don't introduce sixteen \"stepparents\" in three years, right? Well, \"this is Mummy's new friend, he has kids, wanna play with them?\" is very much not that. I think framing it that way to your ex - this is a meeting, not an Introduction Of New Parental Figure - would probably be helpful to all three of you.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but I do think you'd be wise to yield this one. Establishing a baseline of being flexible when it makes sense to be will help everyone in the long run. NAH.", "Definitely NTA. I have the same rule with my kids father and he's had 3 or 4 girlfriend and I don't know how many FWB in the 2 years we've been separated. He has continuously violated our rule and caused confusion and trauma with our children because of this.", "NTA. What if the kids become best friends and the parents break up? What if the kids absolutely hate each other and the parents get married? Not really a smart move to introduce them when there's loads of potential for negative consequences, especially way too early on. The rule was made to protect your son, and it should continue to do so. She's trying to manipulate it for her own sake, not for your kid's.", "I would\u2019ve said a year, but yeah, the rule needs to stand... Because I\u2019m most positive that if the roles were reversed, she would not be having it...", "NTA. How's there even time to date with kiddos to raise?", "NTA. Those rules exist for a reason. If the other children\u2019s mother is okay with them meeting your ex after 2 months, that\u2019s her decision to make. But you are still the father and you should have a right to say who meets your son. \n\nAlso, do you think she\u2019d give you grace if the roles were reversed?", "No Conflict here.  Your both adults, and as adults you both came up with these rules together, for the benefit of your child you have together.  Just because the rules that you both come up with at the moment don't benefit her, she still has to abide by the rules, because the rules are to protect your child.  It was the intent of the rules to protect your child, not to make it easier to date.  The rules you made are essentially a contract, don't break the rules, don't change the rules, don't amend them.\n\nYour child might make friends with this mans kids, they may not.", "NAH\n\nShe's not an AH for asking, and you aren't one for saying no. However, the obvious solution would be to arrange playdates for the children, of course without date like contributions from ex and date.", "INFO - does your ex get as much childfree time as you? It might be really hard for her to go on dates if she can only date without the child. I\u2019d also give her big kudos for actually communicating with you too", "Maybe I am wrong but I think soft YTA.\n\nI think that the length of time to be dating for you to introduce to kids is subjective. Sure 6 months makes sense when you sit down and agree to it, but 6 months of dating when you have kids and they aren't allowed to see them is really challenging.\n\nMost couples will just introduce their kids and ex to their partner when they feel it appropriate. Not after a set amount of time. Maybe say \"I'll be happy to change it just as long as I get to meet them first. I want to know the person you are introducing to our kids is good for them.\"\n\nI feel like denying her will create unnecessary drama. They will not be happy with you sticking to them waiting another 4 months to see the kids.", "YWBTA. Rules serve you, not the other way around. If the rule doesn't make much sense (like this being the first time, not a long pattern of behavior) then you should modify the rule. Coparenting is all about compromise, and this isn't an actual problem so far.", "YTA. It is 2 months not 2 weeks", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's single af and dates a lot and most of the time they stop seeing each other within a month. I didnt want my kids getting attached to a new adult and then having their hearts broken multiple times a year. My kids got to meet one girlfriend, we all went out to dinner and had a nice time!
