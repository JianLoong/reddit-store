One with her husband who doesn\u2019t have family money and my youngest daughter who is still a teenager. They both seemed uncomfortable as Mike put the bracelet on my daughter\u2019s wrist and she showed it off. \nI pulled Mike aside later and asked him from now on to give expensive gifts in private because my other daughters won\u2019t ever have anything that nice and he said \u201cNo, he\u2019s not doing that because Maddy can have whatever she wants and her family needs to get used to it\u201d I thought it was rude and I told my husband later after the party and he blew me off saying it makes our whole family seem petty and jealous that I said that. I said I was just taking into consideration of our other daughter\u2019s feelings and it\u2019s not an appropriate gift to give infront of other people. My husband said what\u2019s going to happen when the big engagement ring or wedding comes along? Am I going to be petty then because Mike is serious about Maddy.

A year long relationship isn\u2019t newish. You sound jealous of your daughter\u2019s good fortune, and it\u2019s rubbing off on your other girls. Maddy and her boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have to hide their lifestyle. This is how you drive people away.", "YTA\n\nIt's not flauting money for no reason.  The reason is it was her birthday and she got a gift.  \n\nWhat weird world do you live in where everyone is equal? Every group of siblings who are adults have someone who makes more money.  That's life.  \n\nAnd what a weird statement - your other daughters will never have anything nice.  \n\nFinances change.  People have nice things even if they aren't wealthy.", "YTA. Tf is wrong with u? \u201cMy other daughters won\u2019t ever have anything that nice\u201d Why are u thinking so low of them? And why so pissed that Maddy has someone who openly appreciates her? If anything as a mom u should show nothing but happiness towards her", "YTA. Your husband is correct. You are taking your feelings of inadequacy and projecting them onto your daughter. A healthy parent wants the best for their child and hopes they find someone who treats them like gold. Why don't you want that for her?\nYour other children should have learned by now that life is not fair and to be happy and celebrate others good fortunes.", "YTA. You seem jealous of your daughter and are projecting it onto her sisters.", "Yta\u2026your husband is spot on, 100% correct. Because you weren\u2019t in a position to give your kids things like that in their younger years, mike\u2019s present made YOU feel inferior. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by simply giving her a present for her birthday.  \n\nWhy is it Mike\u2019s problem thar your other daughters will never have anything that nice?  In fact how do you even know that?  Circumstances change.  You should be happy for your daughter and not jealous and petty.", "YTA\n\nLike everyone here is saying (because it's true): Your husband is right.\n\nMike isn't flaunting his money for \"no reason\", he just gave a special gift to his girlfriend... how did that idea get in your mind?", "Yta. You're being jealous and petty. What are you gonna do next...go-to the kids schools and demand that the other students aren't allowed to wear designer labels you can't afford for your kids? Maybe you should petition to bar the whole school from ever mentioning any gifts or vacations that are out of your budget so your kids will never have their feelings hurt. As a matter of fact...write to all the networks and insist they remove all commercials for items you can't afford and any programming/series must not depict any lifestyle you can't attain. That should prevent your kids from ever having their feelings hurt from being envious of others.\nOr you could just go get a 2nd 3rd and 4th job, sell some plasma, maybe work a street corner for some extra money and then you can buy a Tiffany bracelet too/s", "My mom used to do things like this. I was never allowed to shine because it might hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and I was never allowed to have the tiniest bit of spotlight on me. Even when I got pregnant with my first child she didn\u2019t want me to announce it because my sister was planning a wedding it it would \u201csteal the spotlight\u201d mind you her wedding wasn\u2019t for months so I was already showing by the time I was \u201callowed\u201d to tell people \n\nHe could have worded his response more politely but maybe he said it so bluntly because whether you\u2019re aware of it or not this might not be the first time you\u2019ve expected your daughter to fade into the background for the sake of others.", "Yta and you are jealous", "YTA, \n\nYou are petty and jealous.

That shade of green doesn't look good on anyone.", "YTA.\n\nthe entitlement and audacity to ask someone to hide that they can buy lavish gifts because it hurts your feelings is wild\u2026 that\u2019s absolutely not his problem nor your daughters. the only tacky thing was your behavior.", "yta - instead of being happy for your daughter on her bday that she found a great guy that loves to spoil her your jealous becuase u know your husband wont buy u a tiffany.  your husband is right wait til she gets engaged are you going to call them out becuase he can afford to buy her a ring and give her the world?  shame on you becuaes you should be elated that someone loves her and looks after her", "YTA\n\nYour other daughters can grow up and suck it up.

Don\u2019t park your new fancy car anywhere your sisters can see? Only have a low budget wedding. Don\u2019t buy your children anything too nice. \n\nYou overstepped and need to apologise to Mike.", "YTA and your husband is right. This is about your own insecurities about what you weren\u2019t able to afford and has nothing to do with Mike\u2019s behaviour. He did nothing wrong and you were the rude and inappropriate one when you asked him to hide his gift giving in future.", "YTA. You made a nice gesture awkward because you\u2019re insecure. Listen to your husband. Be happy for your daughter. It\u2019s just a bracelet, for goodness\u2019 sake!", "YTA.  You're asking your daughter and her bf to hide his money whenever he's around your family.  That's not healthy.  He's not flaunting his money by giving a birthday gift; he's simply not hiding it.  What will you ask next?  Should he buy a beater and wear cheap clothes when he visits?\n\nMoney is a nice thing to have, but it's not the only or even the most important thing.  If you're truly concerned about your daughters, teach them to put money in perspective, rather than trying to get people around them to pretend they don't have money.", "Fun fact! Your daughters WILL survive WITHOUT Tiffany jewelry. If you are all that pressed about not having access to luxury items, I suggest they, AND YOU seek treatment. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and a jealous one at that; you should be happy and thankful that your daughter found someone who not only loves her, but also is also willing to spoil her.

And why in God's name are you assuming that your other two daughters won't ever have anything similar? Does it have anything to do with the fact that *you* never got such expensive gifts before and now you *don't* why your daughters to have any either?", "YTA and you seem extremely jealous.

Maddy is allowed to be happy. YTA", "YTA. Your husband is right, you are petty and jealous.

Be happy for your daughter because if you carry on like this you're going to be shut out of her life.", "YTA \n\nYour request was tacky. If your other daughters want Tiffany so badly that their feelings are easily hurt by their sister\u2019s boyfriend giving her Tiffany, then they can level up and change their situations.

Was it a sterling silver bracelet with a \u2018Return to Tiffany\u2019 charm? \n\nIf it was a diamond tennis bracelet and each stone was 1ct I\u2019d agree with you and say \u2018mate, read the room\u2019. If it was the silver beaded \u2018Return to Tiffany\u2019 bracelet, it\u2019s about $280usd and not that expensive for a middle/upper middle class birthday gift between two people in a serious relationship. \n\nAre they supposed to host their wedding reception in a Denny\u2019s because that\u2019s what sister could afford for her wedding? Is he supposed to buy her a white topaz, gold filled engagement ring because her sister\u2019s husband couldn\u2019t afford a diamond? \n\nBe pleased for your daughter that she is in a happy relationship, and if any future grandchildren are raised more comfortably than their parents then isn\u2019t that what we all want for our kids?", "YTA.

I feel for your future grandchildren who I assume you will constantly be trying to \u201ceven the scales with their cousins\u201d. \nA Tiffany bracelet is nice, what are you going to do if he buys her a nice car? What about a nice house? Is she gonna keep those things in private too?", "Unexpected communism!", "Is there something you\u2019re not saying in this post? You mentioned that your other two daughters seemed uncomfortable, but it seems you were the one uncomfortable?

And you were awaiting the opportunity to pounce on Mike. YZA btw", "YTA. You are being petty and jealous. Not everyone has the same life experiences. It's sad that her getting something nice made other people uncomfortable. All of you should be happy for her, she found someone who loves her and can provide for her.", "YTA this is how you alienate your daughter and her bf/fianc\u00e9e/husband in the very near future. Eventually they\u2019ll do most of their celebrations in private without you and you\u2019ll wonder why. Probably end up bad on Reddit asking where you went wrong.
