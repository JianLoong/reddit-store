They both seemed uncomfortable as Mike put the bracelet on my daughter\u2019s wrist and she showed it off. \nI pulled Mike aside later and asked him from now on to give expensive gifts in private because my other daughters won\u2019t ever have anything that nice and he said \u201cNo, he\u2019s not doing that because Maddy can have whatever she wants and her family needs to get used to it\u201d I thought it was rude and I told my husband later after the party and he blew me off saying it makes our whole family seem petty and jealous that I said that. I said I was just taking into consideration of our other daughter\u2019s feelings and it\u2019s not an appropriate gift to give infront of other people. My husband said what\u2019s going to happen when the big engagement ring or wedding comes along? Am I going to be petty then because Mike is serious about Maddy.

The reason is it was her birthday and she got a gift.  \n\nWhat weird world do you live in where everyone is equal? Every group of siblings who are adults have someone who makes more money.

He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by simply giving her a present for her birthday.  \n\nWhy is it Mike\u2019s problem thar your other daughters will never have anything that nice?

You're being jealous and petty. What are you gonna do next...go-to the kids schools and demand that the other students aren't allowed to wear designer labels you can't afford for your kids? Maybe you should petition to bar the whole school from ever mentioning any gifts or vacations that are out of your budget so your kids will never have their feelings hurt. As a matter of fact...write to all the networks and insist they remove all commercials for items you can't afford and any programming/series must not depict any lifestyle you can't attain. That should prevent your kids from ever having their feelings hurt from being envious of others.\nOr you could just go get a 2nd 3rd and 4th job, sell some plasma, maybe work a street corner for some extra money and then you can buy a Tiffany bracelet too/s", "My mom used to do things like this. I was never allowed to shine because it might hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and I was never allowed to have the tiniest bit of spotlight on me.

You're asking your daughter and her bf to hide his money whenever he's around your family.  That's not healthy.  He's not flaunting his money by giving a birthday gift; he's simply not hiding it.  What will you ask next?  Should he buy a beater and wear cheap clothes when he visits?\n\nMoney is a nice thing to have, but it's not the only or even the most important thing.

If your other daughters want Tiffany so badly that their feelings are easily hurt by their sister\u2019s boyfriend giving her Tiffany, then they can level up and change their situations.

If it was the silver beaded \u2018Return to Tiffany\u2019 bracelet, it\u2019s about $280usd and not that expensive for a middle/upper middle class birthday gift between two people in a serious relationship. \n\nAre they supposed to host their wedding reception in a Denny\u2019s because that\u2019s what sister could afford for her wedding? Is he supposed to buy her a white topaz, gold filled engagement ring because her sister\u2019s husband couldn\u2019t afford a diamond? \n\nBe pleased for your daughter that she is in a happy relationship, and if any future grandchildren are raised more comfortably than their parents then isn\u2019t that what we all want for our kids?", "YTA.

A dictatorship is a very efficient form of government, and serfdom can generate lots of money to build an army. But it does not make that form of government good for the average person.", "Propaganda? I would say it\u2019s more a thought provoking extrapolation of the logical (or in my mind illogical) result of pursuing socialism or \u201cequity\u201d policies", "The majority of humanity has been miserable and oppressed throughout human history.\n\nSuccessful doesn't necessarily mean enjoyable for the average person. (which is not to say you can't adopt a definition that equates the two, but you have to define your terms as such)", "To refer to the citizens of the USSR as serfs is majorly ahistoric. To say the citizens were miserable is wrong. Many did experince awful things. Many experienced a lot of success. Free education that was good. Standard of living was not uniform throughout the country. Genuinely, many people that are alive today had better lives back then.\nI will unambiguously agree with the oppressed. Certainly a dictatorship is oppressive, as well as many other elements of their government. Same as the US.", "Well, you'd be wrong, based on years of facts and history and data. But hey, you're welcome to hold an incorrect opinion that isn't based on facts or reason. Good luck with it.", "You obviously don\u2019t study history, which involves lots of \u201cfacts and history and data\u201d.  Keep believing it\u2019s the rider, and not the horse.", "Ah, yes, the projection there. \n\nAgain, good luck with that misguided set of beliefs. That's your issue, not mine.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yta instead of talking to the boyfriend, you should have encouraged your daughter (s) to be excited for their sister.", "YTA you sound like your the one who feels a certain type of way! If your husband gave you that present would you tell him to give you your stuff in private? Your daughter found a wonderful man who wants to show her how much he cares and all your worried about is you and your daughters can\u2019t have what she has!", "Your such an ass. Jealous of Maddy probably her whole life by that reaction.", "Your husband is right. You are wrong. YTA. Leave Mike and your daughter\u2019s wonderful birthday gift alone.", "YTA. How would you have wanted this to go down? Should he have pretended to give a decoy gift for her birthday dinner? Should he have openly said that he would give it in private? Wouldn\u2019t the sisters then just get jealous later, when they found out what the gift was? Or did you want the gift to be a secret?", "YTA. It's so weird how offended you were that your daughter's boyfriend didn't immediately cave to your absurd attempt to dictate how he can show love. The boyfriend was right, he and Maddy decide what to do with their money, and her family (OP, at least. It seems like the husband thinks OP is overreacting too) does need to get over it.", "Good for Mike!", "YTA - as an older sister, I hope my sister\u2019s future partner spoils her and gives her everything she wants. We grew up poor, and I\u2019d be VERY happy if she found someone who could provide for her. (Of course, be her friend/trust/love is all more important than monetary gain, but sisters being jealous of a Tiffany bracelet is gross)", "YTA. A jealous one at that.", "YTA - and your daughters are just going to have to get used to the fact that sometimes other people get things they don\u2019t get.  It\u2019s a big lesson - I am surprised that you have not learned that lesson yet yourself.", "YTA.  Oh, no, he got her a present for her birthday and her sister's (one of whom is a whole ass adult!) are jealous and can't handle it.   Your husband is right...what ARE you going to do when the big engagement ring and lavish wedding come?", "YTA And your husband was right, it was very tacky. Please apologize.", "YTA. While I get what you mean or come from, the married couple can prioritize their finances however they want (house, number of kids/pets, cars) and the younger can learn what a healthy relationship looks like and decide if she finds that to be excessive or something to aspire to. Idk how much money it is, but it\u2019s not that different from someone buying a 2024 car vs a 2018 car vs 2014 IMO. People prioritize it differently even if they don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it.", "YTA. What happens when your other daughter's friends get nice gifts from their SOs at parties? Do you take that SO aside and tell them that bit should have been done privately? If one of the daughters or their husbands get a huge promotion or win the lottery do they have to keep that quiet so they don't upset you and your lack of money? It's not about the daughters, this is about you and your feelings of insignificance.", "YTA. Maddy has a right to have nice things, Mike has the right to buy his girlfriend a piece of jewelry. You should be happy for your daughter, but instead you come off as controlling and jealous. If you want to lose Maddy, keep it up and you'll succeed.", "YTA\n\nYour husband was exactly right. Being jealous of a family members good fortune is disgusting.", "YTA.  Where did you even get this idea?", "YTA\n\nFirst - he\u2019s not a newish boyfriend. They\u2019ve been dating a year, that\u2019s a significant amount of time.  \n\nSecond, you sound petty and jealous.", "YTA and also don't know what is a paragraph.", "Yta I bet she is your least favorite. You sound a lot like the evil step mother from Cinderella mad because your other daughters don\u2019t have a bracelet", "YTA, I think you are jealous you don't get things from Tiffany's.", "You're being petty. That's a really weird and inappropriate request.", "YTA.  Clearly there are issues you need to work on.  Do that and leave your daughter's boyfriend out of it.", "YTA it\u2019s not mikes fault y\u2019all can\u2019t afford nice things. You sound jealous af", "YTA.. and jealous af. Your husband is right. You made the whole family look petty and jealous. If you continue this shit, expect your daughter to cut you out of her life. You\u2019re making her the scape goat because her boyfriend wants to show his love in ways he can afford. Also.. a year isn\u2019t a \u201cnewish boyfriend \u201c..", "YTA\n\nYou're trying to shame your daughter's boyfriend for giving a gift. It's no one's business how expensive it is. Not everything from Tiffany's is off-the-charts expensive. Your other daughters may or may not ever have \"anything that nice.\" They may get great jobs. Their husbands might. They may not care. It's none of your (or their) business.", "Exactly, this whole situation is really weird to me.", "Exactly. Can\u2019t they just be happy for her?

You use a lot of words to say very little in your tantrum.", "Don\u2019t know where you live, but hopefully you never live under a socialist regime.", "Australia. And there's nothing I'd love more for Australia to adopt a socialist economic system. Feel free to give actual points as to why that's bad. Extra points if it's not \"human nature\" or another American propaganda machine creation. Communism is NOT above criticism, I have my own, but yours haven't been particularly sturdy. Basically \"trust me bro, country bad\" with very little historical consideration that isn't \"I already dislike communism and now where is bad?\"", "So what is your preferred level of socialism? What level of taxes is too much? What level of private ownership should be allowed - real property? Only personal property? How about inheritance laws? Should people be able to pass assets to their children? If so how much? The devil is in the details, cause who is going to strive if you take 70%+ away from them?"]}
