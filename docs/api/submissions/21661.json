They both seemed uncomfortable as Mike put the bracelet on my daughter\u2019s wrist and she showed it off. \nI pulled Mike aside later and asked him from now on to give expensive gifts in private because my other daughters won\u2019t ever have anything that nice and he said \u201cNo, he\u2019s not doing that because Maddy can have whatever she wants and her family needs to get used to it\u201d I thought it was rude and I told my husband later after the party and he blew me off saying it makes our whole family seem petty and jealous that I said that. I said I was just taking into consideration of our other daughter\u2019s feelings and it\u2019s not an appropriate gift to give infront of other people. My husband said what\u2019s going to happen when the big engagement ring or wedding comes along? Am I going to be petty then because Mike is serious about Maddy.

A year long relationship isn\u2019t newish. You sound jealous of your daughter\u2019s good fortune, and it\u2019s rubbing off on your other girls.

The reason is it was her birthday and she got a gift.  \n\nWhat weird world do you live in where everyone is equal? Every group of siblings who are adults have someone who makes more money.

He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by simply giving her a present for her birthday.  \n\nWhy is it Mike\u2019s problem thar your other daughters will never have anything that nice?

You're being jealous and petty. What are you gonna do next...go-to the kids schools and demand that the other students aren't allowed to wear designer labels you can't afford for your kids? Maybe you should petition to bar the whole school from ever mentioning any gifts or vacations that are out of your budget so your kids will never have their feelings hurt. As a matter of fact...write to all the networks and insist they remove all commercials for items you can't afford and any programming/series must not depict any lifestyle you can't attain. That should prevent your kids from ever having their feelings hurt from being envious of others.\nOr you could just go get a 2nd 3rd and 4th job, sell some plasma, maybe work a street corner for some extra money and then you can buy a Tiffany bracelet too/s", "My mom used to do things like this. I was never allowed to shine because it might hurt someone else\u2019s feelings and I was never allowed to have the tiniest bit of spotlight on me.

You're asking your daughter and her bf to hide his money whenever he's around your family.  That's not healthy.  He's not flaunting his money by giving a birthday gift; he's simply not hiding it.  What will you ask next?  Should he buy a beater and wear cheap clothes when he visits?\n\nMoney is a nice thing to have, but it's not the only or even the most important thing.

If your other daughters want Tiffany so badly that their feelings are easily hurt by their sister\u2019s boyfriend giving her Tiffany, then they can level up and change their situations.

If it was the silver beaded \u2018Return to Tiffany\u2019 bracelet, it\u2019s about $280usd and not that expensive for a middle/upper middle class birthday gift between two people in a serious relationship. \n\nAre they supposed to host their wedding reception in a Denny\u2019s because that\u2019s what sister could afford for her wedding? Is he supposed to buy her a white topaz, gold filled engagement ring because her sister\u2019s husband couldn\u2019t afford a diamond? \n\nBe pleased for your daughter that she is in a happy relationship, and if any future grandchildren are raised more comfortably than their parents then isn\u2019t that what we all want for our kids?", "YTA.

What the crap?\n\nYTA", "YTA and i\u2019m 100% sure that his reaction is because he knows that you\u2019ve pulled this type of shit with your daughter to keep her from shining before.", "Listen to your husband for once.", "if your other daughters would be upset by their sister getting a nice gift then that would not reflect well upon them or on you. \n\nsoft YTA it sounds like you feel it makes you look bad or something that you couldn't afford that, if they're decent (not materialistic) people they won't care about that stuff.", "YTA, your husband is correct, you are being petty and jealous and reflecting poorly in your family.  Teach your other daughters to be gracious, ffs. Them having less shouldn't mean Maddie never getting more. What's next, Maddie can't wrar the bracelet around her sisters? Come in.", "YTA - What Mike did was completely within reason. Just because he comes from a different socio-economic background is no reason to give a gift privately, no matter what the gift. In addition, why wouldn\u2019t you want your youngest daughter to see her older sister receiving a nice gift. It may help her set her life standards.\n\nPut your own feeling of inadequacy aside and suck it up.", "YTA Your daughters are old enough to understand some people have more money than others. I assume they have the emotional capacity to accept that and be happy for their sister rather than jealous and inferior because they don't have diamond bracelets. \n\nYour daughter and her boyfriend shouldn't have to hide or be ashamed of their financial situation any more than your daughter with less money should. She should feel loved and welcomed by her family regardless of whether she has nice things or not. \n\nIf you push your daughter away by trying to shame her boyfriend for being good to her, who do you think she will choose? The person who obviously has her best interests at heart or the person who thinks no one should have more than they do and would rather be controlling and restrictive than happy for her? You could end up with a son in law who is financially stable and prioritizes taking care of your daughter, and who knows, might even buy you nice gifts someday for making him part of your family. Or you could end up with one less daughter because she's off living her best life without you trying to drag her down. \n\nYou should use this as an opportunity to teach your teenager that while having designer jewelry is nice, it's not as nice as having a loving and supportive family. And that if she wants designer jewelry, she absolutely can pursue a career that would allow her to buy herself nice things. \n\nHonestly, you are more of an asshole for saying none of your daughter's are capable of making enough money to afford nice jewelry. Like, great job mom. I'm sure that makes them feel super protected and not at all inferior.", "YTA they\u2019re not shoving their money in your face he\u2019s showing  that he appreciates your daughter and for you to try to take away from her birthday by focusing more on her sister is weird it\u2019s her birthday so her boyfriend can get her what he wants.

One year relationship and the word newish don\u2019t go in the same sentence. \n\n2. Your husband is right, what if they get engaged or married? Is he supposed to get a ring comparable with your other daughters ring ? Does their wedding have to be comparable to your other daughter wedding?\n\n3. I don\u2019t think the sisters are the ones uncomfortable and jealous, I think you are the ones that\u2019s jealous and are using your daughters as a security net for your feelings. You\u2019re trying to minimize the relationship and projecting your insecurities onto your other daughters.\n\n4. What makes you think your other daughters won\u2019t have nice things as well? Also they can and will survive in the world without getting a Tiffany\u2019s bracelet.\n\n5. I\u2019m in the same situation as maddy so I\u2019m going to use some examples : My engagement ring is from Tiffany and I\u2019m absolutely scared to ask for the price,does that mean that my engagement shouldn\u2019t have happened in front of my family and that I shouldn\u2019t wear my ring in front of them and just buy one from pandora to wear around them?  I also live in a penthouse in NYC ,great views btw, my sister lives in a studio apartment in Spain,does this mean that my sister can\u2019t come over to my place and spend time with me? Just because I now live a privilege life doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m hurting anyone\u2019s feelings because we\u2019re all adults and we all have different wants and paths in life or are you saying that I shouldn\u2019t have dated my partner if I wasn\u2019t sure if my sister was going to get the same privileges? What if my sister is the privileged one in her relationship and she\u2019s just starting out?", "YTA and I think you know it. Instead, you were hoping strangers would back up your thought process.. instead, now you're just telling the story to try to get you to believe your own justifications. You're jealous and your daughters are jealous. Maybe you should focus on how to deal with your feelings and learn how to teach the other girls how to deal with this feeling.

You should want this for her. \nIf your daughters get upset when other people receive gifts for things like birthdays in front of them, you did something wrong. \nI had a cousin who, when we were kids, she would throw an absolute FIT when anyone got anything that she didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t matter if it was THEIR birthday or Christmas, she would cry until someone bought her a matching gift. I remember my parents made me give her some of my Christmas presents one year to make the drama stop- as an adult she doesn\u2019t cry for things she wants, but she\u2019ll stir the pot and make people feel bad, and she \u201cborrows\u201d things now and never returns them. If you raised your daughters to feel entitled to everything everyone else has, you screwed up.", "YTA, this is a you issue. I wonder how your kids would feel about all this if they found out?", "YTA.

My family could not afford that. But if one of sister bf could I would be over the moon for her. Not jealous", "YTA\n\nSpending within your means isn't flaunting your money. He never made a big deal about the value or, seemingly, the gift. He just got his gf a bracelet and gave it to her. Sounds lovely.\n\nAnd \"newish\" boyfriend of one year? Sweety, in what world is he new?\n\nI could not afford to give a partner a bracelet like that, no matter how much I wanted to. If my sibling gave theirs one in front of me, you know how little I'd give a shit? Why the fuck would I care, it's not my gift. Has nothing to do with me. Until he actually does or says something to insult or belittle, this is all just you and your family having wasteful insecurities.", "YTA perhaps you as a mother should be teaching your daughters to build their sister up and be happy for her instead of jealous.

He wasn\u2019t throwing $100 bills on the table. He just gave her a gift as all of you did. \n\nYour husband is right, it made you look jealous and petty. Honestly, you made an impression that you can\u2019t take back. Will you throw a tantrum if somehow their wedding is different from their siblings. People have different chances and finances in life.

The cheapest bracelet is $195USD. There are also several other bracelets for under $500USD, which seems like the average person might be able to save to buy.

Wtf this is one hateful mother", "Right? A year is plenty of time for this couple to have a whole dynamic that isn\u2019t the mother\u2019s business.

They need to learn eventually that some people will have more expensive things than you.

It\u2019s better that they get this lesson now before the real world hits them like a ton of bricks.\n\nBut the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything points to the possibility that they don\u2019t actually have a problem.
