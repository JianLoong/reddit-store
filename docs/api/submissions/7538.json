For context, my mom tried to teach my son to say mama, hoping that he would learn it and say it to me. He called her mama first, and so I started saying \"mama\" a lot to him, and he said it to me. Then I trained him to say \"Gamma!\" whenever she appeared. I also thanked her for teaching him \"mama\" and asked, now that he was saying it, that she only use it when I appeared, so he wouldn't get confused. She was surprised and then quickly realized her error, and modified her behavior. I share this as an example of a reasonable behavior and response. Your MIL is not acting or responding in a reasonable way. You have every right to insist that your child call you mama, and call Grandma by whatever cute approximation of grandma that her grandchild comes up with.", "NTA your husband needs to tell his mom to stop why is he not stopping her? They are both AH's", "Husband needs to be stepping up here. It's semi common that a grandma will do this.

This should make it a deal breaker to have her around your kid or babysit", "Of course it doesn't bother him, she's not trying to teach the baby to call her dada.", "Tell her that it\u2019s either she stops or that the kids will be calling her Nana Gertrude. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As her mother, it\u2019s completely within your rights to not want your daughter to not call someone else mama. You wanting your husband to speak to his mother about it instead of ignoring the situation is not out of line at all. It\u2019s his mom causing the problem so he should be speaking with her about it, especially knowing how you feel.", "NTA.  That is disrespectful as all hell.  She is NOT mama!  Thay needs to be stopped, and your husband needs to step up, and stop his mom.", "Nta! And go nc with his mother till she learns that she can't do it. Your partner needs to step up", "NTA she either stops or she stops seeing her grandchildren imo. She\u2019s definitely doing it on purpose to they call her mama which is so so wrong.", "NTA tell her to stop it or you won't let her see the kid.", "NTA - Lol. I think you should teach her to call MIL \"daadee\", the Hindi word for grandma.", "NTA. But I would get some photos of Granny and teach your kid that this is Grandmother.", "Nta, tell your husband he needs to address to fix this or you do not want mil coming around. I am not one for ultimatums but you may need to with your husband.", "NTA. This is just weird controlling behavior.", "NTa but stop seeing her so much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are very young. Maybe your mom is still used to being called mom? No matter what, she has some growing up to do. She\u2019s grandma, memaw, Gigi, meme, Nina, grammie, abuela, mor- mor\u2026etc.", "NTA.  Sounds like Grandma has a few issue.  It doesn\u2019t make sense that your husband doesn\u2019t back you up in this.  What is going on between your husband and his mother?  There must be some reason your husband won\u2019t stand up to grandma.  Have you asked her what she would like the baby to call her?  What does she say?  Maybe she would rather be called something odd like meemaw.  I do not blame you for wanting to be the only mama.  You will probably need to be on continual alert and always refer to MIL as grandma.  Correct grandma as often as necessary. I might be afraid to leave the baby alone with grandma if she continues with this nonsense.", "NTA it would be fine if she was teaching your kid that you were mama, but teaching them that she is mama is just disrespectful especially when you told her to stop", "NTA at all. It sounds like there is something more psychological going on than she's letting on. Best case scenario she's going to end up confusing your daughter like she did with your son. This is absolutely something you can and should have boundaries about. But your husband is going to need to be on board with it unfortunately.", "I would kick her out of my damn house!!", "NTA. My grandma did this to where her grandma name was \"mama\" for me, my siblings, and 3 of our cousins. My mom was so made at this and didn't want us calling her mama. Butt if she did anything about it, it didn't take. Also didn't help that grandma watched us during the day from the time we were babies till we started school. Grandma would also call us \"her babies\" and treated us like her kids.\n\nIf you do not want your kid calling her that, then you need to be proactive about it and constantly correct and/or limit contact till the little one is able to call her something else.", "NTA. This is incredibly inappropriate. Hubby needs to step up.", "NTA. Why do they do this?? I\u2019ve been there and you\u2019re right to call her on it. My MIL went on for years, long before we had kids about how, if we ever did, she was to be called Nana. It was a whole thing. So eventually we have a baby. She\u2019s Nana. She finds out I\u2019m going to refer to myself as Mama instead of Mommy, to the baby. All of a sudden she starts rethinking her title and asking if I think she should go by Mam\u00e1 instead of Nana??? It was very WTF bc there\u2019s no cultural reason at all for any of us for her to have an accent on anything in the first place, let alone having my child call her something that literally is the word for mom and it was just so bizarre.", "NTA.  Your MIL needs therapy.", "NTA- do not allow her to be around your children.", "So even though your son was taught to call her mama, he doesn't anymore? This is something that will clear itself up with time. Maybe correct the child (when this happens in your presence) with \"I'm mama and she's nana\". I don't think this worth making an issue of but please yourself...\n\nNAH... not really.\n\nETA: On the other hand, your husband not taking your worries serious is more problematic.", "OP, please teach the baby to call her dada!\n\n(I'm kidding, but it would be hilarious.)\n\nNTA.  Your MIL needs to stop this or she needs to stop seeing your children.  She is Not The Mama.", "V", "Oops, don\u2019t know", "NTA that is very disturbing thing to do.", "NTA\n\nWhen your child is that young, then you should get to decide what they call you. Grandma gets to pick from everything else. Sooner or later, your child may decide what name THEY want to give you and grandma.\n\nThese are nicknames and terms of endearment, not immutable brands. I think you'll be happier in the long run if you don't take it that seriously, but your husband should be backing you at this stage.", "She\u2019s definitely doing it on purpose and that\u2019s annoying but I would try to rise above it. She\u2019ll never replace you in their life, even you you passed away you\u2019re their mum, let her be weird and petty. NTA"]}
