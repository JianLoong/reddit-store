My SIL (18F) has been living with us for 4 months. She's a freshman in a community college and ever since going there, she's been staying with us. She will continue to do so until she graduates.

(We live in Asia and it's typical for parents and family members to support children until they finish college.)\n\nI am a freelancer working from home, whereas my husband is an office worker. I earn way more than what my husband does, so it's expected that I shoulder most of the bills and groceries. I also do most of the chores at home while I work 10 hours a day. This is fine with me since I do love maintaining a clean home especially cooking, but when my SIL moved in, I expected her to help. \n\nIf I didn't cook, we don't eat. They are always waiting for me to make dinner and never once did my SIL make dinner ever since staying with us. She doesn't even do the dishes every after meal. A lot of times that I do it after cooking the food we eat. I kind of expected that as a courtesy, she'll help with the dishes. This is how I and my siblings were raised. The only chore she does is her own laundry. \n\nMy husband also does all the yardwork. It's my SIL that doesn't do anything at all to help in the house. \n\nOne Saturday, I went out to go grocery shopping and bumped into a friend. We decided to eat out at a nearby restaurant to catch up. When I got home, I put away the groceries and went ahead and watched TV. My husband asked me what's for dinner and I said I already ate so I'm not cooking anything. My husband was ok with it and ordered dinner for him and SIL. \n\nThe next day, I also did not make anything. Husband asked why there's no dinner yet and it's already 7 PM. I said I wasn't hungry and was skipping dinner, so I didn't cook anything. This time, my husband was pissed and called me selfish. I answered back and said I am not their servant and they both are adults capable of making their own dinner. I also added I am so tired of doing everything and them (my SIL actually) not helping. Husband asked why I didn't say anything if I was so tired. I know it's my fault for not communicating this particular issue with him or SIL, but I just thought that it shouldn't be something that I needed to tell them. And besides, I am not comfortable demanding my SIL myself to do chores. \n\nThis is the part where I might be the AH. I only have an issue with SIL, but then I flipped out at the wrong person.\n\nMy SIL heard everything and apparently told my MIL about it because I've been receiving nasty messages from her calling me an AH. \n\nI don't know how to move past this. I wish I could have dealt with my frustrations differently. I and my MIL have always had a good relationship, so this whole situation is so stressful to me. I am contemplating on just apologizing to all of them. Am I really the AH in all of this? :(\n\nEDIT 1: Thank you very much for taking time to share your thoughts. I do agree with all of you and understand why some of you may find my post a little bit sexist. For context, I was raised in a traditional Asian household where wives are supposed to do cooking, cleaning, laundry... etc and husbands do yardwork, carpentry, and the like. My mom doesn't even want my husband doing chores inside the house when she comes over. I didn't realize it was really a problem until now. It's now 2023, and I agree this needs to change.\n\nEDIT 2: It's been days since it happened, but we haven't addressed the elephant in the room yet. My husband has been buying takeouts and we're just being civil with each other right now. I will initiate the conversation one of these days after I have gone through all your comments as I want to do it in a way that it will be resolved as quickly as possible.

However things have changed in recent times. When I got married I also made substantially more than my husband and we used to pay for bills equally. Even housework we used to share equally. \n\nYou need to have a polite and nice conversation with your husband first.

Hear what he has to say and politely suggest on how to split chores as you need more help from them.\n\n E.g. my husband can't cook so I used to cook he used to do the dishes. I would put clothes for washing in the machine and he used to put out for drying. \n\nI feel deep down you resent your SIL staying as she is not helping or is being supportive plus since you are paying for majority of expenses you are not liking paying for your SIL which is fair. Your husbands bias towards his sister wont go. This feeling of yours is unlikely to go away. The best outcome you are likely to get is your husband to help you with chores. I doubt if he ll say anything to his sister considering he is ordering takeout but not asking her to cook already. Don't be aggressive or pushy in first conversation.
