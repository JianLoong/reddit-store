It's completely normal for roommates to pay different amounts based on bedrooms of different sizes or having different amenities.  And in your case it was definitively agreed upon.", "NTA, but have you considered that by going back to the previous agreement you had that means you would pay more but you'd also get the bigger room back.\n\nHe sounds very dense but if he wants the old agreement back, that means all of the old agreement should come back not just the paying more part.", "NTA \n\ninvest in a mini fridge and avoid their groceries just get whatever it is you need", "NTA, \nIf you agreed to something, you stick to that agreement. It\u2019s the boyfriend\u2019s issue for having a problem with the agreement you guys made. I think just a simple discussion is needed in the house on how the payments are being split to sort it out", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't make sense. And doesn't seem to have anything to do with you. \n\nThe sister and boyfriend are splitting a bedroom, are they splitting the rent for the second biggest room or is he paying for everything?\n\nAre the friend and sister not contributing to the groceries?", "NTA. It\u2019s common that whoever stays in the smaller room pays less rent", "NTA.\n\nAlso, this is why you always have an agreement IN WRITING before anyone moves into a shared living arrangement.\n\nThings like the cost of each room, what utilities are shared or not, what chores folks do, what's part of the common house fund vs. separate... this really needs to be hammered out.\n\nBoyfriend + friend sister moved in last and unless everyone re-arbitrated the arrangement, he does not get to unilaterally get to change the agreement. Also, typically everyone shares in utilities like Internet and common goods like TP/soap, but buys individual groceries.\n\nI don't think living with the couple is going to be compatible tbh.", "NTA this is pretty common", "NTA. The rent is a separate bill and the amount is set without relation to any other bills. If he has a beef about you not paying enough for groceries then ya'll need to discuss how much each person pays for groceries,  not change the rent. \n\nAlso theoretically he and his GF are already individually paying less than the rest of you because they theoretically split the rent between the two of them. So he should get over it.", "It does not matter how many rooms, in my opinion, the rental should be split by how many live there.  The BF shouldn't demand nor expect more then a quarter of the rent from you.   Then all house bills (gas, electricity and water) split by 4 also.    Groceries s/b individual cost and either label their food or buy it knowing roommates might eat some of it.   \n\nNow be aware that legal responsibility for paying is who signed the rental agreement? So if only you and the rest moved out they don't owe anything.  Must be in a contract and signed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is not your fault that the boyfriend feels he is being put out, tell him if he wants you to pay equal share again you will take back the room you gave up for them.", "NTA absolutely not. Tell them if they keep insisting then you can move out and they can split it 3 ways and pay way more, bet he'd love that idea.", "NTA\n\nHopefully the agreement is written down somewhere, even if it\u2019s in text message or email. That\u2019ll be your fallback in case it becomes a legal issue. They can\u2019t be changing terms without your agreement just because they make poor decisions which you have no play in. Remind them you didn\u2019t indulge on their food and as such not responsible for them overspending. If they keep on insisting you to pay more, may be wise to look elsewhere to move into", "NTA tell them no again you are in smallest room and that was the agreement. If they keep it up then tell them internet bill needs to now be split also. Point out what you pay for it alone and if that\u2019s not good enough you can change the password. Edit to add. Start buying your own groceries. Keep stuff separate labeled in fridge or buy a small fridge for room. Dry goods I\u2019d keep in my room. Especially since it sounds like you eat out most of the time.", "NTA\n\nYou should be paying a reasonable amount for the space you're using, covering the food you're eating (not necessary to split costs communally if you supply your food, covering your toiletries and things like cleansers and tp, and 1/4 of utilities.  From your description, what you're paying us probably fair.  It's not your responsibility to cover this couple's expenses because thevVF doesn't want to pay.", "NTA, time for a house meeting to reassess who pays what. IMO rent should be divided by bedrooms with a small price difference from largest to smallest room (the less the difference in price, the less people tend to care) and utilities should be divided by person. So if you've got a three bedroom with four people living there, rent would be divided by three with the couple splitting their rent due and utilities would be divided among all four. \n\nIf you already divide it this way, BF is a major AH for raising a stink about this considering he is already paying rent that has been fractioned into thirds and then halves. That's stupid cheap. \n\nIF rent is divided by four, I can understand why BF might be unhappy with this arrangement.", "I was gonna recommend this lmao", "Just from my experience splitting groceries caused a lot of tensions with me and former roomates over my years.  Least drama option I found was everyone does their own groceries, but things like condiments etc everyone pinches in on and then can use.", "I don\u2019t agree with always having to stick with an agreement\u2026 If the agreement is unfair. But this agreement seems fair. Since the rooms are not of equal sizes, everyone should not be paying equal rent. \nNTA", "we split rent 4 ways, with my friend paying extra on a flat rate with no bills and me paying less on a flat rate with a few of the bills, then the sister and her boyfriend split the rest of the rent and bill payments. That number usually ends up in between me and my friend but occasionally will reach how much my friend pays when the bills are high\n\n& im the only person who doesn't contribute to the groceries since I don't use much. I buy the sodas but never really much else", "as someone who's spent a lot of time looking at flatshares in the past (woohooo to living alone now), what I've observed is it's first split by rooms and size of room, but anyone advertising a room will have a price for single and a price for a couple (which is only a little bit more - so if 300 for a single, 340 for a couple) - after all they are an extra person using the bathroom, the living area etc - and then split the bills 4 ways.The bf is being ridiculous.", "Not allowing people to use your internet/streaming service anymore is a surprisingly effective way to end roommate disputes.", "Exactly. Offer to go fully separate on groceries (which is the only sensible arrangement as housemates imo). Then discuss again whether he wants to switch rooms back and switch rents out to keep the current arrangement. Of course it\u2019s insane to think that you\u2019d pay the same for a smaller room. If the utilities are split but not wifi, I would change the password and give them the option to split that cost if they want access again. They sound like bad housemates", "If the agreement is unfair, don\u2019t agree to it.", "Are you eating things you haven\u2019t purchased? Because then you should be chipping in for groceries. Even if you consider that you \u201cdon\u2019t use much\u201d you should still be paying for what you do use. Best course of action is to only eat things you have purchased yourself.", "Sometimes people don\u2019t realize agreements are unfair until later.", "I eat maybe $10-20 worth of their stuff a week, but they also drink the drinks I buy, so I feel like it's a fair trade", "So think about shit before agreeing to it?  \n\nIf you make an agreement with all the details readily available to you, you don\u2019t get to just change your mind later when you finally get around to reading those details and deciding you don\u2019t actually agree to them. The time to protest the rent agreement passed a long time ago.", "Unfortunately this is one of those places where shared groceries ends up being more trouble than it's worth.", "It\u2019s time to stop sharing. Tell them that you don\u2019t want them drinking your drinks and you\u2019ll buy your own stuff each week", "What used to be 10-20$ worth of groceries is 30-50$ these days. If you haven't done a full grocery shop in awhile you might not notice this. (Seriously, I kept my husband and my grocery bill around 60$/week for YEARS and now it is 120-150$ for the same types of foods.)\n\nImho, keep your sodas AND some snacks you buy in your room and don't eat the shared groceries.", "There may be new information. Or maybe the person didn\u2019t have a full grasp of things until later. Yes, you get to change the agreement if it is unfair. That\u2019s the moral standpoint. If you\u2019re on the other end, don\u2019t exploit a person\u2019s ignorance in making the agreement. That\u2019s morally fucked up."]}
