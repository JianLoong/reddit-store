He has three kids \u2018Marco\u2019 (16M), \u2018Ash\u2019 (15NB) and \u2018Finn\u2019 (13M). I knew of his kids since before we started dating but I didn\u2019t meet them until about 7 months into dating and was introduced as their dad\u2019s boyfriend after 1 year, after about another year I moved in with them. And about 3 months ago we moved into our current house.\n\nWe are a close family but the three bed house we lived in before just wasn\u2019t big enough. I\u2019m also a professional interior designer .\n\nthe kids went to stay with their mother for a few weeks so I decided to start on their rooms, so while we were doing the rest of the house they had their own spaces. In our new house each kid gets their own room. Each room was customised to each kids likes and they had also each made a mood board of their dream rooms before. This along with \u2018IKEA dates\u2019 had become our thing. So I knew about their design preferences\n\nSo I did their rooms. Marco\u2019s room was alternate with a gothic focus. We recreated the spiderweb window from Wednesday and a wall covered in posters and magazine clipping from a bunch of bands he likes that i sources.\n\nAsh\u2019s room was very different, they also had a big window to allow sunlight for their plants, they had an entire wall that was a floor to ceiling bookcase with a library ladder. The bed was a reading nook in the upper corner of the bookshelf wall.\n\nFinn\u2019s was a fantasy and gaming themed room, themed around genshin impact, the design was subtle, this included an accent wall which was a mural of some of the landscape form the game aswell as other hidden details.\n\nEach room had a secret room in it aswell as that was something all of the kids wanted. Marco had a rotating platform like form classic scooby doo shows. Ash of course had a hidden door in the book shelf. And since Finn had the smaller room we sectioned off part of the attic, converted it and added a hatch into his room. We still tried to make it cool by having a button that caused a rope to be dropped down for him to climb.\n\nwhen the kids got back today to say they were ecstatic would be an understatement. They loved their rooms and exploring all the little details. We did go shopping for some extra bits they wanted (there were a few ideas i had that I waited for their opinions) and it was all fun, or so I thought. I just got a call from their mother and as soon as I answered she started yelling at me, saying that I was doing this specifically to target her and the kids so that they wouldn\u2019t want to stay with her and that I was alienating them, I bearly got a word in before she told me that she will be talking to her lawyer about this and hanging up on me.\n\nIn the moment I only wanted to do something special for the kids, but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve messed up and it making my anxiety go crazy. I\u2019ve kinda just locked myself in our room bc ik my partner would notice immediately that I\u2019m not ok and I don\u2019t want to burden him.

Yeah, but she would have to prove it.  But alienation is more along the lines of telling the kids lies, like their mom doesn't love them, or want them.

And I'm grateful that they're loved and housed and fed and clothed and taken to where they need to go, as well as on holidays and all the rest of what being part of a family means.

I don\u2019t think it qualifies so morally - they split their time, you had a new house that had to be done up, and you did it to their liking. That reflects less alienation of the other parent and more ideal bonding of blended families. Plus, these kids are all old enough to not be so fickle that they can be bought with material things - teenagers are far more sensitive to the emotional atmosphere of their houses than to the availability of things. You did well.\n\nBut please talk to your partner - this is not OK and he needs to have a chat with his ex about this.", "NTA and btw can you drop by and give my room a makeover?", "It's her fault she feels inadequate.

I would love to get a customized room.", "NTA, just give yourself a minute, don't turn on your boyfriend, he's your support and will be facing this with you.

Criminal decorating with intent to alienate?..... Weird.", "NTA", "NTA, but you HAVE to burden him.   the crazy exwife threatening with lawyers is his burden to deal, he is supposed to know about that.  he is the one who is supposed to deal with her, not you", "NTA NTA NTA", "NTA.

And if she does call a lawyer they will tell her that any judge will laugh their ass of if they bring that before them.", "The only possible scenario where I could see this being uncool is it you did all the renovation while their dad was also away and you didn't tell him. But you say you worked on the rooms together with your partner, so that obviously that's not what happened. \n\nSo NTA. But you do need to talk to Adam about this. The kids' Mom will get laughed out of any court if she tries to claim alienation because the kids' Dad and stepdad decorated their rooms, but ultimately he is the one that will have to deal with any blowback from his co-parent. Just be there to support him if he needs you. But this is not your fault, and I'm 100% sure Adam won't blame you for his ex-wife being ridiculous.", "NTA. You need to talk to your partner about this especially since bio mom is talking lawyers. You did nothing wrong. Bio mom should be happy her kids have special rooms and are made welcome in your home. She\u2019s obviously feeling jealous. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. She\u2019s the AH for making that call and speaking to you that way", "NTA, aka the mom does not like that you made the kids Happy because she doesn't like that you have a relationship with them.\n\nIt sounds like the larger issue is that you have anxiety that you are not currently equipped to manage, and you need to create a new toolbox. First thing in that toolbox, is closing the line of contact between your partner's ex and you.

And just keep loving the kids as they deserve love and happiness. The bitter parent should be ashamed of herself trying to begrudge her kids such joy and more love in their lives. What parent would not want their kids to feel safe and loved.", "Nta and like... im a 40+ yo NB and would you adopt me? Cuz those rooms sound rad as hell.", "MOM has some issues she needs to deal with to be honest.  Also, you can come re-design my entire house, I need a secret room too, lol.....   You are going to have this type of thing happen often, so be prepared sorry to say.", "Wow, those sound like fantasy bedrooms. Literally. Pure fantasy.", "You are an angel sent from heaven. I love what you\u2019ve done for your kids. The mom is just jealous and petty. Don\u2019t worry about her.", "Info: Does the mother have enough money/is she receiving enough child support from your partner to maintain the same style of living for the kids at her place?", "But it must be at least 7 years prior?  I\u2019d say enough time has passed and the kids are old enough.  If they were all under 10 I\u2019d say a bit of caution would be needed but at this age they should be learning how to live.  \nOp, you nta big time.  Talk to them about your anxiety and how to work through and around it as is holding you back from being yourself!", "This but also make me a room.", "Once I read the hidden room in a room part I could no longer take it serious. Spinning platform? Right.", "Child support is supposed to not only cover basic expenses, but make the children's life conditions closer to the parent's (who has more money/comfort) too. This prevents the obligation you stated and also the risk of alienating the kids from the poorer parent.", "[removed]", "NTA. Great way to step up. \n\nBut you have to talk to your BF immediately. He needs to know what she said and he needs to talk to his lawyer. If she\u2019s being this irrational, you never know what she may be thinking up.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong but tell your partner what happened. The three rooms sound amazing from your descriptions. I would love to have a room like the one you decorated for Ash.", "NTA you are an incredible parent to these children, and it shows just how committed you are to them and their interests, and I think it's absolutely beautiful. Please talk to your partner about it, because you do not deserve to be mistreated by the mother. She is just insecure, which isn't an excuse to mistreat people the way she did. ESPECIALLY when said person is doing such incredible things for her children.", "NTA\n\nAlso, please drop pics of the rooms. Especially the book nook bed.", "NTA. I will take one Ash room for me whole you're here.", "NTA all communication should go through your partner. Block her and don\u2019t give it another thought.", "NTA. Let her talk to her lawyer, what will they say, yeah, you're terrible for making their rooms special to them and comfortable for their time there.", "NTA, you did a nice thing for your step-kids and they are over the moon. Tell your partner what happened so they're on the same page. Maybe let mom calm down a bit and then try to explain you didn't want to undermine her. All you wanted was to make these kids happy and happy they are. Maybe offer some support with adding some nice pieces to their rooms at her place, if you feel like she'd be receptive to that and not get offended at the offer.", "NTA you\u2019re actually a sweetheart.", "Your partner's ex just threw a grenade into his co-parenting relationship. YWB TA if you don't tell him about it ASAP.\n\nOtherwise, fuck her. Unless he sees her as an ATM, her lawyer's going to tell her to sit down and STFU.", "NTA. Their mom is a psycho", "NTA.  Hope that your kids tell their MOTHER how wrong she actually is.  Or their father.  I hope he has your back!", "NTA are you for hire?????

It was only many years later they realised that dad had decided that he didn't want to give child support to the ex wife since it was 'for the kids' so he was showering them with gifts and the child support came in the form of a Playstation while giving her nothing for rent or groceries or clothes for them. She couldn't sell their gifts and she could never give them treats of her own. She was really struggling and they just kept telling her 'Why can't you be more like Dad?' \n\nI don't for a second mean to imply that has any relation to OPs situation, or that the rooms were at the expense of child support, just that it is possible to alienate kids by giving them heaps of fun stuff you know the other parent can't afford. It sounds dumb but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a fairly common tactic.", "I was responding to a guy who played the \"anyone can sue\" card. OP is not getting sued over this. \n\nAlso, in this story, the Dad & OP/Boyfriend have been together for around seven years, so I'm guessing it's a little late to feature a divorce lawyer. She'd want someone specializing in family law. But that lawyer is still going to turn her down, because pissing off judges in Family Court is a terrible idea, and yeah, that pesky duty to not waste the courts time with frivolous bullshit that was mentioned earlier.", "I work at a family law firm. Lawyers absolutely keep score and good lawyers will not risk their reputations with family court judges on BS custody mods or contempt cases. They'll let you go Pro Se first.", "Right what would they say you made the kids too happy.", "For me there's not enough info.\n\nIt's definitely not ok for the ex-wife to right away call you the spouse (instead of her ex) & and dump her anger at you. \n\nHowever because there's a lot of info I don't know, & because I have the tendency to automatically assume the worst,  I do feel a tiny bit of empathy for her : \n\nFor Example :  Was she a stay at home mother during her past marriage with your husband ? Or does she have a vastly different income compared to both of you ?  If either is the case, I feel for her. Because teenager are so difficult to please & she is their mother, so she is held on a much difficult bar.  And you are a professional interior designer, so she definitely cannot measure up. I repeat it is absolutely not ok for her to be angry at you & dump her emotions on you. However I do relate to her in her feeling of inadequacy.\n\nI also say this because I was very difficult to my mother, I would expect her to know me much better than others. And it's only know in my 20s that I can understand how draining I was to her. Maybe I'm projecting...\n\nAlso : I don't know how the divorce went between your husband and his ex-wife. Was it a normal divorce ? or were they really too much incompatible & was a bad break up ?\n\nIs it the first time that you had such a difficult argument with her where she aggresses you like this ? Or does it happen often ? \n\nOr a worse question : was it a marriage where sexualities were not being honestly discussed ? I'm sorry to ask this but only a few month ago, it seems I kept reading awful reddit stories featuring women being lied to and used to make children so my brain made a leap.", "NTA and actually perfect holy, I wish a lot of step parents would be as enthusiastic about step kids", "Lol I am clearly the only person who will say YTA. But only for clearly making up a story that is not even that good. Let me laugh at designing and building these three rooms within \"a few weeks\".\n\nThat's not how this works. But nice fantasy at least, I guess.", "NTA keep being an awesome person", "NTA\n\nBut you need to tell your partner because his ex will bring this up.", "Pics please!!! Also NTA.

That\u2019s the best.\n\nI think it\u2019s unfair to you to sequester yourself away and not tell your partner about this threat from the children\u2019s mother though. I understand why she might be upset/jealous/what have you, as it\u2019s a somewhat normal reaction to not being able to provide for your children what others can, but at the end of all she should be happy they are safe and well taken care of when they are away from her home. That\u2019s the most important thing.\n\nCreating contention with you about taking care of her children too well is not going to have the desired effect. Not to stoke your anxiety further, but imagine she goes through with this threat and by some force of \u201cwhat the actual\u201d you have to redesign their rooms to something more traditional/bland\u2026 the kids would be crushed.

NTA.", "The first paragraph above is completely wrong, you are thinking personal injury lawyers.  This is family law.  Lawyers represent clients in return for money.  For the vast majority of legal work, that's billed on an hourly basis.  You have some dumbass legal argument you want to make, fine.  I'll tell you the odds of success are low then happily take your money to make it.  And since most cases settle and less than 2% of cases go to trial, no need to worry about stank.", "As I said earlier, I was responding to a dude's claim that 'anyone can sue for any reason'. I'd already noted elsewhere that this case in the OP (which is really not a case) would be family law.\n\n>You have some dumbass legal argument you want to make, fine. I'll tell you the odds of success are low then happily take your money to make it.\n\nReally? That's a good way to get a reputation with the Family Court judges for being a moron and a time waster. I don't see how losing a bunch of dumb cases helps your reputation with your clients, either. And also there's that duty to the court to avoid filing frivolous or false lawsuits. Seems like bad strategy, even if you win a few tactical points.", "You did such a nice thing for your step kids\u2026 father of the century right fucking here. NTA and never TA.

You did nothing wrong here and her lawyer will tell her she is being irrational.", "Okay you are not alienating the kids. She is upset because you could give them something she cannot. What you did was beyond spectacular and so appreciated by the kids. She is just mad. It\u2019s not as if you did this and in the meantime implied anything negative towards her. You could offer your services to help her at her house if she would be amenable. I doubt this would fly because it\u2019s just that you offer something she can\u2019t and is sad that they like you and what you did so much. NTA. She just needs to know that her kids love her still and that you just wanted them to have a space they were comfortable in.", "NTA btw", "Me to!
