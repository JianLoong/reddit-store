He has three kids \u2018Marco\u2019 (16M), \u2018Ash\u2019 (15NB) and \u2018Finn\u2019 (13M). I knew of his kids since before we started dating but I didn\u2019t meet them until about 7 months into dating and was introduced as their dad\u2019s boyfriend after 1 year, after about another year I moved in with them. And about 3 months ago we moved into our current house.\n\nWe are a close family but the three bed house we lived in before just wasn\u2019t big enough. I\u2019m also a professional interior designer .\n\nthe kids went to stay with their mother for a few weeks so I decided to start on their rooms, so while we were doing the rest of the house they had their own spaces. In our new house each kid gets their own room. Each room was customised to each kids likes and they had also each made a mood board of their dream rooms before. This along with \u2018IKEA dates\u2019 had become our thing. So I knew about their design preferences\n\nSo I did their rooms. Marco\u2019s room was alternate with a gothic focus. We recreated the spiderweb window from Wednesday and a wall covered in posters and magazine clipping from a bunch of bands he likes that i sources.\n\nAsh\u2019s room was very different, they also had a big window to allow sunlight for their plants, they had an entire wall that was a floor to ceiling bookcase with a library ladder. The bed was a reading nook in the upper corner of the bookshelf wall.\n\nFinn\u2019s was a fantasy and gaming themed room, themed around genshin impact, the design was subtle, this included an accent wall which was a mural of some of the landscape form the game aswell as other hidden details.\n\nEach room had a secret room in it aswell as that was something all of the kids wanted. Marco had a rotating platform like form classic scooby doo shows. Ash of course had a hidden door in the book shelf. And since Finn had the smaller room we sectioned off part of the attic, converted it and added a hatch into his room. We still tried to make it cool by having a button that caused a rope to be dropped down for him to climb.\n\nwhen the kids got back today to say they were ecstatic would be an understatement. They loved their rooms and exploring all the little details. We did go shopping for some extra bits they wanted (there were a few ideas i had that I waited for their opinions) and it was all fun, or so I thought. I just got a call from their mother and as soon as I answered she started yelling at me, saying that I was doing this specifically to target her and the kids so that they wouldn\u2019t want to stay with her and that I was alienating them, I bearly got a word in before she told me that she will be talking to her lawyer about this and hanging up on me.\n\nIn the moment I only wanted to do something special for the kids, but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve messed up and it making my anxiety go crazy.

Yeah, but she would have to prove it.  But alienation is more along the lines of telling the kids lies, like their mom doesn't love them, or want them.

And I'm grateful that they're loved and housed and fed and clothed and taken to where they need to go, as well as on holidays and all the rest of what being part of a family means.

I don\u2019t think it qualifies so morally - they split their time, you had a new house that had to be done up, and you did it to their liking. That reflects less alienation of the other parent and more ideal bonding of blended families. Plus, these kids are all old enough to not be so fickle that they can be bought with material things - teenagers are far more sensitive to the emotional atmosphere of their houses than to the availability of things. You did well.\n\nBut please talk to your partner - this is not OK and he needs to have a chat with his ex about this.", "NTA and btw can you drop by and give my room a makeover?", "It's her fault she feels inadequate.

I would love to get a customized room.", "NTA, just give yourself a minute, don't turn on your boyfriend, he's your support and will be facing this with you.

Criminal decorating with intent to alienate?..... Weird.", "NTA", "NTA, but you HAVE to burden him.   the crazy exwife threatening with lawyers is his burden to deal, he is supposed to know about that.  he is the one who is supposed to deal with her, not you", "NTA NTA NTA", "NTA.

And if she does call a lawyer they will tell her that any judge will laugh their ass of if they bring that before them.", "The only possible scenario where I could see this being uncool is it you did all the renovation while their dad was also away and you didn't tell him. But you say you worked on the rooms together with your partner, so that obviously that's not what happened. \n\nSo NTA. But you do need to talk to Adam about this. The kids' Mom will get laughed out of any court if she tries to claim alienation because the kids' Dad and stepdad decorated their rooms, but ultimately he is the one that will have to deal with any blowback from his co-parent. Just be there to support him if he needs you. But this is not your fault, and I'm 100% sure Adam won't blame you for his ex-wife being ridiculous.", "NTA. You need to talk to your partner about this especially since bio mom is talking lawyers. You did nothing wrong. Bio mom should be happy her kids have special rooms and are made welcome in your home. She\u2019s obviously feeling jealous. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. She\u2019s the AH for making that call and speaking to you that way", "NTA, aka the mom does not like that you made the kids Happy because she doesn't like that you have a relationship with them.\n\nIt sounds like the larger issue is that you have anxiety that you are not currently equipped to manage, and you need to create a new toolbox. First thing in that toolbox, is closing the line of contact between your partner's ex and you. She is hostile toward you so all contact need to go between your partner and his ex, or if you absolutely must have a line of contact open between the two of you, over one of those parenting apps where everything you guys say is recorded so there's consequences to her actions.\n\nSecond thing on the list, is you need to actually communicate with your partner. That is his ex, these are his kids, it is wrong for you to keep secrets from him because it's \"burdening\", him. It is not a burden for you to talk to him as your partner, as the father of these children, as the ex to this woman. It is absolutely his place to know what is going on and be a part of dealing with it. Communication is necessary and vital in general, but especially when you're talking about raising kids you need to be talking to your partner", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. You are obviously not alienating them on purpose and there\u2019s nothing a lawyer can do about it. You gave them something out of this world. Of course they will never want to leave. But I do feel for their mother. You flashed some cash and now her own kids don\u2019t want to go over anymore.", "I was so worried this was going to turn into the kids being AHs and not appreciating all of the hard work OP and his partner put into the room. I\u2019m so glad they were ecstatic as they should have been. The rooms sound amazing! \n\nNTA! You\u2019re building a family and making them feel wanted, loved and appreciated themselves. They aren\u2019t going to alienate their mom over room decor. If they alienate her, it will be because of her own behavior and jealousy. \n\nGood job OP!", "NTA. But I would be concerned if the kids told their mother that they don\u2019t want to spend time with her.", "NTA. She\u2019s bitter and jealous. That\u2019s not you\u2019re fault. Let her talk to her lawyer. Doubt the courts are going to care that the kids are being taken care of and being shown love!", "Sounds like the ex has issues -- that's her problem, not yours.", "Oh come on you know you are NTA", "Being a stepparent is a hard job. Especially when you're juggling everyone else's wants, needs, expectations, rules, boundaries and requirements. And, in your case, add in being gay and you're dealing with a whole lot of additional problems and biases. From what I can tell, you're doing a very good job with all of this. NTA\n\nSidenote: always talk to your partner about children/their mother related issues. Not just because he's the father/ex-husband but because everything impacts him as bio-dad even if he doesn't know about it. If he knows from the beginning, he'll have the ability to get ahead of the situation; instead of playing catch-up.", "NTA. You done something that was wonderful and kind and you shouldn\u2019t apologize or be concerned. Their mum is just feeling insecure as it is something she isn\u2019t able to do for her own kids. And in regards to the legal threat, I can\u2019t imagine anyone frowning on someone for creating a wonderful and comfortable environment for children that live in their care.", "NTA - you did a wonderful thing for the kids; and their mom, instead of being happy for them getting cool room that are catered to their interests, decided to make it about herself and see it as a competition. Let your husband know about the call, for three important reasons. \n\n1. He needs to be prepared in case she does find a lawyer who will take this up.    \n2. He needs to be prepared for her to try and weaponize the children. Her maybe trying to make them feel guilty for loving their rooms. The kids might want to not make waves and internalize whatever she\u2019s telling them, so keeping an eye on them with knowledge is key.   \n3. He\u2019s your partner. You support him, and he supports you. Would you worry about him if he was upset and you didn\u2019t know why? Of course. A burden shared is lighter than one being carried alone. \n\n\nOn a side note, can you adopt me? I\u2019m 47, but I\u2019d really like a cool room too \ud83d\ude01", "No judge in the right mind is going to fall for that bullshit (unless the judge is homophobic). That's not parental alienation. NTA", "NTA \n\nI don't think the ex understands the definition of the word \"alienate\". I think she needs to add a dictionary to the interior of her home.", "Omg you\u2019re so NTA here. You\u2019re a hero.", "Deep down you have to know you're NTA. Sounds like mom knows she can't compete with what you're doing. I bet she's never been able to gift the kids anything as meaningful. That would have to hurt as a mother. But that's her problem. She should of cried in her car and moved on. Not call and chew you out.", "NTA and please can you visit me and recreate Ash's room? Sounds like you're doing an amazing job with your family.", "NTA. Your the step parent all kids deserve. She is projection on you.", "NTA. What is their mom going to say?  They are treating the kids better than I am! And I don't like it! They should be shittier parents than me so the kids will love me more! She'll be laughed out of court. You and your hubby/partner are just doing what good parents do.", "OP NTA. Her proper reaction should have been oh my God thank you for being so good to my children they love their rooms I appreciate the effort youre going to to make them feel  included in your family you're such an amazing step dad. Can I get some decorating tips and would you like to go out for mimosas.", "For REAL. That lawyer is going to tell her she needs her head examined.", "I wish we could get a transcript of the call to the lawyer. \n\nMom: OMG! You won\u2019t believe what ex\u2019s partner did to my children!!\n\nLawyer: oh, no, what\u2019s happened?!\n\nMom: He designed and built them amazing bedrooms that they love too much! \n\nLawyer: \u2026 \n\nMom: I want to take them to court! How dare he! \n\nLMAO \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA, obviously.", "Based on the title and the first few lines of the post. this was not what I'd expected. I expected that OP had designed the kids rooms to ~~her~~ his taste while they were away.\n\nThis was awesome!", "\u201cAfter 3 hours of billable research into the matter, I\u2019ve concluded you will need your head examined. That will be $975.\u201d", "OP is a guy.", "Ex wife is jealous of literally everything in this post. Info though- do you have any interest in adopting a 4th, 37 year old child?", "This. Lol", "I was wondering if at a age of 30+ it was too late to be adopted. I can cook, clean... I want me a cool library room too \ud83d\ude05", "You don't have to say bio mom when there is no adoptive or step mom at play. Op is male.", "NTA. but also i\u2019m highly skeptical on the trueness of this story due to the \u201cspiderweb window from wednesday\u201d aspect. the show has been out for less than 3 weeks and you already somehow had someone design, build and install it? absolutely not.", "NTA if this is true but this reads like a teenager\u2019s fantasy house.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You gave the kids an incredibly cool and fun place and also bonded with them in the process. \n\nYour boyfriend should be upset and he should be involved. As the step-parent you do not have to take any sort of bullshit from the kids\u2019 mother. If she starts ranting at you, you hand the phone to their father. You do not engage and do not take the abuse. That relationship is for your BF to navigate. \n\nPS you don\u2019t need to worry about her talking to her lawyer. Her lawyer will tell her she is nuts and there is nothing to do about you giving the kids custom rooms.", "NTA.\n\nI want to live with you. Where do I send the details for how I want my room?", "NTA. You're not alienating the kids from their mother. You're creating a safe, enjoyable space that they value. I cannot wrap my head around parents that hate when a step parent goes the extra mile for the kids. She'll be alienating the kids against herself if she continues this attitude. She's probably just jealous that she can't provide that for them.", "You are.NTA. She is out of line.\n\nIn an effort.to keep peace after TALKING to your SO (sorry, I missed if you were married) you might consider offering to decorate their rooms at her house (even if she is the AH)", "NTA - If you are the step parent, stop talking to the other parent.  Use the custody agreement to not have contact with her.  Easy peasey.", "You are a great stepmom. NTA.", "You did nothing wrong. NTA. \n\nDo you have a portfolio or do any online consulting? I'm going to start building our house in the spring which will be a small sort of modern cabin in the woods. (We're actually on a large acreage surrounded by trees. Let me know if you have a site).", "NTA. You not only gave generously of your skills, time and money - you made absolutely sure that each child was willing for the changes and gave maximum input on what they wanted. They\u2019re all extremely fortunate to have you in their lives. Mom is envious. Take the high road and ignore her.", "NTA. Don\u2019t allow other\u2019s insecurities stop you from being a decent human/parent to those kids. \n\nLet her take you to court or tell the lawyer. I was in your same position and I even doubled down. No one will ever make me insecure of a healthy relationship with my bonus sons.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are great, she is just jealous.", "NTA.... BUT.... will you adopt me...???", "NTA \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. No one will count this as parental alienation. You are an interior designer by trade and want to make the kids feel welcomed. That is 100% the right thing to do", "Yeah you are very much NTA. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion that you might be practically perfect in every single way. Keep up the good work!", "You are an awesome guy and clearly have taken the time to get to know the children she should be thankful you have put so much time, love and care into the renovations, she is probably just insecure with things at the min try not to take it to heart and enjoy your amazing relationship with the kids xox YOU ARE AMAZING btw NTA", "NTA you did nothing wrong but you need to talk with your husband, he needs to be aware of what she said so he can handle the situation and. Her!", "NTA and I\u2019m super jealous of Ash\u2019s room. This sounds so amazing.", "NTA, but can you be my stepdad too?", "NTA.  Funny how some people make everything about themselves.", "NTA. Please tell your partner about this conversation privately so the kids can't overhear. She was out of line", "NTA. You're making kid's dreams come true. Doesn't mean that they will love their Mother any less.", "Will you be my new dad? I love you. Lol", "NTA.  The mother is pushing her insecurities on you.  She's assuming your motivations are what hers might be.  You were just being nice and using your talents.  This isn't your fault.  It's her making a big fuss about something that's just a nice thing for her kids.  \n\nThose poor kids, if she can't enjoy their joys with them, instead of feeling threatened by it.", "NTA- but when you feel more calm you NEED to speak to your partner, it may not be an empty threat about getting lawyers involved and he needs to know if a shit storm is coming his way. You\u2019ve given those kids every kids dream of a room and should not be penalised for decorating.", "NTA. The ex is just jealous. You are not doing anything wrong or anything that would qualify as alienating the children from her. Her lawyer would probably laugh her out of their office if she goes in and says you're alienating them by giving them their dream rooms. Talk to your partner and fill him in on what she is saying.", "You are continuing to build a relationship with them.

Keep talking to them about mum as positive if possible, if not stay neutral.\n\nYou are NTA, you just wanted the kids have rooms that reflect them and you have a lot of skill, you trying to make this house, a home for them/you and they still have another home with mum which is equally important", "nta. youre the stepmother of my dreams \ud83e\udd79", "NTA, sounds great", "You have done such a beautiful thing for those kids. Stepchildren often worry so much that their parent's partner doesn't really accept them and is just behaving kindly toward them to keep the peace. Your work came out of a place of love and generosity, and it's great that you got them involved in the process at the outset so they could see how a vision board can become a concrete design. You and your partner should reach out to the mom and try to reassure her that you are not trying to compete with her.

Honestly kinda wish I had someone like you as a kid", "NTA\n\nSounds like their mom is upset that you have a good relationship with the kids.

Keep it up.", "NTA\n\nEx is dealing with her own stuff and this apparently set it off.  You did amazing with this to give them their own space and personality.

I'm not saying she would definitely win, I'm saying she may be able to drag it into court and make their life hell for a while.  She could add embellishments like claiming that the OP/dad is constantly explaining how much better they have it at her house and \"See I made you these great rooms\" etc etc.   It's insane, it's illogical to put children through it but with an unscrupulous enough lawyer who just wants to get paid there are plenty of ways a psycho can twist genuinely just trying to make everyone happy and comfortable in their home into \"They're trying to turn my kids against me\".", "NTA.
