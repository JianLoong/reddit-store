He has three kids \u2018Marco\u2019 (16M), \u2018Ash\u2019 (15NB) and \u2018Finn\u2019 (13M). I knew of his kids since before we started dating but I didn\u2019t meet them until about 7 months into dating and was introduced as their dad\u2019s boyfriend after 1 year, after about another year I moved in with them. And about 3 months ago we moved into our current house.\n\nWe are a close family but the three bed house we lived in before just wasn\u2019t big enough. I\u2019m also a professional interior designer .\n\nthe kids went to stay with their mother for a few weeks so I decided to start on their rooms, so while we were doing the rest of the house they had their own spaces. In our new house each kid gets their own room. Each room was customised to each kids likes and they had also each made a mood board of their dream rooms before. This along with \u2018IKEA dates\u2019 had become our thing. So I knew about their design preferences\n\nSo I did their rooms. Marco\u2019s room was alternate with a gothic focus. We recreated the spiderweb window from Wednesday and a wall covered in posters and magazine clipping from a bunch of bands he likes that i sources.\n\nAsh\u2019s room was very different, they also had a big window to allow sunlight for their plants, they had an entire wall that was a floor to ceiling bookcase with a library ladder. The bed was a reading nook in the upper corner of the bookshelf wall.\n\nFinn\u2019s was a fantasy and gaming themed room, themed around genshin impact, the design was subtle, this included an accent wall which was a mural of some of the landscape form the game aswell as other hidden details.\n\nEach room had a secret room in it aswell as that was something all of the kids wanted. Marco had a rotating platform like form classic scooby doo shows. Ash of course had a hidden door in the book shelf. And since Finn had the smaller room we sectioned off part of the attic, converted it and added a hatch into his room. We still tried to make it cool by having a button that caused a rope to be dropped down for him to climb.\n\nwhen the kids got back today to say they were ecstatic would be an understatement. They loved their rooms and exploring all the little details. We did go shopping for some extra bits they wanted (there were a few ideas i had that I waited for their opinions) and it was all fun, or so I thought. I just got a call from their mother and as soon as I answered she started yelling at me, saying that I was doing this specifically to target her and the kids so that they wouldn\u2019t want to stay with her and that I was alienating them, I bearly got a word in before she told me that she will be talking to her lawyer about this and hanging up on me.\n\nIn the moment I only wanted to do something special for the kids, but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve messed up and it making my anxiety go crazy. I\u2019ve kinda just locked myself in our room bc ik my partner would notice immediately that I\u2019m not ok and I don\u2019t want to burden him.

Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA!  You sound like a great step dad and your relationship with the kids sounds amazing!  Please talk to your partner about this.  Any issues with the children cannot be kept from their father even if it causes him stress.  He will side with you and stand up to their mother (she is very jealous and insecure btw.) \n\nI would also try your hardest to not speak I\u2019ll of her, especially around the kids.  You need to be the better person for the kids and show them how to be mature and to not alienate them from their mother.", "NTA.  I'm pretty sure decorating a kid's bedroom in the home of a parent with custodial rights isn't a violation of anything and, honestly, I'm a lil jealous of the library ladder.", "NTA. She feels threatened by you and insecure in her relationships with her children and is taking it out on you. Her relationships with her kids aren\u2019t your concern.

You don\u2019t need her permission or approval for what you do in your house. It was a nice gesture for the kids. It\u2019s not like you took them on holiday to another country so not sure why she is bothered.", "NTA, what you are doing is fucking amazing, regardless if the kids are bio or not. Their mom has no right to be mad at what you are doing for them, considering how much effort this all was. Keep it up!", "You did absolutely nothing wrong!

You did nothing wrong by putting your skills and talent to use on something those kids will love.  Mom is feeling insecure and threatened, but that's not on you, that's something she has to deal with inside herself.\n\nPlease do speak with your partner about this, though.  First of all, mom shouldn't be coming to *you* with any complaints, she should be going directly to your partner, as the person with whom she has a coparenting relationship.

She\u2019ll get laughed out of her lawyers office as they happily bill her for the appointment.

Teenagers are harder to please than little kids. You have connected with them and showed your love and care by decorating these rooms exactly how they\u2019d want.

It\u2019s pretty clear that mom isn\u2019t putting in the work and wants to blame you, rather than looking at why the kids aren\u2019t enjoying their time with her as much.", "NTA - you\u2019re the coolest stepmom ever. What you do with their space at your house isn\u2019t about her.\n\nETA I apologize for not reading closely. Coolest stepdad!", "NTA such a nice thing to do for the kids. Maybe talk to the mum in few days. She is insecure and scared of the boys not wanting to come back to her house, liking yours more, maybe her not being able to provide for them in various areas as much as you can. She needs to know that the communication is ongoing with you that she is included in some decisions making from your side. \n\nHowever, Saying that, it\u2019s only her problem. It doesn\u2019t have to concern you at all. It all depends on your personality if it will. And your partner. \n\nThis is also only my opinion, not any psych evaluation.", "NTA.

But as teens /nearly adults (the older two) if this alienates mum its her fault not yours", "NTA  - that's not alienation. Alienation would be telling the kids shes a petty AH and trying to turn them against her. Yep, they'll love their rooms more, and it sounds OTT a bit, but if you guys have the ability to do it, that's cool. I'd love to be able to give my kidbher dream room.\n\nShe's pissed off because she can't do the same. I get that too. But IMHO you are no AH. If she's a good mum she hasn't got anything to worry about.", "NTA.  Holy hell OP.  Can I be your stepchild too?\n\nWhat you did was amazing and soooooo generous.  The bio moms reaction was pathetic.  The correct response would be, \"Thank you for being so giving and kind to treat my children in such a special way!\"  Some people \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou just keep being you OP.", "NTA biomom is just jelly", "To be honest, I feel for both OP and the mother.

Sometimes one parent is jealous/threatened because they\u2019re not so well off, and it hurts when the kids get excited about things that take money.

She should have risen her issues with her ex before coming to you. Depending on how her relationship was with her ex and you before this you could offer to help her design or make the spaces at her house for the kids different and their own.

And, these kids will remember the care and effort you put forth for them for the rest of their life. That\u2019s far more important than mom\u2019s jealously.

If someone did that for my kids, I\u2019d be thanking them. I\u2019m guessing the mother isn\u2019t capable of doing such things, and it made her jealous and insecure. She lashed out and took her anger out on you. You didn\u2019t deserve that. Definitely don\u2019t keep this from your partner. He needs to know.

Yeah, but she would have to prove it.  But alienation is more along the lines of telling the kids lies, like their mom doesn't love them, or want them. Or that shes a bad person and/or is doing bad things, or is unwell or unsafe to be around, etc. At this point,  she's just making empty threats. I mean technically she could attempt to say they're trying to buy the kids' affections but the judge will be just ask OP and his partner for their side, and will rule in their favor anyway, as he or she will see it for what it is...an attempt to make their kids feel more welcome and comfortable when they come see their father.

Her pride (or ego) has taken a huge hit, and is still raw because her ex not only didn't want her, but is now with a man.
