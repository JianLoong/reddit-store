He has three kids \u2018Marco\u2019 (16M), \u2018Ash\u2019 (15NB) and \u2018Finn\u2019 (13M). I knew of his kids since before we started dating but I didn\u2019t meet them until about 7 months into dating and was introduced as their dad\u2019s boyfriend after 1 year, after about another year I moved in with them. And about 3 months ago we moved into our current house.\n\nWe are a close family but the three bed house we lived in before just wasn\u2019t big enough. I\u2019m also a professional interior designer .\n\nthe kids went to stay with their mother for a few weeks so I decided to start on their rooms, so while we were doing the rest of the house they had their own spaces. In our new house each kid gets their own room. Each room was customised to each kids likes and they had also each made a mood board of their dream rooms before. This along with \u2018IKEA dates\u2019 had become our thing. So I knew about their design preferences\n\nSo I did their rooms. Marco\u2019s room was alternate with a gothic focus. We recreated the spiderweb window from Wednesday and a wall covered in posters and magazine clipping from a bunch of bands he likes that i sources.\n\nAsh\u2019s room was very different, they also had a big window to allow sunlight for their plants, they had an entire wall that was a floor to ceiling bookcase with a library ladder. The bed was a reading nook in the upper corner of the bookshelf wall.\n\nFinn\u2019s was a fantasy and gaming themed room, themed around genshin impact, the design was subtle, this included an accent wall which was a mural of some of the landscape form the game aswell as other hidden details.\n\nEach room had a secret room in it aswell as that was something all of the kids wanted. Marco had a rotating platform like form classic scooby doo shows. Ash of course had a hidden door in the book shelf. And since Finn had the smaller room we sectioned off part of the attic, converted it and added a hatch into his room. We still tried to make it cool by having a button that caused a rope to be dropped down for him to climb.\n\nwhen the kids got back today to say they were ecstatic would be an understatement. They loved their rooms and exploring all the little details. We did go shopping for some extra bits they wanted (there were a few ideas i had that I waited for their opinions) and it was all fun, or so I thought. I just got a call from their mother and as soon as I answered she started yelling at me, saying that I was doing this specifically to target her and the kids so that they wouldn\u2019t want to stay with her and that I was alienating them, I bearly got a word in before she told me that she will be talking to her lawyer about this and hanging up on me.\n\nIn the moment I only wanted to do something special for the kids, but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve messed up and it making my anxiety go crazy. I\u2019ve kinda just locked myself in our room bc ik my partner would notice immediately that I\u2019m not ok and I don\u2019t want to burden him.

Yeah, but she would have to prove it.  But alienation is more along the lines of telling the kids lies, like their mom doesn't love them, or want them.

I mean technically she could attempt to say they're trying to buy the kids' affections but the judge will be just ask OP and his partner for their side, and will rule in their favor anyway, as he or she will see it for what it is...an attempt to make their kids feel more welcome and comfortable when they come see their father.

And I'm grateful that they're loved and housed and fed and clothed and taken to where they need to go, as well as on holidays and all the rest of what being part of a family means. I told the kids that hearts only grow, and that having more people who love them, and who they love, will never be a bad thing.\n\nMy kids know who I am.

I don\u2019t think it qualifies so morally - they split their time, you had a new house that had to be done up, and you did it to their liking. That reflects less alienation of the other parent and more ideal bonding of blended families. Plus, these kids are all old enough to not be so fickle that they can be bought with material things - teenagers are far more sensitive to the emotional atmosphere of their houses than to the availability of things. You did well.\n\nBut please talk to your partner - this is not OK and he needs to have a chat with his ex about this.", "NTA and btw can you drop by and give my room a makeover?", "It's her fault she feels inadequate. Maybe she should step up her parenting game. NTA. I would love to get a customized room.", "NTA, just give yourself a minute, don't turn on your boyfriend, he's your support and will be facing this with you. Wow, what an odd response from their mother. She should be happy that the kids all have rooms that they love. It's really not something to talk to a lawyer about.  Criminal decorating with intent to alienate?..... Weird.", "NTA", "NTA, but you HAVE to burden him.   the crazy exwife threatening with lawyers is his burden to deal, he is supposed to know about that.  he is the one who is supposed to deal with her, not you", "NTA NTA NTA", "NTA.

And if she does call a lawyer they will tell her that any judge will laugh their ass of if they bring that before them.", "The only possible scenario where I could see this being uncool is it you did all the renovation while their dad was also away and you didn't tell him. But you say you worked on the rooms together with your partner, so that obviously that's not what happened. \n\nSo NTA. But you do need to talk to Adam about this. The kids' Mom will get laughed out of any court if she tries to claim alienation because the kids' Dad and stepdad decorated their rooms, but ultimately he is the one that will have to deal with any blowback from his co-parent. Just be there to support him if he needs you. But this is not your fault, and I'm 100% sure Adam won't blame you for his ex-wife being ridiculous.", "NTA. You need to talk to your partner about this especially since bio mom is talking lawyers. You did nothing wrong. Bio mom should be happy her kids have special rooms and are made welcome in your home. She\u2019s obviously feeling jealous. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. She\u2019s the AH for making that call and speaking to you that way", "NTA, aka the mom does not like that you made the kids Happy because she doesn't like that you have a relationship with them.\n\nIt sounds like the larger issue is that you have anxiety that you are not currently equipped to manage, and you need to create a new toolbox. First thing in that toolbox, is closing the line of contact between your partner's ex and you. She is hostile toward you so all contact need to go between your partner and his ex, or if you absolutely must have a line of contact open between the two of you, over one of those parenting apps where everything you guys say is recorded so there's consequences to her actions.\n\nSecond thing on the list, is you need to actually communicate with your partner. That is his ex, these are his kids, it is wrong for you to keep secrets from him because it's \"burdening\", him.

He needs to be prepared for her to try and weaponize the children. Her maybe trying to make them feel guilty for loving their rooms.
