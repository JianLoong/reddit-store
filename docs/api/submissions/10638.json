To have some motivation, we decided to go with a little challenge and whoever failed to resist the urge to bite nails first had to pay $100. Later, another friend joined us and we jokingly called ourselves \"Anonymous Nailbiters\". \n\nSomehow, the word began to spread and now we have over 20 regulars, not only girls but guys too! I did not expect it to blow up like this, but honestly I am proud of our little community and of every wonderful member. The challenge thing is now voluntary, basically we're just a safe space for everyone to talk about everything in life, but of course a lot of talking revolves around nails: care tips, experience with different products, progress sharing, coping strategies to resist biting, etc. Think of it as a very welcoming and supportive little hobby club.\n\nSo, now to the problem. Last weekend, my friends and I were at the nail salon, I got a new very pretty design and I said to my friend that I couldn't wait to show it off at the club. There was another lady and she asked what club were we talking about. I started to explain but she interrupted me mid sentence and went like 'wow you really had to create an entire club for your lack of self control? This is a mockery, you're disrespecting people who are struggling with real issues, you should not put your petty first world problems on the same level as real problems'.\n\nI tried to apologize and explain myself but she scoffed and turned away. The rest of our appointment went in complete awkward silence.\n\nI just can't stop thinking about it. Did I hit something personal? I always thought our little club was harmless and helpful for people, was I wrong this whole time?", "created_utc": 1677069998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118xcml/aita_for_having_a_nail_biters_club/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your club isn\u2019t causing any harm and it is motivating then good for you. That lady can suck a lemon with her broken, well-bitten nails.", "People really need to break up with the idea that you are obligated to live your life around other people's hang ups and triggers.  Who gives a shit if you hit something personal?  She was eavesdropping on your conversation and butted in.  \n\nYou aren't obligated to live your life tiptoing around everything that might possibly trigger some sensitive delicate soul.  You have no way of predicting what is going to be someone's trigger and it seems like nowadays everyone is triggered by every damn thing.  \n\nNTA", "Wait till she finds out about Sam's Club, The Babysitter's Club, Chess Club, omg BOOK Clubs - oh the horror! One can have fun in life without it negating from \"real world problems\". She most certainly needs a club. NTA. Not even a question and I wish you could go back to ask her what kind of clubs would be acceptable to her and what she was doing about world hunger while in a nail salon.", "Can you imagine being that woman and having to go through life filled with so much hate for the world?  Wow\u2026.also you are NTA.", "You're absolutely NTA. This is definitely a \"her\" problem and nothing to do with you, don't worry.", "OMG, what was her problem. Oh, wait, nobody cares.\n\nOP, you have a nailbiters club. You have lots of members. Good for you, you have a support  system, and you have *nothing* to apologize for. NTA", "NTA\n\nTruly, the nail salon lady was reaching the longest reach to every try reaching. \n\nI, personally as a long-term and lifelong nail biter, think this is a very cute and actually fun way to not only stop yourself from worsening a bad habit but also a good way of keeping yourself accountable and fun way to rehabilitate yourself. \n\nAND even if nail biting does exist as an extremely debilitating issue for some people, there's nothing wrong YOU are doing by having a fun little club to get over your own habit. You aren't hurting anyone with a severe issue and it's not mocking anyone. In my eyes, this is similar to maybe study group consisting of people who all tend to be procrastinators so you use each other to keep yourself on track.\n\nKeep at it OP, don't let a random person deter you. That lady seems bitter.", "Nta- nail biting is a really hard habit to break and a lot of the time it comes from anxiety, having a club for this sounds absolutely awesome, kind of jealous not gonna lie!

The rest of our appointment went in complete awkward silence.\n\nDon't even apologize for this. This lady is not worth the time spent writing the post.\n\nHateful, bitter people only know hate and bitterness. It's how they experience everything.", "Definitely NTA, matter of fact you are the opposite of an ahole. You created something that is helping people. Good on you.\n\nAs for the cranky person. I would like to ask why she is spending money at a nail salon when she could send it to feed people in a third world country.", "NTA. Sounds like it's a good little club to help relieve anxiety by talking through stuff, a good support network. \n\nYou can have a club for anything you like. It's not hurting people. \n\nBet that woman has no friends! She sounds like a nasty piece of work.", "NTA.\n\nThe other lady's problem was -- oh, wait, I just realized  I don't care about her at all.", "NTA. Just because you aren't thinking about \"real\" issues 24/7 doesn't mean you're being disrespectful. Those are some top notch mental gymnastics. She sounds like a bitter asshole.\n\nAlso, is she familiar with all the other countless clubs that are not centered around serious world issues?", "The lady is just jealous because she's not invited to any clubs. \n\nYou are NTA in a million years. \n\nYour life, your friends and your club .. all consensual and your choices. Tell her to go back to being an adult and pay her taxes on time.", "NTA at all.  It\u2019s not your fault some people are only happy when they\u2019re miserable", "I\u2019ve literally have had a person  try to argue that the people who organize MADD are taking attention away from real bigger issues. Because drunk drinking (according to them) wasn\u2019t as big an issue as their XYZ passion project. All to say, there\u2019s critics everywhere. Good for you for forming community around a topic that most won\u2019t talk about. Keep doing you, there will always be grumps along the way.", "\"Did I hit something personal?\"\n\nNo, some people are just jerks that love to Yuck other people's Yums.  NTA by the way.\n\n\"you're disrespecting people who are struggling with real issues, \"\n\nYeah, no.  F that.  Any issue that is important enough for you to get 20 people on board with little effort to help with their problem isn't small.  Not every problem is Stage 4 Lymphoma, but that doesn't mean those problems should be ignored.", "NTA\n\nThe only person being disrespectful in this scenario is the woman.  She sounds like the sort of person no one would want in their club.\n\nYour club sounds great and you're right to be proud of it.", "NTA\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"real world problems\". It is just a bunch of people sharing an interest and gather around that interest. You have groups like this for all kinds of activities/interests.\n\nYou didn't need to apologize to the person in the nail salon. She was way out of line with her comments to you.", "NTA. Since she is nosy and rude to you. You should have said \"I did not ask your opinion\". This is the quickest way to make someone shut up.", "NTA. That woman was incredibly rude. Habits are incredibly hard to break, because their source is the basal ganglia, not the part where decisions are made.\n\nYour solution to stopping a habit that you found annoying in yourself was absolutely brilliant, and you have every reason to be proud of your creativity in coming up with such a great solution.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
