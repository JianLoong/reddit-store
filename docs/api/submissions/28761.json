His friend was fine at first but gradually he became the most annoying person I\u2019ve ever met, lemme explain. \n\nHe constantly interrupted everyone at the table, told stories that were completely unrelated to the stories being shared at the time, and everything that came out of his mouth was about him. Literally nobody else. No questions, no comments about what someone previously had said, just what he wants to say next about HIM. This man was 23 acting like a 10 year old.\n\nBy around what felt like the fifth time he interrupted me, he proceeded to cut my friend off when she was right in the middle of a story with some bullshit. I said \u201cexcuse me, my friend was talking.\u201d He said sorry. And fucking continued to interrupt us when we were talking.\n\nI was ready for this dinner to be over since he already ruined it, and his friend could tell we were done with his social incompetence. His friend said they had to go and we breathed a sigh of relief. As we were leaving, he tried to hug me and I dodged the hug. He said something along the lines of \u201cthis was really fun, I want to ask for your number\u201d , hitting on me, and I just said seriously? no. He said why not. I hesitated, looked at my friend, and told him the truth. That he was rude all night long, constantly interrupted us, and did not seem to understand any social cues. He seemed visibly upset and his friend shook my hand and they walked off. Every part of that man made me uncomfortable to my core, his behavior was just horrible. I wish you could\u2019ve seen his behavior to understand what I mean. I promise you I\u2019m not overreacting; usually people like this seem ignorable but he was speaking every five seconds.\n\nMy friend told me she understood why I said that but it was really bitchy of me and that I need to work on my reactions. I told her that I was so done by the end of the night with his audacity and blindness that I snapped. I feel pretty bad, but at the same time, our other roommates told us that I was being reasonable after I explained the situation. My friend said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t put effort into pleasing weird men or making them feel comfortable.\u201d I still feel shitty.\n\nUpdate, I blocked his snapchat account and he dmed me on instagram. I am so done with this creep.

This is a learning lesson for that guy. I have adhd and I have the HARDEST time NOT interrupting others. It\u2019s just takes a lot more effort on my part to wait my turn to speak. I know everyone is different and some have a harder time being social or reading social cues but it\u2019s not impossible. Just takes more effort for some of us. Also being told by someone to stop interrupting isn\u2019t a negative thing.

There is no reason for you to feel shitty about this.", "\u201cit was really bitchy of me and that I need to work on my reactions.\"\n\nNTA and your friend is way off base.   Do you want more Andrew Tate's in the world?  That's how you make more AT's.  Anyway, he demanded to know why you weren't interested, so you told him.\n\nDon't ask a question if you can't handle the answer.\n\nMy friend said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t put effort into pleasing weird men or making them feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nThis friend is correct!", "NTA. Maybe he\u2019s acted that way because no one has ever been brutally honest.", "NTA\nDoesn\u2019t sound like your the AH. If someone was being rude and cutting everyone off all dinner I would feel the same way. I think you \u201csnapped\u201d after he asked for your number, I hate when this happens and it\u2019s really awkward to say no but also you shouldn\u2019t have to give someone your number that makes you uncomfortable. Good for you it\u2019s probably the first time anyone corrected the guy or called him out on his behavior.", "NTA\n\nThat bahaviour is a massive pet peeve of mine.

But it\u2019s also not your fault, or your responsibility, and honestly you may have done him a huge favor by slapping him across the face with reality to say \u201chey buddy re-calibrate it\u2019s time to get your shit together\u201d. You\u2019re fine, and honestly you may have helped him.", "NTA\n\nAlways trust your gut.

He would never stop, no matter the subject, either he was an expert, or his buddy was an expert.

The friend who told you that you shouldn't put effort into pleasing men and making them feel uncomfortable is correct.

Good for you for calling him out and being honest.", "NTA - I feel like it\u2019s really hard to be the AH (or an unjustified AH) when telling the truth. \n\nIf you were honest about how abhorrent his behavior is, it might do him more good than harm in the long term. Hopefully he can take what you said and better himself and learn not to interrupt people and be more polite. Sometimes you just need a wake up call even though it might hurt in the moment. \n\nGood for you for not putting up with that and for shutting his request for your number down. Many woman would have just given it to him just to get him to go away.", "NTA\n\nEw. If your friend feels so bad for him, *she* can give him her number.  Oh, she doesn't want to do that?  Of course she doesn't.  And of course you don't.\n\nAaaaand now he's stalking you.  Of course.  You may need to bring this to the attention of your university.", "NTA. I have a horrible suspicion you have been in the presence of a thoroughly misguided acolyte to some online so-called \"pickup artist\". If this is the case, he (thought he) knew what he was doing and it was a deliberate (and insane) attempt to seek some kind of social dominance. And then the poor fool was thoroughly confused you didn't find his commanding presence incredibly sexy.", "If he's still hitting you up, you weren't rude ENOUGH. NTA.", "Your friend is wrong. You do not have to feign interest in people that you find unsavory. He may be on the spectrum and unable to process social cues, but he isn't deaf. You asked him to stopped interrupting your group and he did not. You told him you were not interested in him and he STILL continued to contact you repeatedly. He does not respect boundaries and that is the worst kind of person to \"be more polite to.\" They will take that as encouragement and suddenly, you're a bitch for leading him on. The fact that he went in for a hug shows he didn't hear anything you said to him. \n\nContinue to trust your gut when people creep you out. Your job in life is not to make yourself feel worse in order to make other people feel better.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I would have told him to shut the fuck up a few times by the sounds of it", "NTA \n\nYou asked him nicely. \n\nHe has selfish vibes. \n\nHe asked why you said no, which is very weird to me. You told him.", "NTA dude was an asshole. He deserve no consideration. You did well to shut him down hard. Your friend should give their number to that insufferable asshole.", "NTA. I think this was something he needed to hear. If he hears it often enough, from different people, it might start to sink in.", "NTA - Your friend in the last statement is correct. Hopefully, the guy will take your statement to heart and learn a lesson that he is not the only person who matters, and that listening is a skill he should work on. Imagine going on a date with him - you will not get a word in edgewise.", "that was not bitchy of you in any way, shape, or form. you set a clear boundary and, when asked, you explained yourself. he sucks. any friend that says you were wrong is an ah.\n\nNTA.", "Your friend is also weird bc wtf?? Good on you for saying SOMETHING bc he needed to be put in his place. Weird. NTA", "NTA and THANK YOU for being clear with him\nI get so frustrated when we're told to be polite and skirt around behaviour like this. This guy had zero self awareness and seems like nobody has ever told him this.", "NTA\n\nWhen I was 17, someone told me point blank about a behavior of mine that was socially inept. 40 years later, I'm still regularly thankful that they did so. Because of them I was able to grow into a better person, and I shudder to think of what my life would have been like had they not spoke up when I was still young enough to fix it before it became part of my adult reputation.\n\nYou did him a favor, and hopefully one day he will be thankful for it.", "Honestly he can\u2019t learn what he did is rude if nobody calls him out on it. It would have driven me crazy at some point as well too. \n\nAlso by the other comments you told him politely your friend was talking and to stop interrupting. All courtesy was already used up at that point. You didn\u2019t say it till he actually asked you why. NTA", "I feel you girl. I actually have a similiar problem sometimes and I actively work on it. When I get excited or am happy to talk about something I can interupt but over the years I have worked on it. If I end up doing it I am now very good at catching myself, stop speaking, apologize for cutting them off, and allow them to continue speaking. Ive noticed most people appreciate that gesture and understand especially if they are aware I have ADHD. \n\nNTA he needed a little kick in the ass to realize whats wrong with it and realize he won\u2019t be able to have comfortable social interactions till he realizes the sound of his voice isnt the only thing people wanna listek to", "NTA, he hasn\u2019t had enough of people like you in his life to point out his bad behavior to make him feel a need to change. People like your friend, who say just to let it go, are why he feels it is acceptable to be that way.", ">>but it was really bitchy of me and that I need to work on my reactions\n\nYour reactions are perfectly fine, you refuse to be in the company of strange and inappropriate-acting people. Might hurt their feelings, might save your life.\n\nNTA", "Anyway, let me tell you about the time I...\n\nKidding.  NTA. If you'd stood up to leave and just unloaded on him about everything, I'd say ah.  You said bye. He tried to HUG you [what?] and then asked for your number, you declined. The *moment* he kept pushing with \"why not\"   the gates are open. You said no--end of discussion. You don't have to validate or justify that. \n\nYou weren't rude or aggressive--you were honest.  Hopefully he's self aware enough to take what you said in, after the initial sting dies down. Hopefully, the fact that it stung, bc you're someone he liked, helps it hit home.\n\nIs he neurodivergent? Possibly. But we can't approach life just letting folks behave badly to us because they just might possibly potentially be. If something's present I need to be aware of [don't touch Billy with your left hand, it triggers him and he'll bite you] make me aware so I understand the interaction. \n\nYou feel bad bc you're not an ah.

Kind of a neurodivergent extension of weaponized incompetence. (Meanwhile many autistic gals are often either not diagnosed or expected to 'overcome' their autism, because autism is seen as more normal for boys, and there's a lot more stigma and pressure to hide it for girls.)\n\nBasically I would say there's a big difference between 'I miss social cues sometimes' and 'I don't have to respect social cues because I'm different' and unfortunately some autistic guys end up internalizing the latter. \n\nHopefully the dude in the post isn't one of them (if he is autistic/otherwise neurodivergent) and ends up learning from this how to treat people with more consideration.", "dude's smart enough to challenge her \"No\" when asking for her number though", "Woman on the spectrum here, and this sounds like just another a self entitled immature guy tbh", "I think it was a good way to help him, even if it takes a bit for him to swallow his pride and realize that she had a point.", ">it sounds to me like he might have a developmental or social disorder.\n\nPlease stop equating being rude with having a \"developmental or social disorder\".
