I have a stepson (4) that I adore and treat as my own.\n\n\nMy older brother's wedding is soon. I was intending on going but after I found out that my stepson was not invited, we started having issues. My brother explained that it's the nature of the wedding they chose which is child free but my fiancee was upset that this rule was forced on family as well. She got into arguments with my brother and his fiancee and ended up deciding to not go to the wedding. As a result I called my brother and told I no longer want to come after what happened. He began arguing saying my fiancee is the one being unreasonable and now has \"convinced\" me to miss his wedding. I told him that this is just me supporting my family after the way he and his fiancee treated them. His fiancee said they don't owe us anything and that this is a wedding rule that applied to everyone. I said \"fine then I'm not coming\". My brother is pissed my parents are calling me unreasonable for being willing to miss my only sibling's wedding and basically let a woman I've only known for a year an half drive a wedge between us. They said if I go through with this then I might lose my brother, who's my support and comfort forever, and so much damage and hurt will come out of this.\n\n\nI stopped responding to them but members of extended family are saying that me and my fiancee are creating the problem trying to control my brother's wedding.", "created_utc": 1669397938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4j7te/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 5023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was intending on going but after I found out that my stepson was not invited, we stsrted having issues. My brother explained that the nature of the wedding they chose which is child free but fiancee was upset that this rule was forced on family as well. She got into arguments with my brother and his fiancee and ended up deciding to not go to the wedding. As a result I called my brother and told I no longer want to come after what happened. He began arguing saying my fiancee is the one being unreasonable and now has \"convinced\" me to miss his wedding. I told him that this is just me supporting my family after the way he and his fiancee treated them. His fiancee said they don't owe us anything and that this is a wedding rule that applied to everyone. I said \"fine then I'm not coming\". My brother is pissed my parents are calling me unreasonable for being willing to miss my only sibling's wedding and basically let a woman I've only known for a year an half drive a wedge between us. They said if I go through with this then I might lose my brother, who's my support and comfort forever, and so much damage and hurt will come out of this.\n\n\nI stopped responding to them but members of extended family are saying that me and my fiancee are creating the problem trying to control my brother's wedding.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not as if your brother is only excluding your step son and that could be a hill to die on, but instead your fianc\u00e9 is literally throwing a fit because she wants special treatment. Why is it a big deal to hire a babysitter for the night? I myself have a 4 year old and taking him to a wedding sounds awful. I love my son sooo much, but he has 1000 questions about everything. Answering 1000 questions during a ceremony is not okay. Having a toddler running around at a formal dinner while servers are serving food and people are dancing and there are photographers with expensive equipment is also not okay.

It's unfair for your fianc\u00e9e  to argue with a couple who have chosen not to have children at their wedding. This decision had nothing to do with her, or her son, or even you.

I also love my baby who\u2019s not a baby anymore, but I also still love my brother.\n\nOP is solidly YTA. So is his fianc\u00e9e. The couple aren\u2019t wrong.", "I agree with everything you said except this... \n\n>Since I cannot believe you found your fianc\u00e9\u2019s gaslighting (trying to pretend children of family should all be entitled to attend regardless of the rules)\n\nThat's not gaslighting. Gaslighting would be if her fiance snuck into the brother's house and hid his things or cooked full meals and left them there to convince the brother that he was actuality forgetting doing those things or that he was downright mentally ill, and then explaining that only a mentally ill man would exclude family children from a child-free wedding.\n\nIt's not gaslighting to try and convince someone they are wrong, even if you're lying. It's gaslighting to make thrm question their own perception of reality to do so.", "That\u2019s not gaslighting. That\u2019s manipulation.", "I hate when people do this! Not everything is about you! And if you\u2019re concerned your family feels a way about your step - then pulling shit like this will only make that gap wider IMO.", "I get the feeling this absolute Angel of a stepson would be allowed to ruin the wedding or reception.  You see how well mom takes \u201cno\u201d for an answer.", "I was wondering about the Rihanna thing too. I thought maybe she misbehaves at weddings lol", "Seriously. Kids aren't going to enjoy a wedding that isn't in some way catering to the presence of kids. It's just not a kid friendly event. Hell, it's not even an adult friendly event in many cases it's just a boring social obligation you put up with because you love someone.", "Ugh, that is absolutely miserable. That's awful that your friend's wedding couldn't be about their marriage. You probably weren't the only one sick of that shit already.\nAnd you know why a lot of people opt for child free weddings? Because they *know* which family/friends will let their kids run wild.\n\nThe RSVP card for my friend's wedding included the statement: \"The reception is adults only. Childcare will not be provided\".\n\nHer ceremony was beautiful up until the reception. She ended up being guilted by extended family and had to include the children of her cousins. These kids were between 4 and 7 and nearly took out servers with trays of meals. What were the parents doing? Getting trashed.", "As a wedding present to my SIL, I have been learning balloon twisting. Even little kids seem to have the patience to stand in line for an hour to get a balloon sword or dog. Hopefully I can keep most of the kids entertained during the reception.", "This is a pretty messed up mindset. That\u2019s not the point here.", "Marriage isnt the be all end all of being someones parent, it depends on how long hes known them/how big a role he plays in the kids life. \n\n(The stepson thing i mean, not the wedding)", "This is honestly just splitting hairs. It's beyond the point. He's basically a stepson and saying \"well actually\" adds nothing to this convo", "Thank you. Like most buzzword of the week people often use that word incorrectly which is very annoying to me. Like every situation is not an example gaslighting.", "You mistyped \"this and\". No harm done: we know what you meant.", "My husband and I have some friends who met LARPing (live action roleplay play - basically like Dungeons and Dragons except you act it out with foam weapons as beat your friends up in the woods) and they had a viking and Celtic themed costume wedding. It was awesome. Whole roast pig and everything.\n\nEvery other wedding I've been to has been at best kinda dull.", "I also remember stepping on a bee at about that age, i think the itching afterwards was the worst part", "Except maybe he might\u2019ve been asked to be a ringbearer", "Dude NO kids were allowed to go, family included.", "Exactly. I had a friend (30 m) who was dating someone who I thought was emotionally abusive so I told him. It didn't go over well but we are still friends and something else happened down the road that had him call it off.\n\nHe never spoke of it and I don't know if my words clued him in but it's worth it to try to tell those we love, man or woman, if we think they're being abused.", "That's exactly why there's Child free weddings. For sure her son is one of the brats that's mess with everything...", "That's not the right hill to bear here.\n\nFTFY", "I always knew I messed up idioms but I am almost impressed I didn\u2019t notice this one was mixed.", "Oh, I love a good mixed metaphor! What a gem!", "My favourite will always be: you opened this can of worms... NOW LIE IN IT"]}
