You and hubby have nothing to apologize for or be the bigger people.   They're the ones that caused this and they need to be the \"bigger people\" and apologize to you!", "NTA.  You did not create this situation and are under no obligation to apologize.   Family or not, you and your husband should never tolerate this type of behavior.  Perhaps they will mature one day and realize they created this mess and then there may be a relationship to salvage.", "NTA - When they are ready to stop being AHs and ridiculous, they'll contact you guys. Otherwise, mazel tov on the wedding, hope you have a great life.", "NTA  I think.\n\nBut I do have to say, it sounds like an awful lot was glossed over. You don't say there's any sort of history of the brother being an asshole or doing anything. It feels so absurdly abrupt given what you've said for them to have basically gone no contact with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is when things started to weirdly turn. At family gatherings, we would start to hear comments directed at me, **his twin brother would say \u201cfamily FIRST always\u201d and \u201ccome on FAMILY let\u2019s sit together outside\u201d knowing very well we were the only ones not married/engaged yet.**This was just the beginning to a whole chain of events, beginning with being shunned by my husbands siblings **for sticking up for myself, calling them out for these rude comments**, and even being uninvited to their wedding,\n\nSo the NTA depends on:\n\n1. You actually being correct that these were intended as exclusionary. (Which is odd, because an engagement does not make you an in-law. If BIL meant them as exclusionary, he's a dunce because they'd apply equally to his fiance. That or he was using it loosely to refer to all present, seeing as you'd already been dating for 4 years).\n2. \"sticking up for myself\" and \"calling them out\" were *not* wildly out of proportion blow-up type responses.\n\nThe whole thing strikes me as bizzare. Why would husband's brother - who you had no problems with for four years - suddenly decide to target you once he got engaged? Some insane sibling competitiveness or something?\n\nI do have to wonder about whether those comments really were aimed at you because if they weren't and you ended up saying some harsh things to them, it'd look to them like \"*wtf, what's wrong with your brother's longtime girlfriend? We get engaged and then she's on our case? We can't have this at our wedding.*\" And then mutual aggrievement built from there.", "I'd minimize contact. Not make a big deal of it, just steer clear of them and their nonsense.", "NTA, forgive and forget only works if they don't continue the behavior that you were trying to forget.", "Info: after 4 years with your partner, even without a ring did you not feel a part of the family?\n\nBecause after 4 years I would consider my siblings partner a member of the family whether they were dating/engaged/married or any other type of coupling, so I guess I am reading the comments differently. To me it sounds like you intentionally excluded yourself/took offence when there was none and then it all spiralled.", "INFO: How have they treated you the past two years?", "I don't think this post can really be judged because I don't think you come across as a reliable narrator here.\n\nThe way you write, you seemed to dislike your BIL from the start for not letting you know about his online relationship super early and both your BIL and SIL for getting engaged quickly, even before any sort of comments. They may have been making jokes about how you weren't engaged yet, but they might have been made lightly or you might have just been hyper-sensitive to any mention of family because you treated the SIL as an intruder. Either way, you yadda-yadda'd somehow getting kicked out from a wedding while your husband, boyfriend at the time, was still the best man, and are upset that he was still invited, but I'd *expect* him to still be invited unless he was strongly defending your side of the fight (was he?).\n\nThen yeah, them calling to go to the wedding last minute just for the ceremony is a bit odd, but your claim that they never even looked at you at your own wedding is absurd, and suggests you are either willing to make up details to make your story seem better or you spent the entirety of your wedding staring at them instead of, y'know, getting married.\n\nIf you don't like them and don't want to see them, then by all means go no contact, but regarding an asshole judgment that's not really something I can make because the assumptions I'd have to make would be very negative.\n\nE: Rereading it, the elopement thing is also odd. Like yeah, if you just eloped it'd be strange for the brother to react badly or think you're doing it to beat him to the altar... but you come across as extremely upset that they got engaged quickly, were planning to marry first, and laser-focused on them during your own wedding, so it's hard not to assume that you were spurred into marriage totally independent of the BIL and SIL.", "Info: How long before their Wedding did you have yours?

He always had to feel like the \u201csuperior\u201d twin, whether it be having the better job, getting married first or having the bigger house. So we felt like his comments we\u2019re directed at both of us, to show his brother that he was in fact first and somehow i wasn\u2019t good enough for my husband to propose after only a few months (we met when i was 18 and my husband was 21, we never wanted to get married so young anyways) my husband and I are professional models together and she straight up told us the reason she didn\u2019t want me at the wedding was because she was scared i\u2019d cause a scene or try to upstage her, which i have never once attempted to do, it was her insecurities getting in the way. Everyone in the family and their friends too told them, they would regret this decision now having us at the wedding, but they still went through with it and we were not going to fight to be somewhere we were not welcomed", "that was the funny thing, I never once had problems with ANY of his family members until he met her, it\u2019s literally like a flip switched and he was desperate to prove he was doing better than his twin brother, his last relationship ended in him being cheated on and her getting pregnant by someone else while they were together, and at this time we were all living together with no issues. Then he met this new girl and immediately got engaged, which wasn\u2019t the issue, but he started essentially making fun of my husband for being \u201cbehind\u201d schedule and not having his life together as much as he suddenly did", "We say \u201chi\u201d and \u201cbye\u201d at family functions and that\u2019s about it for our interactions.

The only reason we knew they didn\u2019t interact with anyone at out wedding was due to all the comments we received afterwards asking essentially what was wrong with them, we barely kissed after the \u201ci do\u2019s\u201d and their seats were already empty so that\u2019s what threw us off because they were just there a minute ago. We actually lived with his brother and his then girlfriend and all got along extremely well, until she cheated on him and got pregnant by someone else, so she moved out and he met his fianc\u00e9 a few weeks later, we were super concerned with this timeline and felt he never really gave himself time to heal, but everyone is different in their timeline of moving on i suppose", "We got married 3 months before their wedding, over a year of them being engaged, and at this point my husband and I were together for 5 years and already lived with each other and have a dog together", "We\u2019re \u201ccivil\u201d now in terms of saying \u201chello\u201d and \u201cgoodbye\u201d but that\u2019s about it. Whenever we\u2019re all together, they make it a point to intentionally not sit by us or start any conversation, and the only time his brother does talk to him, it\u2019s to essentially brag about something going good in his life. My husband has such a huge heart though he tries to always see the good in every situation, i\u2019m just so tired of him feeling weighted down every time they interact with each other.", "Damn, he really is that competitive, huh... Ridiculous behavior on his part. \n\nWell, I dunno. I'd probably want to try talking to them, even if the only point ends up being to confirm that no-contact is the way it's going to stay and/or that it is justified.\n\n(Though if it was me, I wouldn't be saying anything about forgiveness until he/they recognize the problems with their behavior. I mean..what's the good of forgiving, forgetting, and resuming contact only for them to keep right on behaving in the same way? They can't compete on who is married and who isn't now, so who knows what the next contest will be)", "That doesn't answer my question.\n\nAs I said in my post, after 4 years I would consider my siblings partner as family, so with or without a ring if I talked about family it includes the partner.\n\nWhat I read here is that he has made comments about family that YOU have taken offence to and felt excluded by because you don't have a ring. Maybe you took offence because you dislike the brother so were looking for a reason to be offended, or maybe you genuinely didn't feel like family so felt like his comments did exclude you.\n\nThe way you describe the brother and the situation comes across as unreliable because it seems like you don't like him and are trying to blame everything on him even though it comes across as starting with you.", "&#x200B;\n\nIt seems simple to me:\n\nEither they treat you well and are a good part of your life, so keep being around them.\n\nOr they treat you badly and make your life worse, so cut them off.\n\nWhich is it? No need to relitigate events from 2 years ago to justify your choices, just be clear about your feelings like an adult.", "Ok Info: how did the elopement turn into a wedding? Was it still like a court house thing or did it turn into a full wedding?", "that\u2019s the thing, It seems the next contest in their mind is who get\u2019s pregnant first.. which they did end up getting pregnant of November last year but it sadly ended in miscarriage unfortunately. Also the only reason we found this out was from their mom accidentally mentioning it to us, they never told us directly. However, i now find myself 8 weeks pregnant and truly terrified to tell them out of fear of the past and them thinking we did this on purpose (it was a VERY unplanned pregnancy, but we are still so happy about it)", "actually got along with his brother super well, we were very young when we started dating (18 & 21) so didn\u2019t expect to be family right from the start as we\u2019re all still figuring it out, but his wife is very Christian and would look down on us for already living together not being married, and it seemed that his brother just hopped on the bandwagon that she began of criticizing our life choices and saying he\u2019s doing it the \u201cright\u201d way (dating, engaged, marriage, then living together) vs. us doing it the \u201cwrong\u201d way i suppose", "I recently found out i\u2019m pregnant and don\u2019t think I want them to know or ever be involved in our child\u2019s lives considering our past with them, and don\u2019t know how to move forward with announcing to other family members", "It was considered a micro wedding, less than 30 guests, all only close friends and family. Which was still bigger than we wanted, but we both have very large immediate families so it added up pretty quickly", "how do his parents feel about it?", "Ah, so that's what it is. Yeah, I mean, they seem like they've been treating you like shit for years. I personally would not tolerate that in my life.\n\nDoes hubby agree and support you? You need to be 100% sure and united in this.\n\nIf he does, it's as simple as announcing it once and enforcing it permanently. There's nothing to do really - you don't need to convince them or argue with them, just tell them you're fed up with being disrespected and excluded and you don't want them around your family, and not to communicate you until further notice. And then simply block + never respond. Done and done. But you gotta be sure + strong.", "Ah ok \n\nI think last question/s\n\nInfo: How has the rest of the family been after all this? Is it just the twin and his wife? \n\nI\u2019m trying to read the comments but it\u2019s being weird for me.", "my husbands mom is a very non confrontational person, his whole family is for that matter, and bless her heart she just wants all her children to get along so she tries to get us together for family functions but it just never works out the way she wants, someone always ends up getting singled out and she tries to pretend it\u2019s not happening, so we just put on a face and pretend things are fine around her when in reality they\u2019re just not", "It\u2019s just them we do not have contact with, we get along perfectly well with his other siblings/family members!", "So I think the argument could be made for ESH: you only lightly so just because to me it feels kinda bad and crappy to throw a wedding before theirs even if it was a small one. \n\nThey are bigger ones just from the bit I\u2019ve gathered from the other comments and answers I\u2019ve seen. So I feel your NTA for not wanting to reach out and \u201cbe the bigger person,\u201d if they/him haven\u2019t also reached out to offer apologies. You and your husband have a right to keep them out if you guys want."]}
