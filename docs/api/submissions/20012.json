Tell her, your actions on Father\u2019s Day disappoint me dearly. So sad. So sad; expect the same behavior next Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nThen let her stew in her juices.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to communicate this. She can't read minds.", "NTA - you are entitled to your feelings.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately that is the reality of Father's Day. Most people consider it a low priority holiday, even though they'll turn around and say you are an AH if you did the same during Mother's Day.", "It makes you feel like fathers don't matter huh? It sucks.\n\nNTA", "Oh honey.  I\u2019m sorry that this happened.  And if this is typical then even talking to her about it may not help.  I\u2019ve had my spouse skip even acknowledging anniversaries, important events and my 40th birthday.  \n\nI wish I had an answer for you.  I\u2019m considering ending my marriage (that is one of the reasons: his inability to think of me)", "[deleted]", "YTA - I mean this in the nicest possible way but Father\u2019s Day is about you as a parent, not a husband. I know your child is too young and she needs to do his shopping, but it sounds like you\u2019re putting quite a bit of pressure on her. I won\u2019t make assumptions about the division of household labour and the \u2018mental load\u2019 in your relationship, but I would encourage you to reflect if it is equal. Father\u2019s Day is not purely about you being pampered. You got to spend precious time with your child and if you had a nice time with him, that\u2019s a win. If the day means a lot to you, you could have suggested something you could do today as a family or made plans for you and your son. It doesn\u2019t all need to be on her.", "NTA. However, you need to stop stewing in your own juices and communicate with your wife how disappointed you are in her lack of effort in appreciating you on Father\u2019s Day, Let her know that money is not the issue but she should have/ could have at least made you dinner. Stop doing all of the extras you do for her until she reciprocates. By accepting the meager efforts she throws out you are teaching her that that\u2019s all you are worth. You deserve better OP but your wife isn\u2019t a mind reader and you need to communicate better before resentment builds. Good luck!", "You\u2019re not TA, your feelings of being neglected are valid, however, you are an adult, and the solution to these feelings is NOT to be upset that your partner wasn\u2019t psychic, it\u2019s to use your big boy words and tell your partner calmly exactly what you want so they can follow through.", "NTA, having emotions such as disappointment it frustration will never make you an AH. It's how you act on those emotions. Like potters have said, you should talk with your wife, have an open conversation.", "NTA. I'm questioning her overall health, though, specifically if she may be pregnant. Pregnancy can make some women want to sleep all day long, and each pregnancy is different. So if her first pregnancy went well overall, that's not a guarantee that any subsequent pregnancies will go well too. Also, getting you  a few things you liked and a few things you didn't like could be at least partly because she found some of the things she knew you'd like rather unappetizing so she avoided them. Just a thought. I do agree with others that you need to communicate your needs and wants better.", "NTA, we don't really do anything for my partner because it's not his vibe, the kids give cards and presents and spend time with him. We're on holiday this year but I made sure to bring the kids gifts with us. I'm the same and am not really bothered about Mother's Day, maybe I will be when the kids are more aware of it and actively want to celebrate it with me. They're only 1&3 so only my 3yo is aware and he loves it because we usually bake and spend time together as a family because that's all I need/want on Mother's Day. If you want more, you have to tell her. \n\nIt sounds like she went for a nap to give you 1-1 time with your son, if you wanted family time maybe say that to her? Ask if next year you can go out for the day as a family because whilst you appreciate her efforts it didn't quite live up to your expectations of what Father's Day should be. You don't need to have an argument or cause a drama about something when what it's really about is celebrating your role within your family.", "I really didn\u2019t need all out. But she expects a certain treatment on Mother\u2019s Day and I\u2019m happy to oblige. So no paying for her own meal and presents I know she wants. For Father\u2019s Day it all felt a bit low effort and with her disappearing for a couple of hours for a nap I felt undervalued. Plus she was in a stinker of a mood most of the day. Guess I\u2019m just feeling a bit shit.", "[deleted]", "No, not mind reading. And I don\u2019t think I made Mother\u2019s Day a particularly big thing either. Presents I know she\u2019d like and not having to pay for her own meal are pretty basic for Mother\u2019s Day I\u2019d have thought? Similar treatment would\u2019ve been nice. After 10 years her presents just felt like she hadn\u2019t paid attention to anything I like.", "I wondered whether to post the set up as I thought this might come up. But basically I work from home almost all of the time and she works from home twice a week. I do almost all of the school runs, breakfast, pickups etc. I also take him to footy practice every week and my mum\u2019s at a weekend for a few hours while she stays home or joins us if she wants to. I spend plenty time with him and I have done again today. I was playing footy with him for 2 hours this morning for example and I\u2019ve been with him for the rest of the day until bedtime - this is entirely normal for a weekend. In other words, I probably see him more and I do more around the house than she does, washing, cooking etc. So a little bit of thought would\u2019ve gone a long way. I think I\u2019m just a bit down about things and I know it\u2019s my day with my son that matters. I guess it\u2019s just left me feeling a bit undervalued by my partner and I\u2019ll chat with her about it.", "My big boy words are saying you\u2019re being patronising. Psychic ability wasn\u2019t a requirement. Making a small mental note of things that are very apparent likes/dislikes in a long term relationship are a bare minimum to my mind. Choosing two beers that I\u2019ve never liked and have previously explained I really don\u2019t like was a bit shit - couple that with going to bed half way through the day and being miserable around me and our son and the result is a bit of a shit day for me.", "So, is the wife an A H?", "She isn\u2019t pregnant and our son is a few years old. She\u2019s 41, doesn\u2019t really drink, doesn\u2019t smoke at all and goes running a couple of times a week. She\u2019s also slim and in good health. But I\u2019ll take the blame for her buying crap presents that she knows I don\u2019t like. Great.", "It sounds like she went for a nap to give him 1-1 time? Yeah right smh...", "In that case, if she has that expectation for mothers day, you're not at all wrong for expecting it for Father's Day!!", "Tell her. Don\u2019t just tell us. Tell her how you feel.  If she gets upset, get your child and leave for the night.", "I would've committed suicide due to my mother's abuse if it weren't for my dad actually giving a shit about my mental health and getting me help. I'm not about to celebrate my mother for anything, let alone going and getting herself knocked up with a kid she emotionally tortured for 16 years. Dads are just as important, if not more so, than mothers, and deserve to be celebrated too.", "BS. The role and effort of the father is as important as that of the mother.", "Absolutely not.  My husband who had my step son and my father get celebrated.  My my my aren\u2019t you a toxic person.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\nWhat a lovely and involved father you are! Not to mention  domestic partner! I'm sorry you had a crap day. In the nicest possible, I'd suggest speaking with your wife. She sounds like maybe she is going through something, thinking about something or distracted. Find out what. In the nicest possible way. When you figure out what the issue is and have ways to solve it, gently explain why her distraction with the thought behind your gift was hurtful. Just, you know, read the room and all. Best of luck!", "Yes you should definitely chat to her about how you feel! Wishing you all the best", "I\u2019m sorry that you feel that way, that was not my intention.", "I never said you were to blame, because you're not. I think both of you should communicate better because communication is one of the most important aspects of a healthy relationship. All couples should communicate.", "I know. She must\u2019ve been worn out from all that effort she made.", "I will have a chat with her but I don\u2019t think leaving with our son would be particularly helpful or healthy.", "OK, say for instance you\u2019ve been with your partner for 10 years. Every year on your birthdays or at Christmas, you get each other things that you know the other one will like and this has worked for years. No expectation of high value items, just stuff we know the other person likes. I\u2019ve carried this on into Mother\u2019s Day but she\u2019s not for Father\u2019s Day. Plus she was in a mood and buggered off to bed for a nap half way through the day. There have been no discussions about expectations but previous behaviours and events have always had the same sort of results. As in one person gets a few treats and some time to relax and the other one takes a bit of extra effort for the occasion. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I was expecting. I really don\u2019t think it should be more explicit than this.", "You said use \u201cbig boy words\u201d - how much more patronising could that be?", "Sorry for being sarcastic. I\u2019m feeling a bit hurt and touchy about it.", "I get that you feel I was being patronizing, like I said though, that was not my intention and I\u2019m sorry that you feel that way."]}
