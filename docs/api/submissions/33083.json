Maybe they\u2019re talking with relatives to get some backing, or secure a loan. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Just ask first. All about that communication.", "I'm assuming you're sharing information on available houses at least in part because you know the other is looking.

Which means somebody *else*, somebody not your house hunting friend, will end up buying it.\n\nIf it were *me*, I would be happy for you. Maybe a little envious, too, that you had a bigger budget and could make the deal. But overall I would be glad you found what you wanted. \n\nBut then, I am an actual adult.

Don't make it weird.", "If they are not going to make an offer either way, you should definitely do it. NTA", "NTA - the housing market is super competitive and there is a strong likelihood that neither of you may end up getting the house anyway. Just be open and transparent with your friend, maybe offer to help them keep looking in the neighborhood. I mean how cool would it be to live next to your friends?", "NTA.  The house won't be available forever and the other couple isn't even making an offer.  Don't see a conflict here.", "NAH\n\nBut you should talk to her about it. If its not within their budget, she'll likely just be happy for you.", "NAH. But I do recommend taking to them before you do it. You will know if they would think you would be an A Hole or not.  Then you can come post an update asking who is the A Hole if your friends told you not to buy a house that they like too. Haha", "NAH\n\nTell them that you think they have amazing taste, and are grateful that they showed you that one because you missed it and that you are going to try for it. A decent friend might feel some envy, but mature grown-ups are able to process that.

They may be working on something behind the scenes that you are unaware of that could put them back in the running. You don\u2019t want to end up bidding against each other. If your friend says they\u2019re not quite done yet, back out gracefully understanding you both might lose out.

Explain that it\u2019s everything you\u2019re looking for and maybe throw her something as a \u201cthank you\u201d for referring. Bottom line: you can afford it, she can\u2019t and her inability to afford it is not your problem. Why should neither of you get it. NTA.", "NTA - in your budget, not in theirs.

A real friend would be, in my opinion.", "If you get the house, consider the friendship over. It's pretty simple.", "\u201cHi X are you putting in an offer for house Z??

I don't understand why people go out of their way to NOT communicate. After the friend responds, OP can decide between damaging their friendship or owning a home.", "I agree with this. You just have to ask if it's okay with them.", "This is the way", "This!", "Agree with this!", "Then we all respond saying NTA and friend doesn\u2019t get to claim all houses in this market they simply find first but don\u2019t want OP to get since they couldn\u2019t.", "I would not \"ask\" for permission.\n\nI get it, it's a weird feeling, just communicate that you are interested and will most likely make an offer.\n\nThank them for sharing the listing with yiu", "This! Can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so far. Definitely don\u2019t ask, that just makes it weird (and sets you up for them to say no, like Cheesyoperator pointed out). Doing it without acknowledging your friend sent the listing in the first place would make it weird. Saying you wanted to check, or no hard feelings, or mentioning the budget\u2026 would be a downer. And make it weird. \n\nBe positive and grateful! Thank her for bringing this house to your attention and let her know you guys are putting an offer on it! Yay! Exciting! \n\nEveryone is assuming friend might be upset by the fact you guys might get it\u2026 why not assume your friends would be happy for you and that\u2019s why they shared the listing in the first place!

I only mention that because OP said her friend mentioned \u201cabove their budget\u201d. If they started talking about the income gap first, then I believe it\u2019s okay. If they haven\u2019t and it\u2019s kind of understood, then yeah. No money talk.", "If she didnt know about it before the friend told her it\u2019s a huge dick move to steal the listing.", "In fairness to your last part about people assuming friend would be upset, this is Reddit and we live in a world of \u201cI want it and if I can\u2019t have it, you shouldn\u2019t either!\u201d Also \u201cmain character\u201d people who think in a \u201cyou knew I couldn\u2019t afford it and bought it just to rub it in my face\u201d way. Sometimes things like weddings, homes, cars, etc bring these feelings and behavior out of otherwise rational people.\n\nEdit: to OP- if you really think this would ruin your friendship, I\u2019d be questioning the friendship because if it\u2019s not a friendship it\u2019ll be something else that they can\u2019t afford and you can. \u201cOh we wanted to go to (insert very popular vacation spot) but can\u2019t afford it but you went just to rub it in our faces\u201d.", "It's not stealing, their friends can't afford it", "people often buy houses that aren't in their price range and it's not uncommon for a mid range house to go down by even 150k during negotiations", "I understand that.
