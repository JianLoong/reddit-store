Not a lot of people, a couple of his friends and family members and 2 of my friends. Everyone left around 10:30pm and at that point my boyfriend had decided to go to bed. I wasn\u2019t tired and wanted to celebrate more so I told him I was going over to my 2 friends house (the 2 that were at my celebration) for a few hours and I\u2019d be back later. He seemed annoyed but I left anyway. I came back a few hours later and he was SO pissed that I was gone saying I know he doesn\u2019t like to sleep alone and how dare I not care about his feelings (I do care, but I should be allowed to go see my friends) and go see my friends making him fall asleep alone. He then proceeded to tell me since he had to spend 3 hours alone in bed with no cuddles I had to sleep on my side of the bed and he\u2019d cuddle me in 3 hours just so I know what he had to go through. He said it wasn\u2019t about me seeing my friends, just the fact that he had to sleep alone for a few hours and it\u2019s not fair to him. I even tried to cuddle him and he pushed me off and said don\u2019t cuddle me , so I moved to my edge of the bed and fell asleep. He could have came to my friends house but he refused. Things like this happen all the time with him but this one is still bugging me weeks later. So Reddit, aita?\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: my two friends are women. We left when he went to bed to not keep him up as he\u2019s a light sleeper. He also said at first he didn\u2019t mind if I left but he already seemed angry as I can tell and he was lying to me saying he was fine with it even though I knew he wasn\u2019t but I just wanted to enjoy the rest of my bday. Also him and I spent all day together 8am to 6 pm when people started showing up. We had also had a fight the night prior and he said he ruined my birthday and I told him he didn\u2019t if we could just go to sleep and have a good day the next day which was my bday. We have so many fights I don\u2019t even remember what that one was about I know it was over something stupid.", "created_utc": 1690054615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156t4o3/aita_for_hanging_w_my_friends_on_my_bday_instead/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had to be in bed on his own by his own choice for three hours!  How absolutely terrible\u2026 NOT!  Is he always this much of a self-centred baby?  I mean, I do always want to celebrate with my SO on their birthday, but if I decide I\u2019m tired and going to bed that\u2019s on me, I certainly wouldn\u2019t feel that I should stop him celebrating if he wanted to.

Does he do this frequently when you are about to spend time with people you care about? Pick fights in the way to social events so you enter feeling unsettled while he walks in like nothing is wrong? Withhold affection as a form of punishment? He may love you, and may be sweet to you at times, but no mistake, he is trying to control you. This behavior escalates!", "NTA. Not at all. Dump the bf. He will only become more controlling and less supportive. It\u2019s manipulation. Go have fun with your friends.", "NTA Wow he is an immature jerk.

Sure, he can decide at any time he doesn't want to be touched. He can feel frustrated that he can't fall asleep easily without you.  However he uses withholding of touch as a form of tit-for-tat punishment to something you didn't agree upon nor should you.  What's going to happen when you *have* to spend the night away from him? It may not be his fault that he struggles to sleep without you but it's still his responsibility.  Are you willing to tell about these other things like this that happen all the time? I'm seeing an alarming pattern here. Also IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY and he is choosing a conflict over that?  That's not a healthy cooperative teammate behavior like I'd expect or want from a partner.  \nThere's no practical explanation that could make this a valid argument.  You are not his medicated sleep aide. You're his partner. And he chose conflict.  He could have said \"I don't think I'm going to function well tomorrow because I don't sleep well without you so what can we do about it?\"  \nI get that lack of sleep means we don't think straight to a degree but at the end of the day, he has no excuse.", "Wait, wait, WAIT! Things like this happen all the time? Sis\u2026 I say this with care, this is VERY concerning behavior that will only escalate.  This feels like he is trying to isolate you.  You are so young.

Your bf needs to grow up, and you need to decide if he is worth waiting for that to happen", "NTA. Your BF withheld affection to punish you for what he perceived as a wrong you did to him.

Homeboy was in bed for 3 hours and he's making it sound like he just came back from war.\n\n\"He doesn't like to sleep alone\". Well tough titties, he's a fully grown man, not a child.\n\nThen the pettiness of refusing to cuddle you. Jesus.\n\nYour bf sounds controlling and incredibly tiresome. It was your literal birthday.

It is odd that you hosted a party then left with some of the partygoers to continue partying at their house, but then it sounds like him going to bed might have been the trigger for that anyway based on poorly communicated aims; on his side, he might have been trying to get people to leave so he could have time with you alone, and on your side it sounds like you were taking the party elsewhere so as to not interfere with his sleeping. From his response it sounds like the fact that you left, rather than who you left with, was the problem, but you mention that this isn't a rare thing; honestly, he needs to work on communication and drop the passive aggressive melodrama", "NTA  \nHe's a grown ass man, he can find a way to fall asleep without cuddles along with recognizing sometimes things aren't always about what he wants.

Not only was it your birthday but you are a grown woman and can do what you want without having to worry about this grown man needing cuddles before he goes to sleep. It would be different if your were just out all night every night and he felt alone but you were out celebrating and he refused to come so it was HIS choice to sleep alone.", "NTA.

Did he have to rent a \u201csleeping buddy\u201d to cuddle every night? Of course not!\n\nThis behavior is ALL about controlling you. Telling people what choices they must make is always an AH move.
