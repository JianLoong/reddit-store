Not a lot of people, a couple of his friends and family members and 2 of my friends. Everyone left around 10:30pm and at that point my boyfriend had decided to go to bed. I wasn\u2019t tired and wanted to celebrate more so I told him I was going over to my 2 friends house (the 2 that were at my celebration) for a few hours and I\u2019d be back later. He seemed annoyed but I left anyway. I came back a few hours later and he was SO pissed that I was gone saying I know he doesn\u2019t like to sleep alone and how dare I not care about his feelings (I do care, but I should be allowed to go see my friends) and go see my friends making him fall asleep alone. He then proceeded to tell me since he had to spend 3 hours alone in bed with no cuddles I had to sleep on my side of the bed and he\u2019d cuddle me in 3 hours just so I know what he had to go through. He said it wasn\u2019t about me seeing my friends, just the fact that he had to sleep alone for a few hours and it\u2019s not fair to him. I even tried to cuddle him and he pushed me off and said don\u2019t cuddle me , so I moved to my edge of the bed and fell asleep. He could have came to my friends house but he refused. Things like this happen all the time with him but this one is still bugging me weeks later. So Reddit, aita?\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: my two friends are women. We left when he went to bed to not keep him up as he\u2019s a light sleeper. He also said at first he didn\u2019t mind if I left but he already seemed angry as I can tell and he was lying to me saying he was fine with it even though I knew he wasn\u2019t but I just wanted to enjoy the rest of my bday. Also him and I spent all day together 8am to 6 pm when people started showing up. We had also had a fight the night prior and he said he ruined my birthday and I told him he didn\u2019t if we could just go to sleep and have a good day the next day which was my bday. We have so many fights I don\u2019t even remember what that one was about I know it was over something stupid.\n\nEDIT #2: Thank all of you for your comments and advice, after taking everything in our relationship and everything I\u2019ve read on here today into consideration I\u2019ve made the decision to leave him. I have nowhere close to go as no one in this area has room for another person, so I\u2019ve already made arrangements to stay with my mom 2 states away. I just have to actually get all my stuff out and myself out safely. Idk how he\u2019s gonna react-this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had to leave someone that imo could or has gotten violent- I\u2019ll provide an update on how that goes and when im at my moms. Again thank you all I really appreciate the words, some of them I really needed to hear to push me to the best decision for me. Cause this is just one incident, one fight, things are not good with us at all even though right now it\u2019s good I know it\u2019ll be bad again in a few days.", "created_utc": 1690054615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156t4o3/aita_for_hanging_w_my_friends_on_my_bday_instead/", "score": 786, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve been with my husband for 23 years (married 18 years) and your story reminds me so much of mine. The demands and irrational arguments will just escalate. Simply doing normal things with friends during normal daylight hours start to become a problem and lead to fights. It gets to the point that you stop making plans with friends just to avoid an argument. They make you feel selfish and uncaring, when in reality you do everything you can to make them happy but it\u2019s never enough. I am in the process of making my exit plans.

When you leave the house - put him in his crate.
