Not a lot of people, a couple of his friends and family members and 2 of my friends. Everyone left around 10:30pm and at that point my boyfriend had decided to go to bed. I wasn\u2019t tired and wanted to celebrate more so I told him I was going over to my 2 friends house (the 2 that were at my celebration) for a few hours and I\u2019d be back later. He seemed annoyed but I left anyway. I came back a few hours later and he was SO pissed that I was gone saying I know he doesn\u2019t like to sleep alone and how dare I not care about his feelings (I do care, but I should be allowed to go see my friends) and go see my friends making him fall asleep alone. He then proceeded to tell me since he had to spend 3 hours alone in bed with no cuddles I had to sleep on my side of the bed and he\u2019d cuddle me in 3 hours just so I know what he had to go through. He said it wasn\u2019t about me seeing my friends, just the fact that he had to sleep alone for a few hours and it\u2019s not fair to him. I even tried to cuddle him and he pushed me off and said don\u2019t cuddle me , so I moved to my edge of the bed and fell asleep. He could have came to my friends house but he refused. Things like this happen all the time with him but this one is still bugging me weeks later. So Reddit, aita?\n\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: my two friends are women. We left when he went to bed to not keep him up as he\u2019s a light sleeper. He also said at first he didn\u2019t mind if I left but he already seemed angry as I can tell and he was lying to me saying he was fine with it even though I knew he wasn\u2019t but I just wanted to enjoy the rest of my bday. Also him and I spent all day together 8am to 6 pm when people started showing up. We had also had a fight the night prior and he said he ruined my birthday and I told him he didn\u2019t if we could just go to sleep and have a good day the next day which was my bday. We have so many fights I don\u2019t even remember what that one was about I know it was over something stupid.", "created_utc": 1690054615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156t4o3/aita_for_hanging_w_my_friends_on_my_bday_instead/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It may not be his fault that he struggles to sleep without you but it's still his responsibility.  Are you willing to tell about these other things like this that happen all the time? I'm seeing an alarming pattern here. Also IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY and he is choosing a conflict over that?  That's not a healthy cooperative teammate behavior like I'd expect or want from a partner.  \nThere's no practical explanation that could make this a valid argument.  You are not his medicated sleep aide. You're his partner. And he chose conflict.

He's a grown up who should be able to go 3 hours without snuggles, or at the very least, without punishing you for his ridiculous expectations.", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s a bit sad. Is this a grown adult?", "NTA.\n\nLets recap everything in your post in chronological order:\n\nNight before - you guys have a fight and he says he's ruined your birthday  ... before you even have it. \n\nDay of - you spend 8-6 together.\n\nYOUR celebration is full of his people. Presumably mum, dad, sibling and at least 2 of his friends. You get to invite just 2 of your friends. Where are your family? And more of your friends? \n\nHe's tired and wants to sleep. You want to keep hanging out and talking with your people. Given he's a light sleeper you decide to go to one of their places and keep hanging out.\n\nHe decided not to go to sleep, to punish you for not doing his completely unreasonable want and withholds affection from you.\n\nAnd you say he does stuff like this regularly.\n\nQuestions: if your friends stayed at your place .... would he still have made a big deal and made you go to bed early and do what he wanted?\n\nIs this something you're happy doing for the rest of your life or do you want a more healthy and equal dynamic?", "WHOA you need to run. Fast and far!!! NTA", "It's your birthday,  you went out with girls he knows. He's being stupid and childish at best, at worst he's a childish control freak.\nAs a guy I find this behaviour on your special day concerning and warranting a serious look at the future of the relationship", "NTA\n\nYou are not his comfort object. \n\nIf he needs a lovey or special baby blanket to fall asleep - that's on him. But he is not a toddler and you are not his favorite blankey.", "Are you serious? A grown ass man acting like that?", "NTA he's tantruming and making your birthday about his feelings. He's a whole adult he can sleep alone.", "There are partners out there who won\u2019t do this to you or treat you like this. You\u2019re NTA. Cling to those friends - you\u2019ll need them when you decide this relationship has run it\u2019s course and that you deserve better.\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "Spoiler alert. He\u2019s only gonna get worse. You\u2019re only gonna fight more and more. Leave now. Even babies are capable of sleeping alone", "You are a person, not a teddy bear. NTA", "This is definitely controlling and manipulative behaviour, without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nEveryone saying \u201cLeave him\u201d is right, but the reality is not always just as simple as that.\n\nTrying to leave someone like this is often complicated, simply because they are irrational people and might be capable of things that haven\u2019t yet manifested themselves (physical violence etc.).\n\nThe reality is that it\u2019s only going to get worse over time though, that is true.\n\nAs people age, they generally tend to become more set in their ways.  Personally, I\u2019d never be able to live with someone who thinks they are running a dictatorship.\n\nRealistically, there isn\u2019t a happy future for the OP in this relationship.  If it\u2019s safe for her to think about working towards leaving her boyfriend, it\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nEven if OP thinks she loves this guy, there\u2019s someone far better for her out there who will treat her with the respect she deserves and who\u2019ll make her a lot happier.", "Ditch. His. Ass.", "NTA:  wtf\u2026.", "NTA - I think your bf needs to work on managing his emotions and expectations of you. Like, I can understand not wanting to sleep alone. The selfish part of me wants my partner to always come to bed with me so I can have that security, but that's not a feeling I get to manifest into reality. For him to have that expectation gives me the impression he values his feelings and desires above yours, which is not good at all so he really needs to work that out.\n\nThe fact that you're both fighting constantly sucks. Even being as optimistic as I can about his motivations and behaviour, that still indicates to me that you have some communication issues you need to work out if the relationship is going to improve. And that's *being optimistic*. If its straying into abusive territory then that's not a healthy relationship to continue.", "Why are you with this man?  He is a walking bundle of controlling red flags.  A nearly 30 year old man who cAnT sLeEp WiThOuT hIs CuDdLeS???!!  He is making you feel bad about having a good time without him so that he can ensure in the future you will cave to his controlling behavior and isolate yourself from your friends.  This is just the first step in this process.  Get. Out.  Now.  NTA.", "NTA - Honey, he picked a fight with you before your birthday, then again on your birthday. Give yourself a wonderful present and respect yourself to see his tactics for what they are.", "OP, you are not his security blanket. You are not something he gets to 'use' to help himself sleep. He's holding you emotionally hostage, and he's abusing you further by putting the blame of his discomfort on you. So... you just don't get to have a life and have to be there for him and his weird bed needs at all times? And then he punishes you for it by 'depriving' you of cuddles? Dude, I'd be telling him to get his bitchy ass on his side of the bed and not to touch me at all or he'd get a kick if he talked to me like that. I probably would have broken up with him by now, tbh. \n\nThis is not healthy. Why are his friends/family coming to YOUR birthday party and not your friends/family? He's mad because you went out with YOUR friends. Please talk to a counsellor.", "Also, doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s avoiding cuddles for 3 more hours, which he claims to need (well, enjoy) to fall asleep? At best, sounds like a chopping your nose to spite your face situation\u2026", "According to OPs bf I\u2019m probably \u201cabusing my poor husband\u201d because he usually goes to sleep 3 hours before me. The horror!!!! He misses out on snuggle time everyday! I guess I have to start calculating the snuggle loss to make up for my severe deficit\u2026../s\n\nOP needs to ditch this guy. No one \u201cowes snuggles\u201d, and who the f keeps count? Just enjoy the snuggles and love you have. \n\nHope OP finds someone to treat her right. Someone WORTHY of her cuddles and snuggles and love.\n\nETA: I really hope that\u2019s the bday present she gives herself. Freedom from this loser and maybe even finding a new guy in her life. One who treats her right.", "I read OPs Post and was like: \u201eoh.\u201c now i read your reply and: \u201eOH.\u201c i think you just gave me the Push i needed.", "I ha a sexy lookd never heard of a \"vag drier\" before, but you are absolutely right! Being that controlling is not a sexy look.", "Lol, I hope his is worst he has to go through. Imagine going to sleep while your significant other goes to socialize. The horror. \n\nImagine being so confused why is he acting like that.", "And also notice that most of the people at HER birthday... we're his family and friends? This is really giving me some majorly sketchy vibes here.", "No no\u2026 that is God\u2019s gift to women!\n\n/s", "If you did this as a 13 yr old to mama parents would get you therapy and your friends would make you the laughing stock.

Dressing it uo by denying cuddles doesn't change that", "This is very much not cute. My best friend dated a guy who got mad that she stayed up to do crafts and watch Friends with me instead of going to bed when he did. He was majorly abusive in more ways than one and this is just one way to maintain control.", "Dougie Downer", "At this point, why are you in this relationship with all this arguing?  The whole thing sounds unpleasant and exhausting.", "NTA and you know deep down the relationship is over. The fact you can\u2019t even recall when one fight ends and the next begins shows you aren\u2019t happy.  It really is better to be alone than lonely in a relationship.", "Omg 3 days?! Buy his ass a body pillow and a heating pad. Geeezzzz! Talk about needy. It's your birthday and that's all he cares about? Damn. I wouldn't be spending his birthday with him. He's acting like a child.", "why is it odd? 1030 really isn't late, esp for someone in their 20s", "Seriously, what is odd about her decision?  \n\nShe wanted her birthday part to last longer and she was being considerate of his sleep.", "Ok, Grandpa.", "You are NTA, but I would encourage you to re-evaluate this relationship.

He needs to be able to trust that your friendships are platonic and that you'd shut down attempts from other guys crossing boundaries.  It's not that he doesn't trust men. He doesn't trust you.
