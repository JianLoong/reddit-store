{"id": 32021, "submission_id": "1877eyw", "title": "AITA for asking my wife to look for a job after I already agreed that she wouldn't work for a year?", "selftext": "My wife and I got married 2 years ago and have been together for 7 years. She gave me my 2 fantastic step sons and 6 weeks ago blessed me with a daughter. Now.. our daughter was planned. I wanted at least one biological child. She told me at that point that if she were to have a baby, she would want to stay home for at least the first year so she could exclusively breast feed and I immediately agreed. We were in a good financial position, we had money stashed away in multiple different accounts. We were set. So I did agree to this, which probably makes me an AH.\n\nBut our finances are not doing so hot anymore. It's not even her fault. My brother stole $25k off of us (got a hold of me and my wife's joint bank info some how- I am pressing charges but lawyers said this could take months to even be put in front of a judge).  I cannot make this work on just my income anymore because we are only left with $3k in the bank account and our rent is $2800. So I asked my wife to look for a job and explained why. She immediately said \"I fucking hate you\" and walked off. I was able to reapproach it later (she locked herself in the bedroom crying) and she said she is rethinking our marriage now because the one thing she asked for is that she gets to stay home for a year and I agreed to it and now I'm asking her to send her kid off with a complete stranger and give up exclusively breastfeeding and she is sickened by me. Said she never would have agreed to have a baby with me if she had known I would back out of our agreement 6 weeks in. Said that my brother stealing thousands from us is something I need to fix on my own because it's my family and if I force her to work she will 100% divorce me, no question. Am I wrong in asking her to get a job? She will barely speak to me now and won't look me in the eye at all. Cries a lot. But I literally cannot do this financially without her. (Yes she gets child support from the boys dad and it does help out but not as much as I need).\n\nETA: my wife's reaction was not bold. I wanted a child. She told me for easily 3 months straight that her only stipulation was that she didn't work and straight up told me before even getting pregnant that she would never forgive me if I backed out and changed my mind about her staying home for a year. 90% of the money that my brother stole was money she worked overtime for, just to ensure that she did not have to work. So no, it's not bold. I don't even blame her. She begged me and warned me not to back out on it, given that it was her only request and that's exactly what I did. She says I'm just as untrustworthy as my brother and a part of me feels like that's true. I didn't keep a good enough eye on my brother, which is how he even got a hold of our bank info (it was in my wallet, that I left in the car when he was in there one day). Now she is suffering be cause of my family fuck up. I'm at a loss but no, she's not being bold, insensitive or rude. She warned me and I did the exact thing I promised her I would not do. $25k is ONLY what we had saved for the bills. We have separate accounts saved for each kid. \n\nMy brother and I are twins. Despite not technically being identical, we look a whole hell of a lot alike. He took my info, he went to the bank and withdrew/closed out the account. He didn't have my ID. The bank asked him my security questions and last 4 of my social, which he knows. Handed over the money to him immediately following and closed my whole account out. I didn't even know UNTIL my paycheck couldn't be delivered. I called the bank to ask what the hold up was. They told me that I closed the account 4 days prior. I argued it, they showed me the surveillance feed to prove I did it and it was my brother.

That\u2019s not how it works ,especially with withdrawals over 5k , if getting 10k is a headache how could a bank just hand someone 25k without making sure the people on the account know about it?

The solutions here have nothing to do with your wife working. \n\nStep 1: you rain hellfire on your brother and have him give you anything back that he hasn\u2019t already spent IMMEDIATELY. You blast him to your parents, siblings, family, his employer, his friends. EVERYONE. You blow up his phone and email every day all day. You make him so miserable that he just wants you to stop and go away and the only way to get you to do that is PAY YOU BACK. \n\nStep 2: You go get a line of credit or some kind of loan. You use this as backup if you have any financial difficulties before your $25k is repaid. \n\nStep 3: You go get yourself a raise, or work overtime, or a second job, and you start hustling to regain the money that was lost. That way if you don\u2019t get paid back, you still have some cushion. And if you DO get paid back, it\u2019s bonus money. \n\nMeanwhile, leave your wife alone. Not her mess, not her problem.

If not for a full year then for much longer than 6 weeks.", "No the answer is not for her to get a job its for you to get a second job.  The spot you are in is 100% your fault.  You need to fix it not her.", "I'm stuck on the detail in your comments that your wife didn't even know about the theft until the conversation about her going back to work. Look at this from the other side for a second, she was at least reluctant about having another child in that she wasn't comfortable doing that and working, and was upfront that this was a full-on dealbreaker for her, and worked overtime to make it happen. And the baby appears to be your idea. And then not six weeks after having the kid, you sit her down, announce your brother has stolen $25k from you two and she needs to go back to work instead of doing the thing you agreed to.\n\nWhile it's not really an option for your family to starve if you can't afford for her to stay home, this was not the way to have a conversation about options here. First off, \"my brother stole $25\" should have been a conversation she was allowed time to digest without dropping how dire the situation is. The second thing is that you should not have said \"so you need to go back to work\" but more a \"we can't afford the family's expenses on just my income without those savings, we need to figure out what we could possibly do to keep a roof over all our heads,\" and actually problem-solve this issue as a *team*. And actually given her time to think about ideas (and for *you to also think about ideas*) that she was okay with before putting, \"one option is you go back to work\" on the table when you know that's the one thing she asked of you before having the kid.\n\nSo YTA. Whether you're right or wrong about her *needing* to return to work, you did approach the *actual conversation about the financial situation* in an asshole way.\n\n(Also, the fact is that you are making enough to meet the family's basic needs, and you say there are a few other accounts for the kids and for child support. Maybe if you actually brought it up with her as a problem-solving-as-a-team thing, you'd have found she could make the stay-at-home thing work using the child support money you're not aware of the details of and by penny-pinching and reducing the budget for any expense that could be lowered, you didn't even try and that makes it sound like you just want her working.)", "YTA\n\nYour brother stole her money and now you're trying to force her back to work after you promised her she didn't have to work.

At the very least you should have approached the subject with an apology, an exact breakdown of your financial situation and asked her what she thought a good solution might be - perhaps she could take a part time position working remotely so she is still at home with the baby but is able to help you get the finances straight.

Because normally you need to \u2018order\u2019 cash in advance and they are very stringent.\n\nMost likely OP is full of shit", "My mom wanted $10,000 cash.  She was pissed because the bank was charging her a fee to give her a check for that amount, but not cash, so she decided to get cash out.  She had to give a couple days notice, fill out a form, and show a photo ID.", "You think it\u2019s more plausible that this bank is the only bank that\u2019s cool with handing out $25k to a walk-in without ID, than OP lied to cover his ass?", "Might be testing to see how plausible his story is before actually confronting his wife. I'm not sure I believe it, but I've seen weirder on this sub.", "Definitely not what FDIC is for but good try. However they almost certainly do have separate private insurance against fraud.

It took me entirely too long to make him quit.", "The one thing I hate about the laws here is parents can get credit cards and loans and stuff using their kids social security, even when the child is a minor. This ruins the kid financially, often before the child can walk or talk. \n\nI think the kid can press charges when they are an adult, but a lot of people have a hard time doing that to their own parents. \n\nI just think it should be illegal to use social security numbers for that sort of thing when the person is still 13 or younger. And then the number can only be used for the person it\u2019s assigned to.

Where tf do you bank that their cameras are so behind the times?", "Yeah a lot of banking rules aren\u2019t that intuitive. It\u2019s possible not all banks have the same rules but it seems to me they needed you and your ID for purposes of opening the new account rather than closing the old one if I had to guess.", "I'm going to suggest NOT buying anything, including flowers.

This hey do you have your ssn and some lies for me and then I\u2019ll just send you 20k or whatnot in American is pure mad", "Why 13 and younger? A 13 year old is still the responsibility of their parents and can't legally sign a contract. Parents should not be able to get loans out in their children's names at all.

Link just goes to whole post", "Yeah otherwise why is he seemingly not pressuring the bank at all\u2026?", "And his card had the account and routing number on it per his second to last comment. \n\nThis isn\u2019t how debit cards work\u2026", "I still think if this story is true it's bullshit though. You can't tell me any sane bank would accept someone walking in without ID, without a bank card for the account, cashing out over 20k and CLOSING a joint account without it being suspicious.  He would have to sign documents, hell that's not the kind of transaction you can do at most tellers. And lets say this brother did do this and the bank was stupid enough to do all this without it raising any red flags. There is no way the bank doesn't have good enough footage to tell who was at the bank. They don't have the same eye colour, don't have the same hair colour and aren't even the same height. He says they look similar but even then they aren't going to have identical faces. If he signed anything it's a forged signature. There is a lot OP should be able to do to prove theft and that it is the fault of the bank.", "I worked at a bank. In no universe would they allow a $25k withdraw without id. Actually I believe at my bank a withdrawal that high you needed multiple forms of identification(tho is is not standard everywhere), and we needed to physically type the numbers of your DL into the system to process to be able to hand that amount.

Just to have me back out. So she said I'm just as untrustworthy as my brother because 90% of that saved money was actually hers.
