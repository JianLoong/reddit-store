You could even hate all FPS/MMO games and that still wouldn't matter. Single-player or casual games are all still video games.\nNo one genre of video games are above others, there are just genres that are built around or lend themselves better for competition.\n\nSorry to say but this comes across to me as potentially sexist. Many women have to endure being called \"fake fans\" if they take interest in a hobby that's male-dominated, and that's what this basically is. To me your boyfriend sounds pretentious and immature.\n\nIf any of my friends seriously called themselves \"gamers\" and looked down on people who don't game competitively, I'd honestly call them cringe and embarrassing.\n\nHe's still fairly young so I hope to god he grows up, but you were absolutely NTA.

I've met a ton of dudes who tried to gatekeep me and other people (male and female) from gaming throughout my life because of inane reasons like \"you don't play enough games\" or \"play the wrong kind of games\".
