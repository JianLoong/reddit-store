Ignore any gatekeeping jerks, they aren't worth listening to. It sounds like you're pretty awesome and your boyfriend sounds like he's being an pretentious idiot in this case. I hope it's not a red flag or anything but it could be. Also, what's wrong with stuff like Mario? It's fun, video games are meant to be fun! Just like books or movies or music or TV shows. It's all just entertainment, gatekeeping it can only make it less accessible to others and that's just pointless because no one gains from that. In short, you are absolutely 100% NTA.", "NTA.

Why would you not be allowed to say that you like video games around other people???

You play games and enjoy them that's a fact.\n\nBeing a \"gamer\" is your boyfriend's personality and an important part of his self identity and image.
