Ignore any gatekeeping jerks, they aren't worth listening to. It sounds like you're pretty awesome and your boyfriend sounds like he's being an pretentious idiot in this case. I hope it's not a red flag or anything but it could be. Also, what's wrong with stuff like Mario? It's fun, video games are meant to be fun! Just like books or movies or music or TV shows.

To ask someone to avoid mentioning you like something because it's not main passion is incredibly dumb. I couldn't imagine being in a relationship with someone that would come out with something this stupid and this petty. I can only imagine there's some sort of weird 'games are for boys' subtext going on here because if there isn't then he's in the running for dumbest man alive.  Sexism makes it worse, but my brain will stop hurting trying to figure out wtf is running through this man's brain.", "I've been playing FPS video games semi-daily with my friends since I was like 15. Started taking them more seriously and playing competitively on in-game ladder around 2016.\n\nWho the fuck cares if you only play minecraft, sims 4 and animal crossing ? You could even hate all FPS/MMO games and that still wouldn't matter. Single-player or casual games are all still video games.\nNo one genre of video games are above others, there are just genres that are built around or lend themselves better for competition.\n\nSorry to say but this comes across to me as potentially sexist. Many women have to endure being called \"fake fans\" if they take interest in a hobby that's male-dominated, and that's what this basically is. To me your boyfriend sounds pretentious and immature.\n\nIf any of my friends seriously called themselves \"gamers\" and looked down on people who don't game competitively, I'd honestly call them cringe and embarrassing.\n\nHe's still fairly young so I hope to god he grows up, but you were absolutely NTA. Don't let him or his friends bully you for not being a \"real gamer\".", "NTA - You didn\u2019t say you were a serious gamer, you just said you like video games. That\u2019s true so where\u2019s the problem? Gatekeeping hobbies is dumb.", "You \"shouldn't say you like video games\"? What's his deal? People like or don't like things all the time, and it definitely isn't pretending to be an expert saying you *like* something.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nAt all", "NTA\n\nHi, I'm a woman who works in games. Your boyfriend sucks. His stance is immature, condescending and misogynist, and you should expect better from someone you're dating. \n\nGames are just a medium, like anything. Like books. Like movies. There's nothing inherently remarkable about the things he plays vs what you play. Don't let him make you feel small for what you like.", "NTA. And I find your boyfriends behavior so strange and silly. That is all.", "NTA,play whatever you like,whenever you like,and he can gtfo,been playing online for years,and have never experienced this kind of attitude.", "I bet his whole personality is video games. How lame. NTA and expect an apology from him for gatekeeping", "Your boyfriend is weird NTA", "He sounds like he spends a lot of time on Reddit. Hi H, stop being a reddity asshole.\n\nNTA.", "I also play games (and develop them) but if someone calls themselves a 'gamer' I wouldn't expect anything good.  Very toxic and salty community.\n\nObviously NTA.", "If he plays any online competitive/combat games, secretly start playing it in your free time until you get really good, and then without revealing who you really are, find him in the game and DESTROY him. If possible, teabag his corpse as you reveal who you truly are, and then revel in your mastery! That would *definitely* put an end to his bullshit, forever and onward.", "The hell is wrong with your boyfriend?  The best way to get more guys to show up to LAN parties is the presence of a few gamer chicks.  But what do I know, I haven't hosted one since the turn of the century.", ">He said that I barely play games and that when I do it's just minecraft or super Mario's games\n\nBoth of those are GAMES and ridiculously succesful ones too.\n\nYour boyfriend is an idiot.\n\nYou like video games........what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nThere is no time limit you have to reach to \"unlock\" the ability to say \"i like video games\".\n\nNTA and again, He's an idiot", "Right? I have a few different nintendo consoles for the sole purpose of playing every lego game that they have....though now that I type that out it sounds less casual than I meant it to...lol\n\nPoint is, I don't play them every night and those are really the only games I play (aside from like Mario cart on the Wii) but I still like video games.\n\nOP, you are NTA", "My nearly 60 year old mom calls herself a gamer because she will occasionally play Mario party with us (her 30+ y/o kids), and we all happily accept her as the leet gamer bro she is lol.", "You didn\u2019t. At all. But listen, don\u2019t let your BF control the way you interact with your guests for the gaming party you\u2019re planning. If you\u2019re \u201cnot allowed\u201d to actively participate as an equal, call the party off. There is no middle ground here.", "True", "For the record, his behaviour is not unique. Take it from someone who does game studies: a certain group of male gamers can be extremely condescending, and it usually ties to other unsavoury opinions about women. It might well be an isolated comment, just keep your ears open. \n\nAnd don't apologise/smooth it over to end the awkwardness. You don't want to  set a precedent. Some things, noone should get away with.", "Girl no. My husband is a game designer and I\u2019m just a normie who plays hogwarts legacy and dragon age, and he doesn\u2019t even pull this shit. Your BF can go kick rocks. Don\u2019t settle for someone who puts you down for simple likes.", "Lmfao sad sad sad. Gamers aren\u2019t a protected class. Grow up.", "If you game as a hobby, casual or competitive, you can call yourself a gamer. Gonna be frank with you, this is cringe and embarrassing behavior.\n\nStop making gaming your personality, it's weird.", "Until then, I will defend you with my Vorpal blade! (or a katana)", "You are comparing hobbies against work. A gamer is a person who enjoys gaming. She's not a esports gamer."]}
