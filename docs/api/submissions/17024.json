NTA. Why would he or anyone get upset if you say you like video games? You're not claiming to be a pro or an avid gamer, just saying you like video games should not cause any negative reaction? That's honestly so weird of your boyfriend to say and it honestly sounds like gatekeeping. Don't feel bad for enjoying what you enjoy and saying that you enjoy it.", "As an avid gamer, your bf is a dunce. You can like video games casually. NTA.", "lol, what a loser. Sorry your boyfriend is an idiot op. NTA.", "So by this logic only career alcoholics enjoy a glass of wine, professional gamblers enjoy a game of poker, literary critics enjoy reading, triathletes enjoy playing sports, adult film stars like sex, and chefs enjoy cooking?  Spare me. You ain\u2019t the asshole here", "NTA tell him 'filthy casual' was just a meme, no one takes it that seriously.  And if they do, that's not someone you really want to be talking to anyway.", "What the f\n\nNTA \n\nYou really have nothing to feel bad about", "Nta. That is so odd. \ud83e\udd28", "Why is he gatekeeping video games?", "NTA. Don't say you like having fun, only hedonists like to have fun and you might offend one.", "NTA. Is your boyfriend one of those weird people that complains that new female characters aren't sexy enough or tells people to \"get gud\"? What a ridiculous reaction. Lol. I'm a 40-90 hour a week gamer and my girlfriend is casual who mostly likes to play Minecraft. She's honestly better at shooters than most of the people I know. When we were younger I had a few guys ask if she was really any good and they would generally accept that she's beaten the first 4 Gears games on insane and stop, but I don't think I've heard anything about \"girl casuals\" for a long time. What a strange, outdated and childish thing to say.", "I'm really hoping that the ages are fake and you two are 12, not 20 and 21. Your BF's attitude is outrageously immature. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour bf is gatekeeping, and shit like this is really common sexism among gamers. They find a million reasons to say girl gamers are not real gamers", "Lmao NTA", "NTA. You're allowed to say you like video games. What a weird thing for him to gatekeep.", "NTA.   He is gatekeeping.   There is room for all types of gamers, casuals AND tryhards, in the gaming community.  :)", "NTA.

Kinda confusing on why he is mad. The only thing I can think of is that some gamers get weird around gamers that are girls because they can be socially inept. Otherwise he\u2019s being kinda weird, you like whatever you want to like.", "NTA. Good Lord. His argument is absolute nonsense. Seems like the kind of person who needs to realize there's more to life than games.", "NTA . Your bf logic is .. well stupid ..", "NTA, your bf is a childish moron. Mario and Minecraft are just as valid games as Call of Duty & Portal.", "Nta he sounds insane", "Wait so an avid gamer plays 4-5 times a week? Those are rookie numbers! You gotta pump those numbers up!\n\nBut in all seriousness gatekeepers can get fucked. Enjoy gaming as you do. It's weird he doesn't like that you like gaming in all honesty. NTA", "NTA, but your bf is.  When his friends come over come out in a Super Mario shirt and tell them you are excited to be playing video games today.", "Lovely intelligent guy you got there.  Nice job.  He's a keeper.", "NTA. Your boyfriend doesn't get to decide how you describe yourself or your affinity for video games.", "NTA. Gamers like this hate casual gamers. These people spend their lives playing games. These gamers hate to go out and only socialize online. Do you want to stay home and never enjoy anything outside your front door cause he refuses to leave this games?

It may indicate other controlling behaviors.", "NTA\n\nThat's just....completely weird for him to act like that. He's wrong.

He's just a jackass who wants to gatekeep gaming and claim people who don't live and breathe whatever he does aren't \"real gamers.\"\n\nNormally that kind of attitude is a peek into the gaping abyss of a deeply misogynistic worldview that involves incels, men's rights, alpha males, and women as objects/maids/sex toys.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if at least ones of his friends is a serious creep.\n\nNTA", "No, he is absolutely the one acting weird.

It\u2019s weird he said that to you.", "Second this, either one of his friends is a \u201cgirls can\u2019t be gamers\u201d gatekeeping purist or he is one himself and is just not saying anything to you because he knows you would get mad.  \n\nAs an avid gamer who doesn\u2019t have a penis, I met soooooo many of these.  50% of whom if you proved you were a \u201creal gamer\u201d would do a complete 180 to \u201cjackpot, I\u2019ve found the mythical gamer girl and she will surely have sex with me\u201d.  As if they weren\u2019t berating me a minute ago for being fake.  The other 50% just get saltier and saltier as you beat them in whatever game they\u2019re playing.", "You should see the 180 they do when you have an ambiguous username, whip their butts in a game and during the congratulatory/shittalking chat afterward, they figure out you're not a guy. \n\nI swear some of them would have been killed by the whiplash they would have suffered if they'd whipped around that fast IRL."]}
