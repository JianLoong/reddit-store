Jesus christ. \n\n>I'm not looking after someone else's kid.\n\nHomie that ship fucking sailed when you married a man with a child. \n\n>I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time.\n\nWanting a vacation with your family is fine. Deciding that your stepson doesn't count as family is fucked up beyond belief and definitely makes you an AH. YTA", "YTA do you really think anyone thinks this *my family* business is acceptable? He became your family when you married his father. And drawing a distinction between the status of your child over his child is quite obscene IMO.", "YTA\n\nLike, you're one of the biggest AHs I've ever seen on this sub, and that's really saying something. You shouldn't be allowed to be a parent. My heart is absolutely shattered for that poor little boy. I don't know what's broken in your brain or soul, but there's something deeply, pathologically wrong with you.\n\n>I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. \n\nThat little boy IS your family, and it's staggeringly awful that you keep repeating over and over that he isn't. You and his father are the only meaningful, involved parental figures that he has. HE IS YOUR FAMILY. And I have no words to describe how appalling it is that you would keep insisting that he isn't.\n\n>I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. \n\nYou mean YOUR HUSBAND'S kid? The child who doesn't have another mother figure in his life in any meaningful way other than you? Is this honestly how you see this child, who has been living with you full-time, 24/7/365 for the last half-decade?\n\n>My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. \n\nThen your husband is also an AH.\n\n>I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable.\n\nYou're wrong. You're objectively wrong. From every possible angle, through every possible lens except a flat-out sociopathic, sadistic one, you're wrong. You're literally trying to argue that a little boy who has no other family than you should be excluded from your family vacation because you didn't \"choose\" or give birth to him, and you don't want him. It's not reasonable, it's fucking monstrous.\n\n>My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).\n\nOf course you think it's unfair. His mother literally abandoned him, and you don't want him either. Your mother is a kind, empathetic person who very reasonably thinks that when you marry someone with a child, and that child has no involved mother figure in their life (and you literally have children of your own and ostensibly are capable of maternal feelings and behaviour) that the logical thing would be to \"bring him into the fold\" so to speak and treat him as your own. You see a child whose own mother didn't want him, you get into a relationship with his father - not only his parent but his only family - and see an excuse to separate him further from that one stable figure.\n\nYeah, she's definitely the one who's got the skewed POV.\n\n>She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got.\n\nAs your mother rightly pointed out, your stepson doesn't have anyone except you and your husband either. His mother abandoned him. For all intents and purposes she is not his parent and hasn't been in years. She gave up all custodial rights. That doesn't change because you don't want him either, any more than your son's father is going to rise from the grave if your husband decides that he doesn't want to be the boy's dad. \n\nYou're the only real mother this boy has, and what a sad state of affairs that is, because you've made it very clear that you don't even see him as family. YTA. A big stinking AH.", "YTA\n\nAbsolutely, 100%.\n\nYou married his father, which means your stepson IS part of YOUR family. \n\n>my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT.\n\nHa ha ha... Technically, your stepson doesn't have another parent, he has an ~~invubagkr~~ incubator/egg donor who doesn't want him. You are going to tell him you don't want him either and that is a shit thing to do.", "YTA and the fact that you provided justification for your decision just shows how much you in fact don't like your step-son or see his as YOUR family. Just because his mother is still living doesn't make him less apart of your family. At least it shouldn't. If your husband had full custody and he lives with you full-time he IS your family. Also, how do you think you step-son will feel when he sees the people who he considers his family all leaving without him. Did you for one second even consider how your step-son would feel? I guess not. Your husband sounds just as awful. I feel terrible for this child. Do better!", "Let me see if I can get this through your thick head - *stepson ALSO doesn\u2019t have another parent!!*. His mom *left* and *never came back* because she wanted \u201cfreedom\u201d and a fresh start from her child that she *birthed and was supposed to love and care for no matter what*. He doesn\u2019t know her. She is effectively a stranger. You are incredibly callous and selfish for even trying to do this. \n\nAnd \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for caring for a child that isn\u2019t mine\u201d. Yes. Yes you did, the moment you married this man. Just like he signed up for being a father to your child who lost a parent. I\u2019ll bet your kid\u2019s dad would\u2019ve moved heaven and earth to stay here with your son. Stepson\u2019s mom CHOSE to leave him and no longer wanted him. Step up and be a decent human being for the sake of this child, if you didn\u2019t want to be his mother you shouldn\u2019t have married his dad. \n\nYTA times a thousand, and that poor kid. He\u2019s got no one to fight for him in this world.", "From a child whose step mother treated her own children better: you are an unbelievable asshole, and you should be ashamed of yourself.  How fucking dare you.\n\nI feel bad for him because if this would even cross your mind, you probably treat him worse at home too.\n\n>just MY family JUST once\n\nYou married his father.  You are his family.  And in his family, you are the evil stepmother.", "YTA and a crappy step parent.", "Wow, YTA. Also, just evil! So you and husband each married both bringing to the marriage a child from a previous marriage/relationship. \n\nLet\u2019s twist your story. Your husband gets a HUGE bonus. One that can take his family on a dream vacation. He tells you that he wants ONLY his wife and HIS children. That you need to find a place where your son from your first marriage to stay while you are gone. I don\u2019t care if you are widowed, he is not his son by your standards. \n\nLet\u2019s take the knife and twist it, your son hears how he cannot go because he is not \u201cfamily\u201d. How do you think a child would receive this message? He is pretty much abandoned by his mother, and his evil stepmother is also telling him that you are rejecting him as well. \n\nBecause of your actions, let\u2019s go to the future. Your stepson is getting married. He tells his dad that he can come but you, the evil stepmother, are not invited and not allowed to attend. You are also banned from his children\u2019s lives. Why, you will ask. Remember this day. It all started and began with YOU. \n\nI\u2019m betting he has his own stories he can share about you and your hatred for him. And shame on your husband for allowing this let alone staying with a woman who will never accept his child.\n\nAnd how do I know this? I\u2019m an adult now but grew up with stepmom like you. Step fathers as well. I don\u2019t call them my parents, just AHs\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards for my comments. The greater reward is for the OP to grow up and become a human that has a heart.", "YTA and so is your husband, your husband isn\u2019t just an AH but also a horrible father for exposing his son to someone like you.\n\nYour 10 year old shouldn\u2019t be allowed to go on this vacation either because he isn\u2019t your husbands son. so if stepson misses out, then so should your son. It\u2019s only fair if we go off your stupid messed up logic.\n\nI feel sorry for this poor kid, I bet he is left out of a lot of things. Toys? Treats? Food? God knows what else.\n\nYou honestly disgust me\u2026.", "YTA. Your stepson became *your* family when you married his dad.", "From your comments and the post you confirm that your stepson has practically no relationship with his biological mother and you\u2019ve been in his life since he was 4. For all intents and purposes, you are his mother. If the situations were reversed, and your husband said he wanted a vacation with \u201conly his real family\u201d and said to send your son to your mothers, would you do it? \n\nMy stepmom pulled crap like this, and now because of her meddling like this, I have a very strained relationship with my dad. You are going to destroy your husband\u2019s relationship with his son if you keep this up. Shame on you.", "OMG YOU ARE SOOOOO THE ASSHOLE. I had a stepmother who pulled this shit and we *hated* her for it. Your stepson and husband came as a package. You took on your husband, therefore you took on his child. He must already feel like a spare part- do the right thing by him and treat him like one of your own- before your husband finds a partner who will. **YTA**", "YTA x 10,000 and your husband is an AH x 10,500 for agreeing with you.  I can completely understand you not having the same feelings for your stepson as you do for your biokids, but what you are proposing is downright CRUEL.  All that little boy will see is his entire family goes on vacation and he gets left out.  There's no amount of explaining to him or rationalizing to him that would make up for that kind of gut-level heartbreak and pain.  \n\nI can't begin to fathom why your husband would in any way be okay with this.  A decent father would have shut you down 2 seconds after you suggested excluding your stepson.  I feel so sorry for this poor kid.", "YTA, big time. I'm sorry, I realize how much sacrifice is involved in parenting a stepchild but, that's what you signed up for. It seems mean and unnecessary to say your stepson has another parent (compared to your son's loss) when you explain stepson's mother gave him up and has no custody (and presumably little if any involvement in his life). Think about this from his perspective - YOU want to take YOUR 'real' family on vacation and from his, but to him it would be HIS family vacationing without him while he stays with a parent who didn't want him. That's terribly sad and frankly seems like it could cause irrevocable harm. \n\nMaybe there is some room for you to get a break from the responsibilities associated with his care, but your view that it's 'looking after someone else's kid' is toxic and sad - he is your husband's bio child and your stepchild, just as your son is your bio child and your husband's step. Would you ever tolerate your husband saying the things you've said, that he wants to take HIS real family - excluding your son - on a big trip? Come on now.", "YTA, your stepson is your family hence the term stepson.  He is your husband's child, that's family.", "YTA. Yikes! How were you going to explain this to your stepson?

You knew exactly what you signed up for, and your behavior here is disgusting.  \n\nHe is your family.  \n\nYou never need parent another person's child.  Step n parenting is completely voluntary.
