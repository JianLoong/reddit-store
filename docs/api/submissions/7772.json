It\u2019s a very sweet gesture that you consider her as the first daughter of your husband, it\u2019s fair, and she\u2019ll be grateful to you forever. Your MIL shouldn\u2019t have spoken out of place, promising the ring to your 14YO daughter. It was not cool. What you can do is have a piece of jewelry that you can get and promise to your 14yo. Something special that will be only hers. But I applaud you for putting your step daughter first and not separating her from your family. Talk to your husband about it. He needs a lesson in compassion.", "I'm appalled that it sounds like the only person not treating Sam differently from the other kids is her stepmom.

That ways it\u2019ll be your bond with her too. It might not be the same but you can have her help you design the ring too.", "NTA...the line \"I love the ring, I love Sam more\" really touched me. No matter what happens with the ring, Sam is likely really happy to have you in her corner.", "NTA. It was his mother\u2019s. It is yours now. You decide what you want to do with it. That said, I agree that passing down the ring while alive is weird; what do you wear after?", "I think you are NTA.  It seems like a very nice gesture. But I am also confused. Why do your husband and his mother want to skip his first child in the ring inheritance.  I might understand it if you tried to skip your step daughter, but why would her parent and grandparent do that?", "NTA but your MIL is a huge AH for not viewing Sam as her granddaughter and your husband is an AH for going along with it. It's beautiful that you are continuing the family tradition with Sam, especially since her own mother is no longer around and her grandmother obviously views her as second class. I'm glad that she has you to advocate for her since clearly her own bio relatives can't be bothered.\n\n>his argument is that both have equal right to the ring\n\nWhy do they both have equal rights when traditionally it goes to the oldest daughter. Sadly, your husband views his own daughter as less than. Hopefully nothing ever happens to you because who knows how he'd treat the daughters that you share if he ever got remarried.\n\nEdited to add: You and your husband should also have a conversation with the 14yo about the ring, to clarify that you are following family tradition in giving it to Sam and that grandma had no right to promise it to her. The last thing you want is to encourage resentment between the sisters, especially since grandma might be looking to stir the pot. In fact, you should probably keep a closer eye on how grandma interacts with all three of your children to ensure that she isn't stirring up resentment between them.", "There's one big issue I have with this but first, it'll think you're NTA.\n\nThe fact that he doesn't want to give it to his daughter is VERY strange.

But I think you are doing the right thing to give it to Sam. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut I gotta ask... Why is grandma so against this? Sam is her granddaughter too. And obviously there wasn't a problem with giving it to Sam's mother at the time..", "i think he is TA.  he doesn\u2019t want to give it to his own daughter?  it was her mothers, who died when she was six. Of course it would make her feel closer to her mother. and traditionally, wouldn\u2019t it go to the eldest daughter?\n\nI guess it\u2019s the fact that they were never married that\u2019s making both him and his mother refuse her daughter the ring?\n\nIt seems your 14-year-old wants the ring, because it was promised to her, which I can understand, and because she likes the ring. Sam on the other hand feels an emotional attachment to it and feels it will bring her closer to her mother. I think those sentiments should trump anything else\n\nI think the fact that Sam is not your daughter by blood but you are standing up for her, is lovely\n\ndefinitely NTA but I don\u2019t envy your situation.

A 14 year old doesn't need it right now does she?", "NTA.  Talk to your 14yo daughter and explain the situation.  Then take her out for a day with you and Sam and buy her a \u201cbest little sister\u201d ring.", "NTA. \nGive it to Sam. It would be a beautiful way to honor both her mothers. And when you get one that is your very own, you can give it to the 14 year old when she marries.", "Nope, its totally fine. Just go with it. That is your ring now and you can give it to your daughter. Grandma giving promises to your daughter on your behalf is the ahole move in my opinion", "Info.

To skip your oldest grandchild because her parents weren\u2019t married is crazy. I\u2019m sure grandma told the 14 year it\u2019d be hers just for this reason. Your husband needs to tell mom her bad treatment of older daughter needs to stop. I\u2019m guessing the older daughter realizes she is treated differently? I\u2019d tell my 14 year old her older sister is getting the ring because her mom had worn it too and she is the eldest granddaughter so it is hers now.

Your husband should be thanking God for you every day.\n\nAnd your MIL had no business promising your ring to anyone.", "NTA. But you would be if you have into MIL's hateful bias for your middle child over Sam", "Nta. This is step mom of the decade award worthy. I commend you for your commitment to being fair. It\u2019s rare, but inspiring. I really like the idea to create 2 nearly identical replicas with their own twist for each daughter. That seems like a really cool tradition to start. Because of your Grace and judgment, I\u2019m so confident in your decisions that I\u2019m changing Not the asshole to never the asshole or VRTA (very rarely the AH).", "NTA. \n\nI think the one getting married first has a right to it. (If there is such a thing as a right to it)\n\nI'm also assuming your MIL is religious (or \"traditional\") to classify the 14 year old as her first official grandchild... So that's just ridiculous and AH ish in my opinion.\n\nNot sure what the deal is with your husband being upset about it. Sam is still his daughter too.\n\nDo what you want with it.", "NTA. Honestly, your MIL sounds awful, saying your 14 year old is your first 'real' grandchild. No she isn't, Sam is. The fact that your husband didn't fight back against that is terrible of him too.

She doesn\u2019t get to choose again. \n\nSam is the most justified to receive it, given its links to her own mother.

Give it to Sam", "NTA - It is your ring, your MIL does not get to decide who it goes to.\n\nYou need to however grill your husband for allowing it to happen without even telling you at all. \n\nYou also now need to fix the mess that both the MIL and husband has created. You need to sit both your 14 y/o daughter and Sam down and explain why the ring is going to Sam and also show another piece of jewellery/ring that can either buy now or claim you kept hidden just for your 14 y/o. Doesn't matter if you need to fabricate a story or not, that's up to you.", "NTA and it's so great that your step daughter has you, since it sounds like the rest of your husband's family are not there for her. You love Sam, give her the ring. Come up with a whole new tradition for the rest of the kiddos. Sam is seeking a connection between the mother she lost and her future family.  All of your kids still have you and that connection and there is time to forge new symbols of your family's love.", "NTA - please give it to Sam \nIt will be so much more sentimental to her", "Nta, if you are renewing vows next year and getting another ring, that one can go to your 14 year old when the time comes. Sam got the first daughter ring and your 14 year old gets the second. Start a tradition with you and her", "NTA.\nHowever, you should honor your MIL's wishes in this case.", "YWBTA.  Don't give away your wedding ring while you are still married to your husband.  You know that he doesn't agree with giving it to Sam.  You would be stirring up trouble.  There is time to think about passing on the ring when you are no longer wearing it.", "Honey. You are NTA at ALL. It is a beautiful and kind gesture to give the ring to Sam, and her mother would be so pleased that Sam has a such a wonderful woman like you in her life since she can\u2019t be there for her baby girl. Well done.", "NTA that's is Sam's ring! I'm curious just because my brain went there, if Sam's mom was in possession of said ring when she died and was not married to OPs husband Sam is her mother's only heir. That makes the ring even more Sam's ring as she should have inherited her mother's possessions.", "What the fuck?! Tell the grandmother she sucks and that her overlooking Sam is gross. Also, tell her that if she pushes this that you will tell Sam that her grandmother wants her sister to have the ring because she feels Sam isn\u2019t an \u201cofficial\u201d grandchild.\n\nGive Sam the ring and give your husband divorce papers. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGive it to Sam. Your husband needs to support you and Sam, not his mom whose being quite an AH to say Sam isn\u2019t his first child! Your 14yo will understand and get over it, don\u2019t involve a child.\n\nDon\u2019t let him promote that MILs thinking at all - regardless!", "NTA. You consider Sam your daughter. She should be considered the first granddaughter.", "It should be Sam\u2019s. NTA, OP.", "NTA as the situation is described.\nSam is the eldest daughter and thus has the right to matriarchal heirlooms, that's how it works. And kudos to you for building such a beautiful relationship with your oldest daughter\n\nGrandma is an asshole no matter how you slice it. This isn't 1750, a child of wedlock is not a second class citizen. \n\nI don't know if this is the case, but is it at all possible your husband just doesn't want to give away the ring and he's going along with grandmas bs just so it isn't passed along for a while more? I recall my folks had a similar situation where my mom wanted to give my sister her ring and my dad flat refused because the ring had so much history with them as a couple.\nThis guy gave this ring to the woman he loved twice. I think it's understandable if the real reason behind this is that he just doesn't want to part with it. It might not be the case, but op, I think it's worth asking the question.", "NTA. What a great person you are!\n\n1. By every avenue of logic, the ring should go to Sam. The connection Sam has to it is even stronger than what anyone else would have. Her connection to it through both you and her mother is wonderful; your loving heart for Sam is wonderful, too.\n2. Your MIL's attitude toward Sam is horrific, and your husband's tolerance of it is also horrific.\n3. The ring stopped being your MIL's to control when it was given to Sam's mom. It has been yours to control since it was given to you. Reinforcing that thought: Sam connects that ring to you and her mom because that's who had the ring for the past 17 years.\n4. I'm sorry that MIL and hubby have made it an issue with your 14 yo. I hope that you will be able to talk with her and help her see past the skewing sentiments of her dad and grandma. Frankly, by the time she is considering marriage (1) you may be able to give her your renewal ceremony ring, (2) her fiance may have their own special family ring that she will want to wear - or she may no longer want to wear a ring... you just don't know that far in advance.", "NTA your MIL is just mad Sam was born out of wedlock.\n\nYour MIL wants to give the ring to your 14 year old, her \"first official grandchild\" but Sam is your husband's daughter from a previous relationship?? Am I reading this right!? The 18th century called, they want her back in their timeline.", "If the ring were to go to Sam, it's very strange that your husband gave it to you.(not your fault of course you had no idea). I always think of Family ring should go to not the person coming into the family but who is already in the family. (if the bride is the blood family member, her family should allow the groom to propose with it/or if it's a wedding band give it to the bride to use as her wedding band). \n\nI think you should however not dismiss your husband's feelings.  You should have more conversations about it", "Let your husband take lead on this. If he wishes to give the ring to his 14 year old, let him tell his 25 yo daughter. Don\u2019t be the bearer of bad news, let him do it.", "Oh! What if OP picks out her new ring with her 14yo, uses it for her vow renewals, then gifts it to 14yo when she's getting married? I think that'd be such a sweet idea.", "Plus Grandma is only trying to stick it to Sam because she was born out of wedlock. As if she had anything to do with it.", "You\u2019re a good person. It\u2019s sad that your MIL and husband don\u2019t have your love and compassion for Sam. Give her the ring and refuse to feel anything but happiness over this decision. Shame on your husband and MIL. NTA", "That\u2019s very smart and beautiful!!!", "Seriously. Unless OP knew when she accepted it that it was *actually* just on \"loan\" until whenever MIL wanted to reclaim/give it to someone else, this situation is fully unacceptable. MIL cannot promise it to anyone.", "Thank you!!", "She is, but she's a *gasp* bastard. \n\nBastards are wanton and cunning by nature, and Sam will surely steal more of OPs other kids stuff in the future, just like she stole this ring.\n\nOh wait, this is the real world in 2023, not Westeros.", "Your mil is the AH and your husband is aiding and abetting.", "Ooof. Your MIL sounds like a real treasure. \n\nAnd so nice of your husband to allow MIL to treat Sam like she\u2019s second class! I\u2019m sure they both make Sam feel good about herself. \n\nSam is lucky to have you. Give her the ring, tell her you love her, and best wishes to you both.", "Definitely give it to Sam. It's so gross to punish the child for the circumstances of their birth.", "YIKES", "That's pretty awful. Thank you for doing right by Sam. Sounds like she deserves this ring.", "For having that opinion alone would mean to me that none of her other opinions matter. NTA.", "That would make a completely different design of ring from the one she likes though.", "Damn I thought Sam was like from another marriage when first reading this. Like it actually wasn\u2019t her grandchild but this is just ridiculous", "I've also never heard of someone giving a ring to be used as a wedding ring and then dictating who it should be passed on to later. Once it was given to OP, it was OP's to decide who inherits the ring. \n\nThere's so much \"that's not how this works\" here. But OP is NTA", "It\u2019s different when its a family heirloom. Most families that pass on wedding rings/engagement rings do so when the current owner is alive, it makes it a bit sweeter imo.", "My Dad's finger did get caught in a machine!  If his ring wasn't there, he would have lost a finger.  His ring is lovely.  Yellow gold at the top and bottom, white gold filagree in the middle.  The ring is still bent and a section of the filagree is gone.  Nobody else wanted it because it was broken, so I have it.  I also have my Mom's wedding and engagement rings.  I don't take it off.  I like having both rings in the same place.  It's like keeping my Mom and Dad together.  They died many years ago.", "I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\n\nThat\u2019s a lovely sentiment, keeping their rings together, just lovely.", "I love that she said it was a way to honor both of her mothers. I can just imagine how she would feel when she looks at it her hand. She\u2019s lucky to have you and it sounds like you are lucky to have her.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re TA but a wedding ring is generally seen as a symbol of your marriage and you\u2019re giving it away. To me (and possibly your husband) it seems that you don\u2019t care about your marriage. If you were divorced I would understand but not while married, I know my mother has specified which rings get given to which daughter when she dies but it doesn\u2019t include her wedding ring (she\u2019ll be buried with that)", "ESH.\n\nOkay, so the ring was originally your husband\u2019s GRANDMOTHER\u2019s wedding ring. Your MIL inherited it after her mother died. In other words: Your MIL did not get the ring prior to death. This is NOT a long-standing family tradition of turning this ring over prior to the ringbearer\u2019s death. \n\nYour MIL gave the ring to your husband when he was ready to get engaged to Sam\u2019s mother. This is critical. This is the whole point: Your MIL gifted the ring with the idea that it was going to go to her son\u2019s wife and be part of a shared memory of marriage.\n\nBut Sam\u2019s mom didn\u2019t want to get married. So while she wore the ring for a year, the ring never fulfilled its intended purpose for your MIL. She justifiably resents that, but her resentment should be aimed mostly at her son, who misled her, and to a lesser degree at Sam\u2019s mom, who should not have kept the ring under the circumstances.\n\nShe has unjustifiably carried this resentment forward to the next generation and is lashing out at Sam and treating her effectively as an illegitimate child trying to snatch away her family\u2019s goods \u2026 which is hurtful and nonsensical. Sam is her granddaughter. Nothing changes that reality. Your MIL is just being cruel to Sam. \n\nBoth your MIL and husband are TAHs for attempting to further delegitimize Sam by arranging for the ring to go to your middle child instead. They are saying that Sam doesn\u2019t count. There\u2019s nothing about the tradition that says that it goes to the eldest, but deliberately routing the ring to the middle child sends a clear signal about Sam. And it\u2019s so much worse because the ring is no longer theirs to give! It\u2019s yours! They are completely out of bounds, and your husband, in particular, is failing to step up to support his oldest daughter. It honestly sounds like your husband knows that he messed up in giving Sam\u2019s mom this ring under the circumstances and is trying to fix it by giving into your MIL\u2019s demands now, which is wildly inappropriate.\n\nHaving said all that and acknowledging that you don\u2019t feel that strongly about keeping the ring and would like Sam to have it, Sam should NOT have asked for the ring. Again, no, this family does NOT have a longstanding tradition of passing the wedding ring prior to death\u2014You\u2019re literally the first generation to have gotten the ring! Your MIL got it as part of her inheritance, not prior to her mother\u2019s death. Passing on rings is normal once a tradition has been established, but it literally hasn\u2019t been established yet. Sam had no reasonable expectation of getting the ring prior to your death, and it\u2019s completely inappropriate to ask someone to give you their wedding ring. Sam is very lucky that you were gracious about it, but it doesn\u2019t erase the magnitude of poor taste in her asking for it.\n\nAnd, yes, you\u2019re a little bit of TAH here (in the smallest sense). You are acting passively over a matter that concerns you the most. It\u2019s your wedding ring! Yes, you talk about loving the ring but loving Sam more \u2026. But also discuss a vow renewal and getting a new ring. You talk about the tradition of the ring as a reason Sam would get it now when Sam asks \u2026 but YOU are the first person that gets to truly set the tradition and that ring is also the wedding ring of the only mother your other children have. Your MIL and husband were wrong to promise the ring to your middle child, but she\u2019s still going to be devastated\u2014And why is Sam more entitled to the ring than your other children? Give the ring to Sam if you want, but don\u2019t hide behind nonexistent tradition and be honest if the reason you are so comfortable giving the ring to Sam is that you want to ditch the ring anyway and Sam will take it off your hands sooner than your other kids will.", "NTA.  MIL blames Sam for being born out of wedlock.  That\u2019s disgusting.  You should throw that in your husband\u2019s face and tell him it is going to Sam.  Before that though, I would sit your middle child down and let her know why MIL is prejudiced against Sam, how it is cruel to blame a child for how they came about, and that ring was worn by Sam\u2019s mother before it went to you. She lost her mother and really deserves that connection, while your daughter still has her mom and the favor of MIL.  Ask her if it feels right to let Sam have a lasting connection with her mom?", "tell grammy dearest to give the 14 yr old a ring if she wants her to have one so badly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, it's absolutely a kind thing to give the ring to Sam. I don't understand why your husband would object or why he would try to involve the 2nd oldest.", "YWNBTA also what the holy fuck is \u201cfirst official grandchild\u201d", "NTA. It\u2019s so beautiful that you want to share the ring with Sam.", "Y'all need to go low contact with grandma and keep her away from Sam. She's awful.", "OP give ring to rightful owner", "NTA", "NTA. The ring was given to you. Your husband\u2019s mother no longer owns it. It is your choice who to give it to and when, not hers. I really hate when grandparents downgrade a grandchild based on whether the parents were married or not. Sam is her son\u2019s daughter. Therefore, first official granddaughter.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIt is your ring now, you can do what you want (as in giving it to Sam). \n\nYour MIL sounds very traditional. Folks like that care a lot about reputation even if Sam is her own bloodline. When you mention your 14 year old is consider \"official grandchild\", that is imply that Sam is born out of wedlock (aka bastard?) since Sam's deceased mother did not want to get marry. This is completely silly. Sam is just as much carrying the family blood (genetic wise) as the other 2 grandchildren.", "INFO\n\nIs it normal where you live to give up your wedding ring while you are still alive?", "NTA.  The grandmother's favoritism of the 14 y.o. over her oldest granddaughter (and your husband's support of this) is painful even for a complete stranger to read about.  It's your ring.  You make the decision.  Give it to Sam.  You know why, and so does everyone with a heart and a modicum of judgment.", "Also the ring was originally Sam's mother's ring...it makes sense for it to be passed on to her and your husband's daugther.\n\nI love how close you are to her and that you clearly treat her and love her like she's your biological daughter.  You sound like a lovely person.\n\nSquarely NTA.", "Give it to Sam. NTA.", "Please do. How heartless that just because her parents weren't married she's seen as less than. \n\nAnd how cruel for your husband to use the 14yo like this!\n\nMay I strongly advice individual's and couple's counseling before you renew your vows with a man who has treated *both* your daughters so shamefully?", "Why do you let her see any of your children if she is literally disowning her oldest grandchild?", "This is the way. After you give the ring away to Sam, have a matching one made to wear with the intention that you will eventually pass it down to middle daughter when she gets married.", "Because people are nasty to illegitimate children. I have two legitimate siblings, guess which of us grandma cut off when dad got married? The one of us who knows there's three siblings, not two...", "Was not expecting a LOTR reference but I am here for it! Cheers mate.", "That would still be giving it to the 14 year old. Sam would only get to wear it for a few years until the younger sibling takes it over for the rest of their life/until they give it to their own kid? That\u2019s just not a reasonable solution at all.", "If anything, that would give MIL even less right to vote in my opinion. Give it to Sam if you want to, it it a connection to both mother figures. Pick or create a new heirloom for our 14yo daughter. MIL and husband had no right to promise the ring to anyone.", "Its really hard to believe people actually still think this way. Absolutely disgusting. \n\nNTA  and give it to Sam. Her bio mom is gone, its a beautiful gesture. Btw, you are the stepmother every child deserves. I wish i could hug you right now on behalf of Sam and her bio mom. You are also exactly what bio mom would have wanted since she cant be around. You are a beautiful soul. Your MIL? NSM.\n\n\nEdited sp.", "Gross", "Doesn't matter, some people are assholes about illegitimate children. My father's mother was. But she has legitimate grandchildren now, she doesn't need me anymore...", "I don't disagree with your sentiment, but you have contradicted yourself in the reasoning behind it; is not birth order a circumstance of birth? Therefore, if it's not right to punish someone based on the circumstance of their birth, whether legitimacy or birth order, then on what grounds does the eldest deserve the ring over the middle child?  \n\n\nIMO eldest child should have the ring because OP, who is the current possessor of the ring, desires to give it to her, and she meets the criteria of 'family member'.", "Me either. I always thought engagement rings could be family rings, but not wedding rings.", "You can purchase him a silicone wedding band to wear if he wants!", "They make rubber ones designed to snap away if it gets caught.
