Sam or your 14yo kid?\n\n\nNTA, OP. The ring should go to Sam. It\u2019s a very sweet gesture that you consider her as the first daughter of your husband, it\u2019s fair, and she\u2019ll be grateful to you forever. Your MIL shouldn\u2019t have spoken out of place, promising the ring to your 14YO daughter. It was not cool. What you can do is have a piece of jewelry that you can get and promise to your 14yo. Something special that will be only hers. But I applaud you for putting your step daughter first and not separating her from your family. Talk to your husband about it. He needs a lesson in compassion.", "I'm appalled that it sounds like the only person not treating Sam differently from the other kids is her stepmom.

That ways it\u2019ll be your bond with her too. It might not be the same but you can have her help you design the ring too.", "NTA...the line \"I love the ring, I love Sam more\" really touched me. No matter what happens with the ring, Sam is likely really happy to have you in her corner.", "NTA. It was his mother\u2019s. It is yours now. You decide what you want to do with it. That said, I agree that passing down the ring while alive is weird; what do you wear after?", "I think you are NTA.  It seems like a very nice gesture. But I am also confused. Why do your husband and his mother want to skip his first child in the ring inheritance.  I might understand it if you tried to skip your step daughter, but why would her parent and grandparent do that?", "NTA but your MIL is a huge AH for not viewing Sam as her granddaughter and your husband is an AH for going along with it. It's beautiful that you are continuing the family tradition with Sam, especially since her own mother is no longer around and her grandmother obviously views her as second class. I'm glad that she has you to advocate for her since clearly her own bio relatives can't be bothered.\n\n>his argument is that both have equal right to the ring\n\nWhy do they both have equal rights when traditionally it goes to the oldest daughter. Sadly, your husband views his own daughter as less than. Hopefully nothing ever happens to you because who knows how he'd treat the daughters that you share if he ever got remarried.\n\nEdited to add: You and your husband should also have a conversation with the 14yo about the ring, to clarify that you are following family tradition in giving it to Sam and that grandma had no right to promise it to her. The last thing you want is to encourage resentment between the sisters, especially since grandma might be looking to stir the pot. In fact, you should probably keep a closer eye on how grandma interacts with all three of your children to ensure that she isn't stirring up resentment between them.", "There's one big issue I have with this but first, it'll think you're NTA.\n\nThe fact that he doesn't want to give it to his daughter is VERY strange. It feels like there's something missing to all of this.\n\nEdit: I'm aware that you both have a child together but it seems like picking who's loved more and that's the strange part.", "Whew, that's a tough one. But I think you are doing the right thing to give it to Sam. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut I gotta ask... Why is grandma so against this? Sam is her granddaughter too. And obviously there wasn't a problem with giving it to Sam's mother at the time..", "i think he is TA.  he doesn\u2019t want to give it to his own daughter?  it was her mothers, who died when she was six. Of course it would make her feel closer to her mother. and traditionally, wouldn\u2019t it go to the eldest daughter?\n\nI guess it\u2019s the fact that they were never married that\u2019s making both him and his mother refuse her daughter the ring?\n\nIt seems your 14-year-old wants the ring, because it was promised to her, which I can understand, and because she likes the ring. Sam on the other hand feels an emotional attachment to it and feels it will bring her closer to her mother. I think those sentiments should trump anything else\n\nI think the fact that Sam is not your daughter by blood but you are standing up for her, is lovely\n\ndefinitely NTA but I don\u2019t envy your situation. Somebody\u2019s gonna get hurt no matter what you decide. maybe sit the two girls down together\nto discuss it?", "NTA - not clear though - Sam is also her grand daughter right?  Is it because her mother never married your husband?  \n\nA gift is a gift - it is now yours to do with as you please.  If she still wants to carry on like she owns it, she shouldn't have given it to you.  \n\nMaybe Sam could pass it to the other daughter in you know, 15 years time when she might get married?  A 14 year old doesn't need it right now does she?", "NTA.  Talk to your 14yo daughter and explain the situation.  Then take her out for a day with you and Sam and buy her a \u201cbest little sister\u201d ring.", "NTA. \nGive it to Sam. It would be a beautiful way to honor both her mothers. And when you get one that is your very own, you can give it to the 14 year old when she marries.", "Nope, its totally fine. Just go with it. That is your ring now and you can give it to your daughter. Grandma giving promises to your daughter on your behalf is the ahole move in my opinion", "Info.  Sam is your husbands daughter, right?", "INFO: why the middle and not the oldest? They\u2019re both her granddaughters\u2026", "It\u2019s your ring. Do what you want. NTA", "NTA it should go to the oldest daughter. Her mother wore it and you have it now. Grandma is not a good grandmother. To skip your oldest grandchild because her parents weren\u2019t married is crazy. I\u2019m sure grandma told the 14 year it\u2019d be hers just for this reason. Your husband needs to tell mom her bad treatment of older daughter needs to stop. I\u2019m guessing the older daughter realizes she is treated differently? I\u2019d tell my 14 year old her older sister is getting the ring because her mom had worn it too and she is the eldest granddaughter so it is hers now.

Your husband should be thanking God for you every day.\n\nAnd your MIL had no business promising your ring to anyone.", "NTA. But you would be if you have into MIL's hateful bias for your middle child over Sam", "Nta. This is step mom of the decade award worthy. I commend you for your commitment to being fair. It\u2019s rare, but inspiring. I really like the idea to create 2 nearly identical replicas with their own twist for each daughter. That seems like a really cool tradition to start. Because of your Grace and judgment, I\u2019m so confident in your decisions that I\u2019m changing Not the asshole to never the asshole or VRTA (very rarely the AH).", "NTA. \n\nI think the one getting married first has a right to it. (If there is such a thing as a right to it)\n\nI'm also assuming your MIL is religious (or \"traditional\") to classify the 14 year old as her first official grandchild... So that's just ridiculous and AH ish in my opinion.\n\nNot sure what the deal is with your husband being upset about it. Sam is still his daughter too.\n\nDo what you want with it.", "NTA. Honestly, your MIL sounds awful, saying your 14 year old is your first 'real' grandchild. No she isn't, Sam is. The fact that your husband didn't fight back against that is terrible of him too. I bet Sam really wants the ring as proof that she's not just the spare, because clearly no one else is making her feel good about her place in the family.", "NTA, MIL had no right to say who gets the ring, it\u2019s yours to do with what you want. It\u2019s odd that MIL skipped right over the oldest grandchild in \u201cpassing down\u201d the ring but again, it isn\u2019t hers to give.", "NTA - It's your ring that was freely given to you and when it got passed to you it became your right to pass along how you wish. \n\nAlso why do I get the impression they don't like Sam?", "There might be resentment either way. 14-year-old already has her heart set on it. So does Sam. It should go to Sam, it sounds like from the tradition, but it might blow up the relationship between you and the middle daughter and/or the middle daughter and Sam.

Maybe give her the renewal ring eventually?", "I was going to say N A H until the \u201cfirst official grandchild\u201d comment.

I don\u2019t understand how you could wear a ring that binds your marriage for 16 years and have no agency in who it should then go to? MIL already made her choice when she gave it to her son. She doesn\u2019t get to choose again. \n\nSam is the most justified to receive it, given its links to her own mother.

Its a ring, and while 14 was promised the ring and all that, in the grand scheme of things, it should always have been Sam's, skipping you entirely.

Not sure how it came to you, but if it were me, I sure as heck wouldn't take the ring and give it to my new wife. \n\nI think if you talk to your MIL about it and explain your thinking you might be able to come to some sort of understanding here.
