Doesn\u2019t sound like you were. Then you stalked her online after that, bc she\u2019s just so enamored with you and your smoking hot bod, right? Leave her alone.", "You disagreeing doesn\u2019t change my ruling. She should get over herself.", "It seems people are misinterpreting my comment.

That's when the manager came in. I stalked her later because I was concerned about the other photos she had taken, but you're right, I probably should have absolutely let it go. I'm still just worried she's going to post a photo of me. Probably a little irrational on my part. :)", "A handfull did it and then the internet reposted it endlessly, creating a moral panic in certain parts of the internet."]}
