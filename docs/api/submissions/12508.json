The first time you asked her not to, she should\u2019ve apologized and stopped. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are in the photo or not. Taking photos where people are undressing IS weird.

At all.\nI worked in/managed a gym for almost 5 years, and I would have absolutely been the first to help revoke that membership. I understand taking progress photos, and a lot of people want to get that photo just after a workout because that's when it's gonna look the best. But you have to know your surroundings, and if there are other people in the locker room(especially someone in a towel or that's changing), just kindly wait for them to leave. Even if they aren't in the frame of your picture, they probably don't know that, and that can make a lot of people uncomfortable.
