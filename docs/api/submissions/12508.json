Gyms have a rule regarding photos on premises in general (generally not enforced on the floor at many places). It is to protect privacy and the other members. This lady was knowingly violating said rule as you are generally required to agree to these terms WHEN you sign up.\n\nIf you see these photos online with you in them, report them appropriately.", "Nta the locker room is not a private photo booth for anyone.", "NTA.

A changeroom is for changing.", "NTA ofcourse it seems like there is no more privacy in this world! Good for you for speaking up.

She can take selfies  on her bathroom at home", "NTA, most changing rooms have a no photos policy for obvious reasons", "NTA - Taking photos in a gym locker room is NOT cool. There are multiple news stories out there of people, even famous people, getting banned from gyms for this behavior.", "NTA. My gym has a no pictures in the locker room policy. From the sounds of it, so does yours. You didn\u2019t you anything wrong. You didn\u2019t break the rules.

You had and have the right to be upset and the manager taking steps to revoke her membership reflects that.", "Ugh. If she\u2019s taking selfies because she\u2019s trying to be an influencer or whatever, I get it, but you don\u2019t do that when other people are around.\n\nShe can\u2019t be oblivious in those sorts of situations, which she obviously was, and then compound it by refusing to be respectful of others. \n\nEven if she was taking pictures of the locker room for a review, she should do that when no one else is in the locker room. Or you know, ASK for their permission.\n\nBasically, there\u2019s no circumstances under which she was in the right.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA for your very legitimate concerns and reaction.", "NTA. In my opinion, anyone should be able to be feel comfortable in a gym, especially in a locker room. Gyms should have rules of no photos or videos taken in gyms, or at least very limited.

Most gyms have firm rules around phone / camera usage in locker rooms, for good reason. She was being ridiculously selfish and inconsiderate.

Well, good for the gym for protecting its members. \n\nNow let it go.

My first reaction was: Wait a minute, someone was taking pictures in the locker room (where people are changing, in a state of undress, etc.)?
