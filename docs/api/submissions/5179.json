Karma is not looking good for him.", "NTA. Your story made me cry. You\u2019re an angel for providing for the kids. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility, yet you stepped up.

He clearly doesn't care about Christmas. That's fine, not everyone does. OP does celebrate Christmas and thought their Dad did too, given the information I understand why that would be a bit shocking as it felt out of the blue (but given the other details.... really wasn't out of the blue). BUt... gifts should not be looked as mandatory.  \n\n\nBut take it for what it is, just don't celebrate with him anymore. He has his priorities, you have yours. And that's fine.

He also requested a specific PC game and then added that if we get him that, he'll obviously need a gaming PC, crazy keyboard and headset. Our youngest (9) can only talk about V bucks (fortnite money). All he wants is friggin cash/gift cards to buy \"skins\" with his V bucks (it's fecking weird if you ask me). \n\nWe did buy the Xbox but it will be labelled under the tree as a \"family\" gift because this amount of money better benefit us all! I could never imagine spending such amount for myself or even one other family member. The kids will end up playing it more of course and we are well aware that we're really splurging on them this year but we've been frugal over the years, always buying game consoles that were much older than the current stuff and this year we decided we would get them the latest and greatest for once (this is not an every year thing). We got extra remotes and we will all enjoy a good game on Christmas day when they open it up. \n\nBut I'll admit, I'm starting to get disillusioned when it comes to Christmas gifting for kids. They still have no concept of money and how it's made and they want the latest trends and anything else that they unwrap ends up with a mediocre \"ah, a book/clothes/toy, thank you\" \\*quickly discard to open another gift and never looks at it again\\*. \n\nWe got a pool dug out last year (which I and the kids really wanted) and spend a shit ton of money on this and the deck to surround it.
