Take all the gifts back home and have Christmas at your place, sounds like he's going to be busy with his games anyway and probably won't care. So sorry, OP.", "NTA... That was very nice of you to think of your family members, your dad is totally the AH here", "NTA. You're sweet to do all you can for your siblings for Christmas.

Fine, he can spend his money how he wants, but, he doesn't get to complain about not being to able to provide for Xmas when he can somehow afford a ps5. For the money he spent on that system, assuming he didn't also buy into ps+, he could have easily gotten a tree, a few decos at the dollar store, a few decent gifts and still had money leftover to get together a nice meal from the grocery store.\n\nEdits: I didn't realize a ps5 was goddamn $600.
