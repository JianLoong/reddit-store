Sarah has a 16-year-old sister \"Tara.\" Tara lives with their parents, but Sarah and Tara have a very rocky relationship with their parents. Nothing too bad, but it's toxic nonetheless. \n\nFor the last 6 months or so, Tara has begun staying over at the apartment that me and Sarah share. I've always been somewhat uncomfortable with this, mainly because it's common for Sarah, who works from home, to let Tara skip school and come spend the day with her. She says it's better than her being on the streets but I digress. My biggest problem is that Tara trashes the place and has no respect for me. Tara does not like me. I don't know why, Sarah does not know why. She is incredibly disrespectful to me and my things, eats my food despite being told not to on a nearly weakly basis, and \"borrows\" this from the apartment with no intent to ever return them. \n\nI've been at my wits end over this for the last month and I feel like Tara is testing my limits more and more. I've talked to both of them and let them know if something doesn't change soon I will lose my cool. But every conversation ends with Sarah committing to things that never happen and Tara being noncommittal or just disinterested in my feelings.\n\nIt came to a head Friday. Sarah had gotten off work early and left Tara alone. I came home to the place absolutely trashed. This I could handle, what I could not be that Tara had pulled out some of my vinyl to listen to, scratched them to shit and just left them out on the table and ground when she got bored. When I confronted her and asked her what happened she just shrugged her shoulders and said nothing. \n\nI absolutely lost it. I told her exactly what I thought of her. How she was selfish, ungrateful, lazy, and downright unpleasant. I made the comment that if this is how she is at home, I now know why her parents don't want her in their house. I could tell she was taken off guard by my yelling, and the parent's comment caused her to start crying. I kicked her out and told her not to come back. \n\nSarah lost it and we fought. We've been pretty cold since then. She's talking about moving out, but at this point, I'm starting to consider that myself. Last night, however, Sarah finally decided to tell me that Tara tried to run away last year, and she made a deal with her that our apartment could be her safe space whenever she needed it so she didn't run away again.

Sarah promised her sister your apartment as a safe space without asking you, and Tara\u2019s consistent toxicity makes your home an unsafe space for you. Your home has to be a safe space for you and Sarah, first and foremost. Let Sarah move out and take Tara in. Let this relationship go. Sarah makes promises to you she can\u2019t keep, Tara treats you like crap, let it go. You were forced into the role of a surrogate parent to a troubled teenager you can\u2019t set boundaries with. You won\u2019t win this. It\u2019ll never end. Sarah is more committed to her sister than to you. It\u2019s understandable: the kid has no place to go and no one else. But unless you want to be involved in this mess, you need to get out of it. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. Sarah may think she's being a safe space for her sister, but she isn't. She's enabling Tara to skip school, enabling her to be disrespectful to you and your property, enabling her to bail on even the smallest of responsibilities like picking up after herself. In short, Sarah is actively harming her sister by watching her decline and doing nothing to help.", "[deleted]", "NTA. And Tara isn\u2019t the only one who is. Neither of these gals have any respect for you. Keeping secrets, wrecking your stuff no remorse, no regard\u2026 If she wanted to make your home a safe space for Tara, you deserved to be part of that conversation and decision. \n\nWalk away now. It won\u2019t get better. Sarah insists on enabling Tara\u2019s immature, entitled behaviors and sees no need to change. They aren\u2019t worth your headache or heartache.", "NTA. Sarah's inaction over Tara not treating you, your belongings, or your home with respect is a huge problem. She is clearly disregarding and probably excusing Tara's poor house guest behavior, which is not going to help or prepare Tara to be out on her own eventually. Sarah is not treating you as an equal in the home, and if that continues then honestly there's no sense in living together.  Ground rules need to be set and **enforced** if  Tara wants to stay with you, and Sarah needs to commit to that fully.", "NTA \n\nOP - there are two real problems here, neither of which is Tara. \n\nFirst, Sarah offered your shared apartment as a bolt hole without discussing it with you. Even if the discussion was \"I told her she could escape here, make yourself OK with it,\" it still needed to be communicated. \n\nOnce the problems started, she needed to be on board with boundaries. That needed to include consequences, and those needed to be agreed upon beforehand and enforced. \n\nYou and Sarah need to learn to communicate better if you want to stay together. \n\nAlso, Tara needs someone to enforce boundaries, and sometimes losing your temper is a good wake up call. \n\nIf you want to stay with Sarah, after you get on the same page, I recommend sitting down privately with Tara - or with Sarah, but she doesn't get involved - and talk to her about acceptable behavior in your home. It sounds like Sarah and their parents are treating her like a little kid, and someone needs to talk with her more similarly to an adult. Let her help formulate consequences, and even negotiate boundaries within reason - within your idea of what's reasonable. \n\nBasically, tell her you're going to ask her for what you'd ask from an adult. If she wants to be a little kid, she has her parents' house.", "Girlfriend is TAH. She cannot decide safe space without talking to her SO.", "**NTA** \\- You are being taken advantage of.  You are probably better off without Sarah.  Children will recreate their family of origin with all its toxicity.", "NTA. Sarah and Tara are both being manipulative. Sarah should have told you she offered your apartment to her toxic sister. Sarah is doing her no favors by letting her skip school. You would be better off without both of them. Tell Sarah that she is right she should leave. This will let you know what is underneath the manipulation.", "NTA, it's unfortunate that she has an unstable environment at home but she is old enough to know better.\n\nMy concern is more with Sarah. I understand looking out for your sibling and I respect the sentiment of providing that \"safe space\" for Tara rather than running away. However, it appears she never brought that up to you even after the fact.\n\nShe could have at least mentioned that to you since it is both of your guy's apartment. Just my opinion though.", "NTA. Tara's behavior is absolutely unacceptable and I'm surprised (and concerned) that you went this long without making a bigger deal about it. If your girlfriend does not see how this is a huge issue and sides with her sister, I would seriously contemplate this relationship. Just because she ran away and is having a hard time does not give her a free pass to destroy your belongings and treat you horribly. \n\nYou do not have to do this by any means and it sounds like you've already tried something like this numerous times, but if you want to try and make this relationship work, I would suggest sitting down with your girlfriend and saying how you feel. Say that you cannot put up with her sister treating you the way she has, and you want to have a good relationship with her sister (if you still do at this point, I wouldn't balme you if you don't want that anymore). But Tara needs to meet you halfway. There needs to be a group discussion where you all sit down and talk about boundaries and lay some ground rules. Your apartment can be a safe space for her to come to (if you want it to be), but she also needs to be respectful. You also did not sign up for her practically living with you both, and this situation is not fair to you at all. If nothing changes, if I were you, I would end the relationship immediately. Your girlfriend should be prioritizing your feelings when her sister is clearly in the wrong.", "NTA, Tara is a minor that is skipping school and hanging out in your home.  Your home should not be her safe place during school hours.  She more or less is a runaway that stays at your home.  As Sarah is her sister this is a gray area on the legalities'.  first get a indoor climate control locker and mover your personal belongings there so Tara cannot damage any more of them.  Second start to look for a place of your own.  You did not sign up to house a truant and runaway.", "NTA\u2026your apartment can be a safe place but your girlfriend needs to set ground rules with her sister and the first rule is to show respect for you and your things.  Also did your girlfriend unilaterally decide that the home you share together would be her sisters safe place? Were you aware of this arrangement? \n\nThe fact that your girlfriend has not enforced any rules and coddles her sister speaks volumes. Instead of helping her sister, your girlfriend is just an enabler.  You should feel comfortable in your own home. If Sara wants a safe place for her sister, maybe she should get an apartment on her own and give her sister the freedom to come and go as she wants. You shouldn\u2019t have to put up with this disrespect from both Tara and Sarah.", "NTA\n\nYour GF is the AH - she shouldn\u2019t have made that deal without discussing with you or even informing you. She also should have pulled her up on the disrespect to you and belongings. \n\nBeing a safe space doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t tell them off or rock the boat incase they run away. It means being a safe stable environment which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bunking off school\n\nWith a bit of luck, this will be the cold wet flannel in life that will help Tara come back and build a better relationship where she doesn\u2019t trash vinyl or other peoples homes. On the other hand, you have a GF problem", "NTA. she has no respect for you or your space. if she viewed your apartment as a safe place she would\u2019ve respected the area more.. it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t have a talk with her or Sarah before.", "RUN! Tara is going to hit rock bottom and you will be the blame for \u201ctaking away her safe space\u201d.", "Nta. Your girlfriend is enabling her behavior. Don\u2019t shit in the hand that feeds you. In what world is it okay to trash a home that isn\u2019t yours and ruin items that belong to someone else? NEVER", "NTA. Sounds like your right to think about distancing yourself from Sarah and her sister. All Sarah is doing is just enabling bad behaviour under the guise of helping. If she wants to help her sister then she needs to communicate with her that behaviour needs to change or get the kid some damn therapy or something. By the Sarah realises that her behaviour is making her life worse it\u2019ll be too late. Tara will be living with her and completely dependent on her for everything. Do you want to be apart of something like that for the rest of your life?", "NTA - I would've lost my cool way sooner then you did. Tara needs to learn how the real world works. Allowing her to be disrespectful to others is just facilitating her bad behaviours, her sister needs to realise this as well. If she doesn't change or doesn't genuinely try to then she should not be allowed to stay.", "Nta-this is a crappy situation. Had you known, you may not have added the kicked out part (which while you\u2019re right, but not consulting with GF before giving sister the boot is what got you in trouble here). While you\u2019re okay for kicking someone out that was continuously disrespectful, it was also GF\u2019s place, and her sister, might\u2019ve been better if GF knew before you told sister she\u2019s out (btw-the lecture sounds warranted, but not consulting GF got you in her bad books)", "Kinda an asshole... I think, for the most part, you had valid reasons for getting mad and kicking her out. However, she is only 16, and the parent comment was really mean.  Your girlfriend is TA for allowing this to go on for so long until it blew up and for not informing you  your house was supposed to be her safe space.", "Nobody's the asshole here. But you need to decide whether you are willing and able to play a parental role to Tara, because that's what she's looking for. \n\nIf you want to let Tara stay with you, I would give her her own space, and put away as much of your own stuff as possible so it doesn't get wrecked. Kids going through bad stuff act out, just what they do. If she's trying to run away from home, likely there will be more destruction \n\nIf you don't want to let Tara stay with you, it's perfectly reasonable to limit your contact with her if she can't respect boundaries. But you and Sarah need to decide what those boundaries are. \n\nBut realizing that she's a child, and you'll be raising her to some extent.  If you don't wanna do that, pull the plug on the relationship. People from bad home environments typically look for a \"savior\" in a relationship until they work through their own personal issues.", "INFO - How intense and audiophile are you.

Nevertheless, it needed to be addressed.\n\n\n\nAll the times he spoke to them individually and together and got commitments (and lack of) we're not mature. \n\nHe was to sit on his ass and let the teen \"child\" Destroy his things and disrespect him forever?", "Why is it a bad home? If this is how Tara behaves with her parents she's making it rough on herself.", "Doesn't sound like they were saying that the shelter was a better alternative for them, just that the shelter has those basic rules that have to be followed to use them. And yes. OP's house should have similar rules to be allowed access. Like not turning it into a pig sty. Not eating all OP's food. Not destroying OP's things.  \nShelter's will kick you out for being a complete shit like Tara is being.", "Shelters are HORRIBLE, so why would you ruin a place and destroy someones belongings so that if you want to escape you have to go to a shelter?", "Nah, he should end it with Sarah. Not for being a good sister, but for being a lousy gf who doesn't respect him or his own boundaries. Even if her sister needed a \"safe space,\" she should have COMMUNICATED that to OP. She was using him.", "Rage rooms.", "Clearly not, since she has apparently been happy to let her sister run riot.", "It's not on him to teach her shit. He's not her parent. If she can't behave as a guest she's treated as a vandal. OP could take her to court for damages.", "I respectfully disagree. And I think people on the internet are waaaaay too fast to suggest other people torch their relationships. \n\nBecause people on the internet are also mostly unreasonable and act as though they are literally perfect human beings who make the perfect decisions in their own lives, every single time. Part of that is because self awareness is shockingly uncommon and the other part is that \"pound of flesh\" thing that we are seemingly predisposed to. \n\nI collect vinyl, it's a bonding activity with my daughter. Shit, I even have some relatively high value records myself, so I get where OP is coming from both emotionally and materialistically. This doesn't rise to the level of total emotional upheaval. \n\nAnd you're making an awful lot of assumptions about Sarah not respecting OP. Could she have handled it better? Yeah, absolutely. But I don't believe that it arose out of disrespect or malice. And I don't agree that she was just using him. That doesn't add up for me. And it's clear that because of the toxic environment she grew up in that conflict resolution might be a real hurdle or weak spot for her, to the point that she avoids confrontation. Which is great for preserving the peace but creates a whole new set of problems. \n\nAnd that's the point. Nothing is ever so simple as. And knowing that, as you do, it has to inform how you gauge shit like this, and for me it's certainly not bad enough to go the nuclear option, particularly not if they're otherwise happy. The internet man, it's this false sense of connection and community. \n\nYeah, you can talk to people far away, but you stop treating people with the humanity that you would extend to people if they were in front of you. You start talking with a lot of \"shoulds\" and I find thats a bad business to be in. \n\nLike, imagine dispassionately telling your close friend, who is just venting to you, that you definitely know for sure that his GF doesn't respect him and is using him. You wouldn't do that.", "Seriously? OP should pay to enable his GF's sister's shitty habits? How about the GF teaching the sister not to destroy other's belongings?\n\nAlso I don't think this is about pure blinded rage where she is breaking shit. She is doing this to annoy OP. Rage rooms won't help", "Maybe now she understand her shit has consequences.", "Fuck can we stop using \"underdeveloped brain\" as an excuse to treat 16 year old girls like toddlers?", ">And you're making an awful lot of assumptions about Sarah not respecting OP\n\nShe did NOT tell him about THEIR (both of them, not just hers) home being a safe space. And, blew off his stuff getting destroyed while allowing her sister to treat him like garbage. \n\nHow is this anything but lack of respect to OP? Any one of them would qualify.", "I agree with you to an extent. Ending the relationship with Sarah is extreme. \nBut Sarah isn\u2019t a very good gf right now. She should\u2019ve set boundaries with Tara from day 1. Especially since OP has been repeating himself like a broken record. To me, this seems like Sarah either doesn\u2019t care or isn\u2019t paying attention. I get that Tara is her sister, but Tara needs to respect other people\u2019s property. I agree with someone else on here that said that Tara is doing it on purpose to drive a wedge between OP and Sarah, and it\u2019s working. I just hope Tara\u2019s actions don\u2019t affect OP\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s relationship and they break up over this. It\u2019s manipulative to the extreme and not fair to either OP or Sarah.", "You're missing the point. I recommended it as a team building activity where the parties involved also get to enjoy a little bit of cathartic destruction. As an ironic punctuation of the event as it concludes with people coming closer together instead of breaking up. \n\nEither the couple breaks up over it, or they don't. If the teenager is trying to drive a wedge, as I also said, then breaking up is actually giving her what she wants. Which is her sisters undivided attention.  I suspect this is the case because of the home environment. \n\nOr OP can set the actual example for healthy conflict resolution with the people that he cares about, show the teenager he's not going to be wedged out and extend the olive branch to proceed under this new dynamic of mutual respect. \n\nOP has no shortage of people telling him to nuke the relationship...they never do...but it's okay to give him a perspective where maybe people grow a little too.", "Making bad decisions or making a mistake isn't the same thing as not respecting someone. \n\nBut this was my mistake, I keep doing this and being baffled when I'm met with downvotes. \n\nYou guys are right, everyone makes every mistake out of malice and no one should ever be forgiven nor any issue ever resolved with anything but the most extreme option. Amen."]}
