It seems like your post is incomplete", "Nta no harm no foul", "My husband is a tattooist, yes it is generally considered very bad etiquette to get a tattoo finished by a different artist, but considering you have completely left that country it\u2019s not unreasonable to do in this case. You also didn\u2019t make any attempt to recover the deposit you left him. And he sounds like a creep if he thought it appropriate to call you out when he was scrolling through the past 6 months of your insta posts.", "NTA. He doesn't own the body part where you had the tattoo done. He doesn't own the tattoo either. You paid him for his time and in exchange you own your tattoo. He should've returned your deposit too.", "NTA. You are a customer of the tattoo artist. You aren't obligated to continue to use him, especially if you have moved and the location is no longer convenient for where you live.", "NTA and the guy is complaining he got money for work he's no longer expected to do?\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect you to travel just to soothe his ego.", "NTA. You moved. That simple", "NTA. Some tattoo artists take themselves way too seriously.", "I googled it, and you can easily block instagram followers *without them even knowing it*. I would go ahead and do that.\n\nThis guy isn\u2019t your friend and you will probably never see him in person again. And why would you even want to. NTA", "The other tattoo artist is a child. What are you going to do, fly back just to fill in a tattoo or never complete it?", "NTA - your skin - your money. No need to justify.", "NTA you let someone else finish your tattoo because you moved. Thats a normal thing and can happen. Also a lot of tattoo artist are whiny af about their art. In the end it is a service, not more not less. Just like a mechanic wouldnt be mad if you moved and someone else finished their job.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume he kept the deposit so it's not like he's out any money, so it's probably a hurt ego issue", "NTA\n\nYou dont live there or even remotely close. If you want it finished,  its best to get one within your area.", "Info - how does that first artist even know?", "NTA. Even if you lived a town over, NTA.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t something you actively chose to do because of issues with the artist, it would have made no sense for you to fly back only to get it down by the original artist.", "NTA for a few reasons including the length of time you waited, the circumstances, and the geography.  What nailed the NTA for me was the fact that the design wasn\u2019t an original design.  I have some highly original work where I essentially gave the artist some inspiration and said draw whatever you want.  I think if I got it shaded by someone else without checking in with the original artist, that would be more problematic.  I think you\u2019re in the clear", "Looking though my insta photos from 6 months ago haha. I didn't post it or anything. There are just a couple of photos of me at the beach on there that you can see it colored in compared to 4 years ago when it wasn't.", "We follow each other on insta and he has liked my posts/stories ab me moving to Europe 2 years ago when I moved. I got this done 6 months ago and he JUST messaged me ab it a week ago. I didn't bother replying. He knows I don't live there.", "Get their permission??? What would that change anyway? Nobody needs permission from another human being to move somewhere and get work done by someone else.", "Only way is scrolling my insta. I didn't even post the finished job. I have some photos of me at the beach from like 6 months ago around when I got it done. Like casually chillin.", "Wow that's obsessive", "I should add it isn't a design that he himself drew. It is something that already exists (anime related) and he just did the linework so idk why he's trippin' tbf haha", "In that case, 100% NTA", "NTA\n\nHe got paid,and it's your tattoo.  Both of my tattoos have been worked on by two different people.  My designs,nobody had an issue with it.", "Nta", "NTA but\n\nFor next time you might consider reaching out to the original tattooist first, explain that you're unlikely to every be in country again to see him, and ask if he can recommend someone that might be right to complete the work in your new local area.\n\nJust a thought - if I was in their shoes I'd respond a lot more favourably to that sort of a question.", "NTA\n\nWhat, did he expect to post it in?  Can you colour them by email now?", "Nta- your body your choice", "Not in my experience.\n\nMy design, my skin.", "If they said no, would op just have to have an unfinished tattoo for the rest of his life?", "I live in such a small country 90% of people from where Im from don't know it exists haha but good advice.", "I mean, good for you, but most of the tattooists I know do consider it bad etiquette. Not to the point where they\u2019d kick off with the customer about it, and obviously if the customer had had a bad experience they\u2019d be understanding, but it\u2019s just a bit of an unwritten rule. \n\nIt\u2019s like if someone went to a cake maker, asked them to make them a cake, but you\u2019re gonna get it decorated somewhere else. Yeah sure it\u2019s your cake and it\u2019s your money and some bakers would be ok with that, but it\u2019s still poor etiquette.", "Like I said, you\u2019d just go ahead and have it touched up my another artist and piss off the original artist", "I thought it was more because some tatooists get attached to \"their art\" and they had certain pride in \"their design\". \nSo it's like getting another artist to finish a painting mid-commission after the original artist did like all the designing and laid out the baseworks.\n\nHowever, you'd think a reasonable person would of been understanding of OPs circumstances.  For me the stalking on Insta really pushes it into creep territory rather than artwork pride.", "None of the tattooists I know think that.   And I know a lot of the local artists.\n\nDon't get me wrong - there are definitely some times where I can see it actually being rude, like when it's a big elaborate design you are personally invested in, and have done most of teh work on.  \"Sharing Credit\" with some dude that coloured in the eyes would piss me off, too.\n\nI mean, I don't get pissy when some tattooist is getting credit for putting my art on somebody.   Long story - Did a really nice drawing of my roommate for her birthday.  She was a dancer, gave a copy of it to a favourite customer.\n\nCustomer went and had it tattooed on his arm.  Looks awesome, btw.  Me?  No worries.\n\nIt actually gets funnier/weirder, tattooist used to date roommate, recognized her, and my drawing style, and told us about it.", "That is definitely a better analogy \ud83d\ude05\n\nYeah 100%. The dudes a wrong \u2018un.", "All of the ones I know do, maybe it\u2019s a regional thing!", "Customers not returning is the purpose of paying deposits.\n\nNTA, and hes a major creep too for finding it by stalking your insta page and sending you a weird dm, so you dodged a bullet", "NTA its like your dentist getting pissed because you went to another dentist after moving, dont worry about it just tell them the reason and if they cant understand that then eh... you did your best", "What in the world ?!? That's a bit creepy IMO ! NTA", "~Were they banking on getting more money from you (and other unfinished clients work) if they ever moved back? Because that's the exact vibe it gives off. Fuck that noise. ~     \n      \n~If they were so keen to finish the piece they should have got it done before indefinitely leaving.~ edited because clearly daytime drinking and reading do not mesh well together.        \n            \nPay them no mind, and definitely don't pay them anymore money", "wow he must be desperate for work, which is kind of a bad sign because at least where i\u2019m at most halfway decent artists are booked up for several months. NTA, that\u2019s ridiculous and unprofessional", "The artist didn't leave the country, op did. Still nta tho", "Then why bother getting permission in the first place?", "This is accurate of all the tattooists I know as well, and they\u2019re all over the country so definitely not regional. Some people just care about things and others don\u2019t, but industry etiquette is that you continue to go to the same person for the same piece unless you have good reason not to (like moving to another country, in OP\u2019s case)."]}
