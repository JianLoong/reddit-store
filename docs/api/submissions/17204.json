Yeah sure it\u2019s your cake and it\u2019s your money and some bakers would be ok with that, but it\u2019s still poor etiquette.", "Like I said, you\u2019d just go ahead and have it touched up my another artist and piss off the original artist", "I thought it was more because some tatooists get attached to \"their art\" and they had certain pride in \"their design\". \nSo it's like getting another artist to finish a painting mid-commission after the original artist did like all the designing and laid out the baseworks.\n\nHowever, you'd think a reasonable person would of been understanding of OPs circumstances.  For me the stalking on Insta really pushes it into creep territory rather than artwork pride.", "None of the tattooists I know think that.   And I know a lot of the local artists.\n\nDon't get me wrong - there are definitely some times where I can see it actually being rude, like when it's a big elaborate design you are personally invested in, and have done most of teh work on.  \"Sharing Credit\" with some dude that coloured in the eyes would piss me off, too.\n\nI mean, I don't get pissy when some tattooist is getting credit for putting my art on somebody.   Long story - Did a really nice drawing of my roommate for her birthday.  She was a dancer, gave a copy of it to a favourite customer.\n\nCustomer went and had it tattooed on his arm.  Looks awesome, btw.  Me?  No worries.\n\nIt actually gets funnier/weirder, tattooist used to date roommate, recognized her, and my drawing style, and told us about it.", "That is definitely a better analogy \ud83d\ude05\n\nYeah 100%.

I actually had a similar situation, moving from Central Europe to Northern Europe. I didn't get an old tattoo finished, but just found a new artist for me in the country that I live in now. \n\nMy old tattoo artist saw a tattoo that my new one did on my Facebook. At first I thought \"omfg now, pls no drama\", but he actually likes my new artist's work and is glad I found a good one in my new country as well.\n\nYour old tattoo artist has an ego problem at best and is an obsessive creep at worst. If geographics don't play along, no can do and among many reasons, that is definitely one to change your artist and get a tattoo finished by another one.", "NTA\n\n\n\nMoving to another country or not, your body, your money, your choice.", "Just remember this. IT\"S YOUR BODY NTA", "[deleted]", "Normally, yes, you would be. But in this case there are circumstances that definitely make you NTA.

He doesn't own any of your skin, and the fact he's upset rather than pleased you got it finished is red flags. If one of my clients moved I'd in no way expect them to fly all the way back just to finish it.

Evidently they found my using their wording to expand the point too much of a blow to the ego to bear. They blocked me and reported that I was in danger of self-harm or suicide.

I personally want my tattoo artists to feel invested in and proud of their pieces.", "It was okay at most. He was just starting out when i went to him and some of the lines were a little shit but I was doing him a favor as a friend by going to him. Not for his portfolio but for the money.", "Wow! What a stalker!", "That's so creepy. I have a lot of lt clients on social media, they all become friends in a weird way after so long and it's nice. But I'd never stalk them, that's so creepy. Your previous artist sounds like red flag city.", "But its not just your design, the design is a collaboration between you and your artist.", "Well i want my plumber to be invested aswell... Otherweise it will be a shitty day.", "I'm super curious about this! One of my artists started a tattoo and has not responded to my messages asking when we can finish it (the stencil kept getting wiped off because of position and them being left handed and they weren't comfortable freehanding so we mutually decided to reconvene another day as I had plans later and they were tired(I also did pay already)). Would it still be seen as bad ettiquite if I find another artist to finish it? Id let them make it their own so it wouldn't be the same design, I just also really hate that its unfinished, and the person won't respond to my messages now.", "But it also sounds like OP never communicated his circumstances to the artist, so how could he be understanding of it?", "I wanted a tattoo from one artist to be filled in by a second, but the first had on their website specifically \"don't take my work somewhere else to be finished\". So I'm looking elsewhere now", "Sounds like they never even asked or questioned why OP they changed tatoo artists.\nBut went straight to anger and taking it personal.\n\nYou'd think at least be like \"Hey, noticed you got the tatoo finished by someone else.  Any reason you didn't come back?\"\n\nAfter reading ops further comments, it wasn't even an original design. So why the tatooists took it so personal is a bit weird.", "Absolutely NTH. Tattoo artist here. It\u2019s YOUR tattoo.  My industry is unfortunately flooded with self-righteous narcissists who believe they have ownership over their client\u2019s bodies. It is ALWAYS your right to decide exactly who you want to get tattooed by. You have no obligation towards this artist. It\u2019s also hilarious that they threatened to never tattoo you again even though you permanently left the country.", "NTA but I\u2019m surprised another artist was willing to finish it. I have a grayscale one that I have had trouble getting done because no one wants to touch someone else\u2019s art even though the artist moved back to his home state. You have a great excuse being so far away so definitely NTA here and even if you were closer, it\u2019s your body you can go to whomever you want.", "NTA. Ideally you stick with the same artist through completion, but valid reasons for switching it out include geographic distance. The tattooist has unreasonable expectations.", "Lol NTA. The audacity that some of these tattoo artists have is astounding.", "Ultimately NTA, but you should have given them a heads up that you aren't planning on ever going there to finish it up and will be looking for someone local to do it. It does suck seeing something you worked on and then being blindsided with the whole they took it to someone else to finish. I understand they didn't create the art itself, but they still did all of that line work. But they should also understand you were nice and didn't take back the deposit and that you are too far to get it finished by them. Also they are weird for looking through your posts like that.", "NTA. Tattooist here. He\u2019s a child. I\u2019ve had this happen more than once (because a lot of my clients are active duty) and I provided my sketch and color studies to the other artist (when asked) so they could get it right or tweak it to their preference. It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about the art and experience.", "I\u2019ve never been a fan of this reasoning for \u201ctattoo etiquette\u201d. I\u2019ve been tattooing for 15 years and it is absolutely up to the client to finish their tattoo with someone else. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not my body, it\u2019s not my tattoo. When I was starting out my career and was desperate for work something like that would have bummed me out but I still don\u2019t have the right to claim any kind of ownership over a tattoo on someone else\u2019s body, even if I started it. I don\u2019t own the tattoo, they bought it from me already. It\u2019s theirs.", "That's really creepy.", "You should tell him to kick rocks and I wouldve let everyone else on his insta page know what kind of creep he is", "I should add it isn't a design that he himself drew.", "Agreed in general, but distance definitely impacts it. I needed some minor adjustments done to one of my tattoos, and I had moved across the country from the original artist. Not going to pay for a flight just to get some touch up work done. When I talked to a local artist, I explained the situation and he had no issue with it. He was a bit skeptical to start with, but once I said that the artist was 1k+ miles away, he said it would be silly to make that trip just for some minor work.", "Naw, not mine, dude.   I came up with both designs, drew and inked them oversized to be shrunk to the stencil size.   They just put the ink down.\n\nDon't get me wrong, they were all very good at their job, or I wouldn't have gone to them.\n\nBut - dude, I'm an artist and designer.  I'm not wearing somebody else's artwork, sorry.", "Ego.", "Love this analogy. I\u2019m a tattooer and I compare our occupation to plumbing all the time. Obviously I take pride in my work, I hold myself to a high standard, and I\u2019m always going to do the best job I possibly can. But at the end of the day it\u2019s still a service. It ain\u2019t about me.", "Even worse. I could understand being dissapointed you didn't get the chance to finish a piece of art you created custom for a client (but not angry like the guy) but acting like that when you didn't even design it? Jeeez.", "Not bad etiquette. You\u2019re giving the original artist an opportunity to finish their work and they\u2019re dropping the ball. Some of the best advice I received during my apprenticeship: \u201cif they aren\u2019t coming back to you, you only have yourself to blame.\u201d", "If they aren't responding to communications then you aren't obligated to stay with them. It's not just art, it's a business. If your tattooist can't even reply to messages then you can move on guilt free. \n\nI'm sure there are still people that thing it's bad etiquette, but it goes both ways.", "Thank you for your response! Ive been really torn on how to proceed and this helps me a lot!", "Thank you! Its nice to hear other people saythat I can move on! It will be great to finally get this piece done!", "Happy to help! Also important to note that \u201cnot wiping off the stencil\u201d is like first-year 101 stuff. You learn how to anchor that stencil asap, and your handedness makes no difference. If they don\u2019t feel confident because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll wipe the stencil off AND they say they\u2019re too tired to continue AND they asked you to pay in advance I would say those are red flags and it\u2019s best you don\u2019t go back to them anyway.  It doesn\u2019t sound like they were respecting the weight of the trust required to permanently alter another person\u2019s body.  Tattooers at times are really good at not giving the full truth to people in order to hide their own insecurities about their abilities, and tattooing has been guarded for so long that the general public doesn\u2019t really know how the process should play out.", "Hahaha I do agree on all that and for most of my tattoos I go to people that do do all those things. In this case its a friend that is learning how to tattoo. We were close in high school and they do art for a living so I will occasionally buy whatever merch they have on their etsy shop and they recently posted an idea for a tattoo design that I actually really liked so reached out to them. It's sad but it is what it is.", "Not just art and business - it's also a matter of bodily autonomy. A client shouldn't have to exist forever with a half-finished piece on themselves.", "I got mine done in three sessions over a 6 month period. Our start date was set back a couple times due to illness and travel on their part, but she was always communicative. If she had been unable to finish for some reason, I'd have gone elsewhere because I'm not walking around with a half done tattoo indefinitely."]}
