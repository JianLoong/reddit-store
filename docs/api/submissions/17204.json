It seems like your post is incomplete", "Nta no harm no foul", "My husband is a tattooist, yes it is generally considered very bad etiquette to get a tattoo finished by a different artist, but considering you have completely left that country it\u2019s not unreasonable to do in this case. You also didn\u2019t make any attempt to recover the deposit you left him. And he sounds like a creep if he thought it appropriate to call you out when he was scrolling through the past 6 months of your insta posts.", "NTA. He doesn't own the body part where you had the tattoo done. He doesn't own the tattoo either. You paid him for his time and in exchange you own your tattoo. He should've returned your deposit too.", "NTA. You are a customer of the tattoo artist. You aren't obligated to continue to use him, especially if you have moved and the location is no longer convenient for where you live.", "NTA and the guy is complaining he got money for work he's no longer expected to do?\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect you to travel just to soothe his ego.", "NTA. You moved. That simple", "NTA. Some tattoo artists take themselves way too seriously.", "I googled it, and you can easily block instagram followers *without them even knowing it*. I would go ahead and do that.\n\nThis guy isn\u2019t your friend and you will probably never see him in person again. And why would you even want to. NTA", "The other tattoo artist is a child. What are you going to do, fly back just to fill in a tattoo or never complete it?", "NTA - your skin - your money. No need to justify.", "NTA you let someone else finish your tattoo because you moved. Thats a normal thing and can happen. Also a lot of tattoo artist are whiny af about their art. In the end it is a service, not more not less. Just like a mechanic wouldnt be mad if you moved and someone else finished their job.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume he kept the deposit so it's not like he's out any money, so it's probably a hurt ego issue", "NTA\n\nYou dont live there or even remotely close. If you want it finished,  its best to get one within your area.", "Info - how does that first artist even know?", "NTA. Even if you lived a town over, NTA.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t something you actively chose to do because of issues with the artist, it would have made no sense for you to fly back only to get it down by the original artist.", "NTA for a few reasons including the length of time you waited, the circumstances, and the geography.  What nailed the NTA for me was the fact that the design wasn\u2019t an original design.  I have some highly original work where I essentially gave the artist some inspiration and said draw whatever you want.  I think if I got it shaded by someone else without checking in with the original artist, that would be more problematic.  I think you\u2019re in the clear", "Looking though my insta photos from 6 months ago haha. I didn't post it or anything. There are just a couple of photos of me at the beach on there that you can see it colored in compared to 4 years ago when it wasn't.", "We follow each other on insta and he has liked my posts/stories ab me moving to Europe 2 years ago when I moved. I got this done 6 months ago and he JUST messaged me ab it a week ago. I didn't bother replying. He knows I don't live there.", "Get their permission??? What would that change anyway? Nobody needs permission from another human being to move somewhere and get work done by someone else.", "Only way is scrolling my insta. I didn't even post the finished job. I have some photos of me at the beach from like 6 months ago around when I got it done. Like casually chillin.", "Wow that's obsessive", "I should add it isn't a design that he himself drew. It is something that already exists (anime related) and he just did the linework so idk why he's trippin' tbf haha", "In that case, 100% NTA"]}
