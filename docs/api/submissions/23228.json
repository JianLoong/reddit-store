About 2 weeks ago fianc\u00e9s mother (51f) came over to our house for coffee and to visit fianc\u00e9, they are very close due to him being an only child so this isn\u2019t weird plus his parents live about 6 houses down from us. Well about 5 mins into the visit FMIL turns to fianc\u00e9 and asks \u201cHas Jessica lost any weight?\u201d Side note I am a 5 foot tall curvy woman. My fianc\u00e9 was shocked and said \u201c I don\u2019t know I haven\u2019t asked why?\u201d She said \u201c Because I always pictured you with a princess or mermaid. You know someone taller and thinner. I just feel bad I didn\u2019t say something sooner and intervened in the relationship before it got this far.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 said he was shocked after that and didn\u2019t know to say other than \u201cwhat the fuck.\u201d His mother left after that and my fianc\u00e9 told me what happened when I got home. I obviously was devastated. His mother and I had an amazing relationship before this and were extremely close. They dont have a lot of family here in the US due to them immigrating from another country and she has a hard time speaking English so I always tried to include her in things my fianc\u00e9 and I were doing so she wasn\u2019t alone when her husband worked weekends. I tried to learn their native language so she could feel more comfortable communicating with me. I tried so hard to be the best daughter in law. And now I feel like it was all fake on her part. And that her I love you\u2019s which she always said mean nothing. The following day we had her over to \u201cexplain\u201d her side but she just doubled down and said it to my face and that she is \u201cso relieved to tell me this, that it\u2019s a huge weight off her shoulders, and I hope this doesn\u2019t change our relationship. \u201d I cried and my fianc\u00e9 told her to leave, I have not directly spoken to her since and my fianc\u00e9 is starting to say that I\u2019m kind of being an ahole because I won\u2019t even speak to her to accept her apology.

Now is the time to start planning how you're going to keep your distance from her.\n\nEdit: I've just had a cynical thought. There's no way she didn't know how much her words hurt you, and made you uncomfortable.... but maybe that's what she wants. Maybe she's hoping that you'll be so uncomfortable with the idea of her as a mother in law, that you'll reconsider the wedding. She already said that she wishes the two of you had broken up, maybe this is her last ditch attempt.", "So your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother called you short, fat, and not good enough for her son. \n\nHer son decided that instead of dealing with his mother like an adult and leaving you out of the situation until he found some resolution with her, he would instead tell you that she called you short, fat, and not good enough for her son. And then he invited her over to say it all to your face.\n\nAnd when you end up upset over being called short, fat, and not good enough for her son, her son decides that you must be an asshole.\n\nUm\u2026why are you with this guy? NTA", "WTF?? Just because she \u201capologized\u201d that she said it doesn\u2019t mean that (1) she means it and (2) that you need to accept it!! What she said was very hurtful, disgusting, disrespectful, cruel and insensitive!! Your fianc\u00e9 would be the AH if he continues to push for you to accept an apology that she didn\u2019t mean and that you don\u2019t want to accept. But know that this will affect you relationship. I think some pre-marital counseling could help!", "INFO: did she just watch the little mermaid movie? is she \u2018all there\u2019?", "NTA. But both your fianc\u00e9 and FMIL are. You might want to reconsider marriage if this is how he intends to deal with conflict from his family.

What she looks like is the least thing she should be concerned with. \n\nRegardless of whether you accept her apology or not (and I will bet the \"apology\" is less-than-apologetic), her \"relief\" has come at the cost of your relationship. You can never look at her the same again. I was in the same boat with my MIL (who lived in a different country - her funeral was today). She was mad that her son, her ONLY child, moved halfway around to world to be with a \"terrible American\". She never said such things to my face - she was, after all, a well-bred English lady. But she never held back to her son. It was six years into our marriage before she quit trying to encourage him to \"come to his senses and move home.\" But she was always exceedingly passive-aggressive with me. \n\nAccepting an apology isn't the same thing as forgetting what happened. She set the tone for the relationship. She has to live with the consequences.", "I'd be interested to know if MILs native culture does _not_ view statements about weight and appearance with the same taboos as typical American culture(s).

He might be using this conflict as a way out of the engagement. Think about what he just did:\n\n1. Let his mother talk ill of you without shutting it down\n2.

Allowed you and your mum to escalate the conflict,\n4. Started victim blaming you.\n\nIf you refuse to apologise, he might use this as a tool to walk away.\n\nIf you apologise, he'll use the \"I'm settling for someone below my standard\" bullshit story his mum fed him throughout your relationship.\n\nReally reconsider marrying this guy.", "Nta, just because someone apologizes doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept. It takes time.\n\nAsk your fiance how long would he move on if you told him he was fat and apologized.", "Wow! Then again, you probably wished for a kind and intelligent MIL. I'm sorry you didn't get one.", "NTA. Tell her she isn\u2019t the type of MIL you pictured for yourself. That you always pictured your future MIL to be a nice person and one that you wanted to spend time with. But unfortunately you ended up with her instead.", "NTA What a nasty woman! And your fianc\u00e9, seriously... If you had said the same to her, that you wanted her to lose weight, do you think he would be urging her to accept a fake apology or \"smooth things over\". \n\nDon't marry this man until you're absolutely certain he's 100% on your side and has your back. With a mil like that you need someone who stands up for you, otherwise the rest of your marriage will be tough. Especially if you have children.", "NTA.

She says the same to me. \n\nSo for her to casually announce to us that I am too short and fat to marry her son, and wow how great it is to finally tell me that, and I learn that she wishes she had gotten rid of me before our relationship became serious. \n\nAnd now you think I am taking too long to accept her apology?\n\nI don't plan to accept it until those words are true. Right now, they aren't. I feel hurt, humiliated, and angry, and it is because she lied to my face and then stabbed me in the back. I don't know how or when this gets fixed, because I don't want anything to do with your mother at the moment.\"", "NTA - but- if you want your relationship to work out, there will need to be some forgiveness on your end since it is his mother and he\u2019s obviously very close to her.

Her behavior would be completely normal and expected in their society. \n\nAs it sounds, when MIL came back over to explain herself, she felt relieved to be honest and perhaps was trying to point out that she did still love OP, and it may have been very strange for her to get over the customs she's used to in her own country.

Id never speak about anyone like that but maybe shed some light on this from another perspective. I\u2019m also a curvy woman and i have a lot of trauma from a lifetime of being told things like that cause I\u2019m also from a culture that does that. Outside the US, a lot of cultures are like that. The elders tell you to lose weight. They comment on your appearance. Its usually blunt and with no regard for your feelings. When you are hurt, they ask, \u201cwhy? Do you want me to lie to you? It\u2019s the truth! Lose weight and it will be better for you! Don\u2019t eat those. You\u2019re looking like a pig or a cow.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of toxic skinny culture stuff going on lol but also I feel like this culture of eating and empowering fat people is just not something that most countries do. I\u2019m also fat and in the same boat as you so please don\u2019t think of that as an attack. Many are jumping on the boat to slam MIL but there is also a culture clash at play here. Long story short, I don\u2019t feel like my family says these things to me cause they don\u2019t love me. Many times I\u2019ve cried and my mom told me she just didn\u2019t want me to have a hard life or get bullied. The reality is, skinny people just have an easier time. She thought of it as encouraging me even though she was blunt and mean about it lol. That\u2019s another thing though. Immigrants don\u2019t sugarcoat things. They don\u2019t see a point in it. Life has made them hard and cold about certain emotional things. My mom got so used to being alone and struggling alone in a country where she knew no one and had no one that she stopped feeling sad about a lot of things. She toughened up in order to get through it all. Now NOTHING upsets her. A handyman came over to our house. He was racist to her and refused to do the work. He screamed and cursed in her face and stormed out. She didn\u2019t allow herself to be upset about it. So for her, she doesn\u2019t get why I\u2019m upset about her calling me fat, when I am fat.

It is not uncommon to hear some criticism from your mom about your fianc\u00e9 or spouse (though this one is extreme and strange).
