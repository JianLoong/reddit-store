It's ingrained in him. You're young, have your entire life ahead of you, and havent experienced a healthy relationship yet. A relationship is supposed to make your life easier, not harder.

But your brother was ok with his friend not paying you rent or bills, tries to guilt you for standing up to him, tries to say YOU'LL be responsible if he relapses even though he's responsible for himself as an adult - and now you're guilting YOURSELF worrying your older, adult brother might relapse because his friend is 'a bad influence'?\n\nMy god. You said they both took care of you, but honestly it seems like they molded you into being their mother-substitute, like they convinced you it's your duty to work for their benefit and protect them from adult responsibility for their own lives.

BF is not an asshole for not paying rent, as the OP has apparently never asked him to, and by her own account on at least one occasion that he offered to pay rent, she declined and verbally attacked him.\n\nOP is an asshole for not charging this guy any rent and then using this choice of hers against him in an argument, and not even accepting his offer to pay rent and instead decline and then once again use the fact he's not paying rent to belittle and insult him. It sounds like OP doesn't want her BF to pay rent because she wants to be in total control and feel superior to her \"freeloader, couch surfer\" BF.\n\nAnd no OP, you don't get to retroactively charge people rent. That's not how any of this works.", "NTA. Your brother wasn\u2019t present for the argument. To be honest, you\u2019ll probably never see a penny of the past rent, but cutting this off now will save you tons of money and stress in the future. Good luck in medical school : )", "NTA. He\u2019s a miser and a jealous control freak. Better off without him. You do you, get your medical degree and live your life how you want it.", "NTA.

NTA", "ESH - Boyfriend is obviously an asshole and you should dump him, but you're also an asshole for retroactively demanding rent. It's reasonable to start charging rent, but to retroactively charge rent isn't. You let him live there for free, that's on you. In hindsight, the smart thing to do was to start charging rent when he started making money.", "NTA he\u2019s gross and awful for what he said. But you\u2019re going to have a hard time getting two years of back rent.", "NTA honey, dump him. Really. Let him live with your brother. They love each other.  You have a life to live and make the world a better place!", "Jesus Christ you and this creep started dating when you were 15 and he was 18? That\u2019s not okay. NTA", "This. OP, it feels a little like you're trapped in a relationship just because you were with this man during your younger years, and during trauma, and because your brother gets involved. Sit back and decide if you'd be relieved to not be with your BF any longer. If you would be, take your brother out for lunch and don't give reasons or excuses. Tell him the relationship has run it's course. That you're in different places now, and that you'd rather end things before you hate each other. Tell him you don't want him to try to change your mind because you won't, but that he can be there when you break it to the BF, or just come in after you're done talking. (Since they're saying your BF is so unstable that you HAVE to stay with him and never critique him or he'll relapse. Which is just, sigh.) End it with your BF. Get him out of your place. Get distance from him. And try to create a new relationship with your brother outside of this man.", "NTA.

He didn\u2019t care about your comfort with that male customer as if the customer was flirting with you - he immediately made YOU the bad guy.

Please go no contact with him soon. The sooner the better.", "NTA.  If he does, that's on him.  What did you say that isn't true.  He is a freeloader, he doesn't pay rent.
