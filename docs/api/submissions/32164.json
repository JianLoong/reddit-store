It would be that \"if any other guest who is older than me comes, and does not have a seat, I must give them my seat at the table and spend the night standing\". It is important to notice that the party includes dinner, so I would have to, most likely, stand while everyone is eating and chatting.\n\nThe reason for this whole issue is that my cousin only booked for 50 seats, but will have more than 50 guests, and me being a last time guest, would have to be under those conditions.\n\nThe first thing I tols my mom when she told me that, was that I wasn't going, but she might need some help to keep an eye on my dad for some out of context circumstances related to medical issues that doesn't allow him to fluently comunicate. \n\nAfter listening to that I said that I would think about going, but that if I had to spend the night standing because of someone else wanting my seat, I would be leaving in the spot, calling a taxi and going back home without saying a word to anyone.\n\nMy mom said that it would be rude to do it, and disrespectful, and in case I'm thinking on doing that, I shouldn't go\n\nMy question is, would I be the A hole if I did that?

It's not your fault your cousin can't count and over invited. When you extend and invite to someone and they attend, YOU are THEIR guest. Therefore etiquette demands THEY ensure YOUR comfort. \n\nIt's monumentally disrespectful to force a guest to stand against a wall with a plate of food while watching everyone else have a lovely dinner. I would personally feel so uncomfortable if I saw this situation unfold and would seriously call out the host. It's one thing to voluntarily give up your sheet, it's another to force someone to give up their seat because in your mind a younger adult is still a child.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your mom only wants you there so she can fob your dad off on you while she parties the night away.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t go at all.  Those are ridiculous conditions that you have to agree to.", "NTA. \n\nThey can't invite you to a party last minute and then expect you to give up your seat for the ENTIRE night. You're not the host. It's not your duty or obligation to ensure everyone's comfort. If the hosts\u00a0are expecting more than 50 guests, they should book more than 50 seats.", "NTA\n\nIf you are invited as family, you are expected to have a seat at the table", "NTA It's rude to have these conditions. You would be reacting to rudeness.\n\nThe only reason I would go would be to help out with your dad -- but in those circumstances I would have the cousin make you an exception to the \"give up your seat\" rule as you'd be there to aid your father. If your cousin can't agree to that, don't go as your cousin would be being doubly rude. Then if you get any flak for not going you could straight up tell people that you were going to go to help your dad but your cousin wouldn't agree to guaranteeing you a seat beside your dad to allow you to do that. Let the blowback fall on your cousin where it belongs.", "nta. it is rude (disrespectful, even) to expect you to stand while others sit, and given this condition i think it\u2019s fair to view this invitation as insincere and just not go. mom can ask a guest who is not expected to stand all night to help her keep an eye on dad, or they, too, can stay home. keep in mind it\u2019s better not to go than leave in the middle.\n\neta: if anyone asks you about it just say you were told there wasn\u2019t a seat for you.", "Surely the restaurant would not allow a customer to stand and eat?\n\nIf there are 50 guests, I assume the cousin has booked the whole venue?", "NTA.

I swear these older people need to learn some manners.\n\nJust don't go.", "NTA. It's more rude to ask a guest to stand. Your aunt should not be inviting over 50 people when she only booked for 50. Everyone here is rude except you my dear. I would just not go just in case.", "NTA. If I were in your place, I wouldn't go. This scenario sounds like you are kind of tolerated to be there, but are definitely less than a person. As soon as a \"true\" guest wants your seat, you need to relinquish your comfort immediately, because clearly your needs are not important.\n\nNope. I'd have more self-worth and dignity than those people have basic human decency. Do whatever feels right, OP, but this devaluing setup does not feel right to me.\n\nYou know the saying \"You teach people how to treat you\"?

Don't go, you're mum will have to recruit another family member to help with her husband, because it's clear you're not actyally invited by your cousin, but merely there to help your mum, and it's not reasonable to expect guests to stand.

Just don't go", "NTA. And what\u2019s wrong with your stupid mom? If you are there as a guest plus she needs your help she should be insisting that you keep your seat.

I know in my culture, it would come across as rude if a young person is seen sitting down when there are older people standing around (unless they have a reason- disabled, injured etc).

Just save yourself the hassle.", "NTA. If I were you I wouldn't go. Aside from having to stand uncomfortably or whatever, it's going to be a mess.

I would just save myself the hassle.", "NTA. Who the fuck invites over 50 guests when there is only 50 seats for a dinner party. \n\nI also think it's rude to make the younger adults give up their seats if someone older comes (exceptions for like really old people). Maybe they should have come earlier.", "It's rude to expect others to accommodate her for her lack of planning when inviting more guests than the number of seats she reserved. On top of that, those who are expected to give up their seats will have to stand the whole night and watch the others eat and drink, just because they're older. If your mom is also going, she can watch your dad. Being older is no excuse for AH behaviour.

Save the gift money and live your own life.", "NTA You\u2019ve been invited to a meal in a restaurant and told you won\u2019t have a seat at the table unless there is a no show by someone? Are you expected to hover alongside the table while the actual guests tuck in? Or will you be standing in the corner or another part of the restaurant? Will you even be fed? The rudeness of expecting anyone to go along with that is shocking! Will the waiter or waitress have to work around you while carrying plates of food? If I were you, I would spend the evening with your Dad and let your Mum go alone and enjoy herself.", "INFO: Mom told you the condition and you said that you'd rather not go.. but, she then coerced you to go because she needs help with your dad, but now she's saying if you plan to leave if you have to give up your seat, then you should stay home???\n\nIf this is correct, then you're NTA because you originally said you didn't want to go when you heard the conditions. As a disabled person, I am sympathetic to your dad, but also, I assume that the family knows your father's condition to the point of understanding that he requires some accommodations.", "Fuck this. Don't go. Ain't nobody got time for this kind of rubbish. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's been made painfully clear to you that you're a second-class guest, which is incredibly rude to you to begin with. I understand why you might want to make excuses to keep the peace and I won't judge you for doing that. But you would also not be the asshole if you just said flat out that your invitation seems grudging, and you are not being treated like someone your cousin actually wants to be there, so you have a long list of things you would rather be doing that evening than standing awkwardly against a wall.", "NTA.

I hope she does not expect gifts.", "NTA, you didn't ask them to invite you, but they did, so it's their job to provide SEATING ON A RESTAURANT.  And why would you book fifty seats when you know your guest limit is over that?", "NTA The restaurant can refuse to serve anyone who is not seated at a table. Where do you put your drink?

Old people, for sure", "YTA:\n\nIf a venue is making space for a party of 50, they will be able to find an extra seat and squeeze you in.\n\nAlso, you seem to have a gripe about being treated as a child at 21, whilst you are acting like a spoilt teenager.", "Shew be less petty YTA", "Can you bring your own folding/ camp chair so you at least don\u2019t have to stand through an entire reception?", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA.

I feel for the dad. Being stuck in a shit show like this with a communication disability.", "I don't believe the issue here is common courtesy. OP Sounds like a perfectly well mannered person, who would probably give up his seat on a bus to an older person, etc. The situation is a sit down dinner party In a restaurant that is expecting 50 people, while more than that have been invited, and telling a young person that they will have to give up their seat if an older person turns up after all 50 seats have been filled, and who will then have to stand throughout the evening. \n\nI can't think of anyone, no matter their age, who would be comfortable attending knowing that they might have to give up their seat and stand. It also sounds as though there's a chance they wouldn't even get a meal, since I'm sure the restaurant is expecting to cater only 50 people.\n\nThis is extremely poor planning on the part of the hostess, and would be a very uncomfortable evening for any person who was asked to stand. The mother is also being very disrespectful by going along with this possibility, and it definitely sounds as though she only wants her son there.  to \"babysit\" his father.", "This is exactly what the OP wanted to do but their mother is trying to guilt them into going anyway to help with their dad.

Really?", "If mom needs an extra caretaker for her husband for the evening she and her cousin should have worked that out so that there was sufficient room for the caretaker to sit next to dad or planned on dad staying home with OP while mom goes to the party.

No way would I go under those circumstances!", "Might be a buffet.", "And if it's not 50 meals, that means the kitchen is going to have a bunch more orders than expected all coming in at the same time and it'll end with them being slammed and everyone's food being delayed. Not to mention the poor wait staff trying to keep up with the extra numbers.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to deal with his father at an event. That\u2019s a spouse\u2019s job. If the mom can\u2019t handle the dad on her own then she needs to hire a caretaker instead of dumping the responsibility on her son. And if that\u2019s the only reason OP was invited, that\u2019s even more fucking insulting. He should stay home and tell the whole lot of them he expects an apology, and that they won\u2019t hear from him until he gets one.", "If the parents were invited he should have been included and I assume that the dads issues are not new and he is needed", "Ok, but then OP should be fine to leave, with dad in tow if needed, the moment OP is no longer as welcome as another guest.

I hope they do a head count and charge her for the extra plates.", "Might be that they expect lots of no-shows. Unpopular people of that age rely on family to fill the seats.

How does hiring a caretaker solve anything??", "I don't get why more aren't getting what you just said..", "I don't really want to live in your world.\n\nFamily's can be wonderful things and some of us like helping our friends and family.", "Oh, gosh, then I REALLY wouldn't go.", "A \"family event\" where you were just invited as a nurse and you don't even have a secured seat? \n\nLot's of people throw the \"it's family\" excuse only when you want to use family as doormats. Or use a cheap dig like \"spoilt child\" to try and get their way.", "Exactly this. If the party was set for 50 people, venues get pretty ticked if there\u2019s more. They planned for 50, there\u2019s table settings for 50. If there\u2019s servers, they planned out how many they\u2019d need based on 50 people. If it\u2019s catered, they planned food for 50 people.

If that sounds wonderful to you, then I invite you to take OP\u2019s place at the dinner, because I\u2019d rather walk on hot coals than go out of my way to attend an event where I\u2019ll only be disrespected and belittled. Blood means NOTHING without love and respect. OP\u2019s family are showing neither in this situation.", "You go ask OP where they live and go help his mum look after his dad then.", "This.  And I also find it VERY hard to believe that a venue catering for 50 can't dig up an extra chair if needed because this stuff happens all the time. People on here saying that the father is mom's responsibility-WTF? So the 21 yo son he raised shouldn't help in any way? Presumably he didn't raise himself, so what a selfish way to behave. Hope mom & dad remember the attitude when he needs something from them.\n\nYTA. Grow up", "It can also violate fire code.", "So they want an adult man to either sit on the floor or stand the whole dinner. If it's not a buffet I doubt the place would feed anyone standing. So he gets to watch everyone eat. When we had my mum and dad's silver anniversary we made sure there were seats for everyone. They are taking the piss."]}
