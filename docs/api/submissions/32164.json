It would be that \"if any other guest who is older than me comes, and does not have a seat, I must give them my seat at the table and spend the night standing\". It is important to notice that the party includes dinner, so I would have to, most likely, stand while everyone is eating and chatting.\n\nThe reason for this whole issue is that my cousin only booked for 50 seats, but will have more than 50 guests, and me being a last time guest, would have to be under those conditions.\n\nThe first thing I tols my mom when she told me that, was that I wasn't going, but she might need some help to keep an eye on my dad for some out of context circumstances related to medical issues that doesn't allow him to fluently comunicate. \n\nAfter listening to that I said that I would think about going, but that if I had to spend the night standing because of someone else wanting my seat, I would be leaving in the spot, calling a taxi and going back home without saying a word to anyone.\n\nMy mom said that it would be rude to do it, and disrespectful, and in case I'm thinking on doing that, I shouldn't go\n\nMy question is, would I be the A hole if I did that?

It's not your fault your cousin can't count and over invited. When you extend and invite to someone and they attend, YOU are THEIR guest. Therefore etiquette demands THEY ensure YOUR comfort. \n\nIt's monumentally disrespectful to force a guest to stand against a wall with a plate of food while watching everyone else have a lovely dinner. I would personally feel so uncomfortable if I saw this situation unfold and would seriously call out the host. It's one thing to voluntarily give up your sheet, it's another to force someone to give up their seat because in your mind a younger adult is still a child.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your mom only wants you there so she can fob your dad off on you while she parties the night away.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t go at all.  Those are ridiculous conditions that you have to agree to.", "NTA. \n\nThey can't invite you to a party last minute and then expect you to give up your seat for the ENTIRE night. You're not the host. It's not your duty or obligation to ensure everyone's comfort. If the hosts\u00a0are expecting more than 50 guests, they should book more than 50 seats.", "NTA\n\nIf you are invited as family, you are expected to have a seat at the table", "NTA It's rude to have these conditions. You would be reacting to rudeness.\n\nThe only reason I would go would be to help out with your dad -- but in those circumstances I would have the cousin make you an exception to the \"give up your seat\" rule as you'd be there to aid your father. If your cousin can't agree to that, don't go as your cousin would be being doubly rude. Then if you get any flak for not going you could straight up tell people that you were going to go to help your dad but your cousin wouldn't agree to guaranteeing you a seat beside your dad to allow you to do that. Let the blowback fall on your cousin where it belongs.", "nta. it is rude (disrespectful, even) to expect you to stand while others sit, and given this condition i think it\u2019s fair to view this invitation as insincere and just not go. mom can ask a guest who is not expected to stand all night to help her keep an eye on dad, or they, too, can stay home. keep in mind it\u2019s better not to go than leave in the middle.\n\neta: if anyone asks you about it just say you were told there wasn\u2019t a seat for you.", "Surely the restaurant would not allow a customer to stand and eat?\n\nIf there are 50 guests, I assume the cousin has booked the whole venue?", "NTA.

You won't just be standing there, you won't have any food.\nEither she implements a first come first served principle, or she cuts back on the guests.\n\nMy advice, just don't go. If your mom needs help with our dad, your mom needs to make it clear to her cousin you guys are a package deal, you all sit or none of you will attend.", "You do this *cough* \"I'm sick.\" just don't go. \nYou're NTA. It was a last minute invite and still not enough seats for dinner? I don't understand. Weird.

I swear these older people need to learn some manners.\n\nJust don't go.", "NTA. It's more rude to ask a guest to stand. Your aunt should not be inviting over 50 people when she only booked for 50. Everyone here is rude except you my dear. I would just not go just in case.", "NTA. If I were in your place, I wouldn't go. This scenario sounds like you are kind of tolerated to be there, but are definitely less than a person. As soon as a \"true\" guest wants your seat, you need to relinquish your comfort immediately, because clearly your needs are not important.\n\nNope. I'd have more self-worth and dignity than those people have basic human decency. Do whatever feels right, OP, but this devaluing setup does not feel right to me.\n\nYou know the saying \"You teach people how to treat you\"?

They will learn this lesson and do it again.", "NTA This is wildly rude of your cousin and honestly they probably wanted to uninvite you without actually uninviting you.", "Nta. Don't go, you're mum will have to recruit another family member to help with her husband, because it's clear you're not actyally invited by your cousin, but merely there to help your mum, and it's not reasonable to expect guests to stand.

Just don't go", "NTA. And what\u2019s wrong with your stupid mom? If you are there as a guest plus she needs your help she should be insisting that you keep your seat.

I know in my culture, it would come across as rude if a young person is seen sitting down when there are older people standing around (unless they have a reason- disabled, injured etc).

Just save yourself the hassle.", "NTA. If I were you I wouldn't go. Aside from having to stand uncomfortably or whatever, it's going to be a mess. There are 50 seats then the venue is expecting 50 people. More than that is going to create a problem and the venue is probably going to be unhappy about it. I would just save myself the hassle.", "NTA. Who the fuck invites over 50 guests when there is only 50 seats for a dinner party. \n\nI also think it's rude to make the younger adults give up their seats if someone older comes (exceptions for like really old people). Maybe they should have come earlier.", "It's rude to expect others to accommodate her for her lack of planning when inviting more guests than the number of seats she reserved. On top of that, those who are expected to give up their seats will have to stand the whole night and watch the others eat and drink, just because they're older. If your mom is also going, she can watch your dad. Being older is no excuse for AH behaviour.

Save the gift money and live your own life.", "NTA You\u2019ve been invited to a meal in a restaurant and told you won\u2019t have a seat at the table unless there is a no show by someone? Are you expected to hover alongside the table while the actual guests tuck in? Or will you be standing in the corner or another part of the restaurant? Will you even be fed? The rudeness of expecting anyone to go along with that is shocking! Will the waiter or waitress have to work around you while carrying plates of food? If I were you, I would spend the evening with your Dad and let your Mum go alone and enjoy herself.", "INFO: Mom told you the condition and you said that you'd rather not go.. but, she then coerced you to go because she needs help with your dad, but now she's saying if you plan to leave if you have to give up your seat, then you should stay home???\n\nIf this is correct, then you're NTA because you originally said you didn't want to go when you heard the conditions. As a disabled person, I am sympathetic to your dad, but also, I assume that the family knows your father's condition to the point of understanding that he requires some accommodations.", "Fuck this. Don't go. Ain't nobody got time for this kind of rubbish. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's been made painfully clear to you that you're a second-class guest, which is incredibly rude to you to begin with. I understand why you might want to make excuses to keep the peace and I won't judge you for doing that. But you would also not be the asshole if you just said flat out that your invitation seems grudging, and you are not being treated like someone your cousin actually wants to be there, so you have a long list of things you would rather be doing that evening than standing awkwardly against a wall.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure this will work the way people think, what sort of restaurant serves people standing?", "NTA.  How is it polite to invite people to a sit down dinner with not enough seats.  I hope she does not expect gifts.", "NTA, you didn't ask them to invite you, but they did, so it's their job to provide SEATING ON A RESTAURANT.  And why would you book fifty seats when you know your guest limit is over that?", "NTA The restaurant can refuse to serve anyone who is not seated at a table. Where do you put your drink?

Old people, for sure", "YTA:\n\nIf a venue is making space for a party of 50, they will be able to find an extra seat and squeeze you in.\n\nAlso, you seem to have a gripe about being treated as a child at 21, whilst you are acting like a spoilt teenager.", "Shew be less petty YTA", "Can you bring your own folding/ camp chair so you at least don\u2019t have to stand through an entire reception?", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA.

We didn't think many people would show for my grandmas funeral outside of family since she'd been on the decline with dementia for years, it was triple the size we expected.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't even go. Send a card, wish them well, and live  your life.", "Don't go. If you can't be treated like an adult, don't go. If they want all their guests to be comfortable, they should get more seating. I couldn't imagine not having a seat for each guest that is invited. That is just rude. NTA", "NTA. Kind of a rude invitation. I wouldn't go. Let mom take care of dad.", "Stay home\u2026take a stand\u2026no pun intended. I wouldn't go knowing I'll probably spend the night chairless\u2026.easier to stay home than walking out mid way.", "Bro this sounds like some ultra rich bs. YTA greedy mfer", "YTA, and an ungrateful son. You want to be treated like a man, but you act like a petulant child.", "No one is taking my sheet!", "Exactly this and even if she was a child, it wouldn't be ok to make her stand. It's fine to have a seperate kids table for actual kids but if you can't provide seating for someone, don't invite them.", "Not even sure a restaurant would allow someone to stand and eat.", "The question is whether he's TAH if he goes and leaves.  I think the answer to that is yes.  That's why he should not go unless he he can guarantee he won't be humiliated by made to stand.", "Ah yes the mighty ol'  Shirley Chisholm Maneuver", ">Initially I thought YTA\n\nWhy?", "As a disabled person, I'd be horrified if I found out that a fellow party guest was expected to stand for the whole evening (and by the sounds of it to forego dinner - restaurants don't typically serve meals to people leaning against walls instead of sitting at tables) because the host decided to gamble on whether or not I'd show. Yes, I need a seat because I can't stand for long periods, but a good host provides for their guests' comfort, not just for absolute necessity.", "I remember attending a \"business dinner\" once where around 100 guests responded they would attend, but the host only asked for catering for 80. She was banking on people declining. It was a terrible night for everyone as the food wasn't great and there also weren't enough plates!", "My mind also boggles at a 56 year old who has a birthday party with over 50 people.", "Good observation.", "You misunderstand.  Mother has told him that if he plans to leave if forced to stand he shouldn\u2019t bother going at all.  OP should just listen to his mother.", "Cause I read the title and jumped to a conclusion.", "Yaay my first reddit reply. I'm fairly new you'll have to excuse me. I understand your point, this whole thing falls on the shoulders of the host. I understand OP frustration, but what can you do at this point. You only have a few options. Be absent, be a dick, or be standing.", "Last time I went to an event like this, my chicken was raw because they were slammed. Personally, I would skip.", "Former caterer here; we absolutely count the # of guests in buffet situations.

A few people brought a \"guest\" and some last minute \"from out of town\" guests found out about it and asked if they could come too). It was a blast and the \"Bar/Grill\" loved it, as the place was reserved by us exclusively for the party and everyone ordered a Lot of drinks and quite a bit of food and tipped very well (thank God!) and the \"extra\"14 people, helped make the Bar have a fantastic night of money making! With all.that said, the poi t being, that for a \"Milestone Birthday\", it *isn't* that surprising that someone a bit *older* would have  a larger Birthday party. (Though it was and will be the last one I ever have of that size again!)", "I should definitely get a refund for the wedding I went to where they ran out of food and finally fed us KFC five minutes before the cake was cut. That marriage didn't last a year fwiw", "Is someone there decreeing who may sit and who must stand?", "Nah, even if it's a buffet the host needs to provide enough seating to allow all guests to sit down and eat simultaneously should they choose to do so. It's incredibly disrespectful to say \"at first I didn't want you to come, but now I do provided you're willing to hover around waiting for someone else to get up and move so you can sit down while you eat - which also means you're getting nowhere near the food until the guests I actually wanted have picked it clean, unless you want to eat while leaning against a wall with nobody to talk to (unless there are other filler guests in the same position)\". \n\nBirthday girl sounds like she cares a lot more about having a full room than about who actually fills it. OP is NTA for not wanting to be a background artist drafted in to complete her mental image of what the party should look like.", "I mean, it sounds completely fully even without the whole context", "My family gatherings are buffet-style, serve yourself, for exactly this reason. Nobody wants to stay where they've been sitting. Well, that, and we're not exactly rich.", "Oh God, that's awful", "I'm sure they would find another chair.  But with those conditions, why go?", "I\u2019ve only been a part of one event where the caterer and seats were from the same company and that\u2019s because it was all from the venue, so I don\u2019t really know the commonalities of the industry. Do clients have to have the amount of food match the number of chairs when they put in a catering order? Particularly when the catering isn\u2019t through the venue itself? Like, could OP\u2019s cousin order food for 75 from the caterers even if she only asked for 50 chairs from the venue or rental company?", "ROFL. Oops...my mind automatically went to the most \"important party\", cause this drama...for a bday party.\nOr maybe  I've been reading to many wedding posts on AITA.\n\nNow it's even more ridiculous.", "\u201cI mean\u201d this makes no sense.", "Not at all, but he can't really do anything to change the cousin's party planning skills, now can he? He was never contacted about going so that his dad can go and be looked after. He was contacted about whether or not he'll attend as a regular guest. So it's fair for him to say no because he never had any conversation with the host about anything other than a regular guest invitation. \nIf they pay for a caretaker to be at the party, then that's something different because they'll be having a conversation with the worker about their responsibility and what they can and can't do, and the worker can either accept the money or refuse. And if the worker is working under other people at some company, then it's still fair because that worker is being paid as compensation or that worker can still refuse (and in extreme cases quit), whereas OP wouldn't be getting anything out of this event.", "the fire code is how many ppl are allowed to safely be in a building/room in case of an emergency .. in allowing for them to exist quickly.", "\"red cheetah print\" and funeral party just don't go together in my mind.", "Grandma was awesome.

Was this a circus funeral?", "You guys don\u2019t plan your funeral in advance? You\u2019re the life of the party, gotta make sure everyone celebrates without having to worry about seating or food. Would it kill you to plan ahead?", "This group was dressed real fancy with colorful suits and hats and fur coats. They looked amazing!", "Exactly. If it's booked for 50 and OP is the only additional guest then the restaurant may well be willing to accommodate an extra person, but if there are multiple standby guests they most likely won't.", "I don\u2019t think the cousin invited him at all. I think the mother pressed the cousin because she wants OP to babysit the dad.", "Oh!  This is very much a possibility", "This is the underrated comment. The venue probably has a limit, cousin figured they could get around it, venue will do a head count and start throwing people out. \n\nNTA - cousin is clueless.", "I hope they tipped you well and not bullshit automatic 15 or 20 %.", "The typo there is great!"]}
