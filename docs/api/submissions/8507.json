I have been assisting another teacher for about 6 years, and then the last 3 years I have been teaching a class myself. We do this with about 350 kids, so all lanes are quite full as you can understand.\n\nEver since I started teaching myself, I have been dealing with my neighbors to the outside of the track, who constantly keep sending kids through my bit of class space, sending my kids, and theirs into danger (think a jerk on the highway throwing their car in front of yours in narrow gaps on the highway and then break checking you). I have asked them repeatedly to please instruct their kids to not do that, as this can cause dangerous situations as you can understand by my description above. And while I started out asking nicely, here we are three years later, and the conversations aren't as civil anymore. I've been asking the organization who I teach for to discuss this with the teachers next to me, though I have no proof that they ever did anything to discuss this issue with them.\n\nNow here is where I may be the asshole. This week is week 4 out of a 10 week course for these kids, and before I even started my class I got three comments, from not only from my neighbors, but even from higher classes' teachers, and I just said eff it. I cannot guarantee the safety of my kids anymore, so I won't be teaching anymore. I did not leave my kids high and dry as my assistant has taken over, so they're still getting taught. However I have taken off my skates and am now sitting , waiting on the bus to take me back home without the jacket  writing this post.\n\nTLDR; neighboring speed skating teachers disrespect my teaching space and bully me, so I stopped teaching.", "created_utc": 1674900880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nbtlc/aita_for_stopping_my_skating_classes_in_the/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
