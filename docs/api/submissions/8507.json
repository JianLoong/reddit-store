We do this with about 350 kids, so all lanes are quite full as you can understand.\n\nEver since I started teaching myself, I have been dealing with my neighbors to the outside of the track, who constantly keep sending kids through my bit of class space, sending my kids, and theirs into danger (think a jerk on the highway throwing their car in front of yours in narrow gaps on the highway and then break checking you). I have asked them repeatedly to please instruct their kids to not do that, as this can cause dangerous situations as you can understand by my description above. And while I started out asking nicely, here we are three years later, and the conversations aren't as civil anymore. I've been asking the organization who I teach for to discuss this with the teachers next to me, though I have no proof that they ever did anything to discuss this issue with them.\n\nNow here is where I may be the asshole. This week is week 4 out of a 10 week course for these kids, and before I even started my class I got three comments, from not only from my neighbors, but even from higher classes' teachers, and I just said eff it. I cannot guarantee the safety of my kids anymore, so I won't be teaching anymore. I did not leave my kids high and dry as my assistant has taken over, so they're still getting taught.

In my experience, things only change when parents get involved and v that might do the trick, but only if classes as such are in danger.", "I would report this org. They clearly do not have the high level of concern for safety standards like you do. And I will NEVER think that someone who has that level of concern for the safety of ANYONE is a bad thing.\n\nNTA.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc9c it's not really a career, maybe I wasn't clear enough in my post but this is a volunteer thing I do on saturdays \ud83d\ude05", "I mean, I hope there is a general consensus on keeping the kids safe, but I was taught here when I was a kid, and the safety things I was taught back then aren't really in use anymore either, so it's been slipping A LOT since I was taught two decades ago.\n\nETA: also not sure why absolutely no response has been given to my issue despite me bringing it up three years in a row ten weeks each year.", "I'm going with NTA as even if they disagree with you, you have a safety concern that sounds reasonable and has not been addressed. \n\nConsequently, you aren't comfortable teaching under the current conditions any longer.", "Do you or the teaching organization you work for officially rent and reserve the rink? Or do you set up classes during a free skate?\n\nSafety absolutely matters, but the parents seem pretty uncollaborative. I'm wondering if that's because they see your lessons as infringing on their space, rather than their kids disrupting yours.", "No it's reserved space without free use of the track. We share the ice with another organisation who teach on the opposite side, but it's (supposed to be anyway) an organized affair.", "Those speed skates are sharp. Thanks for standing up for the kids' safety. Find a less stressful volunteer activity.", "NTA as your class has coverage but maybe consider sending an email to the parents of your students to notify them on why you are ending your teaching at the location. As a parent I would want to know of a teachers safety concern, especially if it was bad enough to push you to step down.", "INFO : Have you ever gotten with the teachers directly?  And not like a hey here's this thing please change,  but more like a hey let's meet up and sit down, hash out who has what part of the ice when? Like,  define what's loosely kind of happening?", "So, because of the way the organization is run that is all very well defined and clear. In fact in the first class of the season I was a little close to the outside wall, they asked me to scooch my track out a little bit to give them a little extra space, and I did.", "Okay right on. And sounds like you did what you were aroused\n\nETA Supposed to. NOT AROUSED.  I went to hit post thinking it would give me the post to look at,  forgetting this is a response oops.\n\nSo I can't remember if you said if the organization did nothing at when you brought concerns. That's what happened right,  deaf ears? \n\nIt's hard for me to make a judgement. You left out of safety concerns for the kids. It seems by your post,  that safety standards all around have been diminishing the past two decades.  Yikes!! And not your fault. I appreciate how concerned you are. \n\nI love the ice but was always a casual skater. When leaning I learned at a busy public rink, I was 14. Not a super athlete I was just skinny. Could not yet turn and was learning crossover from uncle who played hockey.  He was there too. So I tried to turn and I shit you not when I failed I collided with an 8 year old paraplegic girl.  She was on a little sled and had a stick in each arm to propel her.  Tg she stayed on the sled.  She spun out pretty bad and lost her sticks. I felt terrible for what I did to her.  And that's public skating. I can't imagine what could go wrong in speed skating.\n\nAs a former residential camp counselor /ropes and adventure course  person I fully understand what it's like to be responsible for someone else's kids while you are doing activities that are prone to accident and injury. Rules are there for a reason. \n\n\nThat being said.  I get that you walked away with coverage,  but... is this still happening?  Are groups still infringing on each other's space in a manner that could put kids at risk for injury or preventable accidents? \n\nBecause if so.... then yes.  Most gentle soft yta. Because the voice the kids needed was yours and you took it away.  No one is advocating for the kids to be safe.  \n\n\nIs there any harm in going and filming some practices now that you're not coaching?  Let your former coach know so they're aware you're not there to teach.  But could you film them on the premise of giving them to the board?  And if the organization doesn't hear you at that point take it up with your town leaders.  Because kids safety is paramount. \n\n Either someone speaks up,  LOUDLY (if no one is listening) , or one of those kids or more will end up seriously injured in order to prompt a change.  It sounds like you had been in a position to promote safety for the kids,  and instead it seems like the voice that will be heard will be a child's injuries and the parents screaming.", "Lovely autocorrect \ud83d\ude02 but yes. I try to be mindful of others if I can be.\n\nEDIT: TYPO \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yes haha I was like oh crap Annd I was not done.  Also I don't think you're an ah.\n\n\nBut if it is still happening idk maybe you could let parents know,  and have it addressed that way?"]}
