The housing market in my area was nuts- every decent house sold above asking price in 2-4 days.\n\nGirlfriend and I (38F/38M) had been together about 3yrs. For most of that we lived in a 2BR Cottage that GF she rents from her parents. GF got laid off when COVID hit, so I took over all expenses for both of us (including paying rent to her parents) while she worked on her mental and physical health (she has depression, anxiety, and constant pain from an old injury).\n\nDuring this time we both agreed we should get a bigger house together. We were also fighting a lot- she\u2019d often demand I leave, even at night when I needed sleep for work the next day or when I needed to work in the basement office. I hated being unwelcome in the place I paid for that I considered home.\n\nI then find what I think is the right house. It's got huge master bedroom with walkin closet, 4 smaller bedrooms (small but fine for an office or kids room), yard that could be fenced in, 'good bones\u2019, and nothing seriously wrong other than some crappy paint colors. I'm interested, Girlfriend claims to be interested. I request a showing the next day.\nNext day comes, we have a fight in the morning. I several times ask to set the fight aside so we can go, but GF keeps fighting and refuses to get in the car. Eventually I say flat out 'I want you to come, I don't want to fight, but we need to leave now or we\u2019ll be late. So are you coming or not?' She says she's not coming.\n\nI see the house alone.  I take a 15min long video showing every possible detail. My position is if it's not good for Girlfriend it's not good for me- this should be OUR house. I was using 100% my own money to buy it, but with the goal of a family home we\u2019d live in together.\nI get home- Girlfriend refuses to watch the video. 'It's not my house and we won't get it anyway so why bother'. I convince her to watch it and ask for any sort of thought from her. Her answer is, and this is a direct quote- \"I don't want to answer because I don't want to get my hopes up\". I took that as a yes and told her I was going to put in an offer. She said something like 'do what you want it's not my money'. So I bought the house.\n\nGirlfriend didn't get to see the inside of the house until after contracts were signed. At this point she reveals that she hates the house, hated it when she saw the video, but never said so because she never thought I'd actually buy the house without her endorsement.\nIn her eyes, then and ever since, I'm the asshole for buying the house without a thumbs-up from her, and my agent is unprofessional for letting me buy it without my partner seeing it.\nIn my eyes, I gave her every opportunity to weigh in, if she'd said she didn't like it at any point before the contract was signed I never would have bought it.\n\nSo, AITA for buying the house without my girlfriend's explicit approval?  \n\n-----\n\n**//edit: a bit more about my GF:**  \nThis woman is, most of the time, an amazing woman, a supportive and loving partner, and a wonderful soul.\nHowever, she has been through a hell of a lot, and it's left her with scars both mental and physical.\nAmong those scars are depression and anxiety, which generally she has under control. But occasionally those scars have her under their control. When that happens, things like the day of the showing happen- logic goes out the window, whatever is wrong is my fault because I'm the asshole and I DGAF about anyone but myself because I'm selfish and I don't care about her, etc- I can argue until I'm blue in the face but she just doesn't hear it.  \n\nIt's important to understand that this story is my GF at her worst, most stressed-out, most anxiety-driven.  If she was like this all the time, I'd have left a long time ago.", "created_utc": 1674435283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10izjb6/aita_for_buying_a_house_without_my_gfs_explicit/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First, it's not healthy to ask someone to leave shared housing, particularly if the person you're asking to leave is the one paying for said housing. Second, you offered your girlfriend umpteen opportunities to view and veto the purchase before you made it. She can't play these passive aggressive games and then get upset when you move forward. (The one who is passive aggressive is always the asshole.) Your girlfriend is not acting like a normal person in a partnership. Rather, she's acting like someone who wants to break up but who is too scared to actually pull the trigger.

Sounds like you did everything you could. Honestly, I would wait a few days to talk about it again.

Do you want to raise kids with someone who behaves this way every time you disagree?", "NTA - live in your house and find a new GF. She may have health issues but you don't take that out on your SO, especially when they are stepping up for you.    You are trying to have an independent future, where she seems happy to just stay in her parents property forever (or until she inherits it maybe?).   \n\nThe disagreement started long before you bought this house.  The house is a proxy for her  control - as long as you live in her parents house, you have no hand in this - if the relationship fails, you are the one left high and dry.

And her throwing you out of your current home, the tantrum on the day of the showing and refusing to watch your video are all signs of the depth of her issues and that it\u2019s time for you to exit and move into this house.

You expect your girlfriend to move with you, but she doesn't have to. You gave her options to weigh in and didn't shut her out, but she's been shutting you out. If she wants to continue the relationship, she may need to work on this, otherwise she'll be leaving your house when you fight.", "NTA, firstly, you're not married, so what you do with your money is entirely up to you. Secondly, why on earth are you two together? Neither of you is happy, she regularly kicks you out of the house, is she planning on doing that in a house that you own? Mate, run, not only is this is a girl you shouldn't be looking at being with long term, this is a girl you shouldn't be with at all. Relationships aren't meant to be that difficult.", "NTA \n\nYou gave them every opportunity to have an opinion in this process.

Better to have wasted 3 years, cut things off now, rather than a divorce in 10 years with 3 kids.\n\nEdit OP added more: I know you say this her at her worst, and this was just ONE day, but it wasnt.

NTA but come on dude, you guys are barely even living together anymore.", "NAH\n\nShe was being petulant, you needed to move quickly.", "NAH- clearly gf\u2019s mental health that you already identified got in the way of her participating in this decision.

I was in almost the same damn situation back in 2021. I found an amazing house where I live, great price, amazing interest rate everything was perfect about it. Big ass fight with my girlfriend because she chose to go shopping with her mom instead of seeing the house and even more irate that the realtor was a female.

After reading this I seriously hope girlfriend is in therapy and actually working through her issues. You did not feel comfortable in the home you were paying rent to her parents because she held ultimate control and was not shy about using it to your detriment. You gave her more than ample opportunity to voice her opinions and concerns she chose not to. She is an adult, even with her mental issues she made a choice to not participate in the purchase of the home. That is on her 100%, and that is the honest straight out facts.", "NTA. Seriously, do you want a partner for your life or this woman who acts more like a child?", "NTA But everyone, ignore OP because he didnt come here looking for advice or a judgment, he came here to self justify why he stayed with a horrible partner for 3 years and has nothing to show for it. He has no self-respect and won't grow a spine to end a relationship with a bad and abusive partner.", "NTA.  A gf is not a wife.  If you get married, she can house shop online to her hearts content to find something comparable.", "NTA. She needs to grow up. You gave her every chance to view it and in multiple ways. She had a tantrum over it. Then she says she doesn\u2019t want to see it until contracts are signed so she doesn\u2019t get her hopes up. Now she hates it. She also tried the bullshit \u201cit\u2019s your money do whatever you want\u201d as a guilt trip. Is she often stubborn like this on all decisions? I couldn\u2019t be with somebody who even refuses to compromise.", "NTA, but bordering on ESH. This relationship isn't healthy, and you shouldn't be considering/continuing it with even the issues you've detailed here. Almost ESH because presumably you intended to continue to cohabitate and continue your lives together, and you bought something without her full buy-in. However....\n\nAssuming she didn't sign any paperwork and you bought it yourself, you're free to move into the house you bought and paid for and leave her in the cottage that she's renting from her parents. This seems like the most convenient and appropriate time to move on from a toxic relationship. Thusly, NTA, but run away.", "ESH is the most appropriate of the options. It\u2019s definitely an AH move to buy a house and expect her to live in it when she hasn\u2019t really seen it, much less agreed to it. You needed a lot more buy-in from her than you got. But you should be able to buy a house that you want and can afford, and continue to build your future. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s interested in that if she\u2019s going to obstruct any efforts.\n\nAll of that said, your real crime here OP is staying in a relationship when you\u2019re both obviously not aligned in its direction. She clearly wants to keep renting from her parents; you want to progress and evolve. She\u2019s wrong to hold you back, you\u2019re wrong to drag her along. It\u2019s not even that ESH, it\u2019s just that everyone here is wrong for each other.", "NTA. She said do what you want, and you tried to include her. Though, I would also say soft ESH. I can see why she\u2019d be upset. \n\nI think this problem runs deeper than just this situation. You and your GF either need to take some time to learn how to communicate with each other healthily, or you should reconsider the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And the way to show people accountability starts with enforcing consequences on them.", "Dude, you are making a lot of excuses for her and overlooking many red flags. This was not the time for an engagement - more like, time to proceed with caution.", "Women in abusive relationships aren't beaten everyday either. They'll probably tell you their abuser is great \"most of the time\" too. Get out.", "I was in a relationship with an abusive partner for several years. Reading what you wrote here was\u2026 a flashback to that. And like you, I made every excuse. I would paper over the bad times with those good times. But, things were always my fault. I was the selfish one. I was never right. I was completely lost with all the gaslighting. It took a long time and a lot of heartache to see things for what they really were, even when other people told me or tried to help.\n\nAt the very least, you need couple\u2019s counseling. There needs to be ownership and responsibility for actions, even when influenced by mental health challenges. That is not a free pass.\n\nGood luck to you both\u2026", "Now wait for the day when she is having a bad day like you mentioned (which I don't believe) and tells you to get out of the house you purchased and then come to back to comments on this post and find out most of the predications were true.\n\nJust as a side note -  True nature comes out when they are at their worst.", "Where I'm from the purchase agreement usually has an amount of ernest money put up front by the buyer.  Mine was 1k.  I wonder if OP would have lost any money and how much if they pulled out.  Read a story on here where a couple lost like 40k in ernest money because the wife opened a new line of credit causing their loan to fall through.", "It\u2019s your life but this whole thing sounds exhausting and depressing. And I don\u2019t mean the house.", "don't you see, she would not approve any house, as it take the leverage of kicking you in the middle of the night.\n\nWhat up with that, really? The second time she would do that, I would never return \n\nNTA", "Exactly what I thought when reading it.  If someone is a perfect angel for 99 days and beats you up on day 100, they\u2019re still an abusive AH, regardless of upbringing or past trauma.", "Yeah GF is blaming not getting therapy on having multiple bad therapists in the past, or OP being too good at articulating their problems\u2026anyone else seeing a pattern here where nothing is ever her fault?", "Yes OP, your gf wasn\u2019t just having her worst day during the showing.  The whole process was her finding things to blame you for.  This was a huge relationship moment (test if you will) and your gf is not there with you.  \n\nYou were going to buy the house 100% for you both, and she\u2019s always going to see it as just your house that she never approved of.  \n\nThree years isn\u2019t that long. You\u2019re still getting to know your gf right now, don\u2019t ignore the signs because the honeymoon phase was good.", "Leave her. She'll never improve if you're always around to enable and validate her abusive behaviours.", "Not on how to help, but just so you know - fights like the ones you describe are not normal. Fighting that much is not normal or healthy in a relationship. Especially fights where she asks you to leave, it sounds like somewhat frequently!? Really not normal.", "Her mental health issues may not be her fault, but they are her responsibility. If she is not going to therapy and doing things to improve her condition, she doesn\u2019t deserve to be with you and frankly is not someone you want to have children with.\n\nI am saying this as someone who has been diagnosed with bipolar, bpd, and anxiety. I have been incredibly toxic and awful and felt out of control. But I did the work. A lot of fucking hard work and now I have zero tolerance for people who aren\u2019t willing to do the work, but think they can abuse people because they themselves are hurting. If she knows there\u2019s a problem but isn\u2019t doing anything to change it, then I think for the sake of your heart in the long run, you need to leave.\n\nI truly, from the bottom of my heart, wish so hard that she chooses to take accountability and chooses recovery. I have been her and I have been you, and they are both such awful places to be in. I wish you both the best of luck.", "Good luck losing everything mate .", "You don\u2019t want judgment because you are not listening to anyone here. It seems that your GF has successfully browbeat you into believing that the way that she treats you 75% of the time should make it okay to put up with the 25% of horror. That is no way to live life. You also need to look at the fact that this was 1.5 years ago and you\u2019ll are still having words about it and neither of you\u2019ll are completely living in the house. You need therapy. I don\u2019t even care about her at this point. You need to talk to someone about why this relationship seems like a good idea to you. You need to talk to someone about why you feel that you are not worth more than paying two sets of rent because they want to have a place that\u2019s \u201ctheirs.\u201d The cottage is still not hers because you pay for it. You need to talk to someone about why you haven\u2019t made it a top priority to get the house to a truly livable state so that you can both move into it or you can sell it for another place. It\u2019s almost like you know that she\u2019s going to have a problem with that as well and you want to keep with a viable excuse for not moving in so that you don\u2019t have to deal with the fact that you\u2019ll are not meant to be together. \n\nSeriously, please go talk to someone and don\u2019t even worry about couples counseling at this point. You need to worry about yourself. Also, is your GF\u2019s problems in the past with therapy as relayed by her or were you actually around to experience these things? I worry that she is not being truthful about those things. \n\nI wish you luck and I truly hope that you get help so that you become truly aware of who you are and what you deserve.", "Dude's already burnt to a crisp and can't even tell. Some people are blinded by love, some get their eyes gouged out.", "Yep - I didn't think it was possible to read a thread called \"AITA for buying a house without my GF's explicit approval?\" and answer NTA but here we go! She was never going to give him her approval for any house - she wanted something to hold over his head so she can use it against him. \n\nI think asking him to sleep on the couch is... not perfect but it's still something I could see as acceptable when somebody is mentally very unwell, but kicking him out of the house?\n\nShe can be mentally unwell and going through a lot and still be a bad partner, and at the very very least, she's being a bad partner. Your mental health isn't an excuse to treat somebody like this - this manipulation and control is on her. She's going to get worse, and OP's going to excuse it.", "Read back your own words for the love of god and now imagine her acting this way with *your children*. This woman is emotionally manipulative and abusive and will act the same to your kids if you choose to be with her. And if that\u2019s your choice, please don\u2019t bring children into this knowing how she will treat them. Holy shit.", "Look, even if you\u2019re ok with being in an abusive relationship, are you really ok with signing up your future children for a lifetime with an emotionally and verbally abusive mother?\n\nYou say that the reason she has mental health problems is because of what she\u2019s gone through, and now you\u2019re planning to condemn your future children to the same fate by signing them up for a childhood full of trauma. \n\nHer issues might not be her fault, but it is her responsibility to deal with them before she gets into a romantic relationship, much less before she has children.", "I mean don't get me wrong. You relationship can last forever if your willing to eat shit for a lifetime. That's up to you.", "Take her to therapy, any type of it. It doesnt matter if it isnt 1-1, maybe group therapy, animal therapy... \n\nI've the same diagnosis than your fiancee, I was in Uni, working, in a relationship and everything got out of control that I was suicidal. Do you know what helped me? I had a complete break down infront of someone who didnt want me to waste away, my mom, she helped me find a good doctor, a therapist, neuropsychiatrist and wfh... \n\nHer behavior is hers to deal, but You can help her see that with your own boundaries"]}
