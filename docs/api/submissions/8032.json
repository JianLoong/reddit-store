The housing market in my area was nuts- every decent house sold above asking price in 2-4 days.\n\nGirlfriend and I (38F/38M) had been together about 3yrs. For most of that we lived in a 2BR Cottage that GF she rents from her parents. GF got laid off when COVID hit, so I took over all expenses for both of us (including paying rent to her parents) while she worked on her mental and physical health (she has depression, anxiety, and constant pain from an old injury).\n\nDuring this time we both agreed we should get a bigger house together. We were also fighting a lot- she\u2019d often demand I leave, even at night when I needed sleep for work the next day or when I needed to work in the basement office. I hated being unwelcome in the place I paid for that I considered home.\n\nI then find what I think is the right house. It's got huge master bedroom with walkin closet, 4 smaller bedrooms (small but fine for an office or kids room), yard that could be fenced in, 'good bones\u2019, and nothing seriously wrong other than some crappy paint colors. I'm interested, Girlfriend claims to be interested. I request a showing the next day.\nNext day comes, we have a fight in the morning. I several times ask to set the fight aside so we can go, but GF keeps fighting and refuses to get in the car. Eventually I say flat out 'I want you to come, I don't want to fight, but we need to leave now or we\u2019ll be late. So are you coming or not?' She says she's not coming.\n\nI see the house alone.  I take a 15min long video showing every possible detail. My position is if it's not good for Girlfriend it's not good for me- this should be OUR house. I was using 100% my own money to buy it, but with the goal of a family home we\u2019d live in together.\nI get home- Girlfriend refuses to watch the video. 'It's not my house and we won't get it anyway so why bother'. I convince her to watch it and ask for any sort of thought from her. Her answer is, and this is a direct quote- \"I don't want to answer because I don't want to get my hopes up\". I took that as a yes and told her I was going to put in an offer. She said something like 'do what you want it's not my money'. So I bought the house.\n\nGirlfriend didn't get to see the inside of the house until after contracts were signed. At this point she reveals that she hates the house, hated it when she saw the video, but never said so because she never thought I'd actually buy the house without her endorsement.\nIn her eyes, then and ever since, I'm the asshole for buying the house without a thumbs-up from her, and my agent is unprofessional for letting me buy it without my partner seeing it.\nIn my eyes, I gave her every opportunity to weigh in, if she'd said she didn't like it at any point before the contract was signed I never would have bought it.\n\nSo, AITA for buying the house without my girlfriend's explicit approval?  \n\n-----\n\n**//edit: a bit more about my GF:**  \nThis woman is, most of the time, an amazing woman, a supportive and loving partner, and a wonderful soul.\nHowever, she has been through a hell of a lot, and it's left her with scars both mental and physical.\nAmong those scars are depression and anxiety, which generally she has under control. But occasionally those scars have her under their control. When that happens, things like the day of the showing happen- logic goes out the window, whatever is wrong is my fault because I'm the asshole and I DGAF about anyone but myself because I'm selfish and I don't care about her, etc- I can argue until I'm blue in the face but she just doesn't hear it.  \n\nIt's important to understand that this story is my GF at her worst, most stressed-out, most anxiety-driven.  If she was like this all the time, I'd have left a long time ago.", "created_utc": 1674435283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10izjb6/aita_for_buying_a_house_without_my_gfs_explicit/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First, it's not healthy to ask someone to leave shared housing, particularly if the person you're asking to leave is the one paying for said housing. Second, you offered your girlfriend umpteen opportunities to view and veto the purchase before you made it. She can't play these passive aggressive games and then get upset when you move forward. (The one who is passive aggressive is always the asshole.) Your girlfriend is not acting like a normal person in a partnership. Rather, she's acting like someone who wants to break up but who is too scared to actually pull the trigger.

Do you want to raise kids with someone who behaves this way every time you disagree?", "NTA - live in your house and find a new GF. She may have health issues but you don't take that out on your SO, especially when they are stepping up for you.    You are trying to have an independent future, where she seems happy to just stay in her parents property forever (or until she inherits it maybe?).   \n\nThe disagreement started long before you bought this house.  The house is a proxy for her  control - as long as you live in her parents house, you have no hand in this - if the relationship fails, you are the one left high and dry.

And her throwing you out of your current home, the tantrum on the day of the showing and refusing to watch your video are all signs of the depth of her issues and that it\u2019s time for you to exit and move into this house.

You expect your girlfriend to move with you, but she doesn't have to. You gave her options to weigh in and didn't shut her out, but she's been shutting you out. If she wants to continue the relationship, she may need to work on this, otherwise she'll be leaving your house when you fight.", "NTA, firstly, you're not married, so what you do with your money is entirely up to you. Secondly, why on earth are you two together? Neither of you is happy, she regularly kicks you out of the house, is she planning on doing that in a house that you own? Mate, run, not only is this is a girl you shouldn't be looking at being with long term, this is a girl you shouldn't be with at all. Relationships aren't meant to be that difficult.", "NTA \n\nYou gave them every opportunity to have an opinion in this process.

Better to have wasted 3 years, cut things off now, rather than a divorce in 10 years with 3 kids.\n\nEdit OP added more: I know you say this her at her worst, and this was just ONE day, but it wasnt.

NTA but come on dude, you guys are barely even living together anymore.", "NAH\n\nShe was being petulant, you needed to move quickly.", "NAH- clearly gf\u2019s mental health that you already identified got in the way of her participating in this decision.

I was in almost the same damn situation back in 2021. I found an amazing house where I live, great price, amazing interest rate everything was perfect about it. Big ass fight with my girlfriend because she chose to go shopping with her mom instead of seeing the house and even more irate that the realtor was a female.

After reading this I seriously hope girlfriend is in therapy and actually working through her issues. You did not feel comfortable in the home you were paying rent to her parents because she held ultimate control and was not shy about using it to your detriment. You gave her more than ample opportunity to voice her opinions and concerns she chose not to. She is an adult, even with her mental issues she made a choice to not participate in the purchase of the home. That is on her 100%, and that is the honest straight out facts.", "NTA. Seriously, do you want a partner for your life or this woman who acts more like a child?", "NTA But everyone, ignore OP because he didnt come here looking for advice or a judgment, he came here to self justify why he stayed with a horrible partner for 3 years and has nothing to show for it. He has no self-respect and won't grow a spine to end a relationship with a bad and abusive partner.", "NTA.  A gf is not a wife.  If you get married, she can house shop online to her hearts content to find something comparable.", "NTA. She needs to grow up. You gave her every chance to view it and in multiple ways. She had a tantrum over it. Then she says she doesn\u2019t want to see it until contracts are signed so she doesn\u2019t get her hopes up. Now she hates it. She also tried the bullshit \u201cit\u2019s your money do whatever you want\u201d as a guilt trip. Is she often stubborn like this on all decisions? I couldn\u2019t be with somebody who even refuses to compromise.", "NTA, but bordering on ESH. This relationship isn't healthy, and you shouldn't be considering/continuing it with even the issues you've detailed here. Almost ESH because presumably you intended to continue to cohabitate and continue your lives together, and you bought something without her full buy-in. However....\n\nAssuming she didn't sign any paperwork and you bought it yourself, you're free to move into the house you bought and paid for and leave her in the cottage that she's renting from her parents. This seems like the most convenient and appropriate time to move on from a toxic relationship. Thusly, NTA, but run away.", "ESH is the most appropriate of the options. It\u2019s definitely an AH move to buy a house and expect her to live in it when she hasn\u2019t really seen it, much less agreed to it. You needed a lot more buy-in from her than you got. But you should be able to buy a house that you want and can afford, and continue to build your future. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s interested in that if she\u2019s going to obstruct any efforts.\n\nAll of that said, your real crime here OP is staying in a relationship when you\u2019re both obviously not aligned in its direction. She clearly wants to keep renting from her parents; you want to progress and evolve. She\u2019s wrong to hold you back, you\u2019re wrong to drag her along. It\u2019s not even that ESH, it\u2019s just that everyone here is wrong for each other.", "NTA. She said do what you want, and you tried to include her. Though, I would also say soft ESH. I can see why she\u2019d be upset. \n\nI think this problem runs deeper than just this situation. You and your GF either need to take some time to learn how to communicate with each other healthily, or you should reconsider the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds harsh but according to you she is constantly acting ridiculous and refuses to do things to change other than working out. \n\nYou realize you are actively enabling her behavior, and the longer you continue to relent to her insane demands  the probably worse she's going to get. \n\nNext time she kick you out say no, and dont even allow her to go to the other property if she leaves.

So, short 'easy' answer-- tell her to get her ass in here or get a job because I ain't payin for the cottage no more.  I'd be well within my rights to say that, and if I made an 'AITA for telling my GF to live with me or pay for her own housing' I'd be not the asshole.  \n\nAt the same time- GF hates construction and noise and that sort of thing.  She gets migraines.  So if I'm gonna do more major construction here, it should be BEFORE she moves in.  And I should clean up all the storage boxes and tools and stuff that are everywhere.  \nTHAT is on me- that's stuff I've not done for a year plus since I bought the place.  And that's valid reasons for her to NOT move in.  \nDo you agree?  \n\nA big part of why I shower here is the cottage only has one bathroom and it's right next to the master bedroom.  I wake up at like 5-6am, she wakes up at 7-8am.  We go to sleep together, she just needs more sleep.  So this way I can just sneak out and my house is 10 mins away; it wakes her up less than if I shower at the cottage.  \n\nI keep my office here because here I have an entire room for my office- desk with 3 big monitors, phone, printer, 3d printer, tools, the works.  I have windows and an exterior view.  At the cottage I have a small nook in the basement with very little sun (and I usually close a curtain to keep the heat in); it's a micro workstation with two smaller monitors and no desk phone.  \n\nAnd then I have a ton of random stuff- when it was all at the cottage it was a big source of clutter.  \n\nPoint is- it's easy to look at what I write and say 'that dude's half out anyway'.

You can\u2019t. She has to do it for herself. What you can and should do is learn to set healthy boundaries for yourself and for the love of god, do not have children with her.

She may need to take a minute to calm down but for the most part she expresses that as such and does it.
