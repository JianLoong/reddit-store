The housing market in my area was nuts- every decent house sold above asking price in 2-4 days.\n\nGirlfriend and I (38F/38M) had been together about 3yrs. For most of that we lived in a 2BR Cottage that GF she rents from her parents. GF got laid off when COVID hit, so I took over all expenses for both of us (including paying rent to her parents) while she worked on her mental and physical health (she has depression, anxiety, and constant pain from an old injury).\n\nDuring this time we both agreed we should get a bigger house together. We were also fighting a lot- she\u2019d often demand I leave, even at night when I needed sleep for work the next day or when I needed to work in the basement office. I hated being unwelcome in the place I paid for that I considered home.\n\nI then find what I think is the right house. It's got huge master bedroom with walkin closet, 4 smaller bedrooms (small but fine for an office or kids room), yard that could be fenced in, 'good bones\u2019, and nothing seriously wrong other than some crappy paint colors. I'm interested, Girlfriend claims to be interested. I request a showing the next day.\nNext day comes, we have a fight in the morning. I several times ask to set the fight aside so we can go, but GF keeps fighting and refuses to get in the car. Eventually I say flat out 'I want you to come, I don't want to fight, but we need to leave now or we\u2019ll be late. So are you coming or not?' She says she's not coming.\n\nI see the house alone.  I take a 15min long video showing every possible detail. My position is if it's not good for Girlfriend it's not good for me- this should be OUR house. I was using 100% my own money to buy it, but with the goal of a family home we\u2019d live in together.\nI get home- Girlfriend refuses to watch the video. 'It's not my house and we won't get it anyway so why bother'. I convince her to watch it and ask for any sort of thought from her. Her answer is, and this is a direct quote- \"I don't want to answer because I don't want to get my hopes up\". I took that as a yes and told her I was going to put in an offer. She said something like 'do what you want it's not my money'. So I bought the house.\n\nGirlfriend didn't get to see the inside of the house until after contracts were signed. At this point she reveals that she hates the house, hated it when she saw the video, but never said so because she never thought I'd actually buy the house without her endorsement.\nIn her eyes, then and ever since, I'm the asshole for buying the house without a thumbs-up from her, and my agent is unprofessional for letting me buy it without my partner seeing it.\nIn my eyes, I gave her every opportunity to weigh in, if she'd said she didn't like it at any point before the contract was signed I never would have bought it.\n\nSo, AITA for buying the house without my girlfriend's explicit approval?  \n\n-----\n\n**//edit: a bit more about my GF:**  \nThis woman is, most of the time, an amazing woman, a supportive and loving partner, and a wonderful soul.\nHowever, she has been through a hell of a lot, and it's left her with scars both mental and physical.\nAmong those scars are depression and anxiety, which generally she has under control. But occasionally those scars have her under their control. When that happens, things like the day of the showing happen- logic goes out the window, whatever is wrong is my fault because I'm the asshole and I DGAF about anyone but myself because I'm selfish and I don't care about her, etc- I can argue until I'm blue in the face but she just doesn't hear it.  \nThat's NOT a common thing though.  It's just unfortunate she had an anxiety episode the day of the showing.  \n\nIt's important to understand that this story is my GF at her worst, most stressed-out, most anxiety-driven.  If she was like this all the time, I'd have left a long time ago.", "created_utc": 1674435283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10izjb6/aita_for_buying_a_house_without_my_gfs_explicit/", "score": 1126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First, it's not healthy to ask someone to leave shared housing, particularly if the person you're asking to leave is the one paying for said housing. Second, you offered your girlfriend umpteen opportunities to view and veto the purchase before you made it. She can't play these passive aggressive games and then get upset when you move forward. (The one who is passive aggressive is always the asshole.) Your girlfriend is not acting like a normal person in a partnership. Rather, she's acting like someone who wants to break up but who is too scared to actually pull the trigger.

Sounds like you did everything you could. Honestly, I would wait a few days to talk about it again.

Do you want to raise kids with someone who behaves this way every time you disagree?", "NTA - live in your house and find a new GF. She may have health issues but you don't take that out on your SO, especially when they are stepping up for you.    You are trying to have an independent future, where she seems happy to just stay in her parents property forever (or until she inherits it maybe?).   \n\nThe disagreement started long before you bought this house.  The house is a proxy for her  control - as long as you live in her parents house, you have no hand in this - if the relationship fails, you are the one left high and dry.  Buying the house by yourself means you are flipping this script, and she doesn't like that, as demonstrated  by her belligerence.  The only middle ground was to buy something together, which she did not want to do - maybe she is telling you exactly where you stand here.", "NTA at all.

I think you need to get out of this relationship.  GF seems immature and manipulative.", "So very NTA. And her throwing you out of your current home, the tantrum on the day of the showing and refusing to watch your video are all signs of the depth of her issues and that it\u2019s time for you to exit and move into this house.

You have to cater to her childish behavior.  You have to deal with being yelled at.", "NTA. \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not a house she loves but if it is at least of an appropriate size you can surely live there for a while and eventually sell and buy a place you both like. \n\nPersonally I probably wouldn\u2019t have bought without buy-in from my partner\u2026but my partner would never do something like this to me so that isn\u2019t really fair.", "NTA\n\nThis is your money and your house. You expect your girlfriend to move with you, but she doesn't have to. You gave her options to weigh in and didn't shut her out, but she's been shutting you out. If she wants to continue the relationship, she may need to work on this, otherwise she'll be leaving your house when you fight.", "NTA, firstly, you're not married, so what you do with your money is entirely up to you. Secondly, why on earth are you two together? Neither of you is happy, she regularly kicks you out of the house, is she planning on doing that in a house that you own? Mate, run, not only is this is a girl you shouldn't be looking at being with long term, this is a girl you shouldn't be with at all. Relationships aren't meant to be that difficult.", "NTA \n\nYou gave them every opportunity to have an opinion in this process. They decided to not participate in communicating with their partner after multiple attempts. \n\nQuestion: Do you really see yourself building a family and future with someone who wants to behave so childishly on important relationship matters? May want to rethink your compatibility my guy. Better to have wasted 3 years, cut things off now, rather than a divorce in 10 years with 3 kids.\n\nEdit OP added more: I know you say this her at her worst, and this was just ONE day, but it wasnt.

NTA but come on dude, you guys are barely even living together anymore.", "NAH\n\nShe was being petulant, you needed to move quickly.", "NAH- clearly gf\u2019s mental health that you already identified got in the way of her participating in this decision.

I was in almost the same damn situation back in 2021. I found an amazing house where I live, great price, amazing interest rate everything was perfect about it. Big ass fight with my girlfriend because she chose to go shopping with her mom instead of seeing the house and even more irate that the realtor was a female.

After reading this I seriously hope girlfriend is in therapy and actually working through her issues. You did not feel comfortable in the home you were paying rent to her parents because she held ultimate control and was not shy about using it to your detriment. You gave her more than ample opportunity to voice her opinions and concerns she chose not to. She is an adult, even with her mental issues she made a choice to not participate in the purchase of the home. That is on her 100%, and that is the honest straight out facts.", "NTA. Seriously, do you want a partner for your life or this woman who acts more like a child?", "NTA But everyone, ignore OP because he didnt come here looking for advice or a judgment, he came here to self justify why he stayed with a horrible partner for 3 years and has nothing to show for it. He has no self-respect and won't grow a spine to end a relationship with a bad and abusive partner.", "NTA.  A gf is not a wife.  If you get married, she can house shop online to her hearts content to find something comparable.", "NTA. She needs to grow up. You gave her every chance to view it and in multiple ways. She had a tantrum over it. Then she says she doesn\u2019t want to see it until contracts are signed so she doesn\u2019t get her hopes up. Now she hates it. She also tried the bullshit \u201cit\u2019s your money do whatever you want\u201d as a guilt trip. Is she often stubborn like this on all decisions? I couldn\u2019t be with somebody who even refuses to compromise.", "NTA, but bordering on ESH. This relationship isn't healthy, and you shouldn't be considering/continuing it with even the issues you've detailed here. Almost ESH because presumably you intended to continue to cohabitate and continue your lives together, and you bought something without her full buy-in. However....\n\nAssuming she didn't sign any paperwork and you bought it yourself, you're free to move into the house you bought and paid for and leave her in the cottage that she's renting from her parents. This seems like the most convenient and appropriate time to move on from a toxic relationship. Thusly, NTA, but run away.", "ESH is the most appropriate of the options. It\u2019s definitely an AH move to buy a house and expect her to live in it when she hasn\u2019t really seen it, much less agreed to it. You needed a lot more buy-in from her than you got. But you should be able to buy a house that you want and can afford, and continue to build your future. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s interested in that if she\u2019s going to obstruct any efforts.\n\nAll of that said, your real crime here OP is staying in a relationship when you\u2019re both obviously not aligned in its direction. She clearly wants to keep renting from her parents; you want to progress and evolve. She\u2019s wrong to hold you back, you\u2019re wrong to drag her along. It\u2019s not even that ESH, it\u2019s just that everyone here is wrong for each other.", "NTA. She said do what you want, and you tried to include her. Though, I would also say soft ESH. I can see why she\u2019d be upset. \n\nI think this problem runs deeper than just this situation. You and your GF either need to take some time to learn how to communicate with each other healthily, or you should reconsider the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of moving into your house and living your life, you've found a \"solution\" for the things that bother her. You don't shower at the cottage because it disturbs her. You have a separate work space in your house so now she doesn't have to worry about disturbing you and can make as much noise etc without you getting upset. \n\nInstead of actually solving the main reasons why you have relationship issues, you've just been coming up with more temporary fixes.\n\nYou bought a house \"without\" her. You took a step towards independence and she doesn't like that. So the result is \"better\" behavior on her part because now you actually have a place to go without her. Your house will never be good enough for her no matter what you \"fix\" in it because she didn't have control over your actions. You could have bought her dream house, and she still would have said it was wrong because you didn't do it her way.\n\nIt's really not about her not being able to think clearly or logically, she's using that as an excuse because she won't address the real issues that are bothering her. She doesn't trust you. That's what this all boils down to. She wants to have everything her way, or at least mostly her way and \"allows\" you to have just enough freedom to stick with the relationship. In other words, she keeps you on a short leash. \n\nYou did everything right in regards to buying your house. You asked for her input, she refused. She doesn't get to flip the script and say that you did it without her. She actively didn't participate in the process. She went out of her way to refuse to being part of the process and only spoke up after it was \"too late\" to voice her displeasure. \n\nIdeally, no you wouldn't buy a large purchase without full support from your partner, and dollars to donuts that's why you think she's \"right\" to be upset. But you were pushed into it because of her own actions. She was perfectly fine with making you homeless and you living out of hotels because those are all temporary solutions. You were supposed to come crawling back to her and be grateful that she still allows you to be part of her life and live in her home. \n\nWith a normal, healthy dynamic, you would have a basic level of trust in your partner to take care of major situations without both parties involved. Instead of just acknowledging that you did the best you could to improve both of your situations, and giving the imperfect house a chance, she's shut down and refusing. It's okay for you to be in \"temporary\" situations, but not her. And that's just it. This house doesn't have to be your forever home, it just needed to be an overall better living arrangement. Which it seems like it should fit both of your basic necessities.  This should have been a temporary solution that would at least move your relationship in the right direction. \n\nYou're stuck in limbo right now. You are to the point where love isn't enough to sustain the relationship. To have a healthy successful relationship you need more than just love. Stop enabling and excusing the major issues you guys have. Nothing is going to really improve until she wants things to. She's happy with the way things are. She lives in her home, you move mountains to \"not bother\" her, you excuse her bad behavior because you love her, and for all that she just needs to give you a small inkling of happiness and support. She's putting in the bare minimum of effort into the relationship and letting you do all the heavy lifting. It's not sustainable. \n\nSit down and talk out a plan together. For example: Take two weeks off and move into your house. Work on getting it prepared for living in 24/7. Let her know that she can come over anytime, call you anytime, but if she wants to spend time with you, it needs to be at your house. Don't reach out to her, let her initiate all the contact. And let her know that this is your expectation, you will be busy focusing on getting everything as best as you can for her to move in at the end of February. She can even give you a reasonable list of must have completed tasks. Ask her to commit to living in the house for one year. After 6 months, plan an initial discussion on how she feels about the house after living in it. And if she's still uncomfortable living in the house, take the next six months to do a house hunt together. Write out a list of must have, would be nice, and acceptable features for your dream house. Work together to prioritize and compromise. \n\nThis will do several things to overall help clarify your relationship. It will help her communicate her thoughts and needs when it comes to the relationship and give you a break from the emotional labor, it gives her a chance to step up and truly invest in the relationship. It will give you the space you need to do some serious thinking about if you miss her or just the thought of her, and how often you initiate things as opposed to how often she does. If she's unwilling to even participate in the plan, well then you know she's unwilling to even try to make things better in your relationship.

I just want to tell you a story\n\nMe and my ex boyfriend had gone to shop one day, we needed to get some groceries for dinner. At the shop, we get into a little fight which emotionally drained me so I just became quiet, I wanted to get out of the shop as soon as possible. After we got the groceries he dragged me to the section where they sell junk food and asked me to pick one. I said I don\u2019t want to pick one, I don\u2019t want anything, I just want to go home. He insisted for like 5 minutes, told me to \u201cpick something you love, I want to buy you something, just pick one\u201d I felt annoyed so I just picked one bag of chips. He didn\u2019t say anything at the moment, we go to the paying section, he still didn\u2019t say anything, we left, he STILL didn\u2019t say anything and when we\u2019re far away from the store, he told me \u201cwhy did you chose something only you liked?\u201d (mind you, he liked chips, he also liked the brand I choose because we had similar taste, it just wasn\u2019t his favorite) I asked him \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\nHe then said (and this a direct quote) \u201cIt is really unbelievable how selfish you can be. You knew what I liked and you still chose something else\u201d I tried to explain to him that I didn\u2019t even wanted to buy chips, I felt annoyed after all the pressure he put on me to pick something, so I just grabbed first thing I saw. It wasn\u2019t a explanation for him at all. He still blamed me to be selfish and ungrateful. No matter how much I tried to explain myself, it didn\u2019t made a difference. I felt extremely guilty and selfish, I thought it was really my fault. \n\nHe done this because the argument at the grocery store was his fault, he upset me and he could see it clear as the day. So instead of apologizing like a normal human, he made me  felt guilty about something else so he would not have to deal with the problem he caused. \n\nIt happens when you are in a emotionally abusive relationship. They create problems on purpose, so they can made you feel guilty, so they can control you by this guilt. Your girlfriend had every opportunity on the world to tell you she didn\u2019t liked the house but instead she waited for the time where there was nothing to do about it, you already got the house so now she can tell you everything wrong with it because you have no choice other than feel guilty. You couldn\u2019t solve the problem because she never wanted you to solve it, she just wanted you to feel guilt and regret. It makes you easy to control. If you didn\u2019t buy the house she would tell you \u201cwhy you didn\u2019t buy that house, I liked that house, how dare you not buy a house without my consent first?\u201d \n\nYou are not responsible for her mental issues.

At my worst times I have never lashed out at my partner that badly and I have a really screwed up history myself. From your comments you seem to be under the impression that your fianc\u00e9e is working towards making her mental health better, but it doesn't really sound like she is. What is she doing besides exercising? Like others have said, you cannot exercise your way out of mental illness just as much as you can't exercise your way out of cancer. You can't outrun anxiety or squat away the depression.\n\nIt doesn't matter how she feels about it, she needs to see a therapist and maybe a psychiatrist because it doesn't sound like she is taking any medication either, and when it's that bad she probably needs to. I have also had incredibly bad experiences with therapists so I can relate to this struggle as well, but do you know what I did when I realized that therapy was my only option? I just kept looking. I've had therapists blame me for my abuse and refuse to diagnose me with things I obviously had, I just kept on fighting and looking for the right people. I'm finally at a point now where I developed the tools to be able to function by myself and don't need therapy anymore, but even now I still need medication. This is to show that your fianc\u00e9e REALLY needs to start doing something, because mental illness is not easy to defeat. I have been told I will never overcome it fully, and it might be the same for your fianc\u00e9e. So unless you start treating it right now, it's just going to keep dictating your lives forever. Is this how you want to live the rest of your lives? Please ask her AND yourself that question, and if the answer is no and you want to have a better life, then please actually do what is necessary.\n\nI don't want to armchair diagnose your girlfriend and say she is abusive or a narcissist, but I do think her behavior is very concerning, even if it's sporadic as I said previously. I'm not telling you to dump her, but over the years her behavior is going to become so exhausting that you might not be able to put up with it anymore, and it's not magically going to improve without any effort on her part (and no amount of effort on yours can change her).

I, however, haven\u2019t done the things to my husband that she did to you. I trust his judgement and his opinion, since I know he does his research. I can get very anxious about changing places (for holidays, for example). I get snappy, shut down and am not a happy camper until we changed places and have created a new routine. \n\nI suspect that she is having the same anxious issue. She should keep working on it, talking negatively to your SO, being indifferent about important life choices and then get mad at you for making the decision, is plain rude. Anxiety and depression are a struggle but the moment you lash out to your SO and you lash out in a mean way and cannot take responsibility / properly apologise for hurting your SO, you are a dick. \n\nOP, if she isn\u2019t working on the lashing out onto you problem and if that is not improving, don\u2019t keep putting up with that.

Take the example of someone who gets wasted at a party and says some questionable things, then calls back to apologize.\n\n* If they blamed it on the alcohol, would you find that to be a valid excuse? I don't remember ever saying something hurtful because of liquor, and most of the people I know don't do this, but jerks tend to reveal themselves more when they drink. So it's not the alcohol, but blaming alcohol is a convenient device\n* If they told you they were in a bad place, and wrong about their perception, you would have to weigh whether they really feel they were wrong, or whether they're just saying they were wrong to keep the peace.\n\nYou have the right to be with someone who will not treat you poorly, even when they're having a hard time. The \"*I'm not feeling well, let me lash out*\" is a horrible excuse. You want to start a family with someone like this?

I tried therapy and although I didn\u2019t find it particularly helpful for different reasons, I knew I needed some help to get out of my pit so I started taking anti-depressants, that did help me a lot during that time.\n\nThe behaviour you have mentioned sounds a lot like bi-polar disorder, and if that\u2019s the case, your gf will need not only therapy but meds to really help her. \n\nI am afraid she might not want to get help as she may not want to have that label put on her/take meds.

They were loving, and I loved them, but I let my knowledge of their past be an excuse for their behaviour and it took me a really long time to see that, in their own attempt to protect themselves from abuse, they had developed coping strategies that turned them into an abuser. \n\nI hope that either your partner can get the help that she needs to recover and stop treating you this way, or that you can find a safe way out of the relationship.", "Dude get out while you can.
