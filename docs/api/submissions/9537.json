It's only fair. You're the manager, you don't have time to execute, you're busy orchestrating the overall project and tracking tasks to timeline and working on future sprint planning. So you can give him a task list daily but then he's on his own to actually execute those tasks.\n\nOr he can figure out a system to track and organize his own workload like an adult.

All she had to do was go to work and occasionally do a bit of cleaning on the weekend.\n\nHonestly it really spoiled me for guys in the real world, because I was raised to expect this as normal and it's very much not normal, even for modern feminist guys who THINK they contribute equally.", "60% of the job 200% of the credits", "I am so much happier alone hahaha", "The number of times my brother was like \"I don't know how to do it!\"\n\nThe instructions are on the bottle you halfwit", "Some of these commenters I swear.
