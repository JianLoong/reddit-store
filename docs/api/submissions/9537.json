I doubt crackers were always exclusively savoury (and clearly, they still aren\u2019t,) it\u2019s just that now people tend to eat crackers in certain settings - with cheese or hummus or whatever - so most of the time when someone wants a cracker they want it for a savoury purpose.

He doesn\u2019t need to \u201cdo better\u201d as a dad ffs. Him and his wife need to improve their communication skills.\n\nETA: I agree. He\u2019s far from a shit dad. Glad you could admit that. Funny to see you have nothing to add about your asinine insinuation that I shouldn\u2019t have received my CJ degree just because I classify animal crackers as crackers though."]}
