We wanted to save some money on child care and decided to ask for my MIL (50F) for help. We asked her to stay with us for a month since I work from home but will transition to in person soon. We flew her and my SIL (11F) and have provided whatever they need (as we should). \n\nEverything was smooth sailing until today. My husband ordered pizza for dinner and when my MIL told my SIL to eat, she responded that she wasn\u2019t hungry yet. I said \u201cThat\u2019s fine, eat whenever. It\u2019s not like the food is going anywhere.\u201d An hour or so later, my MIL decides to take a shower and stay in the guest room which I found odd because we spend evenings all of us together. I figured she was feeling ill since she has had stomach problems for the last few days. So, I tell my husband to check up on her and to make sure she\u2019s alright.\n\nTo my surprise, my husband tells me that my MIL was offended by what I said. Apparently my SIL gave me a certain look, and I supposedly said the quote above as if I was complaining about how much my SIL eats. I was shocked, I told my husband I meant it as in the food would literally not grow legs and leave. He said that he knew I wouldn\u2019t say it like that and that he told my MIL that it was a misunderstanding and that I said it jokingly.\n\nSome time later, my husband asked me if I was ok and I told him the truth, that I was annoyed. He asked me to talk to my MIL to clear the misunderstanding and not act like I knew nothing. I refused, I told him that she should approach me if she\u2019s bothered by what I said. I told him that I\u2019ve been wronged by her in the past many times and never once has she approached me to solve anything, we just carry on like nothing happened. He responded that he knows I\u2019m the bigger person and should therefore act like it. \n\nMy biggest issue is that my MIL is not a very reasonable person and I anticipate that I will have to apologize even though I did nothing wrong. This just makes my blood boil.

Count this situation as a blessing as well as a portent of things to come. Do not enlist her help in taking care of your child because things will only get messier. Quickly and thoroughly look for another childcare option. Tell your husband that while you respect his opinion you are entitled to your opinion as well. Let him know that you feel this incident is a blessing in disguise because you now see she is not a viable candidate for childcare. I am willing to bet that he will back and may even tell her how you feel. I bet she will then jump off her high horse. I just hope she doesn\u2019t fall on her butt (Lol).

To be clear, it\u2019s not that I\u2019ll automatically be apologizing. It\u2019s that my MIL is not the most logical person, so I expect that even if I explain what I meant to her, it won\u2019t be enough to keep the peace.

We could cover her flights but not housing. And it would be unfair to ask her to pay lodging somewhere for herself so she could take care of our baby, that would be very entitled.

And here\u2019s the thing, I never have any issues with things she does because we all have our quirks. But somehow she always has something to say about me (or about my family). When baby was just born, she heard my mom (while we were on video call) talk badly about her. What\u2019s funny is that my mom didn\u2019t even mention her in our entire conversation. And it\u2019s like she creates situations that aren\u2019t even there. \n\nI\u2019m ready to find other childcare options. Though I hope it won\u2019t come that. Not because of the money (we can afford childcare) but because I genuinely want her to spend time with her first grandchild.\n\nEdit: She won\u2019t get to spend time with our baby outside of this time now (except for video calls). Because my husbands and my family lives in the same state (nearby towns), there\u2019s always drama when we visit (guess who causes it). We always end up needing a vacation from the vacation. So, we\u2019ve decided not to go back and visit for a few years, and travel elsewhere.", "You gave birth recently. You had a huge medical event in your sleep and your hormones are impacted. And yes, she is helping.

And I mean that in a non-judgmental way, you have to decide what you prefer!", ">Nobody does that anymore. Communication is a lost art.\n\nOh, come on. Nothing new here, humans have always been like this. Name an era in history where there was \"good communication\" between humans.", "I understand where you are coming from. I want my kids to have a good relationship with their grandparents but so far they have all been more interested in creating drama than anything else. Currently giving my MIL a chance as well. Hopefully this works out for us both! I agree that it\u2019s nice for kids to be close with their grandparents."]}
