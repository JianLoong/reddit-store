When I raise we've got a few dietary requirements to consider Stacey agrees the no tomato thing will be a bit limiting, but is still encouraging saying \"half of us are gluten free, most things these days are vegetarian and how hard is it just not to eat a potato?\"  \n I explain that potato is often used as a filler or an ingredient and you need to check for it.\n\nWe decide to go ahead.\n\nMonday Stacey makes potato bake with salad. She seems surprised I won't even try the potato bake, and doesn't seem to really get that being allergic to potatoes means I can't eat potato bake even if it's \"organic\" \"gluten free\" \"home made\" and \"really yummy. The salad is literally just lettuce and cucumber without dressing.\n\nTuesday Meg makes crumbed fish and chips of the \"buy in a bag and chuck it in the oven variety.\" She remembered the no potato thing and got some microwaveable vegetables for me instead of chips, but when I asked her if the fish contained potato I got a blank stare and a \"uh... it's fish, the box said gluten free?\" So I fished the box out of the bin and it contained potato flakes. I remind everyone again about checking ingredients.\n\nWednesday Hannah makes gluten free pasta bake. It's not a tomato based sauce. I ask if she's checked the ingredients of the gluten free pasta and... nope. It has potato. There is literally only two ingredients in this pasta, chickpea and potato. She feels really bad and offers to make me something else, but I say it's fine and I'll just have cereal.\n\nBut, it really isn't fine, because I haven't really had a meal any night. Individually, everything was understandable, but three nights in a row was just too much. So Thursday morning I message everyone saying it's not working out, I don't want to do the meal share and I won't be cooking that night.

Trying to cook together when the three of you all have different dietary restrictions is just unlikely to work out. \n\nPurely for your comfort and benefit though, if you want to maintain a good relationship with them given that you are house mates and are bound to interact at least until your lease is up, I would suggest perhaps cook a low-effort meal to \u201cmake up\u201d for your turn, and involve them in making sure everyone\u2019s dietary restrictions (especially yours) are being met.

So I check the ingredients rigorously, to make sure there is no soy (the upside is that I usually make things from scratch, which is a lot healthier). \n\nOne other frequent guest is a (I don\u2019t know the word, they don\u2019t eat mammals but will eat poultry and seafood), and so if I\u2019m barbecuing, I always make sure there\u2019s an option for them. \n\nAnother one has tomato issues, but can handle red sauce in limited amounts, so I control for that. \n\nAnd an infrequent guest is full vegan, so I actually make them RSVP for real, if I\u2019m preparing something specific for them. \n\n\nYou told them your dietary issues ahead of time, they either ignored it, or weren\u2019t rigorous in checking the ingredients.

Anyway, to reiterate, NTA. Cooking to satisfy all of your allergies and tastes every night would be way too expensive and way too restrictive and I'm sure you would all quickly become bored of your limited options anyway.", "If your ok eatting gluten maybe you can bring in something with gluten and say they can have that as thats essentially what they did to you and at least unlike them you were kind enough to tell them. After all its still really yummy. \n\nOn the other hand this will cause more issues. Your roommates are big inconsiderate jerks. Id not cook for them either. They clearly don't take your allergy seriously and her trying to push you to eat it anyways has me worried she may try to sneak it in to prove a point. If this is a allergy with a serious reaction your life could be on the line. Id not trust them ever again and Id be blunt in why: disrespect and disregard for your dietary restrictions. They didn't hold up their end and you got to go hungry for 3 days cause of that and yet want you to put in work, money, and time for them. No.", ">She said \"gluten free is easy because it says it on the box, but having to read ingredients isn't normal.\"\n\nI dont know where you live, but unless its specifically in the gluten free section, you usually have to check the ingredients. My friend is gluten free and I have no issues just glancing at the ingredients. It isn't hard. She's just making excuses because she was too daft to check. \n\n>Hannah gets it, but thinks I should have given everyone a second chance\n\nThey got three chances.\n\nPoint out that Stacey served you straight up potato and still doesn't understand why that is an issue. That even when you showed how important it was to check the ingredients on Meg's night, you still encountered the same issue the next night. This is your health at risk and if you had not been vigilant, that's two times you could have been potentially made ill (I'm not including Stacey's meal since that didn't require vigilance to avoid. You have eyes. That is clearly potato.) So you can't trust Stacey to understand your allergy at all and Hannah has outright stated she sees looking at the ingredients \"isn't normal\" and is just making excuses instead of saying \"my bad, didn't think to check. I'll bear that in mind from now on\". So clearly, this whole thing is not working out for you. \n\nAsk them how they'd feel if you just kept serving them gluten and said \"oh checking the box is a hassle\".\n\nAs for cooking on your night, why would you cook for them and help them \"save money\" as you've not saved any money as you've been unable to eat what they've cooked. \n\n\nHonestly, I can't believe how hopeless it's been for you. My partner doesn't eat much potato, so I try a lot to think of alternative sides like onion rings, carrot fries or mash, sweet potato fries, swede, rice, etc. And then they just have to check the ingredients.

The only guarantee is certified gluten free. Your friends are young and stupid.

Frame it like this; say that you gave it a shot but it\u2019s three strikes in a row and you don\u2019t want it to be a constant source of conflict in your apartment, so you think it\u2019s easier that you just cook for yourself.

So weird...\"", "And be sure to make something that _clearly_ has gluten in it. Like... pasta.
