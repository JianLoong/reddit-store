I remind everyone again about checking ingredients.\n\nWednesday Hannah makes gluten free pasta bake. It's not a tomato based sauce. I ask if she's checked the ingredients of the gluten free pasta and... nope. It has potato. There is literally only two ingredients in this pasta, chickpea and potato. She feels really bad and offers to make me something else, but I say it's fine and I'll just have cereal.\n\nBut, it really isn't fine, because I haven't really had a meal any night.

Trying to cook together when the three of you all have different dietary restrictions is just unlikely to work out. \n\nPurely for your comfort and benefit though, if you want to maintain a good relationship with them given that you are house mates and are bound to interact at least until your lease is up, I would suggest perhaps cook a low-effort meal to \u201cmake up\u201d for your turn, and involve them in making sure everyone\u2019s dietary restrictions (especially yours) are being met.
