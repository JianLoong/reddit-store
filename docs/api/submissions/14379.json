Yesterday my husband couldn\u2019t go to the grocery store and I had to do it. \n\nThe grocery store I went to had one of the aforementioned parking spots free and I parked there. As I was getting out a man pulled up behind me and started yelling at me telling me it was illegal to park there it\u2019s for veterans. \n\nI told him it was for veterans and pregnant women, and I was a pregnant woman. He said he earned the right to park there by fighting for our country. I apologized that he felt that way and I was grateful for his service, and if he needs the spot for disability reasons there are plenty of spots open.\n\nSome detail: he was a young dude, and of course I don\u2019t know if he was disabled or not, he was in his car and I couldn\u2019t see him, as well as not all disabilities are visible. \n\nHe called me a bitch and drove away, and when I told my husband about the interaction he told me while it did say for pregnant women and veterans, he deserved it more and I should have backed off.

I\u2019d be having a looooonnnnngggg talk with my husband if he shamed me for using a spot designated for me while pregnant. I would describe every symptom I\u2019ve experienced thus far in great detail. I\u2019d look into one of those devices you can attach to their stomachs to simulate birthing pain so he can get a glimpse of what is to come. I would make his life Hell. \n\nLike, you notice how it\u2019s only the men shaming you, right??? Men who have never had to face the trials of pregnancy? Gross.", "NTA - it was meant for pregnant women AND veterans. You were there first, so you can use it. Bad luck for the guy.", "NTA. Parking spots for pregnant people are about need, not who deserves it more. You needed it. You were right to use it. Your husband sounds like he does not have a good idea about how challenging the third trimester is. You should suggest he read up on it because he is sounding like TA here (the veteran too, obviously).", "NTA. Never heard of a \"pregnant and veterans\" spot. If someone gets disabled in serving in the military, they can get a disability tag. A pregnancy and mothers of small children spot is basically for someone facing temporary physical disability or someone who needs extra space for unloading strollers. A pregnancy and veterans spot is silly because it groups together people who actually need to reduce their walking distance or need the extra space with people who are getting prime spots for the same reason places give discounts-- which isn't based on need \"need\".", "NTA. That guy most certainly was. My partner is  vet, and he would gladly give up one of those parking spots to a pregnant person. Besides, who's to say you aren't a veteran? Did the guy assume you were not simply because you are a pregnant person? Some of the most badass vets I know identify as women. \n\nThat a-hole can go kick rocks.\n\nEdit: Your husband, dad, and brother are AH for being okay with a stranger calling you a bitch.", "NTA. It was for pregnant people and veterans. How is it he deserved it more? That whole notion that any veteran deserves it more than a woman having a rough pregnancy and 34 weeks along when you basically  have a bowling ball sitting on your bladder all day....maybe he  was a company clerk and rode a desk in the US for four years. How do they know?  I have a friend who did just that. Never got anywhere near a gun fired in anger. Hell, I know a guy who got discharged for failure to adapt to military life and he insists on wearing an army cap and using those parking spaces, and he didn't last six months in the army. Screw the men. Park and don't feel guilty.", "NTA.  You were there first and with your rights to park. \n\nThe veteran, hubby and others are jerks.", "NTA.\n\nThe spirit of those spots is generally with the idea that it is specifically for veterans injured in combat. But him saying he \"deserved it more\" leaves a bad taste in my mouth. IMO, the point of joining the service is for the sake of your country and fight for your people, not get a better parking spot or a discount at Denny's.\n\nMy daddy was a career military man. Not only would he have parked elsewhere without a huff, he would have returned to you and offered you his arm into the grocery store if it looked like you were struggling.\n\nI'm not saying veterans don't have a right to be pissed, but this guy just reminds me of a buddy I went to school with who got a dishonorable discharge 2-years in for fucking around and shooting himself in the foot. But he still wears his uniform around.\n\n**Edit:** typos", "NTA.\nThis is bullshit. First of all, it's for pregnant people, too. The veteran can take it up with the people who make the signs.\nSecond of all, women no longer get to choose to be pregnant anymore in the U.S. I recognize that many do, and you probably did as well, but the man, your brother, and your husband need a reality check.\n\n\"I know we have bodily autonomy and you don't. But how dare you take a parking spot that's partly meant for you?!?!\"", "NTA your sister is right. Every single man in this story is a giant asshole fuck them. Obligatory this is a big red flag for how his family is going to treat you the rest of your life.", "NTA. The spot is allowed to be taken by pregnant people and that\u2019s you.", "NTA. Part of the problem here is that men don't get pregnant so they don't know just how hard it can be to move around and run errands with a big belly in front. Hubby, dad, brother, *and* vet are all wrong.", "NTA.\n\nIt says it's for pregnant people and veterans. That last trimester suuuuuucks. Use that parking spot.", "NTA. But you did meet one.", "NTA, but I don't know why you bothered engaging any more than just pointing to the sign and your stomach. A person like that isn't reasonable.", "NTA\n\nIt says that it is for veterans AND pregnant people and you are pregnant - dude got there AFTER you did.", "NTA, You\u2019re in a rough pregnancy and you need to put yourself and baby first so that you\u2019re both healthy in the end, and you did. You said there were plenty of spots open, so you didn\u2019t take anyones chance of having a spot", "NTA.\n\nHe didn't deserve the parking spot anymore than you did, he's just an entitled asshole considering there were a multitude of other available parking spaces.", "NTA. You parked in a spot designated for pregnant people. That dude your father and brother ATAHs", "NTA. You're pregnant, you can park there. He's forgotten everything he learned about ethics and morals, and is unworthy of calling himself a veteran.", "NTA. If it's for both purposes (veterans and expecting women,) it's for both purposes and you're okay using it as needed. The salty guy was being an entitled asshole, and your husband's 'deserve it more' is bullshit.", "NTA.\n\nBeing a veteran does not make one more deserving of a parking spot than a pregnant woman. No way in hell. Were he to be disabled, he would have a plaque or disabled tags and could park in a handicapped spot, so that point is moot. Being an able-bodied vet doesn't give him preference over pregnant customers.", "NTA. He deserved it more, man gimme a break. You're 34 weeks pregnant! You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - you are pregnant, the spot is meant for people who are pregnant.\n\nThe fact OP's significant other backed up a random stranger more than his own partner is a little concerning. Same with father and brother backing a random stranger more than family.\n\nNo negativity toward war veterans as a general. This particular WV, SO, Dad, Brother could all handled the situation better.", "I read this one to my husband who is Marine Corps veteran and he said you are absolutely not the asshole. He thinks that man was out of line and you deserved to park there too!", "OMG - your husband actually sided with that nasty vet?!? You are NTA here - but that guy and your husband are! \n\nVet spots are there as a courtesy to veterans. Pregnancy spots are there because pregnancy makes it difficult to walk around for any length of time. Pregnancy trumps veteran status. If he was a disabled vet, he can park in a handicap spot, which are generally even closer.\n\nYou were absolutely right to park there. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA! Goodness the men in your family should be more respectful to you! You did nothing wrong but now you know where you rank with your husband, father, and brother. \n\nThe vet was out of line and disrespectful but it\u2019s Seriously disturbing how callously your male family members reacted toward you. They\u2019re worse than the Vet. \n\nThey should have your back!", "NTA. Jesus. First of all, how did the guy know you weren\u2019t a veteran? His assumption says a lot about him. Secondly, the whole vet parking space thing in the US makes me laugh. My husband served in Iraq and Afghanistan and he wouldn\u2019t dream of even parking in such a space if we had them here (UK). The guy may be a vet, but that doesn\u2019t stop him being a huge AH. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your rough pregnancy, I hope you feel better soon.", "NTA. This is just another example of males shitting on women for no reason. Your husband included. You\u2019re pregnant and you\u2019re entitled to that spot too. \n\nKick your husband in the balls for what he said.", "He didn\u2019t deserve shit.\n\nNTA, you used the parking spot precisely for what it was designed: pregnant women. \n\nYour husband, dad, and brother are full of shit about this. Don\u2019t pay them or the (alleged) vet any mind. You\u2019re 34 weeks pregnant honey, insecure men don\u2019t deserve a second\u2019s thought in your mind. Just focus on being happy and relaxed, it\u2019s good for you and your baby", "NTA.\n\nAll confronting someone about a parking spot is usually an AH move. In most states offer handicap placards for pregnant people anyway. Your location has pregnant parking and since you are pregnant there's nothing to worry about.", "NTA.  You are pregnant, you are just as entitled to use it as he is.  He shouldn't have yelled at you.", "NTA. The dude and your male family members are being dicks. It\u2019s not a handicapped spot ffs.  And the guy who assumed you weren\u2019t a veteran is doubly TA.", "NTA. It\u2019s for pregnant people. You\u2019re a pregnant person. That guy can F right off. \n\nAlso, the men in your life don\u2019t get to decide who \u2018deserves it more\u2019. I\u2019m sure if they had to carry and birth a child, they would have a different opinion.", "nta, technically both are activites which risk your life. that said at 34 weeks the mother is going to be pretty large with swollen feet and pains etc. so yeah OP had more right to the spot any way you look at it. if the guy had had an injury which meant he \"needed\" it then he would also qualify fir disabled parking. \n\nno other country understands the US veteran thing,", "NTA\n\nThose are not legally enforced so he is wrong. Your dad and brother are dumb. Parking except for disabled parking is first come first serve.", "NTA\n\nIf it is a parking spot reserved for pregnant individuals and veterans, and you are pregnant, then you are as entitled to that parking spot as any veteran. Plain and simple.", "NTA.", "NTA and I doubt it is the law, I think it is just store policy.", "NTA, there were other empty sports, dude just wanted to pick a fight with a pregnant woman because, idk, testosterone? Pretty dick move on his part so I wouldn't worry about what he said.", "NTA - you were entitled to park there and you got there first. Simple as that. That guy was just bitter you got the spot. Nothing you should worry about. Not sure why your husband didn\u2019t agree with you since you were completely within your right to park there.", "NTA. And how would he know you're not pregnant AND a veteran anyway? These spots aren't about \"who needs it more\" - it's first come, first served. In fact, even if it were a handicapped spot, if you both had a placard, you were still there first. He was no more entitled to the spot than you were.", "NTA but your husband might be!", "NTA\n\nIs this dude even a veteran?", "NTA . I can\u2019t believe your family said he deserved it more. I mean I guess I can since it appears it was only the people who can\u2019t get pregnant that said he deserved it more. That\u2019s insane to me. You definitely should be free to use pregnancy parking spots, even if it is also for veterans. If the spot is open and you are pregnant, then it\u2019s yours!", "NTA you quite literally did nothing wrong. You parked in a parking spot designated for someone like you. That's why it's there. No one \"deserves it more\" if it's taken it's taken. And from my understanding it seemed like you were leaving, so dude could've just drove around the lot and came back to get it once you left. You didn't do anything wrong, and those folks saying you did have their priorities very wrong.", "NTA.\n\nYou met the requirements of the parking spot and you *got there first.* The individual you encountered was an AH for confronting you over it & for calling you a bitch when you didn\u2019t let him bully you into giving him your spot.\n\nYour husband, dad, and brother are *also* assholes for siding with the stranger who yelled at and insulted their wife/daughter/sibling.\n\nEdit: word", "Yeah of course your husband, brother and father who have never been and will never be pregnant would agree with the asshole. There\u2019s a reason they provide those spots for pregnant women. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I once accidentally parked in a veteran's spot and was accosted by a man asking if I did service. I didn't realize, apologized, and headed on with my life.\n\nBut it bothered me because I was new to the south. I asked an veteran friend what she thought. She laughed. \"Women have been in the military for over a century, would he have asked a man this? Also, ex military dosen't mean disabled, there are spots for that. We get a lot of appreciation, he'll be fine.\" The spots are not really legally enforcable, like disability spots are.\n\nKind of a weird flex, veteran vs. pregnant. Both get respect, but does one deserve more than the other? Honestly, the armed forces get SO MANY benefits that are not available to civilians, like banking, home insurance, access to credit cards and airport lounges, I think he'll be ok walking a little further.\n\nI just wish your family was more supportive. At least know you know where you are on their social pecking order. Uncomfortable, pregnant woman they know and love is ranked lower than angry stranger claiming valor. My condolences.", "NTA\nYou are pregnant and had just as much right to park there.  Why would that guy deserve it more?? First come, first serve.\n\nNote: I am not from the US. The whole veteran veneration is not something we do/have where I am from and always sound so odd to me. So that may skew my judgement.", "NTA - why is your husband siding with some rude abusive random person?", "E-S-H \n\n>Parking spots for veterans and pregnant individuals\n\nWell, obviously that means only pregnant veterans should park there. Lol\n\nBut assuming that they mean either/or than you absolutely has a right to park there. And the spot is first come. \n\nThose are courtesy spots. And they're not assigned by some sort of ranking as to who gets it. \n\nI think the men in your life need to have a little pregnancy simulator so they have a better understanding as to why pregnant women need close spots. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf the guy had a mobility impairment he would qualify for a handicapped parking permit. He was just asking for special treatment because of his military service.\n\nThe fetishization of military service is a bad thing in our society.", "~~ESH (except you and your sister).~~ \n\nNTA, but everyone else except your sister = AH.\n\nIt's a *huge* red flag that your husband isn't supporting you here. What functional husband doesn't prioritize his pregnant wife over a random man in a parking lot??  Especially for a spot that isn't for disability access.\n\nYour brother and father don't prioritize you, either, which is also gross.\n\nI'm sorry that dude yelled at you in the parking lot, but his feelings are not your problem.\n\nAnd if anyone here actually cares about veterans (or is worried that they were an AH), all four of you would call up your representative's office tomorrow and ask them to do more to support veterans and to fund mental health care.\n\nI don't know where you live, but it sounds like a terrible place and I'm sorry.", "Those spots are utterly ridiculous.", "NTA. I am grateful to veterans for their service! But why on earth would they need specific parking?

Veteran parking is not a thing in the Europe. Family / pregnant women parking is. Goes to show who actually needs the spot...", "NTA.

If you expect special treatment, then you didn't really serve the country, you served yourself.", "No one was ah. If she wasnt going out much and isnt a complainer then I'm sure the men in her life thought she was more than capable of walking a little further than a vet or active member who might be in physical need to walk less of a distance.
