You are 100% NTA here, and I'm glad you're standing up for the kids. There's no reason why your sister shouldn't be dating. But moving 3 people - including a baby - in is an enormous change to everybody's lives and shouldn't have been done so blatantly over the kids' objections. And then she punishes them for not being happy about it? No. If this was a relationship she saw moving towards marriage she should have taken the time to get everybody used to each other and build those relationships before moving in together was even on the table. Blended families don't all have to love each other - especially when their blending this late in childhood - but they do at least have to all be open to building relationships. Your sister rushed into this with no regard for her kids and that is selfish.", "NTA I get her wanting to get married, but this is her daughters home and family too. Why not spend some time letting them develop a rapport at their own pace? If this relationship is for ever, surely 3,4 or 5 years spent developing their relationship is worth it. If Zach has a 1 year old i would assume this relationship isn\u2019t longer than a year old? Why is there a rush to force teenagers into a situation they clearly aren\u2019t happy about", "INFO: Does Zach ever have to babysit, or only the girls?\n\nEdit: saw in another comment that he does not. Regardless, I still say NTA. You voiced your opinion, sounds like she is just defensive because she knows it's not fair to the girls, she just doesn't much care.", "INFO - is there a reason the daughters don\u2019t like Zach?  Did he do something wrong?  Or is just not wanting a boy in the house?", "NTA. Because this woman got engaged when this man got another woman pregnant? You say they were engaged for one month. This woman is not acting like a mother responsible for her two children - she is making poor decisions. Of course her children don\u2019t like it, their mother is moving fast with a man and now their lives are thrown upside down and there\u2019s a baby in the mix.", "NTA this is a huge change for her kids and more responsibility for them, and their mom seems to have the attitude of \u201cthey should suffer so I can be happy,\u201d without acknowledging her daughters complaints. Guess who isn\u2019t going to be involved in her kids lives once they can get out?", "This sounds like a bad idea in general. They got engaged a year ago but he has a one year old. NTA and Ally is going to make your sister regret it. \n\n>She also refuses to take a nice photo with Zach.\n\nAnd? Your sister needs a reality check. Be prepared for Ally to show up on your doorstep.\n\nThis is way worse than I thought. The five year old shares a room with the fourteen year old and the baby is in the living room. Did your sister think any of this through for an entire second? Oh and the girls have to babysit but the boy doesn't. What a surprise.", "NTA. As a parent your First priority is providing the basic necessary resources for survival. Such as a home where they feel safe and reasonably comfortable.   Your sister have let her kids safe space been invaded. \n\nYour second is their mental health, also known as basic happiness.   Your sister but her wants over her children\u2019s happiness.\n\nYou should also provide freedom of childhood, which your sister is stealing by forcing her kids to look after their younger sister and your sisters step kids.(I\u2019m not calling them step siblings because your nieces Clearly don\u2019t see them as anything like family step or otherwise)", "INFO\n\nWhy on earth did your sister marry a man with a baby?! Like what in the world\n\n\nOk I don't really need info...NTA", "NTA. Your sister asked your opinion and you gave it. Based solely on your story, I don\u2019t agree with your judgement of your sister but as long as you aren\u2019t saying it to the kids, you\u2019re not an asshole. It seems your sister doesn\u2019t trust that you won\u2019t say it to the kids though, so that\u2019s interesting.", "NTA I can't believe some of the votes on this thread. A parent has a responsibility to their children and that includes making sure their children are comfortable with any new people coming into the home. A good parent doesn't move new people plus a baby into the home within months. Any relationship with children involved should move slowly because the two adults aren't the only ones in the relationship. They're blending lives and that takes time. Your sister moved too fast. She **was** being a little selfish. She can have a relationship with him while being in separate homes.", "NTA\n\nBella doesn't want to hear that she rushed things. She wants everyone to hash out their issues and become a loving family like a 30 minute episode of The Brady Bunch. \n\nReality is going to hurt her feelings. She best get a handle on this situation or the resentments will fester.", "So Bella met Henry and was engaged quickly to a man with a newborn who\u2019s baby\u2019s mom was in jail. After a month they got married, took off for a month leaving the then 14,13, and 4 yr old alone for the time. Once returned Henry, Zach, and the baby moved into the home and Bella started pestering the girls to babysit the youngest sister and the baby. \n\n\nAlly complained because Zach is a teenage boy she doesn\u2019t know constantly in her face and she did not sign up to be a caregiver for a baby. Bella is punishing her now, and OP you defended Ally and Katy. In doing so you told your sister she was selfish for the rushed relationship and putting her own need to get regular Dick above her kid\u2019s happiness and security.\n\n\nDid I get that right?\n\n\nNTA \n\nYour sister IS selfish. I dated plenty in the years after ending my relationship with my kids biodad. None of my BFs met my kids til months in. My kids also already knew and were attached to my husband BEFORE we started dating because he was a good family friend for almost 2 years (regular game nights with my friends and their friends), and I ASKED their permission before agreeing to date my husband, get engaged, move him in, and marry him.  The fact that your sister didn\u2019t allow the kids to get to know Henry and his kids before becoming engaged is a \ud83d\udea9 the quick engagement and wedding is a \ud83d\udea9 the long honeymoon is a \ud83d\udea9the teenage son\u2019s behavior can be a yellow flag because horny teenage boy all up on a teenage girl in a house with a no lock door policy can go very very wrong. \n\nYour sister will probably be facing a world of legal and financial troubles because she literally cannot know who this man and his kids are that quickly. He could be a narcissist is the love bomb stage and ruin her life. He could be a criminal and got his ex in trouble hence the jail. No one goes from dating to pregnant to in jail quickly enough that this timeline makes sense.\n\n\nHenry must have the best dick for your sister to be this naive unless she is always this naive.", "'A year ago they got engaged' yet he has a 1year old child?

NTA and bet the nieces wish they could move in with you or their father.", "NTA, your sister is selfish and didn't consider her daughter's needs before moving people into their home. She should have waited until they at least got to know each other. The home isn't big enough for that many people. A 5 yo shouldn't have to share with a teenager and a baby shouldn't be in the living room. \n\nIf Bella won't let you talk to the kids you should apologize to keep the peace and maintain contact with the girls. They need a safe space to vent and in case there are bigger problems with Zach or stepdad.", "NTA. When you have kids under 18, they have to come first. Your love life comes second.

You can obviously have a new partner with kids but you can't let it negatively impact their lives.", "Honestly NTA.

Just focus on the kids and their welfare - don't bring her relationship into it unless the guy has done something wrong to them.

This makes me wonder about this guy she married.  How long is she in prison for?  Will she take her baby back later on?

Being expected to get my brother up for school every morning, feed us both, get us to school, get us home for lunch and feed us, get us back to school, make sure we both got out homework done, etc was parentification. Parentification isn't about the age, it's about the amount of work being expected and the lack of consent. Taking care of other kids for money was great. I only did it for a few hours at a time, only when I wanted to, and I got money. Being expected to be my brother's mother was not great.
