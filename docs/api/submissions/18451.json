{"id": 18451, "submission_id": "13uof1y", "title": "AITA for telling the guy my mom is divorcing to focus on his kid and stop trying to pawn her off?", "selftext": "My mom got married to Henry in January 2020. He had just gotten divorced for the second time when he met my mom and my mom had been widowered for 4 years (my dad died when I was still pretty young). Henry had kids from both his marriages. He had 3 or 2 from the first one. I never met them. They were older. He had Vivienne from his second marriage and she was 5 at the time. Henry's ex-wife was not in Vivienne's life then or now. The BG from what I got is that both were divorced and remarried but their kids were not happy and Vivienne was a surprise baby that pushed both their kids away from them. None wanted Vivienne to be their sister. So Henry's ex decided she needed to focus on her older kids and Henry ended up with full custody.\n\nHe was desperately trying to not step up for Vivienne. I think he honestly regretted having her and resented her for being born but didn't want to be that guy so he tried to make up for everyone abandoning her. He married my mom and tried to push her off on her. But my mom is a nurse and during the worst of our stay in place order my mom was out of the house until very late and stayed in a little apartment attached to our house, that we usually use for guests. So he was home with us and he'd often try to pawn Vivienne off on me. I never let that happen and nothing changed after things opened up. My mom did spend some time with her when she could.\n\nThe marriage was not good and then they separated a while ago. Henry asked if my mom wanted to keep Vivienne and she said no. He then told me that just because he and my mom are divorcing, doesn't mean me and Vivienne can't stay sisters. I told him we were never sisters. He said we were and that she saw me more than her bio siblings. When I still didn't budge he told me that somebody has to want her or she's going to be fucked up. I asked him why that can't be him. He said he does want her but that more people need to. That she is aware she has siblings who don't want her and I could be different. I could be the one who stays even though I don't have to. I told him that would not be me and he needs to accept it. He then told me he can't do it alone because she's going to realize sooner or later that she was a mistake.\n\nI snapped at that point because it proved my point that he just wanted someone to ease his guilty conscience. I told him to focus on his kid and stop trying to pawn her off because she sees that and it will make her realize way quicker than if he just does what he needs to as a dad for her.\n\nHe called me spoiled and said I was shaming him for trying to care for his daughter. I thought it was crazy but then mom was like I went too far and he had a point that I could have a sister if I wanted one and could really benefit her life. But that saying that to her ex was not going to make things any better for anyone.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to fix typo.", "created_utc": 1685346945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uof1y/aita_for_telling_the_guy_my_mom_is_divorcing_to/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You hit the nail right on the head with your comments when you snapped at him.  \n\nAlso, if your mother cared, then SHE can step up, as Vivienne would be \"her\" daughter.  I wonder how much of your mom's response is her guilt for making such a poor choice as to be involved with Henry in the first place.", "NTA\n\nThat poor child! At this point she\u2019s be better off being adopted by someone who will care about her. No one else seems to. Poor kid.", "NTA. Your mum is wrong - your comment was perfect. Anything that can be said about your relationship with Vivienne applies to her too. So pot/kettle/black applies too.\n\nHenry is unworthy of fatherhood", "Omg, my heart breaks for the poor baby! NTA. Sure, she needs someone to show her love, but it is NOT your responsibility. You are 100% correct when you say that he needs to step up.", "Info : why do you listen to anything your mom says ? She married a deadbeat dad and left you to deal with him, and divorced him when life came back to normal ?", "I feel so sorry for that little girl!!!", "Your mom is an asshole for dragging this asshole into your life and then trying to guilt trip you into any of this. It has nothing to do with you. Your mom can be in her life. He's calling you names. Forget him. NTA.", "NTA, that poor kid. Imagine knowing you're not wanted by literally anyone at 5 years old. Beyond cruel.", "NTA, but wow your mom's ex-husband is! He admits he doesn't want his own daughter but you're supposed to so she doesn't get messed up? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. It sounds like you were never close before.  No need or obligation to create a relationship now.", "NTA. I assume you're a kid yourself. You do not have to take responsibility for other people's lives or mistakes. He's being entitled. Good luck!", "NTA.  It is a sad commentary on modern life.  These days, the typical divorce drama is not over who gets to keep the kids, but rather it's a fight to make the OTHER side take the kids...\n\nI feel so sad for Vivienne.

Which is totally fair. \n\nBUT this leaves us with two options:\n\n1 kid is badly neglected or\n\n2 he is actually caring for her and just wanted someone else to show some love for his daughter once in a while. \n\nIf 1 is true, call CPS right now. That kid deserves better.\n\nIf 2, then YTA big time.\n\nETA: they married in Jan 2023 and separated a few months ago??

As opposed to when women were effectively sold by their families to their husbands for a dowry, had no right to own property and their sole value was in having male babies? Where the child was considered property of the father and if the mother dared leave no matter how abusive the father, she would lose everything and never see her children again. If the kids were born into wealth they'd be looked after by servants, and if they were born into poverty they'd be illiterate and working long before they were 10, assuming they survived that long, as many died under the age of 5. When kids were sent to abusive boarding schools where they were beaten and huge numbers died of infectious disease? Those halcyon days, you mean? \n\nFamilial dysfunction wasn't invented the day women were allowed to divorce their husbands.", "That was meant to be 2020. Sorry about the typo. Will fix that now.\n\nI believe he does the bare minimum. Not enough to count as neglect. But he wants someone else to do it instead of him. When we were stuck at home, for example, he basically did his own thing in the office and left her to it and would often brush her off. He'd make sure she ate. But sometimes that meant doing it herself. If she was extra hungry he'd even get her to ask me to make her food. So I don't think he's doing much but something, just enough, kind of thing.", "I don\u2019t want to take his side, it just sounds like he doesn\u2019t really love her but still tries to raise her and that\u2019s way better than what her mom and her siblings are doing", "Thank you - I appreciate this comment.", "Doing his own thing in the office means working? \nOr hiding in there away from working hours?\n\nLooking after a child is a huge lot more than making sure they ate. Is he waking her up, taking care of her clothes, potty training, making/cleaning their bed, taking them to/from school, contact with schools, buying toys, and a million other things. \n\nIs he doing these things? If yes, he is a single dad struggling and doing his best, like all others. If you don't see him doing them, it is because he is. They are the thing you notice only when someone stops doing them and the messes pile up.\n\nOccasionally asking someone to hand her a sandwich...is really not that big of an ask. And frankly, if he was working, understandable too.", ">shaming him for trying to take care of his daughter\n\nLmao THAT'S rich, considering how that conversation was literally about him dumping Vivienne onto YOU \ud83d\ude44 NTA, even a little bit", "NTA but this poor child. I hope she finds the love she deserves one day and the family she needs be it friends, estranged family that didn\u2019t get to know her (not close family)or a supportive partner as she will need it.", "NTA. Your choice but I would have been her sister.  I find this little girls situation heartbreaking and OP cares nothing about it.  But it is OPs decision.  Just still awful for this little abandoned girl.", "You are not responsible for other people's bad choices. This child is nothing whatsoever to do with you  and certainly not a sister. Your Mum and her Dad were only married for 2ish years maybe? I've got older stuff in my kitchen cupboards! \n\nI'm very sorry for the poor little girl though. Does she have any grandparents etc you can speak to, who may take her on and love her? Bear in mind that your arsehole \"stepfather\" may not be telling them the full story, and playing the doting Dad to them. I know of two men who did that. Couldn't give a toss about the kids, but kept their decent (but very  long distance away) family in the dark, as they were worried about their future inheritance.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I say you \\*were\\* shaming him, but \\*rightly\\*, for REFUSING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS BIO-DAUGHTER.", "NTA.", "Jeez, I feel sorry for Vivienne.
