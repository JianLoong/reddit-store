One night, I was waiting for a front desk staff member to return from a meal break in the apartment\u2019s lobby area when I heard knocking on the glass entrance door. \n\nThe person who knocked had a bag of food in one hand and was holding up their phone to me in their other hand. It was pretty obvious to me that they were probably trying to deliver food to someone in the building and since the front desk was unattended at the time, wasn\u2019t able to enter by buzzing the front desk. But instead of opening the door for them, I signaled for them to use the callbox to contact the resident who ordered the food to buzz them in. I could see that they proceeded to buzz the front desk using the callbox but made no effort to call the resident and kept banging on the door while yelling at me to open the door. \n\nSoon after, a tenant entered with their fob and the delivery person tailed them inside and started repeatedly calling me lazy and an asshole for not letting them in to deliver the food. They left the food on the front desk while continuing to call me an asshole and lazy. I responded by saying (maybe somewhat rude) that 1) I don\u2019t work here, and 2) they should understand I was just being careful not to let people I don\u2019t know into the building. They argued that my reasoning didn\u2019t matter and that I was just too lazy to let them in and that I was being an asshole and continued to taunt me as they left. \n\nHistorically, the building has experienced several incidents of non-residents tailing inside the building resulting in several notices to residents urging us not to let any unknown person into the building so I was just trying to uphold a basic safety measure.

The person who ordered the food should have either given instructions on how they could buzz in the driver, or been down in the lobby when they received the 'your food is almost here' message all the services use. Not your circus, not your monkeys, but if the driver left the food unattended at the front desk, it could have been your peanuts.", "NTA. If you were to let any old schmuck with a bag of food into your building, it would be a matter of time until one of them wasn't a delivery guy.", "NTA\n\nI would think the same, if there's a reception desk it's for them to decide who to let in and I wouldn't want to let someone in if I wasn't sure. I get that food delivery is a sucky job and they probably wanted to get on with their night but that isn't on you.\n\nOn another note - and maybe this depends where you live - aren't delivery services meant to contact the actual apartment? If it's left at the desk anyone can grab it so they actually should have buzzed through to the resident like you suggested", "100% NTA. I commend you for taking precautions in times like these. They can call you lazy & a-hole all they want. You\u2019re not.", "I could plan a murder dress in a fast food shirt and smile and ask to be left in.   How could you be sure this was a delivery person and not someone\u2019s murderous ex? You couldn\u2019t. Your building has that rule for a reason. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are not wrong for following policy.\n\nAnd they have a lot of nerve to call you lazy when they were too lazy to call the resident to buzz them in.", "NTA. When I was in college, this is the exact ruse a man used to get into my building and beat the hell out of his ex girlfriend. It\u2019s smart to follow the safety protocols.", "NTA.  Someone with a bag that could be food could be anyone. Someone trying to get in to stalk someone, gain unauthorized access for various reasons. Delivery people should buzz the specific unit. If the person ordering doesn't put their unit, that's their fault for being a dumbass. \n\nMaybe the building management could put a sign letting delivery people know they need to buzz the unit or no access.", "NTA. I manage a fob based secure building and it very specifically states in the rules and regulations to NOT let anyone in who is not your own guest.\n\nThere is reason for the secure building.", "NTA. Just because he had a bag of food and waved a phone at you doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s legitimately supposed to be there. Did you report the incident to the night desk employee? The only lazy person is the one who ordered the food. They should get a notification that the driver is on the way and should head downstairs to meet them. That\u2019s the protocol where I work. The building should also send out a reminder about not letting people behind them when they enter and letting people know they\u2019re responsible for getting their food deliveries. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Feel free to disregard the delivery person's opinion of you. They don't know you, they don't live in that building, they don't care about your safety. They have a shitty job and they're mad about it.", "NTA. Why would you let an unknown person into your building? Also, do they not realize how unprofessional they are being?", "NTA as someone who has done food delivery for some side money i would never expect someone to let me piggyback into a building. it just isnt safe practice and is the responsibility of the one ordering to let me in.", "NTA. But why didn\u2019t you note the restaurant and, if possible, the particular delivery service, and call in a complaint for their attitude/language?", "Nta.", "NTA. You did just what you were suppose to do.", "NTA. And if I had been there being yelled at by a food service worker that I couldn't rate or review, I would've taken the food. Let them deal with a non delivery.", "NTA", "NTA", "Yta I don't know what the rest of you \u00e0re on about but your definitely ta. You clearly knew this was a delivery person. What kind of random street burglar is going to buy an outfit, buy the food, buy the phone and get a job at said delivery company to be able to show you the delivery order so next time just open the door and let them do there job and don't be ta.", "YTA. I honestly don\u2019t understand people like you. The guy is clearly buzzing the front desk, has food on one hand, has his cellphone in the other. I would\u2019ve cursed you out too tbh", "YTA - some guy making shit pay is just trying to drop off his order. The resident may have given the front desk number as the contact since often they aren't allowed to go to the door and need to leave the food at reception.\n\nThis was OBVIOUSLY not someone tailing another resident to gain entry.", "NTA, but why are you manning the front desk if you don't work there, and why man the front desk is you aren't doing the front desk duties?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All it takes is a bag of fast food and a cell phone and anyone can claim they\u2019re a DoorDasher.", "Or it could be any nutjob with a paper bag and an intent to commit violence against a resident of the apartment block.", "Where did you read that they were standing in for the front desk person?", "So how do you assume the reception staff normally identify delivery drivers? The power of assumption? Background checks? It is clearly stated in the post that this was a delivery driver every power of deduction tells you this is a delivery driver.", "To follow up, in going with this approach the driver could have completed the delivery faster making more time to pick up the next order.", "It says they were \"waiting for the front desk person to return from a meal break\". I interpreted that to mean they were standing in as a favor, as I don't know why else you would need to wait for the front desk in your own apartment building.", "Have you never lived in an apartment building with any sort of security?  Delivery people usually buzz up the exact apartment so they can be allowed in. Or they are buzzed in by whoever is at the security desk. who then confirms with the tenant that they were in fact expecting a food delivery.\n\nIt was a random guy with a bag & a phone. The OP was right not to let him in to a lobby with an unmanned desk & give him free access to a building with this type of security.", "Maybe they were picking up a package or something like that and waiting (on the resident side of the desk) for the employee to be back soon from break? There\u2019s several reasons I can think of for OP to be waiting for something from the front desk. OP never said they were standing in for the employee.", "Or maybe they were standing in front of the desk area waiting for the front desk person to return because they had a question to ask that person.  Could be anything from \"There's a leak in my apt., who do I contact?\" to \"Someone's dog crapped in the hallway, could you let the janitors know?\"", "There are many reasons why a tenant would need to speak to the front desk person. They\u2019re not just there for visitors, & most of their job is probably tenant-related."]}
