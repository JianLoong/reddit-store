One night, I was waiting for a front desk staff member to return from a meal break in the apartment\u2019s lobby area when I heard knocking on the glass entrance door. \n\nThe person who knocked had a bag of food in one hand and was holding up their phone to me in their other hand.

But instead of opening the door for them, I signaled for them to use the callbox to contact the resident who ordered the food to buzz them in. I could see that they proceeded to buzz the front desk using the callbox but made no effort to call the resident and kept banging on the door while yelling at me to open the door. \n\nSoon after, a tenant entered with their fob and the delivery person tailed them inside and started repeatedly calling me lazy and an asshole for not letting them in to deliver the food. They left the food on the front desk while continuing to call me an asshole and lazy. I responded by saying (maybe somewhat rude) that 1) I don\u2019t work here, and 2) they should understand I was just being careful not to let people I don\u2019t know into the building. They argued that my reasoning didn\u2019t matter and that I was just too lazy to let them in and that I was being an asshole and continued to taunt me as they left. \n\nHistorically, the building has experienced several incidents of non-residents tailing inside the building resulting in several notices to residents urging us not to let any unknown person into the building so I was just trying to uphold a basic safety measure.

The person who ordered the food should have either given instructions on how they could buzz in the driver, or been down in the lobby when they received the 'your food is almost here' message all the services use. Not your circus, not your monkeys, but if the driver left the food unattended at the front desk, it could have been your peanuts.", "NTA. If you were to let any old schmuck with a bag of food into your building, it would be a matter of time until one of them wasn't a delivery guy.", "NTA\n\nI would think the same, if there's a reception desk it's for them to decide who to let in and I wouldn't want to let someone in if I wasn't sure. I get that food delivery is a sucky job and they probably wanted to get on with their night but that isn't on you.\n\nOn another note - and maybe this depends where you live - aren't delivery services meant to contact the actual apartment? If it's left at the desk anyone can grab it so they actually should have buzzed through to the resident like you suggested", "100% NTA. I commend you for taking precautions in times like these. They can call you lazy & a-hole all they want. You\u2019re not.", "I could plan a murder dress in a fast food shirt and smile and ask to be left in.   How could you be sure this was a delivery person and not someone\u2019s murderous ex? You couldn\u2019t. Your building has that rule for a reason.

When I was in college, this is the exact ruse a man used to get into my building and beat the hell out of his ex girlfriend. It\u2019s smart to follow the safety protocols.", "NTA.  Someone with a bag that could be food could be anyone. Someone trying to get in to stalk someone, gain unauthorized access for various reasons. Delivery people should buzz the specific unit. If the person ordering doesn't put their unit, that's their fault for being a dumbass. \n\nMaybe the building management could put a sign letting delivery people know they need to buzz the unit or no access.", "NTA. I manage a fob based secure building and it very specifically states in the rules and regulations to NOT let anyone in who is not your own guest.\n\nThere is reason for the secure building.", "NTA. Just because he had a bag of food and waved a phone at you doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s legitimately supposed to be there. Did you report the incident to the night desk employee? The only lazy person is the one who ordered the food. They should get a notification that the driver is on the way and should head downstairs to meet them. That\u2019s the protocol where I work. The building should also send out a reminder about not letting people behind them when they enter and letting people know they\u2019re responsible for getting their food deliveries. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Feel free to disregard the delivery person's opinion of you. They don't know you, they don't live in that building, they don't care about your safety. They have a shitty job and they're mad about it.", "NTA. Why would you let an unknown person into your building? Also, do they not realize how unprofessional they are being?", "NTA as someone who has done food delivery for some side money i would never expect someone to let me piggyback into a building. it just isnt safe practice and is the responsibility of the one ordering to let me in.", "NTA. But why didn\u2019t you note the restaurant and, if possible, the particular delivery service, and call in a complaint for their attitude/language?", "Nta.", "NTA.

I interpreted that to mean they were standing in as a favor, as I don't know why else you would need to wait for the front desk in your own apartment building.", "Have you never lived in an apartment building with any sort of security?  Delivery people usually buzz up the exact apartment so they can be allowed in. Or they are buzzed in by whoever is at the security desk. who then confirms with the tenant that they were in fact expecting a food delivery.\n\nIt was a random guy with a bag & a phone.

There\u2019s several reasons I can think of for OP to be waiting for something from the front desk.

Could be anything from \"There's a leak in my apt., who do I contact?\" to \"Someone's dog crapped in the hallway, could you let the janitors know?\"", "There are many reasons why a tenant would need to speak to the front desk person. They\u2019re not just there for visitors, & in many buildings most of their job is tenant-related.", "A neighbor let another resident's mother enter our building.

Not just ANYONE can grab a bag of fast food and say they are a delivery driver! It's a rigorous screening and credential verification that consists of going to the restaurant, placing an order, and then paying.

Bigtime.", "YTA. This type of legalistic mentality makes society worse. You literally said you know why he's there. Your comment that you don't work there is crazy to me. You have to work somewhere to do a solid for a fellow human? And he came in anyway. You knew he was gonna come in. You knew he was a delivery person. You knew the door attendant was gone. You knew he tried buzzing the attendant. You had zero reason not to stand up & walk 20 feet he let him in, other than being a legalistic asshole.", "Just so you know.. we drivers are not given full names. The call boxes give the first initial of the first name, and the full last name... while we are only given the full first name and the first initial of the last making using those call boxes basically impossible. After 16k deliveries, I cannot tell you how many times the customer did not provide a gate code or door code. On top of that, these apps mask our phone number and 99% of the time the customer does not answer the phone. \n\nNot only is this a giant inconvenience for us, honestly speaking... these expensive high security apartment places are the absolute worst tippers. In our world, time is money. If we're stuck on a delivery for 25 mins, we are losing money. These apps only pay us a $2 base pay, combine that with a low or no tip order, it's $3-4 max for 30-40 mins of our time.\n\nWe cannot just leave with the order or we get deactivated, or a contract violation which leads to deactivation. \n\nI say... just do the world a favor and allow them in if you truly feel they are a food courier.
