We live in a fairly warm state, and the HOA is very strict about it. We even have little flags at the front of the yard that the grass isn\u2019t allowed to get taller then. \n\nSo the point is. The lawn needs to be mowed. I don\u2019t want to do it. My wife can\u2019t because the last time she mowed a lawn she tipped into a lake. \n\nJust so happens I know a guy who owns a goat, and I offer him $20 to bring it over to eat the grass for me. \n\nThe goat eats the grass, we keep her away from the neighbors yards, goat goes home. It was great! Way better than mowing. \n\nExcept now my wife is mad because some of the neighbors saw the goat and think it\u2019s hysterical that we had a goat doing yard work for us. She\u2019s pissed that I made us look like \u2018weird hicks\u2019 in front of all of her friends. I don\u2019t care if they think we\u2019re a little weird, I\u2019m happy to be laughed at if it means saving myself from the headache inducing sound of a lawn mower.

I didn\u2019t expect her to react so negatively to a goat, but maybe I\u2019m missing something? \n\nSo was an I an asshole?\n\nEdit: the goat does not violate HOAs (bs) policies!
