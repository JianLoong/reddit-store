The sound of the lawn mower makes me wish I could take my ears off like Mr. Potato head and lock them in a box. It hurts my shoulder (I got injured in HS and it never healed right) and I might be the only person in the world who doesn\u2019t like the smell of cut gras and gasoline. \n\nThis week was the very first week this year that I would need to cut the grass. We live in a fairly warm state, and the HOA is very strict about it. We even have little flags at the front of the yard that the grass isn\u2019t allowed to get taller then. \n\nSo the point is. The lawn needs to be mowed. I don\u2019t want to do it. My wife can\u2019t because the last time she mowed a lawn she tipped into a lake. \n\nJust so happens I know a guy who owns a goat, and I offer him $20 to bring it over to eat the grass for me. \n\nThe goat eats the grass, we keep her away from the neighbors yards, goat goes home. It was great! Way better than mowing. \n\nExcept now my wife is mad because some of the neighbors saw the goat and think it\u2019s hysterical that we had a goat doing yard work for us. She\u2019s pissed that I made us look like \u2018weird hicks\u2019 in front of all of her friends. I don\u2019t care if they think we\u2019re a little weird, I\u2019m happy to be laughed at if it means saving myself from the headache inducing sound of a lawn mower. But now she\u2019s making weird comments around the house about getting a horse to carry groceries, or a chicken to clean the windows since there\u2019s no man in the house who can. I didn\u2019t expect her to react so negatively to a goat, but maybe I\u2019m missing something? \n\nSo was an I an asshole?\n\nEdit: the goat does not violate HOAs (bs) policies! They have strict rules against raising farm animals, but if, say, the HOA presidents daughter wants a pony at her birthday party for a few hours, that\u2019s a-okay\n\nEdit: this is the lake incident! https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pwka0/aita_for_renting_a_goat/jc099o9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nEdit : goat tax https://www.reddit.com/user/Goat-rentor/comments/11qap4g/maymay_the_goat/\n\nMy friend sent it, I don\u2019t have any of her working \ud83d\ude13", "created_utc": 1678671842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pwka0/aita_for_renting_a_goat/", "score": 6175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also like thorns and thistles. I don\u2019t remember grass as a fan favorite. YTA.

I must have offended them in a past life bc those a holes come after me.", "At least golf courses and cemeteries use treated wastewater for the most part, though it would be much cooler if they combined the two (rules about playing through funerals TBD).\n\nThe worst are bottling plants and flood agriculture.", "Nah, a cow would violate their policies.", ">and the HOA has a cow.\n\nYou mean a literal cow or a figurative one?", "I forgot to account for reincarnation. You\u2019re screwed, stay away from goats \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udee1", "At that point, community chicken coop to get fresh eggs. Chickens are also useful for pest control.", "Primarily figurative, but maybe the community could start a hobby farm if a literal one turned up.", "NTA Are you sure you\u2019re happy with the person you married? Look at the way she\u2019s treating you! You need to pay attention when someone shows you their true colors, is this really the relationship you want the rest of your life? Look at her, I mean seriously look at her and think about how you\u2019ve been treated. Do you want to deal with this forever? I hope you do not have children yet.", "YTA come on!!!! Hire someone to cut your grass or cut it yourself!! Simple as that, having a goat eat your grass as a substitute for a lawnmower in a residential neighborhood is ridiculous! I\u2019d be questioning your manhood as well. And the fact you did this without mentioning it to your wife also speaks volumes! You might want to correct this quickly, you\u2019d be surprised how many small things end up being the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back! You probably have other areas where you make ludicrous decisions, just saying! YTA", "YTA. Why do you get to decide to use a goat without your wifes input? If you know your wife at all, you knew this would embarrass her. Deciding to do something like this and not even mention it to her is an AH move. Just go the smart route and get a lawn care company or pay a kid $20 to mow the lawn. Goats don't graze evenly. Check with anyone who has goats and their grazing area is very uneven. Long term the lawn will deteriorate.", "YTA", "Sorry what?! How do you tip into a lake? Was it something that you ride or something that you hold and push?", "The City of Tallahassee had sheep to deal with steep drainage ditches when I lived there.", "How do we know that driving one goat to the house and back is less environmentally damaging than just having a mower?", "Is there no woman in the house to clean the windows???", "All good points, but the HOA is going to aim at how unprofessional the final result is.  That goat isn\u2019t trimming the grass to the same height everywhere, or in neat little rows.\nIf mowing the lawn is THIS huge of a problem for OP, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have bought a house in a neighborhood with a HOA.  Also, an electric mower would solve the noise and smell concerns (the gasoline part, at least).\n\nWhile I find the goat solution amusing, I doubt the HOA will let it continue for long.", "[OP shared the story!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pwka0/aita_for_renting_a_goat/jc099o9?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\n\nTLDR, she went against her dad's advice to not go sideways along the hill, and subsequently tipped the mower and fell into the lake.", "TBH, that sounded like her taking the \"weaponized incompetence\" route to me. It's not like a lake is easy to miss, you know? Like, all of a sudden a lake appears in the path of your mower - \"abort, ABORT!!\" as you go hard right to avoid it - then crash into it accidentally.", "How is it any more extra than hiring one of the kids in your neighbourhood to do it for you?", "When is the last time you saw a mower with a catalytic converter?", "Yeah it\u2019s actually detrimental to their health to be raised alone.", "There are some major airports in the US that hire herds of goats to eat grass and invasive plants around runways (lots of steep slopes make mowing difficult). They set pens, let them eat, then move the portable pen - rinse and repeat. One herd I read about has a \"guard llama\" to protect the goats from coyotes.", "goats are actually one of the best ways to deal with kudzu", "I'm actually planning to rent a goat this summer to deal with the kudzu that has been overtaking my backyard for years. My landlady doesn't want to pay to have it removed (it has been a problem since before I moved in), and the cost of hiring professionals to do it is well outside of my budget so goats it is.", "What a great idea! We have so much of it coming from town owned land behind us, I\u2019m going to suggest this", "OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s actually making them more popular with the neighbors", "It\u2019s one of these lakes that just sneaks up on you, out of nowhere.", "Tbh getting a goat to cut your grass is maybe something you want to consult your spouse with first.", "What I wouldn't do for a little burro or pony to carry my groceries.", "Where's the confusion? The lake tipping is irrelevant to the post.", "You can if that's what the goats are trained to do. Been around them since I was a kid and climbing was never an issue when grazing on grass.", "If not for the courage of the fearless crew, they would have been lost.", "Are you kidding me? He was in heaven. That\u2019s the day he learned what boobs are.", "The burro or pony is going to write a post about parentification. Just you wait and see!", "1. Your reply above didn't make any sense.\n\n2. If you can take the sentence \"My wife can\u2019t mow lawns because the last time she did she tipped into a lake\" and accept it at face value without inquiring further, you're clearly better than all of us.", "Depending on the lawn, you might need sheep rather than goats.\n\nIf you have a large enough lawn, the goat service I remember from when I looked into it also would bring out a guard donkey.\n\nI swear, I am not making up the part about the guard donkey. (That was if they had to bring out the whole flock of goats.)", "I forget that there are thousands of acres of alfalfa here. \n\nGonna have to add that to my list.", "What doesn't make sense about my reply? It's pretty simple.\n\nAll of us? I don't see that many people hung up on it. Why wouldn't I accept it at face value? Ok, she can't mow because last time she tipped into a lake. Her options now are to accept the goat or mow.", "INFO: How evenly does the grass look after the goat is done and how long does it take?", "And quieter, too!", "One of the cities near where I live uses goats for lawn control in all their parks.", "It took a good part of the day and it\u2019s not perfectly even, but everything is under the flag and it doesn\u2019t look bad or anything \n\nSomeone else said sheep or alpacas might be better apparently", "We have goats where I live (Llandudno). They pretty much wild and feed themselves on vegetation they find on the great Orme and, of course, people\u2019s gardens. Their diet is, mostly, grass. Though they are partial to a nice rose bush.", "Okey dokey.", "Does your wife emasculate you frequently? \n\nThat is not ok. \n\nSaying \u201cthere\u2019s no man on the house\u201d. There was a problem and you solved it and now the grass is shorter. It\u2019s not like you just left it and didn\u2019t do anything about it. \n\nShe can keep tipping into lakes if she prefers.", "ofc i forgot im on reddit", "Your friend has a great green lawn mowing business he can promote. Think a lot of people would be happy to not mow the lawn and use an alternative that\u2019s more natural and sustainable."]}
