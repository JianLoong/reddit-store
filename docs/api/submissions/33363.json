However I only get 30ish minutes away from my desk in the 8 hour window I am working and I have a horrible habit of wasting it tidying up the house and not doing important things like eating. \n\nI completely understand her wanting it done at that moment because it was bothering her, as I am the same, but that is a HER problem, not a YOU problem. She refused to accept you would do the task when you were ready and able so she did it herself, fine, but her attitude about it is toxic.", "NTA \nIs she your mother or GF? If anyone demanded I do something now, I wouldn\u2019t do it at all! If you were in an office you would be doing chores on your lunch break. She wanted it done now so she did it herself and that\u2019s how it should be.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d give her a pass if you were leaving crumbs all over the floor as you ate, or if you guys were hosting a party that was due to start immediately after work. But I doubt that was the case. \n\nTell her that you need your lunch break to relax, and that\u2019s that.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you would have in fact done the vacuuming in the evening.\n\nYou need to have a talk with your GF. This is not acceptable.", "Absolutely NTA. Breaks for\u2026..well, taking a break! Unless an asteroid is going to strike the Earth and kill everyone if you don\u2019t do it you should not be expected to do chores or work on what is supposed to be your time away from exactly that.", "This is a relationship problem\n\nI hope this isnt going to be another day of guys posting about their squabble with their gf and reddit saying nta because its a relationship issue", "NTA and she sounds controlling and/or uptight. Is she usually this uptight about cleanliness? It wouldn\u2019t hurt her to waiting until the evening", "NTA. I get similar. If my GF goes out whether to work or not whilst I\u2019m working from home she gets back and asks what I have done round the house. \nDepending on what I have on that day sometimes it\u2019s nothing sometimes loads. On the days its little or nothing she gives me a hard time.", "NTA you didnt refuse to do it and you gave a reasonable time frame. She is the one who chose to do it. I dont like the tone from her like you are supposed to be at her beck and call.", "NTA. Lunch breaks are for eating. Are for walking away from the desk. Are for preparing for the second half of the day. You working from home but the lunch break still serves the same purpose. If you were at work you wouldn\u2019t come home so you wouldn\u2019t be home to do it anyway.

Did you vacuum last night?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t NEED to do chores in your lunch break, but a big perk of WFH is that you have more time to spend in your house. With no commute and no distracting coworkers, I absolutely do a few minor chores in the house throughout the day\n\nNo judgement because if there is shit on the floor i don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t take 2-5 minutes to vacuum it, but you don\u2019t have to jump up and do it right away. And it\u2019s not clear when is the last time you vaccuumed; she shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to do it if it\u2019s your chore", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're taking a break from work, not to do chores.", "NTA and actually she's the AH for making it such a big deal.\n\nIf you had already cleaned on Sunday as I saw you comment, your apartment wouldn't in theory urgently need to be vacuumed as soon as she asked. I think it's reasonable that you said you'd handle it later as you are acknowledging her ask and giving her a time at which she can it expect it to be done. \n\nIt's not a time sensitive urgent task, but for her it might be. If that's how important it is to her, then she can do it herself. I used to be like your gf because I'm a bit of a clean freak and once I see something it has to be done there and now, but that's an unreasonable ask unless I'm the one taking it on myself. I've since learned to be patient and give my partner time to acknowledge my ask and take care of it when he reasonably can.\n\nWhen it comes to chores if you have a fair division then as long as you follow through consistently, it shouldn't be an issue. Sometimes though, a person is anal about how or when something gets done and if that's the case, then the person to who it is important to should take care of it vs having their partner do it and then freak out when it's not done right or on their pace.", "NTA unless you\u2019re already a week late with the chore.", "NTA. She sounds insufferable. Is that how you like to be treated?  Is that how you like to be talked to?  Don\u2019t you deserve better than that?", "NTA People need to understand that working from home is still working. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re free to do chores & run errands.", "NTA- There are people who cannot mentally separate from WFH to being home. If you wouldn't spend your lunch break cleaning at the office, why would you do it WFH? \n\n>She said I should have been fine doing it when she asked and that I shouldn't have left my chore to her.\n\nHer feeling that she has the right to dictate how should feel is the problem here and I hope you get to the bottom of it.", "NTA. It is completely unreasonable to expect you to do household chores on your lunch break. It is also controlling to try to demand you do something right now and then act like you refused to do it at all.", "NTA.  I have spent lunch hours running errands when I have to, but it's not my choice.  Unless there was some huge reason for wanting the vacuuming done at lunch time (company coming right at the end of the work day, etc.) there was no reason that it couldn't wait until the end of the day.  \n\nMy partner sometimes puts off getting things done.  If I want them done right away, I do it myself - and then make a point of telling them it was done as a surprise for them, so they don't feel guilty.  That's how your GF should have handled it, if she wanted it done right away.", "You need a little down time on a work day.  Maybe you two could sit down a do a cleaning schedule.  That way you know how to plan your time.\n\nHer saying I want it done now is controlling and frankly obnoxious. \n\nHopefully you two can work something out.", "NTA - My lunch hour is sacred to me too, and the chores **always** can wait to the end of the day.", "NTA.  You didn't make her do anything - she chose to when you wouldn't do what she wanted you to do.  Nothing wrong with relaxing over a lunch hour.", "I worked from home for years and rarely did chores on my breaks. They got done after I got off shift. One in a great while I\u2019d put dinner in the crockpot on my lunch break but that was the extent of it.", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta she didn't want to wait, that's on her.", "NTA. There was no reason it had to be done immediately, so it would\u2019ve been fine for the small amount of dirt to sit until you vacuumed it in the evening.", "It baffles me that people are this bad at cohabiting. \n\nIf you see something needs doing, you do it. Sometimes if it's a big job you ask for help. If you think that someone is being lazy then talk to them because it's fine for them to leave it a bit if they're tired but not if they're just being lazy. \ud83e\udd37\n\nYou're NTA but you two need to work on communication", "NTA. No one gets to tell you how to handle your workday (within reason).", "Doing chores during your break is like the point of work from home. Besides no commute. Hell i do chores while working. If im on a call i just put my headset on and fold laundry. Like if you have the energy to do chores during breaks do it cause it opens up your after work time so you can actually do things that arent work.", "And it was her mess anyway; she tracked stuff in from outside and wanted OP to hup-two to clean the mess she made. I'm now wondering if she made the mess just to get in a fight lol!", ">YOU claim you split the chores evenly but how true is that?\n\nIt is true. I vacuumed Sunday Afternoon. \n\n\" i don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t take 2-5 minutes to vacuum it\" Like I said in the post I would do it after work. \n\n\" she shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to do it if it\u2019s your chore\" She doesn't have to ask me to do it", "For you. That is the point of WFH for you. Not necessarily for everyone.", "That really depends. I wfh and some days I do chores at lunch, and some days are just too stressful and I sit and relax for an hour.", "Idk i guess im just dumb getting paid to do chores while i work. And not wasting my actual free time doing chores. Like if you have kids thats one thing but if you don't. There should not be so many chores you can't get them done in 30 minutes a day. If you have an hour lunch and use 30 to eat.", "Most every hourly office worker I know doesn\u2019t get paid for their lunch break fwiw. It\u2019s not the end of the world to wait a couple hours either. Can you do it? Sure, but if it\u2019s getting done consistently who cares what time exactly it is?", "I have kids, 2 partners, a housemate, my mother lives with me and I have 9 animals.\n\n I should be using my work breaks to eat, hydrate or rest.\n\nYou do you, but that behavior is not sustainable for me and I am trying to break myself of it.", "Wow, a Reddit user unable to understand that their experience is not universal. What a novelty."]}
