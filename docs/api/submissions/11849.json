I've been a long time fandom denizen, and certain tropes (like you mentioned) have always squicked me too. That being said, there's very little evidence that a person's writing has much if any impact on who they are as a person.

You're not going to write a good scene if you're rushing through it in horror going \"don't think about it, icky icky yucky\".\n\n> Writers behind murder stories...write about it because of the suspense element\n\nErotic and horror/crime-related suspense both work quite similarly. You build the tension, especially around something quite taboo, ramp it up and then you give the reader release with a climax. People like murder stories because they receive pleasure from them.

Writing about incest in fanfic is weird but totally not uncommon, but to cope with personal trauma? There's a lot more going on in her life than just writing smut, OP should be worried, not judgemental...", "Image having to tell your partner that you suffered trauma because they violated your privacy and called your coping mechanism weird. I would lose all trust ever.", "I\u2019m no psychiatrist, but how does constantly writing deeply detailed incestuous porn help with trauma?", "Quite frankly not his problem if she doesn\u2019t want to speak about it with him", "Y'all really love.defending some gross af stuff. He's, he can judge her and dump her if he wants, that's what happens when you write INCEST PORN", "Incest isn\u2019t a kink. Wanting to have s*x with family isn\u2019t a kink or fetish it\u2019s weird", "He's the asshole for snooping for sure but what someone writes about can still be a red flag.  \n\nIf some dude spent his days writing revenge fantasy incel porn where women are tortured I'd advise any woman to stay away from him.", "\u201cNot real\u201d is not an excuse", "Incest is not a kink.", "was definitely not her fault for trusting her partner not to snoop through her things.", "Did you read the reason why she writes this stuff?", "Unpacking it in a safe space where you have total control.", "No one knows who you are, names are changed and you have power within the story your writing to give the victim justice and the bad character punishment you wish you could give without consequences. What is porn to you and OP is trauma to her and others and trying to get justice for herself in writing while making it a protective place for her as well.", "I read/write a lot of violent SA to cope with my trauma it helps me. I don\u2019t know if it works the same for others, but there\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s so much of this stuff written by women in fanfic.", "You see, there's this thing called fiction and this thing called reality. The things thay people put down in fiction don't actually manifest in reality. I know it's hard when you're young and you don't really understand this crucial dividing line, the world can feel really scary! But it's just a story, don't worry. The big bad story can't hurt you.", "By this logic the fanfic itself is also not his problem and he should stay in his lane.", "She can write whatever she likes. It's fictional and literally harms no-one. \n\nThere are published authors out there who include that kind of stuff in their work. It's fine that OP doesn't like it, but she's NTA for writing it.", "He can be weirded out sure, but dumping her for dealing with trauma through writing? Nah. Also, he violated her privacy.", "A kink is literally \"a weird sexual preference.\" If incest is sexy to her, then it's a kink.", "Yes it is. There are kinks that fall under the category of \"okay to fantasize about, not okay to do.\"", "I didn't say anything about providing therapy.  He should be supportive of his girlfriend who has experienced trauma.  And to add, if you're in a relationship with someone, serious enough to be living with them, it is absolutely your responsibility to be supportive of your partner going through hardships\n\nI agree she needs therapy, but there's nothing wrong with having a coping mechanism that isn't harmful. A lot of people write", "I've read so much fanfiction that incest at this point is just another Tuesday. That said, I really cannot get into the y/n genre (it doesn't help that for a long time I thought it meant \"yes/no\" xD).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCertain things will still squick me out, but as long as the tags are clear, I know I can back out gracefully.", "I trust my mother and father and sister. That doesn't mean that I'll let my phone open in a page that has something that I was watching and want my family to not know about, and leaving it on the living room.\n\n\nEven if you trust someone 100000% in these situations, where you want the things you write/see to remain hidden, you close the device or do something similar so others won't see the screen.", "By constantly writing detailed pornography? Isn\u2019t that sexualizing the trauma and making it a positive thing? Again I have no idea about this stuff not criticizing.", "And just because you find something appealing in fiction doesn't mean you find it appealing in real life.", "IKR! The Y/N is awful! I don't mind the stories (I enjoy the cringe/ absolute BS factor sometimes and they definitely deliver) but FFS can't you think of a better way than literally writing Y/N?!", "People are dealing with trauma in totally different and sometimes weird ways... i guess it's like some r*pe/SA victims being hypersexual afterwards, to have a sense of control after a total loss of control, when most people would think they wouldn't want to be touched for a long while. I don't really understand it either, but i've also never experienced such things, so who am i to judge how they need to cope with their trauma?", "Yes! Some of the writing is so good, and then you see \"Y/N\" pop up in dialogue, and nope, I'm done.", "Theres a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms, but how bad this might be is something much better determined by a therapist working with OPs girlfriend than any of us here. I can definitely see how this could be very unhealthy, but it really does depend on a lpt of factors we just don't have available.\n\nOP shouldnt have looked, but I can't blame him for being disturbed"]}
