In some ways he's not a picky eater - he eats a very balanced diet and is willing to try most things if he's given ample time to mentally prepare. That being said he won't eat ANYTHING without Ranch Dressing. He puts it on everything including sushi and soups. If it does not have ranch he won't touch it and has a full-blown meltdown if you try to force him. He keeps a little thermos with ranch on him anywhere he goes just in case.\n\nMy sister really wants to go and have some foods she has been missing such as Thai and Indian. I think that's great but I know these restaurants don't serve ranch. I called around to the restaurants to see if they would allow me to bring outside ranch into the restaurant due to my nephew's disability but they said they can't make any exceptions for outside food.\n\nI told my cousin as such and she insisted we could just sneak some ranch into the restaurants and it will be fine since she apparently does it all the time at home.I refused. I feel really uncomfortable with the idea and I like these restaurants and don't want to risk getting banned. I know we can just order take out and both the kids would prefer to stay at my place anyway.I told my sister if she was that insistent on going OUT to eat I could watch the kids while she went out (or stay home with just my nephew) and she could enjoy the meal herself.My cousin was horribly offended by this suggestion and has been blowing up my phone saying I'm an asshole, trying to prevent her from having a nice vacation with her kids, and that I'm ableist (despite being autistic myself).\n\nI really don't think I'm being an asshole, but I'm really bad at understanding social norms and now her husband and my aunt are texting me saying I'm horrible for suggesting she can't have dinner out with her children. She's been threatening not to come visit me and just go stay with her parents who live two hours away in the opposite direction.\n\nso AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: wow I did not expect so many people to have an opinion on this. Thank you for all the comments (even the people saying i'm an asshole). I am slowly getting through all the comments. To answer a couple of things that keep coming up.   \n1) I wanted to be accurate for the story so I called her my cousin (she is my cousin technically) But she's basically my sister and I call her as such (what we call each other) and my tired brain didn't filter that properly.   \n2) My nephew is working with a professional to help expand his food preferences and ability to eat food without ranch. There's been a small amount of success but the main way there's been any success is by planning with him what he wants to try weeks in advance (he now eats rice and white bread occassionally without it) and basically putting the food on the table and giving him AS LONG AS HE NEEDS to try it, this includes letting him leave the table to heavily stim (he likes running around in circles) before he tries it and it does not always work.   \n3) In regards to why my nephew eats everything with ranch it is a flavour thing. He's managed to express this to us. We have been experimenting to try and figure out why that flavour is ok but most other flavours aren't but there hasn't been a lot of success yet.   \n4) A lot of people who are saying I'm an asshole are saying that I'm being irrational about getting in trouble with these restaurants and maybe that's fair. Part of MY autism is that I'm extremely rule-breaking avoidant, like obviously some rules have to be broken in life-or-death situations but something like bringing ranch into a restaurant when I've been told no does not feel life or death and I'm at risk of struggling and having a meltdown myself if i sneak ranch into the restaurant after explicitly being told no. (one of the few things I still really struggle with). Not to mention some of these restaurants for me personally are safe spaces where I know I can eat most of the menu and it doesn't trigger me in any way so I feel like I'd be putting that at risk.  \n\n\nI am going to talk with my cousin with my nephew on the phone and see if we can all come up with something together, the suggestion about letting him eat before and then just get a drink at the restaurant might work, and one of the restaurants is next to a gelato place that I know he can poor ranch over without them caring.

Or if he is, it's not hard to see where he gets it from. And it's not due to his autism, either.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is stay home yourself. If she's going to insist on smuggling ranch dressing into restaurants, stay home.

You've gone above and beyond by calling these restaurants to confirm if he can be catered to. Not many people would do that.

Once they seat a party of 5 I\u2019m guessing they are pretty darn happy to have the business. Once you\u2019re there I bet you will find that the waitstaff is pretty kind to neurodivergent people, especially the kind who aren\u2019t disturbing others but simply want to mix a little ranch dressing into their food. \nNumber two, you won\u2019t get banned, I guarantee it. \nNumber three, of course your cousin wants her kids to be able to experience these great unusual restaurants! How else will they know they exist? That\u2019s one of the fun aspects of taking vacations, being exposed to new things. They will learn and experience and enjoy a couple of new restaurant environments and different cuisines which is amazing. The one kid just needs a little ranch dressing which no one will care about. Honestly, you are off the hook.\nI\u2019m thinking that your stress around this is more about you. I\u2019m not blaming you, just pointing out why you feel so stressed. I\u2019m also adhd so have certain stresses in situations I can\u2019t control. But I promise you it\u2019s going to be ok. Your cousin knows at this point how to wrangle her autistic son. Ranch dressing in a little squeeze bottle is helpful, so just let her do it. No one cares. I hope that you are able to relax a little and enjoy your time with them!

Not your sister and her son, but you. Not gonna happen.\n\nYou made a big deal over nothing. Nada. You can't tell people how to live their lives.

Sometimes I have to sit back from things and that is fine. Why don't they just hang out at home, or at least the kids, and veg out on pizza? Pizza dipped in ranch is actually super yummy, though I like garlic sauce better. A vacation at home where everyone is happy is still a great vacation!!  \nAnyway!! You do not have to be okay with his eating habits, heck his mother should really start to ween him off of this, it's going to cause some amazing health and weight issues when he hits puberty. Ranch as a frick ton of salt, sugar, and even oil in it!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't suggest that she couldn't have dinner out with her children. You suggested that you could babysit your sister's kids while she went out to eat by herself, which I think is a reasonable suggestion, given the circumstances.", "Rather than a thermos of ranch, how about several of the little packets of ranch (similar to ketchup packets)??  Easy to sneak in and shouldn't cause too much commotion!!", "NTA. You are making the right call.", "NTA. This is a safety issue - cross contamination and introduction of allergens specifically.

For reasons already been listed by many others\nBut omg can I relate to the ranch dressing situation so hard! My younger cousin is also autistic and LOVED ranch dressing as a kid. He did not have a balanced diet, still doesn\u2019t, and added ranch dressing to everything. His younger sister copied what he did, and wanted to be next to me at every meal. The smell of hot ranch dressing is revolting. I get a visceral reaction just thinking about it.", "YTA once in a restaurant they don\u2019t really care about dressings and sauces not their being used. Although it is a food item it\u2019s not like the person is bringing a meal for themselves and not paying the restaurant to sit and eat their own food. Your nephew will still be eating the restaurants food. Ive waited tables in restaurants and worked my way over time to being manager of a restaurant so I\u2019m speaking of experience. The main thing is the customer just doesn\u2019t advertise it which is what you did by calling round. Many will have had to say no when asked but ignore it if it\u2019s done quietly. You also need to remember this is their mum she has taken them plenty of places and she will know if it\u2019s been a problem before. You have no right to refuse her to eat with her own kids, shes the mother not you. I know you are not used to this but you\u2019ve majorly over reacted. If your that uncomfortable then just don\u2019t go yourself but don\u2019t make such and drama over it.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear have you never seen a mum give a bottle or breast feed a baby in a restaurant. Have you never seen a parents take out some cheeses strips from their bag to give to a kid whilst waiting on the meal being cooked. That\u2019s in both cafes and restaurants all who say no outside food. Why have you never batted an eye over that but go overboard here. As I said restaurants have to say no outside food but they use common sense and decency in situations when it\u2019s harming no one and ensuring everyone enjoys their meal. \n\nHaving autistic children myself we live with them everyday and know what they can handle and what they can\u2019t. There is enough prejudice in the world and so many people telling them they will struggle to do things others can or be productive. It\u2019s crap they are just as able but may need a different strategy to do the things but they can do them and get them done. Even bullying from kids their own age never mind adults judging them. That\u2019s hard enough but their own family doing it. It must have really hurt both cousin and her son when you basically called them out and stated as he is autistic he can not go out to eat in restaurants. That you would be embarrassed to be seen with him. You may not have stopped to think you were saying that but it was exactly the message you sent. \n\nNot sure if you know but just to say, you say it\u2019s your cousin and her kids yet you call him your nephew. You do realise he is your second cousin and only if you had siblings with kids would they be your niece and nephews. You may already know this and just have chosen to call them that but I just wanted to point out incase you didn\u2019t realise he. Sorry it just kept grabbing my attention.", "NTA, you searched all yhe ways possible.\n\n Just going all together: no, there isn't ranch there\n\nBringing ranch: not permitted.\n\nBringing the food home: she doesn't want\n\nLeaving your nephew behind: she doesn't want either. \n\nPerhaos another option could be  grabbing the food to go and eat outside like in a picnic if possible ? \n\nStill, your  sis reactions are those of an ah, understamdable due to her situation, but an ah still", " NTA. Also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being \u201cableist\u201d in this situation. He\u2019s a brat and will never amount to anything if he can\u2019t put down that ranch. I wouldn\u2019t be worried about being banned from the restaurant as much as worrying about being perceived as trash by everyone there. Time for some tough love. Throw away his ranch bottles and throw him into the deep end. \n\nHe\u2019ll never get laid later in life if he still clings to these ranch bottles.", "NTA\n\nYou put in a lot of effort to accommodate your cousin. She should say thank you instead of insulting you (ableist, really????) and threatening you. \n\nI bet she\u2019s burned out.

I'm unclear as to if this is a sister or cousin coming to stay with you since you used both at various points, but either way I don't think that part matters. Either way, she's right, if he can't eat things without ranch, it's easy enough to keep some in a bigger purse and use it for the nephew and it's unlikely to ever be a big deal. Most people actually working in the restaurants won't even actually care whatever the official policy may be, and as long as the bottle from outside isn't being waved around and made obvious, it just gets puked out to pour on and then put back in the bag, they probably wouldn't notice anyway. \n\nDon't worry so much about the plans for eating out, the kids parents have to deal with it at home and know what to do.", "NTA\n\nGet takeout. Then the child can use as much ranch as he wants: without the risk of causing a scene.", "YTA, but not too much of one. She's burned out, wants to go out. I don't see why this is such a big deal unless you're embarrassed. Just take them to restaurants you don't normally frequent. If the server says anything about the dressing, simply apologize and put it away. They probably won't kick you out if you act like you didn't know. Surely they won't permanently ban you the first time either.", "NTA if she\u2019s really missing the Thai, then get take out one night. If she\u2019s really missing going out to eat, then go out to a restaurant that offers ranch another night. Why is that so hard?", "NTA and I have a feeling her husband and aunt aren't aware of the issues she's trying to force down your throat. She can either accept that you have takeout or she can go alone. Block anyone saying unkind things to you. Restaurants have good reason for not allowing people to bring in their own condiments.", "I had a dear friend who had cancer (she has passed away) and at some point, before she ate, she\u2019d drink (or it was points throughout her day) a pinkish thin liquid. She would use a plastic water bottle and once we were eating out, and had to tell the server that while it was an outside beverage, she had cancer and had to drink it. After that, they were fine with it. No one told her to get take out. We must question ourselves why one is considered OK and autism is considered a behavioral issue?", "YTA. She knows what she is doing. You should mind your own business.", "NTA. I work with people with mental disabilities and sometimes certain places can't or won't make exceptions. That's just the way it is. I suggest finding restaurants that would allow it/ see if any others will let them bring ranch but other than that there's nothing you can do. It's an obligation to keep them safe and happy and if your relatives can't see that then they're being super ableist.", "NTA\n\nIts restaurants rules, and nobody is an AH for following rules.\n\nBabysitting as you offered is one option, another would be takeaway. At home there would be no such rules.", "NTA. Anyone saying AH has never operated a restaurant. If your nephew got sick, how would anyone know if it was the food at the restaurant or his private dressing? Which is more likely? One gets a visit from the health inspector, and the other is managed by a child and his mother. Yet the restaurant has to deal with reviews and fallout.\n\nPeople need to stop punishing restaurants. They are cooking for you. Get take out or follow the rules.", "NTA accept her \u201cthreats\u201d not to come and move on. She\u2019s clearly made many assumptions about you to the point where I\u2019m surprised she\u2019d even want to speak to you, let alone stay with you on her family vacation.", "Yes you are. My son has a feeding disorder. We bring in outside food to restaurants all the time. I have never had an issue. Just take the poor woman out to eat. If they kick you out, they are discriminating against an autistic child. You know what that makes them?", "You are not, but the restaurants are defintiv TA and ableist... sneacking in ranch is one way to deal with it, confronting them another.. Its corwardly to not go because you \"Like the restaurant\" on the other side they may be the only ones you can eat at (because you are autistic as well and like them) so i can understand you not wanting to deal with drama...and it is also ableist of your familiy to risk you to be bannend..so NAH", "She is quite burned out. Husband works abroad and has been gone for almost the last 4 months. Part of the reason for this trip was so she could get a bit of a break. I work in childcare specifically with children with disabilities so giving her time to relax was sort of my plan.   \nMy aunt however is absolutely mental (part of the reason my cousin moved away) and while my cousin is normally level-headed I worry that the stress of essentially being a single parent my aunt has been influencing her in the wrong way.", "Not really on the topic of OP, but how is the nephew bringing a small flask of ranch sauce with him, so he can add it to his plate once it is served, cross contamination? Maybe I misunderstand what you mean, please enlighten me.", ">I've worked in restaurants on and off for years and it's all about cross contamination,\n\nI don't get this, a sauce on a the plate of a random other customer is not going to give anyone a deadly allergic reaction. If it will, they really shouldn't even be in public at all.  \n  \nI work in a restaurant as well, and of course we let people bring in their own food on the rare occasion our kitchen isn't able to make anything they can eat. I don't live in the USA though.  \n  \nOnce we had a woman who specifically wanted a supermarket brand of tofu and nothing else apart from some cucumber. So she just brought a block of raw tofu and was happily chomping away at that. She's happy, I'm happy.", "Cross contamination? From what, ranch dressing on the child's plate when it gets to the dishwasher? They are not giving it to the kitchen to add to his meal from there. This is a very weak argument. Eggs, vinegar, oil, herbs, even the MSG are not uncommon ingredients to find in a restaraunt, so it's very unlikely the ranch would impact the guy washing the dishes.", "Cross contamination?  That sounds like a lame made-up excuse, they're not squirting ranch all around the kitchen, they're putting it on their own food at their own risk.  You've been gaslit by previous bosses.", "My thoughts exactly, takeout would allow everyone to have the food they want, and there would be zero issue with the ranch dressing.", "Takeout is the answer. This way, if the kids don't like the food, there's a kitchen handy to get them something else.", "They are my cousin's kids, I call them my niece and nephew since there's technically no term (or at least not one I know of) for your cousin's kids not to mention my cousin and I were so close growing up we are like siblings.   \n\n\nIn terms of the suggestion... I hadn't thought of that. It feels kinda weird having them all go by themselves but it would solve her insistence on enjoying her vacation with her kids.", "I disagree. When is the last time you went to a casual restaurant and if you had an autistic child in tow who needed a certain thing to stay happy that the waitstaff would say no, don\u2019t give that child crackers from home!

I'm glad that was ok for you, it wouldn't for me or my family.", "Totally agree with you. At first, I thought what was the big deal about brining in a couple of packets of ranch. But, after reading some of these comments, I can see the issue from a restaurant\u2019s perspective.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the cousin just doesn\u2019t care as long as her child is appeased. IMO, the OP offers suitable alternatives.", "I agree with you, but I would say, just be discreet about the ranch dressing, keep the bottle in the purse, take it out briefly to put a little dressing on the plate, and then put it away. No one will notice or care.", "I agree, which is why I would say OP YTA. Bringing a condiment is not bringing in outside food. You're not asking them to cook with it, to make their food with it. You're not going to be contaminating other customers food unless the ranch needs to be shot up 10' in to the air and rain down on nephews food. \n\nI've worked food service as well and when a group comes in and someone has a serious dietary or religious restriction, we allow them to bring in their own food so as not to exclude them from spending time with others. Mainly places don't want people bringing in McDonald's to their fancy restaurant and ordering tap water and taking up space. Maybe when you call it's policy to say one thing, but when you get down to it face to face places don't have a problem with it, it's the *hospitality* industry after all.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a bit too on the nose.", "Right, or worded it in a way that made it sound like you were bringing in ranch dressing soup and that's all your entire party was eating.", "\u201cShe\u2019s an enabler letting her son get away with this\u201d he has autism and sensor issues around food, but will eat a balanced diet and try new things as long as he has ranch dressing. \n\nMomma is doing amazing. Sounds Better than most 8 year olds. NAH OP did the right thing by calling the restaurant and asking but mom is so used to just bringing in a small container of ranch it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nRemember outside food would include a bag of cheerios for a baby or a bottle of milk. No one would think twice there.", "Who exactly is cross contaminating here if they only use it on their own food?", "Yeah my dad who has no dietary needs always used to bring chilli sauce and fresh green chillies to eat as salad at restaurants.\n\nNever had an issue.

If they aren't taught \"No\", they never have a chance to learn what acceptable behavior is, and that is never an ideal solution. The autistic person learns as a child, just as we ALL do, that there are places that do NOT ALLOW certain behavior, whether it's \"sneaking in\" ranch dressing, or sitting backwards on a chair, or splashing in your water glass.  I think the cousin needs to start trying to get the child to accept a \"sometimes no ranch\" rule, so he can learn food without it should AT LEAST BE TRIED. For example, once a week, just one bite, and then work up to once a day. Bargaining can be a good way to start this, eventually he may even skip the ranch on some foods, but she really needs to try.", "Sounds like she should go stay with her parents.

That\u2019s some Duggar level big family-ness.", "Some guy on this sub posted about having 6 kids! I couldn't believe it. Needless to say he was working 66 hours a week and that's not enough. I would like to have a big family but all I can afford is a cat.", "Yeah even NT kids still need to know that like, spaces have expectations.", "With my kids unfortunately the explanation doesn't help.", "You can absolutely sue for food poisoning. Just like you can sue for just about anything. I don't think anyone is saying otherwise. Winning is a different ballgame. Insurance would deal with this just like any slip and fall on the way to the restroom case (and actually would be on better footing with causation).", "In order to successfully sue after you develop food poisoning, you must prove:\n\nThe restaurant or facility had a duty to you\n\nThey failed to fulfill that duty\n\nYou suffered harm as a direct result of that failure\n\nYou should be compensated for that harm", "Which I agree with. Your daughter needs her meds or  she will become sick. This isn't that. I also applaud you for having the decency to call first. I also assume that if a restaurant said no, you would just go elsewhere. Unfortunately, not everyone is as reasonable as you are. OP was told no by the restaurant, but the sister wanted to push.\n\nJust to show what restaurants [deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/q4tixU8m9f).

This is unbiased as no individual matters to a restaurant that serves the public. \n\nThe point is the ingredients. Depending on your allergy, you can die from eating certain foods. Therefore, some restaurants will attempt to accommodate so that you don't perish. No one is arguing certain disorders over others. OP asked if they were the AH after refusing to sneak in outside food after the restaurant said no. I am offering multiple reasons why the restaurant said no. People can accept that or not.

Grandma has seven siblings, her kids mostly too and before that it was the same. \nMy father has 5 children which is a lot I think, but I have a patchwork family with 9 siblings and it's drenching.

I will say though when I waited tables I never worked at a restaurant that would tell a 10 yo he can\u2019t use his ranch. But we also allowed outside cakes and even wine if it was one we didn\u2019t already serve.
