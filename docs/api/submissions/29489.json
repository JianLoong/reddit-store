In some ways he's not a picky eater - he eats a very balanced diet and is willing to try most things if he's given ample time to mentally prepare. That being said he won't eat ANYTHING without Ranch Dressing. He puts it on everything including sushi and soups. If it does not have ranch he won't touch it and has a full-blown meltdown if you try to force him. He keeps a little thermos with ranch on him anywhere he goes just in case. \n\nMy sister really wants to go and have some foods she has been missing such as Thai and Indian. I think that's great but I know these restaurants don't serve ranch. I called around to the restaurants to see if they would allow me to bring outside ranch into the restaurant due to my nephew's disability but they said they can't make any exceptions for outside food. \n\nI told my cousin as such and she insisted we could just sneak some ranch into the restaurants and it will be fine since she apparently does it all the time at home.   \nI refused. I feel really uncomfortable with the idea and I like these restaurants and don't want to risk getting banned. I know we can just order take out and both the kids would prefer to stay at my place anyway.   \nI told my sister if she was that insistent on going OUT to eat I could watch the kids while she went out (or stay home with just my nephew) and she could enjoy the meal herself.   \nMy cousin was horribly offended by this suggestion and has been blowing up my phone saying I'm an asshole, trying to prevent her from having a nice vacation with her kids, and that I'm ableist (despite being autistic myself). \n\nI really don't think I'm being an asshole, but I'm really bad at understanding social norms and now her husband and my aunt are texting me saying I'm horrible for suggesting she can't have dinner out with her children. She's been threatening not to come visit me and just go stay with her parents who live two hours away in the opposite direction. \n\nso AITA?

Sounds like she is throwing a tantrum from not getting her own way, but is there also a chance this is a burned out mum projecting her frustrations due to being desperate for a bit of \"normality?\"\n\nAlso, the word ableist is getting excessively thrown around nowadays.

I think you're allowed to be uncomfortable with them bringing ranch dressing into a restaurant your frequent when you know it would not be permitted. How about she goes with the kids and you don't accompany them -- she can try bringing the ranch with her if she pleases, but you don't have to be there to face the management / staff and have them recognize you and associate you with their behavior.\n\nAlso, no biggie, but a bit confused about if these are your sister's kids (so they'd be your niece and nephew) that your cousin is bringing, but you also referred to them as being your cousin's kids, making them your cousins too.", "NTA I have an autistic child with food issues but I also work in the food service industry. There are many reasons outside food is banned but the main reasons is allergens. You can\u2019t ensure customer safety in this situation.", "NTA. I'm also autistic and had huge issues with food growing up. Restaurants in general were not an environment suitable for me until I found ones that had:\n\n1. A suitable menu\n2. Environment that didn't set off my sensory issues\n\nI simply did not go to restaurants or cafes until I was about 15 and after exposure therapy. If the specific restaurant has rules about outside food, then your party needs to be respectful of that. There's a certain level of accommodation that can be made, but not for every single issue that comes up. You've given your cousin alternatives will work better for your nephew and she's being entitled.", "Cousin or sister?", "I don\u2019t understand at all why you can\u2019t bring some ranch dressing in your bag and when his food comes, you put a little bit on his plate and then put the bottle away. Do you think the waiter walks around scrutinizing everybody\u2019s plate to make sure no one added anything from home?", "Is this a reaction post to the one where the dad visits Chinese in-laws and brings ranch with him?\n\nThe one where someone said he\u2019s probably autistic without evidence of it?\n\nIt\u2019s just too coincidental.", "Your suggestions were a great one. Forget your cousin rambling on about utter nonsense. This will give your sister a break and she can enjoy her meal without worrying about her son. And your nephew can drizzle his meal in as much ranch as he wants at home with you.\n\nScrew your cousin and just because she does bring outside food in doesn't mean you have too. NTA, but your cousin should let the adults make the decisions.", "I was totally ready to say you were TA because of the title but at each turn you just kept being more and more in the right. Restaurants can't accept outside food, they're potentially liable if something happens to their costumers. THANK YOU for not wanting to put some poor waiter through that.   \nThen you offered take out, and when said no, you offered to babysit, and your cousin could've had a nice meal for herself if she wanted it.   \nI don't think this helps now but another option could've been going to some place with a food court and the kind of food she wanted, altough it's by far less comfortable.   \nYou did everything you could and it kinda sounds like your cousin wanted to get angry at someone for any reason. NTA.", "The restaurants told you you aren't allowed to bring ranch dressing? Never heard of this. Are you sure you didn't got them wrong (maybe by the way you asked the question) and they got the impression you wouldn't order smthg but only eat your home brought food? If you order and pay for it, i see no harm for the restaurant if he adds his ranch dressing. Just put it in a nice bottle (a colored one or smthg) and if someone asks just say thats holy water and needs to be applied to everything he eats for religous reasons. \n\nI never heard of a business banning paying customer who didn't do any harm to them or another guest or was a disturbance for other guests. \n\nI had to take some pills for a while just before eating lunch a few years back and they were rather big so it was easier to swallow with a yoghurt drink. I always took my pills and my drink out to take it and then put it back in the bag. Since i ordered and payed for food and drink they never said anything - why would they? They didn't miss any sale there.", "I dunno, just having a post about a white dad who brings ranch and pesto to homemade Chinese meals, and a commentor defending the crap outta them being possibly autistic just makes it hard for me to believe this is more than just a coincidence.", "NTA you are not stopping her doing anything. She is perfectly free to go out to eat with her children. You are also perfectly free to not accompany them.", "YTA. No server is going to notice or care about some ranch dressing packets. I waited tables for years and would see people with their own seasoning bottle or whatever and didn't give a crap. You're making this a much bigger deal than it is.

You're respecting the rules of the establishments in not bringing outside food, and doing your best to accommodate her wishes to eat in a restaurant.\n\nFrankly, your cousin sounds like the AH in this situation. I think it's mean-spirited of her to assign horrible motives to you, when it's perfectly obvious what you're trying to do. \"You're just trying to stop me from having a nice vacation with my kids!\"\n\nReally?\n\nI'm not sure your nephew is the one prone to meltdowns. Or if he is, it's not hard to see where he gets it from. And it's not due to his autism, either.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is stay home yourself. If she's going to insist on smuggling ranch dressing into restaurants, stay home. This way, you won't get banned, and when she does, you won't even have to say, \"I told you so.\"\n\nAnd there is nothing ableist about respecting the rules of the restaurants.", "\"Outside condiments\" is not the same as \"outside food.\" I've worked in restaurants for 25 years. It is not uncommon to see people pulling sweeteners, salad dressings, hot sauce, etc out of their pocket or purse to use on food purchased at the restaurant. I doubt you actually called any places.", "YTA.  You're not going to be banned for life just because your cousin-once-removed (not your nephew, btw) snuck some ranch into a restaurant.  You might get kicked out, but your cousin has way more experience with this than you, and it sounds like it's never been a problem.  What they're telling you over the phone is the policy, not the actual behavior of the staff when they see you.", "NTA\n\nRestaurants won't allow outside food for a reason, cross contamination. \n\nShe is the enabler, letting her son get away with this.\n\nlet her go to her parents.", "NTA. You've gone above and beyond by calling these restaurants to confirm if he can be catered to. Not many people would do that. Your sister won't face any long term consequences if you all get caught with the extra food, it will be you who can't return to the restaurants etc. You've given her a few other options. She is unwilling to compromise.", "I don\u2019t understand why *any* restaurant would refuse such an innocuous request to accommodate the needs of an autistic child.", "Missing something?  Is this your sister or your cousin?", "NTA, ranch is nasty anyway. \n\nMaybe you could try ordering food, so the kid can have his ranch and y'all can eat Thai or Indian.", "NTA It's a food safety issue for the restaurant, and you're right that it could get you in trouble. You aren't being ableist for not wanting to break the restaurant's stated rules. You gave other reasonable suggestions like take out or babysitting. Not your fault your cousin just wants to sneak in the ranch.", "NTA. Order take-out food. Or have some nice food delivered right to your doorstep. Everybody relaxed and happy.", "NTA -  bring in outside food is usually a health code violation- and you very likely could be banned", "If those are your cousin's kids, they're your cousins, not your niece and nephew.  Cousins once removed, to be specific.", "YTA. No one\u2019s going to care if some autistic dude puts ranch dressing on his tandoori. You\u2019re projecting a weird social fear onto your cousin.", "Who calls a restaurant about Ranch dressing?  Dressing is not \u201cfood\u201d. It\u2019s the same as people who bring in a small hot sauce bottle to add to their food or spice up their soup. \nYou\u2019re not bringing in a meal for heavens sake.", "NTA\n\nI thought your compromises were totally reasonable and fair!  Your cousin is the AH here not you!", "NTA. You are doing your best to accommodate both your cousin/sister\u2019s wants and your nephew\u2019s needs within the limits these restaurants are giving you. Your sister is just being an impossible and entitled brat. She can go visit someone else if she\u2019s going to act like that.", "YTA\n\nOk number one, settle down about the ranch dressing being brought in a small container to every restaurant. No one cares. Once they seat a party of 5 I\u2019m guessing they are pretty darn happy to have the business. Once you\u2019re there I bet you will find that the waitstaff is pretty kind to neurodivergent people, especially the kind who aren\u2019t disturbing others but simply want to mix a little ranch dressing into their food. \nNumber two, you won\u2019t get banned, I guarantee it. \nNumber three, of course your cousin wants her kids to be able to experience these great unusual restaurants! How else will they know they exist? That\u2019s one of the fun aspects of taking vacations, being exposed to new things. They will learn and experience and enjoy a couple of new restaurant environments and different cuisines which is amazing. The one kid just needs a little ranch dressing which no one will care about. Honestly, you are off the hook.\nI\u2019m thinking that your stress around this is more about you. I\u2019m not blaming you, just pointing out why you feel so stressed. I\u2019m also adhd so have certain stresses in situations I can\u2019t control. But I promise you it\u2019s going to be ok. Your cousin knows at this point how to wrangle her autistic son. Ranch dressing in a little squeeze bottle is helpful, so just let her do it. No one cares. I hope that you are able to relax a little and enjoy your time with them! Please call her and say your sorry and you are looking forward to seeing them. \ud83d\udc9c", "So I read your post a couple of times to make sure I wasn't missing anything.\n\nIt seems like it breaks down to: \"I am afraid to let them sneak ranch dressing onto their food because I might get banned from the restaurant.\"\n\nThat is not logical. People sneak food all the time. Your server would have to notice and then tell the manager. Then the manager would have to decide to go off the deep end on you and ban you. Not your sister and her son, but you. Not gonna happen.\n\nYou made a big deal over nothing. Nada. You can't tell people how to live their lives. And if the biggest downfall is being asked to leave and your sister gets a life time ban, that is still no big deal. Next time, think through what is likely to happen, not what you catastrophize it to be.", "Nta but could you get a self contained packet of ranch to bring in?  Something that is shelf stable?  A local convenience store has them, they are $1 a packet, I think.\n\nI wonder if the restaurant would find that better.", "Poor siblings. Give them info on glass children!", "NTA\n\nAt the end of the day ND or not, restaurants do not cater to everybody. And while I completely  understand and fully advocate for more businesses to cater to peoples wider needs, not every restaurant can/will and this does not mean people can just ignore the rules to suit them. And your nephew is going to have to learn this lesson so they can make reasonable adjustments for themselves throughout their life because they will not be able to just do whatever they please at any given time. \n\nIf this were about cheese burgers instead of ranch I doubt she would expect to go to a Thai restaurant and just sneak in a burger, the same rules apply. \n\nI think your sister might have gone into default fight mode because of constantly having to advocate for her sons needs which is completely understandable but she will have to learn that not everything is a slight against them and throwing the word ableist around like that is not helpful to anybody.", "YTA- it\u2019s ranch, why does this have to be an issue", "nta but why don't you let her go out to eat with her children and smuggle dressing in? you don't have to be there.\n\nBy the way, I find it strangely shitty that they don't make an exception for people with disabilities.

You have no right to refuse her to eat with her own kids, shes the mother not you. I know you are not used to this but you\u2019ve majorly over reacted. If your that uncomfortable then just don\u2019t go yourself but don\u2019t make such and drama over it.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear have you never seen a mum give a bottle or breast feed a baby in a restaurant. Have you never seen a parents take out some cheeses strips from their bag to give to a kid whilst waiting on the meal being cooked. That\u2019s in both cafes and restaurants all who say no outside food. Why have you never batted an eye over that but go overboard here. As I said restaurants have to say no outside food but they use common sense and decency in situations when it\u2019s harming no one and ensuring everyone enjoys their meal. \n\nHaving autistic children myself we live with them everyday and know what they can handle and what they can\u2019t. There is enough prejudice in the world and so many people telling them they will struggle to do things others can or be productive. It\u2019s crap they are just as able but may need a different strategy to do the things but they can do them and get them done. Even bullying from kids their own age never mind adults judging them. That\u2019s hard enough but their own family doing it. It must have really hurt both cousin and her son when you basically called them out and stated as he is autistic he can not go out to eat in restaurants. That you would be embarrassed to be seen with him. You may not have stopped to think you were saying that but it was exactly the message you sent. \n\nNot sure if you know but just to say, you say it\u2019s your cousin and her kids yet you call him your nephew. You do realise he is your second cousin and only if you had siblings with kids would they be your niece and nephews. You may already know this and just have chosen to call them that but I just wanted to point out incase you didn\u2019t realise he. Sorry it just kept grabbing my attention.", "NTA, you searched all yhe ways possible.\n\n Just going all together: no, there isn't ranch there\n\nBringing ranch: not permitted.\n\nBringing the food home: she doesn't want\n\nLeaving your nephew behind: she doesn't want either. \n\nPerhaos another option could be  grabbing the food to go and eat outside like in a picnic if possible ? \n\nStill, your  sis reactions are those of an ah, understamdable due to her situation, but an ah still", " NTA. Also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being \u201cableist\u201d in this situation. He\u2019s a brat and will never amount to anything if he can\u2019t put down that ranch. I wouldn\u2019t be worried about being banned from the restaurant as much as worrying about being perceived as trash by everyone there. Time for some tough love.

I'm unclear as to if this is a sister or cousin coming to stay with you since you used both at various points, but either way I don't think that part matters. Either way, she's right, if he can't eat things without ranch, it's easy enough to keep some in a bigger purse and use it for the nephew and it's unlikely to ever be a big deal. Most people actually working in the restaurants won't even actually care whatever the official policy may be, and as long as the bottle from outside isn't being waved around and made obvious, it just gets puked out to pour on and then put back in the bag, they probably wouldn't notice anyway. \n\nDon't worry so much about the plans for eating out, the kids parents have to deal with it at home and know what to do.", "NTA\n\nGet takeout. Then the child can use as much ranch as he wants: without the risk of causing a scene.", "YTA, but not too much of one. She's burned out, wants to go out. I don't see why this is such a big deal unless you're embarrassed. Just take them to restaurants you don't normally frequent.

Surely they won't permanently ban you the first time either.", "NTA if she\u2019s really missing the Thai, then get take out one night.

Why is that so hard?", "NTA and I have a feeling her husband and aunt aren't aware of the issues she's trying to force down your throat. She can either accept that you have takeout or she can go alone. Block anyone saying unkind things to you.

She would use a plastic water bottle and once we were eating out, and had to tell the server that while it was an outside beverage, she had cancer and had to drink it. After that, they were fine with it. No one told her to get take out. We must question ourselves why one is considered OK and autism is considered a behavioral issue?", "YTA. She knows what she is doing. You should mind your own business.", "NTA. I work with people with mental disabilities and sometimes certain places can't or won't make exceptions. That's just the way it is. I suggest finding restaurants that would allow it/ see if any others will let them bring ranch but other than that there's nothing you can do. It's an obligation to keep them safe and happy and if your relatives can't see that then they're being super ableist.", "NTA\n\nIts restaurants rules, and nobody is an AH for following rules.\n\nBabysitting as you offered is one option, another would be takeaway. At home there would be no such rules.", "NTA. Anyone saying AH has never operated a restaurant.

Maybe I misunderstand what you mean, please enlighten me.", ">I've worked in restaurants on and off for years and it's all about cross contamination,\n\nI don't get this, a sauce on a the plate of a random other customer is not going to give anyone a deadly allergic reaction. If it will, they really shouldn't even be in public at all.  \n  \nI work in a restaurant as well, and of course we let people bring in their own food on the rare occasion our kitchen isn't able to make anything they can eat. I don't live in the USA though.  \n  \nOnce we had a woman who specifically wanted a supermarket brand of tofu and nothing else apart from some cucumber. So she just brought a block of raw tofu and was happily chomping away at that. She's happy, I'm happy.", "Cross contamination? From what, ranch dressing on the child's plate when it gets to the dishwasher? They are not giving it to the kitchen to add to his meal from there. This is a very weak argument. Eggs, vinegar, oil, herbs, even the MSG are not uncommon ingredients to find in a restaraunt, so it's very unlikely the ranch would impact the guy washing the dishes.", "Cross contamination?  That sounds like a lame made-up excuse, they're not squirting ranch all around the kitchen, they're putting it on their own food at their own risk.  You've been gaslit by previous bosses.", "My thoughts exactly, takeout would allow everyone to have the food they want, and there would be zero issue with the ranch dressing.", "Takeout is the answer.

When is the last time you went to a casual restaurant and if you had an autistic child in tow who needed a certain thing to stay happy that the waitstaff would say no, don\u2019t give that child crackers from home!

Honestly once they realize he\u2019s autistic they may send out a complimentary dessert because people like to make other people happy.", "I don't question your information. But could you please clarify this a little? How could the restaurant be legally responsible for what the customer choose to add to his plate?", "Best advice", "I simply reduced my life experiences to comply with social norms. Huh. I'm glad that was ok for you, it wouldn't for me or my family.", "Totally agree with you. At first, I thought what was the big deal about brining in a couple of packets of ranch. But, after reading some of these comments, I can see the issue from a restaurant\u2019s perspective.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the cousin just doesn\u2019t care as long as her child is appeased. IMO, the OP offers suitable alternatives.", "I agree with you, but I would say, just be discreet about the ranch dressing, keep the bottle in the purse, take it out briefly to put a little dressing on the plate, and then put it away. No one will notice or care.", "I agree, which is why I would say OP YTA. Bringing a condiment is not bringing in outside food. You're not asking them to cook with it, to make their food with it. You're not going to be contaminating other customers food unless the ranch needs to be shot up 10' in to the air and rain down on nephews food. \n\nI've worked food service as well and when a group comes in and someone has a serious dietary or religious restriction, we allow them to bring in their own food so as not to exclude them from spending time with others. Mainly places don't want people bringing in McDonald's to their fancy restaurant and ordering tap water and taking up space. Maybe when you call it's policy to say one thing, but when you get down to it face to face places don't have a problem with it, it's the *hospitality* industry after all.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a bit too on the nose.", "Right, or worded it in a way that made it sound like you were bringing in ranch dressing soup and that's all your entire party was eating.", "\u201cShe\u2019s an enabler letting her son get away with this\u201d he has autism and sensor issues around food, but will eat a balanced diet and try new things as long as he has ranch dressing. \n\nMomma is doing amazing.

My kid is still a toddler, but let me tell you, I would much rather eat out in a restaurant by myself than bring my kid with me.

If they aren't taught \"No\", they never have a chance to learn what acceptable behavior is, and that is never an ideal solution. The autistic person learns as a child, just as we ALL do, that there are places that do NOT ALLOW certain behavior, whether it's \"sneaking in\" ranch dressing, or sitting backwards on a chair, or splashing in your water glass.  I think the cousin needs to start trying to get the child to accept a \"sometimes no ranch\" rule, so he can learn food without it should AT LEAST BE TRIED. For example, once a week, just one bite, and then work up to once a day. Bargaining can be a good way to start this, eventually he may even skip the ranch on some foods, but she really needs to try.", "Sounds like she should go stay with her parents.  She wants someone to enable her bad choices regardless of consequences for anyone else.", "I'm disagreeing here. We took ketchup to Greece so my sister could actually eat. Mildly embarrassing, yes?

They didn\u2019t want to allow some outside items but not others. I can see both points and since they are private businesses they have a right to set the rules.

The OP said\n\n>there's technically no term (or at least not one I know of) for your cousin's kids \n\nand purosoddfeet was merely giving the\"technical\" term.", "Agree; you reminded me of some years back when I was at a local restaurant and my neighbors came in, they have two disabled boys and the youngest had a bottle of strawberry syrup for his milk.  He was hugging it and seemed so proud and...........nobody in the restaurant cared not even the wait staff who, I saw from across the room, brought him a glass of plain milk with no problem.  \n\nCross contamination in the kitchen itself I can see.  Bringing an entire meal I can see.  A condiment?   That you keep at the table and use on your own food?  Not going to be and shouldn't be an issue.", "This - I couldn\u2019t easily countenance breaking a norm or rule on purpose so as an autist I might not be able to go to a dinner where I knew this would happen.", "Yeah I was just trying to use OPs situation as a possible explanation why restaurants might not allow outside food at their place. Like they have no way of knowing if the stuff someone brings in and puts on their food is safe to eat, but they might be blamed for the consequences nonetheless. \n\nIt's probably unlikely that someone carries a container of ranch dressing for several days before using it. But all day in the warmth is not that incredible. Imagine Mom putting sons daily emergency ration in a container in the morning, then going out to do holiday stuff all day and going directly to the restaurant for dinner. I'm not that familiar with ranch dressing since you don't usually get it in Germany but I can imagine that consuming it after a whole day in mom's handbag is not advisable.", "Also, before going on a power trip or giving into a child's every whim, it's often helpful to see if they're willing to just cooperate. They often are!", "Yeah, it's subjective. Because you don't need a written policy to tell you that it's probably ok to bring ranch but not okay to bring a full meal. Or you can bring special food for a baby but not their own eggs and pancakes.", "156?!?! How many aunts & uncles on both sides does he have? Or has the whole family been cursed with multiples - triplets, quads etc?!?", "Yeah I do think a restaurant should be more accommodating of a condiment tbh.", "It\u2019s in an insulated flask, so it wouldn\u2019t suffer from the horrors of a mother\u2019s handbag, but I take your point that the restaurant couldn\u2019t know this, especially in these hair-triggeringly litigious times."]}
