That's when OP decided to say \"well.

Because children can disrupt a wedding. That decision is not done out of spite, it is done out of a sense of decorum, they want an uninterrupted experience. Additionally, where do you draw the line? 1 kid only? 2 kids only? Does it stop at 8? Weddings are charged at a per place seating cost and the kids could shoot the cost up and many of them will not even eat the food.\n\nYou are being petty, but that is fine, you're just showing your true colors.\n\n But I would go a step further.

It's YOUR wedding. Not theirs. Fuck them if they are letting a couple of kids ruin their day. It's not their special day to begin with, it's yours. So they need to shut up about this and accept that.\n\nI really hate it when child free people make it their entire personality and how they are letting kids ruin their lives when all they should be doing is to just live and let live. They were once kids too. Kids will always be in the world and around us. They don't get to ignore that or be mean or drag everyone else into their shit too. That's a horrible mentality to have.", "YTA if you are going to let certain child free people (who want a child free wedding) be the reason that other childfree people are uninvited.

Is this a general attitude or a 3 strike situation? This feels more like a soapbox post after someone wanted a childfree wedding. \n\nEspecially to add an additional layer of guest vetting. Not everyone without children would be uninvited. You would have to go through every childless invite to determine how much they dislike children. How? Some you would barely know. They could be secret kid haters! Seriously, this is pretty ludicrous. Your sentiment is understandable, but the situation feels fake.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding.

However, uninviting all childfree people does seem like an overreaction, too.Not all childfree people are the same.

If children make you happy, then celebrate that.\n\nShould people who have been invited ask you to not have kids at your wedding? No. Not their party. They can choose to attend (or not) or to leave early if the kids bother them. But they don't get to plan someone else's wedding. Being a guest at a wedding is about celebrating the newlyweds, not about any one guest's preferred party style. \n\nDoes the entitled behavior of a few (or many) childfree people make it ok to excluded everyone who isn't a parent? No.  I'm sure that you have people on your list who are not parents for reasons other than a voluntary choice. Single. Infertile. Whatever. Excluding them sounds hurtful and mean.  \n\nUninvite people who are being entitled PITAs? Seems a little extreme to me, but sure, I suppose.  Letting that spill over to anyone who didn't complain - that would be an a** hole move.", "YTA or ESH XD\n\nbut also hilarious. The adult thing would've been to just respond that you love having children around and you love the idea of having them around for your wedding. Personally I think it is unnecessary to disinvite people you clearly wanted there (because otherwise you shouldn't have invited them in the first place), but you could make it clear that you are inviting children and that if they dislike that so much you understand that they won't make it, and perhaps they can help organise a nice dinner later with just adults, but that isn't the vibe you want for your wedding.\n\nUninviting them because they dared to question your decision is childish (and little bit AH move), luckily children are allowed at your wedding and I'm sure it's going to be great!", "NTA\n\nI understand why people would like a childfree wedding, while I don't hate kids in general I just can't imagine the couple reading there vows while a kid cry and scream his head off in the background, or enjoying the party and a kid ruining the cake with his hands or even pushing it of the table, while a few others run around between the guests, then accidentally falling and then scream for the next ten minutes, so ya, I believe there are events that simply aren't ment for kids, especially under 14, but that decision is up to the couple to make since it's there day, if you can't take it being around kids in events then you should just not go, trying to guilt trip you into excluding people you want to be there is just not the right thing to do.", "ESH.

It's your choice to invite whomever you wish to your wedding. In fact, maybe you should invite only people under 21.", "NTA. I disagree with you completely, but it is your wedding lol. Fascinating logic though", "I personally have been to too many weddings where kids have overrun the dance floor, being hyper and chaotic and rolling all around and spinning and falling down, and wrecking into others to the point where most adults just gave up trying to have a good time dancing because they\u2019re worried about stepping on a 7 year old lying on the floor or being whacked in the face by a 10 year old acting wildly and flailing their arms all about because they\u2019re not being spatially aware of others. I\u2019ve seen kids touch and or pick up so many cookies at the cookie tables, not just the ones they picked up to eat. I\u2019ve seen kids scribble all over keepsake picture frame mats or other guestbook type things with the sharpies, writing and drawing all over what others wrote, essentially ruining it. I\u2019ve seen kids being jerks to the venue staff. \nI don\u2019t blame the kids at all, truly.  I place 100% of the blame on the parents for first of all, not raising their kids to have any sense of decorum at all, even for their young ages, even four year olds can know that it\u2019s not okay to touch cookies you\u2019re not taking or to not knock things over, etc. Secondly, I blame the parents because you can\u2019t just take your kids to a wedding and check out completely and not be responsible for their behavior and most importantly, to ensure that their behavior does not infringe on anyone else\u2019s enjoyment of the event in any way. Too many parents just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the same with restaurants and airplanes! Not all, but a lot. \nThere are ways to work with this. Getting a couple sitters on-site to keep them occupied in an area with activities, crafts, etc seems like a good idea, or having parents arrange to have their kids picked up if possible, by someone (a sitter or other family member not there) at a certain time. \nWhen our boys were young kids, even if a wedding invitation included them, we almost always chose to get a sitter and leave them home because although we loved spending time with them, we wanted to be able to connect with other adults, have some drinks, dance, etc, without being mindful of what they\u2019re doing and where they are, basically to have a night off. Too many parents go to weddings with their kids and have a \u201cnight off\u201d and someone else, by default, has to pick up the slack to mind the kids or \nto put up with their bad manners, which is often the venue staff which is horrible and unfair, it\u2019s not their jobs. I understand that if it\u2019s a wedding out of town, maybe there\u2019s no options for childcare, in which case, you either have to leave them home, or one or both of you not attend and send a great gift ($) anyway, or take them and realize unfortunately, that you can\u2019t really fully partake in the festivities. It sucks but it\u2019s kind of what you signed up for when you decided to bring children into the world in the first place. \nI did have a wedding reception that said \u201cadults only\u201d on the invitation. Honestly, several people thanked us for that! Are they child haters? No! I love kids myself, obviously, but some people feel that a fancy event like that (formal ballroom evening reception) isn\u2019t always the best environment for kids. Two couples with kids got in touch to ask if the \u201cadults only\u201d really meant no kids, like if we were serious. Um, yeah, that\u2019s what it means. We very politely explained that yes, that\u2019s what it meant and said something like \u201coh, his nephews and some of his friends\u2019 kids are soooo wild and \u201cruined\u201d another wedding recently, so we are so sorry but to be fair we are just having no kids, we apologize but didn\u2019t see any other way around it, we know your kids would never be like that\u2026\u201d even though that wasn\u2019t true, we thought it was a good way to go as not to offend them. We offered to give them a couple names and numbers of trusted babysitters we knew very well and even offered to cover the babysitting costs in advance, but they didn\u2019t take us up on that and I think left kids with grandparents, and you know what - it was those couples who I remember seemed to be having the best time at the reception! Dancing, happy - probably because they had a \u201cnight off!\u201d\nLike most things in life, a few idiotic jerks ruin things for everyone else who does do things right.", "Kinda?\n\nI can see both sides of the debate on whether weddings are better with or without young children.
