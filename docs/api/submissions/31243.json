Our kids are very small and both wake up between 5am and 6am. \n\nMy husband is one of those magical people who can totally function on 5-6 hours of sleep just fine. I'm not. I need a full 7-8 or it literally ruins my day the following day.\n\nWe both work full time from home, and we're both full-contact parents. He's an amazing involved dad who truly does share the load at least 50%, and a really good husband. The only problem is bedtime. \n\nGiven that our waking hours are largely filled with work and kids, he wants to stay up LATE every night playing video games since it's really his only chance to do so. It's become a much worse problem since Starfield came out. Left to his own devices, he'd go to bed at 1 or 2am. The kids will wake up by 6am no matter what, so we can't shift what time we get up in the morning. Here's the kicker - I can't fall asleep well alone. \n\nHe wants me to go to bed alone when I'm tired around 10 while he stays up and enjoys his free time.\n\nThe problem is I CAN'T SLEEP. If he doesn't come to bed, I toss and turn for hours waiting for him. If I do miraculously fall asleep, he wakes me on the way in to bed using the bathroom, brushing his teeth, climbing into bed, etc. \n\nI'm routinely not getting anywhere near the amount of sleep I need. I start crying in the middle of the day because I'm so exhausted. My entire body hurts from how tired I am. I have begged, pleaded, come up with compromises, and nothing works - he just won't come to bed earlier. He'll say he's coming but then gets absorbed in his game and another hour will go by. I can't take a sleeping pill or anything because I'm breastfeeding on demand and need to be able to wake to the baby's cries at night. \n\nI'm so resentful that my physical needs aren't being met, but I understand his perspective that it's unfair that he should have to go to bed because I'm tired.

Just lay there awake while you sleep? Because as a night owl, he won\u2019t actually be sleeping. \n\nI\u2019d suggest a body pillow and/or a weighted blanket. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an AH for being upset since you\u2019re likely not thinking clearly due to lack of sleep. You\u2019re a bit of an AH for expecting his circadian rhythms to change to fit yours. As a night owl myself, I can promise it doesn\u2019t work that way. We already have to go against our natural instinct to be up late in order to function within societal norms. You\u2019re asking him to make even more concessions, which likely just isn\u2019t possible.", "YTA. And it\u2019s made worse by you falsely claiming that this situation is \u201cyour physical needs not being met\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want my husband to sacrifice his only free time because I  \u2018require\u2019 co-sleeping like a small child.\u201d That\u2019s your post summed up in one sentence.", "YTA. You can't dictate an adult's bedtime simply because you're codependent and cannot sleep without him. \n\n\n\"Honey, I absolutely can't sleep without you so your bedtime is whenever I'm sleeping or I'll toss and turn all night\". What a wild ask.\n\nThe only time an adult should be talked to about their bedtime is if their partner shares expenses with them and the night owl is about to get fired for constantly being late. Or they're constantly missing morning obligations concerning shared children. \n\n\"I'm routinely not getting anywhere near the amount of sleep I need. I start crying in the middle of the day because I'm so exhausted. My entire body hurts from how tired I am.\"\n\nThat has nothing to do with him and at this point, he's probably staying up later to avoid you and the increasing breakdown of your mind. I would be disturbed if a partner said all of this was happening because they can't sleep without me.", "YTA - I get it, but yeah, you can't expect him to go to bed when you do. If he wasn't able to get up in the morning and was pissed off/moody etc I'd give a different answer, but he's not.   \n\n\nYou need to learn how to sleep alone for your own health and the happiness of your kids (I know myself moody, tired mum is no fun).   \n\n\nAlso, I'd suggest maybe getting some sleep sounds to put on which will distract from the noise of your husband coming to bed. I listen to thunderstorm sounds all night as I wake up so easily and find it hard to get back to sleep.   \nOr maybe suggest that your husband sleeps in another room/downstairs on the nights he stays up late, not as punishment but so that he's not waking you up and interrupting your sleep.", "Info: have you tried a weighted blanket? Sounds weird but it might help", "YTA, even children are supposed to learn how to fall asleep by themselves. You can\u2019t dictate another adult\u2019s bedtime. Let him have his time to enjoy his hobbies and free time. There\u2019s nothing fun about just laying there waiting for someone to sleep", "I think this is a you problem. So is he supposed to lay in bed awake for hours so that you can sleep? You should talk to a doctor/therapist. YTA", "\u201cHere\u2019s the kicker\u201d it\u2019s not a kicker. It\u2019s a you issue. Being so co dependent where you absolutely CAN NOT fall asleep without them physically being in bed with you sounds.. dysfunctional.", "You're getting a hard time from most people, but I understand what you're saying. Sleep deprivation is absolute torture, there's something he can do to help but he won't, which sucks. But again of course, it's not actually his fault.\nIt's a shame you can't try medication at the moment. I suffered with insomnia for 20 years, tried everything, nothing worked. I went on amitriptyline for anxiety and oh my god, best thing I ever did. Going to bed and just being able to sleep is absolutely amazing honestly.", "YTA. \n\nEven tho I kinda get your point cause my gf and I are the same (I'm the night owl and she's an early bird with a quite light sleep), you can't simply make your sleep his responsibility.\n\nI mean, we maybe need some more info like: how big is your house? Do you have another bathroom a bit further from the bedroom? Could he sleep in another room so he doesn't disrupt your sleep? Stuff like that.\n\nBut, based on the things you wrote in the post, he is a good husband and dad, completely involved with the kids and doesn't miss out on anything regarding his parental and relationship duties so the only thing that's lacking in your perspective here is that he doesn't comply with your routine and that's killing you.\n\nI think you should see a doctor regarding your difficulty in sleeping. I'm no dad and I don't know much about women's biological changes after pregnancy but if you didn't have this problem before kids then that's something to consider.", "YTA. Why should he come to bed to lay awake watching you sleep? It's weird! Do you have a downstairs bathroom? Ask him to use that to get ready for bed and buy some earplugs.", "I feel this deeply, this has been the last 20 years of my life.  You won't be able to change his late night gaming habit. Even when my husband doesn't game, he stays up much later watching shows.\n\nEventually we got separate rooms, largely because he snores terribly and I'm a light sleeper.\n\nThere are good suggestions here: Body pillow, heated mattress pad to warm the bed, sleep sounds (I use the Calm app). \n\nA very light YTA.  Very light, because I totally understand your perspective, but it's not a realistic expectation.", "I was in a similar situation with me being the night owl. I\u2019d go to bed with my partner, we\u2019d cuddle, talk and/or have sex, after he fell asleep I\u2019d get up and do my thing. Bedtime was one of our favorite times we spent together and the whole thing took like an hour. It\u2019s hard to spend alone time together when you have kids, and bedtime played a huge rule in keeping us bonded and emotionally close.", "So where other families have problems with kids not wanting to sleep alone, here we have a situation where you as an adult think your husband should stay with you until you sleep?", "Hubby and I have trouble going to sleep alone also. I will go in and lay with him for 20 minutes, then get up and do my thing, or the other way around.  It works for us.", "I had this exact problem when my husband and I first got married! For me it was the waiting that kept me awake whether I liked it or not. We sleep in separate bedrooms now and it's amazing! He can go to bed later and I'm not lying there waiting for him to come in. Worth thinking about maybe?", "Don't give a fuck what everyone else is saying NTA. You're grateful for your husband and everything he does. You aren't disputing that. But being mentally and physically exhausted and doing night feeds bc breastfeeding is rough. So you need his presence to comfort you right now... It shouldn't be a big deal. Handheld games dude.", "YTA. That\u2019s a you problem. Everyone deserves alone time and he already does his parenting and husband duties. It\u2019s not his job to put you to sleep or whatever. You need to grow up. To frame this as your physical needs not being met because you can\u2019t go to sleep alone is manipulative and completely unfair.", "This is a hard situation. I use to have a similar problem with my now ex - but he refused to self regulate and couldn\u2019t run on limited sleep. I understand where you\u2019re coming from - wanting that time with him because you have two small children and don\u2019t get much alone time. I would discuss it with him and explain that you miss him. But also look into a bedtime routine and a pregnancy pillow (they should NOT be marketed like they are. They are the best invention in the WORLD.) as well as a nighttime routine to help you relax from the day. \n\nI see both sides as a person who struggles with sleep, and I\u2019m currently expecting so I get the mom side as well - but his mental health would be effected by not getting HIS time to himself too. Look into ways to self soothe at night - taking baths or a shot shower, weighted blankets, pregnancy pillows - but also try to discuss with him that you miss that alone time. Because this doesn\u2019t read like \u201coh my god he has to come to bed with me\u201d it reads as \u201cI miss my husband\u201d to me.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA - imagine being an adult with kids and acting like a toddler. Your husband doesn\u2019t need to tuck you in at night. You sound quite controlling and entitled.", "YTA and I say this as someone who is similar - if my partner isn\u2019t already in bed when I go to bed, I will struggle to fall asleep until he is. But I don\u2019t make that his problem - it\u2019s mine. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate when he goes to bed just because you can\u2019t sleep alone. What you\u2019re experiencing is a you issue, and it\u2019s on you to take steps to address it - and the step can\u2019t be \u2018he just has to come to bed with me\u2019. You need to be trying things to improve your ability to sleep. Go to your GP and ask for a referral to a sleep clinic - if you physically cannot sleep without him being there, you have a sleep disorder. What if he goes away without you?", "YTA - it\u2019s not fair for you to demand he come to bed with you. You want him to give up his only time to decompress to sot wide awake in bed. This is a you problem. Download a sleep app, figure yourself out.", "NAH\n\nI have a similar problem, I can't fall asleep if I know my husband is coming to bed later. The suspense keeps me awake, because I will get woken up by him coming to bed. I also suffer from insomnia and sleep anxiety. It's not like these things are easy to cure. Actual sleeping pills are addictive and can make you drowsy during awake hours as well.\n\nYou should realize it's a you problem, but asking for some understanding and kindness from your partner does not make you an asshole. Nor is he an asshole for wanting to stay up and get his free time, if he doesn't need the sleep. \n\nMy solution is going to a separate bed if my husband wants to stay up, or if I can't sleep. If I know he isn't coming, I can sleep just fine. Maybe that could work for you as well? If you have a spare bedroom, tell your husband you can either sleep separately, so you can stop being dependent on him for your sleep, or go to bed at the same time.", "NAH\nLong time lurker needing to comment on this.\n\nI have always found it easier to fall asleep with someone I care about, I have always had difficulty sleeping.\nFortunately my girlfriend is the same so it works nicely for us and we manage fine when we're apart because we know that we will have that when we are together.\n\nYou are not the asshole, it is a you problem, however being in a relationship with someone means you help each other with your problems where you can. Theoretically he could have the same problem but it wouldn't be identified because you're always already there when he goes to bed.\n\nI personally find it hard to believe that your husband would not benefit from additional sleep if can't stop himself from falling asleep when coming to bed with you. It could quite possibly be that he is sacrificing sleep to game, which is entirely his choice but may not be healthy in the long term if he is doing it every night.\n\nI personally feel like some compromise could be found which gives you both what you want and benefits health/wellbeing. You may find that if some nights your husband comes to bed with you and falls asleep with you he may be in general more well rested and therefore able to come to bed with you for 10mins or so while you fall asleep without himself falling asleep so he can get up and game.\n\nI wish you both the best and hope you find a solution that is equally workable!", "I feel for you! While at the same I agree with others, that you can\u2019t expect your husband to solve your sleep issues.\n\nAlso wanted to share - you CAN take meds to help, without them affecting your breastfeeding!!! I learned this way too late (I developed psychophysiological insomnia pre-pregnancy, and dealt with it for years) that I so badly wish I had brought up with my doctor sooner. She told me that there are meds that don\u2019t get absorbed into your breast milk, that are totally safe. I\u2019ve been taking half a dose of trazodone for a while now and it has literally saved me.\n\nDefinitely call your doctor and at least ask about options! You don\u2019t have to suffer, or cause a riff in your marriage.", "Info\n\nWhy don\u2019t you fall asleep with him on the couch? \n\nMy wife does this when she just wants some extra time with me. I hang out and she sleeps next to me.", "I would highly recommend a white noise machine.  I got a little one for the nightstand and it works wonders.  I used to struggle to fall asleep and would also wake up very early averaging less than 4 hours a night, so falling asleep quickly with the machine was awesome!  Alas it does not keep me asleep but that is another story.", "Sleep in separate beds.  It blows my mind that people want to sleep in the same bed as their partners all the time.  Get another bed and be free!", "Get a cat.  It will warm your bed, purr when petted and you will feel less lonely.", "Honestly going against popular opinion but I say NAH - yes I think it's excessive that she can't go to sleep alone, but if you are a light sleeper prone to insomnia like myself, partner coming to bed later than you always wakes me up and prevents me from sleeping. It's really unsustainable and creates extreme resentment. If you can and have space, separate bedrooms is the only answer. Good luck!", "Starfield. I can relate. But you have to retrain yourself to be able to sleep without him. Sometimes people just don\u2019t have the same sleep needs and schedule.", "How old is your baby? Have you been screened recently for PPD/PPA?", "NAH.\n\nI think it is a very common problem you face. I think you should let go of any expectations towards your husband when it comes to bed time. Times will change again! Just find a solution that suits all of you for the time being, and be it a separate bed for you.", "The most gentle YTA.\n\nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014but his gaming time at the end of the night is every bit as important to his mental/emotional health. You can\u2019t say, \u201cyou know that one part of your day that\u2019s just for you, that makes you feel less like a husband/dad/work machine and more like a human again? Please skip that, I need you as a weight in the bed next to me so that I can sleep more.\u201d\n\nYou slept without him before you met. It\u2019s time to figure out what kind of combo helps you do it again.", "NAH\n\nI had to go back and read this to make sure it wasn't my wife... Starfield is eating up my time as well in this very same manner, but I only have one kid... so totally safe.\n\nIt is reasonable that you would want for intimacy reasons (not just sex) for him to go to bed with you some of the time. If he is just a crutch though for you getting to sleep, that is not a healthy thing. I would look into some sleep aids and/or speak with your doctor about what you can do to help you fall asleep as insomnia is an issue (you really shouldn't have issues falling asleep if you are also so tired you are breaking down).\n\n(my wife actually gets mad if I go to bed before or at the same time as her as she wants time to tik tok and doesn't like me there for it)", "Selfishly you want him to go to bed with you because it helps YOU fall asleep. He is a good husband, good father, and shares 50% of the work load. It seems that his only time alone is late at night where he can de stress and relax and have some alone time. I would allow him that time as he is succeeding everywhere else with you and your family. Maybe even buy him something for his space, new controller, or game or snacks and let him know you appreciate and love him", "Unfortunately, YTA. It's unreasonable to expect him to go to bed 3 hours early (and miss out on important wind-down time), because you believe you can't sleep without him there. I assume you want him to just lie there for several hours, bored and miserable, whilst you fall asleep? How is that fair? \n\nI absolutely believe you don't have a solution currently, to falling asleep without him there. But it's a mistake to think its impossible to do. As others have said, even children learn to fall asleep, without somebody there. It's too needy as an adult, to expect another adult to be responsible for your sleep in this way.\n\nThere will be a solution, you just need to keep looking for it. And if you believe there's no way you can sleep, you absolutely won't. It will involve trial and error, but there will be a way. Maybe some sort of targeted therapy? You need to learn to challenge whatever thoughts are keeping you awake. \n\nThe only thing you have a point about, is him waking you up when he uses the bathroom, etc. I think you're fine to insist he brush his teeth, etc. BEFORE you go to bed.", "YTA\n\nI was thinking you were going to go the route of \u201cintimacy\u201d but it\u2019s just cause you need his body beside you. It\u2019s cute, but also not fair and a bit of dependency. \n\nBody pillow, change in night time routine (aroma therapy, a walk, book etc.). For me, I also get insomnia, many sleep aids don\u2019t work. I had to figure out what was keeping me up, 80% of the time it was my mind and constant thinking. See if you can figure out yours, if it\u2019s an expectation that he comes to bed, that\u2019s for you to manage", "I can't believe some of these y.t.a. votes. Have these people not been in a relationship before? You're supposed to compromise in a relationship, on both ends. OP, your husband can spend 1 or 2 nights a week going to bed with you, and watch a show or movie with you there (like you said you used to do in your comments). I think it's really unfair you are expected to give up your sleep yet you get called an ah for asking him to give up some alone time.\n\nYou being exhausted to the point your mental health is suffering under it is awful, and there needs to come a solution fast. I do agree with some other users that you need to find other ways to fall asleep (there are some really good recomendations in the comments), but it will benefit both of you and your relationship if your husband can comprimise a night or 2 a week to lay in bed with you watching something for about an hour.\n\nBtw, I think it's really ironic some users here mention him needing his alone time for his mental health, while you are having emotional breakdowns during the day, which is a clear sign of (starting) mental health decline. I fear if that continues it will start affecting your parenting, and not in a good way. So NAH as long as you both work on this problem.", "I can relate to this because I too have trouble falling asleep if my husband isn't settled in the bed. It probably is unfair to ask him to give up his free time just to accommodate you. This arrangement works fine for him, but unfortunately it is not working for you. Maybe you could take a sleep aide, or maybe he could agree to come to bed the same time as you a few nights a week (staying up every night may even catch up to him anyway).", "Compromised. You go to bed 1 hr later and he one hr earlier .", "This may sound like a strange idea, and I don't know if it's been suggested already, but it might be his scent you're missing. His natural scent. Maybe in addition to the body pillow and weighted blanket others have suggested, a t-shirt with his natural scent would help you fall asleep. It worked for me when my husband and I first moved in together. He's a truck driver, so he's gone every 4 - 6 weeks. Just ask him to wear the same shirt for a few days in a row after a shower, but no cologne or other artificial scents. Maybe while he's gaming. It could help trigger your brain to relax and help calm your mind so you can sleep.", "Check with your doctor but im pretty sure you can take doxylamine succinate (Restavit) to help you sleep when you're breastfeeding. You need to make your sleep needs your problem to solve. Not his.", "I have a similar situation at my home. I sleep ~6 hours a night, my wife needs 8-10 hours. I want to stay up and play video games, she has trouble falling asleep without me.\n\nYou know what we do?\n\nWhen she is ready to go to bed, I spend ~15-30 minutes cuddling and tucking her in. When she falls asleep, I leave the bed and go play videogames. When she's struggling to fall asleep, I stay longer, but eventually she lets me go anyway even if she's still awake because she doesn't want to force me to be bored for hours whenever she has insomnia.\n\nESH, y'all need to find a working compromise. It isn't reasonable for you to expect him to lie in bed bored for hours so you can sleep, and it isn't reasonable for him to just demand you sleep without him.", "NAH - but you will be if you ignore this advice :)\n\nMy wife and I used to have this same fight. It would get pretty heated once in a while where she would flat out demand I come to bed. She could never give a rational reason for it other than she didn't like it and her bad feelings from me not obeying her whims kept her up. She would ruminate about it.\n\nTurns out these were symptoms of her untreated Generalized Anxiety Disorder. After some work getting her meds worked out and a regular therapy routine she is a much happier woman and we are a much healthier couple. Please don't take this the wrong way. There is so much stigma around mental health - I also needed therapy to work out my own shit. \n\nBut what you are describing is absolutely not 'normal' and you do need to speak to a professional. I encourage you to look for someone who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and/or Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you're doing all the night parenting, allowing your husband to play video games to his heart's desire.\n\nSleep deprivation is serious and can easily lead to postpartum depression.  If she's doing all the night parenting with no break ever, she will NEVER catch up on sleep.  It will start compounding and lead to a mood disorder.  Sleep deprivation is a special type of hell.\n\nBefore you fools come at me, I agree it's unreasonable to ask him to change his sleep schedule drastically.  But he made this baby too, and he needs to meet her halfway to help solve this problem.  THIS IS A SHARED MARITAL PROBLEM DUE TO THE DEMANDS OF A BABY AND REQUIRES EFFORT FROM BOTH PARTIES.  Maybe she can pump and he's responsible for the first bottle since he's up anyway.\n\nIf you think differently you probably don't have kids or never suffered serious, long-term sleep deprivation.\n\nHer husband needs to step up.", "Yup, YTA. It's ridiculous to expect your husband to go to bed whenever you go to bed. \n\nFind another way to fall asleep. You're not being fair or reasonable.", "YTA, you need to learn how to sleep without him. I\u2019ve been with my husband well over a decade, I\u2019m an early bird and he\u2019s a night owl. He stays up late editing videos or playing games or whatever and I\u2019m able to sleep without him no problem. Maybe have a T-shirt that smells like him and put it on your pillow? I did something similar with my kids when they were small.", "YTA. What did you do all those years when you went to bed before being with your husband? I love sleeping in the same bed as my husband too, but I definitely have no problem going to bed or sleeping in it without him.", "YTA. Definitely YTA.  Your sleeping problem is your problem.  Not your husbands.", "YTA. Of course you can\u2019t make him come to bed when you do how ridiculous you need to sort out a solution for yourself, what would you do if you were ever single again just never sleep?!", "YTA.  How the heck did you sleep as a kid and teen? Have to have someone in bed with you back then too? \n\nIf he's doing his fair share of the work he also is entitled to his free time as well as a sleep schedule that works for him.", "I think this is barely tips into YTA from a no assholes here. Insomnia, whatever the cause, is a nightmare. But I think you need to try and find a solution that doesn\u2019t require your husband to forgo his own needs - you mention compromises, but your phrasing makes it sound like they still involve him coming to bed when you want him to, so are they really compromises? Can you nap during the day? Can you pump so you don\u2019t have to get up multiple times a night? What is it about having him in bed that you need in order to sleep and can you replace that with a weighted blanket or a body pillow? Have you talked to your doctor about ppd? I wish you the best in finding a solution, and I hope your husband supports you in that, but ultimately it\u2019s not his responsibility to be the solution for you.", "Soft YTA.\nMy husband expected me to come to bed when he went to bed, even if I wasn't tired yet or wanted to watch a movie. It made me feel resentful for a long time.\nJust because he had to get up early doesn't mean I had to go to bed early. He's always been a morning person. I've always been a night owl. Now we usually go to bed at the same time but I read until we'll after he's asleep.\n\nFigure out what makes you comfortable to fall asleep. It's not his responsibility. It's yours.", "YTA\n\nListen,,, during many years I used to go to bed at the same time as my partner. And one day, I changed job and needed to be up earlier than him, so it means I needed to go to bed earlier than him as well. I couldn't sleep well nor sleep as fast as usual because i missed my partner at first.\n\nBUT ! Eventually i ended up being used to this rhythm, and now I can sleep without him being around.\n\nOP, you just need to force yourself. Everything is on you, and that is an as*hole move to put any responsibility on your husband.", "YTA, speaking from experience\u2026been married 23 years and my husband is the early riser. He\u2019s always wanted me to go to bed with him; however, I\u2019ve finally adjusted my sleep schedule and he absolutely hates it now lol.", "I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say YTA. He is, after all, your husband, not your roommate. I can understand having certain expectations when married. That said, it is possible to learn to fall asleep without him and maybe even prefer falling asleep alone. I believe the first step is challenging your belief that you absolutely cannot fall asleep and/or stay asleep without him beside you. When you\u2019re lying in bed ruminating about \u201cwhen is he coming to bed? I can\u2019t sleep without him beside me. I\u2019m going to be so tired tomorrow. He\u2019s so inconsiderate\u2026\u201d or some similar thought process, you\u2019re preventing your mind and body from relaxing. Try researching ways to help you fall asleep and experiment with things that might work for you. Ask your doctor for suggestions. Make sure you\u2019re not doing things that inadvertently keep you awake (like caffeine or exercise too close to bedtime). For years I didn\u2019t sleep well and certainly not enough because of medical issues. Now that I sleep better and longer, I can see how much that lack of sleep affected me. Do Not Disturb turns on at 7:30pm on my phone and I stay off social media, even though I\u2019m not going to bed for another 2-2 hours. I really try to avoid talking and texting with anyone after 7:30pm as well. When I lay my head on the pillow I don\u2019t think or worry about tomorrow, things that happened during the day, problems I\u2019m having, etc. I clear my mind and think of things I enjoy. I would talk with him and come up with a way that he can avoid waking you. That is inconsiderate,  especially if he knows he\u2019s disturbing your sleep and since he\u2019s choosing to go to bed later. \n\nAnother thought. Is it possible for you to pump milk and let him do the feeding in the middle of the night and maybe get up with them in the morning so you can get more rest? You could also try adjusting your children\u2019s sleeping schedule. Unless there\u2019s a reason not to, can they stay up later and sleep in longer?", "imo u r a grown person so yta and should seek therapy to develop better coping skills to sleep on ur own\n\n it is a problem that ur exhausted but its your sleep, your responsibility", "My husband and I have an incredibly similar sleep dynamic; instead of making it his problem I\u2019m a lighter earlier sleeper I started wearing an eye mask and ear plugs to bed.

I\u2019m a morning person and he is a night owl", "YTA. Why do you need him to fall asleep? You are not a child, you can sleep on your own! In fact, it is healthy to do so. If he isnt tired, then you will make his life miserable but you dont care as you are just being selfish", "YTA \n\nI say this as a wife who is an early to bed and early to rise with a night owl husband who almost never comes to bed at the same time as me. \n\nYou're an adult, not a baby who needs to be soothed to sleep by someone else. This isn't your husband's problem at all. It would be one thing if he stayed up late, slept in all morning and left you picking up the slack with the littles but you yourself said that's not the case. Lots of parents feel they need to stay up late to get the adult time at the end of the day, it's important for mental health and if that's how your husband is then that's what he needs to do to feel balanced in life.\n\nAlso... OP how on earth did you sleep while single? Have you always required the physical presence of other people to sleep?", "It sounds like what you are upset about is that you are stressed which is causing you to not sleep. to me it seems like the reason that you were able to sleep when he was in the bed was because you did calming activities which reduced your stress level. My guess is that it was the quality time that you were spending together that you are missing. If he came to bed didn't speak to you or look at you and just lay down and ask you not to touch him then you probably wouldn't be able to sleep either.  \n\n\nIt's not fair of you to put your lack of sleep on him since your sleep is not his responsibility but in your post it comes across like you think it is his responsibility/fault. I would recommend asking if you can do something relaxing together before bed and let him pick what you do.", "NTA! Some of these comments are so alarming.

It's completely up to you to figure out how to sleep on your own.", "I am gonna say YTA, kinda. Because your husband is a grown man he can very well sleep when he wants to. He will be miserable and probably resentful if he's told, as an adult man, to sleep early BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT HIM. I think this is YOUR issue that needs to be dealt with, more than his. So you need to proactively try to find out what will work in helping you sleep without him.\n\nI know it's miserable to not have good sleep. I am sorry you are exhausted during the day from the lack of sleep but may I suggest taking a sleeping aid? Say like a mix of magnesium and melatonin half an hour before bed? Learn about sleep hygiene. Seek a professional if needed.\n\nOr maybe even just a compromise and ask him to go to be with you 2x a week and wait til you pass out before he plays his games?", "I make a pillow spray with lavender oil and water and I feel it helps me sleep. No harm trying.", "Sometimes, when I don't want to go to bed alone, I just join him on the sofa, put my head on his lap and sleep while he games with his arm on my head.

He doesn't game and comes to bed and I make sure to stay up a little longer to catch a movie. \n6 other nights a week, he kisses me goodnight. I drool, he games. I would never demand he give up his hobby/stress reliever every night because I'm a codependent sleeper. Go see a therapist.", "YTA I'm sorry, I am extremely sympathetic, but this is very much a You Problem. If your husband capitulates and goes to bed with you he will be lying in the dark, staring at the ceiling for hours. Does that seem reasonable to you? Does is seem like that won't cause him problems? Because if you think that simply going to bed earlier means getting to sleep earlier, you couldn't be more wrong. You CAN sleep without your husband, but you choose to spend several hours lying awake obsessing about what he's doing in another room. It's entirely psychological, which is the definition of a You Problem. Firstly, you need to accept your husband needs less sleep than you. It's unfair, but that's life. Once you accept that, you may find it easier to stop obsessing about him enjoying himself away from you for a few hours a night. He's not rejecting you, he's just genetically programmed with different sleep requirements. It's not personal.", "I was in the other side of this in the early years of my marriage. I'm a night owl, my husband is not. He gets up at 4am. I tried to go to bed when he went to bed and would lay there for hours not being able to sleep and eventually get up. It was awful and caused me a lot of stress. I explained this to my husband and and we worked it out. Sometimes I would go to bed when he did and then get back up. That worked out pretty well. He didn't want to cause me stress, just liked sleeping with me.\n\nEventually he just accepted that I was never going to go to bed at 9pm. Been married almost 20 years now and he still goes to bed at 9 on weeknights and I'm up at least past midnight. I really enjoy my time after he goes to bed. I've always needed some alone time and that few hours every night is it since he works from home since Covid \n\nIt's unreasonable to make him responsible for your sleep and stressful for him I'm sure.  You'll need to figure that out on your own. How were you able to sleep before living with him?", "Babe, YTA here. As a nursing mom, I will grant that you do need your sleep, but people who are night owls and/or introverts need to stay up late and/or have alone time, as much as you need extra sleep. You have to find a new normal for yourself. If there is some kind of intimacy missing, ask for that, not that he make his bedtime routine match yours. He's not a teddy bear.", "YTA.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole thing with tiny babies about making sure they can self soothe and fall asleep by themselves.

In the meantime could he sleep on the couch or could you do separate beds?", "YTA. You are both allowed to pick your own bed times.

Your attitude towards this is appalling, and you sound exhausting to be around.", "YTA. It sounds as if he\u2019s with people (including you) all day and needs some time to himself, yet you want to take that away from him. As a night owl myself I can relate.

You're looking for an alternative solution to having him there, and having trouble finding one.\n\nI want to give you advice on how to go to sleep without him, but I never found a good one. On the one hand, he probably really does need the mental breaks in the evening, and you wouldn't want to steal that away or quality of life could go down the hole. On the other hand, you're getting worse... And worse... While he's managing some sort of equilibrium, yes? \n\nMaybe he could join you for a couple nights while you set a bedtime routine for yourself, then you could continue it on your own? Or even just... Cuddle with you instead of gaming for a while, for a few nights. You're both up anyway. See if that helps. (And if he can't handle that because he's jonesing for the game, that would be strange to me, as by the time we had two young children life shifted such that those indulgences couldn't be a regular thing anymore)\n\nIn my experience, it wasn't \"codependency\" but came from this very weird feeling of loneliness, focusing on either work or the children and not getting to enjoy *any* of the companionship I previously indulged in.

You say you cannot sleep without him but, before you met him, you slept without him right? You need to learn to sleep without him -- preferably in your own room. I don't get why anyone would want to stay up playing video games. It doesn't sound like a healthy habit to me but it's not fair for him to stop doing so just because you have a sleep issue. You need to work on your sleep issue. By the way, there's no shame in married couples sleeping in separate beds.

Our kids are very small and both wake up between 5am and 6am. \n\nMy husband is one of those magical people who can totally function on 5-6 hours of sleep just fine. I'm not. I need a full 7-8 or it literally ruins my day the following day.\n\nWe both work full time from home, and we're both full-contact parents. He's an amazing involved dad who truly does share the load at least 50%, and a really good husband. The only problem is bedtime. \n\nGiven that our waking hours are largely filled with work and kids, he wants to stay up LATE every night playing video games since it's really his only chance to do so. It's become a much worse problem since Starfield came out. Left to his own devices, he'd go to bed at 1 or 2am. The kids will wake up by 6am no matter what, so we can't shift what time we get up in the morning. Here's the kicker - I can't fall asleep well alone. \n\nHe wants me to go to bed alone when I'm tired around 10 while he stays up and enjoys his free time.\n\nThe problem is I CAN'T SLEEP. If he doesn't come to bed, I toss and turn for hours waiting for him. If I do miraculously fall asleep, he wakes me on the way in to bed using the bathroom, brushing his teeth, climbing into bed, etc. \n\nI'm routinely not getting anywhere near the amount of sleep I need. I start crying in the middle of the day because I'm so exhausted. My entire body hurts from how tired I am. I have begged, pleaded, come up with compromises, and nothing works - he just won't come to bed earlier. He'll say he's coming but then gets absorbed in his game and another hour will go by. I can't take a sleeping pill or anything because I'm breastfeeding on demand and need to be able to wake to the baby's cries at night. \n\nI'm so resentful that my physical needs aren't being met, but I understand his perspective that it's unfair that he should have to go to bed because I'm tired.

Do you have a spare bedroom that one of you could use so you're not in the \"waiting for him\" mentality?", "I can get that, it's just some people respond differently I suppose.
