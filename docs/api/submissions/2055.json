I asked her why she would even defend Gabrielle and she said she doesn't like jealous insecure women.

My mom asked why she cared and Alana explained it is disrespectful to try and upstage the bride and Gabrielle seems like the type who would do that.\n\nSo your fiancee obviously cannot read the room. She was trying to \"bond\" with your mom by insulting the \"other woman\".

And seriously sets your fiancee in a bad light. \n\nSo your dad is not in a committed loving relationship with Gabrielle, he is just having a mid-life crisis? \n\nOh and your mom must be terrible in bed if your dad had to settle for someone just \"ok\" looking? \n\nAnd your Fiancee is so insecure that she had to insult Gabrielle, who has done nothing to her but exist as part of your family. \n\nI get the feeling that you mom is not someone who is insecure at all and who does not normally put other women down about their appearance. I'm the same way. I also taught my kids that type of behavior is inappropriate. We do not make ourselves look good by putting other women down.

She is the bride. Anyone who tries to upstage her will get side eyed anyway. \n\nAnd then you uninvited your mom? Dude, that's an over reaction from one interaction that your fiancee started and deserved to get called out for. \n\nIt's not your mom's responsibility to make your fiancee feel good about herself. And putting another woman, who hasn't done anything to her, down to feel better is just not a good look at all. \n\nYTA and so is your fiancee.", "YTA does your mom even want to attend after this?

And she maybe is jealous a bit. You mention how she dislikes Gabrielle,  but don't say if it is warranted. \n\nI also think your mom could care less about how your wife felt. I think mom is not happy Gabrielle will be at the wedding and she took that out on your fiance.  After all, she would not have  to attend an event with Gabrielle if you were not marrying Alana (sarcasm, in case you couldn't tell). \n\nYour mom made it a point to tear her down.

Your fiance was at least talking about someone that wasn't there. By the way your mom's bf spoke up, it seems they have been ripping on your fiance for some time.
