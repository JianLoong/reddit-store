We\u2019re expecting in the next few weeks. \n\nShe works from home with our first son (M2) and I work six days a week. We\u2019re both really exhausted. All the time. When I come home, I try to take care of bathing, feeding, bedtime so she can rest, but she\u2019s nesting right now. What little time she can rest, she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried to give her space to do what she thinks is right, but her inability to relax is causing a lot of fights.\n\nLast night we had a serious talk where I told her we both need a day to chill. We agreed that today would be a day where we could both just stay home and relax. \n\nCut to this morning. She wakes me up to tell me we\u2019re out of bottled water and asked me to run to the store to get some. I don\u2019t like being woken up\u2014especially to work we agreed could wait\u2014but I said sure. \n\nHere\u2019s where the fighting starts. She asked me if I could get her food while I\u2019m out. I say \u201cI don\u2019t want to run all over town when we agreed today would be chill. I\u2019ll cook you something here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here I want.\u201d\n\nSo, I agreed to go pick up water, then go her food. She also asked me to go inside the steakhouse she wanted and make her salad by hand at the salad bar. Now I\u2019m getting annoyed, but I say okay and away I go. \n\nSince I\u2019m intermittent fasting, I can\u2019t eat anything for another few hours so I just get her and the baby food. I finally get back home and sit with her as she eats. She asks why I didn\u2019t get me anything and I tell her it\u2019s because I\u2019m fasting. \n\nShe got annoyed, saying that it makes her feel fat and selfish to be sitting there eating while I watch. I ask her if she wants me to leave and she gets upset saying that I did that to be passive aggressive. I brought up the fact that I didn\u2019t appreciate being sent on needless errands when we agreed today would be chill. We could have gotten water tomorrow.  I could have just cooked her a meal instead of running around town.  She absolutely lost it, bringing up every single thing she does for me every day. I sat and listened, but afterwards, I told her that I felt really disrespected and she got up and left. \n\nI know that this is about more than just this meal, but AITA here?

Pregnancy does this...not much you can do but continue to be supportive.", "NTA\n\nNext time, plan out your day off! \"Hey honey let's order delivery/Ubereats and then we can chill.\" Ubereats/doordash/postmates/etc. can cover almost any craving. \n\nThen you'll have a movie night, maybe take a walk, play video games, watch youtube, just whatever. No cleaning or cooking or stressing.\n\nSpecify this is a day of rest for both of you (or just for you, and she can have a day off from the kiddo another time - send him to either of your parents maybe?), and what you want a day like that to look like.\n\nI sure wouldn't want to go into a restaurant and make a salad by hand to take home... you're a true champion. She deserves a break, but so do you. I'd tell her your day of rest means staying home and not running out and doing stuff. You can make sure you're stocked the day before.\n\nShe's 8 months pregnant so it's better for you to be at home more for the big day anyways.", "NTA, she's pregnant and you're a guy. We would all lose that argument regardless of what we did lol", "NTA , she doesn\u2019t get a pass on being a considerate partner just because she is pregnant. She is being very rude and unappreciative.", "NAH, but I\u2019m confused.  You say \nin a comment that she was working.  This doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201cchill day\u201d for her if she was working.  There is nothing wrong with that - and with a toddler in the house, it\u2019s hard for both parents to have a true \u201cchill day\u201d as I recall, and it also doesn\u2019t sound like a chill day is a priority for her.\n\nIf you work 6 days a week, it\u2019s no wonder you are exhausted.  Wanting to lay low and relax is reasonable.  However, that schedule may leave her cleaning, organizing cooking, and doing other \u2018nesting\u2019 prep on her own.  She works and has a toddler.  She is also eight months pregnant and that alone is fatiguing.  The two of you may disagree on how much nesting has to happen, but she\u2019s probably doing everything she can knowing she\u2019s going to be so much more exhausted and busy in a month.\n\nIt sounds to me like you need to work as a team to problem solve a bit.  Each of you has reasonable desires.  Each of you needs to treat the other\u2019s desires as important.  She needs to care about your need to unwind and recover.  You need to respect her desire to be prepared for several months of sleeplessness, physical recovery, and occasional chaos by getting the physical environment in good shape.  You have to set expectations together, and also honor each other\u2019s desires and boundaries.  \n\nMaybe you could agree to spend certain blocks of time on duty for whatever tasks are at hand, and she could agree that other blocks of time are for chilling out - some for both of you together, but also blocks when she can do what she feels like song but is also free to do what she thinks she needs to.  Is she one of those people who believe they will  relax when everything  \u201cto do list\u201d is done (which it never is)?\n\nUnless her health is at risk, let her work when she wants to work.  It\u2019s incredible annoying to be told to relax when you are engaged in a project.  It\u2019s also annoying to be nagged to join in a project or pick up extra chores when you are relaxing. Agree to when you will join her in \u201cget stuff done\u201d mode, and when you won\u2019t be asked.", "INFO: is there a reason she asked you to go get the water and food instead of going herself?", "NAH\n\nPregnancy hormones are causing excess stress for her, and you did your best to be accommodating. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, even regardless of it being your \u201cchill\u201d day.", "NTA, but you gotta be real, with kids you\u2019ll never be able to \u201c just chill\u201d especially when you work 6 days.", "NTA - You are both exhausted and run off your feet. Sure, she gets extra points for being very very pregnant, but that does not mean that you are not a person or that you do not need rest. These things were things that could have waited. The fact that she cannot seem to acknowledge that her \"wants\" are not automatically \"needs\" just because she is pregnant is not ok. The fact that she thinks everything you do - even when you choose to eat - needs to revolve around her is also not ok.", "NAH. I understand why she\u2019s upset, since mealtimes are not just about sustenance, they\u2019re also about interpersonal connection and shared experience, and I\u2019m sure she wanted to share that time with you. \n\nThat said, I also think it\u2019s reasonable for you to be upset \u2014 you both agreed that this should be a day for rest, and that any errands should have been done the day before or allowed to wait until the next day. You should be able to communicate that to her. \n\nEmotions are high between you. Hormones don\u2019t help. To me it sounds like you\u2019ll need to find another day to rest, and make a plan for it so you can share a meal and not have to worry. I know that\u2019s way easier said than done, especially when you have a 2yo and one of you is pregnant, but these sound like more symptoms of frustration and exhaustion to me that could be alleviated by spending some time with one another without tasks looming over you.", "NAH. You definitely both deserve a day to relax, but the end stage of pregnancy is miserable and you legitimately can\u2019t control yourself or your emotions a lot of the time.", "NTA.  I'm old and can vaguely remember how hard life was with pregnancies and little ones.  I suspect that's 98% of what is going on here.  I think you should forget yesterday, hug and move on.\n\nIf you need to do more than just move on \"My love, we are both tired and stressed.  Let's just concentrate on being good to each other and help each other get through the days as happily as we can.\"", "NTA- making you go Into a steak house to use a salad bar is ridiculous. I\u2019d be annoyed if I was you. Ruined chill day.", "NTA! Her being pregnant is NOT an excuse for her to act this way.  Before anyone comes at me, I've been pregnant.  I looked like I was 9 months by 6 months and still did everything on my own.  I'm honestly sick of seeing people use pregnancy as an excuse to be a jerk.  It's not, she asked you to run errands that could have waited and she didn't have to eat out, she chose to.  Good luck.", "I don't live in the states, so I'm not sure how it works, but here you can have the bottled water delivered to your door directly and there are a lot of food places that deliver, beside Uber and Rappi that go get stuff for you.\n\nSo from my point of view, all this was moot and could have been avoided. But I don't know your particular circumstances, so probably not in your case.\n\nIn any case, NTA. You just need to be more patient. If she is nesting not only hormones are going haywire. They are telling her that if she doesn't get things done, right now, her baby is gonna die. It is not rational. And you can only do so much to center yourself even if you are fully aware it's the hormones messing with you. Because she's getting that message 24/7.\n\nIt might be the first thing she feels when she wakes up, and the last one before going to bed. So having a chill day probably sounded reasonable when you agreed to it... But then again, she woke up and her baby is gonna die if you don't get water in time. And she's craving something. Her body is building another while human being. Ran out of a certain material and cravings are how it let's her know... \n\nSo I don't think she and A neither.\n\nMaybe a way to compromise would be to get a physical calendar, mark a countdown to the estimated delivery date. She can write down a list of all the things that come to her mind that she needs/wants you to do before the baby comes. Then you'll write it in the calendar so she will feel heard and will have a visual reminder to let her know that even when you are not actively doing the thing right now you are aware of it and will get to it.\n\nReassure her you love her and have a candle light dinner. Even if it is left overs, make it romantic.", "NTA", "NTA for not eating with her, YTA for your attitude. She is 8 months pregnant and working and most likely cannot be on her feet moving and lifting then returning to work. I've ran out late at night to help with my wife's cravings, yeah it was inconvenient, but she's about to push a baby out, so I got over it.", "YTA so this chill day. Who got up with 2m and when? And I assume fed 2m? And when did she wake you for water? And if you cook, who cleans that up? How much is she still working at 8mos?\n\nAgain though, whose watching 2m? Mom is? Incredibly chill day for her.", "Inclining towards a soft YTA, she's 8 months pregnant and exhausted the picky eating makes sense. Also you say she was 'bringing up every single thing she does for me every day' - you're not disputing that she *does* do a lot for you every day? In which case it's fair she expects you to run a few errands.\n\nLike you say there's more going on here and it does sound like you're trying to help her out but maybe it just wasn't a fight worth starting.", "I feel like deciding to intermittently fast while your wife is 8 months pregnant alone should get you the YTA tag.", "NAH- This would be unreasonable behaviour from your wife if she were not 8 months pregnant with a toddler, but dude, she is 8 MONTHS PREGNANT (with a toddler) - this is actually very low key.

Get used to it, stop complaining, suck it up, it won't be forever, welcome to being a dad.\n\nShe is being flooded with pregnancy hormones, which affect how she thinks and feels in addition to how her body grows.

You both agreed to relax and what not. So I could see the frustration. Although I would have tried to be nicer to the pregnant lady.  Then I read your comments. It wasn\u2019t a chill day for her. She was still working and taking care of your oldest. That isn\u2019t a chill day for her. Then you remark,\u201d well she can do her job from bed\u201d, she is still working.

Hahaha. What the hell were you thinking? I'm laughing so hard at the moment Thank you for that.", "... She guilted you all the way into having to go inside the steakhouse and make her salad, by hand?\n\nNTA, by far.

Then she discovered that we were out of water. She is not the type of person who can just chill and let that be for another day.\n\nEDIT: I misread your comment. No, she could run errands if she wants but she\u2019s at the point where she\u2019s too exhausted. Plus, she was on the l clock when she asked.", "Interesting. Seems like it kind of bypasses all communication, but I\u2019ll give it a shot.", "Sorry, no. I\u2019ve been intermittent fasting for years.", "I guess we never really hard defined it. Maybe we should have. My version of chilling is just staying home. Maybe doing some chores around the house, but Definitley not running around town", "Good ideas! Appreciate it.", "no problem, and congrats! something that could be really nice if you can make it work would be a weekend together(ASAP, since there\u2019s only a few weeks til due date). if you can get someone to watch your son, ask her if she\u2019d like to spend a night in a hotel. you two can spend saturday & sunday with just the two of you. away from the house, so there are no errands or chores, away from the toddler. it\u2019ll give you two a chance to rest & reconnect before things get crazy(i think some folks call this a babymoon). this is the last chance for such a thing for a quite a while, & would be a nice memory for when you\u2019re up at 3AM with a screaming newborn, lol. congrats again!", "You didn't specify whether she meant her paid job only, which is why I asked the question.", "She was working? I thought you said you'd agreed it was a day for you both to relax. Is your tap water safe?", "So she was watching the toddler and working?", "When pregnancy hormones are in effect it can lead to huge breakdowns in communication that aren't her fault. She will be more appreciative of you being flexible and will let you have more freedom later on. I went on late night snack runs and change any blowouts our daughter has and I get to golf once a week.", "I think you\u2019re NTA, but next time I think you could take a few arbitration tips to prevent. She\u2019s exhausted, you\u2019re exhausted. Define what chill means for you guys - she might not have thought you were being inconvenienced if that\u2019s what chill means to her. I would also cut her some slack on the eating with you thing. Sometimes if people are nauseated or not feeling well it\u2019s the environment that makes eating feel better. I would compromise by saying next time \u201chey, I am trying to fast right now but maybe we can do something special for this meal\u201d or give her a heads up before you pick up the food you\u2019re not going to eat with her.", "I get that. I\u2019m not even checking the mail if I\u2019m having a chill day. They\u2019re so few and far between.", "Also, if this helps, I've noticed eating times are sensitive for a lot of pregnant people. I think this is because 1) their body really needs it 2) the changes in their body makes them self-conscious 3)meals are usually considered a bonding experience and time", "Gotcha. Yes she agrees that her day to day is way less stressful than mine", "Our tap waters safe. She can work on and off from her home office or the bed. Her work is not a typical cause of stress.", "Okay. My personal opinion as someone who was very recently in a similar situation to your wife: NAH, because your wife probably needs a break in forms that just don't make sense to you right now. Maybe that's a distraction or feeling like issues are settled. You feel like she needs to chill, she's probably really irritated that you're trying to tell her how to manage the extreme frustration of parenting a toddler while hella pregnant."]}
