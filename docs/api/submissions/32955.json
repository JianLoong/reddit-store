It was as amicable as these things can be and they've worked hard to have a good, co-operative parenting relationship; both would describe the other as a friend.

She has amazing stories to tell and is just a really warm human being.\n\nNow the issue. Jane and Zara recently announced Zara is pregnant. Obviously via sperm donor. The kids seem excited and I'm happy for Jane and Zara. My husband on the other hand has been off since the announcement. I've tried to get him to talk about what was bothering him but he can't articulate it.

I shut that down. I have no desire to be pregnant and never have. Then he suggested adoption. I asked where all this was coming from as we'd always agreed no more kids for us. He said \"this whole things is going to end in tears\" and that \"using a sperm donor to get pregnant is ridiculous\".\r\n\nI was conscious of the kids in the other room and told him to stop before the kids heard him.

There will be a child that he has absolutely no link with AND it means he's not the Alpha anymore. He may have thought that his ex being with a woman meant it wasn't a \"real\" relationship. It's pretty common unfortunately...", "NTA. Why would his ex have to consult with him before having a child with their new spouse? Unless the children from his ex are concerned about having another sibling, I don't see the issue. I'm sure they took that into account though, especially since it was obviously a planned pregnancy.", "I'm sorry, but who the hell does your husband think he is? I'm offended for the ex and her wife, the kids, and you. There are some unresolved feelings there, and I don't know if it's all just homophobia or if he still has feelings for his ex.  But this isn't okay, and he need to check himself real quick. Definitely not the asshole, OP.", "NAH He\u2019s dealing with or not dealing with this news not very well for whatever reason. He probably doesn\u2019t even know why. It disrupted his worldview or whatever. He needs help processing these feelings with someone outside of the family. He needs to figure out what\u2019s wrong and express himself without judgment. Encourage him to seek counseling.", "NTA - The fact that your husband is almost obsessed with the pregnancy news is a bit concerning, especially since everyone else is fine with it. Perhaps there are some jealousy issues cropping up, as he seems to want to compete with them by having another child. He definitely needs counseling, but this may cause some additional issues in your marriage.", "NTA he seems weirdly insulted he hasn't been asked to provide the sperm sample", "NTA\n\nInsist on couples therapy.  Insist.  Don't let this derail your marriage or ruin your relationship with the coparents.", "Was he OK with Jane and Zara before the pregnancy? I guess he's allowed to feel kinda \"off\" or weird about it, but shouldn't let it carry over to the kids. I think you are correct that it might help for him to see a counselor.\n\nNAH", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nWhat has his knickers all knotted up? He's married to you! He's not with Jane anymore, and it's not ever the ex-wife is pregnant, it's Zara!\n\nHe's absolutely throwing homophobia and misogyny out in spades with his \"disapproval\". \n\nThank you for trying to stop this behavior before he escalates.", "NTA\n\nYou mentioned that his reaction seems to be stemming from misogyny and homophobia, and I think you are correct in that. \n\nIt\u2019s just a guess on my part, but I think that he probably was assuming that his ex-wife\u2019s relationship with her new spouse was \u201cjust a phase\u201d. The fact that they are introducing a new child into the mix, is putting the reality of their relationship up front and centre. Again, just a guess on my part, but the fact that he could be \u201creplaced\u201d by a woman is probably hurting how he views his masculinity.\n\nI am saying these things, because I had an ex, whose daughter was a lesbian, and he could not handle that truth. He kept saying it was just a phase. The attitudes of the two men, both my ex, and your husband seem to be very similar.\n\nand good on you for trying to nip that in the bud before it goes too far. Definitely I would insist on therapy for both of you together.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s throwing a temper tantrum.  Ridiculous.\n\nWhy does he now want you to get pregnant do you think?\n\nWondering if he\u2019s jealous of ex for having a baby with new wife as well?", "NTA but he is", "Definitely NTA. You should INSIST on some couple\u2019s therapy with him. Nip this in the bud before it becomes a full-blown problem.", "NTA. Sorry about your husband's bigotry. That's a really gross attitude he has.", "> from what he has said his issue with Zara's pregnancy seems rooted in **homophobia/misogyny/racism**.\n\nNTA, and I agree with shutting down hubby and his issues. You don't explicitly say in the post, but assuming from this comment that Zara is also a different race, but none of these three are things that he should be instilling in the children. Have Jane and Zara picked on his vibes?", "Husband is upset he wasn't asked to be the sperm donor.", "That's what I'm thinking.

That's what his problem is. They used a sperm donor and he's right there.", "Maybe? That would be kind of weird though. I could see why they went with someone else, or a random guy instead.", "It sort of feels to me like he thinks he has three wives now and this is a kick to realize that no they aren\u2019t his family like that anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour husband thinks they should have asked for his sperm. \n\nHe thinks he\u2019s the alpha male of this wider family unit, and he\u2019s just found out he\u2019s not! \ud83d\ude02", "Clearly NTA. Your husband needs to talk to someone so he can (at minimum) articulate his feelings. Seeing a friend go through something similar, it turned out her ex-husband didn't view her same sex marriage as \"real\" or at the same level as his second marriage. He thought they were \"playing house\". When they announced they were pregnant his real beliefs came out. He didn't approve of same sex marriages or interracial relationships or Black babies. Sadly it became a legal matter when he sued for full custody. After he lost, he tried to alienate the children from their mom, stepmom, and baby sister. If you can, get your husband into therapy. Don't let it fester because that type of thinking can go bad really fast. Also, the let's have a baby thing is crazy. If appropriate double check your birth control.", "NTA. Your husband seems to think his ex wife's new baby somehow has something to do with him, and it doesn't. His behavior is inappropriate, and you were correct to call him out and shut it down. He needs to stop. It's not a competition and it's not his business.", "Why on earth should they have consulted him first? He's not a king.\n\nAnd why would he go from complaining that they were bringing another child into the mix, to immediately asking if you two could do so too?\n\nNTA, but there's a lot of irrationality to unpack there.", "Right now, this is still his family. He has half of the control because the children are half his. Once his ex has her own kids in the mix, with none of his genes or parenting involved, it will change the dynamic and the shared kids won\u2019t always be the center of attention / main focus of the family as a whole. I can see how this would be scary, but if he\u2019s not willing to work through the feelings and keeps acting this way, there will be major problems.", "NTA and I agree with the top comment insisting on couple's therapy. This way you can be present to ensure he talks about this issue and, if he's being stubborn still, you can talk about it and relay his gross comment about how he should have been consulted (WTF?). And what concerns you have re misogyny, homophobia, and racism, because I think you're right on the money. Obviously, don't shame him because it will not go well, but you have to be honest so the therapist can really address his issues.\n\nI would also bring up in therapy how his solution was for you two to have a baby, which is one of the worst possible reasons to bring a child into the world. And no woman should sacrifice her body and career on the alter of a man's bigotry and ego.   \n\nThis would be a hill to die on for me though.", "NTA. You had every right to shut down his antics. And you shouldn't apologize. He needs to address his feelings in therapy and not take them out on you.", "NTA- Yeah sounds like he's got issues. Maybe he felt like he has some kind of \"ownership\" of his ex through their kids, or he's just homophobic and doesn't think gay people should have kids. Or both. It also seems like a weird power play to say you guys should have a kid, like he's trying to make this a competition or something. Don't apologize, he was completely in the wrong and it's inappropriate to speak that way in front of his kids. He needs to go to therapy to figure out why he has such a problem with this and work on managing his emotions.", "How often does your husband talk to Jane or Zara without you? He seems jealous of starting their own journey of a child together and almost like he\u2019s being abandoned. The story would make sense if he was a teenager and this was his parent\u2019s second marriage or something like that but for an ex husband it\u2019s definitely odd\u2026", "Your wording is spot on.\n\nThis is jealousy. That's why he suggested you have a baby.\n\nHe is at risk of spoiling  the sort of relationship most step parents / parents would think is great.

He is embarrassing himself. Weird alpha beta misogyny shit going on, plus homophobia. He needs to focus on you and the kids. Also bringing up yall having a kid in response\u2026.what is this a contest???? Why is wanting to talk to the kids about this in a negative way?

Then he suggested adoption.\n\nHe needs to understand that adding another child will not solve whatever issue he has; it also seems incredibly selfish of him if he cannot even explain to you why he's having a problem in the first place (a child is a commitment, not some band-aid to fix his problems). He must address this with a therapist and *fast* (that baby is coming in 9 months). \n\nHe needs to get to the true issue at hand, preferably before Jane & Zara (and/or the kids) find out/overhear. While it's great that he has a good co-parenting situation with his ex, he has no say/control in what Jane and her wife decide to do and he needs to get that.", "NTA. And unfortunately the fact that you all stayed so close has resulted in him feeling like he actually should get some say in what his ex and her wife plan for family planning, which is 100% wrong. He definitely needs to get his shit together and get over that because he's about to ruin what has been a great thing. His jealousy and insecurity are winning and it's not a good look.", "\u201cHe should have been consulted..\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry, what the actual fuck. \n\nI didn\u2019t consult my ex before I had a baby. Only an insane person would expect such a thing. \n\nNTA OP but\u2026girl.", "You married an asshole. He thinks he has the right to decide if his EX-wife can have more children. He is beyond vile to think he can control women. He wants to decide when and how women can have babies. I really hope he doesn't treat his daughter with such blatant sexism. I hope he raised his daughter to think of herself as more than a womb that must be told when she will be pregnant. NTA but your husband is in so many ways.", "NTA.

Your asshat of a husband is already poisoning your family!!", "NTA. Tell him to spell out exactly what his issue is, Reddit needs to know", "NTA, but until he can articulate *why* he\u2019s cross about the pregnancy, I\u2019d hold off making too much judgment on his anticipated reasons. \n\nI think the family therapy is a great idea for the kids anyway, and bonus so husband can get the help he needs to sort through his own issues.", "I chose to be a single mother by choice and used an anonymous sperm donor. I have encountered a few men (not many) who are threatened by this.

NTA.", "NTA honestly, you should show him this post and the comments. Does he even know why he's acting like this? I'd like to assume since there haven't been problems before that this is triggering something for him that he's not recognizing. He needs to take stock of this reaction and evaluate it. Brene Brown calls it \"minding the gap between values and behavior\". I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt (based on your description of your arrangement) that this behavior does not reflect his real values.", "Nta he's mad he doesn't have control over his ex wife anymore.

Does he think the kids will want to spend more time with Jane and Zara if there is a baby there?\n\nYou and Jane and zara all sound pretty amazing.  But your husband needs to find a way back to sanity.", "NTA OP and I can see no reason for you to apologize.  He is apparently jealous of the fact that his ex-wife and her new wife are having a child that he has no part of.  He needs some serious therapy and needs to get over himself.

He didn\u2019t feel displaced\u2026til now. Which is obviously wrong but was likely subconscious. He thought he had things figured out in a way that protected his ego and comfort. Now that\u2019s pulled away. \n \nAnyway. He needs therapy. Insist on it.", "NTA your husband is being a homophobic dick whether he realizes it or not. Zara\u2019s pregnancy has nothing to do with him at all whatsoever it\u2019ll impact the kids life and if he\u2019s got such an issue with it he doesn\u2019t have to be around the baby.

He is single father figure those kids have - if he will not step into this role for new kid you will judge him as AH. \n\nYou said you celebrate everything together everything - up until now he had to worry only about his kids. For example Christmas gifts where all focused on \"common\" kids. What you all (but especially him ) do now ? Do not buy new kid different amount of gifts or different value ( I buy gifts for my friends kids but I obviously spend much more on gifts for my own ) - he only has 2 choice - treat the kid as his own (which is not) or be judge as AH. \n\nHe really is in tragic situation - treating new child as his own when it's not will be judge as controlling misogyny or will meet \"you do not have a vote it is not your child\".

He is scared that the fragile but stable co-parenting thing they've built is going to change. How much slack will he have to pick up because they just had a baby? He has no reason to care about their baby in any way, but he will have to care if he wants there to be peace. He will have to care for as long as his children are living under his roof. He will risk having to do trips here and there because his ex and Zara can't be arsed due to baby (pickup, holidays, appointments etc). It is obtuse not to see these things. He feels violated and pushed aside as he risks losing a lot, and gaining nothing, due this new baby. He wants equal ground again, that is why he wants another child now, to make it even again. So that they won't have a \"baby\" get out of jail free card whenever they don't want to do something. F*ck off with your misogyny, homophobia and harem theories, they are REALLY far fetched.

Right now you do a lot of things together.  Maybe - he doesn't want to spend time with his ex wife's kid.

And now his *ex-wife* is on the same level as him???\n\nI think he *never* thought that any of these women were his equal - by virtue of his nature as the male (non-child-bearing parent).\n\nMisogyny is leaking from this guy. This is why he can't articulate it - because he knows how effed up it is.\n\nOP, if you read this; you need to tell Jane what is going on in the household of her children and with her co-parent. You have a duty of care to the kids. But be aware this whole situation could blow t.f. up. \n\nYour husband needs to 'man up' and get therapy to figure out what is going on in HIS mind and with HIS emotions. They're his to deal with, not the responsibility of women to cope with.

Try and work this out with him assuming that's not it. You are almost certainly to get more \"out there\" thoughts from folks not involved in the situation.

Ew.", "it\u2019s because now his kids will be blood related to her kid. it was all fine until the, ah, \u201ccross contamination\u201d happened. trust me, I know that first hand", "I\u2019m a bi woman so my first thought was \u2018the pregnancy is a surprise to him and the kids but clearly using donor sperm and assisted conception is planned, so who is telling the kids what?\u2019\n\nBecause having seen multiple wlw couples have babies there is SO MUCH discussing sperm. I\u2019m childfree and good god, holidaying recently with the new mums of such a baby who knew their donor and met up with his sister on the trip, it was a bunch of very detailed sperm chat and actually quite intense medical info. I am squeamish and phobic about pregnancy and childbirth and a lot of the \u2018simple\u2019 info still involves much chat about egg retrieval, general anaesthesia, needles poking ovaries, embryos, and stuff akin to surgical language for kids.\n\nI have had a lot of surgery so hats off to people doing this but to know you are spending that amount of money (did it impact any college funds down the line for eg?), all the hormonal stuff and potential emotional stuff and will the kids all know the same info about the donor? Will the baby be aware early on that their donor isn\u2019t their siblings\u2019 dad because that can cause issue this way round that the kids blend where adults did not? Will the donor be involved? Will his kids know it is a donor but not to tell younger kid? Will husband now be co-ordinating 3 kids who are related by marriage, one ex, one wife, one \u2018wife in law\u2019 and himself and a donor all having family commitments and inputs to co ordinate?\n\nWhat about the impact on custody/guardianship if the bio mom of the older kids dies and they have parental rights to the younger too? Do they have parental rights? The custody, co-parenting and legalities of each permutation of donor conceived same sex wlw pregnancies are something any reputable clinic goes through in all aspects here first. And if they DIY\u2019d it then that is a legal can of worms.\n\nSo yes I can think of a bunch of reasons not related to homophobia, racism or misogyny that the bio parent of two of the kids might react to not having had any preparation to tell the clearly very settled secured kids that they are getting a planned sibling that is of course going to change this very unique and still quite stigmatised dynamic. \n\nI understand them not wanting to announce until the 12 weeks but the kids were totally unaware their mom was planning or possibly could bring a sibling into this family and there\u2019s a fairly big age gap, the news is right before Christmas and dad (and you OP) got no heads up to prepare to support the kids. It\u2019s Zara\u2019s first kid and there will be some bio versus step issues no matter how blended and not even mentioning this was a possibility until there\u2019s only 6 months til the baby is here is a lot.\n\nThis is all stuff wlw pregnancy and TTC groups advise not to do in blended families and as because there is often some adjusting unique to wlw couples about carrying and non carrying parents that needs care in addressing with existing kids and the couples who can seriously struggle when a much wanted baby arrives and the general chat is genetically loaded in a way \u2018which parent does he take after?\u2019 often isn\u2019t in other couples. This can have a big disruptive impact of existing bio kids who can panic that their bio parents aren\u2019t bio and they\u2019ve been lied to (this is more common with kids a bit too young to grasp the biology) but also brings up waves of issues about why their parents aren\u2019t together and \u2018if mummy loves this baby that isn\u2019t related, does that mean she could love kid\u2019s friend and now they are a sibling too?\u2019\n\nThis is all stuff that I\u2019ve seen and heard other queer women with kids come across and nearly every time they already had a good coparenting dynamic but didn\u2019t flag they hoped to have kids and how to co-parent that extra blend wit their co parent, it has caused even immediate upset. And equally with other mums not any men getting territorial etc like this thread had gone down.\n\nNAH yet but on a bunch of small ways your lives just altered with no warning. Like baby is due early next summer? Did all your PTO, vacation and custody plans just alter? Dad might be thinking of that kind of stuff which his ex wife and her spouse informed him of. Not co parent. Just announced a total dynamic shift without a word of heads up. Some families really run blended stuff this far ahead when it involves extended family. Does he have to now work out what the couple are comfortable with his family knowing about their reproductive decisions and run interference with them and the kids? That\u2019s a lot.\n\nIs it possible to talk to their expectant moms a bit further to try to drill down on practicalities versus him suddenly having a massive personality shift to show a bunch of hidden prejudices? He sounds blindsided and people are immediately assuming the worst because it\u2019s a same sex couple not a cishet one having had fertility treatment without even mentioning it until a baby is on the way to the split custody co parent.", "They\u2019re on their own journey lol", "It sounds like even he doesn't know what's driving it, or at least not consciously or in any way he's willing to admit. \n\nSince it sounds like it's rooted in race, gender, and sexual preference - and since you've said he's previously stood up to intolerance from his family - he might be scared to admit that deep down, he might not be the person he wants to be or says he is", "[removed]", "He wasn't dropped for her though.

Now the wife is pregnant it has proved that they are just as much a family as the one he had with her and that he's 'useless' because women can get pregnant without a man. I used a sperm donor for my youngest child (I am a straight female, just single). Ask him if he'd still be weirded out by a straight woman using a sperm donor. You'll know if he's being homophobic then. Asking you to get pregnant or adopt is also weird. I'd say his 'friendship' with them is more than that in his mind and he's strangely enmeshed. I'd be reconsidering my marriage or at least insisting on therapy if my husband was so interested in his ex's life.", "Time for hubby to peddle his kiester to a therapist and talk about it all.\n\nNTA.

You\u2019re 100% doing the right thing and defending your family unit from his bigotry. I hope he pulls his head out of his ass soon.

The ex-husband expecting to be consulted is rather laughably AH, though", "He needs therapy. Ask him if he doesn't get a grip on this bitterness invading his, up to this point, very good life  does he really invision it ending well? Does he really want to possibly permanetly damage all the relationships in his life? NTA", "He needs to go see a therapist because he is de*d wrong. The audacity of him thinking that Zara should consult with him before getting pregnant is ridiculous. She doesn\u2019t need to get his permission for anything. And then somehow he thinks it will magically fix everything if you get pregnant. He has lost his mind. Good for you telling him to shut the drama down and not spew that crap to his kids which are perfectly fine with Zara being pregnant.", "NTA... could it be jealousy?  He wants another baby? Or he is jealous for his children? I wonder if he knows why it bothers him.", "NTA. Since you\u2019re also have a great relationship with Jane and Zara, give them a heads up so they can talk to the kids.  Maybe just \u201cHusband seems uncomfortable with your pregnancy, he won\u2019t say why.  The kids and I are so happy for you, but I don\u2019t know if husband might say something to confuse them.

Does he want to have one up on them, I can't figure this out. And why do you say racist too?", "NTA He sounds super insecure about his ex-wife moving on with a woman and having a kid with her now wife. Probably he feels emasculated and is lashing out with homophobia. I think you should strongly encourage your husband to go to therapy. if he refuses, I would inform Jane and Zara becase he might be repeating these things to the children. But NTA, this is unacceptable behavior and you are right to shut it down.", "He really does need to talk it out - but it should be in individual therapy. He needs to be heard for all his craziness, then led back to a more sane approach. After he clarifies what's in his head, then the two of you can revisit things.", "If he also wants you two to have a kid he wants to break the spot light from their baby. Jealousy. In his mind his ex wife never \"moved on\" or never actually got into a \"real\" relationship because it was with a woman and not with a man. And now them having a baby makes it a \"real\" relationship. More Jealousy. I've heard a lot of guys talking about how they would rather their ex get with a woman than with another guy. Dude Is messed in the head and needs seriously therapy, he obviously never moved on and didn't see the relationship she has with her new lady friend as seriously before", "NTA Family therapy ASAP", "NTA if your husband has some kind of fear his kids will be abandoned he needs to address them with his ex & Zara. If thus is some stupid competition with Zara & his ex then he needs to get over himself.", "Why he feels like he's entitled to being consulted about anything regarding their relationship is absolutely bonkers to me. I think he's upset that he wasn't asked to be the donor.", "NTA. \nHe sounds jealous to me. He's jealous of Zara . Why does he all of a sudden want a kid to? Out of spite ? That's what jealous people do. The question is why is he jealous? He said  \"we already have 2 kids\".  .... Who's \"WE\" . \nHe finds sperm donor ridiculous. How else are they supposed to do it. Was he expecting Zara to ask him to be the sperm donor ? \n\nThen he goes on to say he should have been consulted but then turns around and says you get pregnant too ? I thought consulting was important?? He literally contradicted himself.\n\nStraight up ask him what are you jealous about.

He probably has some issues regarding sperm donor (which he is denying) and adding another baby to your extended family that doesn't have any shared DNA with him and Jane. Crazy. What if Jane had adopted (which she will do with Zara's Bio baby), would he have accepted that child? Maybe he still has some unresolved issues about Jane being a mother to any child that isn't his Bio kid. Therapy may help you both to resolve these issues before this newest member arrives because everyone deserves to be an equal member.", "I wonder if he\u2019s worried about his kids getting shut out a bit from his ex-wife. Things might be a little more imbalanced now because everyone is used to working together.

Dude has unresolved feelings.", "NTA what an out of pocket reaction.  Does he honestly think he gets a say in what happens in their home?", "Is it possible that your husband saw his ex entering into a same sex relationship as a \u2018safe\u2019 alternative?  Meaning that his contribution of procreation and the only man in the equation was protected.. and now that procreation is happening without him he is now facing for the first time his realization that his place in his ex\u2019s life has been eclipsed?  I feel like this isn\u2019t as much based in misogyny as I dealt with feelings of abandonment.  NTA for pointing out that he\u2019s not dealing with his feelings.  He can\u2019t go damaging the family dynamic because he has baggage to unpack here.  He really should seek some therapy to process it.", "Is it possible his sperm was used, but they didn\u2019t say anything or maybe Zara were having an affair and that is why this whole \u201csperm donor thing is ridiculous\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m usually not the one to jump to an affair conclusion either.

And don't apologise; you have nothing to apologise for.", "I feel like he thought all 3 women were \"his\" and this is proof that they aren't.

He cannot. \n\nLet's try small exercise - let's assume he did not say those things or he was not able to articulate his feelings. What are his options?\n\nMy thought process - he is only father figure around. New kid will most likely look at him as father figure especially that his siblings are. The mom's will most likely not want him too involved as it is not his kid. How long it is gonna take for him being branded AH or other label ? If he assumes father figure role as soon he will do things father would do that would not go lightly to with mom he will be met with \"not your child AH\" and he for sure will especially that he will do/done same with his own children. If he will not assume father figure role - first time he will refuse to take kid with him  on a trip though everybody else wants (kids + moms) will be the time ? first time he refuses to have Christmas together (though everybody else wants )? First time when be refuses to buy gifts if same value ? first time ...fill the blank... Etc etc. Especially that I do not necessarily see a strong support from his wife (the OP)\n\nAll I am saying - without judging or even referring to what are his words based on OP point of view is that the guy is screwed and has no way out.
