Fake names etc. \n\nI (35f) have a husband (41) and two wonderful bonus kids (12f) & (14m). My husband has 50/50 custody with his ex-wife (Jane 40). Some background: my husband and his ex divorced a little over 10-yrs ago. It was as amicable as these things can be and they've worked hard to have a good, co-operative parenting relationship; both would describe the other as a friend. I met my husband 6 yrs ago and we married 4.5 yrs ago. His ex and their kids welcomed me with open arms. When his ex met and then married her now-wife (Zara - 32f) the same was true in reverse. Our two households combine for birthdays and major holidays and generally at least one parent from each household is present for school plays, sports matches etc (unless the kids ask for time with just mum & dad in which case Zara and I bow out). I've always felt very fortunate that our families got along so well. I genuinely like Jane and Zara and honestly Zara is kinda badass. She's a doctor and worked with MSF and is also widely travelled. She has amazing stories to tell and is just a really warm human being.\n\nNow the issue. Jane and Zara recently announced Zara is pregnant. Obviously via sperm donor. The kids seem excited and I'm happy for Jane and Zara. My husband on the other hand has been off since the announcement. I've tried to get him to talk about what was bothering him but he can't articulate it. I asked if he wanted to speak to a family therapist (we saw one before we married just to help ease the transition to a blended family) but he didn't like the idea. I've started to lose my patience with him because from what he ***has*** said his issue with Zara's pregnancy seems rooted in homophobia/misogyny/racism.\r\n\nYesterday, I was making dinner and he again started grumbling about how Zara's pregnancy wasn't right; how he should have been consulted; how he didn't understand why they needed to have another kid when we already have 2 amazing kids etc. Then he told me we should try to have a baby as well. I shut that down. I have no desire to be pregnant and never have. Then he suggested adoption. I asked where all this was coming from as we'd always agreed no more kids for us. He said \"this whole things is going to end in tears\" and that \"using a sperm donor to get pregnant is ridiculous\".\r\n\nI was conscious of the kids in the other room and told him to stop before the kids heard him. He started getting genuinely cross and said the kids had a right to know \"what was actually going on\" and that he felt like he was in the twilight zone and he was the only sane one left.\r\n\nI lost my temper and told him that whatever issues he had with Zara's pregnancy were his problem, that I and the kids were genuinely happy for her and Jane and that this family had no space his made-up drama. That made him really cross and things were tense for the rest of the night.\r\n\nI feel like I should probably apologise for the phrasing but I don't want to apologise for the sentiment.

There will be a child that he has absolutely no link with AND it means he's not the Alpha anymore. He may have thought that his ex being with a woman meant it wasn't a \"real\" relationship. It's pretty common unfortunately...", "NTA. Why would his ex have to consult with him before having a child with their new spouse? Unless the children from his ex are concerned about having another sibling, I don't see the issue. I'm sure they took that into account though, especially since it was obviously a planned pregnancy.", "I'm sorry, but who the hell does your husband think he is? I'm offended for the ex and her wife, the kids, and you. There are some unresolved feelings there, and I don't know if it's all just homophobia or if he still has feelings for his ex.  But this isn't okay, and he need to check himself real quick. Definitely not the asshole, OP.", "NAH He\u2019s dealing with or not dealing with this news not very well for whatever reason. He probably doesn\u2019t even know why. It disrupted his worldview or whatever. He needs help processing these feelings with someone outside of the family. He needs to figure out what\u2019s wrong and express himself without judgment. Encourage him to seek counseling.", "NTA - The fact that your husband is almost obsessed with the pregnancy news is a bit concerning, especially since everyone else is fine with it. Perhaps there are some jealousy issues cropping up, as he seems to want to compete with them by having another child. He definitely needs counseling, but this may cause some additional issues in your marriage.", "NTA he seems weirdly insulted he hasn't been asked to provide the sperm sample", "NTA\n\nInsist on couples therapy.  Insist.  Don't let this derail your marriage or ruin your relationship with the coparents.", "Was he OK with Jane and Zara before the pregnancy? I guess he's allowed to feel kinda \"off\" or weird about it, but shouldn't let it carry over to the kids. I think you are correct that it might help for him to see a counselor.\n\nNAH", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nWhat has his knickers all knotted up? He's married to you! He's not with Jane anymore, and it's not ever the ex-wife is pregnant, it's Zara!\n\nHe's absolutely throwing homophobia and misogyny out in spades with his \"disapproval\". \n\nThank you for trying to stop this behavior before he escalates.", "NTA\n\nYou mentioned that his reaction seems to be stemming from misogyny and homophobia, and I think you are correct in that. \n\nIt\u2019s just a guess on my part, but I think that he probably was assuming that his ex-wife\u2019s relationship with her new spouse was \u201cjust a phase\u201d. The fact that they are introducing a new child into the mix, is putting the reality of their relationship up front and centre. Again, just a guess on my part, but the fact that he could be \u201creplaced\u201d by a woman is probably hurting how he views his masculinity.\n\nI am saying these things, because I had an ex, whose daughter was a lesbian, and he could not handle that truth. He kept saying it was just a phase. The attitudes of the two men, both my ex, and your husband seem to be very similar.\n\nand good on you for trying to nip that in the bud before it goes too far. Definitely I would insist on therapy for both of you together.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s throwing a temper tantrum.  Ridiculous.\n\nWhy does he now want you to get pregnant do you think?\n\nWondering if he\u2019s jealous of ex for having a baby with new wife as well?", "NTA but he is", "Definitely NTA. You should INSIST on some couple\u2019s therapy with him. Nip this in the bud before it becomes a full-blown problem.", "NTA. Sorry about your husband's bigotry. That's a really gross attitude he has.", "> from what he has said his issue with Zara's pregnancy seems rooted in **homophobia/misogyny/racism**.\n\nNTA, and I agree with shutting down hubby and his issues. You don't explicitly say in the post, but assuming from this comment that Zara is also a different race, but none of these three are things that he should be instilling in the children. Have Jane and Zara picked on his vibes?", "Husband is upset he wasn't asked to be the sperm donor.", "That's what I'm thinking. He's jealous that his ex is having another child, and now he wants another one too.", "I think this is it too", "So misogyny with a side of homophobia?", "I think this is it.\n\nHe just realized she's moved on with her life.", "I think he thinks he should have been the donor", "He's mad he's not the father. That's what his problem is. They used a sperm donor and he's right there.", "Maybe? That would be kind of weird though. I could see why they went with someone else, or a random guy instead."]}
