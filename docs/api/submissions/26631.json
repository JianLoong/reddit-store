Growing up I spent most Sundays with my mother and/or grandmother in the kitchen cooking a big meal for the whole family. \n\nWhen I met my wife we were young and she thought my love for cooking was a little weird for a guy, but she quickly grew to enjoy the benefits. At the time she would tease me for watching cooking shows but eventually they grew on her as well. Now if we are watching TV together, we are watching a cooking show. She especially likes the competitive ones, shows like Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Masterchef, Next Level Chef, Chopped - stuff like that. This feels like rambling but it\u2019s all important context I think. \n\nHere\u2019s where we get to if I am being an asshole or not. I do basically all the actual cooking in the house. If something is made from scratch it\u2019s made by me. What was once gratitude and appreciation from my wife has slowly become judgement and ridicule. Every time I cook I basically get a rundown of everything wrong with the dish. Something is under/over seasoned or under/over cooked. Sometimes she uses words like \u2018pedestrian\u2019 and I know she\u2019s just joking because we don\u2019t use words like those although they are common from cooking show judges. Well last week I made meatloaf and when she saw it, she looked disappointed and said \u2018it looks like dogshit my dear\u2019 which is again like a play on something you\u2019d hear Gordon Ramsay say but then she didn\u2019t eat it and so I think she was actually thinking it. I\u2019ll be honest it kind of hurt my feelings.\n\nThis last week I haven\u2019t cooked. We\u2019ve just been eating out or leftovers. Today I cooked but only a single portion for myself. My wife assumed I was cooking for her and she was upset when I had only enough to make a plate for myself. I didn\u2019t tell her I wasn\u2019t cooking for her so she basically sat down for dinner and had nothing so she had to go out to get food. We haven\u2019t really talked all night and I can tell she\u2019s annoyed with me. I\u2019m starting to feel guilty myself.

You are not taking anything away from her. She is an adult who can feed herself.\n\nIt is interesting that while insults have changed, she has been insulting from the beginning. So while you don't need to explain why you aren't cooking, she knows, there is a larger issue here.

Why didn\u2019t you call her on it rather than letting her discover that you were too angry to cook for her?", "ESH.\n\n\"You aren't Gordon Ramsey and this isn't Hell's Kitchen.\"\n\nYes, she should have picked up up that you don't like her pretending she's a judge on a cooking show, but you should have spoken up and said something.  In a lot of places, guys have a habit of making fun of each other as part of their comraderie so she may be thinking she's doing something similar with your cooking.  Yes, not every guy participates in the \"put down jokes\" culture but not every woman picks up on all the social cues of how their own jokes land, either.", "ESH. She's picked up on the Ramsay vibe and thinks it's funny to be rude. She could just say she doesn't like meat loaf. And if she is always having meals prepared for her from scratch, she should thank the chef every single time. Just  a quick \" that was delicious \" and a cleared plate is always appreciated. \n\nOP you could just tell her that her constant pejorative remarks are a bit wearing. She's not a TV cooking judge, so her remarks aren't coming from expertise, they are opinions. She's \nallowed her opinions but it sounds as if she's playing a role here. Tell her if she seriously dislikes a meal she should mention it but you find the  nitpicking irritating. Ask her if it would be possible to have a meal without going into Ramsay mode. He's doing a role too.", "ESH. She is for behaving like that, and you are for being so childish about it instead of actually\u2026 you know. Discussing it. I assume you are an adult; behave like one.", "ESH. You believe she's joking but her jokes aren't funny. Instead of telling her that she's hurting your feelings and trying to communicate,   you just start acting passive aggressive. You're both childish. You need to use your words and she needs to use less", "ESH. And throughout all of this, you've not thought to, I don't know, talk to her??? Instead you punish her like she is a child, except with no explanation.

I'm from a country where this is not seen as weird, by the way.\n\nOne of the reasons that makes cooking so rewarding is how happy my spouse gets whenever I make something good. They will also constructively tell me if something did not work out. \n\nHonestly, ESH, though mild. You are being really passive aggressive about this, instead of telling her how unmotivated and underappreciated she makes you feel. And your wife is being really entitled about the food you make, and unsupportive. But she may not even notice she is making you feel bad, to her it might even be playful.\n\nAnyways, the way for you to solve it just to talk about it, instead of vainly hoping she is going to have a road of Damascus moment that she has been making you feel like shit for months.", "ESH because this could have been as easy conversation. \u201cHey babe I think you\u2019re trying to joke around but it\u2019s really starting to annoy me/hurt my feelings that I\u2019m putting all this effort into our meals and you\u2019re treating it like a tv show.\u201d Then she can apologize and everyone can be happy. And if she doesn\u2019t apologize, instead doubling down and telling you she was just joking or you\u2019re being too sensitive (you know, classic stereotypical guy defenses) then you know she\u2019s the A H and you should never cook for her again.", "Light ESH, she\u2019s definitely the AH for being so rude and condescending towards your cooking, but I also think you went a little too far with your response to her insults and comments.

The comment your wife made was a jerk move. Like Gordon Ramsey funny haha, but then she didn't eat it so I would assume the same thing you did, that she really didn't like it. There are ways to say things like that as constructive criticism and not AHish. You might be the AH if you didn't tell her you weren't going to cook anymore and definitely the AH for cooking at dinner time and not enough for both without saying so beforehand.

Passive aggression isn't going to save your marriage. Tell her honestly how you feel.", "ESH", "ESH.\n\nHer, obviously, but you need to communicate and set your expectations. She needs to know where your boundaries are. Clearly telling her that if she insults your food, you're done, is your responsibility.\n\nMaybe get away from any of the competitive shows that prioritize zingers and degrading statements. There's a lot of shows that emphasize kindness, personal goals and personal growth. I watch MasterChef Australia, but I don't tolerate shows that are all drama and don't center the cooking. You know. Like all the Ramsey shows in the US.\n\nI just have to add, when I met my husband I was young and knew nothing about cooking. His unfailing support, even when I obviously screwed up, was a huge factor in me being comfortable cooking. It doesn't matter how long you've worked in a kitchen, or how well you know the recipe; everyone has bad days, bad decisions, or just gets distracted. Her expectation of *perfection* from you is going to kill your love of cooking if you don't make it crystal goddam clear that this is *unacceptable*.", "Esh,  your wife is ungrateful and you shouldnt solely cook from now on, you suck because you resorted to being a child and didnt communicate your feelings at all. Grow up and tell her what shes done to hurt you. Good lord man come on.", "ESH, what your wife said was horrible and I understand why your feelings are hurt. She messed up , but instead of confronting her and telling her that she hurt you, you\u2019re just being passive aggressive.", "I\u2019m thinking either E S H or N A H. Instead of sulking and not cooking for you wife, put your big boy pants on and have a conversation", "ESH. Yeah her attitude is AH. However If you are upset then use your words and tell her.\n\nSome people do have difficulties catching on on social cues. No matter of they are on the spectrum or simply slow in the uptake. And it won't solve anything to react in any way that is not clear communication.\n\nI mean being passive aggressive about it can be very satisfying, I get that. But in the long run it is probably better to establish clear communication between spouses instead of being frustated until things streighten themself out. Especially if one partner seems slow with social behavior.", "ESH your wifey was definitely an asshole for her behaviour, but by your story you didn't confront her about it until a week later by not cooking. That's an asshole behaviour. She should have had the opportunity to address the issue before being left with the consequences.", "ESH.
