Growing up I spent most Sundays with my mother and/or grandmother in the kitchen cooking a big meal for the whole family. \n\nWhen I met my wife we were young and she thought my love for cooking was a little weird for a guy, but she quickly grew to enjoy the benefits. At the time she would tease me for watching cooking shows but eventually they grew on her as well. Now if we are watching TV together, we are watching a cooking show. She especially likes the competitive ones, shows like Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Masterchef, Next Level Chef, Chopped - stuff like that. This feels like rambling but it\u2019s all important context I think. \n\nHere\u2019s where we get to if I am being an asshole or not. I do basically all the actual cooking in the house. If something is made from scratch it\u2019s made by me. What was once gratitude and appreciation from my wife has slowly become judgement and ridicule. Every time I cook I basically get a rundown of everything wrong with the dish. Something is under/over seasoned or under/over cooked. Sometimes she uses words like \u2018pedestrian\u2019 and I know she\u2019s just joking because we don\u2019t use words like those although they are common from cooking show judges. Well last week I made meatloaf and when she saw it, she looked disappointed and said \u2018it looks like dogshit my dear\u2019 which is again like a play on something you\u2019d hear Gordon Ramsay say but then she didn\u2019t eat it and so I think she was actually thinking it. I\u2019ll be honest it kind of hurt my feelings.\n\nThis last week I haven\u2019t cooked. We\u2019ve just been eating out or leftovers. Today I cooked but only a single portion for myself. My wife assumed I was cooking for her and she was upset when I had only enough to make a plate for myself. I didn\u2019t tell her I wasn\u2019t cooking for her so she basically sat down for dinner and had nothing so she had to go out to get food. We haven\u2019t really talked all night and I can tell she\u2019s annoyed with me. I\u2019m starting to feel guilty myself.

If she asks, I would simply say that lately cooking for her has become a miserable experience due to her lack of appreciation and ugly comments", "Appalling all the YTA and ESH. In what world is it OP's responsibility to not want to be insulted and ridiculed. His wife is obviously TA. And it's up to him if he wants to communicate how she is hurting him. But she is clearly TA.", "You are TA for taking such a childish approach instead of talking. I get it, and I\u2019m on your side, but the wrong approach for sure.", "NTA \n\nAt this point I would just be direct with her. I\u2019m shocked you\u2019ve put up with this as long as you have. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cooking show, I didn\u2019t ask you to judge me or belittle me, so why are you? When did you become so comfortable being cruel to me? Is this really what you imagined for our marriage, it\u2019s certainly not the dynamic I was picturing.\u201d", "ESH  \n\n\nYour wife is being disrespectful and insulting to you despite all of the work you put into your meals.    \n\n\nThat being said, did you communicate your feelings to her before you made the passive aggressive decision to cook only for yourself?  Healthy marriages involve communication.", "NTA but OP's wife should be so grateful that he cooks at all and spares her this tedious bit of work. She's an adult, she can figure out why her hb didn't cook for her. She's TA.", "NTA I think you should talk with your wife about how you feel, to at least clarify that she didn\u2019t mean it as anymore than a joke, but with the information provided, it seems pretty intentional.", "NTA. This is one of those things that doesn't need a discussion. She knows she is being a dick by insulting your food. She doesn't appreciate it, she doesn't get any. You don't owe her food. You are not taking anything away from her. She is an adult who can feed herself.\n\nIt is interesting that while insults have changed, she has been insulting from the beginning. So while you don't need to explain why you aren't cooking, she knows, there is a larger issue here. She moved from insulting you for cooking to insulting the quality of what you cook when cooking is part of your core. \n\nIs she overly critical about other things? Because you may be married to a bad partner who likes to make you feel bad. How sad for her.", "NTA she was incredibly rude and she shouldn't be surprised that you no longer want to cook for her. She shouldn't bite the hand that literally feeds her.", "ESH.  You created a monster.   She\u2019s being very rude, but y\u2019all need to use your words\u2026", "NTA", "Cook for her because you want to and enjoy it. If that\u2019s not the case anymore, don\u2019t do it. You should do what brings you joy", "Divorce her, she wants to criticize you for fun, she isn\u2019t worth your time or effort, you should not feel guilty for your approach, she wants to criticize your cooking, she can find a way to feed herself", "INFO: Have you communicated with your wife about how it hurts your feelings?", "NTA. Keep her away from watching cooking shows.", "NTA but you're definitely moving in AH direction by not talking to her and telling her how you feel / trying to work out what the issues are. She's not a mind reader.", "Use words. Talk to her. Communicate how you feel.", "I don\u2019t blame you for your anger at her comments on the food you prepare. It\u2019s rude. But you should have spoken to her about it instead of passively/aggressively not making any food for her without giving her prior notice.", "ESH. \n\nYour wife for thinking that making fun of the food you make is an appropriate thing to do, and you for not just asking her to stop doing it.", "Esh, I think you guys should have a conversation like adults about how your feelings are hurt by her behavior. \ud83d\ude05", "Why do people marry people they can't talk to? ESH", "ESH. The core problem you and your wife have is a lack of communication. You both need to sit down and have an adult conversation, and not while you're eating, watching TV, or distracted by anything at all, especially your phones. Leave both phones in a different room if you need to so you can focus on the issues at hand. Come to a meaningful agreement regarding all aspects of your relationship, not just cooking or chores.", "ESH. Your wife, for being rude and unappreciative, and you for acting like a child instead of talking to her and telling her how her cruel words make you feel.", "NTA for not cooking when you're not being appreciated, but for the love of all that's holy, TALK to your wife. \n\nSit down with her and explain why you're not cooking for her. If she says something like \"I was just joking\", tell her you don't find it funny, and it needs to stop. You don't expect lavish praise, but she needs to stop insulting your efforts. At that point, if the insults or some other form of \"jokes\" continue, you can tell her you won't be cooking for her anymore. She'll know why, and as my mother says, she can get happy in those same pants she got pissy in.\n\nThe point is...COMMUNICATE.", "I don\u2019t know why people get married without basic communication skills. Have you\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 tried talking to her about it????", "Info: have you talked to her about this? About how it makes you feel when she constantly criticizes you? \nA true and honest conversation where you actually say it like it is and out loud?", "Soft YTA.\n\nLiterally, all you had to do was use your words: \"your comment that the meatloaf looked like dog shit was hurtful. I spend time cooking for us and your comments have become more and more negative. It lacks appreciation for my time and labor and take away my enjoyment of cooking.\" \n\nWhat you did was a passive aggressive thing that doesn't actually address what is going on. So, yea, she may not get how bothered you are.", "YTA. That was the wrong way to communicate your feelings. Don\u2019t even deny a woman food. Be like everyone else who does most of the cooking Ina household and say \u201cyou know if you don\u2019t like my cooking\u2026you can start cooking more\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "YTA man you really didn't need to respond like that. Extremely immature, honestly. You could have sat her down and told her how her words and actions affect you and have communicated like an adult instead of throwing a small tantrum. You owe her an apology, but she owes you one as well.", "YTA\n\nThis is one of those times where you have an adult conversation and tell her your feelings to fix the problem together.\n\n\"I apologize for not cooking for you, that was immature on my part. I have a hard time telling you my feelings.\nI feel ______ when you criticize and joke about my cooking because _______. I don't feel appreciated or ______. \"", "NTA in general for being upset, but kinda the AH for being a passive aggressive child instead of communicating as an adult and partner.", "YTA. Your wife is also rude and maybe needs to be checked a bit in regards to her attitude. My husband is also the cook in my family and I eat everything he makes me and I'm damn grateful for it. But YOU should also communicate with her like an adult rather than sitting down to dinner having made nothing for her when you've never done that before or voiced how you were feeling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The wife is not a young child who needs this explained to her. She is being deliberately hurtful and somehow people here believe OP is wrong for not, \"communicating\" before deciding not to cook for her.

I would think his wife's silence is a testament to her guilt. She knows she did something wrong. So why isn't she reaching out to him to figure it out? OP doesn't owe her anything. It's up to her to fess up and apologize.", "I agree 100%. It's one thing to make a bad joke, but it's another to say something that disrespectful *and then* not eat the dish!
