Growing up I spent most Sundays with my mother and/or grandmother in the kitchen cooking a big meal for the whole family. \n\nWhen I met my wife we were young and she thought my love for cooking was a little weird for a guy, but she quickly grew to enjoy the benefits. At the time she would tease me for watching cooking shows but eventually they grew on her as well. Now if we are watching TV together, we are watching a cooking show. She especially likes the competitive ones, shows like Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Masterchef, Next Level Chef, Chopped - stuff like that. This feels like rambling but it\u2019s all important context I think. \n\nHere\u2019s where we get to if I am being an asshole or not. I do basically all the actual cooking in the house. If something is made from scratch it\u2019s made by me. What was once gratitude and appreciation from my wife has slowly become judgement and ridicule. Every time I cook I basically get a rundown of everything wrong with the dish. Something is under/over seasoned or under/over cooked. Sometimes she uses words like \u2018pedestrian\u2019 and I know she\u2019s just joking because we don\u2019t use words like those although they are common from cooking show judges. Well last week I made meatloaf and when she saw it, she looked disappointed and said \u2018it looks like dogshit my dear\u2019 which is again like a play on something you\u2019d hear Gordon Ramsay say but then she didn\u2019t eat it and so I think she was actually thinking it. I\u2019ll be honest it kind of hurt my feelings.\n\nThis last week I haven\u2019t cooked. We\u2019ve just been eating out or leftovers. Today I cooked but only a single portion for myself. My wife assumed I was cooking for her and she was upset when I had only enough to make a plate for myself. I didn\u2019t tell her I wasn\u2019t cooking for her so she basically sat down for dinner and had nothing so she had to go out to get food. We haven\u2019t really talked all night and I can tell she\u2019s annoyed with me. I\u2019m starting to feel guilty myself.

In a lot of places, guys have a habit of making fun of each other as part of their comraderie so she may be thinking she's doing something similar with your cooking.  Yes, not every guy participates in the \"put down jokes\" culture but not every woman picks up on all the social cues of how their own jokes land, either.", "ESH. She's picked up on the Ramsay vibe and thinks it's funny to be rude. She could just say she doesn't like meat loaf. And if she is always having meals prepared for her from scratch, she should thank the chef every single time. Just  a quick \" that was delicious \" and a cleared plate is always appreciated. \n\nOP you could just tell her that her constant pejorative remarks are a bit wearing. She's not a TV cooking judge, so her remarks aren't coming from expertise, they are opinions. She's \nallowed her opinions but it sounds as if she's playing a role here. Tell her if she seriously dislikes a meal she should mention it but you find the  nitpicking irritating. Ask her if it would be possible to have a meal without going into Ramsay mode. He's doing a role too.", "ESH. She is for behaving like that, and you are for being so childish about it instead of actually\u2026 you know. Discussing it. I assume you are an adult; behave like one.", "ESH. You believe she's joking but her jokes aren't funny. Instead of telling her that she's hurting your feelings and trying to communicate,   you just start acting passive aggressive. You're both childish.

They will also constructively tell me if something did not work out. \n\nHonestly, ESH, though mild. You are being really passive aggressive about this, instead of telling her how unmotivated and underappreciated she makes you feel. And your wife is being really entitled about the food you make, and unsupportive. But she may not even notice she is making you feel bad, to her it might even be playful.\n\nAnyways, the way for you to solve it just to talk about it, instead of vainly hoping she is going to have a road of Damascus moment that she has been making you feel like shit for months.", "ESH because this could have been as easy conversation. \u201cHey babe I think you\u2019re trying to joke around but it\u2019s really starting to annoy me/hurt my feelings that I\u2019m putting all this effort into our meals and you\u2019re treating it like a tv show.\u201d Then she can apologize and everyone can be happy. And if she doesn\u2019t apologize, instead doubling down and telling you she was just joking or you\u2019re being too sensitive (you know, classic stereotypical guy defenses) then you know she\u2019s the A H and you should never cook for her again.", "Light ESH, she\u2019s definitely the AH for being so rude and condescending towards your cooking, but I also think you went a little too far with your response to her insults and comments.

The comment your wife made was a jerk move. Like Gordon Ramsey funny haha, but then she didn't eat it so I would assume the same thing you did, that she really didn't like it. There are ways to say things like that as constructive criticism and not AHish.

Passive aggression isn't going to save your marriage. Tell her honestly how you feel.", "ESH", "ESH.\n\nHer, obviously, but you need to communicate and set your expectations. She needs to know where your boundaries are. Clearly telling her that if she insults your food, you're done, is your responsibility.\n\nMaybe get away from any of the competitive shows that prioritize zingers and degrading statements. There's a lot of shows that emphasize kindness, personal goals and personal growth. I watch MasterChef Australia, but I don't tolerate shows that are all drama and don't center the cooking. You know. Like all the Ramsey shows in the US.\n\nI just have to add, when I met my husband I was young and knew nothing about cooking. His unfailing support, even when I obviously screwed up, was a huge factor in me being comfortable cooking. It doesn't matter how long you've worked in a kitchen, or how well you know the recipe; everyone has bad days, bad decisions, or just gets distracted. Her expectation of *perfection* from you is going to kill your love of cooking if you don't make it crystal goddam clear that this is *unacceptable*.", "Esh,  your wife is ungrateful and you shouldnt solely cook from now on, you suck because you resorted to being a child and didnt communicate your feelings at all. Grow up and tell her what shes done to hurt you. Good lord man come on.", "ESH, what your wife said was horrible and I understand why your feelings are hurt. She messed up , but instead of confronting her and telling her that she hurt you, you\u2019re just being passive aggressive.", "I\u2019m thinking either E S H or N A H. Instead of sulking and not cooking for you wife, put your big boy pants on and have a conversation", "ESH. Yeah her attitude is AH. However If you are upset then use your words and tell her.\n\nSome people do have difficulties catching on on social cues. No matter of they are on the spectrum or simply slow in the uptake. And it won't solve anything to react in any way that is not clear communication.\n\nI mean being passive aggressive about it can be very satisfying, I get that. But in the long run it is probably better to establish clear communication between spouses instead of being frustated until things streighten themself out. Especially if one partner seems slow with social behavior.", "ESH your wifey was definitely an asshole for her behaviour, but by your story you didn't confront her about it until a week later by not cooking. That's an asshole behaviour. She should have had the opportunity to address the issue before being left with the consequences.", "ESH.

This probably wasn\u2019t funny at the time and makes my dad an AH, but it was ~40 years ago so it makes me laugh now.)\n\nMy partner and I watch plenty of cooking shows together. We think Gordon Ramsay\u2019s criticisms and commentary are amazing and hilarious. That said, I do most of the cooking in our household and if my partner started making negative, Ramsay-esque comments about my cooking, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be making food for him any longer. I actually would probably stop cooking altogether if I knew he was going to be home for the meal because I wouldn\u2019t want to think about what he might say to me. So good on you, OP, for continuing to be passionate about cooking and not taking her criticism too much to heart.", "ESH. Maybe have a conversation about this instead of passive aggressive middle school BS?", "You probably should have told her at the time she wouldn't eat the meatloaf. The lack of communication is not excusable. However, neither is her childish behavior. Both TAH.", "NTA. I will take the stance that you should talk to her about it. On the other hand, there's no way she isn't self aware enough to know why you aren't cooking for her or she would have said something about it. Sounds like she's not saying anything either in hopes that your pettiness runs out of steam and you just go back to cooking for her.", "Going to say yta because you point out that its not wording either of you would use normally, and that you know she means it as a joke, but instead of saying anything to her like how it upsets you when she says this, you just don't make food for her. \n\nSpeak up man. If something upsets you say so. If she then keeps doing it then yes just make food for yourself.", "ESH because you two aren\u2019t communicating.

Maybe a tiny bit petty in the manner of execution, but explain to her verbally and calmly that if she keeps saying your food is shit like an over dramatized tv show you will be less inclined to cook for her.", "NTA for how you feel....YTA for how you handled the situation.... You should have spoken to your wife and told her that you're not a cooking show contestant and if she can't appreciate what you make for dinner, she should eat elsewhere or cook her own....  Just going passive aggressive and unliterally deciding to \"ghost her in the kitchen\" is childish.", "NTA. Her meanness to you shows her true character. Better to realize this BEFORE you have children.", "I'm going to say NTA, but it's very close to an ESH situation. Everything she did was wrong. It's one thing to offer constructive criticism if it's asked for or to inform you if something is wrong (like accidentally using salt instead of sugar). But insults are messed up, especially when you're the only one doing the cooking.\n\nWhere it comes close for you is the passive aggressive response. You need to have open and honest communication. She might genuinely think she's being funny in a way you'll get because of the shared activity of watching cooking competition shows. But if it hurts, you MUST tell her so she's aware.", "NTA She ridicules your cooking and then expects you to cook for her?  Uh no.", "YTA - I was fully with you until you were petty and cooked for yourself and not her instead of communicating your feelings like a grown ass adult - you behaved like a petty child.

It's degrading, especially when you're essentially doing her a serious kindness by making sure y'all have healthy home cooked meals to have.   \nI think you need to sit her down and seriously tell her how it's making you feel, start the communication ball rolling. Hell, maybe even make something together while you're doing it so it feels less like a gross argument or talk and more like just a conversation between partners.", "ESH. You were childish for the way you handled it, but tell her that her \u201ccritiques\u201c make you feel unappreciated and you won\u2019t feel like cooking for her unless and until that stops", "Info: have you told her why you\u2019re not cooking for her or are you expecting her to read your mind? \n\nEven in your post, you seem to know she didn\u2019t meant it with malice. It was a joke that hurt your feelings, that happens sometimes, especially in lifelong relationships. You\u2019re allowed to be upset. But you\u2019re not allowed to just pout without telling her what\u2019s wrong and then call her the bad guy for it.", "NTA. Your wife is a sexist asshole. She knows exactly why you stopped cooking for her. If she wasn\u2019t aware  she was rude. she would be demanding an explanation. \n\nAnother thing to note. If your cooking is so bad why isn\u2019t she cooking?

Unfortunately, in the real world we have to communicate our feelings and can't expect others to be mind readers. Being passive aggressive doesn't solve anything.\nFor example, my partner and I often banter rough in that kind of way. It happened that one of us took it way too far and offended the other. Each time, we were quite open and direct about the hurt caused, allowing the other person to apologize and correct their behavior. It's really that simple.", "Because this is the real world and you communicate with your partner, you dont retaliate.\n\nTheir marriage is doomed and so is the marriage of anyone that thinks this is the right move.\n\nDoes it help OP to absolve him? No. Not at all. They're both fucking up their relationship.", "Only on AITA could someone look at this situation where a woman is calling her husband's cooking dogshit to his face and actually judge *him* to be the asshole.  It seems like she entered into this relationship with very toxic ideas about cooking in general (thought it was \"weird\" that a guy would be into it) and now it's just manifesting in a different way.  \n\nIf she harbors outdated opinions on gender roles and cooking, they maybe she should take it upon herself to try cooking for the two of them instead.", "How is this the top comment?
