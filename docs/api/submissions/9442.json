They accepted.\u00a0 They were able to get the time off work and had made arrangements for the kids for the trip.\n\nMy ex found out about it she flipped out and was calling me and texting me about how much of an AH I am for doing that to her.

It's your vacation, which you gave away to your best friend and her sister, who did tell the truth.", "NTA, NTA, NTA! Wow! You definitely dodged a bullet. Your ex sounds like a twisted piece of work. I personally despise cheaters. I am wondering if someone in your position who is now out of thousands of dollars, can rightfully sue your ex for 50% of what this wedding cost you. Maybe you should consult a lawyer. I say that you are entitled to do whatever you want with that vacation. Your ex had her chance. Oh, and also, I don\u2019t see how her new bf has any say at all!

Inform her family and friends who are hassling you as to the reasons why you broke up with her, the full unvarnished truth, and ask them not to contact you again.  She and her sister are probably going to have a rift anyway because she gave her an ultimatum to expose her cheating, but at least they will have a great holiday.
