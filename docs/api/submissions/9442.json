I served 6 years before getting medically discharged.\u00a0 EX and i started dating. I got a good job that would have me leave a couple times a month up to 10 days at a time.\n\nWhile doing some last minute wedding planning a text from her sister\u00a0 poped up asking \"have you told [my name] about what you did with [her ex-boyfriend]. If you don't do it tonight I will tomorrow.\" I asked her what was that? She tried to play it off.\n\nI keept pressing her and said that during ther Bachelorette party she ran in to him but nothing happened. It was an obvious lie.\n\nI went through her phone when she fell asleep. There was text and pictures with him all the way back from when we started dating. They would hook up every time I went on work trips. Sent proof to my phone.\n\nI woke her up kicked her out and ended the relationship. She did the cheaters script. I told her \"Stephanie\" looked a lot like her ex bf and showed her one of the screen shots of them together in my bed. She started to cry and I gently got her our the door.\n\nI canceled all wedding plans and needed some help calling guest to inform them the wedding was off.\n\nMy friends wife said that during the Bachelorette party she caught them sneaking away and having intimate time. When she confronted them she gave my ex the option of coming clean to me herself or she would do it. She did not know it was an ongoing thing.\n\nNow on to the honeymoon vacation.\u00a0 I had planned it so that it would be perfect for my ex. It was 10 day trip to another country that she has always said was a \"once in a lifetime bucket list place.\" There was nice hotels amazing experiences and over all her dream vacation.\u00a0 I was already out about 10 grand for the wedding and more if I canceled the honeymoon trip.\n\nI made the decision to offer it up to them. Since I knew that they never had a honeymoon or really any real vacations since they got married young and had kids. Also they just saved me money and time. They accepted.\u00a0 They were able to get the time off work and had made arrangements for the kids for the trip.\n\nMy ex found out about it she flipped out and was calling me and texting me about how much of an AH I am for doing that to her. How I knew that it was HER dream vacation. How i ruined her life. I got messages from her friends and some of her family that she lied to and blaming me for the breakup. Her ex even texted me saying that im not a real man and then threatened me. She must have went there las night as he shouldn't have my number.I have not responded to them at all.\n\nBut AITA for giving my cheating ex fianc\u00e9e dream honeymoon to her sister and my best friend?", "created_utc": 1675860651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wvw6u/aita_for_giving_the_vacation_of_my_26m_ex_fiance/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You paid for it, you couldn\u2019t use it, you get to decide what to do with it, and gifting it to a long-term friend is a perfectly acceptable thing to do.

Start a group chat with all those numbers and send the screenshots of the messages you found and any pics that are pg. Don't get in trouble sending anything that includes body bits and pieces.

(after you send proof and explanation to all her friends and family, cause frankly she needs the shame; and you need your reputation restored)\n\nIf you have unfinished business like possessions etc. I'm sure your friends can act as buffer so you don't have to interact with that pair again. \n\nYou've done a great thing for the sister, proving you were the opposite of petty.

It's your vacation, which you gave away to your best friend and her sister, who did tell the truth.", "NTA, NTA, NTA! Wow! You definitely dodged a bullet. Your ex sounds like a twisted piece of work. I personally despise cheaters. I am wondering if someone in your position who is now out of thousands of dollars, can rightfully sue your ex for 50% of what this wedding cost you. Maybe you should consult a lawyer. I say that you are entitled to do whatever you want with that vacation. Your ex had her chance. Oh, and also, I don\u2019t see how her new bf has any say at all! I\u2019m sure she will cheat on him too in time. People like this don\u2019t change.", "NTA talk to the police about the threat.

I am so happy to know that you actually turned this into a happy moment for someone and I definitely hope that you will be fine after this episode, as it can be quite harsh, emotionally speaking. This was a really bad episode that you had to go through, only to see who is actually there with you in life and to avoid having a marriage based on lies and cheating.", "Not the pictures though, that's revenge p*rn and not ok and illegal in certain areas ( as it should be). \n\nScreenshots of convos are fair game though!"]}
