They accepted.\u00a0 They were able to get the time off work and had made arrangements for the kids for the trip.\n\nMy ex found out about it she flipped out and was calling me and texting me about how much of an AH I am for doing that to her.

It's your vacation, which you gave away to your best friend and her sister, who did tell the truth.", "NTA, NTA, NTA! Wow! You definitely dodged a bullet. Your ex sounds like a twisted piece of work. I personally despise cheaters. I am wondering if someone in your position who is now out of thousands of dollars, can rightfully sue your ex for 50% of what this wedding cost you. Maybe you should consult a lawyer. I say that you are entitled to do whatever you want with that vacation. Your ex had her chance. Oh, and also, I don\u2019t see how her new bf has any say at all!

I am so happy to know that you actually turned this into a happy moment for someone and I definitely hope that you will be fine after this episode, as it can be quite harsh, emotionally speaking.

Also, get yourself tested for stds, just to be safe.\n\nI'd say the trip is a lovely thank you to the sister because you never would have known what was going on without her.

You paid for the trip so you get to decide what happens with it - either you go by yourself or find a friend to go with you, or you gift it to someone deserving. You chose someone deserving.

You freaking won this fight. She didn't think of you when cheating on you, why should you give her opinion any thought when planning a vacation.
