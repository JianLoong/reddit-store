Tonight, I was in the kitchen when he came home, opened the fridge and said shux, I ate the same thing for three days now.  I can't remember exactly how the conversation went but I basically said \"are you complaining about it?\" and \"why are you telling me?\"  I don't think I yelled it or said it rudely but my dad seemed really ticked off/surprised at my reaction and kind of dropped his jaw and said wow, [my name] you sound like [indirect version of your mother], what happened to you, you whipping me up, I can't believe how things are changing around here\" etc.  I said no, I'm just saying, are you complaining about it?
