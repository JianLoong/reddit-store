You didn't pay all that money to sit in a hotel room while she sleeps. I would say go out, see some stuff, and then come back to the hotel to get her around the time she wakes up.

I am a chronically ill person who spent 3 weeks in Italy with my husband awhile back.  I had to nap every day in order to have energy for all the other activities.  He would often explore while I napped and I was fine with that- we were both doing what we wanted and needed.  I limited my naps to a couple hours (I could easily sleep longer but wanted just enough rest to fuel me for rest of day).  He didn't go do things we planned on doing together.  Have your GF prioritize what she wants to see.  While she is resting you should be able to see things that are not top of her list.  She should also commit to meeting you at the prioritized activities at a certain time.  Also, she should maybe go to bed earlier depending on whether daytime or nighttime activities have priority.", "> because places in NYC close in late afternoon\n\nI lived in NYC for almost a decade, and this just isn't true? Which places are you referring to specifically?", "NTA, but ask her what sights/activities she does not want to do but that you would like to do, and do them while she sleeps. So she doesn't feel like she is missing out. Her wanting to rest and share experiences during a holiday is fine, but having you just sit there while she does is just selfish. \n\nAlso...if your travel preferences don't really match, then maybe take a look at if this might be true for other aspects of how you want your life to be. Especially if she is that unwilling to compromise.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is being inconsiderate and selfish. You can return to her when she wakes up.\n\nPersonally, I am tired of waiting for people to do something I want to do. This will cause resentment.", "NAH - This is possibly a once in a lifetime vacation for you but for her it may be a break from a brutal and exhausting uni schedule. Her idea of a vacation is sleeping in and relaxing and your idea of a vacation is maximizing tourist opportunities. Enjoy yourself and text her to contact you when she gets up and you can either go back to her or make plans to meet up somewhere.", "NTA. It took way too long for my husband and I to realize we vacation differently\u2026.and that\u2019s ok.  He wants to do it all. I want to relax, sleep in and people watch. So, we go places where we can do both. Interestingly, my son hangs out with me. Laid back.  My daughter goes with my husband, wants to do it all. So, it works out. \n\nWe do most things together. But, there is typically a day or two that my son and I just hang out while my daughter and husband go out and about. It works very well for us.", "This is bullshit, go out. If she wants to fight, tell her she can wait like you\u2019ve been waiting on your $5,000 vacation. You will absolutely resent her if you let her keep forcing you. I don\u2019t actually care when the museum closes. I honestly don\u2019t think it matters that she has insomnia or some other sleep disorder. It is bonkers to be trapped for 10+ hours in a room awake on vacation because she wants you not to have fun while she sleeps. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s ill. I have sick friends who travel in our group and they always tell everyone to go on ahead and then they meet us later. We double back on things that are important to them or we save them for a time when that person is mobile. I will reiterate that even if museums were open until 4 a.m. it is enormously unfair to force you to follow her sleep schedule. It would be akin to you forcing her to explore while exhausted (which you have kindly not done). You are NTA.", "NtA you just want to visit the city and to enjoy the trip you spent so much money on", "NTA. Leave that wet towel behind if all she wants to do is sleep, and go enjoy yourself in NYC. She is definitely not playing fairly.", "NTA\n\nthat's alot of money to spend and if she isn't able to make it that doesn't mean you shouldn't get to enjoy yourself too. I do think you should wake her up and tell her before  you leave though because waking up to someone just being gone is scary. Next time she is up explain that you understand she can't/won't go out earlier but you're gonna spend time on your own so that you get to enjoy the trip.", "NTA.

It could be a once in a lifetime opportunity and it\u2019s wrong for her to want it just squandered away.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to go out then go.  You're grown and if she wants to sleep then let her.  Don't ruin your trip bc of her.", "Some people aren\u2019t compatible in their vacation preferences. I know a lot of people who love seeing all the sites and going out, trying food, the whole deal and some who want a more relaxing vacation with sleeping in going out for a bit in the afternoon and having a night in at the hotel. They\u2019re just very different preference. I think the issue is when either side doesn\u2019t let the other have the experience they want on vacation. It\u2019s ver kid of you to let her sleep in as that\u2019s not the dream\nVacation you imagined but she shouldn\u2019t be holding you back from doing the things you want because it\u2019s not what she imagined.

You should absolutely go out by yourself and do what you want to do. I mean if she\u2019s just sleeping in, I don\u2019t get what she wants you to do, just stay there and watch her sleep? If she wanted a super chill do nothing type vacation, then it would\u2019ve been better to go to a beachside resort or something rather than NYC. \n\nI think your compromise is perfectly reasonable. She can sleep in and get her rest, and join up with you once she\u2019s ready to go out.", "I don't think you'd be TA for asking her to meet up with you somewhere when she wakes up. It's a fine compromise.\n\nBut I can't help but wonder why you you're under the impression there's nothing to do in NYC after the late afternoon? There's always something to do no matter what time it is. It's one of the largest cities in the world. Maybe do what you want to do while she sleeps and then see what she wants to do in the evening.", "Nta. Just go out and do what you want. If she gets mad she gets mad.

So you just need to do some planning - let her plan the things she is most looking forward to doing and schedule those in for when she is available, then when you have free time that she isn't available you can fill it with some of the things she isn't bothered about and would otherwise be missed out.\n\nThere will always be so e measure of compromise - in the same way you don't want to be sitting waiting for her, she also doesn't want to be sitting for hours waiting for you to finish what you are doing, taking a break or whatever before you can do something together.
