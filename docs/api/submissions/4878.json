I limited my naps to a couple hours (I could easily sleep longer but wanted just enough rest to fuel me for rest of day).  He didn't go do things we planned on doing together.  Have your GF prioritize what she wants to see.  While she is resting you should be able to see things that are not top of her list.

I have sick friends who travel in our group and they always tell everyone to go on ahead and then they meet us later. We double back on things that are important to them or we save them for a time when that person is mobile.

And OP is right about the hours of museums and tourist attractions.\n\nI guess I could see not knowing this if someone hasn't lived here since COVID and/or didn't take in much museum type stuff when they did live here.", "If a venue like a museum closes at 5, they'd need to get there at 2 or 3 to have time to see it and spend time there. To get there at 2 they'd need to leave at 1. To leave at 1 and have time to wake up, eat, get dressed and ready, especially for someone who might need to move more slowly, might mean waking up at 10 or 11.

She is sleeping, so it\u2019s not as if you are spending quality time with her. Has she said why she wants you to stay in (e.g., is she anxious about being on her own)? If it\u2019s safety, depending on where you are staying, I think you can reassure her that she is fine as NYC is generally a safe city.
