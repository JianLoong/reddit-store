That sounds too serious, I know, but there's a lot of money involved here.", "NTA. Your son is taking advantage of the trust you put in him. It was your money and he\u2019d be lucky if he got any of it. I will say you did the wrong thing by giving him that money and not having a written agreement as to what happened with it. Because this could be taken to court now. You should do something about this fast or I guess you could be a push over and let him take it but that\u2019s destroying boundaries I would hope you have with your kid. Your kid is no longer a kid. He shouldn\u2019t be stealing his mommy\u2019s money. That\u2019s ridiculous and entitled", "INFO: did you make it clear the money wasnt a gift, but just there for storing and safekeeping?", "You should have had a Contract with him that the initial 25k was your money. You might legally need to prove its yours now to claim rights over the additial 25k.\n\nIt certainly isn't his but you might have a hard time proving it now if it's in his name. Although sounds like you have enough where you could reach a compromise with hi.  But he shouldn't be bullying you into it.\n\nNTA"]}
