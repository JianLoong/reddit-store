Just lock the fucking door, dude. Putting notes up as a reminder sounds like a good idea, if it gives your wife peace of mind and it ensures you lock the door.", "YTA. My wife also has terrible anxiety about the door being locked, so much so that she physically touches the lock at night to be sure. I grew up in the country where we never locked the doors. It didn't even take me a month to get used to locking the door. Why does it matter if your wife feels safer with the door locked? It takes less than a second for you to lock the thing, just do it.", "I'm gonna say yta. I don't really care how safe your community is, if the person you live with needs locked doors you lock the doors. You figure out a way to ALWAYS lock the door. Especially at 4am.\n\nEdit add that to the fact that this behaviour was even worse in an unsafe neighborhood... \n\nI also have to wonder. Do you lock the door behind you when you go out with the dog? Or is she in there alone with the door unlocked until you get home", "Yta- in my relationship we have a rule, if one person cares and the other doesn\u2019t, just do it.  I\u2019m from a safe rural place.  He is not.  He always wants the door locked, so I make damn sure to do it so he feels safe.  Granted, where we live it\u2019s a good idea, but regardless of how that changes, I\u2019m just locking the door.  Let the woman sleep.", "could you get a smart lock that you can control with your phone? It might be pricey but it  sounds like you would be making a worthwhile investment.\n\nEditing to change to YTA: knock it off with trying to explain to your wife how \u201csafe\u201d the neighborhood is. It doesn\u2019t matter what you consider safe. She doesn\u2019t feel safe, and how she feels in her body is the thing that matters. To imply she shouldn\u2019t feel safe gets a little gaslighty.", "YTA \n\nBad things still happen in safe, gated neighborhoods and, bottom line, it\u2019s super important to your wife. It doesn\u2019t take much effort to make sure you lock the freaking door\u2026she\u2019s not being unreasonable with that very basic request. \n\nYou going on about her being \u2018hyper suspicious\u2019 and anxiety driven with her request is borderline gaslighting. Stop being an AH by trying to make her seem overly emotional or unreasonable and just lock the door.", "Soft YTA I'm going to be honest bad things can happen in safe areas. When I was growing up, my parents forgot to lock the front door one night and I ended up being attacked in my bed by an intruder. That was the only time they forgot and we lived in a very safe, upper middle class, suburban area. It took 10 years for the guy to be caught and I now religiously check the locks. So I totally get where your wife is coming from.\n\n\n I'd suggest putting bells on the doors that way if you forget to lock the door you will hear if someone is entering the house.", "YTA.\n\nYou need to develop the habit of locking doors. Make it habitual, and you won't forget.\n\nIf what it takes is a post-it at eye height on the door, saying \"lock me\", or a front door key clipped on to your puppy's leash, so whenever you grab the leash you automatically have the door key in your hand, then do that.", "YTA, just lock the door. Is taking the step to be a little more mindful that big of a hassle? You\u2019re causing your wife added anxiety & now nightmares because you don\u2019t find it necessary, when it takes all of 1 second to turn the lock. \n\nWhen I was 21 I had been living in my own with my son for a few years, one of my friends had a 3 bedroom her grandma owned & asked me to move in after her roommate moved out because she didn\u2019t feel safe living alone & it would be cheaper for us. I worked an office job and she was a waitress, so our schedule were different. I went to bed around 9 made sure to lock up all the doors like I usually do, and when she came home I guess she went outside to smoke & couldn\u2019t get the back door locked and just left it unlocked because it was 2am and she was exhausted. When I went to leave in the morning around 5:30 both the front & back doors were wide open, all the electronics & valuables including the tv were gone. Her boyfriends truck was even stolen. All in the matter of 3 hours. \n\nI have never felt safe after that. I moved out shortly after & now have to touch the lock everytime I go to bed to make sure it\u2019s actually locked. No matter how safe am environment may be, if taking the extra step puts her mind at ease it should be a priority to you. She\u2019s not asking for anything crazy, but continuously ignoring her request will drive her crazy.", "YTA. Not for occasionally forgetting but for not taking it seriously. People deserve to feel safe in their homes and it's something worth putting effort into. Figure out a way to help you remember, forgetting is only an excuse a couple of times and after that it's just a lack of effort. \n\nWhen I was a kid we lived in a rural area and didn't lock our doors during the day but every night my dad did a nightly sweep of the house to make sure everything was locked up and it gave me a sense of security, my husband does the same thing now. I think that would be a nice thing to do for your wife to help with her anxiety.", "My husband and I used to rent his mother\u2019s basement apartment. It was a very safe neighborhood in a very safe city. There was absolutely no reported crime in the neighborhood at all, hadn\u2019t been for years. Then in a single week there was a string of robberies not just in the neighborhood. On the same block.\n\nIt\u2019s safe until it isn\u2019t. \n\nMake it a habit, lock the door. Turn it into a ritual. Come in, turn around, push door closed and lock it in a single motion. Put keys on peg or in dish. Take shoes off. Look at the door again to be sure it\u2019s locked. Carry on. \n\nI had to teach my husband this. It\u2019s both terrifying and infuriating to be married to someone who doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit if I\u2019m safe in my own home. You don\u2019t see it that way. I do. So does your wife. So does your insurance company. Hell, maybe even the law sees it that way depending on where you live. \n\nYou\u2019re risking your wife\u2019s safety 10-20% of the time. That\u2019s simply not okay.

Op, you are being watched. It would scare the bejeesus out of you if you realized how much people are aware of your routines.

Have you even checked up on the registered sex offenders in your gated community?", "YTA\n\nAnd you're increasing your wife's anxiety and responses by not locking the doors the 2 out of 10 times. I'm not sure what kind of world you think we live in but just because you think a place is safe, doesn't mean things can't and won't happen. And you used to do it in what you considered an 'unsafe' neighborhood too. What was your justification then? Lock your damn doors every time!", "YTA, lock the door.

Men can just never understand this.\n\nDo you not value your wife and her safety?\n\nI bet you lock your car.", "Softest YTA bordering on NAH. \n\nFor example I am similar to your wife. My ex would do things like when I was out of town would take pictures of our door being unlocked and send them to me at night to taunt me. Now THAT would be AH behavior in this situation. But making a concerted effort to lock the doors and being mindful of her anxiety is really all she can expect. If she needs to take other measures that\u2019s fine!", "My husband was the same.  Doors had to be locked during the day and a keyed lock on our bedroom.  After we had been married a few years I realized he had been abused by his siblings.  That fear never goes away.  He went to counseling and learned when and how to stand up for himself but the locks were just a cushion for his emotions.  It's the type of thing you do when you love someone!", "Yes. YTA. \n\n\nIf you are so forgetful - then copy my 90 year old grandparents and have a reminder by the door to remind you. \n\n\nIt's not an irrational fear.

These need a key to open from outside, but not from the inside, and lock automatically when you shut the door.\n\n(Many people have this AND a mortice type lock that needs a key fro either side, and when they \"lock up\" for the night, they lock this second lock)\n\nIf you already HAVE a latch type lock, N T A", "I\u2019m torn. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for forgetting, but I do think it\u2019s an asshole move to need to have the huge emotional response make sense to you before you accept it. Explaining to her how safe the neighborhood is is the opposite of accepting it", "NAH - just.\n\nHuman Error is a Thing, humans are not perfect, and some are better at remembering things than others. So it's fair you don't remember every time.\n\nBut locking doors is (at least where I live) very much the normal thing, and your wife is natural to be worried if doors are unlocked. All the more so since women tend to be more vulnerable than men and tend therefore to be more concerned about unlocked doors (though that's a generalisation of course).\n\nThere's a line somewhere though between ok and not ok, which is somewhat subjective:\n\nOne extreme: remembering every time to lock the door except once a year - ok - human error.\n\nAnother extreme: remembering one time a month and forgetting every other time - not ok - failure either of process or effort.\n\nYour situation in between these, \"normally\" of 9+/10 is probably ok given the safe neighbourhood. Though 9.0/10 is distinctly borderline whereas 9.9/10 is likely ok, so the decimals matter.\n\nTo me, 8/10 probably is getting into AH territory because that's not a really high rate - leaving door unlocked once every other week. For those 4am trips it sounds as if you need a better process to reduce your human error.\n\nFor example, have a rule that you always put the dog lead back in the same place. And therefore always pick it up from the same place. And keep it in a bag. When you take the dog out, get the lead, leave the bag tied to the inside door handle. When you get back, taking the bag from the door handle can remind you to lock the door. Putting the lead back without the bag will remind you to get the bag which will remind you to lock the door. Sure you'll still forget once in a while, but not 20% of the time, which is a bit of a poor ratio.\n\nIf you can't improve that 20% error rate to more like 2%, especially if you've not tried to improve the process to reduce the problem rate, then you're probably heading towards being the AH. And if the 9+/10 is only barely over 9/10, then same thing. 10/10 is unrealistic and no need to achieve perfection, but to avoid being the AH, you need to do your best, and I doubt that 8/10 or even 9.0/10 is your best.", "NAH, I see both sides. Why not just buy an automatic locking electronic lock?  Unless she's paranoid about hackers.  Then maybe one of those you can't open from the outside without a key.", "NAH in my mind, though I feel like she's right that you should be locking the door every time. I recommend getting a powered deadbolt that automatically locks the bolt every time it's opened. Bonus that you can get one you can connect your phone to open if you lose your keys. It's less than a couple hundred bucks, and will give great piece of mind. I bought one because my kid would forget to lock the door every day on his way to school, so this let me feel safe that my house wasn't unlocked all day long!", "Yta lock the fucking door. Does she need to remind to wipe your ass too?", "NTA.  It's one thing if you were telling us that you don't think doors need to be locked.  You're trying and forgetting.  You're human, not an AH.\n\nCan you buy a doorknob that locks on its own and requires a key to open from the outside?  This way, all you gotta remember to do is close the door.  Both of you will need to remember to carry the key when you leave the house though.", "Hi everyone! I\u2019d like to thank everyone for commenting no matter what judgement you made. I am seeing generally 3 types of YTA justifications  and I would like to respond to them\n\n1. Hardline \u201cJust fucking lock the door\u201d. I totally agree, and that\u2019s my mentality about it too. The problem is that sometimes I forget a couple times a week. I hate it too. Which is why I want to get a perspective on how bad that is. No matter what the determination here is, I\u2019m still going to try to improve. The sticky note method seems like a great idea\n\n2. Treating my wife poorly. This is the one that hurts the most. I did not make this post to say that she is unreasonable or that I\u2019m trying to tell her that her anxious response is wrong. I will always support her no matter what she feels. In fact, we completely agree that in an ideal world the door is locked every time. I just wanted an outside perspective on if my actions up until now made me an AH. Since the whole issue is about safety, I thought it was relevant to give some data points about the safety of the environment we live in\n\n3. The ADHD. I am very sorry if that came of as an excuse. It certainly is not one, rather an explanation. I feel that an excuse would be using it to take no further action. I simply mentioned it to explain why it has been happening at all and why I want to continue to take steps to mitigate the resulting forgetfulness", "NAH. You just have different expectations regarding security. It sounds like you live in a very safe area where it likely isn't a problem to leave the door unlocked occasionally. So while I think it's reasonable for you to try your best to lock the door, I think your wife's fears seem disproportionate. Does your wife talk to a therapist or anything about her extreme anxiety? Or have you asked her whether there's some specific reason, or past trauma, which has caused her fears?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is an issue you should have prioritized from the beginning, forgetting a few times in the beginning is understandable, but still forgetting after so long and so many reminders and pleading? That's not understandable, if you know you tend to forget things then it's on YOU to do what needs to be done so you don't forget. It's your job to figure out and implement the accommodations you need so that you don't forget. Your wife shouldn't have to constantly remind you after (presumably) years, she's not your mom she's your partner.\n\nThe fact you haven't put in the minimal effort it would take to do so makes you the AH because it seems like you think remembering to do something your wife has continuously asked you to do that would lessen her anxiety is not worth the inconvenience it would be to make a note to lock the door or whatever it would take to make sure you **always** lock the door. If I was in your wife's position I would feel very disregarded by my SO and like they don't care how I feel or if they hurt me, it'd feel like they don't respect or care about me.\n\nSo it's more than just forgetting to lock the door occasionally and it seems like you don't see that, whether intentionally or not YTA.
