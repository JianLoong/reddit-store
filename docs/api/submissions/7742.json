My wife also has terrible anxiety about the door being locked, so much so that she physically touches the lock at night to be sure. I grew up in the country where we never locked the doors. It didn't even take me a month to get used to locking the door. Why does it matter if your wife feels safer with the door locked? It takes less than a second for you to lock the thing, just do it.", "I'm gonna say yta. I don't really care how safe your community is, if the person you live with needs locked doors you lock the doors. You figure out a way to ALWAYS lock the door. Especially at 4am.", "Yta- in my relationship we have a rule, if one person cares and the other doesn\u2019t, just do it.  I\u2019m from a safe rural place.  He is not.  He always wants the door locked, so I make damn sure to do it so he feels safe.  Granted, where we live it\u2019s a good idea, but regardless of how that changes, I\u2019m just locking the door.  Let the woman sleep.", "could you get a smart lock that you can control with your phone? It might be pricey but it  sounds like you would be making a worthwhile investment.\n\nEditing to change to YTA: knock it off with trying to explain to your wife how \u201csafe\u201d the neighborhood is. It doesn\u2019t matter what you consider safe. She doesn\u2019t feel safe, and how she feels in her body is the thing that matters. To imply she shouldn\u2019t feel safe gets a little gaslighty.", "YTA \n\nBad things still happen in safe, gated neighborhoods and, bottom line, it\u2019s super important to your wife. It doesn\u2019t take much effort to make sure you lock the freaking door\u2026she\u2019s not being unreasonable with that very basic request. \n\nYou going on about her being \u2018hyper suspicious\u2019 and anxiety driven with her request is borderline gaslighting. Stop being an AH by trying to make her seem overly emotional or unreasonable and just lock the door.", "Soft YTA I'm going to be honest bad things can happen in safe areas. When I was growing up, my parents forgot to lock the front door one night and I ended up being attacked in my bed by an intruder. That was the only time they forgot and we lived in a very safe, upper middle class, suburban area. It took 10 years for the guy to be caught and I now religiously check the locks. So I totally get where your wife is coming from.\n\n\n I'd suggest putting bells on the doors that way if you forget to lock the door you will hear if someone is entering the house.", "YTA.\n\nYou need to develop the habit of locking doors. Make it habitual, and you won't forget.\n\nIf what it takes is a post-it at eye height on the door, saying \"lock me\", or a front door key clipped on to your puppy's leash, so whenever you grab the leash you automatically have the door key in your hand, then do that.", "YTA, just lock the door. Is taking the step to be a little more mindful that big of a hassle? You\u2019re causing your wife added anxiety & now nightmares because you don\u2019t find it necessary, when it takes all of 1 second to turn the lock. \n\nWhen I was 21 I had been living in my own with my son for a few years, one of my friends had a 3 bedroom her grandma owned & asked me to move in after her roommate moved out because she didn\u2019t feel safe living alone & it would be cheaper for us. I worked an office job and she was a waitress, so our schedule were different. I went to bed around 9 made sure to lock up all the doors like I usually do, and when she came home I guess she went outside to smoke & couldn\u2019t get the back door locked and just left it unlocked because it was 2am and she was exhausted. When I went to leave in the morning around 5:30 both the front & back doors were wide open, all the electronics & valuables including the tv were gone. Her boyfriends truck was even stolen. All in the matter of 3 hours. \n\nI have never felt safe after that. I moved out shortly after & now have to touch the lock everytime I go to bed to make sure it\u2019s actually locked. No matter how safe am environment may be, if taking the extra step puts her mind at ease it should be a priority to you. She\u2019s not asking for anything crazy, but continuously ignoring her request will drive her crazy.", "YTA. Not for occasionally forgetting but for not taking it seriously. People deserve to feel safe in their homes and it's something worth putting effort into. Figure out a way to help you remember, forgetting is only an excuse a couple of times and after that it's just a lack of effort. \n\nWhen I was a kid we lived in a rural area and didn't lock our doors during the day but every night my dad did a nightly sweep of the house to make sure everything was locked up and it gave me a sense of security, my husband does the same thing now. I think that would be a nice thing to do for your wife to help with her anxiety.", "My husband and I used to rent his mother\u2019s basement apartment.

Turn it into a ritual. Come in, turn around, push door closed and lock it in a single motion. Put keys on peg or in dish. Take shoes off. Look at the door again to be sure it\u2019s locked. Carry on. \n\nI had to teach my husband this. It\u2019s both terrifying and infuriating to be married to someone who doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit if I\u2019m safe in my own home. You don\u2019t see it that way. I do. So does your wife. So does your insurance company. Hell, maybe even the law sees it that way depending on where you live. \n\nYou\u2019re risking your wife\u2019s safety 10-20% of the time. That\u2019s simply not okay.

Doors had to be locked during the day and a keyed lock on our bedroom.  After we had been married a few years I realized he had been abused by his siblings.  That fear never goes away.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for forgetting, but I do think it\u2019s an asshole move to need to have the huge emotional response make sense to you before you accept it. Explaining to her how safe the neighborhood is is the opposite of accepting it", "NAH - just.\n\nHuman Error is a Thing, humans are not perfect, and some are better at remembering things than others. So it's fair you don't remember every time.\n\nBut locking doors is (at least where I live) very much the normal thing, and your wife is natural to be worried if doors are unlocked. All the more so since women tend to be more vulnerable than men and tend therefore to be more concerned about unlocked doors (though that's a generalisation of course).\n\nThere's a line somewhere though between ok and not ok, which is somewhat subjective:\n\nOne extreme: remembering every time to lock the door except once a year - ok - human error.\n\nAnother extreme: remembering one time a month and forgetting every other time - not ok - failure either of process or effort.\n\nYour situation in between these, \"normally\" of 9+/10 is probably ok given the safe neighbourhood. Though 9.0/10 is distinctly borderline whereas 9.9/10 is likely ok, so the decimals matter.\n\nTo me, 8/10 probably is getting into AH territory because that's not a really high rate - leaving door unlocked once every other week. For those 4am trips it sounds as if you need a better process to reduce your human error.\n\nFor example, have a rule that you always put the dog lead back in the same place. And therefore always pick it up from the same place. And keep it in a bag. When you take the dog out, get the lead, leave the bag tied to the inside door handle. When you get back, taking the bag from the door handle can remind you to lock the door. Putting the lead back without the bag will remind you to get the bag which will remind you to lock the door. Sure you'll still forget once in a while, but not 20% of the time, which is a bit of a poor ratio.\n\nIf you can't improve that 20% error rate to more like 2%, especially if you've not tried to improve the process to reduce the problem rate, then you're probably heading towards being the AH. And if the 9+/10 is only barely over 9/10, then same thing. 10/10 is unrealistic and no need to achieve perfection, but to avoid being the AH, you need to do your best, and I doubt that 8/10 or even 9.0/10 is your best.", "NAH, I see both sides. Why not just buy an automatic locking electronic lock?  Unless she's paranoid about hackers.  Then maybe one of those you can't open from the outside without a key.", "NAH in my mind, though I feel like she's right that you should be locking the door every time. I recommend getting a powered deadbolt that automatically locks the bolt every time it's opened. Bonus that you can get one you can connect your phone to open if you lose your keys. It's less than a couple hundred bucks, and will give great piece of mind. I bought one because my kid would forget to lock the door every day on his way to school, so this let me feel safe that my house wasn't unlocked all day long!", "Yta lock the fucking door. Does she need to remind to wipe your ass too?", "NTA.  It's one thing if you were telling us that you don't think doors need to be locked.  You're trying and forgetting.  You're human, not an AH.\n\nCan you buy a doorknob that locks on its own and requires a key to open from the outside?  This way, all you gotta remember to do is close the door.  Both of you will need to remember to carry the key when you leave the house though.", "Hi everyone! I\u2019d like to thank everyone for commenting no matter what judgement you made. I am seeing generally 3 types of YTA justifications  and I would like to respond to them\n\n1. Hardline \u201cJust fucking lock the door\u201d. I totally agree, and that\u2019s my mentality about it too. The problem is that sometimes I forget a couple times a week. I hate it too. Which is why I want to get a perspective on how bad that is. No matter what the determination here is, I\u2019m still going to try to improve. The sticky note method seems like a great idea\n\n2. Treating my wife poorly. This is the one that hurts the most. I did not make this post to say that she is unreasonable or that I\u2019m trying to tell her that her anxious response is wrong. I will always support her no matter what she feels. In fact, we completely agree that in an ideal world the door is locked every time. I just wanted an outside perspective on if my actions up until now made me an AH. Since the whole issue is about safety, I thought it was relevant to give some data points about the safety of the environment we live in\n\n3. The ADHD. I am very sorry if that came of as an excuse. It certainly is not one, rather an explanation. I feel that an excuse would be using it to take no further action. I simply mentioned it to explain why it has been happening at all and why I want to continue to take steps to mitigate the resulting forgetfulness", "NAH. You just have different expectations regarding security. It sounds like you live in a very safe area where it likely isn't a problem to leave the door unlocked occasionally. So while I think it's reasonable for you to try your best to lock the door, I think your wife's fears seem disproportionate. Does your wife talk to a therapist or anything about her extreme anxiety? Or have you asked her whether there's some specific reason, or past trauma, which has caused her fears?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could do the notes, you could buy a smart lock, you could say a little jingle every time you walk out the door (my forgetful husband literally lists his out-of-the-house items every time he walks out) but repeated forgetfulness translates to \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit that you feel unsafe\u201d wether you mean it to or not.\n\nOne could argue that someone observing you leaving the house at 4am is more dangerous than leaving the home unlocked any other time. It\u2019s dark, everyone is asleep and you and your dog (something that could alert/protect) are not in the home\u2026but your sleeping wife is.", "So what's stopping you from putting up a sticky note right now? Why do your need your wife to do it lol. Be proactive and take responsibility for yourself.", "Serial Killer Richard Chase would only go into unlocked homes to commit his crimes. He felt that if a door was left unlocked he was \u201cwelcomed\u201d. Just some food for thought.", "Nope. You can lock the door. You have found ways to deal with the shit that's important to you, and you haven't done so here because your wife's trauma isn't.", "I can understand that. My husband also has ADHD, and I have anxiety. Maybe see if the sticky notes will help before she goes all out with security cameras?", "I have ADHD also. So does my husband. I get how it can be hard to remember things, and how it can be difficult to start a new routine. \n\nWe both have several different alarms and reminders on our phones for various things throughout the day. I have an alarm for when it\u2019s time to go pick up my kids from school. We have \u201ctake meds\u201d alarms. I have reminders anytime I need to return a phone call, drop off something at the post office, go to the pharmacy, etc. \n\nNow, I\u2019m also a bit paranoid about locking doors because I had my car ransacked once when I forgot to lock it, and I live in an area where that type of thing happens a lot, so locking doors is an absolute must for me. It\u2019s part of my bedtime routine, to go around the house and make sure everything is locked. But, if it\u2019s not normally a part of your routine, you might consider just making an alarm in your phone like \u201clock doors/cars/shed/etc\u201d until it becomes more routine for you.", "Lol ADHD is not an excuse. Also, your original story led me to believe the real reason for not locking the doors is that you don\u2019t feel the need to. Don\u2019t throw ADHD in there as a defense. I don\u2019t blame her for wanting cameras since you clearly don\u2019t respect her wishes", "If the problem persists this much, then yes, you should buy the tech. She\u2019s not being unreasonable.", "I'm just curious, does your ADHD only flare up when it's things that you are dismissive about or do you also routinely forget incredibly important day to day things that you find worthy of being deemed important? Do you show up to work without pants? Leave your car running in the parking garage when you get home? Leave the stove on high overnight? Flood your apartment because remembering to turn off the tap is too difficult? Or is it just when it comes to risking your wife's safety that you shrug and go \"whoopsy doodle, I guess I forgot again!\"?", "INFO- Have you actually been diagnosed with \u201clow grade ADHD?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard of this term from my friends who\u2019ve been diagnosed and I\u2019m genuinely curious.", "I feel like you should mention the ADHD in your original post because that's definitely a factor in you forgetting. But given that factor, you need to figure out a way for you not to forget, whether that's a post-it in a particular spot, a note on the floor, whatever. ADHD explains the forgetfulness but doesn't excuse it if you get what I mean?", "Get a deadbolt that you can install yourself for about $90. It locks itself after about 6 seconds. I have one and it\u2019s pretty handy. My husband was like you about locking the door during the day. Drove me nuts. This solved the problem.", "youre going to make your wife shell out money for a fancy lock because you cant be arsed to do the bare minimum?", "You know what a cheap solution is? GROWING THE FUCK UP AND MAKING A HABIT OF LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.", "Yes, abesolutely YTA. If you, a functioning adult, are incapable of locking the door 100% of the time than you should install automatic door locks.", "Rename your dog Locke. Then you can't forget.\n\nMy attacker came through a cat door.", "Respectfully, are you diagnosed with \"low grade ADHD\" or do things just slip your mind because on some level they seem inconsequential to you? Even if you do have a diagnosed form of ADHD, you still have to make an effort to investigate *why* certain things are not taken seriously by your own brain and stop using \"low grade ADHD\" as an excuse.", "If you can afford a gated community, you can afford some new locks on the door. Get ones that lock automatically, problem solved.", "Your whole post you're trying really hard to make it sound like the issue is just your wife's anxiety about the door being unlocked. But the door being unlocked is the very real, very valid issue. \n\n\nEven a drunk teenage boy wandering into the wrong apartment can be a very real threat to the average woman. Especially if she wakes up to someone already in the house, in the bedroom, or already holding her down. YTA for not taking her safety concerns seriously and trying to make it seem like she's just overly anxious.", "So already it's gone from a few times a month to a couple of times a week\n\nIf your wife was coming home at 4am and was nervous about being alone would you go and meet her or pick her up?  Just to assuage her nerves , after all statistically she'd be fine?\n\nBecause to your wife once that door is unlocked there is no difference to her being on the street outside", "SHE double checks the doors, he proceeds to leave them unlocked. its a simple task, just lock the fucking door. this is childish shit.", "He can set an alarm or the wife could do it too.", "The best he can would be buying a relatively inexpensive item (like a self locking pad lock) if he's unable to get it together enough to lock the door. He's refusing because he thinks his silly wife is being unreasonable wanting to have the door to her apartment locked.", "if it's not hard then he can double check if he locked it.", "Ok and there's plenty of people who go into unlocked homes..again I'm not making it easy...you do you and keep your doors and your car and whatever else unlocked..that's fine..I'll keep mine locked..to each their own", "That may be so..but I'm not making it easier for someone to get in, they're going to need to work at it or smash a window, that I hopefully hear..just like I lock my car doors..I'm not making it easy..IF it does happen. Takes two seconds to lock a door..how lazy is a person", "i cant even leave my apartment without making sure the door is locked, how is that even possible?", "Richard Chase, serial killer and nicknamed \"vampire.

Person who used the door didn\u2019t lock it and none of us live ins thought to lock it because we never use it. Guess which house was broken into that night? Thankfully they only stole our tv, but it could have been SO much worse. As women in general were concerned about safety in a way most men don\u2019t even consider. It\u2019s terrifying knowing someone\u2019s been in your home", "Locksmith here and deal with plenty of break ins.  Guess what, there are a lot of break ins on the good side of town because those are the people that have shit worth stealing...  It's not far fetched for someone to go a neighborhood or two over and try to get the good stuff.", "I get what you're saying. And your partner making snide comments is a jackass move. OP doesn't sound like he's being snide, though, just forgetful and overall less preoccupied about safety. His wife sounds like she's going above and beyond just, \"Hey, honey, can you please try to remember to lock the door?\" but rather having night terrors about it. That is a little extreme. I don't think she's an AH either, but there is a point at which someone can be so preoccupied with safety that it *does* become irrational.", "I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s the protocol for entering their apartment?\n\nI generally felt safer in apartments, especially in new buildings, because you needed a key to enter the front door of the building, and *then* needed one to enter our actual apartment door. In the newest ones you also needed a key to access the stairwell and elevator.\n\nEven in less secure buildings I\u2019d feel better on the third floor, because having to walk all those stairs isn\u2019t the same crime of opportunity as being ground level.\n\nThe only apartment I felt unsafe in was a basement unit where our windows were ground level with the back alley. People would always bang or try to open the windows, and often people would look into the apartment after doing something illegal to see if there were witnesses.", "There was a murder case in a city where I lived where a child was killed by the boyfriend of a resident in an apartment building. \n\nHe was a registered sex offender, but his registered address was his mom\u2019s home.\n\nYou have no idea who lives in your apartment building or who any of the visitors are.", "Seconding getting an electronic lock. If OP is a renter they can get an August lock that keeps the same deadbolt keys etc. They have a setting to auto-lock after X amount of time. It also has an app so you can lock it remotely from bed and integrates with smart home devices to you can do \"Ok Google Lock All Doors\" or even set it to lock with a routine.\n\nThe app is also great for OPs wife b/c she can see the doors are locked from her phone anywhere.", "TY I\u2019m SO sick of that being used as an excuse for literally every fucking thing", "i agree adhd isn't a foolproof excuse but adhd affects your full brain function. adhd changes how your brain looks at consequences so if an adhd person has something slip their mind for whatever reason it's not like that bypasses the adhd part of the brain bc that's impossible\n\ni agree with you though that it's the individual's responsibility to identify these behaviors and figure out a way to trick themselves out of it! that's why i always lock the deadbolt and knob cause if i don't do the second one i'll forget whether i did it at all", "I know for a fact it can be hard, I struggled with this exact situation for years.

It can be on a note in front of my face and I will still be oblivious at times.  If this is causing his wife so much grief, she needs to look out for herself and double check herself, because I doubt she always believes him when he says the doors locked.  All I\u2019m getting from comments like yours is that it\u2019s perfection or nothing, and that\u2019s a one sided outlook in this situation.  Why should people try their hardest to do something specifically for someone else, only to be constantly berated for not doing it good enough?

It sounds like you just picked a side because to you locking door = easy and common sense, not all of us were raised like that, and while I agree the door should be locked, I think that is a responsibility that is split 50/50 and OP is obviously putting forth his part of the effort to change his habits.", ">Why do you think this issue is specifically the husband\u2019s responsibility\n\nbecause he's the one not locking the door, she's already upholding her part in this.\n\n> Do you not understand what living with a bad memory is like?\n\nbad memory is an excuse, there are means to remind yourself and falling back on forgetfulness is a copout. \n\n>Do you not want to empathize with people you simply disagree with?\n\nonly when they deserve empathy. \n\n>think that is a responsibility that is split 50/50\n\nI agree with this, 50 being when she leaves the house, which she upholds, and the other 50 being when he does, which he is failing at."]}
