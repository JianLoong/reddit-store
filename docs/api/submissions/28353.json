She may feel obligated to keep your gift rather than sell it even if it doesn\u2019t suit her lifestyle. Have you considered where she would wear it?

Even if she loves caviar and you are willing to pay it for her, she may have much greater needs that would make more sense filling. You spending the money on caviar, while she may be struggling to buy her child adequate school supplies, even when done with good intentions may be a pretty stupid idea. \n\nI used a bit an extreme example with caviar, but your cleaning lady may have been better off with something else.

But hopefully she can keep it.\n\nAny next gift whether it be xmas, or birthday give her a cash bonus.", ":)", "Thank you, I was trying to figure out what word the OP meant because inadequate didn't make sense. I kept thinking antiquated but that didn't make total sense either. Inappropriate makes much more sense.", "Oh, thanks! That was it: \"inappropriate\". Languages are hard sometimes, right?", "Thank you! This is helpful and something to talk about with my husband.", "She will get a rise by the end of the year, like every year. The gift was something special for her birthday.", "Nice idea", "I need to edit the post", "I hope you understand you did absolutely nothing wrong here. It was a lovely thought & I have no doubt it was very much appreciated. \n\nThe employee/employer balance can be challenging. It is never a bad thing to ask for & hear a different perspective. \n\nHaving been married for 32 years to my wonderful husband \u2026 I understand very well they are not always perfect or right. So I will guess your husband may actually be the ahole on occasion but maybe not for this reason. Lol! \n\nWish you all the best!", "Thank you! And you're right, we all can be aholes through the years, I'm glad I'm not the one this time XD", "NTA but I do wonder if she will feel the need to reciprocate something she can't afford.", "are we sure that OP and spouse understand the meaning of expensive and inadequate?", "NTA, you did not have to give any kind of gift, you did a nice thing. It's not your fault your husband is not at giving as you.", "INFO: I'm confused.....he's complaining it's inadequate because it's *too* expensive?  Inadequate means that something is *lacking* in quantity or quality, or *insufficient* for the purpose.  Make it make sense please.", "NTA. Your husband is just cheap.", "I owned a cleaning business for over 20 years. Most of my clients were with me for years. We always celebrated birthdays and Xmas with mutual gifts. I don\u2019t see the problem here, especially if this person has been with you for a long time and you trust her.", "I'm a cleaner and I'd feel very recognized and thankful for any giftvorvtip in light of a holiday  or birthday. NTA, you're good people.", "NTA... Maybe. The yearly bonus for your cleaning person is supposed to be something like twice their single-time charge, or one to two week's pay, if they work every week for you. This was a generous thing you did, you can never be an AH for giving a gift. Do consider next time, like, for her Christmas bonus, to give your cleaning person the money, because it has far more flexible applicability for her needs. You husband was saying that it was not enough? That's an easy thing to fix.", "NTA. I'm reading this as \"inadequate\" which actually in this context means your husband doesn't think the gift was good enough. Point this out to him that if it's inadequate, then you should get an even pricier gift!", "NTA\n\nI'm going to assume that you mean \"inappropriate\" which is just fine, easy mistake to make.\n\nIn any case, the only nice explanation I can think of is that the item might make your housekeeper a target for robbery. I also wonder if there is a cultural reason against just giving her a cash bonus as a gift - maybe it would be seen as charity or something?\n\nI certainly hope your husband wasn't being snobbish and classist about it.\n\nIf it IS an item like a purse that you might expect to see her wear/use, please don't ask about it if you don't see her with it anymore. Just in case she needed money more and has to sell it.", "NTA. What you did was make a woman's day who holds your house together and probably knows more about you than your family.\n\nI think it was a beautiful gesture that was taken as a meaningful gift.", "Not the asshole, he knew how expensive it was, and he had an issue with it because of how much her salary is. In his mind he thinks it\u2019s too elegant or expensive and she may be looking for that from now on. But he also may be feeling inferior because you bought her a gift, that says \u201chey I see you, I care about you, Thankyou\u201d when he hasn\u2019t cared enough to get her one....", "NTA\n\nIt sounds nice of you.", "I don't think you're an AH, but an expensive gift could be seen  negatively by your cleaning lady, like rubbing it in how much money you have, and she doesn't. Kind if insulting.\n\nShe might think if you can afford to spend this much you could afford to pay her more. \n\nOr she might love it and be really happy. Without knowing her it's difficult.", "In my opinion, you sound like a sweet, kind-hearted person whose heart was in the right place. I think a modest gift or maybe even a \"birthday bonus\" would've shown just as much appreciation. I think giving a flashy gift to someone who works for you has the potential to create resentment and / or blurr boundary lines. Hopefully, I am wrong, and I also hope she appreciated the gift.", "NTA. But my mom used to do this\u2014buy really expensive gifts for our staff (at the office) and for our housekeeper. Which as a kid I was always embarrassed by and always felt was pretty out of touch. People with significantly different incomes have different priorities so while your heart is in the right place I would absolutely recommend a cash bonus with an inexpensive gift to wrap it in. At Christmas I usually do a weeks pay with like a blanket or slippers or coffee cup/gift card combo.", "Info: are you her only client? I think your husband may be misinformed at her true salary. Cleaning ladies with multiple clients can make really good money. My friends cleaning lady charges her 200/week and she has like 10 clients. Unless the gift was worth several thousand, then he probably has the facts wrong.", "I love to spoil my personal exercise trainers with generous gifts to show my appreciation. I see nothing wrong with it, but I always downplay how much I spent to my family and husband because I don't think they'd approve.", "NTA. That was extremely nice of you. Your husband is being weird and stingy.", "You done nothing wrong,in fact it was a lovely gesture from your part.\nIt's nice to be nice and your husband should see that.\nDon't change.", "NTA, but it would be better to give a gift card that can be used in many places. If you\u2019re earning a housekeeper\u2019s wages, that seems the most practical. Leave the the decision to her.", "Okay, agree, but also, the thought counts. \ud83d\udc9c I clean and my fave clients have sent me home with tons of blueberries,  ect, as a nice tip and I was stoked over it. Not saying  I would  turn down a cash gift, but sometimes  it's nice to be considered as an individual,  not just  as a person  who makes money to live.", "Best answer", "This is kind of a silly take. I nannied two boys for three years, was paid a higher than average wage with great benefits ( two weeks paid vacation, plus I got paid when they went on vacation, paid sick days etc) and my employers gave me several gifts worth close to my monthly salary. They bought me a new laptop when mine died, and and when I stopped working for them they bought me a plasma screen that was easily 2x my monthly salary. I also only worked 20 hours a week, and the second year I worked for them they gave me a $5/hr raise without me even asking.", "Us cleaners usually  have  multiple income streams from multiple properties. The income from one is nowhere near enough  to manage, but if she's cleaning  multiple  homes, she's making way more than just the income from this one property.", "Hello! Yes the right word is \"inappropriate\", my mistake. There is no problem in giving her cash, is just that I wanted to give her something special and I didn't though that the price could be a problem until now.\nOf course I'm not going to ask her about the present, I know she may not like it and wanted to sell it or give it to someone else. That was the risk.", "His \"do you know how much she makes in a month\" and him not being cheap usually makes me wonder if he thinks you were flaunting their wealth. Could you ask him if he feels like the cleaner will feel indebted, or if he feels like giving her something so expensive feels like bragging? He could be self concious because to some \" too much\" is just as bad as \"too little\" emotionally.", "Is it possible that he thinks she would have valued more a cash bonus than an extravagant gift? I for sure would prefer 70% of my salary over, say, a purse or a phone that costs 70% of my salary.", "He\u2019s just mad you spent it on \u201cthe help\u201d or someone he thinks is less than himself", "But he may be classist?", "sadly it sounds like he resents someone who he thinks of as \"the poor\" getting to have something above their station. i've known way too many people like that in india :(", "Maybe he feels that the gift illustrates the huge difference between her salary and your lifestyle. In which case, I assure you, she has noticed. And a raise would be a good way to address that.", "I doubt she is uncomfortable, probably thrilled to have a very nice bag! I always appreciated gifts given to me by the couple I nannied for, and I never felt uncomfortable, just appreciated!", "Cash bonuses are great, but so are extravagance that she would never be able to get for herself that she wants. I think if you know it\u2019s something she really wants then it is fine to give physical gifts", "I disagree with money.\n\nMy cleaner refuses to take extra money even when she dog sits for us.\n\nInstead I get her little treats here and there, like a pastry or give her some of my weed and last Christmas bought her a voucher (same as one weeks wage) to a sports store because she started going to a gym.\n\nMoney can be seen as offensive to some people. It can be seen as charity.", "I think what you did was very kind and I\u2019m sure it was appreciated! It feels good when the peoples who\u2019s home you work in show that they value ypu6", "Omg who cares . It\u2019s a GIFT you guys . She wanted it to be more personal then cash and I totally get that .  You did nothing wrong , don\u2019t overthink it .  You are so sweet !!!", "Dang, I need new clients...", "Well, it was a lovely gift and your husband is being very weird.  I definitely hope he doesn't see her as his \"lesser\" or something like that. After all, she does a job (well!) that he doesn't want to do.", "That was my thought, I think there might be an English mixup here, because the word 'inappropriate' makes more sense in context than 'inadequate'. Not trying to put this person down or make fun of their writing but it seems like a misunderstanding of the word", "That was my impression. That she made the housekeeper feel embarrassed, but I\u2019m feeling a lot of mixed things about money atm so idk. We are about to have a significant increase in income (like\u2026$80k more per year, way higher cost of living, but still, we\u2019ll be able to pay our bills and have extra) and I am *preemptively* worried about what to do if I have disposable income and also telling myself we\u2019re still going to struggle to make ends meet. I guess at this point I just feel like \u201cpoor\u201d is part of my identity.", "This was my first thought too.", "As someone who was given a $100+ blanket as a bonus one time--no thanks. I'd much rather have had the money and picked what I want.\n\nThere's a difference between friends and employers. I'd always rather have cash from an employer.", "I mean, not really. I used to be a domestic cleaner about 10 years ago and got \u00a310 an hour and usually did about 2 hours or so work in each house. So for them to do 70% of my wage would be a gift of \u00a37 or \u00a314 which wouldn't be a huge one off expense but may have been unaffordable weekly.", "Especially with \u201cinadequated\u201d"]}
