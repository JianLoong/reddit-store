{"id": 9246, "submission_id": "10uuwx8", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter to learn some social skills and make friends her own age?", "selftext": "I have a 19 year old daughter, Samantha. Samantha doesn't have many friends. She rarely leaves the house except for school or work and never brings people over. She never stays late at school or tries to talk to anybody either. Part of it is because all she talks about is kids (she loves kids, works with kids, and is in school to work with kids), her dog, musicals, and baking. \n\nMy other kids are the exact opposite. I'd get into arguments with them because they were never at home but at least they had social lives, friends, and boyfriends. Sure they got into trouble but I'd rather that than Samantha never going out or talking to anybody. \n\nSamantha is in a math class with a professor that encourages the kids to work together and talk to each other. I thought this would be great for Samantha and I was stoked when she said that she and some other people started a study group. Then she told me about the group. There's her, another 19 year old girl, a 30 year old man, a 35 year old woman, and a 45 year old woman. The worst part is that she mostly only talks to the 35 and 45 year olds. \n\nWe just went to a graduation party for a girl that's exactly like Samantha. The girl didn't know anybody at the party except for her sister and looked miserable the entire time. She talked to two people at the party, a girl close to her age who works a similar job to her and has a pet so they talked about work (kids) and their pets, and a woman 15 years older than her who has a job very similar to what Samantha wants to do and all they talked about was school and that future job.\n\nWhen we were driving home, we were talking about how sad it is that the graduate didn't know anyone at her own party, how she doesn't have any social skills, and that she's going to have a hard time finding a job because she doesn't know how to talk to people. Samantha stayed quiet and I told her if she doesn't figure out how to talk to people and start talking to kids her own age she's going to end up exactly like the graduate. \n\nShe didn't say anything in the car but when we got home she packed a bag, got in the car, and went to my MIL's house. My MIL has always coddled her and told her there's nothing wrong with her when she's asked and has gone so far as to yell at me, kick me out of her house, and even threaten to take me to court for money that my husband and I borrowed but never paid back when I did say that there probably is something wrong with her if she doesn't know how to talk to people like a normal person. My MIL also blames me and my other kids for Samantha being the way she is. Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it. Samantha's friends also preferred to hang out with my older daughter when she brought her friends over but it's not my fault that her friends found my older daughter more interesting. \n\nAITA for telling her to learn social skills and talk to people?", "created_utc": 1675649889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uuwx8/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_learn_some_social/", "score": 315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", ">Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it\n\nYou are very much an asshole.", "At the end you literally showed that it\u2019s quite literally your fault for her being more quiet/reserved. What you say or do to your kids affects them greatly at a young age, making fun of her when she talked a lot as a kid is the reason she talks less now. Also she is able to communicate, some young people just find it easier to talk to adults because they\u2019re usually more mature. Just because she isn\u2019t going out a lot like her siblings doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with her. I understand your worried for your kids social skills but she\u2019s seen talking to people and working with them in that math group. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Why are you trying to micromanage your daughter's social life? It sounds like she's talking to people just fine. She gets to decide who she's friends with, not you.\n\nAnd it sounds like you've been TA her entire life. You belittled your own child for talking, and now you're mad that she isn't a social butterfly? WTF is wrong with you.\n\nDon't be surprised when she finally decides to cut you out of her life. You deserve it.", "so your parenting methods when she was a child made her fear being open and socializing, and you want to continue criticizing the small amount of socializing she's comfortable with as a result of your earlier parenting.... I think I summed that up right.\n\nIf you keep talking to her like that you're going to be the one to blame for her quiet social life, not her. and hey, she might prefer to not be the life of the party. i never was. \n\nand another thing: she'll never get a job is she can't talk to people her own age? in what world is her employer also going to be a 19 year old girl? she seems to do just fine talking to older adults about her work. seems to me you're just mad that she's not as social as you want her to be. get knotted. \n\nYTA.", "Yta.  You basically said she needs to stop being who she is our she'll be a failure.  Way to invalidate your kid.", "YTA, for years my parents did the same thing to me because I was not as social as my brother. They said the same thing you are saying and my brother is the one in dead end job stuck with his few friends in a small town, while I'm thriving in my career in the big city with friends who are like family.", "YTA. You are the shining example of mental abuse to a child. This girl is going to have years of therapy to go through because you have taught her she isn't good enough.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re telling your daughter that she needs to stop being an introvert and become an extrovert because you like extroverts better.", "YTA. You're sitting here wondering why your daughter struggles to communicate with people while also saying you used to make fun of her for openly communicating. And not just you, apparently the whole family did since you said \"we.\" Not only that, apparently she can easily converse with people older than her, which already shows that she has social skills and can talk to people. Your daughter may not relate to people her age, and that's fine, but it seems like you're pushing her to be more like your other children when she is simply her own person. That has to have been so disheartening to hear her own father say she's going to endure hardship simply for being more introverted, and an introversion created by her own family for continually making her the butt of jokes growing up. I suggest being kind and trying to understand and communicate with her more, rather than pushing her away by pointing out things that \\*could\\* happen. Definitely apologize, and not just for this instance. I would strongly suggest apologizing for what you and your family have done in the past as well.

You\u2019ll be lucky to have a relationship with her into adulthood. I personally hope she never looks back.", "YTA. You told your daughter that she\u2019s a failure because she is who she is.

Maybe, just maybe, she likes her life the way it is.  Yes, YTA.  Accept her the way she is.", ">Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it\n\nSounds like we know what caused her to be introverted.

I spend most of my time in my house and my best pal is like 15years older than me. Maybe she just has an old soul. You shouldn\u2019t make her feel like she is inadequate because she isn\u2019t living up to your expectations of what is normal and social. \n\nWhat even is \u2018normal\u2019?! *You* think your daughter is lacking but if she\u2019s happy leave her alone. She should just be able to be herself and be supported by you, the way you talk about your daughter is kind of depressing.", "YTA. Your daughter struggles to make friends and you degrade her for the friends she has made. Shame isn\u2019t a good parenting tool, from one parent to another.", "YTA. You have a daughter who is an introvert and an old soul. There\u2019s nothing wrong w/ her except for your micromanaging. She\u2019ll find her way in life.", "YTA\n\nsome people have trouble with social skills. she\u2019s probably already aware of that. you are comparing her to someone who by your standards isn\u2019t doing well, and in doing that you are belittling her, even if you think you\u2019re helping or trying to give advice. also, she\u2019s an adult. let her live.", "YTA X1000\n\nThe more I read sends me farther down my pit of despair for Samantha", "I feel bad for your daughter, for being criticized by her parent no matter what she does.

Thank God she has someplace to go to get away from your toxicity.", "And the award for Shitty Mom Of The Year goes to.......you, OP. You're not even an AH. You're just awful.", "YTA, obviously. It sounds like you've been bullying your own child her entire life.", "YTA! \nYou openly said that your family used to \"make fun of her\", and now that you're getting the TA verdict, it's now \" We were teasing her.\"\nAlso: \nWhat's up with you and your husband not paying back the money you owe your mil?", "Wonder what the daughters's story is like, most likely very different.", "YTA! You and your family belittled and teased her for speaking. She\u2019s 19! Being able to talk to people of different ages is a skill that will serve her in the real world. Who cares if her friends are older or younger? I have friends that are 20 years older than me or 10-15 years younger than me. Get over yourself. I hope your daughter goes low contact or no contact just to get away from your and family\u2019s toxicity. Thank goodness she has her grandmother\u2026oh\u2026and pay your mil back!", "YTA - both for making fun of your daughter and pressuring her to live up to your short-sighted expectations. Your older daughter who stole her friends likely has a dramatic personality disorder and total lack of boundaries (she couldn\u2019t stand not to be the center of attention and stole the younger daughters friends). You people suck.", "YTA. Yikes. You describe literally bullying your child. There are far better ways to try and encourage your kid to make friends. Making fun of them is a good way to make sure they cut off contact and frankly I think your daughter is better off having no contact if you constantly belittle her.", "YTA - I'm like Samantha even as an adult and you're right, I'm lonely and struggle to make friends. Know who was the cause of that? My mother. Know who also criticized me and asked why I can't just \"be normal like other girls\"? My mother. Did it ever occur to you she has social anxiety because you criticize and degrade people openly in front of her so she wonders if other people talk about her like that too?", "YTA", "You\u2019re cruel. Poor Samantha. YTA.", "YTA, dont be surprised when she moves out and goes LC/NC with you lol. That will be youre reward for your \"parenting\" style.", "YTA - I think Samantha would be a lot more social if she wasn\u2019t criticised for her likes.\n\nSeriously, the stuff you\u2019ve said she talks about is the kinda stuff I hear and *enjoy listening to* at work, and I\u2019m around the same age as your daughter. She sounds like she\u2019s doing fine, stop projecting what you\u2019ll find as sad onto her.", "Lmao what a wild info dump at the end.\n\nYTA, you bullied your daughter", "OMG, what did I just read?!?! YTA, I\u2019m surprised that you have to even ask.", "Ouch Samantha sounds just like me\u2026I used to be super outgoing until people started criticizing how or what I talked about. So I just stopped talking. \n\nYou admit yourself that you guys would make fun of her for being outgoing, how did you expect that to turn out? Her *own family* made fun of how she socialized, so she stopped. \n\nThis is all *your* fault. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat I just read was \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t communicate the way I THINK she should communicate so I\u2019m going to put her down for it\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when she makes her way in the world and leaves you completely behind. If she can communicate with a 30 year old she can communicate to an employer why they should higher her. Everyone has their own social and work communication skills and frankly yours are lacking for publicly bad mouthing your own child. Jeez you\u2019re a crappy parent!", "You remind me a lot of my own mother. She was a loud, dominating extrovert and I am the opposite. She was always pushing me to be everything I am not and making me feel bad about who I am. Sounds like you are exactly the same as to your daughter. Tbh, you hardly sound like you like her at all. Don\u2019t be shocked when she ends up going low/no contact with you and realizes that she can make a found family that loves and excepts her. You\u2019ll honestly deserve it.\n\nYTA.", "You were an awful parent to her, an awful person to your MIL and now you want her to fix herself to be more like you think she should be instead of accepting her for who she is? Yes, YTA.", "So, after you have pretty much destroyed your own child's self esteem, you come here for what? Sympathy?\nYou know, to be hurt by strangers is painful but to be destroyed by family is grievous. I have now forgiven my mother for doing a similar thing to me but ever so often that section of tape plays in my head. It is not a good feeling and I'm in my 60s.\nWhat you have done is truly cruel, IMHO, and you need some help dealing with issues about you that you may be ignoring. Please, get some and stop what you're doing to this young lady. \nWhy are you making negative determinations about your child? You sound like such fun...", "YTA.  When I was a teenager, I didn\u2019t like other teenagers.  I couldn\u2019t relate to them as it all felt very superficial.  I enjoyed spending time with adults and learning from them.  There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the path she is on.  She will figure HER life out her own way.  Stop making her feel bad for being who she is!  Not everyone is a social butterfly and you admit that when she was young, she WAS a chatty and social girl.  YOU took that away from her by making fun of her?!  This comments probably stuck.  She can\u2019t do anything right in your eyes.  She\u2019s social, she gets teased, she\u2019s NOT social, she gets teased. Sounds like you just enjoy tormenting your own child.  It\u2019s no wonder she left to go somewhere she felt supported.", "YTA- support your daughter and get off her back. You are a terrible mother.", "YTA. I was your daughter and now I\u2019m happy and successful with a great career and home. Everyone doesn\u2019t have to be a social butterfly. Also you are terrible for making fun of your daughter.", "YTA. How in earth did you type that whole thing out and not realize that you\u2019re an ass?  Your daughter has hobbies, and is in school. She has interests. Has she said that she wants friends? Has she complained about being lonely? Because the only complaining I see her is you complaining that she\u2019s not social enough for your arbitrary liking. It\u2019s her life. If she is happy and content, then thank your stars that she is safe, content, and healthy. And for the record, what an earth is wrong with liking musicals? Does that make musical fans weird? Have you considered seeing if she would like to do some part of community theater? It doesn\u2019t have to be on the stage, she can work backstage, and do sets or lighting or even hand out progress. Maybe she will make friends with people who share similar interests. Good grief.", "Have you ever thought for a second that maybe just maybe that she\u2019s happy with her life? Maybe she loves having conversations with her elder peers, maybe she\u2019s a introvert who likes her me-time, maybe she\u2019s her own fucking person who\u2019s not like your other kids. Jesus Christ get outta your head. What you said was rude and uncalled for. Yes as a parent you want your kids to be the life of the party and to have those experiences but you can\u2019t force her, talk her into or make it seem like something is wrong with her just bc she isn\u2019t doing \u201ctypical\u201d teen things and a social butterfly. Sincerely, a naturally introverted teenager. YTA.", "\ud83e\udd23 YTA. I'm sorry, you're looking down at your daughter for not having \"social skills\" when your parenting skills are horrid? She learned her social skills from you, an adult who invalidated and made fun of her... Seemingly her whole life. She doesn't talk because you taught her that it's better to keep to herself. She doesn't bring friends around because of you. She talks to adults that give her validation and listen to her. I'm glad she has MIL to stay with, and I hope she stays there for her own sake.", "You\u2019ve proven something I\u2019ve always said: when someone has decided they don\u2019t like you, there\u2019s nothing you can do to ever change their mind. You didn\u2019t like the way she was when she was young and talked too much. You don\u2019t like the way she is now, reticent and selective in whom she opens up to. Why don\u2019t you just be honest and admit you just don\u2019t like her. At least the good news is she\u2019s 19 so you won\u2019t be seeing much of her for long. Huge YTA", "Yta. You're a bully and have no empathy.", "YTA. You created the problem by teasing Samantha and allowing your other kids to do the same. When what you should've done is defend her and punish her siblings accordingly for being such bullies. Now all you can do is complain about the problem that you created. So do the rest of the world a favor and shut your trap.", "YTA. Your daughter sounds like my daughter who is 19 and has Asperger\u2019s and is an introvert. She doesn\u2019t have friends but she is happy. She prefers not to be bullied and criticized by her parents though (I\u2019ve had to work with her dad on this). I try to enjoy who she actually is rather than telling her all the ways she doesn\u2019t \u201cmeasure up\u201d to some sort of arbitrary standard. My daughter is smart and is going to college and will figure out her career path even if she only talks about her favorite subjects and doesn\u2019t have friends. \n\nYour daughter probably talked a lot about her interests when she was little (as people with Asperger\u2019s do). As a younger child my daughter would tell me I didn\u2019t even have to listen to her but she just really needed to talk about these things so I would let her chatter on and on because I loved her.\n\nETA: My daughter has developed more social skills, just later than others. She asks questions and notices things in books and comments on them. My daughter is actually very entertaining sometimes and people enjoy her humor and her insights. She has many talents and it would be so sad if I closed my eyes to her amazing qualities just because she didn\u2019t do things that neurotypical people tend to do. She is our third child (out of four) and she is worthy of our respect and love, even if she chooses to opt out of many things.", "you know that quote \u201ca daughters first bully is her mother\u201d ? ya, that really applies here. yta. sounds like you\u2019ve been the ah her entire life.", "YTA. You made fun of your kid for her social skills and now you\u2019re upset because she\u2019s not doing it anymore", "I\u2019ll sum up your post. \nYou don\u2019t understand your child and you don\u2019t care to. You bullied her and she changed and now you bully her more. Awesome parenting, well done. \nYTA.", "Omg, YTA. Your entire post reeks of AH. There is nothing wrong with your daughter. You say there is just because she\u2019s not the person you think she should be. But everything about your post tells us that she\u2019s more than okay as long as she\u2019s nothing like you. I wish I could say more about what I think of you, but the rules won\u2019t allow it.", "Sometimes there is a post on AITA where the OP is so awful and so clearly TA that I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re for real. This is one of them. On the tiny sliver of a chance that you are for real - YTA. Not everyone is like you. To be successful you do not need to be \u201cchatty\u201d. Accept your daughter for who she is, and at the very least stop bullying her along with her siblings, even if you can\u2019t love her. If what you say is true, you are a terrible mother. Get therapy and maybe Samantha will agree to see you after she leaves home.", "I realize this isn\u2019t the biggest problem here, but it sounds like she\u2019s great at speaking to and working with adults that are a good bit older than her. I would imagine that would be a huge bonus when she begins her career, not a detriment like you said. I doubt her boss will be a girl the same age as her", "what the hell\n\ntelling your child they will be a failure is a great way to motivate them.\n\nYTA", "Wow. \u201cSamantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it\u201d. Here we go. There\u2019s the root cause of the problem. She USED to be social and outgoing apparently but y\u2019all made fun of her. It\u2019s not too hard to extrapolate from there that YOU GUYS are the reason she shut down. Now you\u2019re shitting on her for being introverted. Your MIL is right to blame you guys, but especially you. You were the adult here, and you not only allowed them to make fun of your daughter, you were essentially the ringleader by making fun of her as well!! The information about your MIL is irrelevant, how on earth does your terrible relationship with your MIL relate to the situation at hand? She\u2019s not taking your daughter\u2019s side because she\u2019s biased against you. Being an introvert is not going to prevent your daughter from getting a job. You sound like a terrible parent, and you\u2019ve definitely made Samantha the scapegoat of the family. Of course YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019re a bad mom. Period. Full stop. First you bullied her as a young child. And now you\u2019re calling her a \u201cfailure\u201d because she\u2019s now too introverted to socialize with people her age. If she\u2019s happy and productive that should make you happy. Quite frankly I\u2019m shocked she\u2019s able to be happy with a miserable human such as yourself as her family. I pray she\u2019s soon able to cut contact with you.", "YTA, thank goodness for the MIL. \n\nYou're a bully to your own child. Shame on you.\n\nNot to mention a thief.  Pay your damn debts already.", "Yeah YTA. When I went to college I pretty much went to class and then home or to the library to study alone. I usually didn\u2019t try to make friends with people I had class with or anything really. Why? Because I\u2019m introverted. Going to class and interacting with people when needed was enough to drain my social battery and I looked forward to going home all the time for some alone time. Luckily my dad is similar and understands this. My mom is very extroverted but rather than criticize me for not being very social she just made sure I was happy (which I am). Also the chances are your daughter has fine social skills and will be fine", "YTA.  She is an adult and can be friends with whoever she chooses.", "YTA\n\n>Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it.\n\nThis would actively discourage her from speaking. You shamed your daughter from being social.\n\n>but it's not my fault that her friends found my older daughter more interesting.\n\nYour daughter is well rounded and able to have conversations with a variety of people. She deserve support and encouragement and you offer shame, bullying, and belittlement. This makes you a giant AH and I am so glad your MIL is there for your daughter. Her having an alternative personality and life to what you wanted doesn't mean she isn't socially inept. It just means you have more to learn about and love of your daughter.", "YTA", "YTA. I was like this for a while and I\u2019m sure I would have stayed this way if my parents had said literally anything about it. But guess what? Instead of bullying me into changing, they supported me until I felt comfortable enough to branch out more. Your kid will learn her own way in the world and figure it out. You obviously don\u2019t have enough trust in your kid and it\u2019s making her insecure which is only reinforcing her inability to socialize. If you showed trust in your daughter she would eventually feel trusted and comfortable with herself. Undermining her will never force her to make positive change. ytaaaa.", "YTA. When she was young you made fun of her. Now, you try and tell her how she should communicate and who she should talk to. I urge you to stop for a second and think about your daughters happiness. Not job prospects or conformity, but happiness. You are harming her mental health.", "YTA, and you're also wrong. I was belittled as a child for my attempts at socialization, and I became much like your daughter. 1, I have never had trouble finding, getting, or keeping a job. 2, once I was out from under the thumb of people who bullied me and constantly compared me to others (and of course found me lacking) I had little trouble being social and making as many friends as I need. Stop trying to force your daughter into the box of personality you feel she needs, get off her case, and let her grow and develop on her own. If it doesn't hurt too bad, try even being supportive before she goes NC.\n\nETA: My mother threw me a party similar to what you described. It isn't about celebrating the graduate. It's about celebrating how great mommy (or daddy) did raising a graduate. Having no one there known by the person the party was supposed to honor is on the organizer, not the honoree.", "Wow. Sounds like you disapprove of everything your daughter does. Sorry to hear that you have a happy kid in college who knows what she likes and enjoys. Glad she had the sense to take herself off after that nice chat.", "Holy crap YTA!  Maybe she doesn\u2019t bring people over because she has no emotional safety or support in her own home and every aspect of her life is being micromanaged including her job, interests, career aspirations, and fact that her older sister is openly supported in having no boundaries.  This is pure and simple bullying and emotional abuse.  Hopefully she finds an amazing therapist since it\u2019s quite clear you don\u2019t even like your own kid.  Hopefully she can stay with MIL and have a safe home to grow into herself and who SHE is and wants to be.  She\u2019s not your doll!", "YTA!! You sound like an awful mother. Also the fact that your mad your MIL was going to die you for MONEY YOU OWE her it\u2019s the funniest thing.. liken how dare she ask for the MONEY you took and never paid back.. I wish she would have. \nI\u2019m glad your daughter has her grandma!! I hope she moves in with her and cuts you guys off her life..", "Your kid has found the two social groups least likely to judge her; kids and older adults with more worldly experience.   \n\"My kid's an introvert that avoids people. Also, she used to share her passions and we made fun of her for it.\"  Yeah. Way to go, there. You inflicted emotional abuse and bullied your kid.

Samantha doesn't have many friends. She rarely leaves the house except for school or work and never brings people over. She never stays late at school or tries to talk to anybody either. Part of it is because all she talks about is kids (she loves kids, works with kids, and is in school to work with kids), her dog, musicals, and baking. \n\nMy other kids are the exact opposite. I'd get into arguments with them because they were never at home but at least they had social lives, friends, and boyfriends. Sure they got into trouble but I'd rather that than Samantha never going out or talking to anybody. \n\nSamantha is in a math class with a professor that encourages the kids to work together and talk to each other. I thought this would be great for Samantha and I was stoked when she said that she and some other people started a study group. Then she told me about the group. There's her, another 19 year old girl, a 30 year old man, a 35 year old woman, and a 45 year old woman. The worst part is that she mostly only talks to the 35 and 45 year olds. \n\nWe just went to a graduation party for a girl that's exactly like Samantha. The girl didn't know anybody at the party except for her sister and looked miserable the entire time. She talked to two people at the party, a girl close to her age who works a similar job to her and has a pet so they talked about work (kids) and their pets, and a woman 15 years older than her who has a job very similar to what Samantha wants to do and all they talked about was school and that future job.\n\nWhen we were driving home, we were talking about how sad it is that the graduate didn't know anyone at her own party, how she doesn't have any social skills, and that she's going to have a hard time finding a job because she doesn't know how to talk to people. Samantha stayed quiet and I told her if she doesn't figure out how to talk to people and start talking to kids her own age she's going to end up exactly like the graduate. \n\nShe didn't say anything in the car but when we got home she packed a bag, got in the car, and went to my MIL's house. My MIL has always coddled her and told her there's nothing wrong with her when she's asked and has gone so far as to yell at me, kick me out of her house, and even threaten to take me to court for money that my husband and I borrowed but never paid back when I did say that there probably is something wrong with her if she doesn't know how to talk to people like a normal person. My MIL also blames me and my other kids for Samantha being the way she is. Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it. Samantha's friends also preferred to hang out with my older daughter when she brought her friends over but it's not my fault that her friends found my older daughter more interesting. \n\nAITA for telling her to learn social skills and talk to people?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's not going to be able to get a job if she can't talk to people.\" Yep, that's your comment, and i had internalized every bit of it back then. it was an awful feeling- the one thing i wanted so desperately to fix about myself was the thing that was going to hold me back!\n\nthen i started college and everything changed...well, everything but me. i didn't suddenly relate to the other kids-but i started pursuing a career in research. in my coworkers i found people, albeit much older, that i could share my interest with and felt comfortable doing so! even though some of those communication barriers i've always felt remained, they accepted me in spite of that and made me feel valued. over the past few years i've met more and more who did the same, and that helped me undo some of the damage that those bullies had wrought. now that i was one of the adults i'd once related to, not being ostracized was a surprising but wonderful feeling.\n\ncontrary to being a failure, i'm graduating college at 18 and continuing my research as i apply to medical and graduate school. it turned out that i was never what was broken, it was the narrow lenses through which others constantly viewed me. sometimes i want to scream it to my past self from the rooftops- hey!! you were never the problem!!\n\nyta", ">Samantha used to tell everyone everything when she was younger and we used to make fun of her for it\n\nAh yes, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of your own actions.

So many things wrong here.\n\n1) where or how do you think children learn socialization? From their parents!  If she was having trouble making friends or relating to kids her own age, you should have been actively helping her do that as she was growing.  Playdates where you help teach her how to interact.  Sports teams where you are there to guide her when she gets awkward.  This stuff is learnt...it comes easier for some kids but others need guidance.  So this squarely lays on your shoulders.\n\n2) Goes with number 1--she could be neurodivergent.  Again, squarely your responsibility to figure it out and provide the guidance and support she needs.\n\n3) she sounds awesome and the skillset of being able to get along with people of various ages and generations and easily interact with them will help her incredibly well as she moves into the professional world.  I have friends who are 86.  I am nowhere near 86.  I am in the corporate world.  From my very early days in my career, I was never shy or scared to go speak to the CEOs (of some very major companies).  I attribute this to the fact that I never saw age--so no one was intimidating to me.\n\n4) that skillset will also allow her to have a much broader world view.  Depending on where you are in your life you have such different perspectives and there is sooooo much to learn from people of various ages and generations and experiences and backgrounds.  That perspective and input is invaluable.  Not everyone has the ability to relate to an 56 year old when they are 19.
