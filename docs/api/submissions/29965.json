We are 22 and nearly everyone in our friend group kind of thought she was being a little bit crazy because her boyfriend seemed like a great guy. So we always just tried to talk her down, tell her to trust him, he\u2019s in a busy program at work and things will get better.   She was heartbroken when he told her he had fill in duty (he\u2019s a new cop) on Saturday night and couldn\u2019t do the couple costume she planned for them. \n\nI got invited to a party hosted by a coworker last minute on Saturday  and told my friend it would be good for her to go and just get out instead of doom scrolling. We went and it was a huge party and we did not really anyone there but we had a blast dressed up like last minute slu77y vampires. \n\nAt about 1am her boyfriend sort of just appeared in the crowd and when I saw the red football Jersey my heart sank because about a minute later a girl dressed up as Taylor swift came up and held his hand. My friend saw it and she immediately ran for a bathroom sobbing. In the bathroom she went from pleading with god that this wasn\u2019t real to out and out rage and back again.  I told her we needed to leave. She said no she had to confront him. I asked her if she confronted him was she going to do something that would end her up in jail. She said maybe and she was serious. I said to her we had to leave. She said no. I told her to wait and went to find my coworker to help he make her leave. We ended up dragging her out and she made such a scene that her boyfriend finally noticed she was at the party and he took off like a scared rabbit.  \n\nWe got to my house and she started pounding shots so I grabbed her keys and tried to get her to go to bed and she kept screaming how \u201ceveryone fucks me over, including you.\u201d Finally she fell asleep but woke up hungover and angry that I didn\u2019t let her find out what was going on. I said we knew what was going on, he\u2019s cheating. She called me a horrible friend for not believing her for the past few weeks. I said I was so sorry. She said I\u2019m a major asshole for making her leave because she could have caught him in the act and made a clean break. I said she was scaring me with how she was talking in the bathroom. She said she\u2019s an adult and can make her own choices. She said it\u2019s going to be a long time before she can forgive me and left and I think she\u2019s blocked me on every thing.\n\nI feel bad for the whole situation and I feel bad that I may have made the wrong decision. AITA?\n\nEdit: a lot of people are saying I made her leave because she make a scene, no like I said in the OP I didn\u2019t want her to go to jail. I didn\u2019t know how much detail I could put in but she was seriously looking for sharp things in the bathroom drawers.", "created_utc": 1698668533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17js53b/aita_for_forcing_my_best_friend_to_leave_a/", "score": 1110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not without reason, of course. \n\nIn that moment she saw him with another person, 8 years of her young life essentially went flying out the window. An entire future (that was already fraught with fragility as you say she'd had her concerns before) that she'd been envisioning evaporated in a matter of minutes. Months of suspicions came true. \n\nOn top of that, her best friends had been telling her she was being a bit crazy, perhaps. So she's not only feeling the betrayal of her BF, but that everything that I described above is also a result of being assured she was overreacting to his actions by her closest friends.\n\nIn that moment, it probably felt as though her entire life was falling apart from the bottom up. What you describe is a person that is not thinking clearly. She *outright told you* she might do something that gets the cops called on her... \n\nSo what are the alternatives at that point? You wash your hands of the situation and let her fly? You tell her shitty bf to watch out (causing her to feel more betrayed)? That seems like something a shitty friend would do. \n\nTo me, it seems like you made the choice that you knew could be damaging to the relationship but also was the right decision. She subsequently went home and started to get hammered - this is not a person for whom rational thought is controlling her actions. She's feeling a tsunami of negative emotions, and has a lot of people to aim them towards.\n\nWhether or not you *SHOULD* have been telling her not to worry about her bf is something we can't know from what you wrote. You bear responsibility for her feeling betrayed by that, but only the two of you can determine retroactively if that makes any sense. But the AITA seems to be centered on your actions after she figured it out - in which case NTA. \n\nGive her some time to process the emotions. If what you're saying is all true and she's a person capable of self-reflection, she'll probably see what you did as a favor if given enough time. Either way, be supportive and try not to take offense to her lashing out (at least at first). Sometimes the people that need support the most want it the least.", "YTA.

Her reaction wasn\u2019t just because he was cheating, it was because you and her other friends made her feel crazy when she was right. Her behavior that scared you is her having to process and try to rectify all the undeserved guilt and doubt she\u2019s felt because you\u2019ve been undermining her. In a vacuum where you were a good friend from the beginning and listened without passing judgement so much you might\u2019ve been right to rush her out like you did.

There is nothing more satisfying to confront a cheater infront of all the others. Idk, i can understand the anger and the frustration of not being able to do something, in combination with you all not believing her and just labeling her as crazy; it just seems wrong to me and as if you all dont take her serious at all. \n\nYou should have supported her.

She\u2019s just in a bad spot and honestly, probably felt like she was the only person in her corner with how the friend group constantly dismissed her. Plus this is an 8 year relationship?

They need to be heard, have their worries acknowledged unless they are wild assumptions, and even if they _are_ wild assumptions it's usually very cool to reassure them that you've got their back either way. \n\n_Of course_ when my mom had to take the driving test to renew he license I told her I was sure she was going to do great. _Because I believed it_ and because confidence is key to pass it. \n\nWhen my dad gets scanned to see if his cancer is kept at bay, we send him support and best wishes, but no one is so delusional as to try to convince him that it will be ok. Because it very much might not. We do celebrate when they come back ok, and if they ever don't then we'll deal with it head on. \n\nThrowing \"It will be ok\" at any situation regardless of context is just a way to minimize people's feelings and not get too invested in anyone's worries.

And can you blame the friend for being so emotional about it all when her boyfriend and all her friends were calling her crazy for who knows how long when she suspected cheating, and now she has the proof right in front of her face but she's being dragged away by some overbearing pseudo-mom? Pretty sure most people would he understandably worked up about all that, so using the word \"hysterical\" seems gross here. \n\nTo be clear before anyone jumps on me: I'm not saying let her physically assault someone. I'm saying he deserved to be called out, the friend should have gotten her chance to do so *verbally*.
