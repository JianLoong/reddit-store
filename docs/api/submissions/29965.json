We are 22 and nearly everyone in our friend group kind of thought she was being a little bit crazy because her boyfriend seemed like a great guy. So we always just tried to talk her down, tell her to trust him, he\u2019s in a busy program at work and things will get better.   She was heartbroken when he told her he had fill in duty (he\u2019s a new cop) on Saturday night and couldn\u2019t do the couple costume she planned for them. \n\nI got invited to a party hosted by a coworker last minute on Saturday  and told my friend it would be good for her to go and just get out instead of doom scrolling. We went and it was a huge party and we did not really anyone there but we had a blast dressed up like last minute slu77y vampires. \n\nAt about 1am her boyfriend sort of just appeared in the crowd and when I saw the red football Jersey my heart sank because about a minute later a girl dressed up as Taylor swift came up and held his hand. My friend saw it and she immediately ran for a bathroom sobbing. In the bathroom she went from pleading with god that this wasn\u2019t real to out and out rage and back again.  I told her we needed to leave. She said no she had to confront him. I asked her if she confronted him was she going to do something that would end her up in jail. She said maybe and she was serious. I said to her we had to leave. She said no. I told her to wait and went to find my coworker to help he make her leave. We ended up dragging her out and she made such a scene that her boyfriend finally noticed she was at the party and he took off like a scared rabbit.  \n\nWe got to my house and she started pounding shots so I grabbed her keys and tried to get her to go to bed and she kept screaming how \u201ceveryone fucks me over, including you.\u201d Finally she fell asleep but woke up hungover and angry that I didn\u2019t let her find out what was going on. I said we knew what was going on, he\u2019s cheating. She called me a horrible friend for not believing her for the past few weeks. I said I was so sorry. She said I\u2019m a major asshole for making her leave because she could have caught him in the act and made a clean break. I said she was scaring me with how she was talking in the bathroom. She said she\u2019s an adult and can make her own choices. She said it\u2019s going to be a long time before she can forgive me and left and I think she\u2019s blocked me on every thing.\n\nI feel bad for the whole situation and I feel bad that I may have made the wrong decision.

However her response is disgusting, so if I were you I\u2019d stay well out of it and not contact her. IF she decides to apologise, take it from there.", "YTA\n\nI can see you tried to protect your friend. However, dragging her out is too much, don't make decisions for her. And believe and support her next time she suspects something.", "NTA. You were trying to protect your friend from making a shitty situation worse. She's taking her hurt and anger out on you because you're there to receive it. She will lively come to you when she's called down a bit - although it might take her some time to see that you were looking out for her and had no way of knowing that her boyfriend would show up.", "NTA.  \n\nEven though you turned out to be mistaken about some things, you acted in good faith with your friend\u2019s best interests at heart throughout this situation.  Also, your judgement was probably spot-on in taking the friend away from the party, when her staying there would have resulted in AT BEST a big public scene.  \n\nI suspect that, in time, your friend will come to understand your position here and your relationship will get back on track - she\u2019s obviously in a heightened emotional state due to the situation with her now-ex and the fact she was drinking at the time, so she likely just needs time and space in order to get some perspective on the matter.  Hopefully that\u2019s the case but in the event that it\u2019s not, take comfort in knowing that this situation is the fault of her cheating partner, and ultimately he, not you, is the A.", "If you knew her BF was cheating and you still gaslighted your friend when she mentioned her suspicions then YTA without a doubt.\n\nGood Friends don't treat people like that.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend was drunk, hurt, and angry. She took it out on you. Once she\u2019s sober and had time to think, I\u2019d imagine she\u2019ll seek you out.", "NTA, I think your friend is misdirecting her anger at you. She will realize she\u2019s mad at her ex and not you soon just wait it out", "You're the asshole. First you didn't believe her, you just discounted her suspicions because \"he's a nice guy.\" Secondly,you removed her agency in this situation. It wasn't your decision to make whether she made a scene or not. Who are you to drag her out? Why did you want to prevent a scene, did you want to not embarrass the boyfriend? You're not a good friend to her. You were substituting your judgment for her's. What makes you think you know better? You are the asshole and not a very good friend.", "hard to judge but i go with NTA. forcing is never a good way to go about things but she was drunk and ready to make serious mistakes. she can still cut him dry, but atleast you prevented some immediate bloodshed. i dont think she will be angry with you for long. she has other fights to fight for now.", "YTA\n\nI mean, I feel like yo'ure trying to take a cop out (no pun intended) by asking the wrong question (Was I the asshole for making her leave?) to sideline the core reason she's mad at you guys.\n\nShe has every single right to be angry that you didn't even believe her to begin with. She has every right to be angry about how it all unfolded thereon afterwards. It probably felt like a huge slap in the face to be with her friend who reassured her that everything was fine and see him walking in with another girl.\n\nIt probably was best she didn't confront while emotions were high, but you don't get points for steering her away from that when you all were denying her reality to begin with and took his side simply because \"he seemed like a good guy.\" You could've given her an inch of space for her thoughts and observation without denying them, that's where you failed as a friend.\n\nYou already gave her a huge sense of betrayal by not believing her, and any damage mitigation you tried to do thereon afterwards doesn't erase that or make you a better person. \n\nIf anything it seems you have a problem with always invalidating how she feels.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have no business defending the partner! You are there to help Friend. \n\nAlso... NTA, In a while she'll forgive you.", "YTA \n\nAnd an interfering drama queen. You dismiss her feelings about the cheating, then you decide she needs to get dragged out of the party because you decided she's going to go too far in confronting him. Yup.\n\nIf you like too be in the middle of everything so much (and actually like your friend and not just like how you can control her) go up to her bf and just tell him. Tell him you both saw him in the couples costume, holding hands with the girl, that your friend had long suspected him of cheating, and that her needs to talk it out with your ex friend.", "NTA. You were genuinely concerned for your best friend's well-being, and given her emotional state and the fact that she was talking about doing something that could land her in trouble, you made the right call in insisting on leaving the party. I still think you overreacted with making her leave, but your actions were driven by genuine concern for her safety and emotional well-being. You made the right call by trying to get her out of a potentially harmful situation.", "YTA\n\nThey clearly aren't your best friend. I don't like applying labels to relationships, but a \"best friend\" for me is someone I will do anything for, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nFrankly the second you admitted to knowing he was cheating I would have went after you, physically.", "I honestly think you did the right thing. If you believe something could have escalated to the point of cops needing to be involved then you absolutely did the right thing!! You seemed to be a good friend doing the thing a TRUE friend would do which is not encourage her to make a scene but to remain the person she is and allow her to handle this after the initial shock wore off!! \n\nNTA!\n\n**also, I mean, we gotta see these costumes yall wore. Right? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude02", "I mean, she didn't tho.  Nobody knew he was cheating, until they saw him walk into the party, cheating.", "That\u2019s not gaslighting", "You have \\*massively\\* misinterpreted the post.  Maybe go back and read it again?", "WTF? OP seems to have only known he was cheating after he walked into the party holding hands with another woman. She wasn't hiding it, she simply confirmed it the next morning.", "Also the guy is a cop. The moment she even slightly escalated things (which seemed pretty likely from what OP said) she could have been in for some pretty unpleasant consequences. I do think OP is a very soft YTA for brushing off her friend's concerns about her partner cheating, but her actions that evening were absolutely in her friend's interests and hopefully once she calms down she'll see that.", "No", "Ehh I think at that age everyone is thinking their \u201ctrue love\u201d is cheating. Just part of being that age so I can understand the brush off as a friend.\n\n\nBut yeah. You\u2019re right. I forgot he was a cop as well. This friend is a TRUE friend! That girl better unblock her and get this girl free Starbucks and chick fil a for lunch lol"]}
