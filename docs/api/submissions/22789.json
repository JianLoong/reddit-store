Tell your brother to get bent, and decline any further favors until he's apologized.", "I could almost guarantee those little girls are talking about what a great time they had at your house since they got back and your brother just feels shitty because he thinks they like you more than him lol", "In my home growing up we exclusively ate dinner on the couch watching tv. When we had a dining table it was usually covered with whatever project my mom was working on at the time and so we sat on the couch for every meal every day. \n\nMy husband and I don\u2019t let the kids eat meals on the couch now, since they\u2019re 3 and 1 but we eat snacks there and I eat breakfast there at least once a week still.\n\nNTA, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being told how to use your own furniture.", "NTA. We ate on the couch with TV trays for 9 years. Then we bought a house with room to put a dining table where you can see the TV. My kid is an honors student, chess champion, and we eat dinner together 6 days a week. Your brother is controlling and uptight over nothing", "We eat at the table together, but I really don't think it's that serious to get upset over. Especially since you said irs your couch, so it's not like their furniture got ruined. Your brother is overreacting, in my opinion. NTA", "NTA. Brother in an ungrateful ass. You dud nothing wrong!", "NTA.  You aren't a mind reader, and they didn't give you micromanaging instructions.  They are old enough to understand the rules in one place can be different from the rules in another place.  No harm done.", "NTA\n\nYou took good care of two kids while your brother went off on a fancy ass Caribbean cruise. Please print out some of the replies in this thread and show them to him.", "NTA!\nYou\u2019re just the cool uncle now! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nI just hope YOU had an ok time with them there lol", "NTA. It's your couch.", "NTA your brother has a stick in his ass.", "Two weeks!? Yeah, you're NTA at all. Thanks for keeping them safe and happy! They'll always remember the time they spent with you.", "You were very kind to watch his kids for TWO WEEKS. And he has the nerve to get upset that they ate dinner on a couch that\u2019s not even his!\n\nNTA. I\u2019m a mom and I don\u2019t like my kids eating on the couch either. But if the owner of said couch has no problem with it, I\u2019m not going to raise a fuss. And again, you watched his kids for two weeks.", "Since they didn't leave instructions it was up to you to decide what the rules were about eating on the couch.  NTAH.", "We eat dinner in the living room every day. My niece has her rocking chair that she sits on, my sister and her boyfriend sit on the big couch while I sit on the loveseat. For holidays we set up a table in the dining room/office and sometimes the kids sit around the living room coffee table while the adults are in the dining room.\n\nNta, different houses have different eating habits. You did your brother and sister in law a favor and followed their important instructions following bed times and screen times. Where you guys are dinner shouldn\u2019t matter as long as the kids were fed!! \n\nI would explain to your brother that you did them a favor so that they could take a vacation without the kids so complaining about where they ate is a minuscule thing to be upset about. How they do dinner at their house is their business and how you do dinner at your house is your business! \n\nFinal judgment: NTA!!", "Two weeks of eating meals on the couch is not something that is going to seriously impact the rest of their lives and I\u2019d be smart to see it that way.", "Actually u make them feel happy and ur brother mad, NTA he should told u about the \"rules\" he makes", "Eating on the couch everyday for the rest of their life isn't going to hurt them. Idk why I'm so unreasonably mad at the brother \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this just seems terrible", "Exactly. The most the brother has to explain is that eating on the couch is allowed at OP\u2019s house but not in their own home, and the matter is settled. Different families have different rules.", "My kids are not allowed to eat near my couch.  Them gremlins will drop food everywhere!  That said, if someone else want to let them eat on their couch, and not expect me to clean it up, never mind free babysitting\u2026have at it!", "> Tell your brother he mispronounced \"Thank You.\"\n\nAmen.", "My kids are little, but I can't even find someone to watch them for a day! I have to miss a wedding because it's my husband's side of the family and no one from my side is willing (and it's three little kids, including supper and bedtime, so I don't trust a teen to handle it)", "And these kids are DEFINITELY old enough to understand that a rule at aunties house can be different from rules at home. Plus it\u2019s kind of a vacation for them too, staying somewhere else for 2 weeks. \nNTA", "It's not a habit if it only happens at uncle/auntie's house.", "Doing things differently can make kids homesick or it can be something than makes you fun family. I remember staying with my grandma and eating soup with a straw.  I did not go home expecting to eat with a straw.  It was just something fun we did with grandma.\n\nETA: they are older kids not toddlers.  Not a big deal to eat on the couch as a treat.", "When I was a wee little thing my aunt always let me eat in her living room. Her adult children always gave her shit for it because she never let them eat in there growing up lol", "I can't fathom a 12 and 13 year old having memories specifically around how fun it was to eat on a couch while their parents had a nice holiday.\n\nThat seems so deeply sad.", "Growing up my mom had a \"no eating dinner on the couch\" rule so naturally whenever she went out of town on a work trip my dad and I would eat EVERY dinner on the couch while watching the simpsons (which was another thing I wasn't allowed to do). I really do treasure those memories!!", "When I was growing up, once a week we were allowed to eat in the living room in front of the TV, all together as a family. I have fond memories of that, it was special family time together, so much so I mentioned it in my dad's eulogy. Children remember these things more than you might expect.", "I meeeaaaaaannnn i can't speak for OP, but i love hanging out with my nephews. I'm not going to stop watching them any time my brother's a jerk. Sure it punishes him, but it also punishes me and (i like to think) my nephews.", "No, no, no!  It sounds like the nieces had a grand time.  No need to punish them because their dad is a jerk.", "Given what this implies about the nieces home life, I hope not.", "Also not who you asked, but I just don\u2019t allow anyone to eat on the couch or anywhere in the house that isn\u2019t the kitchen or dining area.  Keeping the house clean is hard enough without adding opportunities for food to get on and possibly ruin things that aren\u2019t easy to clean.  (I grew up in the southern US where any excess food anywhere attracted ants and cockroaches.  My desire to keep my house roach-free (even though I don\u2019t live there anymore) and to keep food out of the couch, the keyboards, the carpet, etc. has not lessened any as I\u2019ve gotten older.)", "Preach! Inlaws don't want the kids to have junk food before dinner. Sounds like parents should've fed the kids before going out to dinner themselves and dumping the kids here.\n\n\"Cmon guys, let's go have some ice cream\" I'm just waiting for the inlaws to say something to my face so I can tell em straight up this isn't their house but they're too scared I guess", "Love it! And \"Auntie Bustelo\" sounds like a character from CATS", "Most parents don\u2019t have their kids eating dinner on a boat, so\u2026", "Same. Plus if I\u2019m not hanging with my niece and nephew anymore then explaining my Lego budget gets more difficult.", "Not to mention, crumbs and stuff do get into the crevices you can't clean. My hubby eats popcorn and chips on the couch... You can't SEE anything, and he thinks he's careful, but don't stick your hand down in there when you are looking for the remote he lost LOL", "Thanks!", "Thanks", "> I babysit, the parents are made well aware that we follow Auntie Bustelo's rules in her house.\n\nThe parents consented.", "> My MIL follows same logic and secretly gives my son cows milk because he likes it, even though he is not allowed it, as it gives him really bad eczema.\n\nWhy are you letting this abuse go on?  \n\nAuntie Bustelo isn't giving them anything secretly, she's doing it with the parents' consent.", "My two siblings and I used to stay overnight at my Grandparents on a fairly regular basis, and sometimes my 3 cousins would join us for a sleepover\n\nMy grandma used to buy loads of snacks and rent a movie for these big sleepovers so we could have midnight snacks and a cheeky film\n\nIt didn't effect any of our sleep or eating schedules but it's something all 6 of us look back on fondly\n\nNTA, OP, I hope your nieces look back on their time with you fondly! That's part of the fun of being an aunt, uncle, grandparent etc- spoiling those kids!", "ANY time a kid can see how other people live its a good thing. (Within reason and safety/moral constraints obviously). Kids need to know that there is a wide world out there and not everyone lives like their family.", "BWAHAHAHA \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think there's perhaps a *little* leeway *some* of the time. \n\nI'm thinking... oh, maybe you don't want your kids having ice cream except one day a week. You don't *tell me* this, so I buy your kids ice cream as a treat when we're at Coney Island or whatever, and when your kids say \"Oh, but Mom says\" while I'm standing there with the ice cream melting in my hands I say \"Well, just this one time, and I'll talk to your mom\" on the assumption that if it was an important rule, you would've told me directly rather than relying on your kids to tell me.", "LEavE mY kIdS AlOnE", "He\u2019s replying to auntie bustelo, who lets the kids have soda when their parents don\u2019t", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Me and my sister always stayed at our grandparents and they didn\u2019t eat cereal so they always bought those little multi-pack boxes with assorted cereals. It still makes me smile thinking about getting up earlier than my sister to grab the best flavor lol\n\nThat and playing Dr Mario on Nintendo with my grandpa lol", "This is such an important point, & one that's so frequently overlooked.", "Yeah, sure, but that is obviously not what that person was doing. She said it was in their home. I\u2019m pretty sure she could either drink the soda herself if it were opened or put it back in the fridge. The way she portrays it is a blatant disregard of known rules by the parents, and that\u2019s not okay.", "Auntie Bustelo does that with the parents' consent.", "Your parents aren\u2019t the reason you\u2019re addicted to caffeine. You said they allowed you to. For  if you and giving you a choice are two different things. The habit you have is your own fault. Take accountability", " Literally every other meal was in front of the tv.", "My grampa made the biggest pancakes, even bigger than the plate. Me and my brother laughed so hard. Its one of my favorite memories. Give your grampa a big hug! I miss mine.", "That's a great memory too! Funny how the smallest of things stick with us through the years", "I don't disagree, I just wanted to make sure that we weren't veering off into unreasonable land.\n\nAnd, honestly, that person's relatives don't seem to have objected to her style of babysitting - or if they did, they kept letting her do it - so I guess their rule wasn't as important to them as the overarching rule of \"Well, her house, her rules, she's watching the kids for us!\" \n\nI imagine you did actually tell people, before letting them watch your kids, that sugary treats weren't allowed, in which case they'd have no excuse for not knowing.", "May want to read a bit better, I don\u2019t struggle with caffeine, I struggle with drinking flavored drinks. I take full accountability, but to act as though habits aren\u2019t formed in childhood is delusional, and it\u2019s more so from the fact I didn\u2019t grow up drinking water, so water doesn\u2019t appeal to me. It\u2019s less \u201ccan\u2019t kick a habit\u201d and more \u201cstruggle to form a new one\u201d. Take the high horse elsewhere, yes, what you feed kids 100% affects them as an adult. Go read some studies if you\u2019re actually that unaware that kids that grow up eating healthy diets have healthier and more balanced diets as adults than kids who grew up eating junk food. Your childhood definitely creates a set point for what sort of foods you gravitate towards, I thought that\u2019s like common sense but I guess not. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to never let a kid have anything unhealthy, but a parent\u2019s decision on what sort of diets to expose their kid to should 100% be respected, especially when it\u2019s not causing harm to a child (either obesity or disorder eating).", "No, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m generally pretty reasonable. I get \u201cyou\u201d (general) may think a soda or treat isn\u2019t bad, but if it goes against the direct and known wishes of the parent, you\u2019re an AH and completely disrespectful if you disregard that \u201crule\u201d. They aren\u2019t your kids and you don\u2019t get to make those choices for the parents. There are many \u201cright\u201d ways to raise a kid. For you, moderation of unhealthy foods is right. For someone else, using healthy alternatives to unhealthy foods is right. Neither is wrong and both should be respected. If you can\u2019t do that, don\u2019t be surprised if you lose access to the kids, imo.", "\u201cI cannot tell you how much I wish my parents never allowed me to have soda because to this day I still struggle to kick the habit\u201d I see where you\u2019re coming from but I\u2019m not on a \u201chigh horse\u201d this is Reddit. I replied off the context you provided. Nowhere in this does it say. My parents allowed me to drink soda and as an adult I don\u2019t drink it. Haven\u2019t in a long time.\nEdit: there\u2019s some things you can attribute to you\u2019re parents but, you\u2019re not living with them I\u2019m guessing so all the choices and \u201chabits\u201d you have today are yours to kick. My mother is an alcoholic and my dad is a drug addict. I don\u2019t partake in either so I just hope you see the difference I was pointing out. No hard feelings. Seems like everyone is on one today\nOn Reddit lol"]}
