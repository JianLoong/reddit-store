I hope to raise my kid the same way...just gotta get the wife on board.", "Yeah I get for young kids routine is important and they\u2019re just grasping manners and stuff like that. \n\nI guess I was just wondering because I love snacking while watching TV so we do eat on the couch. My husband grew up with more rigid rules and aren\u2019t allowed to eat anywhere but the kitchen/dining. His brother implemented the same rule with his kids. His eldest is 18 - she left and planning on never coming back. She spent every weekend and holiday at ours cause her anxiety is more under control here. I thought that her dad was being unreasonable but since being on Reddit I\u2019m questioning myself. Maybe it is far more common to have rigid rules than I thought. I don\u2019t have much rules now that my kids are well into their teens. I just want them to be comfortable being at home and feel like it\u2019s their home. So the only rule we have is be kind. So if they make a mess, they\u2019ll clean it up so no one will have to do extra work and there won\u2019t be any unwanted critters. Same rule for my niece when she\u2019s here. My mom/dad and aunts and uncles (22 from both sides excluding spouses), cousins and my friends are all similar to me so growing up it\u2019s just the norm.", "Can you adopt me and also send me to grandma's house. Nutella sandwiches are amazing, but when grandma makes them, omg...", "This is a ridiculous take. If it\u2019s not your home, then you aren\u2019t entitled to tell the people in it how and where things *should* be done. You can save that for *your* home. If you have specific requirements for the way your free childcare is provided, then you may *ask* the person who is graciously volunteering their home for the purpose.", "Once my sister and I had a sleepover with our friends and when my dad got off work in the morning (night shift) he brought a bag of arby\u2019s sandwich for us. I\u2019m 30 and we all still talk about how awesome it was to get surprise sandwiches after being up all night binging movies. Random little treats have a way of sticking with you.", "OMG! OMG!  OMG!  With a bowl of buttered popcorn and a glass of Kool-Ade!", "My grandpa always made pancakes every Sunday. They were always so small and you had to eat about 10 to get one pancake. We loved it!! My dad also used to make pancakes every Sunday. He still does, but only if we\u2019re there for the weekend. Sundays at his house are always Pancake Day!!", "u/ZesteAccount477 is a bot."]}
