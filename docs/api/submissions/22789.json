If he wants to control how they eat he either should have stayed home or taken them with him", "To be honest, if I went on a Caribbean cruise for two weeks and I came home and found my kids happy, well fed and cared for and my\nInstructions had been adhered to, I would be thanking you profusely and handing you an envelope with some cash to spend as you saw fit for your efforts. \n\nTwo weeks of eating meals on the couch is not something that is going to seriously impact the rest of their lives and I\u2019d be smart to see it that way. \n\nYour bother isn\u2019t so smart. He should be more like me. :)\n\nNTA.", "NTA - at all. TBH pretty ballsy move on his part not to just let that one go when he's getting 2 weeks free babysitting.", "The world is a different place and \"the rules\" aren't set in stone anymore.  The kids are getting fed, you did your job.\n \nTell your brother he mispronounced \"Thank You.\" \n \nHe's probably just mad because you're The Cool Aunt or Uncle.", "NTA - personally I don\u2019t let my kids eat on the couch either but you know what, if someone took my kids so I could go on a holiday child free, they could let my kids eat off the floor and I wouldn\u2019t complain about it lol", "Hmmm most parents don\u2019t have a sibling that would be willing to watch their two kids for two weeks. NTA. Brother needs to be thankful and go have some Bahamas mommas", "NTA... they can't expect you to know their preferences about everything. Ggz what a little thing. They should be thanking you for years to come for watching the kids so they could have a vacation.  They are focusing on entirely the wrong things.  They need to be reminded that if they need/want you to help in the future, they need to zip it.  \nPlus this should have been a little vacation for your nieces from their parents where aunts get to spoil them and do fun stuff with them!", "NTA , dear. Your brother sounds like he has selected the smallest, most unimportant thing to be upset about. Meanwhile, there are 100 things to be happy about and thankful for. Such as the fact that you took wonderful care of his children, kept them safe and fed, spent time with them, and you wanted to make it fun, so you let them eat on the couch, who cares? I know one person who shouldn\u2019t care. Your brother. \n\nAlso, why is the SIL not speaking up and defending your decision? Is it actually your brother, or is it your SIL that is actually upset about the couch eating and she pushed him to say something? \n\nI just don\u2019t get the ungrateful spirit of parents sometimes when those of us who don\u2019t have children decide to take time out of our lives to help them. Or when someone who already has children takes on your children as well, just to help! No appreciation anymore these days. Goodness gracious", "NTA. If dinner around the dinner table is so important to your brother, then he should\u2019ve said something prior to the fact. I just can\u2019t imagine being so hung up on couchdinner after getting two free weeks of childcare. Seriously, you did your brother a massive favor, and he\u2019s probably just jealous because you got to be the cool aunt. Next time he hits you up for free childcare, you should let them watch R rated movies and let them stay up past their bedtimes. You\u2019re not the asshole, and anybody nitpicking their free childcare providers should sit and spin.", "NTA\n\nWhats the difference between a couch and a table? lol", "NTA.\n\nWhile most of my childhood dinners were eaten at the table, we had \u201cpicnic\u201d dinners around the coffee table watching tv if there was something on that the family wanted to watch, or if it was a birthday or something else special.\n\nTell your brother that the only AHs are him and his wife, and they are twice over. Once for being upset that their kids at while watching tv on the couch, and secondly for going away for 2 weeks on a cruise without their kids.\n\nFfs they chose to be parents, that is a minimum 18 year commitment of being a FAMILY, and a family doesn\u2019t have the parents go away for 2 weeks while the kids are barely teenagers.", "NTA\n\nKids know that rules are different with different carers.\n\nAnd if your brother wanted you to follow particular instructions, he needed to leave those particular instructions for you to follow.\n\nNow you know to decline next time you\u2019re asked to care for them. \u201cSorry, bro. Wouldn\u2019t want to scar them for life by not following instructions I wasn\u2019t given.\u201d", "NTA\n\nIf brother had specific requests, he should have discussed them with you instead of being ungrateful to someone willing to watch their kids for TWO weeks.  He's an asshole.", "NTA. If someone is babysitting your kids so you can go on a cruise, you can deal with the (perfectly harmless) choices they make. You followed the instructions they left, and improvised a little in other areas. Your nieces are well and truly old enough to understand - and take full advantage of! - the fact that aunts/uncles often bend or ignore certain parental preferences.", "NTA I get it not EVERYONE will appreciate it but the majority of people I know eat in the living room, yeah you could\u2019ve asked but he also could\u2019ve told you if he was against it", "NTA - in our household it's exclusively in front of the TV watching something the entire family can watch together. It's fun. I don't see the point of a dining table & chairs", "NTA\n\nThat was, and still is, the rule. When they stay with their Uncle/Aunt then they don't have to follow that rule. They're old enough to be aware that different rules apply in different places.", "Nah, you're not the asshole for letting your nieces eat dinner on the couch. Your brother didn't mention anything about it, so it's understandable that you thought it would be okay. It's not a big deal and can be easily resolved through communication. NTA.", "NTA. Growing up we ate in front of the tv and once a week we ate at the table. Every family is different. He is majorly overreacting. It\u2019s not like you instilled a habit that he has to work hard to break like staying up till 2am or something. It\u2019s just eating in a different room.", "NTA. My parents always insisted on the whole family at the table thing. My grandparents, who I spent a lot of time with, had TV trays in the living room. The table was specifically for holidays. With my kids, it's been whenever and wherever we had the opportunity, usually the living room. Though with the youngest's activities, it was normal to snarf something down in the car on the go or at the ball field. These days, we chill in the living room. We have a small house and no space for a table.", "NTA.\n\nYou watched your nieces for two weeks while your bro and sis-in-law had a wonderful vacation. You followed their rules. \n\nSo your nieces got to have some fun time, too. If that was such a big rule, brother could have stipulated that. The girls are old enough to understand that eating on the couch is something that is special only when staying with you, and doesn't happen on the regular. \n\nA simple \"thanks so much for watching the girls\" would have sufficed. Your brother can chill. A good time was had by all.", "It's your couch. You choose what is appropriate. At 12 and 13 they are old enough to understand that rules at your house can be different from rules at theirs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And even if you had known they usually eat at the dining table, the kids deserve a treat too on their vacation.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nYou took care of two teens for 2 weeks...am guessing for free.\n\nAnd your brother is upset you fed his kids, for free, on your couch?\n\nSomething seems wildly amiss with your brother. But easy way to fix it and not keep the kiddos anymore. \n\nIt's totally fine to eat anywhere you choose. I mean...your house. Your food.", "NTA let the kids beeee", "I grew up eating on the couch a lot, it's not unusual. NTA", "NTA\nThey're not toddlers. At their ages, I'd expect them to eat neatly and tidy up after themselves.\nDid they? Is there a mess left behind? Or is your brother mad because you or the kids mentioned it?\nYou did nothing wrong. You followed the directions you were given.", "Your couch, your rules NTA", "NTA\n\nHe should be grateful you looked after their children for 2 weeks.\n\nThey should have told you if it was a rule.", "At 12 and 13 your nieces should have known the rule, which is a very common rule for parents to have for their children. Dining room tables are the place for eating. \nObviously you are not a parent but honestly I thought that was common sense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sheesh.\n\nNTA.", "This was not a good idea. He said not alot of screen time plus you let them eat dinner in front of a TV every night. Now parents come home and what do you think the girls are going to want to do at dinner time?", "NTA and tell your brother that as you're soooooo bad at babysitting then it's probably best if you never babysit for him again.", "I don\u2019t let my kids eat on the couch but if one of my siblings watched my kids for two weeks I wouldn\u2019t care. There are home rules and there are fun different rules for other homes. I wouldn\u2019t have even said they had to keep to a bed time, I would say when I put them to bed but if the person watching them wanted a different time then they would be free to do so.

Kids are 12 and 13, I would think they are mature enough not to smear food in the furniture. If the parents are on vacay, The kids should get some kind of break from everyday rules. No harm done.", "NTA did mom and dad eat dinner following all the normal rules while they were on vacation? If the kids are old enough to spend 2 weeks with someone who doesn't know their routines backwards and forwards, they are also old enough to do something a bit differently and then get back into their routines after. Dad is annoyed that the kids are now whining about how much more fun your house is and why can't they do it that way at home. If it wasn't eating on the couch, it would be something else. If dad can get his own head around going on vacation and then getting back to his regular life and job after, he can teach his kids the same thing - rules are different in different houses and everyday rules are different than 2 weeks every once in a while rules.", "Easy NTA, even if he'd forbade eating on the couch, as an aunt or uncle, you don't have to obey, you can disregard that stuff. Same as grandparents, if told \"the kids can't have ice cream for breakfast\" or whatever, you can ignore it.", "The kids will probably always remember eating on the couch\u2026 as a treat at their fun aunt\u2019s/uncle\u2019s house. A special memory.", "This! Your brother sounds ungrateful, he just went away for two weeks, his kids are happy, healthy and being taken care of, so nothing to complain about in my opinion. NTA", ".......which I hope is his LAST two (or Amy) free weeks of babysitting", "I'm with you on that one. \nIf I got two weeks vacation time, kids free. \nKnock yourself out. As long as they get food, then I won't say a word about where the food was served.\n\nBesides, the kids should be old enough to know the difference between \"fun aunt\" rules and \"at home\" rules.", "Exactly! The kids probably thoroughly enjoyed the chance to do things differently for a change, but they know that their parents\u2019 expectations haven\u2019t altered.", "It\u2019s not common sense.

Though supper we mostly ate at the table", "I can't remember a single instance where I ate at the table with my parents in our home.", "It is common sense that the dining room table is where you eat. And unless you are a stranger to the family you would know whether or not they eat at the table", "Well I am 39 and I have never met a family that didn\u2019t eat at the dining room table", "Yea I was raised by a single mom who worked nights 7p-7a.  I ate at the table twice a year, thanksgiving and Christmas.", "Now you have met many.", "we\u2019ll just because you haven\u2019t and don\u2019t, doesn\u2019t mean it should be \u201ccommon sense\u201d. some kids (i was one of them) are allowed to eat where they want and that\u2019s their family dynamic.", "Pretty bold of you to assume everyone has a dining room or a dining room table"]}
