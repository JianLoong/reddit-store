NTA", "Nta, that's ridiculous", "When you let your kids stay with other people you have to accept their rules, or you have to hire someone. And kids (even much younger) now the difference. When my kid was little I wouldn't give him sweets, but I knew a few others did - and I was OK with it. He would get the small amount of sweets I was OK with, and we didn't have discussions about the \"no sweets from mama\" rule. Or when he stayed with his \"reserve grandparents\" I knew he would be allowed to watch television, even quite late - same. For him that made him like going there (and not feeling abandoned), and he still knew there was no way he could do it at home. So, NTA.", "NTA My parents didnt let us eat on the couch when we were little, but the rules became more relaxed once we got to the middle school years. If it was that big of a deal, he should\u2019ve said something. And what does he care anyway? It was *your* couch! How about thanks for babysitting for 2 weeks, sis? Sheesh.", "I don\u2019t understand the problem. You took wonderful care of them.

Your \"bother\" seems quite aptly named.", "Right if he didn't want them to eat on the couch then he should have said that.

I think it's very common in that situation for the relative to come stay at the kids' house to not interrupt their routine. That's how it worked with us. The OP probably doesn't have two extra bedrooms for little girls to stay in.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think it changes anything. The OP followed the rules they were given. The unknown rule they broke is minor in the big picture and caused no long term harm and certainly wasn't overwhelmingly obvious without being specified. It's not like \"Don't lock the kids out over night.\" I'm curious if the rule is about keeping the couch clean or about the family eating together aspect. During those two weeks, \"the family\" wasn't together. It was a temporary change in routine for everyone.", "Here's the thing. Nowhere does it say the children stayed with her. It says she agreed to take care of them. Likely, she stayed at their house and they slept in their own beds.\n\nBut I don't think that changes much. The OP was in charge and followed the instructions she was given.\n\nI'm curious if the parents are upset because they thought the couch might get messy or it's strictly because of the idea of it being \"wrong\" in principle.", "In a twist of fate, my kids eat at the dining room table while DH and I eat in the living room watching TV.  They don\u2019t want to watch what we do, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nThis is such a ridiculously condescending comment.

Guess who's been eating on the couch, and enjoying every sinful minute of it.", "Not who you asked, but I can give an answer. My couch is fabric and can be washed,  but I don't really want to have to deal with washing the whole thing more often than necessary, not only is it a good amount of work but it also increases the wear and tear on the couch. As such, my kids are only allowed to eat on the couch on occasion, and when the meal isn't something that would leave a stain. It's a treat, and they enjoy the heck out of it when allowed.", "I had an aunt like that when I was young and when I was a teenager she was the \"safe\" aunt to tell what I'd been up to. I know she told my mum everything but as long as my mum knew what I was up to she didn't bring it up.

That said, if you\u2019re clear in advance on what is available for consumption at your place then anyone leaving their kids with you is agreeing to it.\n\nIf anyone came to my place and insisted that all meals had to be eaten at the table, then they\u2019re expecting me to clear off the table for them. My furniture, my uses. And presumably OP prefers to eat on the couch themselves so the brother was wanting a behavioural change from OP.", "Well yes, exactly. The parents could have just covered that with the kids by saying there are different rules at uncle x's house. Stupid and very ungrateful to complain about it tbh", "My daughter spends Fridays with my mother in law, and she always likes to have breakfast there, because at grandma's house they follow grandma's rules, and grandma gives her Nutella sandwiches.", "My MIL follows same logic and secretly gives my son cows milk because he likes it, even though he is not allowed it, as it gives him really bad eczema.

Now I try hard to give my son better habits and he drinks water only and we really normalize the sweets but also keep it in moderation, still some relatives try play the cool uncle. Please stop thinking it makes you cool, it puts you on same level of maturity as a child you\u2019re minding. Maybe some parents don\u2019t want to deal with giving their child dentist trauma by pulling rotten milk teeth or deal with allergy eczema and your efforts to be cool are just infantile and shows plain lack of thoughtfulness.", "I agree but disagree. \n\nMy house has different expectations than their house, but I don\u2019t mess with a kid\u2019s diet. \n\nMy nieces and nephews are allowed/ not allowed things for specific reasons, and I am not going against their parents for that.

I always follow dietary restrictions that have a reason (food allergies) but the soda, for example, is something my niece only was allowed as a treat, and coming to my house *is* a treat.

Please get a grip.", "She didn't say the kids were eating the couch. She said they were eating on it.
