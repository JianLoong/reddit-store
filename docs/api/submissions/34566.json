This summer he was starting to go blind from diabetes so I drove out and spent a few months rounding up his cattle and cutting his hay to get sold. When the work was done he said he wanted to sell my wife and I the ranch. He named his price, which was certainly under market, but would provide well for him and his wife until they passed. We agreed and had attorneys draw up the purchase agreement, had land surveys done, legal, etc. Everything was signed and set to close. The day prior to closing FIL was served with divorce papers, halting the sale. MIL stated that she wanted to make sure she got her fair share out of the deal and getting a divorce was the only way she would be legally entitled to half. \n\nA few days after getting served FIL has a heart attack, and died in the ICU about a month after.   My wife and I dug the hole with a backhoe , bought him a casket, and put him to rest yesterday. Mother in law didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the burial, neither did his other daughter. \n\nToday, I stopped in to say goodbye to MIL before my wife and I started the two day drive home. She asked what needed to be done to cancel the land purchase agreement, to which I told her that we still intend to proceed, that all of the money would now go to her alone. She said that we weren\u2019t paying enough for the land and she wanted us to cancel the agreement. \n\nWe said no, we had a deal with FIL that we would buy the land, and provide for them, and also promised to keep the ranch whole as long as we could. This didn\u2019t end well; she accused us of stealing her inheritance, going behind her back, screwing her over, etc. It got to the point where I just had to say I\u2019m sorry, I love you, but I have to get back home. \n\nSo, I plan on enforcing the purchase as agreed with my father in law, despite my mother in laws wishes. I feel guilty as fuck.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  We are not concerned about the legal side of things; we had 3 lawyers work on the PA to make sure it was legit (ours, his, and a neutral 3rd party draftsmen). The agreement is valid and executable. Im just wondering if IATA for enforcing the agreement against MIL\u2019s wishes after FIL passed away.

His last wish as it turns out.

She's only throwing up a fuss because she wants more money and reckons she can guilt you into paying it. Do not. This isn't her 'inheritance'.

Likely would not have happened if the genders were reversed.  This sub can be fun sometimes.", "When my wife's parents got divorced, it was because my wife's mom had somebody whispering in her ear that she could get so much out of my FIL if she left him.

As a good son in law is it not your duty. Sounds like he understood fully what he was doing for the 1 daughter that love him, dont know why you're even bothered about the women who didnt care enough about your Fil to even attend his funeral.

It's just not priced at an arm's length deal price, which isn't a problem per se because it isn't an arm's length deal.\n\nShe is being screwed by you only if she knew that he'd die before the sale and counted on getting more than she would have received in the divorce. If she's really pushing for more, that is kinda suspicious. \n\nDivorce & death don't always bring out the best in people. I think it's OK to conclude that the existing deal is a rational & equitable deal when not viewed through the \"I'm getting mine!\" lens of the divorce & probate. \n\nBUT. If you want her to remain within the family (not go LC or NC), you might consider ways you could round up. Being creative in an expand-the-pie & build relationships sense will give the best resolution here and you'll have far more details than I can guess. Might be worth brainstorming with your wife, not with MIL because you don't want to acknowledge and feed her idea that she's getting a raw deal. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let the leeches win.", "NTA - she was going to divorce him to make sure she got \"her fair share\".  Now get 100% of what she would only have had 50% of.  She can go kick rocks.  Stop feeling guilty.", "NTA.\n\nSalt those Snails.", "I don't understand how you think you can force a sale with someone who died. The deal died with your FIL.

It was a shitty move to serve divorce papers like that. Now, it was/is possible there were issues behind the scenes y'all didn't know about, but those are now fully moot due to FIL's passing.\n\nExecute the sale as is, deliver whatever funds are due MIL, and feel no guilt or remorse here. MIL's wishes are trash based on her behavior before FIL's death.", "NTA.  She agreed to this before hand.  If she had concerns about the price, then that should have been brought up before she agreed to the purchase.", "From what I've gathered, the property was an inheritance of FIL. Generally an inheritance only belongs to the spouse who inherited it, it's not considered communal property. Even if MIL is to inherit the property, she doesn't get it right away, it has to go through probate first. Until then it belongs to the estate. NAL, but I believe since the contract was already drawn up and signed it's basically a done deal. It would basically be like a debt owed by the estate.", "She probably wants to sell it to others for more money", "she may have divorced him because he ran her into debt... there seems to be a lot more to this story - this guy paid off the debt and took the farm as a trade.  If she had her names on the deed, this may become a problem", "Would be a wonderful thing if her starting the divorce proceedings would disqualify a spouse from estate, you wanted out of the relationship you shouldn't profit out benefit from their death before it was finished.\n\nDid Dad get an autopsy at all, cause the sceptic in me thinks a lady willing to divorce a failing health man could totally slip him something to trigger a heart attack or mimic it well enough with his other health issues.", "It\u2019s amazing what a Judge can do.  If she gets up and says FIL was having mental problems from an undiagnosed heart condition-  she maybe able to void the sale. \n\nTalk to a lawyer and follow the advise. \n\nI would think getting her to accept a payment would be a good start, but again a lawyer.", "But the sale was agreed before the divorce papers were served. So would that still count? Wouldn't the burden of proof be on MIL to show that FIL knew he was about to get served and hence was trying to screw her over", "This is what trusts are for.", "Since it\u2019s YOUR money would the ranch stay in your wife\u2019s family at all or would you home sole ownership?", "There's your answer.\nIf it's NWPA Lmk. Nice lake up here", "He was diabetic. I wonder about his insulin levels. My husband accidentally gave himself an overdose of a fast acting insulin when he blood sugar was already low. Fortunately, he realized it right away and we have a hospital 5 minutes away. He was kept in hospital for close to a week. Insulin is easy to manipulate.", "Again, UK law not US, but if the proposed undervalue transfer is that close to the date, the assumption would be that it\u2019s the reason for the transfer.

Narrators can be unreliable.", "Based on OP, the land being sold was inherited by FIL from his family.  \n\nIn most US states and jurisdictions abroad I know of, that wouldn't be considered marital property so long as there was no comingling of spousal/marital funds.    \n  \nEven in some community property states like California(Knew of a similar type property dispute in a divorce case in California which judge ruled is excluded from marital property as it was inherited from one of the spouse's family and no comingling of marital/other spousal funds occurred.  \n\nAbsent the latter, if the post is as stated, MIL has absolutely no say as FIL's inherited property remains his sole property separate from marital assets.  FIL would have absolute say in selling the house even under market price.", "I really wish they'd ban \"if they reversed the sexes\" posts.", "I wish the different treatment/attitudes weren't a thing, on this sub in particular and in general, but here we are.", "You know how many times \"if the genders were reversed or if it were a man\" gets top comment. Too often for it to be some hard and fast rule that women are treated way better.\n\nIt really depends on the crowd who finds the post. I've seen some men get torched unnecessary but I've seen at least as many women get torched as well.
