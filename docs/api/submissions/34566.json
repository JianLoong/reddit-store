{"id": 34566, "submission_id": "191aa9u", "title": "AITA for carrying through purchasing land from my FIL after he died and MIL is the estate?", "selftext": "My father in law owned a large ranch that has been in his family for a few generations. This summer he was starting to go blind from diabetes so I drove out and spent a few months rounding up his cattle and cutting his hay to get sold. When the work was done he said he wanted to sell my wife and I the ranch. He named his price, which was certainly under market, but would provide well for him and his wife until they passed. We agreed and had attorneys draw up the purchase agreement, had land surveys done, legal, etc. Everything was signed and set to close. The day prior to closing FIL was served with divorce papers, halting the sale. MIL stated that she wanted to make sure she got her fair share out of the deal and getting a divorce was the only way she would be legally entitled to half. \n\nA few days after getting served FIL has a heart attack, and died in the ICU about a month after.   My wife and I dug the hole with a backhoe , bought him a casket, and put him to rest yesterday. Mother in law didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the burial, neither did his other daughter. \n\nToday, I stopped in to say goodbye to MIL before my wife and I started the two day drive home. She asked what needed to be done to cancel the land purchase agreement, to which I told her that we still intend to proceed, that all of the money would now go to her alone. She said that we weren\u2019t paying enough for the land and she wanted us to cancel the agreement. \n\nWe said no, we had a deal with FIL that we would buy the land, and provide for them, and also promised to keep the ranch whole as long as we could. This didn\u2019t end well; she accused us of stealing her inheritance, going behind her back, screwing her over, etc. It got to the point where I just had to say I\u2019m sorry, I love you, but I have to get back home. \n\nSo, I plan on enforcing the purchase as agreed with my father in law, despite my mother in laws wishes. I feel guilty as fuck.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  We are not concerned about the legal side of things; we had 3 lawyers work on the PA to make sure it was legit (ours, his, and a neutral 3rd party draftsmen). The agreement is valid and executable. Im just wondering if IATA for enforcing the agreement against MIL\u2019s wishes after FIL passed away.

Carry it out. \n\nMIL isn't the estate, she's beneficiary to the estate. She doesn't get to make decisions for the estate (unless she's the executor). \n\nObviously there's a lot of legal that needs to be considered, but this isn't that sub", "**NTA**\n\nShe's a nasty woman who didn't hesitate to up the stress on her dying husband.   You have a legal agreement, tell you lawyer you want to proceed.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd definitely consult a lawyer. If the seller passed before the closing, it may not still be a valid deal.", "What is your wife\u2019s opinion?  I\u2019m assuming she is their daughter - so her opinion on this should not only matter but probably take precedence over yours. If you are both in agreement- GREAT.  Otherwise I think it would be an unfortunate decision on your part to drag her into a protracted legal battle with her mother. \n\nWhile your post was not clear on this point - if we are dealing with a STEPmother, then I assume you and your wife are likely to be on the same page already. \n\nBut get some good legal advice since the legal fees might severely dilute the expected value of this deal to you and your wife.", "I hope you get it. Don\u2019t feel guilty about it. It\u2019s what he wanted. Sound like she married him for the wrong reason", "If nothing got recorded before he passed, the whole probate process needs to be finalized now before the sale can be resolved. NTA for wanting to continue with the sale, but depending on FIL\u2019s will and the probate laws in your state, you may not be able to purchase the property at the same terms you and he agreed to.", "Nta. Cut her off once done. She sounds like a greedy old hag.", "NAH\n\nInteresting to see how this plays out legally - post an update, in a few years, when the courts have settled it.\n\n  \nIf it were all legal and airtight, the divorce would not have halted it.", "NTA - You are following through on your FIL's wishes.  As long as the agreement is still valid (check with your lawyer) it is a nearly a done deal, just settling up at this point.  I trust this was property solely owned by FIL in that it was obviously was brought to the marriage.  And if so, he freely entered into the deal prior to his passing.  So, MIL has no claim at this point.  She will get a nice chunk of change anyway.  But prepare for a lot of drama on her part in probate I would think.  But a reasonable judge will see through her shenanigans.", "NTA. Good riddance she sounds awful.", "I\u2019m studying for the bar exam and this post was triggering. Also NTA.", "NTA but how do we know MIL didn't play a direct role in FIL's death...", "INFO: Why are you solely making all the decisions? You're married and these are your wife's parents. You haven't spent even one sentence of your OP considering her feelings on the matter or stating her opinion. Y T A for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
