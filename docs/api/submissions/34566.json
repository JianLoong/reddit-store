{"id": 34566, "submission_id": "191aa9u", "title": "AITA for carrying through purchasing land from my FIL after he died and MIL is the estate?", "selftext": "My father in law owned a large ranch that has been in his family for a few generations. This summer he was starting to go blind from diabetes so I drove out and spent a few months rounding up his cattle and cutting his hay to get sold. When the work was done he said he wanted to sell my wife and I the ranch. He named his price, which was certainly under market, but would provide well for him and his wife until they passed. We agreed and had attorneys draw up the purchase agreement, had land surveys done, legal, etc. Everything was signed and set to close. The day prior to closing FIL was served with divorce papers, halting the sale. MIL stated that she wanted to make sure she got her fair share out of the deal and getting a divorce was the only way she would be legally entitled to half. \n\nA few days after getting served FIL has a heart attack, and died in the ICU about a month after.   My wife and I dug the hole with a backhoe , bought him a casket, and put him to rest yesterday. Mother in law didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the burial, neither did his other daughter. \n\nToday, I stopped in to say goodbye to MIL before my wife and I started the two day drive home. She asked what needed to be done to cancel the land purchase agreement, to which I told her that we still intend to proceed, that all of the money would now go to her alone. She said that we weren\u2019t paying enough for the land and she wanted us to cancel the agreement. \n\nWe said no, we had a deal with FIL that we would buy the land, and provide for them, and also promised to keep the ranch whole as long as we could. This didn\u2019t end well; she accused us of stealing her inheritance, going behind her back, screwing her over, etc. It got to the point where I just had to say I\u2019m sorry, I love you, but I have to get back home. \n\nSo, I plan on enforcing the purchase as agreed with my father in law, despite my mother in laws wishes. I feel guilty as fuck.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  We are not concerned about the legal side of things; we had 3 lawyers work on the PA to make sure it was legit (ours, his, and a neutral 3rd party draftsmen). The agreement is valid and executable. Im just wondering if IATA for enforcing the agreement against MIL\u2019s wishes after FIL passed away.

Carry it out. \n\nMIL isn't the estate, she's beneficiary to the estate. She doesn't get to make decisions for the estate (unless she's the executor). \n\nObviously there's a lot of legal that needs to be considered, but this isn't that sub", "**NTA**\n\nShe's a nasty woman who didn't hesitate to up the stress on her dying husband.   You have a legal agreement, tell you lawyer you want to proceed.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd definitely consult a lawyer. If the seller passed before the closing, it may not still be a valid deal.", "What is your wife\u2019s opinion?  I\u2019m assuming she is their daughter - so her opinion on this should not only matter but probably take precedence over yours. If you are both in agreement- GREAT.  Otherwise I think it would be an unfortunate decision on your part to drag her into a protracted legal battle with her mother. \n\nWhile your post was not clear on this point - if we are dealing with a STEPmother, then I assume you and your wife are likely to be on the same page already. \n\nBut get some good legal advice since the legal fees might severely dilute the expected value of this deal to you and your wife.", "I hope you get it. Don\u2019t feel guilty about it. It\u2019s what he wanted. Sound like she married him for the wrong reason", "If nothing got recorded before he passed, the whole probate process needs to be finalized now before the sale can be resolved. NTA for wanting to continue with the sale, but depending on FIL\u2019s will and the probate laws in your state, you may not be able to purchase the property at the same terms you and he agreed to.", "Nta. Cut her off once done. She sounds like a greedy old hag.", "NAH\n\nInteresting to see how this plays out legally - post an update, in a few years, when the courts have settled it.\n\n  \nIf it were all legal and airtight, the divorce would not have halted it.", "NTA - You are following through on your FIL's wishes.  As long as the agreement is still valid (check with your lawyer) it is a nearly a done deal, just settling up at this point.  I trust this was property solely owned by FIL in that it was obviously was brought to the marriage.  And if so, he freely entered into the deal prior to his passing.  So, MIL has no claim at this point.  She will get a nice chunk of change anyway.  But prepare for a lot of drama on her part in probate I would think.  But a reasonable judge will see through her shenanigans.", "NTA. Good riddance she sounds awful.", "I\u2019m studying for the bar exam and this post was triggering. Also NTA.", "NTA but how do we know MIL didn't play a direct role in FIL's death...", "INFO: Why are you solely making all the decisions? You're married and these are your wife's parents.

She did and nothing was ever the same,", "And she may not be in control of anything.", "It wasn't a handshake deal.  It was a legal agreement with papers signed and lawyers involved.", "My wife wants to go scorched earth on her mother. I\u2019m trying to be voice of reason and find a solution to the problem. The reason I\u2019m making the decisions is because Its my money and I\u2019m not emotionally involved to the degree that she is. I\u2019m trying to do what is best for everyone, as has always been my intent.", "Which means the executor (or administrator) will have to justify not following though.   I will probably take some additional time but the fact that the papers were already signed by the FIL would mean that whoever it is would be obligated to complete the sale.  The MIL gets whatever the will or state grants her, she can't change the terms.", "Whoah! Theres a lot more to this story based on previous posts !!! FIL. Was deep in debt and had to sell to not lose the farm \n\nThis changes a lot of things , I think.  \n\nPossibly an edit to show the full story? I see you\u2019re going to rent out the grazing land and that you were the last person that could save the farm \n\nMil\u2019s feelings may be pretty valid here if she was not part of the \u201cold man\u201d your words debt \n\nIf the money is purely going to pay off his debts , she is left homeless and without a penny", "NTA - Your FIL is dead after your MIL pulled a nasty, vicious stunt to get her hands on money from a ranch that was inherited through her husband's family, even though your FIL had ensured that she would be provided for. Then she can't even arrange or even attend his burial and is now demanding even more money.\n\nWhy on earth are you spending even a second on this woman's feelings, she sure as hell doesn't seem to care what her actions did to her husband - or the pain it must be causing your wife. Her daughter. I mean, if I were in your wife's position I would never speak to my mother again, for costing me time with my father and I would be going scorched earth on her, using lawyers and any other means to get her out of my life for good. let alone waste a second of my time worrying about her greed.\n\nYou are fulfilling your FIL's wishes. His last wish as it turns out. The ranch will remain in his family and your MIL will have enough resources to live securely - if there was enough for two to live well on, then there is more than enough for one. If that isn't enough for her, then she can always see about securing employment.", "NTA. If lawyers say the sale can go ahead, you should. MIL sounds like a peach\u2026", "NTA.\nNope. MIL doesn't get to make those sorts of demands. You have a legal, executable contract that should go through. She's only throwing up a fuss because she wants more money and reckons she can guilt you into paying it. Do not. This isn't her 'inheritance'. Her inheritance is the money she'll gain *after* the sale. Her whole attitude here just screams as her making grabby hands at other people's money and it isn't sitting well with me *at all*. You'd be foolish to give in to her demands.", "Do it", "Why do you feel bad for this woman? Nta obviously.", "Apparently it is also HER ranch, or did you forget that? He was an asshole for not consulting his life partner and dependig on which state this is, she would have had to agreed to teh deal to make it binding.", "So your wife's mother was so upset about her husband selling the land under value that she was prepared to divorce him over it and let's be honest it probably contributed heavily to his heart attack and you are still going to try to push the sale through? \n\nEven if the contract is signed it doesn't sound like there was a meeting of the minds and without a meeting of minds a contract can be invalidated. Additionally, as you acknowledge the land is being sold under value most consideration will be given to your MiL. I wouldn't be so sure this one won't be ripped up.", "NTA\n\nMIL is. a nasty, greedy person.  After this is all over, there will come a time when MIL wants some kind of help or favor.  Remember then that she doesn't deserve your help.", "NTA\n\nHer motivation is either greed or insecurity. She can't run the place herself which would be required for her to put it on the market for a higher price. The land and animals' welfare may deteriorate while she is trying to get more money. If her desire was more money, she may even frivolously spend the money leaving zero inheritance and your FIL's legacy will be a faded memory.", "NTA", "NTA. If possible have an audit done on the estate to make sure the MIL wasn\u2019t stealing from it.", "NTA. You are honoring FIL's wishes. \n\nMy sincere condolences on your loss.", "What does your wife want to do? I assume she is in the same page. You don\u2019t want to push on if it going to destroy her relationship with her mother do you? However if she is good to go then go for it. Also, should you choose to pull out make sure MIL knows that you will not be making another offer.  It sure how the market is for this type of property where you are but large property can take years to got another buyer where I live.", "Was MIL an owner of the ranch?", "Nta. But I don't understand how, if fil passed before the actual sale, how mil is not now the sole owner. Does she not have the right to cancel the sale, or was what he signed to you binding somehow? And how could he have signed an agreement with you in the first place, if she wasn't happy with the terms? Wasn't she then half-owner?", "In the UK, if someone who was having marital difficulties arranged a sale of a family asset to a family member at an undervalue, that could be considered an attempt to deprive himself of assets, so they wouldn\u2019t be considered in the divorce and any settlement would be lower. Maybe it was something like that?", "Sounds like she contributed to his death", "That still isn't his problem if the contract is valid.  The fact that FIL was willing to make this sale, and the fact that she divorced him, may show how much those two really cared about each other.  As may the fact that DIL does not seem to care about MIL's well-being.  MIL may be getting all the consideration she has earned.", "The question isn't whether she played a direct role in his death, it's whether she intended to.\n\nHer actions undoubtedly contributed significantly to his heart attack.", "It had been in his family for generations. He likely got it also under market rate from his family. She no doubt wants to sell it to developers for a phat profit. Source: I saw almost the exact same scenario play out in my own family where the 5 generation family farm is now a suburb of 50 houses and one married in family member screwed everyone else blood related out of their share.", "> without a meeting of minds a contract can be invalidated\n\nThere was a meeting of minds with the land's owner.", "Maybe \u2026 maybe not \u2026 fact is there are a lot of missing pieces to this story .  Paid off the man\u2019s debt in exchange for the property", "But not with everyone who had a financial interest in the property. Now if the land was being sold for value that probably wouldn't matter, but it's not being sold for value. It's being sold well undervalue which robs the other party. \n\nWhen you don't pay market value there is always a lot more wiggle room in a contract for sale that doesn't exist if you meet the market price.", "Amazing how they didn't give you the benefit of the doubt and went at you with both barrels, huh?  Likely would not have happened if the genders were reversed.  This sub can be fun sometimes."]}
