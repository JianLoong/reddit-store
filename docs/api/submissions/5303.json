It\u2019s not right, and I don\u2019t think the household I was raised in was \u201cright\u201d but people do get raised with very different standards of behavior for these things and it can be tough, especially when you\u2019re used to quiet or the situation constantly wakes a sleeping baby or.. it just grosses you out.
