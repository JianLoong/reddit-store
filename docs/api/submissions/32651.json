{"id": 32651, "submission_id": "18dzqlj", "title": "AITA for confining kids at a party and not dogs?", "selftext": "As a sort of early Christmas party, I planned a large gathering for friends and family. A lot of us really love dogs, so I invited the pets as well. Since I've got a large area, we planned on having all the dogs off-leash so they can run around and play. \n\n  \nA few people voiced concerns beforehand because they wanted to bring their young kids to the Christmas party, didn't want large dogs to be running around, and wanted them all on leashes, or not allowed. I told them if they don't like it, they don't have to come. They said they don't want to leave their kid behind because it looks like a lot of fun and it's a rare chance for them to meet a bunch of friends and family in one place. (No one else is planning a gathering as large as this one). I reiterated that the party is primarily dog-friendly, it is not kid-friendly, and there would be multiple dogs running around. They said they understood.\n\n  \nThey did not understand. They arrived and were unhappy. I had a bunch of Christmas decorations up, a few photo spots set up, a bunch of dog toys and balls, and custom and clearly labeled dog treats laid out as well. Their main complaint was that I confined the children, and not the dogs. They feel like it should've been the other way around. \n\nI had one small area that the dogs couldn't get into. They didn't like that multiple very energetic large dogs were running around with abandon, and no attempt was made to stop them from running or put them on a leash, even after one kid was nearly knocked over. I told them to go and watch their kid in the one designed dog-free area if they didn't like that. They were unhappy because it separated them from the other adults and activities. They also didn't like that I didn't let them just dump their kid there and walk off - they had to stay and actually watch their children. I also did not have anything in there that would entertain a child. \n\nOther things they were unhappy about:\n\n* I had super cute dog treats (think cupcakes, mini donuts, etc all clearly labeled) and nothing for children. I had normal food for humans. They were upset I didn't have \"kid\" food, like dinosaur nuggets. \n* A couple kids threw tantrums when I wouldn't let them eat the dog treats. Apparently that's my fault for having dog treats that look like desserts. \n* They were upset I had dog toys, but not toys for children. \n* They were upset I refused to tell everyone to leash their dogs so they could go over to a photospot and take pictures of their kid.\n  \nNow I'm being accused of being an asshole since I didn't consider how Christmas is a \"kid's holiday\", or for \"families\" since I'm more concerned about the dogs and adults having a good time than children having a good time. They insist that since it's Christmas I HAVE to have kids things going on. Dogs are family.\n\n  \nAITA for planning a Christmas party for adults and dogs, and making absolutely no attempt to make it  kid-friendly?", "created_utc": 1702077998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dzqlj/aita_for_confining_kids_at_a_party_and_not_dogs/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
