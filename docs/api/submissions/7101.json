That's like saying all those niceguy incels are owed a girlfriend because oh boy they sure do have feelings for women.\n\nBut you've only been together 4 months. If you don't like the way she picked you then break up.\n\nHonestly, you did ask how she picked you so. YTA.", "YTA. Her 70% or more score is a standard. She has standards and she\u2019s not an asshole for having them or only dating people who meet her standards.\n\nShe obviously likes data and math and she uses that in her life to organise things. That\u2019s not a bad thing and it doesn\u2019t imply she can\u2019t love.", "YTA. I guess the next thing she should add to her rubric is \"doesn't hate math.\"", "YTA, and don't ask questions to which you don't want the answers. \n\nBTW, your girlfriend's approach is brilliant. Lust fades, but kindness, compatibility, shared values, and the like are what make a relationship last.", "I think you\u2019re missing the point. You passed my guy! That means she sees real promise with you. That\u2019s a good thing. That would have been my takeaway.", "YTA. This is what your GF heard. You are cold, you can't love me. This is what she said. I chose you. I love you. You are everything on my list. Not everyone falls into this preset idea of what love is.", "YTA. Not everyone approaches relationships the same. Her background definitely has an impact on how she views transactions, including emotional ones. Who are you to judge?", "YTA and sounds like you're not compatible and I'm thinking your percentage has probably gone down now", "YTA. A relationship is more than just feelings if you want anything long term. Saying \"I love you\" every morning doesn't pay the mortgage, clean the house, or fix a leaky faucet. She seems to understand that. I am pretty analytical myself so I understand her point of view, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for feelings.", "YTA - she told you you were special in her love language and you corrected her. she may be unique in her method but you demonstrate you don't deserve that score", "YTA, I think her rubric thing is a little silly, but ultimately it's a way for her to make herself feel safe in her choice. If she gave you good \"scores\" in the various categories -- I'm guessing they were things like looks, intelligence, manners, work ethic, etc -- that means she likes you, it's just a different way of saying that. And if she chose you over three other guys, it means she likes you a lot. So you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot.", "Guess who just dropped below 70%?

Don't ask a question you are not prepared to hear an honest answer for.", "Feelings are fleeting. They change with the day, the weather, and what kind of day you had. A romance or relationship based entirely on feelings is bound to either fail or fade into resentment. She's right about that. Frankly, I don't know why you're not flattered. She didn't pick you because she had some feeling in her chest that will fade and change within a few months. She clearly thought long and hard about it, considering it from multiple angles, and decided you were the best choice and fit for her, above the others she was deciding from. If you think that means she doesn't feel any emotion towards you at all, you're an idiot. YTA.", "YTA.  She's revising that rubric as you speak.  \n\nSurvey says: that's not good for you!", "YTA\n\nSure, it's a bit weird that she actually creates *a score* to express how she views a person she might be dating, but you say 'incapable of love'?\n\nMeanwhile, you are also looking for attributes above a certain threshhold and cannot believe you \"have\" (perhaps not for long) her. Which..   what? You don't give it a numerical score so it's not the same thing? How is that?", "YTA. You wanted reassurance that you were in some way special and that she has strong feelings for you, rather than recognizing that you're special for meeting her very rigorous standards and that the relationship is more likely to be successful because she prescreened y'all for compatibility upfront. When you didn't get what you wanted, you name called and dismissed your gf's feelings. You're going to lose her if you can't acknowledge your differences without resulting to ugly behavior.", "YTA. She wouldn't date you if she didn't like you. She's right to look at more than just feelings because feelings aren't everything and there's nothing wrong with having a set of standards that need to be met. \n\nI'm actually impressed by her strategy and with her being a data scientist, I would expect nothing less than a full analysis of the person, situation, etc.", "YTA for asking questions you clearly didn't want the answer to and just fishing for compliments.  That's a passive aggressive dick move and the hallmark of insecurity.  You probably lost a few points on the old rubric there.\n\nShe gave you a truthful answer (which works in your favor, btw) and now you're judging her for it and accusing her of being a way that clearly didn't seem to be an issue before she failed to kiss your \\*ss in your little fishing expedition there.  So double TA.\n\nDon't ask questions if you can't handle the answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.  What you see as cold and calculating, others see as self-respect.  Having standards is a good thing.  She just formalized it into a mathematical equation.", "YTA.\n\nMany people have lists of what they are looking for in a partner. The fact that she had one and is dating you says to me that she likes you and for anything on the list you where lacking it was less important than the things you brought to the table (both in personality and compatibility) \n\nIn response to her saying she is dumping all the other guys she was seeing to make you her leading guy you told her because she had a list that she was: cold, unfeeling, incapable of love. \n\nWhat mean things to say to someone who has picked you. Who chose you. Who wants you. Who cares if she thinks her friends could have done better? Do you somehow know all of her friends and the minutia of who they ended up with? Why does her knowing she doesn\u2019t like the men her friends ended up with bother you so much. Get over yourself.\n\nEdit: I have a list. Does that make me cold and unfeeling too? If it does you have to eliminate all of the women I know from your dating pool because they all have them too.", "Some people, like myself, have troubles with emotions and it takes analyzation and looking logically on emotions to figure out what is best for us, because we can't feel them ourselves. In her case, it sounds like she uses math to determine who she would date and get attached to.\n\nBut that might not even be the case, she's analyzing who would make a good husband. That's pretty wise of her in my opinion, because although romance is a big part, so is the total health and personality of the person, along with other factors.\n\nPoint is, you shouldn't call her heartless for having standards, that's responsible of her to do. I say she should make her standards higher, if the bar is really this low that she dates you.\n\nSo yeah. **YTA.**", "YTA. You\u2019ve only known this person for 4 months, you have no idea what they are or aren\u2019t capable of.", "YTA. Way to self sabotage.\n\nHave you heard of a self fulfilling prophecy? You don\u2019t feel good enough for someone so you act unkindly towards them, therefore confirming you\u2019re not good enough.\n\nWork on that. Perhaps through making a list?", "YTA\n\nFeelings should *absolutely* not be the only thing informing someone\u2019s decision about choosing a partner. Compatibility and having common goals is extremely important. If her brain works in a way that helps tabulate compatibility that way, it does not mean she\u2019s cold; it means she relies on logic more heavily than emotions, and that\u2019s okay. Love and attraction grow and wane and change constantly and the relationship should be strong enough able to weather all those phases.", "YTA - You should take it as a compliment that she thinks you fit into what she wants in a relationship.\n\nLike everyone, she's got her idea of what she's looking for in a partner, and she feels that you are ticking most, if not all, of those boxes.\n\nJust be happy", "YTA hate to break it to you but everyone has requirements and deal breakers. She explained it using math. Everyone does it. Why did you pick your girlfriend? She is beautiful. Plus. She is smart. Plus. Those were pluses in a favor no? You sound insecure.", "YTA. Don\u2019t pretend this is all about \u201cfeelings\u201d. You wanted for her to stoke your ego and tell you you were the hottest/sexiest/manliest/whateverest guy of the bunch so she picked you. Instead of that though, she said she thought about ALL of your characteristics and felt you\u2019d be most compatible with her. She\u2019s over here thinking about the big picture, wanting to commit, and all you care about is basic surface level crap. If you\u2019re not careful she\u2019s gonna use this as a data point to update her rubric.", "Eh, it's clear she sees things differently, and while it may seem cold to you and many others, me included, this isn't illogical. There are also different love languages, and it's clear she isn't as emotionally expressive as you, but in her way, she is saying she really likes you. As far as being capable of love, she may not be able to express it the same way as you, and this is something you have to decide if you can be okay with that.", "Yta. I hope she gave you an F grade and flunks you out of the relationship.", "YTA your girlfriend is a smart woman. She has standards and that\u2019s good. She knows what she wants in a man and that\u2019s good. So why are you so mad? At the end of the day she still choose you. Well i bet after that fight your score will be under 70%.", "YTA\n\nDon't look a fucking gift horse in the mouth.  You got her as your girlfriend, does it really matter how?\n\nI'm going to just tell you that it's actually a pretty brilliant idea.  She's not making you a number, but rather comparing qualities that she likes.  Would you rather the deciding factor be something you're not in control of, like say whomever has the cutest face or whoever is the tallest.  Those are deciding factors that some people use that really don't help.  Her factors actually do help her.  You checked the boxes and the others didn't.  Those boxes were you're actions and things about you that she likes, not just numbers.  She is a numbers kinda gal, so it makes sense to break it down so she can make a decision. \n\n>dating only based on feelings and not assessing the whole person is stupid. I don\u2019t agree feelings should be the only why to determine romance.\n\nShe is right.  Feelings get in the way and we get so blinded by our feelings that we make terrible choices for partners because we think our love is enough to change them.  Guess what?  It isn't.\n\n>That\u2019s pretty shitty of her to judge her friends like that\n\nShe's not judging her friends, she's choosing to learn from their mistakes.  They complain to her about all the trouble they have with their significant others.  She's privy to all the ups and downs.  She knows what mistakes they made and not to make them.\n\n>I just wanted to hear that I was special in some way\n\nYou managed to get her while she was seeing 3 other guys.  Is that not special enough for you, or did you want her to tell you you were cuter than the other guys or something like that?", "YTA! There\u2019s no way to accuse someone of being cold and incapable of love after they answered your question honestly. We all have criteria for who we will date. Once the basic criteria is met then we might end up loving them. You shouldn\u2019t ask questions if the only acceptable answers are those you\u2019re hoping to hear.", "YTA\n\nDude, it's called *knowing what you want in a relationship.*\n\nEveryone in their adult dating life looking for lasting relationships is doing this in some form. Most might keep tally mentally, she's just being a little more analytical with it.\n\nI used to joke when apple had those ads that said \"there's an app for that,\" as an engineer, I used to say \"I have a spreadsheet for that.\"", ">she said dating only based on feelings and not assessing the whole person is stupid.\n\nShe is quite right. It is good to look at the whole picture when choosing a mate. Relationships are about way more than just feelings.\n\nAs a data person, she used a metric that makes sense to her, even if it seems cold to you.\n\nYTA ~~and lucky if your score doesn't plummet and she dumps you.~~  ETA that if you feel she is cold and unloving, after only 4 months, you need to break it off. If you are hoping she will change, you two are not compatible. Move on.", "\u201cI\u2019m still wowed that I got her\u201d \n\nAndddd she\u2019s gone. YTA", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nShe picked you, so clearly you met her requirements over the other guys. She has an analytical and calculating mind which is very common for marh/engineering types.\n\nYou asked and she was upfront and honest about it. Your problem if that's not what you wanted", "YTA and an Idiot.\nShe obviously has high standards and wants someone she\u2019s compatible with, and CHOSE YOU. And she\u2019s not wrong. Many people get with someone they love, not someone you like. She clearly likes you if you passed. And yea like others said, a chart is kinda silly to most of us. But we all do the same thing when seeing someone. We just aren\u2019t making a chart of it.", "YTA - Her rubric is just a way to figure out her own standards.\n\nDoes the guy have kids with an ex?  That might be points \n\nDoes the guy live with his parents?  Worth X amount of - points\n\nShe has a logical system that works for her, she can base dating on both that and emotional connection to someone.", "Sorry OP but YTA here. If feelings were all a relationship needed then we probably wouldn\u2019t have so many failed relationships. My partner and I love each other and marriage is in our future but we definitely wouldn\u2019t have gotten here without weighing the pros and cons instead of thinking with our heart. In a world where men try to take advantage of women all the time you should grateful you found a woman who thinks you meet all of her criteria, if that\u2019s even still the case.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone has standards for who they date, your girlfriend is just self-aware enough to realize what combination of traits she needs in a partner.\n\nI\u2019m sure you have your own unwritten criteria for who you date.", "YTA play stupid games win stupid prizes. Don't ask questions like that, how would you answer it any better? Do you think she would be satisfied with your answer?", "YTA. If you want an ego boost, ask her for a compliment. Don't go nosing around looking to be told how wonderful you are without having to ask for it and then throw a fit when she doesn't read your mind.", "Everyone has standards and dealbreakers, and part of dating is looking for someone who meets your criteria and where you meet their criteria. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met people who were good-looking but you didn\u2019t have a spark with, or their laugh was annoying, or they hated food you loved - that\u2019s all an informal measure if your compatibility and they failed to meet the mark.\n\nYour girlfriend is just approaching this a bit more rigorously than a lot of people do, and is able to clearly define to herself what she wants in a partner. I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing.\n\nOn learning that you met your girlfriend\u2019s criteria for the type of guy she wants to be in a relationship with, you belittled and insulted her.

It also makes perfect sense because you would want someone who is compatible with you intellectually, financially, sexually, etc. You want to be able to tolerate their cleanliness levels both with personal hygiene and how they keep the house. You want to be able to understand and live with their politics, religious, and policy stances. EVERYONE should do what she does. And everyone eventually does what she does, they just usually do it after they are married. It's why a lot of divorce happens. When people evaluate these things too late, esp when people evaluate financial issues too late.

I would hate to have been scored and my numbers compared against 3 other candidates. Love is not just about your assets but also about connection, and that is something that cannot be quantified, it is either there or not there. As Jane Austin taught us, it is both sense and sensibility. She clearly has issues of control and the problem is when it comes to emotions - if you allow yourself to feel them - you are always taking a risk and letting go of some control.

Also... she's right. Women need to be twice as careful when they date.", "YTA Lists and scores are extremely useful for weeding out people in the early dating phase if you're looking for a long-term relationship. Relying on feelings won't save a relationship if they're incompatible on other levels. \"I really like you and I have thought this through and I think we are a really good fit\" is actually nicer than \"I am romantically attracted to you so let's give it a go\" in my book.\n\nI've actually designed lists with friends so that we could discuss the scoring. I don't think it's cold at all but quite mature. A friend of mine did a pro/con list before he proposed to his wife to make sure he thought everything through.

I get where she\u2019s coming from. I don\u2019t quantify it in the quite the same way, but I do have sort of a rubric in my head. I\u2019ve had people that I\u2019ve been attracted to and had feelings for, but who I also knew that realistically I didn\u2019t have a future with. Obviously, there\u2019s no guarantees, but especially when you are looking for a long term partner, life compatibility can be super important. Relationships are super complicated, and honestly they can use a little distance to evaluate.", "YTA\n\nMore people should have her approach, it'd lead to longer and more stable relationships.", "YTA.\n\nMore importantly, what was an acceptable answer?\n\"You have great eyes?\"\n\"You just felt like the one?\"\n\nThis seems closest to an answer that would actually answer the question well...", "YTA for baiting her with questions like \"Would you love me if I was a worm?\" \n\nAnd then calling her cold for not immediately validating your feelings but answering your question honestly and with the reality that she considered you as a person with faults and positives, and found you most compatible for both your goals and aspirations.", "YTA You asked a question you couldn\u2019t handle the answer to and got mad at her about it. This could have been any question: body count, plans for kids, ideal vacation destination\u2026 if you don\u2019t agree with your GF of four months, just politely disagree and reevaluate. You don\u2019t have to have a fight and you certainly don\u2019t have to call her names.\n\nMost people have standards, but haven\u2019t considered them. I had a really bad breakup then wrote all my standards down. Next guy I dated met and exceeded all of those. We\u2019ve been married 21 years. Now I didn\u2019t make it math because I\u2019m not gifted that way but I stan a spreadsheet Queen with precision.

I give this one a 6/10", "Okay, so when is she making this rubric thing of hers into an app and where can all the sensible people who despair about the poor dating choices of others buy it? \nYour gf is a data science rockstar, YTA for getting your knickers in a twist over this, of course she fancies you! \nHer reasoning is sound, this is literally why rich people send their kids to posh schools, so they choose from their pre selected peers not some random who may be poor or not share their perceived values. This lady has just taken it up a level to select a group of potentially compatible partners and see who she finds most attractive in that group. \nTherefore if you follow the reasoning through to it\u2019s logical conclusion (as I\u2019m sure she did) you are the hottest guy on her specially selected list - not too bad hey? Just take the win.", "I don't think anyone wants to hear that the reason their partner is dating them is because they fit a certain equation. She seems very logical which is fine but it can't all be logic - does she seem like she has genuine feelings for you? Do you feel loved/supported? Did she express anything along the lines of feelings?\n\nGoing into a relationship based on feelings and attraction alone often leads to disappointment - we all have some criteria or a list of non-negotiables. I was dating a guy who I really liked but he had a bit of a gambling habit so I chose not to pursue it. I guess he didn't fit my 'rubric'. Maybe her only fault was expressing this in a manner most don't - if I was asked the same question, I'd list my partners qualities as the reason why I chose them...she's obviously more maths minded. \n\nMy only concern would be that IF she is basing the relationship solely on what you provide, will she stick around if something happens that rendered you unable to provide those things for a time?", "I think people are being too harsh on you.  I get it, no one likes being reduced to a number.  But it sounds like she loves math and numbers and that's how she relates to the world.  That's her language.  So YTA a little bit for getting mad at her for being honest with you and communicating with you in her own way.  \n\nMay not be the case here, but I can't help but think of a scenario where perhaps an extremely brilliant person maybe has, let's say autism, and numbers are their thing, and from their perspective they have given you the best compliment ever, and you completely misinterpreted it and saw it as reducing you to an equation instead of trying to meet her in the middle and understand what she was trying to tell you.\n\nA lot of people see the world in different ways.  Doesn't mean she's incapable of love, may just be that she expresses it differently.", "YTA. This smart logical woman has high standards and you met them.

She explained and went about this in a very left brain kind of way, but it's basically just a different method of what we all do. Honestly, her method is genius, because it forces her to prioritize what she knows she needs, and not overlook a ton of red flags because she's infatuated and making excuses through rose colored glasses.", "YTA, but soft. Here\u2019s the reason, everyone is different. I\u2019m willing to bet she is probably a Scorpio or INTJ personality. People are either led by their logical side or emotional side. She\u2019s just logical. It makes sense to her. Just like how you would pick a partner makes sense to you. I think this is just a difference of opinion on how you both process information.

You can make decisions with your heart and brain *together.* I've dated both a math major (in college) and a scientist (in graduate school) and they were perfectly capable of using both brains and feelings. \n\nBut also telling her she's incapable of love is mean and out of line. \n\nHer: She *is* being cold, and also the way she spoke about her friends and who they dated is extremely judgmental and gross. \n\nAs someone who tends to be more closed off with people and who needs time to let my partners get past my really tough outer shell, I understand letting logical brain lead the way when you're feeling vulnerable. But that's different from \"I assessed you in a rubric and decided you meet my demands and therefore you are acceptable to date and that's the beginning and end of it.\" What kind of relationship and partnership would *that* breed?\n\nI just... am kind of repulsed by both of you here.", "Sounds like the gf is an INTJ", "I\u2019m not even going to read the story.\n\nIf your girlfriend is cold and incapable of love why are you dating her?\n\nIf she isn\u2019t, why is that the title? \n\nAnnoying", "YTA. Putting some effort into thinking about how compatible you are with your partner is actually pretty smart. Creating some math algorithm for this is a little... extra?

You stated yourself that she is a math major and a data scientist. Don't be surprised that she phrased the answer in the way her mind works.

A relationship is hard work at times. Feelings can fluctuate - not to mention lead you into a relationship that is abusive.

That way when things are a struggle you can see a reason tk keep fighting - rather than realizing you wasted 5 yrs of your life on lust.

In the long run though, there are going to be points in a relationship where the  romance isn\u2019t there and the good qualities that you value your partner for are what are getting you through. I would also add that having one partner be super analytical and one be super romantic can be hard, which I think is the case here, but that\u2019s how my husband and I are. I am the more romantic one, and sometimes I get frustrated when I don\u2019t \u2018feel the romance\u2019, but we balance each other out and overall I think our relationship is better for it.", "Lmao", "Lol, yeah YTA op. I guarantee she isn\u2019t solely basing her love life off the rubric. She\u2019s using it as a template to force herself to consider MORE than just her feelings.

It doesn\u2019t. She can feel real emotion and also balance it with a more scientific approach to planning her life. Sounds like you really dig her, so this seems like a weird hill to die on. But if you really can\u2019t handle her mathematical approach to things then I guess you two aren\u2019t a good match. Because I guarantee her love life isn\u2019t the only thing she does this for.

She sounds like a very serious person looking for a serious relationship - and that will take more than feelings and romance.", "She approached things in a very analytical way, but she\u2019s absolutely right that compatibility is about more than feelings.
