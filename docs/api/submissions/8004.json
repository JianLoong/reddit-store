The petting snakes they try to handle daily, because they go to schools as an awareness program, and they need the snaeks to be okay around kids.", "Is it weird that I read that in Sam Elliott's voice?", "No?  The thing is, OP never asked the coworker to leave. \n\nAnd that is the part that I meant needed a professional and firm response to.\n\nPeople keep saying OP was setting boundaries, but the only real boundary OP set is that there would be no dog petting.  \n\nAs I see it, up until the insults started, it was just a rather benign conversation.\n\nIf OP had told coworker to leave, (before or after the insult) and coworker didn't?

How had she insulted him when he responded with a passive aggressive \"cool\" rather than an answer of any kind?
