{"id": 12170, "submission_id": "11pv75i", "title": "AITA for cancelling a wedding gift without notice to a wedding I was previously invited to?", "selftext": "A couple of months ago I (26F, on the spectrum - this will be important later) received a text message from this couple (25M, 25F) I studied with in HS. They asked if I would like to go to their wedding that would happen this year.\n\nThey said the formal invitations would come on the physical mail, but they sent to everyone invited an email with the details and the wedding gift list. I payed for an upgrade on their honeymoon.\n\nIn this email I could see who was invited because of the addresses being visible, so I skimmed through the names to see who was going and who I could sit with - and one of them was a couple I also knew from HS. I sent them a message to mention I would also be at the wedding and would look forward to see them and we started to catch up.\n\nThe problem came when the physical wedding invitations came just 2 weeks before the actual wedding. It was stated that people with disabilities would have a hard time attending the wedding because of the location. It is an outside wedding and the place where it's happening can't make accommodations.\n\nI honestly got very mad. If someone who had a disability had planned to go they had a 2 week notice to cancel their plans. But then I thought it made no sense for them to directly invite someone with a disability then uninvite them with the invite, so the real reason was something else.\n\nThat couple I mentioned from HS had a kid very early on who is now 6, and she happens to have a disability. To me that was a message to the couple not to bring the kid.\n\nThe thing is, despite them not knowing about it, I am autistic. And where I am from, autism is a form of disability.\n\nI felt really sorry for the kid's couple because that's just a shitty thing to do. Also I thought the wedding couple was pretty dumb because I don't even think the kid couple was planning on taking their daughter. So I sent them a message saying I wouldn't be able to sit with them because I am disabled and was uninvited, and they said well, we are not coming anymore either.\n\nSo 5 days before the wedding I canceled my gift.\n\nSo now it's 8 days AFTER the wedding and I get a text message from the couple asking why I canceled my gift and expecting me to pay them money. They got to their honeymoon, thought they were under the upgraded package I previously payed for and used a lot of perks. So the bill came and it's a lot higher than they expected. So I just said guys you uninvited me to your wedding and I'm not paying for anything. After that they posted the story on social media saying I am the one being rude since they didn't know they were uninviting me, and I should have known better since the uninvite was for someone else. People are in general at taking their side.\n\nI didn't think I was being the asshole, but by the sheer number of people agreeing with them I could be. There is a lot of social situations I just don't get because of the spectrum thing, so just fire away if I am being a horrible person or if this is a \"gray area\". So, AITA?\n\nEDIT/ Just to make it clear: I knew I wasn't uninvited. The reason I cancelled going was because I was standing up to a community I am a part of - if they had stated on the initial invite through the email that the place was hard to be accessible, I wouldn't have done this. But they waited until they sent the physical invitations on a two week notice. That was, to me, incredibly disrespectful towards disabled people.\n\nSECOND EDIT/ I am going to sleep and this is getting a little more attention than I expected. I think from what I gathered I am either TA or ESH, which just basically says I did act assholery. Thank you for all the inputs and suggestions on what I could have done differently!

An outside wedding having a difficult time accommodating disabilities means something closer to it's not wheelchair accessible. This message was not for you.\n\nThat said, you bowed out. People who do not attend weddings are not obligated to send gifts.\n\nHowever, nowhere in your story do I see you TELLING the couple you had RSVP'ed to that you regretfully suddenly could not make it. This was in my view inconsiderate. The couple can hardly be blamed for thinking you snubbed them by not sending a gift. There may well have been so many guests and details to keep track of that they do not actually know you missed the wedding.", "YTA! There was NO \"UNINVITE\". Not for you, and not for anyone else. Ugh, I'm so annoyed at reading you stating that as a fact. \"they didn't know they were uninviting me, and I should have known better since the uninvite was for someone else.\" What uninvite? Nobody said there was an uninvite. No, dude, that's your interpretation, stop stating it as though it's a fact. Your misguided leaps of logic have been astounding. And you lied to the other couple! \n\nWow, you're not just an a\\*shole, you're an a\\*shole it's dangerous to know by extension. \n\n1. Telling people there will be difficulties managing access to a venue is not a disinvitation. It means be aware, and decide accordingly. \n2. How did you in your supreme insight, intuit that this particular couple, with that particular child was the intended \"disinvitee\"? Could there not have been someone else who may have brought to the couple's attention that their location may not be accessible? Someone who, I don't know, bothered to contact them and ask a question? \n3. Why would you phrase it as an \"uninvite\" to the couple with the child. That is deliberately misleading. \n4. You said absolutely nothing, to anyone, about anything....but you think you're advocating for someone? Were they supposed to have your Sherlockian skills to intuit what your absence meant or that you were upset? \n5. Was there really, no other option that you could intuit for someone noting that accessibility issue other than, gee, I guess they don't want a class of people there? Like maybe, if they're sending out a physical invitation 2 weeks before the date, they didn't have that many options available? The best they could do was Literally APOLOGIZE to people in writing, and ask them to kindly understand the limitations of their hosts? That offended you so deeply, on other people's behalf? Because you said you weren't doing it because you felt slighted!\n\nUgh, the level of presumption in you post is awful. \n\nIt's like you had an entire conversation in your head, then convinced yourself actually happened. It did not happen.", "As an autistic female about your age, YTA. Let's go over how:\n\n1) They were saying they couldn't accommodate wheelchairs at the venue, not that anyone in a wheelchair was uninvited.\n\n2) You assumed they meant to uninvite someone when their intention could have just been to give them a warning so they would be prepared.\n\n3) It might suck that they only gave a two-week notice, but it's also possible that they didn't know until then.\n\n4) You didn't show up and didn't tell them you weren't going.\n\n5) You cancelled your gift without telling them, and they didn't find out until after they were billed for it. This is a huge asshole move.\n\n6) Talked a couple into not showing up to the wedding by telling them disabled people weren't invited. Might not have been your exact words, but telling them \"I'm uninvited because I'm disabled\" pretty much sends that message.\n\n7) You knew they weren't talking about you, but decided, unnecessarily, to fight someone else's battle anyways. If the child in the wheelchair was really being uninvited, the parents could've handled that on their own.\n\n8) Ultimately, you decided to do all this pointless, petty bs instead of talking to them.\n\nThey weren't being ableist, you were making assumptions and reacting to those instead of actually talking to them.\n\nIf you want to make it up to them, give them the money, apologize for how you handled things, and make an effort to figure out how to handle situations like this more appropriately in the future.", "I understand your feelings on the invitation and I think they are beyond rude for demanding money - but I also think YTA for cancelling the honeymoon upgrade.  Once you give a gift, it\u2019s given, you should not take it back.  And if this couple knew about it, it was given.  \n\n(That was a very generous gift for casual friends.  You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do that in the future.)", "YTA. And I would have done the same thing. Sometimes you are okay being an asshole.", "INFO: you said they had sent an email with the wedding details prior to the formal invitations. Was there information there about whether it would be indoors/outdoors? And in what ways was the venue not accessible for people with disabilities?", "YTA.\n\nYou knew it wasn\u2019t about you and decided to create drama out of it. \n\nSo what that they chose an outdoor wedding that isn\u2019t handicap accessible? This is their big day and can choose how they want it to be. If someone can\u2019t attend, that\u2019s a shame but it\u2019s not their responsibility to cater to the entire worlds capabilities. \n\nWho knows, maybe someone\u2019s plus one was recently in an accident and were wheelchair bound and they wanted to let them know before they got to the event that it would be difficult to make it down to the event. Could they have reach out directly? Sure. However, have you ever planned a wedding? There\u2019s a million and a half things to do and you don\u2019t always have time to do everything right.", "YTA. You based your decision on an unfounded assumption. How do you know that guests with physical disabilities weren\u2019t previously told that they couldn\u2019t be accommodated? For all you know they told these guests individually months in advance and the notice about it in the invitation was just a reminder. You don\u2019t even know if any of their guests are physically disabled. You should have reached out to the couple and expressed your concerns before you canceled your gift without them a heads up.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA. I don\u2019t understand why you assumed that you were uninvited. All you had to do was ask. Also, my sisters (2 are on the spectrum) have attended weddings and done well. They love being outside too. I\u2019m going to end this with you should\u2019ve just asked the couple getting married if you were still invited or not.", "Info: Did you actually reach out and talk about the situation or did you assume this was a message?  Did you talk to the couple with a kid before either?", "ESH. \n\nYTA because they did not uninvite you. The notice on the invitation as you have described it was obviously referring to physical disabilities and how they couldn\u2019t be accommodated at the venue. You went on this wild assumption train that the disclaimer was aimed at a child who may not have even been invited in the first place and then that it also included you. You also assumed it was an attempt to uninvite anyone at all which was an odd  leap even though you happened to be correct. \n\nIf you had an issue with the couple doing this last minute to the extent that you no longer wished to attend, you could have changed your RSVP. It sounds like you just didn\u2019t show up without telling them which makes you TA. \n\nThe couple is also TA because they admitted that they were attempting to uninvite someone with this action. They should have just spoken to whoever it was directly instead of sending a weird disclaimer to the whole group.", "Hoo boy.  Okay so you're both TA and not TA.  You were absolutely right to be livid at them for their handling of the disability thing.  What they did was disrespectful and discriminatory.  They fact that they targeted someone with a disability (\"uninvite intended for someone else\") is just yuck.  They are total AH for this, and if they didn't want that other person there then they should not have invited them in the first place.  This also highlights the whole \"invisible disability\" problem.  Never mind who the hell sends out wedding invites 2 weeks before the event.\n\nSo, the part that makes you an AH is the fact that you didn't tell them you canceled the gift.  That was unnecessarily punitive.\n\nI'm going to have to come down on the side of ESH, but yours is 50.1% AH and 49.9% not TA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were the one that chose not to go. So that's on you. But any behavior you've displayed afterwards, is just rude and entitled.

For the record, I'm also autistic. \n\nThe couple should have reached out to the couple with the disabled child directly.

It would be a *bigger* presumption for them to assume that every other attendee was currently able-bodied enough for the space; it was considerate of them to let all guests know. As for the short notice, I can't imagine that would be intentional; I can only assume that they realised at the last minute that the space would be unsuitable for wheelchair navigation.\n\nYou are also TA. If you actually wanted to advocate for disabled people, you should have spoken to the wedding couple directly. You could have talked with them to understand what happened and see if you could help with a solution. Instead you made it all about you and your principles.

And OP fits in the category. There\u2019s the argument that OP should have had the courtesy to notify them of their absence because the couple paid for food and stuff with OP\u2019s attendance in mind.

So that heads up on the invitation was great to know. I would have sent a gift and not attended. It does suck the made it so not everyone is included but I think those with disabilities also need to self-advocate / ask questions about accessibility. We are well aware we miss out on things.

The conclusion OP came to was logical. While a lot of commenters are saying that OP made a lot of assumptions, the problem is the opposite, OP made no assumptions about what the couple meant by disabled people cannot come. The couple wasn't specific about which kinds of disabilities couldn't be accommodated, which means that OP is technically right. There are quite a few comments here saying that it is clear that that would refer to disabled people with mobility issues, but that is an assumption given the context of an outdoor wedding. If the wedding couple wanted to uninvite someone specific, they should have done that instead of just giving a vague statement and hoping that everyone got the intended message. OP took this at face value. Here (presumably) allistic people used broad language and assumed that everyone would \"catch their drift\" and when an autistic person responded by understanding the message literally, the allistic people got upset. \n\nThat said, ESH. The wedding couple is ableist and shouldn't be asking for any money at this point. And OP, you should've changed your RSVP and either have given the gift anyway or have sent a memo that you were no longer gifting it before the honeymoon. If the gift had been something physical on the registry like a stand mixer or something, silently ungifting wouldn't have been as much a problem and you'd be NTA.

Maybe it was a kids free wedding and they sent the heads up \"hey, it's actually inaccessible, please don't attempt to kid crash\" or something along those lines, I don't know.\n\nBut it's extremely punitive to RSVP yes, upgrade their wedding gift, then no-show and rescind wedding gift without a) so much as a fact finding conversation to gather what was actually going on, b) to at the very least tell them you're canceling (and thus not expect your gift to stand).\n\nIt's so incredibly tacky and insensitive to leave newlyweds standing, humiliated on their honeymoon over a rescinded gift with no explanation. If they were wrong- tell them such. Able bodied have ZERO REASON to think about disabled because they have the privilege of not dealing with those issues daily. This doesn't make them bad people, it makes them unaware, ignorant and again privileged. Take the time to educate before punishing.\n\nYeah that said... YTA. Hard.

Where you had a blind spot was not telling them you wouldn't be paying for the upgrade on their honeymoon. I don't know your financial situation and don't need to but it seems like that was a very generous gift, perhaps overly so, but only you know that. Had you bought them a toaster and then decided not to go to the wedding and returned it, no one would be the wiser. But since they thought they were upgraded and already had an expectation of an experience it would have been good to let  them know.\n\nThat being said, I'm a little confused. You say you canceled the gift 5 days before the wedding, so it seems odd the honeymoon venue (cruise? hotel? skydiving?) didn't inform them of the change. They bear some responsibility there imo. How did the bill come and they didn't know how high it would be? That just sounds off to me. Even if you didn't find out ahead of time, I can't imagine a scenario where at some sort of check-in you didn't find out your upgrade wasn't happening. If something like that happened to me I'd be surprised at check-in, then try to contact you to see if everything was ok. Maybe it was a mistake and you already paid? IDK but I wouldn't just start grabbing upgrades and spa packages and expect you to pay for whatever I added.

It's not ableist. It's... obviously uninformed. It wasn't how *I* would have handled it.\n\nBut it also wasn't even an \"uninvite\".

Should they have reached out individually to each person they *thought* could have an issue with the location and ask if they needed any?  How rude and presumptuous to assume anything about a persons abilities or need for accommodations. Disabled people are adults and do not need well meaning third parties to \u201chelp\u201d them do adult things. And if they did, they\u2019d probably not designate a stranger to do it for them.

More guessing or maybe quizzing people on their medical conditions? \n\nSee, it\u2019s a no win situation. So if you\u2019re going to assume, maybe assume that people are trying their best. Assume that it\u2019s a tricky situation and people don\u2019t always land on the A+ answer. Assume that if you have a concern, a *friend* would want to know and explain any misunderstanding.

If they realized afterwards that it was inaccessible, why not call directly the disabled person to explain and apologize?", "They are most definitely lost, in more ways than one.", "Not rude. Are you lost? Why all the hostility?", "Very much sounds like bride and groom went \"Shit, So-n-so is wheelchair bound and we don't have access. How were we to know she was wheelchair bound?.. who else is wheelchair bound and we don't know? Fuck, uh... update everyone?\"", "I would agree if not for the line \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to speak directly\u201d. Granted, this isn\u2019t perfect grammar, but this sounds like they are saying they preferred to edit the group invite because they didn\u2019t want to directly communicate with one person. \n\nThis is just weird. But OP\u2019s interpretations were also a leap, so I don\u2019t actually disagree with your sentiment. Weird choices were made.", "Oh it was most definitely rude.  Some people avoid confrontation like the plague.  Still though, I don't see it as them necessarily uninviting anyone as much as them realizing their mistake a little too late."]}
