It\u2019s not the sole income, but it is a substantial part, because my mom is an illegal immigrant and only able to get paid under the table, and part time at that. \n\nI got into a top college, and due to my family\u2019s financial status, I got a full ride\u2014 no tuition, room and board, etc\u2014 for financial reasons. This isn\u2019t tied to academic performance and guaranteed for as long as I attend, so it\u2019s a crazy opportunity\u2014 I have the opportunity to go to a top college for free, and this will lead to much, much more opportunities. Unfortunately, it\u2019s across the country from where I live. \n\nMy mom is begging me not to go\u2014 my sister is too young to work for a few years, and my mother doesn\u2019t make much, so if I left instead of staying and continuing to support the family, they\u2019d be forced to have an even worse standard of life. I told them, I\u2019ll continue working until the end of summer, but I *have* to go. Going hurts us short term, since my family will have less money, but not going hurts long term\u2014 going gives me the opportunity, in a few years, to make *lots* of money, which can be much more helpful than what I can do as a high school graduate working minimum wage. And plus, for selfish reasons, I want to go. I want to learn, and live a life vastly different from my mom\u2019s life. I want to be *great*.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided that I need to go, both for altruistic and selfish reasons. I know it will be hard on my mom and sister, but they\u2019ll figure out a way to survive. I\u2019ll be working full time over the summer rather than just part time, so that should be a little extra to tide them over. In  2 years, my sister will be able to work too. So I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make it. \n\nMy mom thinks I\u2019m incredibly selfish to leave her and my 12-year-old sister to struggle, and even my sister is telling me their life will be much worse without me here. It does make me feel guilty, but I feel, if I give this up now, I\u2019ll someday end up in the same position as my mom, only with an opportunity to change everything that I never took. \n\nAm I selfish?

This is a huge opportunity and you deserve to make a better future.", "NTA. You are not responsible for anyone but yourself unless you have a kid someday.", "NTA. Congrats on the opportunity fr bro. You gotta snatch that up. Just like you said it will help your fam in the long run and tbh they have no choice/say in what you do or where you go. \n\nNo offense to your mother at all as she is in a very difficult position but she doesn\u2019t have the right to put you in the position to work your whole life to provide. I know many families are forced to but its not right. Its your life bro. Enjoy it.", "NTA.   \nNot even close.   \nPoint out to your mum that you get a free ride NOW, and in a few short years can support her financially much better with the amazing career.   \nor you can be incredibly short sighted, not go, and lose all of that and work in low paid jobs indefinitely.   \nAnd while other universities are good, the benefit of a top table university does impact your future earning potential, usually you\u2019ll start at a higher salary and increases will go up from there\u2026 you\u2019ll be looked at for more prestigious places and jobs\u2026 and yes it\u2019s sucky for those who don\u2019t get this opportunity, but if anyone shoudl take advantage of the privilege of this\u2026 it\u2019s YOU.", "NTA,  I understand that it a tough situation but if you miss this window then there might never be another.

Never burn yourself out trying to make other life better", "NTA, this opportunity is a lightning strike and won\u2019t happen again.

I assume when you graduate you will continue to send money home. Also, as others have said, you can work and go to college at the same time. In fact, if you have financial needs, you can get work study jobs that pay you while you get some real/tangential experience in your chosen field. And it pays more than typical since half the pay is government subsidized. (At least they had those when I went to college a long time ago. You should look into the possibility.)", "NTA\u2026 Go to school! Take care of yourself too! In the long run you will be able to help them more if you do this for yourself and the cycle of poverty can end with you. Your mom can make it work, she did before you could work and you leaving is one less mouth to care for.. your mom is incredibly selfish to put that kind of guilt on you. I\u2019m so sorry but do this for yourself it\u2019s not selfish to want better!", "NAH, your family don't know what to do and that's making them afraid. Understandably.

You're right though, sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better. \n\nWhat if you were to get hurt instead of being in college? The end result would still be the loss of income for a time. This way you have exponentially better prospects for yourself and your family.", "NTA. It\u2019s very mature and caring of you to want to help and think of this in the long term.

Before you were old enough to work, your family survived with 3 mouths to feed and shelter.  Now with only 2, it will be slightly cheaper even with all the inflation going on.  Will it be easy?  No, not even in the slightest but if you don't start forging a path for yourself and your own success you will end up being the family crutch with a major regret always wondering what if.  You got a sweet deal handed to you that a lot of students your age dream of.  You would be insane not to take it.  Work during the summer if you're not taking classes to help out if you can but if you can't, keep your eyes on the prize where a future and career awaits.  You are not responsible for anyone but yourself until you have a family of your own but even then it's a shared responsibility, not all on you.", "NTA.  As you mentioned, short term pain, long term gain.  You focus on your education, your family will struggle a bit, but once you have your degree everyone will benefit.  Go to school and don't feel bad about taking advantage of this great opportunity.", "NTA. This is a great opportunity for you and I\u2019m proud that you have this drive. \nFeeling guilty is normal but it\u2019s unfair to ask you to sacrifice these dreams and opportunity of yours for the current life you\u2019re living. Your sister will start working eventually and when you have time to work in college, you can send money home.\n\neta: it\u2019s okay to put yourself first", "NTA - You have a huge, rare opportunity. There is time fir your mom to start looking for aid. My city, for example, has food pantries that don't card. I'm sure there are some other sorts of resources as well.", "NTA. It's a bit selfish, but appropriately so. Don't worry about it. Your task is to build the best life for yourself. \n\nPeople without education generally do not understand how much good an education can do for a person. And how would they? They haven't been to a university, so through no fault of their own they really can't know.", "NTA\nI was kinda in a similar situation. My family didn\u2019t want me to leave for college bc it wasn\u2019t culturally appropriate to do so. I\u2019m the oldest and a women so the expectations where that I was going to take care of my family financially and run the household. I am my families retirement plan. We are a low income immigrant family. This isn\u2019t uncommon in my family. I made the same choice as you and left. A lot family members disagreed. I basically abandoned my responsibilities and duties, it wasn\u2019t an honorable thing to do. It was hard at first. I felt shame and guilt and I wish someone had given it to me straight. You are not responsible for your parents, their responsible for you: financially/physically/ emotionally. It\u2019s an awful situation that your family is poor, marginalized, discriminated against. The reality is that no matter how shitty their situation is, it is not your responsibility to take care of a grown adult or their child. You need to worry about yourself because you are the only one who\u2019s gonna have to live with yourself and the effects of whatever choice you make, no one else. If you stay you are gonna be regretful, resentful, and sad thinking of what if. That isn\u2019t living, just because all you know is surviving doesn\u2019t mean it has to be like that forever. You now have the power to help yourself so do not feel bad for taking the opportunity to make your life better possible.", "NTA, but I wouldn't say it's because you're not responsible for anyone but yourself. This has come up a couple of times in other posts I've seen recently but it sounds like it's normal in your culture to be taking care of your family. You are absolutely right though, this is an AMAZING opportunity for you and literally a once in a lifetime opportunity that you can't pass up. Work part-time and send money back to your family. I'm sure you can make it work. And congrats!", "Question? If everything is payed for why not work there and send money home to them?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Check with your financial aid office at the school, see what suggestions they have, and if you hadn't applied with the FAFSA do so immediately if it's not too late to see what other funding you could be eligible for.  Uni's understand that a you'll never be 100% covered, which is why you need to explore every option available.

Your mom isn\u2019t mean or dumb or evil like some others have suggested. She is scared. For herself and your sister, but also for you to be so far away doing something she doesn\u2019t quite understand (I\u2019m guessing college looks different in the US than in whatever country she came from). But that doesn\u2019t make her right. Go. Get a great education. Get a career instead of a job. Your whole family will be better off in the long run because it it. It will be worth the struggle for you and your family. But you can do it!\n\nAnd a note just for you: whatever school you are going to will have lots of resources, especially for first generation college students. Find them and use them frequently! You are going to be hit with waves of doubt when college gets hard and it\u2019s going to feel like you don\u2019t belong. You do belong! College is hard for everyone, and you have some extra challenges to overcome, but those challenges have made you stronger. Keep working and you\u2019ll make it through, but don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help\u2026there are people on campus who\u2019s entire job is to help students succeed, so take advantage of that even if your friends don\u2019t. And know there is an internet stranger in California rooting for you!", "Nta Your mom is a selfish lazy criminal.  She broke the law to come to this country and now expect you to sacrifice your own future life.  She made the decision to put her self in a condition where she will be poor.  She had years to fix her immigration status. Her mistake. She should pay the cosiquences not you. Go to college.Build yourself a better life. The alternative is to be held back by a selfish mom who will keep you down for ever.", "NTA.  Everyone's life will be better in the long term if you get an education.  You're not running away from home, you're taking an opportunity to get educated so you'll all live better.", "NTA.  You don't have to sacrifice yourself in the name of family.  Your mother is a grown woman and is supposed to be responsible for her children.  It is admirable and good to help your family, but to sacrifice your education opportunity to support your mother and little sister is beyond your scope--she is the parent for god's sake.  I don't understand parents who do this to their children.", "NTA\n\nGo.....go to the college.  Your mom and sister will be fine.  Your mom should have been prepared several years before you plan on going to the college by saving up or whatever that she needs to plan ahead.  But she didn't plan ahead, it's on her, not you.  You really don't oblige to stay and take care of your mom and sister without going to the college.  Just go, they'll figure out.  Once you get a good job, you can take care of them if you want to, fine.\n\nGO!  You won't regret even though there'll be hardship on your family temporarily.\n\nOn edit:  Your sister can help by babysitting for a couple of hours during day time to give the moms some break until she gets older to go for a part time job.", "NTA. But let me make a suggestion. Can you talk to a guidance counselor about putting your family in touch with a social worker to help your finances?  I recently had to help out a friend in a financial jam and apparently, there is rent support, food support, utility support, all available to those who qualify. A social worker will know the local programs available to your family and will help your mom turn in the paperwork she needs. Sounds like your family has needed this for a while so might be a way for your family to be ok when you go off to college. Best of luck to you!", "Go!

You've been given the opportunity to chase it so go and get it!", "You need to go to school.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYou are not selfish. To be honest, your mother is far more selfish here.\n\nGo to school. This is a huge opportunity for you and you do not want to miss out on it.\n\nAlso - do NOT feel pressured to work at school to send money back to your family. If that works distracts you from school and drops your grades, you\u2019ll be in a bad situation.", "NTA, but as you said, you are being selfish.\nYou've already made your decision and I don't think you'd want any unsolicited advice.", "NAH. I'm a high school senior facing a similar situation - I know my family will be fine, but it's still incredibly hard to make myself leave them, and I know it's incredibly hard for them to let their son go. Your mother is likely feeling the same - your mom will miss you as a person, not just as a source of income. Also, working to support the family alone is going to be incredibly tough for her. This may be what's causing her to try to hold you back at home, but you can't blame her for that. However, you are your own person, with your own dreams and ambitions - being given the chance to have a much better life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I want to be *great*.\n\nAnd that's why you will be. That enthusiasm, that zeal is something many teenagers know too well. You've been given a chance many would die for - if it means everybody lives a better life, so much the better. Just make sure that if you go, don't forget your family, and remember the opportunities you have been given and still have in the future.", "NTA. I know you are having doubts, and it's understandable considering your family situation, but please go to this university. Chances like this are rare, and you will be mad at yourself for the rest of your life if you don't take advantage of it.

Contact the school's admissions office and ask about any legal clinics for immigration that they know of. If your new school has a law school, they should have a free clinic or at least know of something. They may also have legal resources for students that you can start accessing. Also look locally, maybe at law schools near you, obviously needs to be a free resource but find out what you can to get your mom on the path to a green card. \n\nI'm sorry that this chance feels so tenuous. And you shouldn't have to be in the position to support your family at your age.", "NTA. Is it selfish? Probably, but it's also ok.

Both to starf and to lose you.", "Your 12 year old sister is probably telling you that because she's been told to by your mom. She's old enough to know it's wrong, and your mom?

You must help yourself in order to be able to help them.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the value of a top university. It\u2019s not in the education itself, which for many programs is similar for any midrange college and up. It\u2019s in the networking you\u2019ll do while there, and that will kickstart and sustain your career in ways you may not have even dreamed of yet.\n\nYour family moved for a better life, right? You have a huge opportunity here, both for yourself and for your family.", "NTA. You need to live your life and you are clearly thinking about the long term wellbeing of your family. This education will help them so much in the future. In the meantime, until you leave for school, look up if there are charities available to help them. Push your mom to find more work asap. If you have any friends or neighbpurs who care about your family, talk to them. Ask if they can maybe do things like go to the food bank on behalf of your family (if they don't need it themselves). And work hard over the summer as much as you can to save up some money for them. It will be a tough few years, but I'm sure you guys will be okay in the end. Good luck!", "Oh gee that's a hard choice...\n\nChild, let me say this as a mother. Good parents want their children to grow up to be independent and successful. As far as university goes, many parents actually save up money so they can send their children away to be educated and give them a better chance. They would be extraordinarily grateful if their kids got a free ride. \n\nWhat your parents are doing is crazy. If you are educated, you will have so many more opportunities for money, for meeting people who can help you, for learning things that will open up new worlds for you. There is simply nothing like a university education. \n\nYour part time job was a crutch that helped them in a time in need, but it never could have lasted. The are simply going to have to find some new way to adapt and grow--and they have time to figure out how. There IS a way. There always is. If you got a part time job, then someone else can find a part time job. It may be difficult, but it can happen. There are always ways to find low-wage jobs.\n\nWhat is not easy is making the leap to find solid upper-level jobs that require education. This is your golden ticket. You MUST take it.

As you said, it benefits all of you in the long run. \n\nIf you still want to help your family from afar:\nMy suggestion is to try and get a part time job on campus and set up a joint bank account with your mom where the money will go into. You don\u2019t have to worry about paying for school and room or board, so the amount of money you can send back is fairly high. Plus, it sounds like the college is on CA? The minimum wage is much higher than in Texas, so it will be even more for your family. Just a thought! It\u2019s worth contemplating.

I'm not advocating this as a good idea but if you're constantly concerned about how your family are doing that could distract you from doing well in your studies.", "Idk if it\u2019s been said, but you also have the option to work while you\u2019re in college and send some money home. It\u2019s not the same as being home to financially/emotionally support your family, but it\u2019s still something.

Got some advice as a former first-gen college student and current academic advisor at a top liberal arts university in the US:\n\n- Take the opportunity. No question. In your convo with your Mom, it may help to show her how this will benefit her: Look at the annual cost of attendance (you can find it on the college's website) and multiply it by four. That's effectively how much money you are getting, for *free.* Your Mom doesn't have to feed, clothe, or house you for 3/4 of the year while you are at school, and you can work to bring in income the other 1/4 time. Moreover, it's pretty easy to find low-stress on-campus employment (mail room clerk, library staffing, security guard for a dorm, etc.) where you can do homework while passively making money to send home at the same time. \n\n- Depending on the size of the scholarship, you may have a stipend for books. In my experience, the stipend was far larger than what I actually needed, so the remainder was just free money. YMMV. Note that you will need to pay taxes on money received for room, board, and books, but *not* for tuition/fees. You may also be eligible for other small cash scholarships based on your first-gen status. Contact your college's financial aid department for more info. \n\n- Not money advice but more general: The first semester is the hardest. Always. You're adjusting to a new living environment, new school, new social situations, new ideas, and new responsibilities. You will almost certainly feel \"imposter syndrome,\" but just know that it happens to all of us and will pass as you get your footing.\n\n- Your GPA doesn't matter. As long as you keep it above the line where you would lose your scholarships (ask your financial aid office), you really have no need to stress out about it. This is the biggest mistake I see with former high school overachievers in college and it's a mistake I made myself. Don't slack off (and for the love of God please *go to class*) but realize that the biggest benefit you get from college is not the degree itself--it's the socializing and networking opportunities. Seriously. Get to know your professors and your peers. Attend mixers and socials, and avoid blowing off every social event because you want an A on your final project instead of a B. As the saying goes, \"C's get degrees.\" But connections with people get you access to the best jobs after graduation.", "I saw you're majoring in computer science.

My sister and I contributed financially since we were like 12 and supported them 100% from the time we graduated until they passed, which was a span of about 25 years. We have them a life they could not have otherwise had-not like we were living high class mind you but no one went hungry and everyone had a roof over their head. When you go away work as much as you can, utilize the food pantry at your school, work FT during breaks and try to send a set amount home to help keep them afloat. But they CANNOT be your primary worry and they will benefit when you are done. But you have to do this for you and for them. Your children like mine will never know what it is like to be hungry or evicted and i can\u2019t tell you how much satisfaction that gives me. Still working on busting that generational trauma and so will you but your eyes will be opened in a way you never imagined and this is your ticket-and your family\u2019s-out. Best of luck to you!!!! You got this!!", "She has given OP the role of parent and taken the role of child for herself. I have compassion for someone whose life has taken a downturn, but I don't see the mother trying to make a better life,  only OP."]}
