This isn\u2019t tied to academic performance and guaranteed for as long as I attend, so it\u2019s a crazy opportunity\u2014 I have the opportunity to go to a top college for free, and this will lead to much, much more opportunities. Unfortunately, it\u2019s across the country from where I live. \n\nMy mom is begging me not to go\u2014 my sister is too young to work for a few years, and my mother doesn\u2019t make much, so if I left instead of staying and continuing to support the family, they\u2019d be forced to have an even worse standard of life. I told them, I\u2019ll continue working until the end of summer, but I *have* to go. Going hurts us short term, since my family will have less money, but not going hurts long term\u2014 going gives me the opportunity, in a few years, to make *lots* of money, which can be much more helpful than what I can do as a high school graduate working minimum wage. And plus, for selfish reasons, I want to go. I want to learn, and live a life vastly different from my mom\u2019s life. I want to be *great*.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided that I need to go, both for altruistic and selfish reasons. I know it will be hard on my mom and sister, but they\u2019ll figure out a way to survive. I\u2019ll be working full time over the summer rather than just part time, so that should be a little extra to tide them over. In  2 years, my sister will be able to work too. So I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make it. \n\nMy mom thinks I\u2019m incredibly selfish to leave her and my 12-year-old sister to struggle, and even my sister is telling me their life will be much worse without me here. It does make me feel guilty, but I feel, if I give this up now, I\u2019ll someday end up in the same position as my mom, only with an opportunity to change everything that I never took. \n\nAm I selfish?

This is a huge opportunity and you deserve to make a better future.", "NTA. You are not responsible for anyone but yourself unless you have a kid someday.", "NTA. Congrats on the opportunity fr bro. You gotta snatch that up. Just like you said it will help your fam in the long run and tbh they have no choice/say in what you do or where you go. \n\nNo offense to your mother at all as she is in a very difficult position but she doesn\u2019t have the right to put you in the position to work your whole life to provide. I know many families are forced to but its not right. Its your life bro. Enjoy it.", "NTA.   \nNot even close.   \nPoint out to your mum that you get a free ride NOW, and in a few short years can support her financially much better with the amazing career.   \nor you can be incredibly short sighted, not go, and lose all of that and work in low paid jobs indefinitely.   \nAnd while other universities are good, the benefit of a top table university does impact your future earning potential, usually you\u2019ll start at a higher salary and increases will go up from there\u2026 you\u2019ll be looked at for more prestigious places and jobs\u2026 and yes it\u2019s sucky for those who don\u2019t get this opportunity, but if anyone shoudl take advantage of the privilege of this\u2026 it\u2019s YOU.", "NTA,  I understand that it a tough situation but if you miss this window then there might never be another. Also if you can work part time then you can try working in college and send some money over. It might seem like abandoned but if you stay you will end up a bitter mess. Never burn yourself out trying to make other life better", "NTA, this opportunity is a lightning strike and won\u2019t happen again. If it really comes down to it, don\u2019t party like some of your peers will and get a part time job for 5-10 hours a week and send it to your sister for necessities.", "NTA. I was exactly this child, and frequently babysat for my siblings when I was 10-18. I truly understand the emotional difficulty here, and urge you to stay strong. \n\nYou are 100 percent correct you will do more good by going, and it is NOT selfish to want a life\u2026it is normal and perfectly fine. Doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. \n\nIn my experience giving in to unreasonable demands creates nothing but pain for everyone involved.", "NTA. GO. DO IT. It will most likely improve your life in the long run & give you more opportunities to help your family. Maybe you could even get a paid internship so you're earning money and getting credit at the same time. In the meantime, your mom needs to sign up for every charitable assistance she can find. She could even get a small camper and find a great gig as a workamper. You're not being selfish - you're being smart.", "NTA.  \nAs a parent I'm a bit disappointed that another parent would even think to take away an opportunity like this.   \nPlease go make a better life for you and them.", "NTA. You're right, long term benefits outweigh the short term. It will be challenging for your mother and sister, but this is a big opportunity for you and eventually your sister. It doesn't make your decision easier, but just make sure you take advantage of what you're being given.", "NTA. You are thinking about the future for both you and your family. I assume when you graduate you will continue to send money home. Also, as others have said, you can work and go to college at the same time. In fact, if you have financial needs, you can get work study jobs that pay you while you get some real/tangential experience in your chosen field. And it pays more than typical since half the pay is government subsidized. (At least they had those when I went to college a long time ago. You should look into the possibility.)", "NTA\u2026 Go to school! Take care of yourself too! In the long run you will be able to help them more if you do this for yourself and the cycle of poverty can end with you. Your mom can make it work, she did before you could work and you leaving is one less mouth to care for.. your mom is incredibly selfish to put that kind of guilt on you. I\u2019m so sorry but do this for yourself it\u2019s not selfish to want better!", "NAH, your family don't know what to do and that's making them afraid. Understandably. Just do what you can to help them prepare for the loss of income while you're gone. You're right though, sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better. \n\nWhat if you were to get hurt instead of being in college? The end result would still be the loss of income for a time. This way you have exponentially better prospects for yourself and your family.", "NTA. It\u2019s very mature and caring of you to want to help and think of this in the long term. But as they say, put your oxygen mask on first before you help someone else. \n\nImprove yourself and then help your family when and how you can but not at the cost of your own happiness and future. Best of luck and congratulations on the acceptance to a great college.", "NTA. Go to school. There is a reason this opportunity has come up for you. Do not waste it.", "NTA.\n\nYou can also work part time while attending university and send cash home. It's not mutually exclusive.", "NTA.  Before you were old enough to work, your family survived with 3 mouths to feed and shelter.  Now with only 2, it will be slightly cheaper even with all the inflation going on.  Will it be easy?  No, not even in the slightest but if you don't start forging a path for yourself and your own success you will end up being the family crutch with a major regret always wondering what if.  You got a sweet deal handed to you that a lot of students your age dream of.  You would be insane not to take it.  Work during the summer if you're not taking classes to help out if you can but if you can't, keep your eyes on the prize where a future and career awaits.  You are not responsible for anyone but yourself until you have a family of your own but even then it's a shared responsibility, not all on you.", "NTA.  As you mentioned, short term pain, long term gain.  You focus on your education, your family will struggle a bit, but once you have your degree everyone will benefit.  Go to school and don't feel bad about taking advantage of this great opportunity.", "NTA. This is a great opportunity for you and I\u2019m proud that you have this drive. \nFeeling guilty is normal but it\u2019s unfair to ask you to sacrifice these dreams and opportunity of yours for the current life you\u2019re living. Your sister will start working eventually and when you have time to work in college, you can send money home.\n\neta: it\u2019s okay to put yourself first", "NTA - You have a huge, rare opportunity. There is time fir your mom to start looking for aid. My city, for example, has food pantries that don't card. I'm sure there are some other sorts of resources as well.", "NTA. It's a bit selfish, but appropriately so. Don't worry about it. Your task is to build the best life for yourself. \n\nPeople without education generally do not understand how much good an education can do for a person. And how would they? They haven't been to a university, so through no fault of their own they really can't know.", "NTA\nI was kinda in a similar situation. My family didn\u2019t want me to leave for college bc it wasn\u2019t culturally appropriate to do so. I\u2019m the oldest and a women so the expectations where that I was going to take care of my family financially and run the household. I am my families retirement plan. We are a low income immigrant family. This isn\u2019t uncommon in my family. I made the same choice as you and left. A lot family members disagreed. I basically abandoned my responsibilities and duties, it wasn\u2019t an honorable thing to do. It was hard at first. I felt shame and guilt and I wish someone had given it to me straight. You are not responsible for your parents, their responsible for you: financially/physically/ emotionally. It\u2019s an awful situation that your family is poor, marginalized, discriminated against. The reality is that no matter how shitty their situation is, it is not your responsibility to take care of a grown adult or their child. You need to worry about yourself because you are the only one who\u2019s gonna have to live with yourself and the effects of whatever choice you make, no one else. If you stay you are gonna be regretful, resentful, and sad thinking of what if. That isn\u2019t living, just because all you know is surviving doesn\u2019t mean it has to be like that forever. You now have the power to help yourself so do not feel bad for taking the opportunity to make your life better possible.", "NTA, but I wouldn't say it's because you're not responsible for anyone but yourself. This has come up a couple of times in other posts I've seen recently but it sounds like it's normal in your culture to be taking care of your family. You are absolutely right though, this is an AMAZING opportunity for you and literally a once in a lifetime opportunity that you can't pass up. Work part-time and send money back to your family. I'm sure you can make it work. And congrats!", "Question? If everything is payed for why not work there and send money home to them?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Check with your financial aid office at the school, see what suggestions they have, and if you hadn't applied with the FAFSA do so immediately if it's not too late to see what other funding you could be eligible for.  Uni's understand that a you'll never be 100% covered, which is why you need to explore every option available.

It is NOT your responsibility to take care of things like you are the parent, and she should express gratitude for those things you have been helping out with because again it\u2019s ultimately not your responsibility.

I was an international student at a very prestigious US college and about to become a professor at one. I think that there is no doubt about it that you should go, and you should not feel guilty about going at all. You should be proud of yourself. Because you have voiced some concerns about how you will perform once there, I was thinking: you could take a look and figure out what courses you will take your first year. If there is an obligatory class that reads the canon, you can figure out what these books are, and use a local library or the internet to read a bit during the summer, time permitting. Once there, find a mentor to discuss work load (you are brilliant for getting in and I have no doubt you will make it, but it is always good to have someone to talk to).

Subpar at least as compared to others going to that school so she will need to work harder than the other students to catch up.  She probably won\u2019t have time for a part time job.

That makes me believe that she came to whatever country you live in to give her children a better life.  Well, a 'better life' has presented itself.

Yes it will be hard on her in the short term, but it seems this is what she ultimately wanted for her children.", "Just like generational wealth, there is generational poverty that is inherited. This is make or break moment to get out of the poverty cycle. Unfortunately your mother has learned to short term thinking because of poverty, where to get next meal rent money etc. So long term thinking of getting higher education and that way finding well paying job in long run might even seem absurd to her since \"where would the next meal and rent come?\" NTA.

That is what parents are supposed to want for their children.  It was never your job to help support your family. What you've been doing the last few years for them was wonderful . Your mother should be grateful to you and the help that you've given . She should want you to do whatever you can to ensure you have a bright future. Go to school!", "Focus on killing it at school.

You will surely make something amazing out of yourself.", "It might be something for your mom to consider which part of the country will help her most with social services.
