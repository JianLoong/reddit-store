{"id": 19679, "submission_id": "149c11o", "title": "AITA for \"ruining\" a birthday party because the planner disrespected me?", "selftext": "I (31F) was recently invited to a birthday dinner for a friend (30F). For context, my friend has a young daughter (3) that lives at her home with her. I am not a child-friendly person. I don\u2019t like the societal pressure to have and give up my life for them. I don\u2019t like being expected to give up my happiness for theirs. I don\u2019t like having to watch what I say and do in front of them and when they have tantrums and meltdowns, I get overstimulated and being around them is just generally very tiring for me. The party was a surprise party being organized by a mutual friend \u201cHannah\u201d (31F). Hannah is very well aware of my feelings about children and when she asked me to help out with the party, I said I would but reminded her how I feel about kids and asked her to make sure that our friend\u2019s daughter was somewhere else for the day, maybe at a friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s house, or our friend's husband could take her somewhere. She said \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d, so I assumed this meant she\u2019d take care of it. She assigned me to bring the decorations and drinks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe morning of the party, I asked her to clarify that our friend\u2019s daughter was out of the house, and Hannah said that the child would be there, and that we have \u201cno right to ask the kid to leave her own house\u201d. I was baffled that Hannah was prioritizing this kid (who obviously doesn't own the house) over our friend being able to have fun with her adult friends and blatantly ignoring my boundary, so I didn\u2019t go. Right before the party, Hannah and our other friends kept trying to call and text me, but their spamming was making me very anxious, so I put my phone on do not disturb and went to the movies. Now, my phone is being blown up from them about how I \u201cruined\u201d the party by not bringing the things I had signed up to bring or by letting anyone know I wasn\u2019t going ahead of time. I suppose I could have dropped the supplies off or let them know that I wouldn\u2019t be going so they could have time to replace the decorations and drinks, but I didn\u2019t want to engage with them in that moment because their spamming was stressing me out, and they put themselves in this situation by disregarding my boundary.

Adults need to communicate a little better. Once you found out the little girl would be there, that was your chance to opt out. Could have even made an excuse like getting a headache/backache/covid/herpes/whatever.

What right to do you have to be in the home that a child resides in? She has WAY more right to be there than you and is probably more mature. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna lead a lonely lonely life.

For context, my friend has a young daughter (3) that lives at her home with her. I am not a child-friendly person. I don\u2019t like the societal pressure to have and give up my life for them. I don\u2019t like being expected to give up my happiness for theirs. I don\u2019t like having to watch what I say and do in front of them and when they have tantrums and meltdowns, I get overstimulated and being around them is just generally very tiring for me. The party was a surprise party being organized by a mutual friend \u201cHannah\u201d (31F). Hannah is very well aware of my feelings about children and when she asked me to help out with the party, I said I would but reminded her how I feel about kids and asked her to make sure that our friend\u2019s daughter was somewhere else for the day, maybe at a friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s house. She said \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d, so I assumed this meant she\u2019d take care of it. She assigned me to bring the decorations and drinks.The morning of the party, I asked her to clarify that our friend\u2019s daughter was out of the house, and Hannah said that the child would be there, and that we have \u201cno right to ask the kid to leave her own house\u201d. I was baffled that Hannah was prioritizing this kid (who obviously doesn't own the house) over our friend being able to have fun with her adult friends and blatantly ignoring my boundary, so I didn\u2019t go. Right before the party, Hannah and our other friends kept trying to call and text me, but their spamming was making me very anxious, so I put my phone on do not disturb and went to the movies. Now, my phone is being blown up from them about how I \u201cruined\u201d the party by not bringing the things I had signed up to bring or by letting anyone know I wasn\u2019t going ahead of time. I suppose I could have dropped the supplies off or let them know that I wouldn\u2019t be going so they could have time to replace the decorations and drinks, but I didn\u2019t want to engage with them in that moment because their spamming was stressing me out, and they put themselves in this situation by disregarding my boundary.

Children are everywhere, you better get use to it or get over it. You have a lot of ovaries to demand your friends child isn't coming to the party. Hannah was right. You have no right to tell that child she can't be inside her own home. And I guarantee if your friend heard that you tried to kick her daughter out of the party she'd probably kick you out instead.
