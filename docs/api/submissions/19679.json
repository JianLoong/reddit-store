{"id": 19679, "submission_id": "149c11o", "title": "AITA for \"ruining\" a birthday party because the planner disrespected me?", "selftext": "I (31F) was recently invited to a birthday dinner for a friend (30F). For context, my friend has a young daughter (3) that lives at her home with her. I am not a child-friendly person. I don\u2019t like the societal pressure to have and give up my life for them. I don\u2019t like being expected to give up my happiness for theirs. I don\u2019t like having to watch what I say and do in front of them and when they have tantrums and meltdowns, I get overstimulated and being around them is just generally very tiring for me. The party was a surprise party being organized by a mutual friend \u201cHannah\u201d (31F). Hannah is very well aware of my feelings about children and when she asked me to help out with the party, I said I would but reminded her how I feel about kids and asked her to make sure that our friend\u2019s daughter was somewhere else for the day, maybe at a friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s house, or our friend's husband could take her somewhere. She said \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d, so I assumed this meant she\u2019d take care of it. She assigned me to bring the decorations and drinks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe morning of the party, I asked her to clarify that our friend\u2019s daughter was out of the house, and Hannah said that the child would be there, and that we have \u201cno right to ask the kid to leave her own house\u201d. I was baffled that Hannah was prioritizing this kid (who obviously doesn't own the house) over our friend being able to have fun with her adult friends and blatantly ignoring my boundary, so I didn\u2019t go. Right before the party, Hannah and our other friends kept trying to call and text me, but their spamming was making me very anxious, so I put my phone on do not disturb and went to the movies. Now, my phone is being blown up from them about how I \u201cruined\u201d the party by not bringing the things I had signed up to bring or by letting anyone know I wasn\u2019t going ahead of time. I suppose I could have dropped the supplies off or let them know that I wouldn\u2019t be going so they could have time to replace the decorations and drinks, but I didn\u2019t want to engage with them in that moment because their spamming was stressing me out, and they put themselves in this situation by disregarding my boundary.

Adults need to communicate a little better. Once you found out the little girl would be there, that was your chance to opt out. Could have even made an excuse like getting a headache/backache/covid/herpes/whatever.

What right to do you have to be in the home that a child resides in? She has WAY more right to be there than you and is probably more mature. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna lead a lonely lonely life.

For context, my friend has a young daughter (3) that lives at her home with her. I am not a child-friendly person. I don\u2019t like the societal pressure to have and give up my life for them. I don\u2019t like being expected to give up my happiness for theirs. I don\u2019t like having to watch what I say and do in front of them and when they have tantrums and meltdowns, I get overstimulated and being around them is just generally very tiring for me. The party was a surprise party being organized by a mutual friend \u201cHannah\u201d (31F). Hannah is very well aware of my feelings about children and when she asked me to help out with the party, I said I would but reminded her how I feel about kids and asked her to make sure that our friend\u2019s daughter was somewhere else for the day, maybe at a friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s house. She said \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d, so I assumed this meant she\u2019d take care of it. She assigned me to bring the decorations and drinks.The morning of the party, I asked her to clarify that our friend\u2019s daughter was out of the house, and Hannah said that the child would be there, and that we have \u201cno right to ask the kid to leave her own house\u201d. I was baffled that Hannah was prioritizing this kid (who obviously doesn't own the house) over our friend being able to have fun with her adult friends and blatantly ignoring my boundary, so I didn\u2019t go. Right before the party, Hannah and our other friends kept trying to call and text me, but their spamming was making me very anxious, so I put my phone on do not disturb and went to the movies. Now, my phone is being blown up from them about how I \u201cruined\u201d the party by not bringing the things I had signed up to bring or by letting anyone know I wasn\u2019t going ahead of time. I suppose I could have dropped the supplies off or let them know that I wouldn\u2019t be going so they could have time to replace the decorations and drinks, but I didn\u2019t want to engage with them in that moment because their spamming was stressing me out, and they put themselves in this situation by disregarding my boundary.

You don\u2019t have to want children, but you\u2019re discriminating against the most vulnerable group of people. You were a child once, were you constantly kicked out of the house and made to feel like a burden?", "Obviously YTA.", "Uh...YTA OP, what the hell?  \n\n\nI can understand not wanting to socialise with children but you talk about this child as though you are deathly allergic and your friends are being really mean by not capitulating to your profoundly arrogant request. Baffled that you think you have the right to request a child not be in its home.  \n\n\nFurthermore you abandoned your assigned duties and tasks to your friend group without saying a word to anybody! For the sole reason that your unreasonable boundaries were not respected.  \n\n\n>I don\u2019t like the societal pressure to have and give up my life for them. I don\u2019t like being expected to give up my happiness for theirs.  \n\n\nWHAT are you talking about?

They are obviously going to be welcome at their parent's party. You don't have a right to set a boundary that involves turfing a child out of their own house (and no, the fact that they don't personally pay rent doesn't mean it isn't their house!). Also, the person organising the party doesn't have the right to arrange childcare away from home without her parent's permission - which can't be got because it's a *surprise* party.\n\n\"You'll be fine\" is admittedly dismissive as a response, but makes it clear that you are expected to control yourself.

Not because you hate kids, not because you skipped the party, but because you didn't follow through on bringing the things that you said you would handle.

I don\u2019t like kids at all, but you can\u2019t remove a child from their own home because you don\u2019t like them, that\u2019s ridiculous.", "YTA, your friend, sorry, I mean EX-FRIEND is right. What right do you have to keep a kid out of her own home? Wait, none, a guest has basic boundaries in someone else's home, you do not get to decide whether a child is in their own home or not because you can't deal with kids, and then throw a temper tantrum let literally EVERYONE of them down. Grow up.", "Literally my first time ever responding on Reddit and felt compelled to because wow absolutely YTA. I don\u2019t generally like kids either so I would normally be slightly biased towards similar feelings but jeez; you definitely should have at least dropped the stuff off, in addition to telling them you\u2019re not going. Even then you\u2019d still be an asshole. Even going in then faking a migraine or something to leave early would have at least been somewhat of a decent compromise. Your apparent lack of social cues must be something more than just you\u2019re a bit of a garbage person.", "You're a bit of an AH here because you accepted this role knowing full well the likelihood of having to deal with societal pressures.  And if you claim you honestly didn't know then that's also your fault because that's unrealistic and you should have expected these types of pressures.  I also suffer from social anxieties and part of managing our own stressors is simply knowing and/or expecting when they'll come up.", "YTA. This isn't \"not liking children.\" This is active dislike so strong it's pathological. \n\nBy expecting the child to leave her own house, you also expected the father to not be at his wife's birthday party. \n\nChrissakes, you really need to take a deep look at your issues and maybe get some therapy because that level of anxiety, where you ghost everyone and your responsibilities over some texts and being called out, is not normal.", "YTA. I am child free and also not a big fan of kids as I can also get overstimulated when around them. But if you agree to help out with a party at the child's home, you help out. You dont just ghost everyone and ignore their calls and texts. I'm finding it hard to believe that you were the adult in this situation as this is such childlike behavior its laughable.", "YTA it\u2019s a child not poisonous gas. Do you even like your friend?", "YTA and you have to grow up. You tried to remove her daughter from her birthday celebration essentially for yourself. Then when you were aware you chose not to go AND still didn't feel the need to at least inform them that the items you were bringing would not be there.

All you had to do is drop off the supplies and politely beg off with something vague and leave.", "YTA. You agreed to provide things for the party and you ghosted. If you didn't want to go because the child was there,  be an adult and say that. The planner didn't disrespect you. This wasn't about you at all. It was someone else's party and you ruined it for a petty reason. You definitely shouldn't have let the planners think you were bringing things and then just drop the ball. You should have communicated so that someone else could have brought the supplies that you'd agreed to provide.", "Given how awful you appear to be I'm shocked anyone trusted you to do anything.  What a bizarre post.  What massive entitlement and genuinely shitty behavior. \n\nFyi, your anxiety with them blowing up your phone is actually more or less your conscience letting you know you fucked up.  You should learn to understand that and use that as a way to improve your behavior.  But no you just turned off your phone and took care of yourself.\n\nYou need serious therapy. Plenty of people don't want kids and that's absolutely fine.  Expecting them to be stashed away for your benefit is absolutely psychotic.", "Yes YTA and a horrible friend!!\nNo worries though..\nI'm sure you'll have a loT LESS friends after this very childlike TANTRUM you threw. \nSmh", "YTA. The priority was for your friend whose birthday it was. Your friend has a child and they wished for that child to be included. You were not disrespected but you were disrespectful to your friend, jer child and the planner by not either dropping off the supplies or having then pick them up.", "YTA. It was one child in a party full of adults. They aren't like cats that gravitate to the person who hates them most. You could have dropped off the items and left. Who expects acquaintances to provide off site childcare during a surprise party??", "YTA. You aren't a priority over someone's child. You are a bad friend for not supplying what you committed to. I laughed hard when I read you were 'disrespected'! You were the only one being disrespectful.", "OMG YES - YTA  \nI think you need to re-read your post and if you don't think there is something wrong there then you have a TON of other problems you should be focusing on.", "I\u2019m sorry but you took this too far, I get being child free and struggle with overstimulation/difficulties but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.\n\nI\u2019m not big fan of kids, can only manage so much but that\u2019s not the kids fault, they are innocent in general and need to be treated fairly and in age appropriate way. I have friends with kids who i spend time with both and choose to treat them with respect and be aware of what I say isn\u2019t inappropriate and take responsibility when I\u2019m not. \n\nYou cannot expect your friend not to have her daughter present at party at her home. You needed to be clear about if her daughter being there as it is her home not yours. Once realised, if you choose not to go, then you should have dropped things off and left it at that.", "finding children stressful is a very good reason not to have any. It's not a good reason to expect someone else's child to be removed from their own home. For you to have expected that in the first place is completely unreasonable, and then to not drop off the supplies, or even answer your phone, was childish. yta.", "Definitely the asshole. I'm surprised you even have friends.... maybe you don't now lol.", "You\u2019re 1000% TAH and reek of entitlement.

That is so wrong.", "YTA. Everything you described is literally just basic manors. It's normal to adjust your behavior depending on the surroundings. That's why people tend not to pound shots and twerk at work, talk on the phone during weddings etc. \nExpecting a resident of the home to be removed to cater to you is a level on entitlement that's truly astounding. And that's before you even touch on failure to uphold your end of the duties. \n\nYou and the 3yr old probably have more in common than you think. At least as far as emotional regulation and understanding interpersonal relationships.", "Massive YTA \n\nI'll be very surprised if you still have friends after this", "YTA and you know it with the passive aggressive \"I suppose I could have dropped the supplies off...\" \n\nYou don't run shit or dictate who is in anyone's home but your own. Get over yourself.", "YTA big time.", "YTA.  Planner/friend did not disrespect you, she just enforced boundaries.   She even gave you a job that would have you surrounded by adults.   While you would have been well within your right to bail if asked to do childcare at said party, you failed hard when you asked host to disinvite her own daughter.  Seriously, we get that not everyone wants to raise children, but you've gone seriously extreme not wanting them to be at the same event as you.", "Info: are you on the spectrum by any chance?\n\nThe way you express yourself and the rigid thinking has me thinking that is the situation here but want to check before making a judgement", "YTA. It's astounding how you typed all that out and still didn't realize you were TA. For starters, not everyone has to live their life catered to you. Children are everywhere, you better get use to it or get over it. You have a lot of ovaries to demand your friends child isn't coming to the party. Hannah was right. You have no right to tell that child she can't be inside her own home. And I guarantee if your friend heard that you tried to kick her daughter out of the party she'd probably kick you out instead. The fact that you refused to come despite knowing people were counting on you to bring things just shows how self centered you truly are. You put your feelings before your friends on HER birthday.
