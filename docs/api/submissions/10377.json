He trudges around all the time despite having ZERO reason to be tired, doesn\u2019t answer simple questions, and has this dumbass mopey look on all the time. I\u2019m really getting sick of this new attitude.\n\nI came home after a long day of work today, and my boyfriend didn\u2019t even go to work today at all, he called in sick. And he\u2019s not even sick, he literally just slept all day.\n\nThe dishes were still in the sink, and he was just sleeping around on the couch, and there was no dinner ready. I was so pissed off because I just had a long day, so I went over to him and screamed at him to get off his ass and make dinner. I know this may have been harsh, but I\u2019m sick of him acting so useless.\n\nThen, he had the nerve to start crying, and I told him to stop the drama and please just make some food and take care of the dishes so we can eat. He agreed and finally did so.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not super proud of my outburst, he\u2019s been pushing my limits lately and he needs to do his job. Since the dinner fiasco,  he\u2019s gone all cold with me and has stopped talking to me even more than usual, which I think is a slight overreaction when he caused the entire situation initially.

Mental health issues are just as serious as physical health ones.  Just like you wouldn't get angry and yell at a cancer patient for laying around, fatigued, about not making dinner, you shouldn't do the same for someone that may be suffering from some extreme mental illness that manifests in actual physical symptoms.", "The dude sounds depressed. Maybe you should check in with him instead of yelling at him. YTA", "Not a physician but the behavior you are describing sounds like classic depressive symptoms. Depression isn't just about feeling sad, but an overall loss of vitality that trigger a physiological response that feeds back into a very bad spiral. \n\nIt \\*is\\* really frustrating when your partner is going through a depressive episode.  It \\*is\\* frustrating to feel like you are the only one working hard. And it is the case that depression doesn't magically erase the responsibility to try to be a good partner. And it doesn't sound as if your boyfriend is recognizing this. \n\nHowever...\n\n... suppose that instead of depression, he had a badly broken leg that was causing him a lot of pain. How would you feel about your response then? I think we'd both agree that in that case YTA. Just because his pain is invisible doesn't make it not real. Of course there \\*are\\* also scenarios where it is just laziness or entitlement at play, which would change my judgment.\n\nBottom line- you need to apologize for how you behaved- but you also need to have a serious talk about why he is feeling the way he is feeling and what he can do with your support to dig himself out of the hole he is in.", "Yeah this is not a safe space for the boyfriend to explore what exactly is happening with him. YIKES!", "YTA\n\nSeems like a rather toxic relationship. Your boyfriend shows signs of depression and you lack any sort of empathy whatsoever.

Encourage him to talk to a mental health specialist to get properly evaluated.  \n\n\nAs for yourself:  YTA.  Your attitude was never 'Someone I care about is not acting himself, and seems to be hurting, is there anything I can do to help?', but instead was 'Someone I am sharing a space with is not pulling his weight and it is affecting me, he needs to get his crap together'.  Your attitude is immature, self centered, and, frankly, awful.    \n\n\nI am hoping that this is a fake post.

This does not help and just makes you feel even more like a failure. \n\nAdvice: speak to your boyfriend!", "YTA and this reminds me of that other post of a guy who \"showed his lazy gf how to properly wash dishes\".

You do realize what you're calling lazy is classic signs of depression?  And if this is the way you're constantly treating him, screaming at him like this.. it's not going to get better.

Be empathetic and caring.", "INFO: have you tried communicating about why he's acting this way recently?", "YTA. You have ZERO empathy for him. You don't ask if anything is wrong.

The right way to handle this would be to sit down and talk to him about what he's struggling with, and then figure out how you can be supportive.

Sounds like the BF is suffering from depression. Helping him get some help is the right move. Screaming like a banshee is the wrong move and makes you a first class asshole.", "You might be the AH.  It sounds like your boyfriend is suffering from depression and needs help.  If that's the case, yeah, YTA and you need some empathy lessons.", "YTA this is classic depression, and your abuse is surely a contributing factor. Makes no mistake, the behavior you displayed is ABSOLUTELY abusive.", "YTA... very much TA.  He's obviously depressed.  He needs to seek help, preferably away from YOU.  You are obviously making him feel worse with your verbal abuse.", "YTA. I'm in agreement with many of the responses that are pointing out what are very obvious signs of depression. This is based on personal experience, I'm not a medical professional. And sure, maybe there are some potential other reasons for these behaviors but an ounce of empathy might go a long way & maybe just actually asking him if he could use your support in some way? And calling his expression a 'dumbass mopey look'? C'mon, that's just downright mean.", " YTA!!! \nHave you considered that your boyfriend may be dealing with a wave of depression? Instead of sitting down and asking him what's wrong you yell and belittle him. If this isn't normal behavior then that means that something is wrong. Try having some apathy and sit down and talk to your boyfriend. You seem like a gem.....", "Thank God this is fake, because there\u2019s no way someone with this little emotional awareness and sympathy exist.

That is real and serious and should be your first concern by far. YTA", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that his behavior is more than just him \"being lazy\"? It sounds like he's deeply depressed. Sleeping all the time, never smiling, no energy...all of those are symptoms of depression.", "Lmao IF this is real you are of course the asshole and need to dump your boyfriend because you obviously hate him and do not care enough about him to inquire into WHy his behavior might have changed and idk, help him?", "This sounds like bait to me, but on the off-chance it's real, it sounds like clinical depression or even a physical health issue, making you squarely in the \"YTA\" category.", "Have you talked to him to see if anything is bothering him.  This could be a sign of depression.", "YTA and your bf deserves better than you.  Hopefully he gets help for what clearly seems like depression then dumps your uncaring ass to the curb.", "I bet OP will be deleting her post.  YTA if you don't see that he actually may need help.", "YTA. I hate it when people assume you have to have a reason to be tired. Sleeping all day is NOT normal.

He's undergone a drastic change, dissociates, lacks energy, has trouble completing everyday tasks, and sleeps all day.  Instead of talking to him about your concerns and urging him to see a medical professional, you decide to verbally abuse him to the point of tears and then make him do work for you.  Then, to plop a shit cherry on your shit sundae, you insult and belittle anyone who who dares to point out the very obvious possibility of a mental health crisis.\n\nDo you even care about this person as a human being, or do you just keep him around so he can clean and cook for you?  Because this is not how decent people treat their loved ones, just FYI.", "YTA. \n\nCompassion goes a long way. It sounds like he is having a bout of depression and you don't sound like you are being at all a supportive partner. Not everyone understands depression, but let me tell you as someone who has suffered most of my life with it, you making someone feel worse by yelling at them could be the very thing that pushes them over the edge. \n\nYou say he doesn't answer \"simple\" questions. What are these simple questions? Because when I'm deep in a pit of despair, I can barely function let alone answer stupid questions being asked by someone that's also yelling at me and not being empathetic. \n\nThat \"dumbass mopey look\" is the 12th leading cause of death in America today, so maybe work on not being such a bitch to someone struggling.", "YTA obviously something is going on with him and you could have been a LOT nicer about it, working out the stress you have from a long day at work on your partner is not ok", "Yta.

I understand your frustration, but you keep repeating that you don't like his \"new attitude\", yet seem really unwilling to have an actual conversation with him to find out what's causing said \"new attitude\". When someone's behavior changes drastically in a relatively short period of time, there's often something more behind it than a simple \"lazy streak\". If you love this man, then you should be willing to have an uncomfortable conversation and find out whether there's something going on with him that needs to be addressed. If it really is that he's just feeling \"lazy\" and if that's a dealbreaker for you, then that's understandable and you should be making moves to leave the relationship.

Find out why, if he is just being lazy discuss how it\u2019s upsetting you that he isn\u2019t helping out and that you need that to change. You became the massive asshole by charging in yelling at him and demanding he make you dinner.", "And I have clinical depression,\nYour boyfriend is showing clear cut signs\n\n\nDo a fucking google search OP\n\n\nact like you give a fuck", "You are a giant asshole. Sudden laziness is a depression symptom. And if my husband was suddenly sporting a mopey look on his face, it would break my heart, not piss me off. You\u2019re cold and uncaring. YTA.", "And have you ASKED him about this ? You may be his girlfriend but you\u2019re assuming he\u2019s okay , you don\u2019t actually know", "True that. Either way, total AH behaviour. Now OP is getting defensive and dramatic because people are talking about emotional abuse. Idk why she bothered posting here if this actually happened. Yikes on several fucking bikes.", "Exactly! Like I understand her frustration, but even then, you can solve more by asking him what's up then yelling at him. I can guarantee as someone who's gone through all those symptoms she mentioned that being yelled at only pushed me further down, when people genuinely acting like they care was a stepping stone to getting out of that dark place!", "Sure, electronics and social media are the issue\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, i immediately thought depression,  which I don't have, but it definitely could be these, too.  I have autoimmune disease and there are days I literally have no motivation or ability to do anything.  \n\n\nOp, yta. Maybe instead of getting mad at your partner thst you are supposed to love and care about, maybe ask what you can do to help him?", "Or the big C. Sudden tiredness (with or without a reason) should be taken seriously.  \n\n\nI had an aunt whose summer of sandbagging her family's house (lived on a flooding lake) coincide with her aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  She was exhausted in early summer but thought she had a good reason.  In mid-August that year, she finally got checked out.  She was diagnosed around Labor Day that year and gone by Halloween.", "Sorry I'll get down-voted soon because of all the YTA people here but just wanted to add that they do not know he's depressed and you shouldn't be expected to guess what's wrong with him. \n\nHe is an adult and if he can't pull his weight and wants you to take care of all the stuff in the house then he should at least communicate what's going on. \n\nHe can not expect to say nothing and do nothing and that you'll be there to make dinner and clean up after him.", "Nope, you can make your judgement but you can\u2019t make unfounded medical claims.", "I think he\u2019s seriously just on a lazy streak. Not everything is a mental health issue. Sometimes you need to\ntake responsibility for your actions as a grown adult.", "and a classic abuser!", "The fact that it is a change to his old personality and not something he has always done suggests something MAY be wrong", "Exactly. These chores are HIS responsibility so he needs to step up and pull his weight as an adult. I\u2019m not here to be his mommy. I want to be his girlfriend.", "You literally just had someone *in the medical field* agree that he was displaying symptoms of depression. Not to mention that suffering from the same symptoms myself and recognizing them in him is hardly unfounded. His behavior is proof that something more is going on.", "Oh, but we can make unfounded, negative judgments about your boyfriend, right? As long as we agree he\u2019s a lazy asshole and you\u2019re a poor thing that hitched to a losing wagon? So sensitive.\n\nAs someone who works as a mental health provider: he should get checked out.", "You seem to be...\n\nYTA", "You literally wrote a post specifically so that readers would point out the symptoms of depression. Why are you complaining that they are mentioning depression? You skillfully dropped all the \u201chints\u201d in your story so readers would find it.", "I know it might be hard feeling attacked and everyone saying YTA. Let\u2019s forget that for just a second, for all you know everyone on here is an AH, but maybe take what everyone is collectively saying that your BF is showing signs of depression as a way to engage him and view the situation from a different perspective. You might have had every right to yell at him at the end of a long day and then seeing someone just on the couch not doing anything, it\u2019s frustrating and we have all been there. But maybe there\u2019s a reason for his change in attitude and only you would know.", "Aren\u2019t you making unfounded medical claims by saying he\u2019s not depressed? Do you have a medical degree? Are you a psychiatrist? Given the way you\u2019ve approached this I am going to guess no (but apologies if you are\u2026) \n\nHow is your \u201cdiagnosis\u201d any more valid then someone here- because you know him? That\u2019s not exactly how things work", "i don\u2019t know how yelling at someone to the point that they cry and then calling them dramatic is supposed to NOT make you the asshole. YTA. \n\ni understand you\u2019re frustrated, but taking it out on your partner isn\u2019t okay. try to figure out what\u2019s behind the lazy streak and whether it\u2019s something you guys could work out or if it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you. \n\nessentially, please just talk to him and figure out what\u2019s going on instead of just assuming the worst of him only to escalate the situation. \n\nif you can\u2019t be compassionate to your boyfriend because you feel too frustrated with him, that\u2019s both something you need to work on and also figure out if it could also be a sign of incompatibility. not everyone responds to tough love, some prefer a more gentle approach yknow?\n\ni\u2019m also gonna add that what comes off as laziness isn\u2019t always just laziness, especially if it isn\u2019t normal behavior. i would also caution you to not entirely shrug off the idea that he has depression unless you\u2019ve actually been trained to understand how stigma plays into it and how to evaluate warning signs or symptoms. \n\nbeing close to someone doesn\u2019t preclude you from not being a medical professional, just as us being commenters doesn\u2019t preclude us from being entirely misinformed about the situation too.", "What do you think he would say if you asked him what was going on?", "\"Lazy streaks\" aren't usually accompanied by complete personality changes. I think you're being a little naive here. What's the harm in having an actual conversation with him about how differently he's been acting and asking him if everything is okay?", "\"Lazy\" is always a symptom of something. Healthy people don't call in and sleep all day. Furthermore, abusive people act like you did.", "God, you sound like a boomer who thinks they everyone just needs some \u2018tough love\u2019\n\nYou are the sort of person who yells at someone until they cry, and then insults them for crying, so it should be no surprise that you seem completely unaware of the concept of empathy.

Does he typically cry? Has he had a history of depression?", "This lazy streak you refer to. It's not a term I have ever heard or an idea that's known. I am 55, have had three children and have lived and had loads of experience yet not heard of this lazy streak' which you seem to imply just happens to anyone randomly. Where did you get this idea from?", "Oh shut up. You\u2019re baiting people with this shit full knowing you described depression exactly. I hope he leaves you.", "how are any of your complaints in your first paragraph related to being on a lazy streak lol?? What the hell does walking around like you\u2019re exhausted or not wanting to talk or looking sad all the time have to do with being lazy lmfao", "But what if it IS a mental health issue? Do you really want to take that chance? Are you gonna let him suffer because you think you\u2019re right? How are you gonna feel if you are wrong and he goes untreated and hurts himself.

I guess 9/11 is somehow my fault too?", "now who is being dramatic.", "even if you speak to him he is never going to admit to you that he is depressed.  look at how you talk to and about him, he doesn't trust you with that information. you just gonna call him lazy anyway so why open up to you about his problems. you have  \nzero empathy", "It's the sleeping all day that's the tell, though. A lazy person might neglect work and chores, but they wouldn't sleep all day if there weren't a reason. He probably cried and distanced himself instead of talking because he didn't think you'd understand.", "Verbal abuse is still abuse. As is emotional abuse. Have you tried sitting him down and having a calm and empathetic conversation with him regarding his recent \"laziness\".   \n\n\nJust because you aren't diagnosed with depression does not mean you do not have it. And it is likely that if your post is any indication of how you communicate with him, he isn't comfortable initiating a conversation where he talks about these things with you.   \n\n\nYes, not everything is a mental health issue and taking responsibility is important. But at the same time, there is a very real possibility that there ***is*** a mental health issue that he does not know how to deal with, and the better course of action is to sit down and have a non-judgmental conversation about it to get him the help he needs.", "honestly speaking, I won't be surprised, if that was the case\ud83e\udd23\n\nYou are at the mount everest of entitlment", "Aren\u2019t you just a histrionic little peach?", "Wow you are just a crap human being.

By now you should have figured out that you don\u2019t know everything.", "Lol. YTA. Either he has depression or you're trolling. If all you want is random people on the Internet to validate your awful behaviour, you came to the wrong place. \n\nHundreds of comments of \"bro has depression\" and all you have to reply with is denial, sarcasm, deflection, and insults.
