Just means he wasn't that much into you if this little incident made him leave completely. He is not an AH for feeling like being potentially branded as creepy, it can hurt  I think. You are definitely not an AH for not feeling safe with a virtual stranger.", "NTA he is upset that your reaction which is normal means you don't trust him??? A person you just met? He definitely showed he is not trustworthy.", "NTA. \n\n>acting like I didn't trust him. But also, I barely know him\n\nTrust has to be earned and established. In a scenario like this, blind trust would be a terrible idea. If he can't understand you wanting to protect yourself from someone you don't know that well, then you likely dodged a bullet.", "NTA. You dodged a bullet", "When I was dating I'd start every single date by telling him \"My friends are super protective and we have a whole group chat we use to make sure we all get home safe from dates, can I send them your picture and your full name so if I end up in a ditch they know who to come after?\"\n\nEvery guy I went out with cheerfully agreed, I offered to reciprocate as well.

Many, many men have no idea how some women live in constant fear, always on guard against being raped or murdered. It\u2019s just not on our radar or how most men go through the day.", "NTA.  Anyone who honestly cares about your safety shouldn\u2019t fault you for that.", "NTA. Unless you've known him since you were 5, there's no reason to be upset at you for being cautious.", "Nah. The people saying he is wrong for being offended are a little much.  It\u2019s not like he was some random. You had a mutual friend.  It\u2019s like suspecting someone might be a thief and covering your purse when they walk by. If you want to do it fine. It doesn\u2019t automatically make you an asshole. But the person walking by is allowed to be offended.", "NTA\n\nI can understand this guy being initially upset, but it he couldn't get over it, then that's a red flag.", "NTA.  His feelings are less important than you not getting raped.

She is now very cautious and apprehensive about the whole thing. She has a strict set of rules for the first dates, not limited to, but including sharing her location with me in real-time and specifically informing the guy about it as soon as he arrives. Now together with the rest of her safety demands it can be somewhat exhausting and even mildly insulting to the innocent guy in question.\n\nBut what she always says is, she would never date a guy who would be so put off by this anyways, so it is a good elimination method as well for her.\n\nTbh honest I understand that for some of the guys, the rules are just a bit too much for a first date, it would be for me too. But I completely get where she's coming from so I support her wholeheartedly and help if asked  ( like with the location sharing for example).

And if you feel you have to do that, why are you there?", "I had an almost identical experience, and the guy laughed it off as an understandable instinctive reaction. Because it was.

There are situations where nobody is wrong, and this is one of them.\n\nMaybe some of you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, but there is a cultural change occurring. Men are less willing to let themselves be judged for the contents of their pants. \n\nI get some men rape women, however the vast majority do not. Our whole lives we are given lectures with a message that leaves us feeling like we\u2019re inherently bad and need to work extra hard to control ourselves.\n\nI\u2019m sure this will get downvoted, but I don\u2019t care. Gender profiling is just as wrong as racial profiling.", "You ever walked up behind a woman after dark and she got startled?
