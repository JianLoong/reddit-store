A week later he informed me she had the tickets, and I asked him we we could discuss re-balancing the accommodation costs now that there was 3 of us coming - as it should now be a three way split.\n\nI was surprised that he responded with anger. As far as he was concerned the accommodation was paid for and it was wrong and greedy of me to expect money from his girlfriend. He told me that he was paying for the entire holiday for his girlfriend, so it was still going to be just him and me paying, so it was unfair of me to not pay for half. I told him that there's three adults, 3 people, three way split - if he chose to pay for his girlfriends third that was his choice and nothing to do with me.\n\nHe told me his girlfriend was going to buy me a cocktail to say thank you for the accommodation, but if I was going to insist on a split then I could forget it and buy my own \"damn cocktails\" as he couldn't beleive I was being so selfish.\n\nThe thing is, a cocktail is $15, and I was currently covering half her accommodation costs ~ $600. \n\nI don't think I was an asshole asking her/them to cover her share of the accommodation.

It doesn\u2019t mean either of you are wrong, but it\u2019s not an objective situation and heavily depends on perspective.\n\nRegardless, it sounds like this holiday is going to be pretty shit for you at this point.

You didn't tell him, \"I'm ok, as long as she pays her fair share\"  You said she was ok to come, waited for her to book her flight, and then asked for money refunded to you, that you were already planning on spending and had spent.

I said, \"Well, now that we'll be splitting bills 3 ways, I'll have a little money to put into savings.\" It was the only benefit I could see to her moving in. They argued that since they were sharing a bedroom, there would be no change to me... and so I should still be paying for half of everything. (And just like you, he would be paying everything, and she would essentially live with us for free.) I argued. We have one living room with one couch and one tv (which all belonged to me). I also had a small tv in my bedroom, he did not. So, would I be banished to my bedroom from now on because there's no room for me in my living room on my couch? Or would she sit silently in her room alone? We all get ready for work and prepare meals at the same time. One bathroom and one kitchen. I will be constantly inconvenienced by an additional person living here. If I don't receive some financial compensation, then she can't move in. \n\nThey were mad for a while, and he ended up paying 2/3rds of the bills. I saved some money and moved out within the year. It was rough for a while. I basically never left my room. I had to blow my hair dry in the living room while she took 40 minute showers. Some days, I had to leave for work without brushing my teeth because I couldn't access the bathroom.

Unless they are spending the majority of the time in the cabin and using the amenities (I'm assuming not because OP specified they're going to an island which they are presumably spending the majority of the vacation exploring), this is no different than if the GF hadn't joined. \n\nEtiquette would dictate that the girlfriend treat her to a meal/drinks as appreciation for tagging along on the trip, which she planned to. Food/car rental/activities should be split between the three and there is no indication in the post that it wouldn't be. Asking for a whole third of the cost for the cabin is incredibly tacky when she's barely inconveniencing her, boarding-wise. \n\nThe OP did clarify in comments that the girlfriend is being incredibly unreasonable in other aspects of the trip but for the post given, OP is an asshole for demanding the girlfriend basically subsidize her lodging when the friend effectively paid for his girlfriend already.", "I've been banned for disagreeing before lmfaooo", "The trip isn't currently broken down by \"rooms used,\" it's broken down by the number of adults going (and that was what OP had to clear with the host even to be able to bring the gf).", "I saw a comment referencing a comment from the OP (so take that with a grain of salt lol) that the gf and friend had requested that OP vacate the house a couple of times for them to be alone. That alone is completely unreasonable especially if the gf isn\u2019t paying for the housing.\n\nBut the gf only offered to buy OP A drink. I would be buying that lady every drink if I didn\u2019t have to pay for vacation housing.\n\nI still disagree that a single should pay the same for the house as a couple but to each their own. At least we agree on terms before buying airfare lol", "Lol at least we're giving them the power trip they need with the downvotes \ud83e\udd23 it's a nice service", "You are the one that started talking about shared amenities. If you are going to use shared amenities as a sticking point to justify a three way split then you have to break it down by usage. Usually rooms and other facilities are rented by sleeping quarters, with shared amenities being nice perks. Not by number of people and split. If you want to do a time analysis break down of amenities usage then you have to figure which is most to least used and move from there. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It's not as simple as \"Oh there are three people so we'll split it three ways. You wouldn't charge a person that was sleeping on a sofa the same as someone that was sleeping in their own room. That hardly seems a fair split. \ud83d\ude13", "K I can tell from the second sentence you're being unnecessarily mean and somehow I've triggered anger in you, a stranger, so I'm gonna protect myself and not bother reading the rest, but cheers!", "Yes, completely in my name.

If MF & GF are sharing one bed and OP still has the other, the sleeping arrangement doesn't change. Meals, on the other hand are a different story, OP shouldn't have to subsidize the additional cost of GF's meals, that should fall entirely on MF & GF. GF offering to buy a cocktail is especially shitty & insulting. She should at the least offer to pick up a meal. An owed drink should just be assumed and not actually need to be offered.", "Or how great would it be to announce that you have two other buddies who couldn\u2019t afford to come previously but since they only now need to cover airfare they can\u2019t wait xx", "NTA.

In 3rds may be a bit excessive because they are sharing a bed, but 60/40 is more fair than 50/50.\n\nIf somehow you end up going at 50/50, make sure they only get 1/2 the bathroom time and half of the amenities to share amongst themselves. Lol.", "NTA. Three adults using the home and resources in it means three people paying for it. Honestly, he should buy you out and you should go somewhere without him. They're going to be salty the whole time that you didn't want to foot the bill to vacation with a stranger.", "The friend and his girlfriend are the ones being selfish. I think you should find someone else to take the trip with. He may initially be angry about it, and it might cause some strain, but going through with the trip will probably be far worse. They can book their own vacation!", "NTA. But I would bail on the vacation and get a full refund for your share and then he has to pay the rest if he wants to go with her. They're going to treat you like third wheel and they're going to be cranky the entire time and just blow you off so you're going to be there by yourself as it is. You need to tell him that you are going to cancel move the reservation over to him but make sure he knows he has to pay or else they're going to probably end up canceling on them and he's going to lose all his money.", "Nta\n\nYou are in the right. Don\u2019t back down. The one mistake you made was not saying that you expected a three way split up front. Nevertheless - you are still letting them know in advance and you are in the right. They are trying to take advantage of you. Good thing he isn\u2019t your boy friend.", "Cancel completely! There will be a lot of awkwardness and drama, go on a fun vacation on your own.

NTAH.", "Even if the friend was to offer now to pay 2/3 the trip is still ruined because of the resentment which now Exists and the friend of op and new gf will both feel that since the \u00a3 has now been split evenly then op should be open to letting them have the room alone and gf being able to make decisions about their itinerary so really you are effed if they do pay and effed if they don\u2019t . Definitely take someone else or cancel xx", "NTA\n\nThey're taking advantage of you. You are subsidizing her vacation.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell her to shove that one drink far up her ass too if you don\u2019t get some better compensation. Stuff like this is why I\u2019m *glad* I\u2019m not close to people. Last trip I went on was a disaster in many ways. I now go solo. Not scared at all. I value my peace these days.", "YTA, a little bit. You are being greedy, and grasping. You will surely go far, but without many friends.", "So they take a bedroom and you take a bedroom? Asking for 1/3 is unfair, YTA.\n\nSome payment may be asked for but not 1/3", "Is it a two bedroom accommodation that you\u2019re splitting? If he and his gf stay at one bedroom what difference does it make in terms of dividing the cost?", "NTA.  Don't charge her because he sees his room (for the two of them) as 'paid for'.

Sorry you don't get a free cocktail lol", "NTA", "OP, do not allow them to take over your reservation unless your name gets completely removed.

It's safer for you to cancel, and if you're generous, send them a link where they can rebook.", "Different friend. That one was fine with splitting costs, but stonewalled everything and ended up he outright lied to me about some rather significant things. His girlfriend wasn't being difficult. She was never even told about needing to pre-plan and pre-book activities. He blamed her for not being able to make decisions, which prevented anything being booked while not even telling her that she needed to make some. It  was a rather awkward weekend, and we are no longer friends at a.", "At this point I'd just try to get a refund and let him pay for this little 'honeymoon phase' of a vacation with his new gf.
