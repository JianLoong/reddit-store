We split to cost 50/50.\n\n2 months before we are due to go, he meets someone and they commence dating. The holiday comes up, and understandably she was a bit uncomfortable with him coming with me. I was given an ultimation - either she comes or the entire holiday is called off. I didn't say yes immediately,, because I needed to check with the accommodation as the island has a limited number of guests allowed and I needed the okay from them first. My hesitation wasn't taken well, they thought I wasn't keen.\n\nI got back to them within 24 hours and said I'd gotten the all clear for his girlfriend to also come and she could book plane tickets for her. A week later he informed me she had the tickets, and I asked him we we could discuss re-balancing the accommodation costs now that there was 3 of us coming - as it should now be a three way split.\n\nI was surprised that he responded with anger. As far as he was concerned the accommodation was paid for and it was wrong and greedy of me to expect money from his girlfriend. He told me that he was paying for the entire holiday for his girlfriend, so it was still going to be just him and me paying, so it was unfair of me to not pay for half. I told him that there's three adults, 3 people, three way split - if he chose to pay for his girlfriends third that was his choice and nothing to do with me.\n\nHe told me his girlfriend was going to buy me a cocktail to say thank you for the accommodation, but if I was going to insist on a split then I could forget it and buy my own \"damn cocktails\" as he couldn't beleive I was being so selfish.\n\nThe thing is, a cocktail is $15, and I was currently covering half her accommodation costs ~ $600. \n\nI don't think I was an asshole asking her/them to cover her share of the accommodation. I hadn't even met her yet, but they thought I should cover her costs because it was already paid for.

The person she's dating should pay her expenses. If he wants to invite her it's fine, but he should be the one covering her expenses then, and not expect you to pay for half of it. Should you be paying for her plane tickets as well?

It doesn\u2019t mean either of you are wrong, but it\u2019s not an objective situation and heavily depends on perspective.\n\nRegardless, it sounds like this holiday is going to be pretty shit for you at this point. Even if they aren\u2019t salty during it, you\u2019re going to be the third wheel to a new couple and that is tedious even before you have a bunch of situations where they want to go off together. \n\nConsidering she\u2019s coming because she\u2019s uncomfortable with you, I have a feeling there\u2019s going to be an ongoing trend there and if they stick together, this might be the beginning of the end of that friendship. If it were me, I\u2019d just give them my half of the trip as a parting gift and go find something to do solo somewhere else. A lot of people aren\u2019t as happy to cut losses as I am though, so you could offer to sell your half to him at full or reduced cost, but to me, I\u2019d rather lose money that go on an unpleasant trip just because I paid for it.", "ESH - I dont think an even three way split is equitable since you have your own room but she should be contributing somehow, wether its her paying or him.", "NAH - yet.  If the girlfriend is staying in the same room as her SO, then what are the extra expenses for bringing her along?  Is there a per-person fee?  If not, then I am actually leaning toward their view that she should not have to pick up 1/3 of the cost.  Having said that, I think she should chip in some as it will be different with her around.", "Jesus christ. When shit like this happens, you split the bill equal. I'm guessing your friend and gf are paying their share, and telling you that the friend is covering for the gf. This is shitty af.", "ESH. He's unreasonable to expect a 50/ 50 split, but you should have brought that up before he bought her plane ticket.", "NTA for asking, although this should maybe have been discussed prior to her booking flights.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t like you have separate hotel rooms, this is a shared accommodation thing, so in my mind they should have expected it. I\u2019d maybe say and equal 3-way split isn\u2019t entirely fair though, as you still have a room all to yourself, but there should definitely be a contribution on the GF\u2019s part to cover the shared amenities.", "ESH\u2014 you booked a 2 bedroom house, she isn\u2019t getting her own room, so I do not think it\u2019s reasonable to expect the accommodations to be split 3 ways - if a third friend was coming and crashing on a couch, that\u2019s a different story- but she should contribute in someway- maybe grocery shop for the week when y\u2019all get there or plan a fun outing or 2 for everyone -", "ESH.

You are going 50/50 and he and his partner  will be be in one room and you will be in the other.  He has paid his share.

I think a 3-way split is fair, yes they are sharing a room but you aren't paying for just where you sleep, there is the rest of the cabin common space and always being around this new person. I have to think a two bedroom island cabin is not that big. For sure a drink is not the same as paying some of the cabin cost, maybe not a third but definitely something significant (if you would still go, I wouldn't)   \n\n\nI agree too on trying to change this trip. There's no way you could go as originally planned, even if you wanted to, because of new GF. 50/50 is not fair, and even if you changed your mind and compromised about this, you'd be the third wheel with a brand new relationship.

Yes, if you had all booked at the same time, it would have been appropriate to split 3 ways. If a partner comes in after the fact, I would not necessarily expect them to pay a third.
