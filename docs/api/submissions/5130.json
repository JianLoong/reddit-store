Just set the record straight the first chance you get.", "I want to say NAH, but that doesn't mean you did nothing at all wrong. You just aren't a complete A.\n1. You are wrong for lying to him. Not because he has trust issues, you didn't know about that and weren't lying to be malicious, but you just shouldn't lie to people in general.\n2. However, I do understand your reasoning for not wanting to say your phone was dead, this was justified.

Just a \"hey, I'm sorry but something has been on my mind since our last date, I said something I shouldn't have and wanted to clear it up so that everything is true between us.\" Tell him you do feel bad for lying, but he was a stranger to you at the time and you need to protect yourself too.", "~~Y T A.~~  NTA.\n\nEDIT:  Sorry when you said \"girls will understand\"  I thought you meant girls will understand that phones die but guys will not.

It almost a guarantee lie that will be found out and it\u2019s a bad set up to a relationship. I usually say I turned my phone off for dates because they are distracting.

You lied so easily and effortlessly. Its a red flag. I get the safety factor but making up relations, it's a bit much and I would wonder if you lied all the time.", "I feel like E S H; this was a blind date set up by a friend, who I assume knows this guy and trusts him enough to get you two together. Just for that, I don't know why you'd lie specifically about having sisters. You could always say that you wanted to focus on the date instead of social media or preserve your phone battery. However, I do totally understand never being too safe; it seems odd that your date would bring up his trust issues in this specific instance, but the most you can do is explain why you lied and hope it goes over well.", "YTA and I'll tell you my reasoning. If you would lie about such an insignificant thing (your phone was dead and that was a reason to lie?? Makes no sense!), then you definitely are likely to lie about more important things. Someone with trust issues is going to have problems with this, especially with you lieing on your very first date.\n\nThe only thing I can think of as to why you would feel you needed to lie about your phone being dead is for safety reasons. Still doesn't make sense. This wasn't a date from an app where no one knows who you are with. This was a friend of a friend. They knew who and where you were.", "Just once up with fake names. Keeping track of letters is ridiculous in a story.", "YTA. I wouldn't want to be with someone who lies about the most irrelevant shit. It shows you're probably a compulsive liar.", "NAH I don't think you two will have a future, but that's not because of the lie itself but about your past. He has trust issues, which is valid. But your instinct to lie to defend yourself is nothing you can control in such a situation. I sometimes struggle with this behavior myself and it's routed in my childhood. No one is at fault, but it will be hard for you to start some kind of relationship because he will always fear this instinct of you and question your statements.", ">I didn't see another option.\n\nWhat do you mean, 'you didn't see another option?'

Your lying threshold is pretty low.", "This is so insane I can\u2019t believe the not the asshole verdicts.  A guy who was set up by a friend, who was requesting Instagram friendship?

Not telling someone you just met that you\u2019re vulnerable (can\u2019t call someone for help) isn\u2019t the sin you seem to think it is.\n\nETA: This goes for all genders. Do not let strangers know you\u2019re in a vulnerable position. My guy friends share their locations when they go out on dates and I did too- I would 100% advise them to lie if their phone was dead. This isn\u2019t a gender thing, but man you have to be obtuse if you can\u2019t recognize the danger of a woman saying \u201cno\u201d to a man.
