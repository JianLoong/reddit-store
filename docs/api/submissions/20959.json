I have not met my bfs friends yet but they know what I look like because my bf showed them pictures. They showed my bf the account and my bf called me immediately to tell me about it. I haven't used tinder in over a year and tinder is supposed to delete inactive accounts after 7 days, so i knew it wasnt mine. His friend also messaged with the account that weekend but I was with my bf watching a movie at that exact time so my bf didn't really believe the account was mine either. \nBut his friends weren't convinced that i wasnt cheating. I could hear them yelling things through the phone like \"Make that b*tch prove herself!\" \"You're gf is a wh*re!\"  along with other really degrading names.  My bf told them to shut up as I was on the verge of tears. \n I went on FaceTime w all of them while the friend messaged the account. They made me show my hands and my phone on the video call the whole time. The catfisher messaged back and I was proven innocent. \nNone of them apologized to me. They only apologized to my bf which felt even more disrespectful.\nApparently, those friends are hosting a party this weekend and my bf wants me to meet the group for the first time. But I don't want anything to do with them until they apologize to me for calling me names. My bf understands but also says that it would mean a lot if I could at least give his friends another chance since they were actually just doing their best to support him since he has been cheated on in the past.

Why does your boyfriend have such disgusting friends? That\u2019s concerning. \n\nSounds like a really uncomfortable situation you\u2019d be entering into. You have to decide if you want to give them a chance to apologize in person, or stand your ground and only go if they apologize first. But that might cause issues too if they see you as a problem. LET ME BE CLEAR, they are most definitely massive assholes, but if you want to stay with your bf and keep the peace, you gotta figure out what you\u2019re comfortable with. And no matter what, they owe you that apology the next time they see you, or your bf needs to put them in line.", "If my \u201c friends \u201c did that to my girlfriend they are no longer my friends. I understand being worried your friend may be getting cheated on but instantly jumping to conclusions and then not apologizing afterwards. There bad friends", "NTA but why is your boyfriend still friends with these people after they humiliated you like that?", "NTA stand your ground. You humoured them and went so far to prove you were innocent, the least they can do is apologise. Red flag that your BF doesn't think they owe you an apology", "INFO. Have you considered that one of them made the account? \n\nTheir gleeful gang up is suspicious to me.", "OMG, NTA.  \"Make that b*tch prove herself\"??? WTF?  No, they wanted him to prove yourself to THEM... Your bf says he trusts you, and they try to convince him otherwise, while calling you dehumanizing names.  I can't believe your bf is still friends with these walking shit piles, or that he agreed to subject you to all of that.", "Well, I think you know the answer to this one. Never, ever, under any circumstances should you break bread with these appalling people. If your bf wants to continue bring friends with them you can't stop him but you should treat it as a major red flag. \n\nNTA", ">My bf understands but also says that it would mean a lot if I could at least give his friends another chance since they were actually just doing their best to support him\n\nOh hell no ! His friends should have given you a chance and they should at least apologise to you !\n\nNTA. They were right to be suspicious but wrong to insult you ! They can apologise to you by phone, invite you personally to the party and apologise irl there. They have to do the work, that's their responsibility.", "NTA. Even if you get an apology you shouldn't have anything to do with them. It wouldn't be sincere and they sound like awful people.\n\n>I could hear them yelling things through the phone like \"Make that btch prove herself!\" \"You're gf is a whre!\" along with other really degrading names\n\nWhat kinds of people behave like that?\n\n>I went on FaceTime w all of them while the friend messaged the account. They made me show my hands and my phone on the video call the whole time.\n\nThose kinds of people.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to associate with people who called you such derogatory names, even if they do apologize for it - you\u2019re not required to forgive them and move on. This entire scenario is honestly none of their business, even if the account was yours. If you don\u2019t want to go, then you shouldn\u2019t go. Don\u2019t give up your voice, or your comfort bc your significant other has asked you to. If anything, I think your bf is the AH for even asking you to go, and for not advocating his friends to apologize to you.", "NTA - so many red flags! I had to legit scroll up to make sure we were taking about adults and not middle schoolers. Why is your boyfriend friends with such disgusting and disrespectful guys? Why would he feed into their BS and even calm you in the first place. He knew where exactly you were when the person responded. That should have immediately switched their focus to let\u2019s report this fake account instead of let\u2019s kill the witch. You shouldn\u2019t have to prove yourself and you should examine your relationship for other red flags.", "They should apologize to you and your bf should expect that from them! But they only protected your bf, I would like to know if friend of mine found something like that about my husband.", "NTA\n\nthey should definitely apologize and it\u2019s a major red flag that your bf doesn\u2019t see a problem and isn\u2019t making them. I wouldn\u2019t want to meet those people after something so degrading", "They owe you an apology,no doubt about that,maybe your bf should talk to them about it,the insults sounded exessive but he already got cheated on and the friends were protective and overly provocative in that regard so that your bf doesn't get hurt to that degree again.\n\nStill think NAH", "Maybe if you show up, you'll get the apology you are looking for.\n\nThey didn't know you, they only knew what they thought they saw, and their reaction isn't really that unusual to someone trying to cheat on their friend. That said, you are owed an apology once they found out you were innocent, and wanting it before you meet them is your prerogative.\n\nBut, like most communication issues it's best sorted out face to face, where a short conversation can resolve the issue one way or another.\n\nI don't think YTA if you don't go without that apology, but I think you're missing out on the chance to repair the relationship. BF should be demanding said apology, to you, regardless, but that's another issue.", "nta... but remember... they were protecting someone you love. without them meeting you you shouldnt take it personally. Its sweet they were looking out for him.\n\nI would advise you meet them, but let them know you want them to get to know who you are and that you deserve an apology, without anymosity or anger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also ur bf is kind of an ass and his friends are really reallyyyyy shitty and misogynistic people, stand your ground and whatever happens, happens. Please know that you have every right to feel violated this really sucks.", "NTA. They should have apologized to you, and your boyfriend not enforcing that apology is passive acceptance of their behavior. \n\nBeyond that, your boyfriend is trying to get you to disregard your own feelings on the matter and attend anyway in order to appease him. He clearly doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal that they didn\u2019t bother to apologize to you. To him, his buddies were just looking out for his best interest, and the fact that they hurt you in the process is perhaps unfortunate but overall acceptable collateral damage. \ud83d\udea9 \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d break up with him over this.", "NTA what the actual F!?! You are not teenagers. Why are all of his friends making up fake tinder, and then trying to break you up? Why did they feel so comfortable being completely misogynistic to you? Why did your boyfriend not support you or shut down his friends? You literally had to SHOW YOUR HANDS!?! Is this the kind of partner you desire? Someone who would let his own insecurities put you in such a situation? You will always be on the defensive with him and his friends. This entire thing is a forest of red flags.", "NTA. Their behaviour is absolutely disgusting.", "NTA, fuck those nerds. Its called human decency, and they obviously didn't learn that growing up.", "Idk about that but I don't want to point fingers without any real evidence. I think they're just misogynistic in a \"All women are snakes\" kind of way.", "They didn't just tell him, they demanded proof even though he'd already said it couldn't have been her since she was with him watching a movie at the time the messages were sent, then went on to call her derogatory and dehumanizing things.  All of that was unnecessary and cruel.", "If you post Y-T-A, it registers as your judgement being that she was the ah here... If you don't think that, I would change it.", "No no no, there is a difference between looking out for a friend and calling her a whore ! That's not sweet.\nThey should apology and OP has the right to be angry.", "i dont know... they are young and over reacted.... insults about a complete stranger for me usually hold no wieght. If they knew her and met its another story,.. in thier minds its an abstract thing attacking thiwer friend.\n\nop does deserve an apology,.. just saying she shouldnt take it so personally and should consider the intent.\n\nWhat would be creepy and AH behavior is trying to go out with her and not saying anything...If this was reversed would this harsh opinion still be the same? What if her friends found her boyfriends profile on tinder and and told her to dump that gigalo..that piece o shit player... dump his fucking ass..... Would people feel the same way? I seriously doubt it.", "OP is young too, why should she be the bigger person ?\n\nYes if it was reverse and her friends didn't apologise people would think the same way.\n\nExcept women are more used to do emotional labor and apologise. That's exactly why you expect OP to \"not take it personally\" (emotional work) while saying the boyfriend's friends are young and yada yada (it's ok they don't have to do emotional work).", "\"They are young and over reacted.\" They're late 20s! Young is 15, these are grown ass adults! And she's a human being, not an \"abstract thing\". Your dehumanizing language and apologetic behavior is really telling of how you view women.", "Oh because poor boys will be boys. F them"]}
