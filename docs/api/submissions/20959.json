You have to decide if you want to give them a chance to apologize in person, or stand your ground and only go if they apologize first. But that might cause issues too if they see you as a problem. LET ME BE CLEAR, they are most definitely massive assholes, but if you want to stay with your bf and keep the peace, you gotta figure out what you\u2019re comfortable with.

You humoured them and went so far to prove you were innocent, the least they can do is apologise. Red flag that your BF doesn't think they owe you an apology", "INFO. Have you considered that one of them made the account? \n\nTheir gleeful gang up is suspicious to me.", "OMG, NTA.  \"Make that b*tch prove herself\"??? WTF?  No, they wanted him to prove yourself to THEM... Your bf says he trusts you, and they try to convince him otherwise, while calling you dehumanizing names.  I can't believe your bf is still friends with these walking shit piles, or that he agreed to subject you to all of that.", "Well, I think you know the answer to this one.

Don\u2019t give up your voice, or your comfort bc your significant other has asked you to.

I had to legit scroll up to make sure we were taking about adults and not middle schoolers. Why is your boyfriend friends with such disgusting and disrespectful guys? Why would he feed into their BS and even calm you in the first place. He knew where exactly you were when the person responded. That should have immediately switched their focus to let\u2019s report this fake account instead of let\u2019s kill the witch. You shouldn\u2019t have to prove yourself and you should examine your relationship for other red flags.", "They should apologize to you and your bf should expect that from them!

That said, you are owed an apology once they found out you were innocent, and wanting it before you meet them is your prerogative.\n\nBut, like most communication issues it's best sorted out face to face, where a short conversation can resolve the issue one way or another.\n\nI don't think YTA if you don't go without that apology, but I think you're missing out on the chance to repair the relationship. BF should be demanding said apology, to you, regardless, but that's another issue.", "nta... but remember... they were protecting someone you love. without them meeting you you shouldnt take it personally.
