He was the nerdy, awkward with girls type and I was young and initially just wanted to casually date him. \n\nSo his friends and family were suspicious. One played a prank on me, calling me pretending to be random guy and asking me out.

DH and his buddies then planned something fun and they finally \u2018fessed up when I was groaning about how I wanted to join them instead of the date I had agreed to. \n\nThe suspicion continued to dog me though and my SIL actually didn\u2019t talk to me or acknowledge me for about a year through weekly family dinners, regular visits to her home, etc. She thawed when we got married and she realized I was serious and not just toying with him. Eventually I became her favourite SIL. \n\nAnyway - all this to say that they were unpleasant to me in many ways. I was taken aback but stayed polite and I kept rolling with it. Now I have a great relationship with my SIL and his buddies and tease them about how they went so overboard with me. Best of all, I have been married well over 20 years now to an amazing man. So it was well worth putting up with that nonsense. \n\nNot to excuse your bf\u2019s friends.

After he mentioned the movie night or after the facetime? \n\nBerating her after the movie is justified, because that doesn't really prove anything to them. But after the facetime they should have backed the fuck off and apologized, I agree.", "If you might not have to be around them much or at all in the future because he's quitting the job, then I definitely wouldn't go to the party. If he or they ask why, say it's because they made you uncomfortable with those accusations and they never apologized to you.", "If they\u2019re his work friends, he\u2019s quitting & never planning to see them again - why would he want you to go and meet them? \n\nThey\u2019re his _actual_ friends and all of them, including your BF, are AH.", "Then he'll presumably not interact as much with these people in the future, so they don't need to get to know you and you don't need to get to know them.", "Go to the party and you just became all that they said you were because you confined it.", "\nBut these are my bfs work friends and he's quitting in a week. The party might be sort of a going away party for him so I can see why he'd want to keep it civil for his final days at work.  \n\nAbsolutely skip this party. If BF is just going through motions to \u201ckeep things civil\u201d before he leaves in a few days, who cares? He\u2019ll maybe hang onto one friend after he leaves that job."]}
