He was the nerdy, awkward with girls type and I was young and initially just wanted to casually date him. \n\nSo his friends and family were suspicious. One played a prank on me, calling me pretending to be random guy and asking me out.

DH and his buddies then planned something fun and they finally \u2018fessed up when I was groaning about how I wanted to join them instead of the date I had agreed to. \n\nThe suspicion continued to dog me though and my SIL actually didn\u2019t talk to me or acknowledge me for about a year through weekly family dinners, regular visits to her home, etc. She thawed when we got married and she realized I was serious and not just toying with him. Eventually I became her favourite SIL. \n\nAnyway - all this to say that they were unpleasant to me in many ways. I was taken aback but stayed polite and I kept rolling with it. Now I have a great relationship with my SIL and his buddies and tease them about how they went so overboard with me. Best of all, I have been married well over 20 years now to an amazing man.

You know that at least a part of him thinks you would do this to him. \n\nMy grandfather used to say, \"Any man who tries to make you jump through hoops or 'prove' your loyalty ain't worth the spit to shine his shoes.\"", "Why thank you stranger :) alas, it wasn't so much clever as being aggravated by too many throwaway usernames taken \ud83d\ude02", "But it's the opposite of a throwaway username! To me, it reads like you change your mind mid-username. I guess you could say that you are aggravatingly clever or cleverly aggravating \u00af\u2060\\\u2060(\u2060\u00b0\u2060_\u2060o\u2060)\u2060/\u2060\u00af", "He won\u2019t put them in line. He\u2019s just like them. No decent person has friends like these.", "Birds of a feather flock together. Plus, boyfriend didn\u2019t even get mad at them.", " 100% agree. Also if bf has friends like this odds are he\u2019s just like them. They brought the info to him and called you names, demanded you prove yourself as if you owed it to them and then when you did they apologized to *your boyfriend* \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear they don\u2019t see you as a person just as a possession of your bf.\n\nIf he condones this behavior it\u2019s because he shares the same mindset.\n\nDump the dude- you deserve better. NTA but If you stay with this guy and subject yourself to this you\u2019re being one to yourself.", "Sure, she needs to stand up for herself. But it\u2019s also extremely important that her *BF* stands up to his friends as well on her behalf, or else that relationship is doomed.", "Why do I feel like one of them snagged one of her photos and created the fake profile? Sounds like the bros don't want their buddy to be dating anyone.", "It\u2019s at minimum a giant ass red billboard at time\u2019s square. You accept the love you think you deserve, I suppose.", "There are trust issues handled maturely and trust issues handled like an ass hole. Don\u2019t defend the boyfriend who was the latter.", "The friends are the ones with Tinder accounts. Did you want the bf to set up a Tinder account?\n\nThe bf allowed his friends to set up the test, so perhaps he had doubts. Either bf or OP could have said they would handle it between them. \n\nFriends get involved sometimes in allegedly toxic or abusive relationships. Like when they stage an intervention with a woman suspected of being in an abusive relationship, or a guy friend being used as a doormat.", "That\u2019s not how it works. There\u2019s no vote counting bot.", "Only the top comment is scanned, with it looking at the next post if the top vote isnt clear. The majority of the votes don't matter."]}
