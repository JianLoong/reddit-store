{"id": 28570, "submission_id": "173tpd8", "title": "AITA for ruining my boyfriend's couch and refusing to pay for the damage?", "selftext": "I (21f) got covid for the first time over the summer and got pretty sick. I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything but I had a high fever and could pretty much only lie down in a dark room for two weeks and I needed assistance with walking. I've recovered mostly but I've noticed my menstrual cycle has been off ever since. My first period post-covid came five days late and the next one was just a bit early. I figured with the third one it might be okay again. That brings me to my current issue:\n\nI was at my boyfriend's (25m) apartment this weekend watching a movie with him. We were on his couch which has the really light beige fabric. From the intro I feel like you can already guess what happened, but yeah I got my period unexpectedly and there's now a red stain on his couch. It had only been NINE days since the end of my last period so obviously I was not expecting this at all, even taking into account how irregular my cycle has been.\n\nMy boyfriend was furious. He loves that couch and it's still relatively new, like maybe a year and a half old. He told me I should ''plug it up'' all month long if I don't know when I'm getting my period to prevent this from happening, but that sounds ridiculous to me. Not only would that be uncomfortable for me to wear all month but it's also very expensive and I don't have the money for that.\n\nHe is now asking (more like demanding) me to pay for the professional cleaning services or an entirely new couch if they can't get rid of the stain. I've offered to look into alternative ways to get rid of it that are less expensive but he refused saying only a new couch or professional cleaning can make up for what I did.\n\nI think it's unfair because A) I didn't do it on purpose, how the hell am I supposed to know my period would come weeks too soon? and B) I'm a college student with practically no money whereas he has a well-paying job and could much more easily cover the cost of the damage.\n\nHis parents are on his side, my friends are divided. Two of them think I should pay for the cleaning services because it is my fault I wasn't wearing a pad or tampon. One friend thinks it's not my fault and that I should dump my boyfriend because of his reaction. I thought it wasn't my fault but with the majority of people involved being on my boyfriend's side, I'm very heavily doubting that now. So AITA for ruining his couch and not paying for it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Also before anyone comments on that, I've scheduled a doctor's appointment for later this week. Having my period a couple days late or early didn't seem that big of a problem before but with it being this irregular right now, I know it's important to speak with a professional.)", "created_utc": 1696862955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173tpd8/aita_for_ruining_my_boyfriends_couch_and_refusing/", "score": 1070, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not even talking about his primary reaction to be mad at you instead of being concerned for you.", "NTA for it happening, but you are responsible - You didn't know it was going to happen. It isn't like you squatted over his couch and forced yourself to bleed on it, just to spite him. You offered other alternatives as well to a brand new sofa, or an overly expensive cleaning. Start there, but if it doesn't get the stain out? You might need to agree look into something to replace it. Accident or not, it is still a stain that needs to go.But, also? You should probably leave him, if this is how he reacts to these kinds of situations, telling you to \"plug it up\"? I've accidentally ruined something of an ex's before, and while he did ask I help pay to replace it, he did so understandingly. Not angrily right out the gate.

Like pre-treat, Google to see what might help keep it from setting, or get it out? It doesn\u2019t sound like you did, you never mention it.

I dunno. If you\u2019ve made no attempt at addressing it since it happened you\u2019re TA and gross frankly. You\u2019re also on the hook for the stain. A 1.5 year old couch is a new couch imo.", "ESH. It went stupid. Would still say you are responsible for the damage. However, it is questionable whether only professional cleaning can repair the damage. He should at least give you the chance to get rid of it yourself. If you can't do that, his demand is justified.", "So yta because you should pay for professional cleaning. Don\u2019t replace the couch but I think professional cleaning is expected. That light coloured couch shouldn\u2019t be a testing group for you trying a cheap alternative. \n\nI think replacing the couch is way too extreme but you did damage it.

He is being aggressive but you also act like you not doing it on purpose means you don\u2019t have to take responsibility. It doesn\u2019t work like that.

Just pay for it, and wearing some kind of pad all the time until your cycle re-stabilizes is likely a good plan (I assume you don't want any more such surprises).

You had your period 9 days before that happened of course you\u2019re not going to be wearing one and that doesn\u2019t make it your fault at all.", "NTA.  Wearing tampons when not needed is a medical risk.  Sounds like you need a new boyfriend.  You do need to purchase appropriate materials and get his couch clean.

But also, get yourself someone who isn't going to treat you as less than human.", "You can remove the cover of that particular cushion and stick it in the washing machine on a cold cycle.

It\u2019s a horrible feeling realizing that it came unexpectedly and you got blood on something that isn\u2019t yours, it\u2019s just humiliating.\n\nIf it can\u2019t be cleaned up by you then you should chip in for the cleaning, but he also needs to understand that this is out of your control.  And using tampons without being on a period is dangerous, and pads are uncomfortable and yes all expensive so I get why you don\u2019t want to use them but it may be a good idea to also prevent embarrassing moments in public.

You mean to tell me you can feel something coming out of your vagina? Like you don\u2019t feel the wetness? You could wear a pantyliner they are not expensive.

Look, the fact your period came as a surprise is irrelevant. You stained his couch and while I sympathize with your desire to try alternative cleaning methods, there are two problems with that approach: 1) it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to get blood stains out of a light beige material on your own, especially when the blood has set at this point and 2) because it\u2019s a light colored material, there\u2019s a decent risk of you permanently discoloring the fabric with improvised methods even if you do manage to make the stain less noticeable. Sorry, but if you damage someone\u2019s property, you need to suck it up and pay for it to be returned to its original condition. \n\nThat\u2019s why you suck. Your boyfriend sucks because of his reaction. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be happy if someone bled on my couch but I also wouldn\u2019t tell them to \u201cplug it up\u201d all month long. It was clearly an accident and his response is both immature and over the top. At a minimum, if I were in his shoes and knew you couldn\u2019t afford the full cost of cleaning upfront, I\u2019d work out a repayment schedule with you and get my poor couch cleaned ASAP. Delaying things isn\u2019t going to help the situation.", "Trying to clean the stain with home remedies might make it worse. Our first thought would be oh let\u2019s use bleach which is going to strip the fabric color. Professional cleaning of the couch/ cushion is the best way to go.

His dumb plug it up comment is idiotic but if you\u2019re that irregular right now wearing a small pad \u2018just in case\u2019 might be a good idea until you figure out what\u2019s going on.

If I couldn't afford it for whatever reason I'd make a deal with them to have it done and then pay small amounts each month or something. That's coz while it's not intentional.. it did damage his couch. On the other hand he could be more understanding towards you considering it wasn't intentional and that you dont have the money to pay... so if you wanna dump his coz you'll don't share the same level of understanding.. thats fine too... \n\nI'd pay and then dump him. Simple. \n\nI hope you atleast apologized to him for the damage.", "ESH.  \n\n\nYou made the stain. It wasn't intentional yet it was your bodily fluid that made it so you should clean it.  \n\n\nBF is overreacting though. There are cleaning products that can clean up the fabric and without even damaging the color of the fabric.

I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything but I had a high fever and could pretty much only lie down in a dark room for two weeks and I needed assistance with walking. I've recovered mostly but I've noticed my menstrual cycle has been off ever since. My first period post-covid came five days late and the next one was just a bit early. I figured with the third one it might be okay again. That brings me to my current issue:\n\nI was at my boyfriend's (25m) apartment this weekend watching a movie with him. We were on his couch which has the really light beige fabric. From the intro I feel like you can already guess what happened, but yeah I got my period unexpectedly and there's now a red stain on his couch. It had only been NINE days since the end of my last period so obviously I was not expecting this at all, even taking into account how irregular my cycle has been.\n\nMy boyfriend was furious. He loves that couch and it's still relatively new, like maybe a year and a half old. He told me I should ''plug it up'' all month long if I don't know when I'm getting my period to prevent this from happening, but that sounds ridiculous to me. Not only would that be uncomfortable for me to wear all month but it's also very expensive and I don't have the money for that.\n\nHe is now asking (more like demanding) me to pay for the professional cleaning services or an entirely new couch if they can't get rid of the stain. I've offered to look into alternative ways to get rid of it that are less expensive but he refused saying only a new couch or professional cleaning can make up for what I did.\n\nI think it's unfair because A) I didn't do it on purpose, how the hell am I supposed to know my period would come weeks too soon? and B) I'm a college student with practically no money whereas he has a well-paying job and could much more easily cover the cost of the damage.\n\nHis parents are on his side, my friends are divided. Two of them think I should pay for the cleaning services because it is my fault I wasn't wearing a pad or tampon. One friend thinks it's not my fault and that I should dump my boyfriend because of his reaction. I thought it wasn't my fault but with the majority of people involved being on my boyfriend's side, I'm very heavily doubting that now. So AITA for ruining his couch and not paying for it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Also before anyone comments on that, I've scheduled a doctor's appointment for later this week. Having my period a couple days late or early didn't seem that big of a problem before but with it being this irregular right now, I know it's important to speak with a professional.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There are some that are barely noticeable but they should give you enough time to realize your period has started and switch to tampons (or your preferred product). \n\nSeventh, if you don't like that option, what about buying period underwear that are more absorbent?", "Hydrogen peroxide gets blood out of fabric.", "I\u2019m not getting into the weeds on the payment issue even though I know that\u2019s what you asked.

Every adult man who dates women should be capable of taking that into consideration too. \n\nYes, the girlfriend should do everything she can (to the extent that her boyfriend will let her) to clean the couch herself. But if he's going to insist on professional cleaning services that she as a broke college student can't afford, then he ought not to have been dating a broke college student. He had choices here, including buying a darker-colored couch *or* dating a woman comparably financially well-off to himself. He chose neither.\n\nMeanwhile, the girlfriend's choices were . . . what? Pay six times more than necessary to wear pads every day of the year (it'd have to be pads, because wearing tampons when not having a period is a serious health risk) just in case of periods when she had no reason to expect them? Again, if he wanted to require something that expensive and ridiculous, he should have been dating a woman who could afford it - though it's hard to imagine that many women would be willing to comply with such a ridiculous request even if they could afford it.\n\nAnd it's not like she bled on a random stranger's couch. They're in a romantic relationship. Prospective life partners should be dividing responsibilities according to what each of them is best equipped to handle. Professional cleaning is an expense that he has the income for and she doesn't. Accordingly, he should take on the financial tasks he's better equipped to handle, and she should try to make it up to him with whatever she's better able to do.\n\nThe girlfriend made zero bad decisions here.
