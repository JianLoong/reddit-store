We are talking about moving in together but that is besides the point. \n\nOn Sunday I broke my foot in a few different places. I was with my parents who took me to the doctor. I was lucky it was not surgical and will just require a cast and crutches. My BF who is a golf pro has some networking events this week after work hours on top of having to work. I have asked the last couple of nights if he would come over because I just really need it. (I currently live alone) and I\u2019m out of work for a little bit to heal. He kept saying maybe or no because he has a full week. I told my parents about this and they were also wondering why? My parents and my BF are close and always have been in good terms. \n\nTonight I finally said that I was upset well not upset but a little disappointed as I could really use him. Im bored, sore and just needing someone to be here for me. I feel like I\u2019m not getting the support I need in this time.  AITA for yelling at him?\n\nEdit 1: He is not a professional golfer he works at the course as a \u201cgolf pro\u201d. 40hr week and optional networking. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not looking for entertainment all day just a couple hours at night for cuddling.\n\nEdit 3: Injury is not minor. I could do surgery but chose to let it naturally heal as surgery is expensive and invasive. \n\nEdit4: Thank you all for your comments.

When he arrived, visiting hrs had just finished, but the nurse let him come up quickly because of what he had done. He then drove all the way back home again. This is my standard of how relationships should be now. Your partner could've taken 30 minutes out of his life to come and see you.", "I say NTA. You\u2019re feeling vulnerable and looking for support from your long term partner. That isn\u2019t an unreasonable request. I guess more needs to be known - how much time do you normally spend together?", "Info   \nWait, so is he actually working at the golf course or is he drinking at the golf course?   \n\n\nLike can he and has he taken any time off just to visit you even once in the hospital?", "NTA.

You wouldn\u2019t have to tell him you need him. Stop making excuses for him. And think long and hard about whether having him as a long term partner or husband would be. Don\u2019t expect him to be any different when you are pregnant, overwhelmed with toddlers or older and ill. Yelling at him was not the right way to handle the situation but consider this a wake up call.", "YTA\n\nJust read over your post, he has a full week and your injury is not severe. \n\nIf you are interested in a long term relationship with a pro golfer, you need to be used to separation. I\u2019m sure they have to travel quite often.", "Yta you are bored and sore and he has work.", "I'm going to go with ESH. \n\nYou may not have a major injury, but it's not really minor either. Plus, you probably have a little shock from the event that caused the injury. You are well within your rights to request and expect that a long-term SO (who you are serious enough to consider moving in with) would care enough to be there to support you, even if it had to be after his work/events. If he didn't want to stay overnight just to hold you, he could have come for an hour with minimal disruption to his schedule since, from what I can see, he's still in town (this would be differentif he were out of town). This is the person you plan to spend your life with? I mean, it's not a relationship I see as ready to move in yet. Will he move out if you get sick because it's 'too disruptive'?\n\nOn the other hand, he's got a really busy work week, you have support, he's obviously in contact, possibly stressed/exhausted... and from what you've written, you are sending mixed signals about your needs. Effective communication is key in any healthy relationship, and it doesn't really sound like you have done that very well. You downplay, complain that you don't need anything but some hugs (which your parents were there to provide), and then yell when he thinks you are OK to wait until his day off? Nah, you need to be clear that you need emotional support and stop muddying the waters.", "YTA\n\nStop treating your bf as an emotional support animal. \n\nComon, you have a painfull bad not really bad injury. You have time off and can get around with crutches. This does not justify you demanding your bf cancel his premade plans. Just call some friends over if you are bored in the evening.", "It is understandable to want support and care but we are living in a world were we can't even care for ourselves like 2 jobs etc and ppl manage hardly getting their life in order . Times has changed . Women gave up themselves to take care of others and partly still do like majority of daughters take care of the elderly parents . We were expected to be carrying and giving no matter how we are doing .\n\nYou picked a guy you doesn't seem to have the carry bug in him otherwise he wouldn't need to be asked to come or like I said in the beginning he is burned out himself .\n\nIt is normal to want to be cared for and someone who loves you will do it . Did you ask him how he feels ? It doesn't sound like he needs someone because he doesn't visit you to spend time with you. How often did he visit before ? is he really busy with work or what is his excuse not to hang out with you ? you have to talk to him but don't expect him to turn into a caregiver when it isn't in his nature that was what women were raised to be but even women care less nowadays sure there are still enough there who take the tradional role but you can see it's going down .", "Absolutely yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I broke my foot and ankle and my husband left for a fishing trip out of town. He deserved that time off because he works hard for our future and they planned this almost a year before.

He is not a golfer but works at the course.

It's not the same as being a PGA professional golfer, which is what OP was pointing out. The networking aspect may be that OP's BF wants to get onto the tour scene or network with tour pros, but he would need to enter and qualify like everyone else, so it seems unlikely. It's probably more that the club wants him to schmooze the rich club members and secure coaching opportunities.\n\nEither way, he shouldn't be prioritising optional networking over visiting his injured GF. Presumably she would like to feel like more of a priority than the bigwigs at the club.", "> BF who is a golf pro has some networking events this week after work hours on top of having to work.\n\n...\n\n> Thank you!
