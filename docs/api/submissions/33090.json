Jane and Max have known each other since high school, and Max would come over every month as a \u201cfamily bonding session\u201d. \n\nMax would always pass passive aggressive comments about me.

When I first bought my house, I converted one of the 3 rooms into a personal office. I\u2019m a small business owner and also work full time, so I need that space. They were invited to housewarming and he said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a scam like the other small businesses. You just want to look cool by having a home office.\u201d \n\nMax and Jane usually stay at my parents\u2019 house, but due to renovations, they cannot be accommodated.

I texted them back saying \u201cThat\u2019s cuz he\u2019s my boyfriend, and also pays for dinner, or sometimes cooks dinner whenever he\u2019s here.
