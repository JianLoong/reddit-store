YTA. It's literally dogs vs a human baby. A baby that has no recourse, can't move away from the dogs, can't seek alternative arrangements, and is completely dependent on you. You are condemning your own child to suffering, because no matter how much you'll try to separate them, it's nearly impossible to do in a household.", "YTA I get that this is difficult. But your child comes first. Eczema can cause discomfort and pain. You maybe to keep them separate now but that\u2019s not a long term solution. Also, pet dander is all throughout your home!!

How bad are his allergies and his eczema?  Can they be controlled by medication?   In my family we got two awesome cats a few years before our twins were born and after a few years we learned that one of the twins was mildly allergic to cats.  He loves the cats and knows that if he pets them he needs to wash his hands right away, and we keep the cats out of his room.  Otherwise, he's pretty much fine.  But, if he was worse, we would have got rid of our cats which would have been heartbreaking but the right thing to do.  Our son has no choice about where to live and neither does your baby boy.  Lastly, I'll say that when babies are babies they are adorable but exhausting and its sometimes hard to think of them as people.  Meanwhile, you probably love your three dogs like family.  This is understandable.  But if your son is suffering and you can't mitigate with medicine, keeping his door closed, keeping the dogs on a different floor, etc., then you would be the AH for forcing your son to suffer every day.", "NTA.
