If they\u2019ve reacted so violently it\u2019s probably cause you hit a nerve and they know what you\u2019re saying is right. The truth is that if they cause you a lot of stress like this it\u2019s probably best to have some time apart - being related by blood doesn\u2019t excuse poor or unfair behaviour.", "Info:  And you want these toxic people in your life because?", "NTA.  This is the time where you carve our your own life with your husband and move on. No more helping them out.  Let the favored children do it.  You just pointed out the obvious and the fact they reacted like that and said what they did only reinforces it.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being treated fairly, and being honest, you're probably better off with less contact with them.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Their defensive reaction makes it appear you struck a nerve. Hopefully, you'll be able to talk this through with adults with your siblings someday if not soon.", "There\u2019s no shame in dumping the lot of them out of your life. If they cause you stress, frustration, anger, and pain, it\u2019s best if you ghost every one of them for your own mental health. Do not ask them for help, do not depend on them for anything. Find other ways to manage your problems that don\u2019t include them. Good luck.", "NTA, go NC ASAP", "NTA.  I am an adult child of a family where I grew up as the scapegoat.  In my case my mother was viciously abusive - physically and verbally.  I've always been treated different.  My siblings and parents all see eachother more and talk regularly - I'm mostly left out.  The point is, they are not going to change so instead of waiting for things to get better, I need to remind myself that this is the relationship we have and make decisions based on that.  You can recognize this fact in your life and decide to go low contact with all of them and be cordial when you do see eachother.  I wouldn't waste your time trying to convince them about your different reality because, as you said, they haven't lived it and simply do not understand.  Good luck and hugs!", "NTA. They take you for granted, as a good child who never complains, always gives and expects little in return. \nThis whole dynamic seems fucked up. If they are saying that you desteoyed this relationship over one comment from your side, it sounds to me like gaslighting. As an adult you have to draw a clear boundary with them, even if that will hurt. \nThey need to realize that the tactic of blaming you and then bullying (which is what they're doing when turning your siblings against you) will no longer work. Maybe they'll come around if they realize it. If they won't, you'd have to reconsider if they are people you still want in your life (or to what extent you'd wish to keep in touch).\nI wish you all the best, however. It's not an easy road.", "NTA", "Ugh, parents can be such assholes sometimes. But hey, at least you stood up for yourself!
