If they are saying that you desteoyed this relationship over one comment from your side, it sounds to me like gaslighting. As an adult you have to draw a clear boundary with them, even if that will hurt. \nThey need to realize that the tactic of blaming you and then bullying (which is what they're doing when turning your siblings against you) will no longer work. Maybe they'll come around if they realize it.

Hell there is barely anything tying us now. \n\nYour siblings know the disparity, but they just choose to ignore it. Send a group text to EVERYONE and tell them how you feel and mute/block them.

They reacted exactly as I expected.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that your husband sees the difference in treatment between you and your siblings. It can be so crazy-making to experience it alone, and it seems like you spent a long, long time alone in these feelings. I have a close friend from childhood that routinely acknowledges and validates my feelings about words and actions not matching in my family dynamics (and I\u2019ve been able to do the same for them and their family). It is such a good thing a friend or spouse can do. Really pulls you out of that lost child feeling.\n\nAlso agree very much that constant shallow offers to help anytime are just confusing when it turns out they are just words. I really respect that you addressed this with them. \n\nPeople here are saying go NC. That\u2019s an option. I went low contact for a while and researched toxic family dynamics. One of the hardest and most confusing things we do in life is establish adult relationships with our parents after we\u2019re grown. My biggest lesson was to lower my expectations and to keep my safe and validating friends close. Learning about things like toxic shame and toxic drama seeking patterns in families has really helped. \n\nI wish you so much luck.

It is NOT your fault. I just mean they will twist it to make you look like the bad guy even more). They will not see the error of their ways unfortunately. The reason why some  families have a scapegoat to begin with is so that they can project all of their dysfunction onto that one person so that they don\u2019t have to take accountability for it. A lot of it is subconscious and a lot of families never realise they have done this. A lot of scapegoats never realise they are scapegoats and go through their entire lives thinking there is something wrong with them and believe that everything is their fault.

They said no again so I thought maybe they just can\u2019t handle stuff like that anymore (even though they move their plans around for my siblings). \n\nI know it was an excuse because I asked them to let my dog out about 2 other times this year and they had similar excuses where it was obvious that it was doable.
