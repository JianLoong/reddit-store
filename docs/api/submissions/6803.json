{"id": 6803, "submission_id": "106iram", "title": "AITA for blowing up at my gf who booked multiple trips without (telling) me", "selftext": "So last year January my gf told me for her new years resolutions she was going to travel. She'd been talking about wanting to for years. She told me about a trip she had all planned out and was going on by herself. We just finished studies and started fulltime jobs so we both never really had money to travel before.\n\nAt the time I was against it because I really wanted us to travel together. So I suggested/insisted for her to not go on the trip and save/use that money for us to travel together instead since we couldn't afford to do both. She agreed.\n\nHowever work got pretty hectic (for me) and I was never actually able to take my vacation days to go on a proper holiday with her. She never expressed any regret or anger about it to me. It just didn't happen. Sucks, but there's always next year right?\n\nAnyway fast forward to today and we were again talking about new years resolutions and she dropped the bomb on me that she actually booked MULTIPLE weekend trips for this year already. Without saying anything about to me.\n\nI got kind of upset with her and she casually told me I am always free to come and we will still make travel plans together also. Like it's no big deal. I told her that's not the point and expressed a lot of hurt and anger about the fact that she booked it without telling me and seemingly didn't care about my opinion at all.\n\nThen she then in turn blew up on me about last year and the fact that I \"stopped\" her from traveling when I knew that was the one thing she really wanted. That before she cancelled she'd asked me again and again if I was sure we'd go and I promised her we would (which was my freaking intention!) and we didn't, so in her disappointment she decided from then on she wouldn't rely on other people anymore to make her plans happen. Immature IMO because I'm her partner not just people.\n\nI do get her disappointment but as I reminded her it wasn't intentional on my part, like completely beyond my control, and she never mentioned being upset or anything about it before now. I would have been happy to apologize or acknowledge her feelings if she came to me about it.\n\nShe said she didn't mention last year before because she didn't want to make me feel bad and hold it against me because she knew it was out of my control, decided she was just going to go for it in the future if she wanted something for herself and that's why she did it. So I said is that how it's going to be from now on then? Like 0 communication. Of course she isn't required to ask my permission to go but I think it should be talked about. That's how a partnership works. \n\nI especially can't stand how she is convinced she did nothing wrong whatsoever and I am the total asshole in this situation for blowing up at her the way I am when it's really the other way around.\n\nShe's reading this with me.

Last year she waited for you and it didn't happen because of you. Realize she only has one life and it's not \"just another year\".\n\nIf you were so sorry for last year you could at least tell her when you'll be able to travel this year. But somehow you also didn't do that in advance.", "YTA. your gf told you she wants to travel. You ruined her chances last year. She traveling this year, and invited you. Now your complaining to her. How about instead of complaining to her\u2026.you get your shit together and figure out a trip or two you both can go on?", "YTA.  Unless she was planning on using your money to travel last year, you get NO SAY in what she does.  So let me break this down.  You:\n\n1. Tried to control her life because you didn't want her traveling without you by PROMISING that y'all would get to travel together.\n2. Failed to keep your promise that y'all would travel together.\n3. Are now throwing a toddler's tantrum over the fact that she's not going to take your word that y'all will get to travel together this year (since you didn't keep your word last year) and just decided to book her own trips (which she says you're more than welcome to come on).\n\nYou sir, are a massive, controlling, jerk of an asshole.  If I were her, I honestly probably would have started questioning the relationship last year when you kept me from living my dreams.  Get over yourself, you're wants are NOT more important than her wants.", "YTA when you knew after a few months you couldn't schedule a trip you should have told her to plan something for herself and to go have fun.\n\nYou prevented her for traveling for a year. I totally get that she's now booked stuff and you can choose which (if any) of those trips work for you.", "So OP:\n\n- insisted that GF shouldn't travel without OP\n\n- didn't travel with GF\n\n- got upset that GF made her own plans. \n\n\nYeah, life happens. So join her on her trips? She's said you can. \n\nReally sounds like she *cant* tell OP what her plans are because he'll make excuses. \n\nYTA for being controlling. She should be allowed to travel by herself and no one gets to insist otherwise.\n\nEdit to add: GF had booked some *weekends* away. It isn't even a week. Which means that's what she was probably asking OP, who couldn't even spare her *one weekend in a whole year*. And OP is asking if he's TA for blowing up at her? OP is lucky to still have a GF.", "YTA, it\u2019s next year.  Gf was extremely gracious in not getting angry or expressing regret to you in the past year.\n\nGf, is going ahead with her plans, said you can come along if you want.  Don\u2019t expect her to sit at home and continue to wait for \u201cnext year.\u201d", "YTA. For insisting she cancel her original travel plans to suit you and for trying to control her now. Well done to her for making her own plans for achieving her own goals. She is not answerable to you and she\u2019s not the one who\u2019s being immature. You owe her an apology for blowing up at her.", "YTA. Kudos to your girlfriend for taking charge of her life and not letting you hold her back.", "Of course she doesn\u2019t need my permission\u2026\nA year ago you insisted that she not go on that trip and that you\u2019d travel together.  Promised. And she canceled them all. \nThis resolution was important to her and having it come to nothing must have hurt, it\u2019s not a question of blame, she\u2019s simply not going to see a repeat of last year and so she took the initiative and is following through with her plans. If you can join her it sounds like she\u2019s receptive to that, and if you can\u2019t, well, this is a chance to bring her dreams to fruition that she will not miss.\nIt\u2019s amazing how time flies even when you\u2019re not having fun, and at 61 years old my advice to anyone who wants to travel is, do it as soon as you can, life gets complicated. \nYTA. Life marches on, take what trips you can and you\u2019ve been given notice, it\u2019s on.\n\nTLDR: YTA, she is making good on her intentions after a whole year of waiting.", "YTA.\n\nYour girlfriend had plans to travel alone, you insisted on making them joint trips and then you made no time for those trips. And rather than complaining to you, your girlfriend has booked something you can join her on if you so wish/if you can make it work. \n\nAs for your comment that if should be talked about, there is zero communication. Hang on, she's communicating with you by telling you now, and you have the opportunity to make your schedule work to join her. It isn't like she is announcing each trip 1 day before she's due to depart.", "YTA. You are the immature one.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is her own person and you need to realize that. If you wanted it \u201cas bad\u201d as her, you would have taken the initiative yourself, which is exactly what she did. You think your feelings are more important than hers, and they aren\u2019t. NOBODY is promised tomorrow. Grow up, dude. You\u2019re holding other people back.", "YTA - she gave u chance last year", "I have a love a traveling as well and had the money to do so. A few years ago, I decided to start scouting places with my partner to travel to. Basically the same that your girlfriend did with you, OP. He backed out and to be a good partner I didn\u2019t travel as I felt he would feel bad. \n\nJust to say, he\u2019s now an ex. I finally got the confidence I needed to walk away because there were some other issues but the trying to talk me out of traveling without him was the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nOP, YTA. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d like to go with her and what your intentions are but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Instead of complaining about her going alone, find the time and travel together even if it\u2019s for a weekend. Don\u2019t resent your girlfriend because you can\u2019t go. \n\nGirlfriend, under no circumstances should you cancel your alone trips because your boyfriend is working and doesn\u2019t take the time off to go with you. Go, travel, explore the world around you. See new things, meet new people, eat amazing things. It will be life changing which may be something that OP is afraid of. Do it for you, your happiness, your mental health. \n\nI\u2019m saying this from my current trip I\u2019m on btw, without my current partner.", "YTA, What's stopping you from planning a trip right now that works for you both if you really do want to travel with her ? Her travelling and having plans has no reason to stop you from planing something too. You're just upset her life does not revolve around you", "Couple things, if you\u2019re entitled to vacation and didn\u2019t take it that is your choice regardless of how busy work is, they have to make the accommodations if it\u2019s in your contract that you have vacation days. And you should take them, you are way more important to your significant other than to work, if you die tomorrow they will replace you, she will grieve you never forget that. \n\nWhen you realized you weren\u2019t going to be able to go on a trip last year why didn\u2019t you tell her it was okay to go on the trip alone, if you aren\u2019t able to attend that\u2019s not really her problem. \n\nI think she probably assumed work would be your priority again this year and therefore wanted to focus on her priority this year too which is obviously to travel. I\u2019m voting YTA only because I think when you realized you wouldn\u2019t be able to take time off last year you should have let her go.", "IMO Anyone who allows work to dominate their life is TA. You have a choice when it comes to where your time is spent, trying to claim otherwise is straight up BS. \nWe are all capable of saying NO.", "YTA for not letting go of your conviction that you *have* to go together, for even *one* trip she planned in the whole year, after repeated attempts to go, reassuring her you would be able to, getting her hopes up each time and then have her cancel the trips each time. After you noticed the erratic work pattern, you should've made sure to secure vacation days she could plan trips on. After a year of disappointments, it's obvious she's distrustful. So she did what she should've done in the first place\u2013book several trips, and be willing to make adjustments whenever you also would be able to come. If her chosen career allows it, she has the right to live her life. If yours interferes, it's a problem she has to resolve, and she did. I think it was a bit of a dickish move to not tell you anything, but also you would've insisted *again* that she keeps prioritizing you over herself, and it can get tiring veeery quickly. Express your feelings of being left out, which are valid, but don't press her to conform to your career and lifestyle again. Quick road to breaking up.", "YTA. If you promise things \u201ccompletely beyond your control,\u201d don\u2019t act surprised when people stop believing you.", "YTA and good for your girlfriend. She's moving ahead with her passions. You are welcome to join her so figure it out.\n\nEveryone gets some vacation so if you didn't make it work after a whole year, that's on you. You're going to have to sort out your priorities if you want to stay with a wanderer. \n\nAnd maybe you just aren't compatible. One reason hubby and I stayed together all this time is we both love travelling and figure out a way to make it happen. You need to decide if this is what you want in a relationship. If not, let her be free to find a fellow wanderer.", "YTA how long is she meant to wait??", "YTA- for 12 months you prevented her from travelling by forcing her to wait till your schedule and budget allowed it. Life\u2019s too short  and she wisely set it based on her schedule & budget. It\u2019s up to you to join or not. But you are a controlling, manipulative assh0le if for a second year you attempt to get in her way.", "YTA. You owe her an apology. \"Sucks but there's always next year\" isn't good enough. She could have traveled that year, but didn't at your request. You failed to follow through with actually making time to travel with her, so now you get left behind.", "YTA. You\u2019re claiming she didn\u2019t tell you about the trips but she literally just did tell you so what\u2019s the problem? I\u2019m single but I solo travel at times even though I take other trips with friends and family too and I totally agree with her point. You can\u2019t keep waiting on people to do what you want to do in life because it might not end up happening", "YTA yeaahhhhh it was ok to express desire to travel together nothing wrong with that. However demanding she wait was kinda a bit much. If you were sorry you couldn\u2019t get time off for a stint then express that in the moment and work with her to plan it.\n\nMost jobs have pto and you should use it, work case of your job is shitty and wipes your pto yearly (not legal). But you should figure out how much time you can accrue and when you could \u201cgo together\u201d but at the same time If she wants to go and you can\u2019t don\u2019t hold her down to it. If she wants to go for a weekend trip some where try to go with her if you can\u2019t you can\u2019t the important thing is to try rather than try to control it to fit your wants.", "YTA. You say you have more free time now, so you could have taken the initiative and planned a trip if you actually wanted to travel together, in fact you still can. There's no reason you can't do both couples and solo trips. Last year she tried to make plans with you and they never worked out. It isn't fair to expect her to put off her plans again when you've shown these couples trips never happen.", "Speaking as someone with a lot of regret and chronic procrastination, YTA. The attitude of \"there's always another year\" will lead to a lot of missed opportunities. You gotta take the opportunity while you can.", "YTA\n\nYou asked her to hold off and didn't think she minded for a whole year. It sounds like you didn't even ask her how she felt about having to abandon her plans last year for your work priorities.\n\nKudos to her for making sure they happened this year. It doesn't mean you are not going together - you can always join her - it just means she won't miss out going because of you.  Life is short.", "YTA instead of crying here and in your comments how she booked without including you in the planning (\"because it's sooooo important for you to do these things together\" lol) you could use this energy to make a few of her booked trips work for you as well and simply join her. \n\nShe delayed her plans to travel one whole year for you and nothing happened. It's no wonder she from now on will do her thing and you're welcome to join... or not. \n\nIn my opinion things would be different if you had a kid or pet which you would need to stay home with and care for. In that case it would be neccessary to check the dates with you beforehand. But from what you said I really don't see what she should apologize for.", "YTA. You fooled her once, she's not letting you fool her twice. It doesn't matter that it wasn't your intention. That's why she didn't blow up at you at first. But you can't really blame her for thinking this will happen again.", "YTA. Even when in a relationship, that doesn\u2019t require either of the partners to have to give up their desires or wishes just cause the other can\u2019t go. You held her back in that last year by letting her down, causing her to experience multiple disappointments throughout that year. You didn\u2019t even bother talking to hee about it then cause she didn\u2019t express it to you how she felt? But you knew she wanted to travel more? And now you feel like there\u2019s no communication just because she decided to pursue her dreams and wishes? If you really want to travel more with her, you\u2019d prioritize that too over constantly working, which semi makes it seem like you value her wishes less than your job for constantly canceling on her. I\u2019d apologize and just book a ticket for the travels you want to be at when you ARE in fact able to join her. Let her pursue her dreams and wishes", "YTA\n\nShe's a smart woman for going ahead with her plans because you've shown her that you're unreliable. She's not barring you from coming along, but she is not required to sit by while you work.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you didn't intend to ruin her plans. You did. You prevented her from doing what she wanted for a year.\n\nAnd then when she told you about her plans for this year, you blew up at her and turn around and say there was zero communication. She communicated with you; you just don't like what she said.", "YTA\n\nShe informed you LAST YEAR that she wanted to travel. You told her very specifically that you don't want her to go by herself and wanted to join. Yet you could not make it happen, not ONCE in a whole year. Now that she knows she cannot depend on you or your schedule, she decided to book tickets for when it suits HER. And you're pissed at her for doing that? What if you are unable to travel this year too? Is she supposed to just wait another year, hoping for you to prioritise travelling? God your post pissed me off so much. Let her be. She communicated her need of travelling to you and you shut it down every single time because you prioritised your own needs every single time for a whole fucking year. Now you know her travel dates in advance. If you wish to travel with her, go ahead, do it. If not then let her have the time of her life like she deserves.", "YTA. If she had told you before booking the trips, it would have been a repeat of last year. No reason for you to blow up, especially since you\u2019re welcome to join her on any of them.", "YTA. \n\nWhat if she goes on unplanned girls\u2019 trips- you gonna go on those too? She offered to bring you along if it suits you and she\u2019s told you way before any of them have even happened. Chill out man.", "YTA. You so are trying to control your gf. Good on her for not putting up with it anymore. Who cares about your intentions, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "YTA. Let her do what she wants, and if you are available and have money to join her, then you can", "YTA. Your girlfriend waited around all last year for you, and you didn\u2019t make the time to travel with her like you\u2019d promised you would. She does not need your permission, approval, or opinion to travel. She also doesn\u2019t need your company to travel. \n\nIt sounds to me like she\u2019s an adventurous, independent, ambitious woman who knows what she wants and is willing to make it happen on her own. You seem to be incredibly threatened by those qualities, when most men would find them incredibly attractive and worthwhile. \n\nYou should really work on that.", "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions, but intentions are not actions and based on last years actions, she knows that this year will be the same \u201cintentions\u201d with no follow through. \n\nSeriously?  Come on now. You couldn\u2019t manage a single weekend trip?  I highly doubt that. I\u2019ll lay odds that you just kept telling her \u201csorry babe, too tired, next weekend, next month, reasons, reasons, reasons.\u201d \n\nShe has booked \u201cweekend\u201d trips not a solo all inclusive trip around the world.  She has also said you are welcome to join in. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nYou say 0 communication? \n\nShe made her needs very plain to you \n\nYou didn\u2019t listen", "YTA. Absolutely. You chose to not take time off. You could've made it work but you made clear your priorities. You don't own her and she should be encouraged to travel, be her own person without being punished because you can't make it work. It was her resolution, not yours. And like she said, she's still willing to travel with you also but she's rightly not going to put her wants and dreams on hold.", "YTA it sounds to me like it\u2019s not so much that you also want to travel, but that you don\u2019t want her to do things without you. You are two separate people and you\u2019re holding her back. She can (and should be able to) do her own thing. I\u2019ve been in both positions and I would hate to be the reason someone that I care about can\u2019t do something that they really want to do.", "YTA\n\nOMG you are controlling. She has never made any secret of the fact she wants to travel and last year you prevented her from doing that. She is your GF and not chained to you (I hope). If I were her you would have a nice large black bootprint on your arse and I would be seriously asking myself if I want a future with someone who behaves/thinks like this\n\nI have been with my husband for nearly 30 years and I go off travelling several times a year as he can't get away. We also travel together and have great fun - a relationship is about trust, fun, respect, tolerance etc", "YTA.   She tried, you couldn't.   She didn't hold it against you, but can you blame for making sure she gets to travel?", "YTA and you are controlling wtf dude\nYou decided not to go? What should she do?\nLock herself in a bloody closet and throw the key away whilst waiting for you? DAMN", "YTA - you\u2019re a controlling asshole. You\u2019re prioritising yourself and not at all what your girlfriend wants. Let her live her life for gods sake. It\u2019s not like she did this out of nowhere. You need to realise that you promised her before but you didn\u2019t follow through. She has no guarantee that you won\u2019t do the same this year so she booked her trips. She even said that you\u2019re welcome to go with her. You\u2019re so butthurt over this but you were the one to break her promise before. You say you intended on it, yes fine, but you didn\u2019t follow through. So I f you carry on with breaking your promise for the next however many years, do you expect her to put her dream of travelling on hold? How in the world is that fair to her? Don\u2019t be selfish, let the woman enjoy her life.", "YTA. A huge, childish AH. I hope she breaks up with you and enjoys all of her wonderful travels.", "YTA. You can't expect anyone to sit around and wait until you get ready to do something. \n\nThe proper way of handling it last year would have been to remember when she wanted to go on the trip, and AS SOON AS you realized you couldn't make it, then apologize and suggest she go on her own. With these new trips, you need to decide which ones you can go on, then make it happen. Otherwise, don't hold her back.\n\nAnd if this really bothers you and you can't get beyond, your not the guy she needs to be with.", "YTA 100%\n\nYou lied to her last year. She ain't falling for it again this year.  Figure out how to take some PTO or be grateful she's willing to go on her own.", "YTA-you made a choice.  She is allowed to make her choice too.  This past year, my husband determined he Cdnt travel as much even though he has the time.  I, who has the same time, decided I cd.  As such, I took two additional trips.", "YTA are your finances shared or separate? If they\u2019re separate, you\u2019re a super AH! She said if your schedule works out you can still attend the trips. And I\u2019m sure she would be THRILLED to go on more that do fit in your schedule. Whats your deal dude?", "You are such a f*cking AH. You fool, no sometimes there isn\u2019t next year!", "YTA. She is a grown woman who is allowed to do things alllllll by herself.", "YTA\nThis is important to her and has been something she has been wanting to do for a while. It sucked that your work schedule didn't allow you to travel together, but she put this off for a YEAR. Who knows what your work will allow this year. If she keeps putting off traveling year after year, she will grow to resent you.\nAlso, she is more than happy to travel with you when your schedule allows. She just won't allow your work to rule her life.", "YTA, she\u2019s already postponed plans for you, you could of when it was cancelled because YOU were too hectic at work rescheduled and planned something but you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not that you want to travel, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want her todo things without you. \n\nYou\u2019re controlling and immature, she wants to travel let her travel without this victim hood mentality , if you\u2019re also free the weekend that she is join her, stop holding her back from enjoying life and exploring the world", "One phrase stuck out \"that's how a partnership works\". You are clearly not coming at this from a place of 'partners' but from a place of 'what about ME' \n\nWe do not know her side of the story - we have only your words to go by. \n\nBy your own words, you promised several times over the past year to do X and even though each individual reason may have been a good one, the overall affect was that X never happened.\n\nI don't blame her a bit for booking the trips. She did so in a way that you can join or not as you choose. That's not being \"immature\"...actually, that shows she cares about you and the relationship. \n- You throwing a fit is immature. \n- You demanding that it has to be your way (talking to you first, getting your permission to book a trip) is immature.\n- You expecting her to put her life on hold for you is immature. \n\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. She\u2019s finding a way to prioritise the things that are important to her. You\u2019re doing the same. Those things don\u2019t happen to be the same, yet you expect her to put hers on hold for you? Again? She gave you a year to make good on your end of the bargain and you consistently didn\u2019t come through. Not even for a weekend trip? I suppose that\u2019s fair but so is her decision to stop planning her life around when you can make time for her. \n\nETA: I\u2019d be willing to bet she did bring it up and you chose not to hear her but what do I know.", "Yta she waited a whole year for you to do something and you didnt. Not even a \"hey I unexpectedly have the weekend free pack a bag we are driving a couple hours away to see something we havent before!\" So no she isnt waiting on you or anyone else to fulfill her dreams. The fact you think that is immature says more about you. The entire situation from last year even had nothing to do with you. You took her resolution and made it about you and what you wanted with no care for her. You dont get to pause someone else's dream and get mad when they decide to stop waiting. Like she said if you want to join you can otherwise she is living her life and not waiting on anything or anyone. She already waited a year Shes done waiting.", "YTA. She waited A WHOLE YEAR for you to make her a priority, and you didn\u2019t. Now she\u2019s focusing on her own happiness \u2014 good for her. Get over yourself.", "YTA. She did communicate and tell you but the timing may just not be what you might have preferred. She might have also booked BEFORE telling you because it might be a repeat of last year - you discouraging her and the trip/s not happening at all.  \n\nIf it\u2019s about communication, why did you fail to communicate or plan with her when the trip would eventually be when it had been cancelled for a year already? Was she supposed to just wait? Massive YTA", "YTA. She wants to travel. Youre too busy. So your options are:\n1. Slow down and take time off to travel with her\n2. Let her travel alone\n3.

Sounds like she did you a favor. You're lucky she hasn't left you imo.", "She\u2019s waiting on initiative from you. You showed none. She told you it was important to her, almost sounds like her identity even. But you have nothing. YTA", "YTA. This was one of the early warning signals that my little sister was in an emotionally abusive relationship. Your partner isn\u2019t required to only travel with you and let you be a part of every decision she makes. Especially after YOU kept her grounded for a whole YEAR.", "YTA. She put her travel plans on hold waiting around for you to be free. You've made the mistake in assuming that just because 'she never mentioned being upset or anything about it before now' doesn't mean she's not pissed with you for making her cancel her plans. Good for her for doing stuff for herself without relying on an unreliable bf. You're really quite selfish in having stopped her and continuing to stop her traveling.\n\nAt the end of the day, she's only going away for a few weekends, not taking months off at a time.\n\n>Sucks, but there's always next year right?\n\nAnd the next year.\n\nAnd the next year.\n\nAnd the next year.\n\nAnd the next year.\n\nWhen does it stop?\n\nShe's done nothing wrong in taking control of the situation and doing something that she wants, which you seem to care little and have little time for. Your gf has the right idea of a work/life balance and set her priorities straight, you should think about that.\n\nYour gf has been very considerate that she made the plans and you could opt to join her. All you have to do is make the time to turn up. But judging by past instances, you're probably a flaky enough bf to cancel on her.", "YTA\n\n>Then she then in turn blew up on me about last year and the fact that I \"stopped\" her from traveling when I knew that was the one thing she really wanted. That before she cancelled she'd asked me again and again if I was sure we'd go and **I promised her we would** (which was my freaking intention!) and we didn't, so in her disappointment she decided from then on **she wouldn't rely on other people anymore to make her plans happen**. Immature IMO because I'm her partner not just people.\n\nYou promised her you'd travel with her and broke your promise (doesn't matter why, if you can't take even a single week in a whole year because things are hectic, maybe take a look at your priorities). She then in turn does the mature thing which is not relying on other people for her dreams/plans to happen, because you just showed her that your promises don't mean much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She said she didn't mention last year before because she didn't want to make me feel bad and hold it against me because she knew it was out of my control, decided she was just going to go for it in the future if she wanted something for herself and that's why she did it.  \nI especially can't stand how she is convinced she did nothing wrong whatsoever and I am the total asshole in this situation for blowing up at her the way I am when it's really the other way around.\n\nHow do you not see that you're TA in this situation? I respect your GF a lot in this story.\n\nYou basically blew up at her for not blowing up at you in the first place and instead just go ahead and book some trips. You blew up at your GF for being rational instead of confrontational.\n\nShe took direct action because the year prior you demonstrated to her that making plans together doesn't work. Why would she come to you about it again when the year prior you tried really hard to convince her not to make any plans on her own?", "YTA\n\nFrom personal experience, I've been married 21 years. He has a very erratic work schedule that makes traveling an iffy prospect. I LOVE to travel, but patiently waited for the first 10 years of our marriage to travel, but instead there were always reasons we couldn't go due to his work. I don't know how many weekend getaways had to be canceled last minute because of some crisis or staffing issue or broken piece of equipment. I understood he couldn't control these issues, but I also knew that if I never did anything to fill my own cup, I'd become very resentful of him. So I started planning my own getaways 11 years into our marriage, all of which he's welcome to join, but if he can't? Oh, well, I go without him. \n\nSo stop being a jerk. She's entitled to do things that bring her joy and she doesn't have to clear it with you first.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nYou intended to travel with her last year and told her to put off trips she wanted. And then never made it happen. She didnt blow up about it then because she didnt want to upset you. But she clearly doesn't want to be left at the mercy of your timetable for another year or more. \n\nShe is allowed to travel without you and doesn't need your permission. Just like you don't need hers, given you aren't financially linked it married and don't run a household together. \n\nI think it's ok to feel hurt that she didnt tell you about the holidays before booking them. But look at what happened last year; she told you, and you talked her out if going on holiday and she missed out all year. So she is afraid that you will talk her out if travelling this year also, and that she wilm never go travelling because it doesn't suit you. After all, that's what already happened. \n\n  Partners discuss things, but partners also don't get salty when their oartner has hobbies they don't share. They act as a team. Your half of being a team means recognising that when you couldnt travel all last year, you should have told her she could travel without you if she wants.\n\nJust because we cannot do something doesn't mean we deprive our partner of it. Both myself and my partner have gotten sick before group holidays with friends, and in both cases made  the other person go on without us. Because they shouldn't miss out just because we can't make it.\n\nTell her that you feel hurt, but then apologise for accidentally holding her back last year, and wish her fun on her travels this year. Make it clear in your actions as well as words that you aren't just trying to stop her from having a life outside of you.  If you have the funds and time for it, offer to join her on at least one of these trips.", "I don\u2019t understand why people come to this sub just to argue with a near-universal judgment. \n\nOf course YTA, OP. But why are you even here?", "YTA. You can go with her if you want. She has saved and this is something that she wants to do. You stopped her from doing what she wanted last year, and odds are that if she doesn't just grab the bull by the horns and book her trips without you, she'd never go at all. Now you have notice that you can take vacation time and join her, or not, but she is not disrespecting you or your relationship by planning the trips. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA. You're expecting her to hold up her plans until that are convenient for you. She gets to live the life she wants to live. Either join her plans or get out of her way.", "YTA. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA she can as Well wait years for you to have time and money", "YTA and don't prioritize your partner. Good on her for booking the trips because it sounds like you would just be holding her back from going again and obviously because travel is not a high priority for you or your partner's wishes, you don't go.", "Oh my god you are such an asshole. You start off by already being pissy that she would do *something* without you. Which she is allowed to do, by the way. You know that right? \n\nShe handled your blatant poor regard for missing her vacation incredibly well and you\u2019re still pissed. \u201cI would have been happy to apologize\u201d, so you didn\u2019t even fucking apologize after you ruined a trip that didn\u2019t even have anything to do with you to begin with? \n\nStop taking your \u201cpartner\u201d for granted, let her have a life that isn\u2019t attached to you and get the fuck over yourself.", "YTA You dont get to tell someone how to spend their money or time. Now, if she was spending your money on trips for herself, that's different. But you made her change her plans AND pay for you to go on a trip with her, then you ended up not going. You sound emotionally and financially controlling, no wonder he wants some time by herself", "YTA. You are embarrassing yourself. She told you that you can come along on the trips. She\u2019s just not going to wait around on you and lose another year of travel.", "YTA. In my opinion she\u2019s being incredibly gracious and considerate by still inviting you to her plans but you\u2019ve proven that you\u2019re not reliable, so why should she wait on you?", "YTA she is her own person, her life shouldn\u2019t be waiting for you to allow her to travel. She already missies one year why risk a second", "Fly free OP's girlfriend!! You've patiently waited a whole year. That's more than enough compromise on your part so good on you for seizing the day and making your travel dreams happen. \n\nOp, she told you about her travel plans last year. This year she's tired of waiting and booked them.  She can't count on you. If you don't like this situation, organize yourself and join her on these trips.", "YTA.  Honestly, good for her.  I'm proud of someone that I don't even know.  You don't own her and you're for sure no married.  She's young and wants to be free.", "YTA.  You are in fact, the total asshole.   She did nothing wrong whatsover and you are the total asshole.   \n\n\nGood for her for taking the initiative!      \n\n\nThis has nothing to do with you wanting to travel with her, or her not being in a 'partnership'.  This is you being controlling.    \n\n\nYou need to get your shit together because you are WELL out of line.    As in, if i were your girlfriend's girlfriend and she came to me with this story, i would tell her that she needs to seriously consider leaving your ass if you don't immediately shape up, apologize and commit to improving yourself.", "YTA she waited the whole year what more do you want. I hope she enjoys her trips", "YTA. \n\nI spent 7 years sitting and waiting for my (now ex) boyfriend to agree to go travelling like I had always wanted to. \n\nNow I do whatever I want to do without waiting for others to get onboard. My partner is welcome to join me if they want to but I'm certainly never delaying or cancelling plans for them unless there's an emergency.\n\nStop delaying your girlfriends dream and trying to control what she does. She will end up living in regret and will never look at you the same again, assuming she stays with you.", "YTA. Girl if you\u2019re reading this \u2014 you can do better!", "You starting a career where you cannot step away for even a weekend trip has nothing to do with your girlfriend being able to travel.  She made the same resolution as last year, so this should have come as no surprise to you.  You barred her from fulfilling her resolution, so she\u2019s doing the right thing and cutting you out of the planning.  YTA, and your resolution should be to grow a spine with your managers and prioritize spending time with your partner.", "YTA. Everyone else has covered it. Grow up and stop acting like you\u2019re the only one in your relationship who gets to decide things.", "YTA. Intentional or not, your insistence on not letting her go without you essentially meant that she couldn\u2019t go at all. It\u2019s not your fault that work was crazy but it is very much your fault that your work schedule impacted *her* ability to travel. You can\u2019t blame her for deciding to follow her plan of travelling with or without you. This is something that\u2019s clearly way more important to her than it is to you, since you prioritised work over it, so why should she put it on hold for your convenience? You\u2019re both adults, let her go on her trips and then join her when you have the time.", "YTA - what has happened is this:\n\n1) you broke a promise\n2) she decided that waiting for your schedule to travel is not in her best interests\n3) she made travel plans, informed you of them, and invited you to come along on any that you could make time for\n4) you had a fit because it wasn't arranged to your specific schedule and she might go and have fun without you.\n\nThat's very selfish.  If you were concerned with her wants and needs, you would have already figured out travel plans for the both of you.  Instead, you expect her to wait INDEFINITELY until you are available.  She is not obligated to do that, unless she's spending your money. And it sounds like you were the one who couldn't afford it.", "What...is she supposed to waste another year for another failed promise?  Na...as a wise man once said...\"shit or get off the pot\"...kudos to her for taking the initiative.", "YTA. She wants to travel, and could do so, but you convinced her you should only travel together. Then you bailed. For a year. Now she knows you aren't going to follow through and she's going to do what she wanted. You're free to join her, but when you bail, she's still going to go. You're very controlling and she's having no more of that. The immature one here is you.", "YTA. She, in fact, sounds like the mature one in this relationship. You talked her out of doing something that she wanted to do, and then never made good on your promise to travel with her. Not a good look, but things happen. In order to not get burned two years in a row, she proactively took steps to make sure she\u2019s able to achieve her goal. You got pissy because her plans did not center around you, and are throwing a hissy fit while accusing her over acting the way you are actually acting. I sincerely hope this is just a weird hangup, and you\u2019re not this controlling/solipsistic in the other aspects of your relationship.", "YTA\n\n1. You prioritized your job over her.\n\n2.

I'm baffled that after writing it out, you still can't see you're in the wrong here.", "YTA Dude. She's actually doing you a favor and booking travel for you because you keep pushing it off. I'm terrible about executing travel planing so I'll typically end up not going. Good to have someone taking action. And also, I've been the guy who's always waited around for others to go on trips, but they never get it together,  so again travel got put off. Now I do better booking my plans and going solo if I have to. Others are welcome join me, but I'm not plotting my life around flaky people anymore. GF is putting plans into action. If you don't want to travel and don't want to travel with her, just say that so she can go about seeing the world. And no that's not always next year...remember covid?", "YTA. She already delayed her travel plans because of you. What happens if you couldn't travel again this year? How long will she have to wait until you honor your promises? Your behavior is kinda selfish and controlling tbh.", "YTA. Your gf is prioritizing travel. She was kind and spared your feelings last year.

If she was to wait on you, she\u2019d never get to travel and it will/has already become a source of resentment that will destroy your relationship. Let her live her life and don\u2019t be jealous.

You aren't her parent.\n\nWhy does she have to travel with you?  A lot of people need that time and head space to themselves.

She waited for you and you did nothing to try to make things happen.\nYou PROMISED her you would make time to go traveling with her and you didn't.\n\nSo this is alllllll on YOU.\n\nShe is so beyond right to not rely on you and your broken promises and book this stuff herself.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo last year January my gf told me for her new years resolutions she was going to travel. She'd been talking about wanting to for years. She told me about a trip she had all planned out and was going on by herself. We just finished studies and started fulltime jobs so we both never really had money to travel before.\n\nAt the time I was against it because I really wanted us to travel together. So I suggested/insisted for her to not go on the trip and save/use that money for us to travel together instead since we couldn't afford to do both. She agreed.\n\nHowever work got pretty hectic (for me) and I was never actually able to take my vacation days to go on a proper holiday with her. She never expressed any regret or anger about it to me. It just didn't happen. Sucks, but there's always next year right?\n\nAnyway fast forward to today and we were again talking about new years resolutions and she dropped the bomb on me that she actually booked MULTIPLE weekend trips for this year already. Without saying anything about to me.\n\nI got kind of upset with her and she casually told me I am always free to come and we will still make travel plans together also. Like it's no big deal. I told her that's not the point and expressed a lot of hurt and anger about the fact that she booked it without telling me and seemingly didn't care about my opinion at all.\n\nThen she then in turn blew up on me about last year and the fact that I \"stopped\" her from traveling when I knew that was the one thing she really wanted. That before she cancelled she'd asked me again and again if I was sure we'd go and I promised her we would (which was my freaking intention!) and we didn't, so in her disappointment she decided from then on she wouldn't rely on other people anymore to make her plans happen. Immature IMO because I'm her partner not just people.\n\nI do get her disappointment but as I reminded her it wasn't intentional on my part, like completely beyond my control, and she never mentioned being upset or anything about it before now. I would have been happy to apologize or acknowledge her feelings if she came to me about it.\n\nShe said she didn't mention last year before because she didn't want to make me feel bad and hold it against me because she knew it was out of my control, decided she was just going to go for it in the future if she wanted something for herself and that's why she did it. So I said is that how it's going to be from now on then? Like 0 communication. Of course she isn't required to ask my permission to go but I think it should be talked about. That's how a partnership works. \n\nI especially can't stand how she is convinced she did nothing wrong whatsoever and I am the total asshole in this situation for blowing up at her the way I am when it's really the other way around.\n\nShe's reading this with me.

It didn\u2019t happen. The years are not endless. She wants to travel - she\u2019s going to. She said you are welcome to come, so I don\u2019t know why you are making such a fuss. If she didn\u2019t make her own plans, likely this year would play out much like last year. If she is reading this with you: enjoy your trips!!", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, we all have hectic jobs. That\u2019s on YOU to plan in advance and communicate with your employer in advance. How do you think it works for the rest of us? When you plan a big trip those days are non-negotiable once getting clearance from a boss.\n\nYou didn\u2019t prioritize the travel, something very important to her. You wasted her time and let her down. You talk about \u201clike, 0 communication\u201d - uh hello, do you realize that you are the one who didn\u2019t communicate last year? And she paid the price?\n\nAs a result, she made her own plans and said hey- if you\u2019d like to come the invite is open. And you\u2019re mad at her because\u2026.? Something tells me you\u2019re not the kind of guy to put in any effort to plan the trip anyways (as was exhibited last year) so why should she wait on you?\n\nYou\u2019d be the AH alone just for screwing her last year. But you\u2019re ALSO the AH for trying to control her and gaslight her this year. I say gaslight because you\u2019re trying to make her feel crazy for booking her own travel which is very warranted and normal even in situations that aren\u2019t yours. \n\nSo in my opinion YTA x2", "YTA.", "YTA. You should be happy she is pursuing her goals. Instead you are pouting because they don\u2019t accommodate you.", "YTA you couldn\u2019t make it on even a weekend trip for a whole year but kept promising you would. I wouldn\u2019t ask you either. Sounds like you have different priorities.", "YTA. She\u2019s allowed to go on whatever trips she wants to, with or without you.  If going together was such a big deal to you then you should have put on your big boy pants and started planning with her months ago for what to do this year.  You just didn\u2019t want to make the effort until the last minute and that\u2019s on you.  Take some accountability. You also sound awfully codependent if you think her going alone is \u201ctaking time away from us as a couple\u201d as I read in one of your comments. Not all experiences need to be joint you\u2019re still people outside your relationship and it\u2019s healthy to do things separately.", "I didn\u2019t have to get past your suggestion/insistence that she not go last year before knowing YTA. I went away for 2.5 months this summer for my dream trip.. know what my partner did? SUPPORTED my dreams. Which is what good partners do.", "YTA\n\nYou promised and didn't deliver. She's not waiting around for empty promises anymore.\nYes, you *intended* to go, but you didn't.", "YTA. Big time. In a partnership people support each other\u2019s dreams, even if they don\u2019t have the same ones. You should be proud you have a girlfriend who is independent and can follow through.", "YTA. Maybe strong independent women aren't for you. Kudos to your gf for going for what she wants. Life is too short to wait around.", "100% YTA BF, you need to apologize right away\n\ngo on your trips GF he doesn't have a leg to stand on. You tried and he is not reliable.", "YTA. You **don\u2019t** get her disappointment, not at all. You did not prioritize your GF last year. She has zero reason to believe you will prioritize her this year. Life is too short, my friend, to spend it waiting. Soon enough things like mortgages and kids will limit her and your ability to travel. She has every right to travel now while she\u2019s young enough to enjoy it. \n\nI strongly suggest that you stop complaining and find ways to join your GF on her weekend getaways.\n\nEDIT: And last year, it wasn\u2019t like the trips never got planned. They were actively planned and then you **CANCELLED** them. Dude, you are so much TA.", "YTA.\n\nShe said she'd wait for you last year. You never went so she's going on her own this year. And rightly so.\n\nWho's to say you won't cancel her trips for your own schedule this year too?", "YTA\n\nShe didn\u2019t book a backpacking trip for four months without your knowledge. She scheduled herself as busy for a couple weekends. Get over yourself.", "If you can\u2019t stand how she thinks you are the total asshole in this situation then you are prob going to hate all the YTA votes then. Because you are an asshole, kind of a massive one.", "YTA, dude. If she was going to \u2018hold this against you forever\u2019 and if it was truly zero communication, she would not have even told you about the trips until she was heading out the door, let alone invited you along.\n\nShe is communicating with you by letting you know these trips are booked, and that you are welcome to join her. Pick up on that message: she still wants you to be part of it.\n\nCircumstances aside, you dropped the ball last year, and she put her stuff on hold for you. Intentions mean Jack for this. All that is happening now is that she has taken steps to make sure that she can\u2019t be let down again (intentions are irrelevant), but still making room for this to be a thing for the two of you together.\n\nStep out of you own bubble for a moment: she isn\u2019t doing this to get back at you, or deprive you of time with her. She is doing this so she can experience travelling even if you can\u2019t always be there as well.", "YTA. You stopped her doing any of the traveling she wanted to and could have done because you couldn\u2019t go with. For a whole year. Without any sign of actually following through on going together. She is telling you about her trips, just after she\u2019s booked them and you can\u2019t stop her from making those plans. Get your jealousy and control issues in check. Why should you be upset that your gf is going to get to do something she\u2019s wanted to do that will make her happy?", "YTA. You stopped her from going last year after she put it on hold to wait for YOU. On top of that fact you have now put a downer on any trip you go on together this year because your immature behaviour will be in the back of her mind the entire time. Good job on the future sabotage of all couples trips.", "YTA. She is a full and complete individual with or without you and can make all the plans she wants to. You want a partnership but are prioritizing your wants over hers, and you want her to do the same. She did for a year, but now you're pissy that she refuses to continue. All you have done is teach her how to not rely on you, and if you keep it up you'll find she'll figure out how little she actually needs from you and might decide being single is better.", "YTA", "YTA. You said you would travel together, KNOWING it was something she really wanted to do, even made her cancel a vacation because your precious schedule couldn\u2019t be inconvenienced, and are surprised when she, a fully grown woman who is independent and earns her own money, decides to do what she really wants without relying on your already broken promises. AND you\u2019re throwing a massive tantrum because she can apparently think and act for herself, without needing to seek your permission.\n\nAnd since she\u2019s reading this with you, honey, welcome to your future. You get to decide if you want to stay in this relationship and give him the chance to change, or go live your own life until you find someone who wants to live it WITH you. But I would caution against moving in, buying a home together, or getting married until you\u2019re both sure that you can support each other\u2019s dreams and goals. Otherwise it\u2019ll be year after year of \u201cthere\u2019s always next year.\u201d", "YTA. She spent a whole year trying to do it your way. So it is fair this year she gets to do it her way. Plus she invited you to join if you could. She isn't saying you can not come instead she is informing you she has these trips planned and you can come if you can. \n\nIf you can't well she isn't waiting for you. Like seriously buck up or you will loose her. I have dumped my ex because of BS like this.", "Op YTA and if you want to fix this you better plan something ALL BY YOURSELF for YOU TWO TO DO TOGETHER. \nHow much more clear does it need to be? You are holding her back in life. Stop acting like the victim here. She did everything she could short of dumping you. \nAlso idk how old you are but I am in my thirties and if you keep working like this, you\u2019ll never have a successful relationship. You\u2019ll never have a relationship with any kids you may have. Only work. Get your head out of your butt and go thank her for not leaving and surprise her with a houseplant and a weekend vacay.", "She's not immature.  The fact that you're her partner and not just people makes you letting her down worse, not better.\n\nYou made her a promise and you broke it.

She clearly told you something was important to her and you put your wants and needs ahead of hers. She canceled her plans to accommodate you and you blew her off. So now she\u2019s trying to make sure her needs and desires are met on her own and still offered that you could go with her and you\u2019re upset with her? \nHuge selfish AH. \nThis isn\u2019t a communication problem, YOU have a listening problem.", "YTA. I\u2019m proud of her!", "YTA I hope your gf has some amazing vacations this year", "Sounds like she did the planning necessary since you werent going to and now you can decide if you want to take those days off to go be with her too. Idk why its hurting your ego this much.", "YTA. 1. Sure she could have communicated better but so could you. 2. You are just people. 3. Also, you sound like you\u2019re acting like an energy leech her. Let her have her plans. Make some travel plans together as well. Let her enjoy her trips alone for her own sake. 4. If you can\u2019t, break up and let her have her own life.", "YTA and she did nothing wrong. She waited around for a year and then decided to do her own thing. Good for her.", "YTA. She\u2019s convinced she didn\u2019t do anything wrong because she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Since when does being a part of a couple mean she has to wait to do things SHE wants to do, and is capable of doing ON HER OWN, until YOU can accompany her? Dude, if it\u2019s important to you to go with her stop making her wait. Figure it out. Make it happen. I applaud your GF for knowing life is short and doing what she longs to do, with or without you.", "YTA I may be biased because I did something similar to my husband. Work is work and if you can\u2019t take time off then let her fulfill her dream. Life is too short to put things off.", "YTA.\n\nyou said it yourself,  there's always next year, you can join her then. how about you take your leash off and let the girl travel. it's a few freaking weekends ffs.", "Yta. You\u2019re holding her back and next year is NOT promised.", "YTA. \n\nShes decided that she doesn't want to resent you or feel that she is being held back from her own goals and desire to travel so she booked some trips you are welcome to join on, and she wants to plan other trips with you. You didn't make it a priority to take vacation and plan any trips with her and you're mad bc she is living her life?  You are in a relationship but shes not obligated to only make plans with you to travel.  Get a grip.", ">Immature IMO because I'm her partner not just people.\n\nAre you though? You seem to be just holding her back.\n\nI particularly don't like how you're weaponising the idea of expressing your feelings to keep her in her place while you get to feel good about yourself.\n\nYTA.", "Dude YTA, you insisted that she not travel without you, yet you were never able to travel with her all year. She's talking WEEKEND trips-are you really telling me that you had no weekends all year that you would have been able to go on a trip together? Or did you just not pur any effort or initiative into making up for cancelled trips?\n\nShe hasn't done anything wrong- as you stated yourself, she doesn't need to ask your permission (even though you say it, you don't seem to believe it). She's obviously tired of you guilting her into waiting until it suits you as it isn't a priority to you in the same way it is to her. She's made a commitment to do something she really wants to do-you should be happy for her! She's booked in advance so you can plan to join in on any/all when they suit you and over and above that, take the initiative to make plans for other trips over and above that. I'm not really seeing the issue here? Would you prefer that she just keeps waiting for you and it never happens so eventually her resentment builds up and relationship blows up?", "YTA.", "YTA. I agree with her. It does not matter that it was not your fault: you proved yourself to be unreliable. You are the immature one here, because you are trying to cause drama about her fulfilling her wishes / plans. Relationships are not only about the two people building something together, but also treating your significant other like a separate human being that may have different wants and preferences. Trust me, it will blow up in your face one day, if you stop her from pursuing her dreams.", "YTA - partnership isn\u2019t prison lol. You couldn\u2019t go, **and regularly disrupted the plan with 0 plan to fix until convenient for you.**\n\nShe wants to travel, so why should she wait to do the things she wants for you to be available. **You** are the one being immature imo.\n\nTry to join a few of the trips or plan your own, but this seems like a tantrum to me.", "YTA.\n\nShe wants to travel. You prevented that from happening for *an entire year.* She is no longer waiting for the stars to align for your so very hectic schedule, and she is planning the trips she wants to take. You have a standing invitation to join her on these trips. Somehow this makes you angry?\n\nI've been in her shoes. If you wait for everything to perfectly align before traveling, you will never go. You have to make it a priority, and that's what she's doing. \n\nApologize to your girlfriend and be honest with yourself. If you don't want to travel, then don't begrudge her the opportunity. If you do want to travel, then make it a priority and follow through.\n\nTrust me, when you are in your sunset years looking back, your fond memories will not be of working weekends for some lousy employer.

She is simply saying she IS going this year no matter what.\n\nYTA", "Do you hear yourself?  YTA.  Ask yourself why she should be denied travel because you can\u2019t?

Stop trying to control her.", ">I got kind of upset with her and she casually told me I am always free to come and we will still make travel plans together also. Like it's no big deal.\n\nYTA. It is not, or shouldn't be, a big deal.  You go if you can make it, and you can make plans together when it works for you. It's not all about you.

She told you travel was a priority, and you either recognize that, or recognize that she's not the one for you.", "Do as you say, say as you do\u2026 she was very clear in her desires about wanting travel. You specifically acknowledge this, she\u2019s even mentioned solo travels before. So are you really surprised, or are you maybe envious?

Also, she didn't exclude you in any way.

You seem completely incapable of seeing the situation from her perspective. You continue to write the same responses over and over again.

If my aunt wants to do anything, she has to do it alone because he will always cancel. And I\u2019m talking just going out to eat or a day trip. She\u2019s seeing your patterns and your schedule is not going to stop her. So either find time to go or plan your own group trip with her on time you 100% have available", "I am married to a man like you. And I started booking my own trips either by myself or with a girlfriend. It is not fair that your GF misses out on what she wants to do because you won't commit to her. You are selfish and acting like a child. You need to decide what is more important to you. If \"weekends are the only time we have to be together\" then get off your ass and go with her! YTA. Pull your head out of your ass before your GF sees she is always going to be a lesser priority than anything else you have going on.", "YTA. Is she supposed to just wait her whole life for you to have the time? Just because your partners doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything together. She can take her trips and then she can take a trip if you if you actually make the time for her", "YTA\n\nYou did prevent her from traveling last year. After a few months you should have just told her to go alone and planned another trip somewhere together.  Your anger is very selfish", "YTA It sounds controlling. She wants to travel, and she has plans.", "Soft YTA. You had no right to change her mind about traveling so her reaction is completely understandable.\nI think your valid in your hurting because of how she went about this but you should be more understanding of her side and what she wants and not just what you want for the both of you. People keeping saying your controlling and manipulative and I don\u2019t agree. It sounds like you just want those memories together but just because she has some solo memories doesn\u2019t mean that the memories you make as a couple will be any less important and meaningful.", "YTA. You are her partner, Not her parent. Stop being so controlling", "YTA. She's your partner, not your underage child. She has to run precisely *checks notes*... fuck all by you.\n\n\nGood on her!", "YTA. For forcing her to cancel her plans and for acting like a baby when she decided to stop waiting on you and live her life. She gave you a year, you didn't deliver. Get the hell over yourself.", "Yes, YTA. You did not make time for her priorities, and now you\u2019re guilting her for sticking with them. You\u2019re even trying to control her! You had your chance, and if you continue like this she would be smart to travel away from you.", "In case you read this, i think the majority of people have already started why YTA in this situation. The only thing I can add is that you're looking for people to affirm your point of view, which is wrong. Your partner is free to do as they please. Just like you're free to choose if your work is more important than traveling.", "YTA dude. Everyone else has said it better. Get over yourself. She blew up on you because you insisted on rehashing an issue that they had already communicated was a problem. You were just choosing not to understand because it doesn't suit you. I would be frustrated, too. Suck up your natural consequence, apologize to her, and modify the behavior going forward.", "OP, you really are dense. YTA", "YTA\n\nShe tried to wait for you and your false promises.\n\nAlso. She\u2019s your gf, not your wife. In my opinion, there\u2019s not really an obligation to take you.", "She did nothing wrong. She is allowed to travel without your permission or even fucking taking to you. Yta.", "YTA - you're making everything all about you and making the choice to view her intentions in the worst possible light\n\nYou're not entitled to go with her to any of her trips just because you're dating; she's absolutely allowed to want to do things alone regardless of whether or not you even have the free time to go\n\nBut still, she waited a whole year for you, and every time you broke your promise. Guess what? Stop making promises if you can't keep them. Maybe you should have communicated better that despite your intention to \"promise\" to plan time off, you weren't sure if it was going to happen after all\n\nMan, grow up.", "YTA entirely. It really sounds like you're trying to curtail her freedom because you're insecure and don't want her going alone, which would be fine if you were willing to make time to go on trips WITH her. But you aren't. \"Work got busy\", my brother in Christ, everyone gets two days off a week and everyone gets at least a week of vacation every year, no matter what you do for work.\n\nJust admit that you don't want to travel so you don't want her to, either.\n\nI hope she has a blast on those trips without you.", "I was waiting for you to mention you lived together because it would change my answer. But as you didn't I'm going to assume you do not. So YTA. I could understand if it got in the way of bills or things. In this situation though, her going doesn't do anything to you aside from make you upset and I think you'll live if that's the worst that happens.\n\nI do think however your girlfriend definitely should have told you her feelings earlier because you deserve to feel bad.", "YTA if your job doesnt let you take vacations, its time to grow a pair and tell them you need vacations to properly function the rest of the year. Tell them the vacation is booked and theres no way you can stop it now. Stand up for yourself and value your relationship as much as your job. \n\nI also dont see the problem in her already booking short trips. Either you manage to find time and tag along or you dont again and then you at least dont stop her from traveling. You did show that you arent reliable so she just went and booked it. Take it or leave it.", "YTA. I hope your girlfriend has an amazing time on her travels without her controlling asshole (ex) boyfriend.", "YTA. You knew she wanted to travel and asked her to wait on you. Then you didn\u2019t make it a priority. Now she\u2019s made plans (she\u2019s even open to you going) your having a fit. Grow up. No one is required to wait on you. She has things she wants to do. Get with the program or get left behind.", "YTA. She wants to travel and she has every right to do so. You didn\u2019t care that you fell through on your commitment to travel with her.", "YTA. She told you a want. You even promised you would do this thing she wanted. Life happens while you're busy making other plans. She got tired of her not being a priority in your life. The fact you keep acting like she answers to you comes across as controlling. She told you what she wanted to do and gave you a year to make it happen.", "YTA. There isn\u2019t \u201calways next year\u201d. Your partner has a desire to do things now, and she deserves it. Clearly your work is more important to you than helping her meet her goals of traveling.", "YTA and you\u2019re holding her back. Good for her for deciding that she\u2019s gonna make it happen. I travel by myself all the time and love it. My thinking is, \u201cIf I have to wait for someone else to do something, I may end up waiting a long time.\u201d The fact is, she out her goals on hold for you and you let her down. Through no fault of your own, and that\u2019s why she understands about last year. But the fact you\u2019re trying to hold her back this year? Makes YTA. Because you\u2019d rather hold her back AGAIN to soothe your own ego then just, you know, work to make sure you can go on some of these weekend trips she\u2019s booked.", "YTA.  You say you want to go, but then prevent the whole thing.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t own her.", "YTA she doesn\u2019t need your permission to travel. She is not your minor child. You blew smoke up her ass to get her to cancel her travel plans. You had zero intention of traveling with her. Stop trying to hold your girlfriend back.", "YTA", "YTA I\u2019m with your girlfriend it took me missing one concert I wanted to go to to realize in not waiting for anyone ever again \n\nYou showed multiple times you\u2019re flaky and don\u2019t follow through. It\u2019s good she\u2019s not waiting", "YTA.  If you love her and want her to be happy, you will be thrilled she going to do what she wants to do and waited a year to do.", "YTA. She is taking steps to ensure her needs are met. That is the emotional maturity you want in a partner.now it\u2019s up to you to join her when you can. This is what having an independent partner looks like.it makes you stronger as a couple when you take the steps you need to to meet your needs also.", "YTA for a few reasons.  First, you are far too controlling for an independent person to want to deal with. Second, your involvement is all downside for her - you will only limit or kill entirely her plans to travel whether that\u2019s your intention or not.  Intention doesn\u2019t matter - your involvement hurts her ability to travel.  Third, you seem to feel entitled to her time, money, and decisions - you are not.  Fourth, you seem completely clueless to points one through three.", "YTA - you said you would do something and you didn\u2019t do it. Instead of recognizing that and apologizing you make it her responsibility to remind you about something you already know you didn\u2019t do. What\u2019s wrong with your mouth? Are you not capable of communicating ? I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do what I said I was going to do, it\u2019s been a whole year and it was a complete failure and I known how important this is to you and don\u2019t want to hold you back. I\u2019ll go when I can but baby make your dreamers come true. Wish you would have done that instead of laying on the guilt for your failure. Intent doesn\u2019t matter if you hurt the person regardless of intent.", "Tough titties. YTA \nShe booked multiple WEEKENDS. Get a fucking grip and understand that no, you can't just go \"next year\". She'll have missed out on sooo much waiting around for you.", "I mean you two have fundamentally different opinions on this part of your life.  She has stated she wishes to travel.\n\nYou don't have the means to accommodate this and insist she must wait.\n\nWhy exactly does she need to wait?", "YTA, you made a choice in your priorities without discussing it with her, & now your mad she is making one too.  FYI that job isn\u2019t going to visit you in the nursing home.  Also she is your partner not your child, she can do things without you", "Yta she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She\u2019s stated her desire and intentions and informed you of her plans before hand you sound selfish like you have to have sone control over this. You don\u2019t. She\u2019s free to do as she chooses and clearly you will continue to try to control her. Let it go or lose her.", "YTA. Just breakup, you\u2019re not mature enough to be in a serious relationship. A mature partner would have understood, and encouraged their partner to go, even when they couldn\u2019t, and instead you\u2019re throwing a tantrum?", "She wants to travel. She has a plan to achieve that goal.\n\n\nYou want to go with her. What is your plan to achieve that goal, without jeopardizing her own?\n\n\nThings went wrong for the first year. It happens. YTA now because you are asking her once again to risk her plan without any guarantee.", "YTA the fact that you know that she is going on trips is proof she told you. You don't get to demand to be told *in advance* of decisions she makes for herself with her own money. *Especially* not since last time she told you of her plans in advance you prevented her from doing what she wanted. \n\nI mean, what she did is not ideal. But maybe you guys will actually plan a trip together this year, you won't flake and then future plans can be *common* plans.", "Dude you sound codependent as hell. YTA, people are allowed to do their own thing.", "YTA YTA YTA! You derailed her plans last year by making promises you couldn't keep and now you are angry that she isn't once again waiting around for you to live her life as she wants to live it. That's controlling behavior. She assured you that you are always welcome to join her if you can. A gracious offer after last year. Partnership works both ways. But it is never about controlling the other person.  You owe her an apology for \"blowing up\" at her. And, if you want to keep your partner, you should probably find a way to make at least one weekend trip with her. AND, you should not only apologize but support her dreams of travel.  You are not her keeper.", "YTA.  I hope she has a wonderful time traveling.", "YTA, like your handle says, you appear to be dense and it apparently just got you canned \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nThe truth is you asked her to place traveling with you as a priority when you clearly didn\u2019t consider her wants as one. \n\nI don\u2019t care what anyone says but people make time for the things that matter to them. You chose not to make time for this trip. If your workplace is somehow so toxic that you cannot take a pre-planned vacation, you need to reset your boundaries. However, I think that\u2019s not the situation here. Your flippant attitude towards letting her down says volumes about how you view her needs in this relationship. \n\nLike you said \u201csucks but there\u2019s always next year. Well next year is here and it seems like you\u2019re the same inconsiderate partner so kudos to her for not relying on you.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t travel last year because of you and you\u2019re angry at her?\n\nHave fun, girl. You\u2019ll have a great time without this one pulling you down.", "YTA.  She wanted to travel last year, and instead wound up sitting on her hands all year because you insisted on traveling together, then couldn\u2019t get time away.  So this year she is being proactive.  Do you really expect her to wait around at your beck and call until you are ready to go on a trip?  Travel is obviously important to her, and right now your attitude is \u201cIf I can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it either!\u201d  It sounds like she\u2019d rather go with you if possible, but either way, she wants to GO, not spend another year sitting around waiting.  It\u2019s not the end of the world if your girlfriend does something without you, especially if waiting for you means she doesn\u2019t get to do it at all.", "YTA a huge one actually. She expressed her love of travelling and wanting to go alone and you stopped her promising to go with her and broke your promise. The circumstances for that being broken don\u2019t matter you promised her something and stopped her from her dreams and didn\u2019t deliver. \n\nShe\u2019s allowed to do with her money what she likes AND she even still said if you are able to get time off to go with her on the things she has booked she would be happy to have you! She does not have to check in with you to live her life and you are not married and don\u2019t share responsibilities like children. \n\nYou are being controlling in a big way. She\u2019s not doing anything crazy she\u2019s just taking a couple of trips by herself since promises were broken to her last year. Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep! You have no right to be mad when you already stood in her way once.", "YTA. You DID stop her from traveling. She is communicating with you now. She\u2019s just not relying on you. These are the trips she\u2019s going on, you\u2019re welcome to come or not. Time to put on some big boy pants and grow up. You\u2019re the immature one, not her.", "Mate you are being fucking ridiculous. You had your chance. She waited an entire year. You did zero planning. She books stuff for herself and offers for you to come with her and you are still complaining she is leaving you out. Stop being a butt hurt sook and either make some plans to go with her like she offered or stfu and let her go do what she wants to do. It is absolutely ridiculous for you to whinge and complain that you want to do these things together but then make zero effort to make it happen. She should still get to live her life when you are working, not sit around waiting for you to decide when she can travel.", "YTA. I travel by myself all the time because my partner lacks 1. Time and 2. Money. We usually take a weekend trip or two each yeah, but I\u2019m not going to pay his way each time just so he can be with me. \n\nGood for her. You proved unreliable. Let her have her fun. There\u2019s also a big difference between solo and romantic travel and I encourage her to do both.", "Info needed: you obviously are a spy, UN peacekeeper, brain surgeon who cannot book time off work - but then why didn't you tell her to go without you? Or could you just be an insecure controlling needy selfish duplicitous guy?", "YTA, she told you she wanted to travel, booked a trip, got all excited about it and you insisted you be included, guilted her into cancelling, and then never followed through getting the time off to do it.  Now she's booked trips again and you're throwing a hissy fit because she didn't include you?  You're the asshole.   \nAnd to call her childish when she didn't pick a fight about it the whole previous year is also being an asshole.  It's not her fault you're unreliable or demand to be the center of attention.  She's been the bigger person here.", "You know that you are 2 individuals, right?! \n\nShe is entitled to be her own person and fulfill her dreams!\n\nAs someone who gave up on everything to take a sabbatical year to travel around the world, OP's girlfriend, if you're seeing this, don't let him stop you!\n\nYTA", "YTA and if you aren't going to prioritize her happiness at least let the woman do it herself. You aren't what her world revolves around and a healthy relationship has two individuals working towards a common harmony, not one person holder the other back from living.", "YTA - it wasn't completely 'beyond your control'.  I bet in the past year you made time for your priorities - time with friends / computer games/ tv etc\n\nI suspect you were uncomfortable with the idea of her having solo experiences, spending her own money on things that you didn't approve of.   She had a plan and you 'insisited' she wait for you - she gave you a year which was more than reasonable. \n\nShe is now making herself a priority and dumping the crazy idea that you have a vito over her schedule. She has only booked weekends !  Whats the big deal!   I go on trips alone for weeks at a time.  She has all this money that SHE saved and she is spending it on herself.  I hope she has 52 OUTSTANDING WEEKENDS when she sees the life she can live SOLO\n\nI hope she has amazing trips and experiences, seeing things and having adventures with every possible gap of time, meets interesting people ....\n\nPerhaps with all the money you earn working, in this job that takes up all your time, you can take her on a longer holiday rather than expect her to take you on a trip", "SHE DID NOTHING WRONG. \n\nYTA\n\nIt would be better, long term, if the two of you could talk things through but by your own admission, your insistence and lack of follow up prevented her from travel in the past. \n\nHer decision to go for it in life and not wait around for others is actually an awesome thing. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention ages but I\u2019m guessing you are younger, so extra kudos to her for figuring this out young. \n\nShe didn\u2019t tell you because you would have found a reason for her not to go.", "YTA. After being disappointed with a few missed opportunities in my life, I decided I will do whatever I want, and if my spouse wants to join in, great! Intentions mean nothing, only actions count.", "YTA- you're also a bad partner and controller freak with FOMO. You're willingly trying to hold your gf back again for your insecurities. She put her dreams off for you by A WHOLE YEAR. Now your mad because she called you out on your bs and let you know what a disappointment you've been as a partner.  Your response? TO throw a temper tantrum and complain about how you dont have money to travel and how she needs to wait until you have money OR pay for you. Honestly your gf deserves better. Watch, next you'll try to get her pregnant to stop her from traveling without you.", "YTA \n\nWell done to her for actually booking it on her own. When you love to travel not going anywhere for a year feels like a long time. You\u2019re clearly indifferent to it and it\u2019s not as big a thing for you. You can come with her if you want to.", "YTA. Sorry but she's got her own life and you are not at the helm. The fact that she delayed her plans by an extra year for you should be evidence that she cares for you. Let her do her own thing, and if you're upset she didn't consult you first then you should look at what happened last year.", "YTA. I want to cheer her on. \nShe isn\u2019t going to sit around and wait to let someone else plan her life. She is taking the bull by the horns. You should be glad she said you can come along if you like. You blew it by not listening to her dreams and not keeping your word on something that was important to her.", "She wants to travel, she tried waiting for when you'd be available to go with her and she tried communicating her needs.  Now she's tired of waiting and has taken the initiative to get going.\n\nShe can't rely on you to make the effort so you either get on board or continue faffing.\n\nYTA.", "Don't make promises you can't keep. The moment you knew or noticed that your work is getting hectic, thus you can't do the travelling, you shouldn't have made any promises that \"yeah, we'll go\" when she made sure MULTIPLE TIMES that will you go next time. And then you didn't, if this was like only one time, fine it can be looked pass but multiple times? For a whole year? Hell nah. If you want proper communication you need to hold the quality as well and actually think about your partner too, because that's how partnerships are actually supposed to work. She communicated to you that she wants to do a lot of travelling, well you want to go with her, fair, but you didn't like the option that she would go alone, why? Anyways, she decided to respect your wish that you guys would do it together so she didn't go alone for a whole year and despite your empty promises, she didn't go. \nAnd I think she didn't tell you about booking the trips because she knew how you would react: you would be mad at her if she went alone and possibly asked her to wait, again. If you can't see your own flaws in this whole scenario, this won't work. She most likely would communicate to you better if you actually showed that you care about what she wants and her feelings.\n\nYTA", "YTA, instead of just accepting that you blew it last year and your GF was rightfully disappointed, your determined to blow it a second year instead of looking at your calendar and seeing if any of the days she\u2019s already selected work for you too.

Stop clipping her wings and let her do the travelling she's always wanted to.", "YTA I hope she enjoys all of her trips and loses the baggage weighing her down", "YTA Not being able to take at least some of your PTO days are red flags - either for your employer or you.

God, if my boyfriend got so mad at me for simply trying to treat myself and enjoy my life, I would not be getting on that plane ride home.", "YTA. She didn't travel for an entire year because of you. You claim to have more time now, but you work for a start-up, which means they will still be changing your schedule and asking you to put in more time on short notice because IT'S A START-UP. \n\nYou're controlling and throwing a tantrum.\n\nAnd you keep doubling down when people say YTA.", "YTA. You are supposed to be your partner's biggest cheerleader, encouraging her to hit her life goals not whining because you don't have the flexibility she has.

There\u2019s no arguing it away. And she is way, way too patient with you.", "YTA in a big way. You prevent her from doing something she\u2019s always wanted. Now you\u2019re petty and jealous that she\u2019s living her life. She didn\u2019t lie and tell you the day she was leaving.

Not once, not twice, not three times, hell not even 10 times. You didn\u2019t follow through on a promise for an entire year. Out of your control is bullshit.

Same old, same old... people prove you you can not rely on them, you learn from that and react by not relying on them and then comes the big waahh waaah waah as if their trust would have been broken or some shit. Listen, it doesn't matter what your intentions were, you promised, you didn't hold your promise, she reacted on that. And of course you thought sitting it out would be the strategy going for. Oh wow, she didn't bring it up the whole time. No, why should she? Was she the one breaking her promise, no matter why? Why is she the one who needs to ask for a talk about it?\n\nWhy should she ask? Not only did you prove her that she can not rely on you but your opinion wasn't needed. She wants to make these trips, you can come with her or stay home, but she is making these trips. She doesn't have to ask her baby boyfriend so he doesn't get butt hurt. She doesn't need to ask for your permission nir opinion if she will go anyway and I see no reason why she shouldn't, especially when she says that further trips with you can be added anyway.\n\n\nHow about learning from that and stop making promises you don't know if you can keep them?! And if you can't stand by your word next time seek a talk, apologise and ask for other plans instead of thinking you can sit that shit out, if you do long enough it will all disappear magically?!", "YTA. \u201cSucks, but there\u2019s always next year right?\u201d Until there isn\u2019t.

It\u2019s funny how you say you\u2019re upset that she didn\u2019t communicate with her, however, you never communicated to her last year about not being able to go on the trip(s). She had already expressed how important traveling was to her so you knew how disappointed she would be to no longer be able to go because of your schedule. Yet you didn\u2019t think to sit down with her and acknowledge her disappointment (don\u2019t try and say you didn\u2019t know she would be hurt)? That alone makes YTA but now you\u2019re throwing a tantrum because she planned some trips on her own? She has expressed how important traveling is to her and she knows she can\u2019t count on you to follow through with traveling plans. Good for her for not waiting around another YEAR to see if you will be able to find the time to go.", "YTA. I'm surprised she stayed with you, given your attitude. She very generously told you about the trips in advance and invited you to come along. Very kind and reasonable. And you are having a childish tantrum. If you both want to continue the relationship, you nees therapy to get to the bottom of why you feel the need to be so controlling of your girlfriend. And she may want to explore why she allowed you to be so dismissive of her for a year.", "YTA because she had one goal and she put it on hold for you.

If you really wanted to travel with her, you would have made plans. I don't care how \"hectic\" work got, you need downtime and taking a weekend or two off is necessary.

You for being the reason she didn't travel last year and not seeming to see the issue with how you handled that (not prioritising leave etc.) And her for not telling you before booking the trips and giving the opportunity then to be included.\n\nTo be clear, I think she's perfectly entitled to book trips and she's not obliged to tell you in advance, but maybe she should rethink the relationship if that's what she feels she needs to do due to your past behaviour.", "You need to grow up. YTA.", "YTA I\u2019m very confused why this is such a big deal for you. I\u2019ve gone on many trips with out my husband for much longer than just the weekend.

I can understand if you wanted her to mention it to you before she booked however, it seems like if she had done that, you would\u2019ve tried to convince her not to.

It's not like she's spending  two months at a massive football tournament.", "Yeah, I ended a relationship last year and this was one of the factors.

That is not wrong in itself, but it does not mean she should not travel either.\n\nMy verdict: YTA.
