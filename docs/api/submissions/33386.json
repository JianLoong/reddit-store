So I turn to Reddit, AITA for this?\n\nEdit for clarity: \nA lot of people have asked about their finances- she's just graduating grad school and he's a teacher who's been fired multiple times for hitting on his students (which is how they met) so they really are pretty broke\nI wasn't very clear earlier- he's made gross comments in front of my mother about how my wife should go into p*rn because she could legally portray someone underage. My mother is old fashioned and thinks this is \"boys being boys\". When both I and my wife told him how inappropriate that was and to knock it off we were \"ruining Thanksgiving\" and it was \"just a joke\" so we left and have been low contact the last year anyways.
