They're all sitting unopened, untouched, and collecting dust. I'm returning what i can for my money back. \n\nI (18F) am a very giving person. I show love through gifts. I tend to go all out; wrapping paper, gift bags, tissue paper\u2013 you get the idea. Most of the time, I do not care to get anything in return\u2014 but recently i have been trying to not be so giving to people that aren't deserving of my expenses and efforts. \n\nMy sister is 21. I don't know if it's because she is family or because of how we were treated differently as little kids, but every time i gift her something, i end up with an insane amount of guilt for the days following. \n\n2-3 years ago i bought her a ps4 game bundle that came with a figuring for christmas. 6 months ago for her birthday i got her some stuff for her nintendo switch. I'd understand if she kept them in the packaging as a collectors item, but they've all been sitting in the same spot in our living room since she opened them. \n\nMy sister has never gifted me anything without my mom telling her to. normally, i wouldn't care\u2013 but it's just hurtful that i put all this effort into her gifts just for them to sit and collect dust. \n\ni told my mom i was going to return them to get my money back. she told me it was rude. i don't think my sister would notice they're gone, but my mom is insisting on letting my sister know that i'm taking them back. i told her that was fine, as long as she tells her why i am taking them back.\n\nhonestly at this point i don't really care if i'm being an asshole. i just wanna know what others would do in my position.\n\nUPDATE: talked to her. gave her back two things and the third she's letting me take to trade in.", "created_utc": 1668103752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrn34k/aita_for_taking_back_gifts_i_bought_for_my_sister/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But taking back gifts is incredibly rude. Better to talk about it, and dial way down on the gift giving to her for chrostmas.", "NTA for wanting to return them, but they don't belong to you, so don't. But for the next birthday/Christmas, can you dust them off and give them to her again?", "YTA sorry.  A gift is just that.....it is no longer your property.  If you took them back without your sister's approval that's theft", "Your sister sounds like an ungracious gift received, but I'm afraid that YTA here. Once you give a gift, it is immediately and *permanently* out of your hands, and you have zero say in what happens to it, forever. \n\nHowever, I do understand your frustration, and there is an easy fix! From now on, give her no gifts, and give yourself no guilt! If you feel that \"something\" must be done to keep the family peace, give her a VISA gift card in a nice greeting card \u2013 or better yet, cash  (Cash is harder to put aside than a GC.) Then, she'll definitely use it, and she'll get exactly what she wants with it!", "YTA \n\nWhy spend $200 on her when you've seen the pattern for years and years? You wasted your own money.", "I mean. Why don\u2019t you just say to your sister, \u2018it seems like you never use [x thing], shall I try to sell it and we split the money?\u2019\n\nOtherwise, YWBTA. That stuff is hers now, and also, it seems like you\u2019ve made no effort to communicate.\n\nEdit to add: also, you say you put a lot of thought into her gifts, but these things clearly aren\u2019t stuff she actually wants. It seems like the gift-giving is more for your benefit. Stop buying her stuff.", "YTA. Once you give somebody a gift it is no longer yours to take back. If your sister is not making use of the gift you give her or showing appreciation, the only person you have to blame for the situation is yourself because you keep putting yourself in the same situation.

It isn't that I don't appreciate the gifts or the thought that was put into but I hate to stop using something just because it might be older but still functions fine. The gift I received makes me feel like the person is looking ahead for me to save me the trouble of finding a replacement & I like the gift even more because of that.", "YTA, if you gift someone something it's their property, you can't just take it back what are you even thinking? Just don't get her expensive gifts anymore and move on with your life.", "YWBTA\n\nyou gave her gifts. you don't get to decide how she does or doesn't use them. they're hers now. you really should have recognized this pattern a long time ago, and pulled way back on the gift giving before now. \n\nCut your losses and change your behavior for the future. \n\ngoing forward you would be perfectly within your rights not to get her anything at all, and if anyone says anything you can shrug and say \"well it never seemed like the gifts i got were wanted\" (this is a little petty but it sounds like your sister deserves it).", "YTA.  They're not yours to return.  However, PAY ATTENTION TO THE PATTERN HERE.  If she doesn't like or use what you're giving her, then you are not actually giving her thoughtful gifts that she would use.  Does she even play PS4/Switch?  Does she like the kinds of things that you got her?  Did you actually make an effort to figure out what she might want, or did you give her what YOU would want?  If she's just unappreciative for some reason, adjust your future gift-giving accordingly...give her smaller, less costly presents.  But there's a good chance that you're getting her things she doesn't even want or like, and not making enough of an effort to figure out what she'd actually enjoy.", "YTA. You gave it, so it's not yours anymore. But it seems like she's not interested in receiving gifts from you, when she's going so far as to leaving consoles you gave her in the living room even though she's a gamer.

You aren't considering the person you're giving the gifts to, and what that person's interests are. That makes you an asshole--it also means that your \"love language\" isn't about thinking about people and giving things people want, but about giving things that are really expensive to show off.\n\nI would talk with your sister before you did anything with these gifts though. Because they are hers now, no matter what her interest level in gaming is.", "2 part answer.\n\nPart 1: YWBTA because they were gifts. They\u2019re not yours anymore\n\nPart 2: fk it she wont know.

It sucks when you go to time effort and expense for someone  who is unappreciative. But once given a gift is a gift and it belongs to the recipient. If you take it back without permission you wouldn't just be rude you would be a thief. It doesn't matter if she is not using it or you think she wouldn't notice. They belong to her. What you can and should do is. 1. Stop giving her so many gifts that she seems to not want and 2. If you feel you need or want to buy her a gift make it less expensive and something maybe more useful. Ask instead of assuming and maybe make the gifts more practical. \"Hey sis your birthday is next month what would you like?\" Or Does she go to the movies frequently buy her a pass or take her OUT and spend time together tell her the lunch/ manipedi is her gift.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI think this is a matter where you don\u2019t feel appreciated or acknowledged. Thereby, seeing the gifts continually sitting untouched are evoking the reaction to take them back. \n\nDon\u2019t do it. Given what I\u2019ve read here, I think you\u2019d regret your actions in the long term. I feel like you\u2019d beat yourself up internally, wondering why you did that. \n\nThe real issue to me is that your sister doesn\u2019t give gifts without being told by your mom. How does sister act with you? Is she thoughtful in other ways? Can you talk to her about things?  \nIs it possible that she is envious of your gift giving style? These are just possibilities I\u2019m ruminating about.\n\nEdited to add a few words!", "YTA. You gave her the gifts. They no longer belong to you so taking them back without permission is essentially stealing. I think you may also be trying to hurt her feelings to retaliate for her hurting you by never buying you presents unless forced. You need to have a talk with your sister, communicate that this is something that bothers you. If he\u2019d behavior doesn\u2019t change, change yours and stop buying her things.", "ESH \n\n-On her end, It\u2019s really rude of your sister to continually disregard expensive gifts you\u2019ve bought for her. I would stop giving her gifts like this now. I\u2019d stick with giving her just a card. If you feel the need to buy something for her to open, I\u2019d keep the value around $10 & nothing over $15. \n\n-On your end, once you gift something it\u2019s no longer yours. \n\nThough if I was in your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t say anything to anyone about doing anything with the gifts you gave your sister. I\u2019d thoroughly hide them somewhere in your home for about 8-10 weeks. I\u2019d see if she notices and asks where they are. If she doesn\u2019t bring it up after 8-10 weeks, I\u2019d sell the least expensive. I\u2019d wait another 4 weeks, sell the next least expensive and so on. \n\nI do exactly this with toys my kids aren\u2019t playing with. I hide them in black trash bags for 8-10 weeks before giving them away just in case I accidentally picked up a toy they really do love. I figure if they don\u2019t notice it\u2019s gone after 8-10 weeks, it\u2019s fair game to donate.", "YTA. You know how she is and still chose to spend that money on her. When a gift is given, it is that person's gift to do what they want with. Consider the $200 the gift and move on. Gifting should never be done with an expectation of getting something in return, otherwise it isn't truly a gift.", "Don't. Let them stay there and let it be a reminder for you that she doesn't want and doesn't appreciate your gifts. Let it go. Returning them now would just give her reason to start a fight with you over touching her stuff. Let it go and stop getting her gift. No Christmas or birthdays. Move on.\n\nESH. You for expecting a different result when she's been doing this for years. And her for not telling you to stop.", "YTA - gifts aren\u2019t supposed to come with conditions. You\u2019re saying that because your sister wasn\u2019t sufficiently grateful or isn\u2019t enjoying the gift in the way you think it appropriate, you\u2019re taking it back. It sounds like you didn\u2019t get her a gift, you got her an obligation that she never asked for.  If you don\u2019t enjoy getting her things then don\u2019t do it in the future, but giving a gift doesn\u2019t entitle you to dictate how the recipient behaves.", "1. You can't take back gifts.

I understand the frustration and the perceived wasted effort on your part, but to be honest that's not the point of gifting. Gifting does not come with stipulations such as the receiver must show gratitude, the receiver must use the gift, and if the receiver doesn't, then you take it back. Out of respect the receiver could show gratitude and use the gift, but that's not guaranteed.\n\nYou can't gift SOMEONE something for THEM to experience, and then expect for THEM to have the experience YOU want.  \n\n\nJust ask her want she wants for presents.

You can't be an asshole unless you act on the desire get your money back.  Once a gift is given the giver has no claim.   The question arises ... why do you keep beating your head against the wall and then feel guilty about it?   Sister is an asshole who doesn't deserve your consideration or kindness.", "YTA. Once you give someone a gift, it\u2019s their property. You can\u2019t just take it back, but you can stop getting her things that are expensive/going to collect dust. \n\nI had to personally learn that the hard way when my sister wanted a Baby Alive doll\u2014she absolutely begged for it. But she was never good with taking care of dolls. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, I was able to find one for her and gave it to her for Christmas. The problem was, after I gave it to her, I noticed she took very poor care of it; it was broken after two weeks. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take back the gift and it was on me because I knew her pattern of destroying dolls yet got her one anyway. But I stopped getting her things that she said she \u201cabsolutely wanted\u201d unless  it was something she genuinely loved and I knew she was going to take care of. We tried again years later when she showed an interest in cooking and she actually took care of a cookbook I brought home for her. \n\nJust because your sister likes games doesn\u2019t mean she wants consoles. Try asking her what she would like or pay attention to her hobbies and get her something that pertains to the hobby that isn\u2019t expensive (for example if she likes Pok\u00e9mon, maybe get her a plush animal of her favorite one).", "YTA.

Ask her if she doesn\u2019t like the gifts you get her? Ask if there is another thing she\u2019d like better in future.

I don\u2019t recommend it if you want to have a real relationship with your sister. \n\nI get the frustration, but the intention behind giving gifts should never be what you\u2019re going to get out of it from the recipient. You may love getting and giving gifts, but that\u2019s not what your sister is about. You\u2019re making it about you, but have you ever tried to reflect on what your sister\u2019s love languages are? I can tell at least this much from what you\u2019ve shared: it doesn\u2019t seem to be material things. It\u2019s nice of you to want to be generous, but it\u2019s selfish of you to demand that someone else be grateful for something that isn\u2019t important to them. \n\nHave you had a conversation with her about what she would ideally like in terms of a gift? Maybe it\u2019s a gift card, having something done for her, self care, a meal out, or quality time like a hike, playing a game, or watching a movie? \n\nJust like a recipient isn\u2019t required to love a gift they don\u2019t want, or to reciprocate it, the giver is not required to do exactly as the recipient would like. Just keep in mind that when you have expectations of how your gift should be received, will sometimes be let down. It\u2019s not the responsibility of the recipient to behave the way you expect. Save yourself the time and money, have a real conversation, and move forward in a way that can satisfy you both, and possibly strengthen your relationship.", "Maybe she will get around to playing the games. Maybe she hasn't gone anywhere that she would need the carrying case. Why not explain to her that it seems strange that she says she wants the games. If so, why haven't you played them yet?

It\u2019ll build your relationship and strengthen it in the long run, rather than you feeling let down that your sis isn\u2019t outwardly thanking you for the tangible gifts you\u2019re giving.", "So, how do you think you make her feel when you give her gifts that indicate you haven't even considered her interests or who she is?", "No one else can make you feel a certain way. Change the way you think about it and your feelings will change too. Maybe gifts are your love language but not hers. If you\u2019re giving something for a certain outcome then it\u2019s not really a gift, it comes with expectations and strings attached.", "That's your issue to deal with, not hers.  You're trying to get back at her for feelings you have.\n\nHave you thought about talking to a therapist? They might be able to help you understand why you give gifts then feel guilty about it.\n\nThis isn't about the money, there's more to it going on here.\n\nYTA", "She can't make you feel anything.", "Have you talked to her about it, I hate getting gifts, and I'm sure I have offended more than a few people by being unappreciative. If asked I say please don't buy me anything, maybe a coke or single piece of chocolate but anything  past that makes me uncomfortable.", "the game i got her 2 years ago was overwatch, she had been watching game play so i thought it would be a good gift, but i can see where i went wrong w that one. birthday gifts were a charger station for switch joy-cons and a carrying case, both of which she wanted. she likes all things nintendo, as well as dangan ronpa (hope i spelled it right) and the persona games", "> Why leave that value sitting there in the living room untouched?\n\nBecause it doesn't belong to OP", "Because they're HER gifts? When you give a gift, the instant the other person has received it, it becomes THEIR property.\n\nThis person isn't just TA, they're also an indian giver and a thief!", "if my sister brings it up to me i'll explain to her my reasonings, and give her a second chance.", "u don't understand. she loves video games, on console and computer. our whole living room is filled w her gaming stuff.", "She prefers story-driven dark Japanese RPGs and you got her a shooter, no surprise there.  As for the charger station and carrying case, if she's actually just not using it though she claimed to want it, she's a little spoiled.  IMO both (a) think about your gifts a little bit more and (b) just don't get her as much this xmas.  If she complains, point to the unused birthday gifts.", "Asking as a genuine question not as an accusation.\n\nIsn\u2019t calling someone an Indian Giver racist/derogatory?", "no you can\u2019t do that. You gave her the gifts. They\u2019re hers. if you take them back, that makes you a thief. It doesn\u2019t matter if she doesn\u2019t touch them or do what YOU want her to do with them, they are no longer yours.", "Here, I'll give you an example. When I was a teenager, I was into reading science fiction and fantasy novels. When people asked me what I wanted as gifts, I would give them the names of series I was reading, and the names of books I wanted, the names of authors I read.\n\nAbout half my relatives then went out and bought me romance novels, or YA Christian bullshit novels which I typically immediately trashed or sold to the used book store in our area without ever reading.\n\nGifts which don't take into account the interests of the person you are giving them to, aren't gifts the person is going to be using.", "Did she want or need more stuff, or this particular stuff? I mean, my kid is into gaming, but someone gave him an Xbox + game bundle that has been sitting gathering dust for years because he's not into Xbox or wanting to play any of those games. Different consoles and games have different followings.", "she likes splatoon and fortnite (though i'm pretty sure fortnite wasn't around at the time) so i figured she'd like it, but oh well.", "got her a joy-con charger for the switch which she had mentioned wanting, also her own carrying case for it since i had been sharing mine with her.", "YTA. i understand that it hurt your feelings about how your gifts were being treated. however it\u2019s not up to your sister to give you the response you wanted to the gifts you bought. she didn\u2019t ask for them you got them because you wanted to, so at this point those aren\u2019t your gifts to give back just because she didn\u2019t give you the reaction you were hoping for.", "NTA\n\nShe obviously doesnt value your gifts so just stop. Find out what she actually likes and gift that way ex maybe she prefers experiences or just stop getting her things that she obviously doesnt want", "YTA. They're not your things, you gave them to her. Whether she appreciates them or not, you're stealing from her. Why not talk to her about this? It sounds like there is something going on here that you're not getting, like maybe there is something about these gifts that she doesn't like, or they're overly extravagant and she feels guilty she can't give you something of comparable value. Talk to your sister, and listen to what she says, and keep it in mind before you buy her another gift", "Id ignore the sister and get her a $25 gift card for every birthday and holiday moving forward", "YTA. As shitty as she sounds that is no longer your stuff and you'd be stealing from her. Just don't get anything for her from here on out.", "NTA. I completely understand. If your sister can't appreciate your efforts, then take it back. She's not using it. It's literally there getting dusty. I doubt she'd even notice.", "just get her socks", "I would move them, see if anyone noticed, and if not regift it at every birthday and holiday.", "INFO: Does she do this with all gifts or only yours?", "> she told me it was rude\n\nIt's not rude. It's theft. Once you give something to somebody, it's theirs to do with as they wish. She could set it on fire if she wants BECAUSE IT'S HER PROPERTY. \n\nYour only option is to no longer buy her anything. Stealing her possessions and returning them to get the cash because you don't like the way she treats them is illegal and morally wrong.\n\nYTA \n\nYTA", "It seems some history between you two sisters is missing from the post. I think your sister\u2019s attitude towards your gifts is coming from somewhere deep. Does she do this only with your gifts ?

Maybe in the future you could find some other outlet for your gift-giving, someone who needs something and would really appreciate your thoughtfulness.   Your sister doesn't need anything more from you though and I think you'd be justified not to get her any more gifts.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister is rude to accept a gift then not even open it.\n\nBut really, you're bringing this on yourself, she doesn't buy you gifts, nor does she seem to want the gifts you give her, so read the room and stop buying her things.", "INFO: Do you ask her what she wants for these gift occasions?", "NTA. What I would recommend doing is taking that money and donating it to another family in need and let her know that her gift was giving to others that need it and appreciate it, that would be a great learning lesson", "Yeah, and 5. I\u2019d stop buying her gifts.", "If you arnt using them and they are collecting dust, you don't deserve the gifts.", "NTA. Stop wasting your time and efforts with someone who clearly doesn't care.

Do you typically ask her what she wants for birthdays etc?", "INFO: \n1. Why do you feel guilty after you give her gifts?\n2.

My dad is similar. Hell ask for expensive ass gifts only a week before, then never use them. $200 hedge trimmer still in the box. Got him a tv a few years ago and it stayed in the box for TWO YEARS!! Power tools, smoker, sound bars, he\u2019ll for all this stuff and never use it. But if we don\u2019t get him anything, he\u2019s pissed as all hell!!
