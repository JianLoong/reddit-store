He didn\u2019t really have a plan, just wanted me to come over and \u201cchill\u201d. I told him I would be down to hang out. Now the day of, I had another guy hmu with plans and ask me to be his Valentine. This guy actually had a restaurant picked out and told me what time to be ready to pick me up. I ended up going with the second guy because I liked the effort he put into making the day special for. He arrived with pink roses and was just a complete gentleman the whole day. Now the first guy is messaging me and is mad at me because I stood him up. I know it was mean but I wanted a little more effort put into dating me besides just \u201cchilling\u201d. Am I the Asshole for that?\n\n\nEdit: I apologized to him and explained what I\u2019m looking for in dating someone. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re compatible in that aspect and I told him so. He seems to be ok with it and accepted my apology.

Instead of saying no you want something different, you agreed to his idea of spending Valentine\u2019s Day with you. Okay. \n\nYou then proceed to speak to a completely different man who invites you out last minute with plans you wanted. You go out on a date with him and ignore the first guy entirely. No message, no call, no last minute cancel of any form because you didn\u2019t like his idea of spending Valentine\u2019s Day even though you said yes to it earlier. \n\nWere you trying to punish him for not putting any effort? It sounds like you\u2019re not dating either of them. It was just a Valentine\u2019s Date. It just seems cold, if not plain petty to not say \u201chey, I made other plans, sorry it\u2019s last minute, Happy Valentine\u2019s Day though.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to be nice. \n\nI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re putting expectations on a date when you agreed to just hang out with the person. I don\u2019t know why you couldn\u2019t cancel so at least the guy can find a last minute date to spend time with on Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s a hard enough holiday on single people and it makes it a whole lot harder when they make plans with someone who doesn\u2019t show up because something better came along. Honestly, you owe the guy the most sincere apology because you definitely screwed him over on a holiday big on couples because I can guarantee he\u2019s hurting from being all alone on the one day everyone\u2019s says you shouldn\u2019t be.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s never cool to just stand somebody up, but this is literally what dating is for. The guy who puts in actual effort is going to come out ahead.

Nothing wrong with taking the better offer, especially when your first date knew that you weren't happy with his ideas, but you chose to make plans with him so you had an obligation to cancel if you weren't going to make it.  \n\nIt's not like you had to make plans with the first guy.  You guys clearly were not on the same page, so if you had said \"Idk, this isn't what I'm looking for so I'd like to keep my options open\", you would have been fine.  But you CHOSE to make plans when you thought he was your best/only option, so you owed him a heads up when you changed your mind.", "You\u2019re NTA for wanting more effort and making a decision but you are TAH for standing him up.

You want effort for you but can't make it for another? You're bogus AF for not at least telling him you weren't stopping by.

Hell you could have even lied. \"I'm getting a migraine & going straight to bed I have to cancel.\" Just ditching is asshole territory.

You don\u2019t just ghost someone you made plans with. If you choose to do something else that\u2019s your prerogative but to just stand someone up isn\u2019t cool. You never know if guy number one might have actually put an effort into coming over but wanted to surprise you. Either way you owe a fellow human the respect of not wasting their time.", "Ouch.", "Then perhaps you should work on that before you actually date someone.", "Love & learn. No one is perfect. If this ever comes up again just remember YOU wouldn't want to be stood up. It takes two seconds & just a bit of bravery to send a quick \"hey can't make it super sorry!!\" Text. Confrontation sucks but sometime it's necessary. Best of luck!", "And you're the one who didn't set expectations or communicate what you wanted. The other guy better run for the hills cause it's only a matter of time before you do the same thing to him as well I'm sure. \n\nValentine's Day is a greeting card created holiday.

Maybe he's just simultaneously terrible and good at planning. But failing to ask sooner is a red red flag.\n\nETA - no one suggested he didn't get the flowers day of, just the possibility they weren't originally for you.  As for getting reservations day of at a nice place on Vday, maybe...

You\u2019re setting yourself and other people up for a world of hurt.", "He was probably quite bummed but he'll also probably make a full recovery.\n\n\n I hated telling people I didn't want to go out with them anymore in my single days & I ghosted a couple of people to avoid the conflict myself, so please don't think I'm pretending to be perfect!\n\n\n Now you know to communicate with your potential partners that you'd like an actual date, not just a hang out. AND you've learned to send a brief message cancelling to anyone you've changed your mind over. You're allowed to change your mind!

I apologized to him and he accepted it.", "I really appreciate you being kind and giving me actual advise.", "I\u2019m just not into the chilling at home because they always think it\u2019s time to have sex.
