They should not have put a window ac in without discussing it with you first. You need to have a discussion with them, about the rent and the ac, before removing it. 71 is not very cool for sleeping and just because the thermostat is set to 71 doesn't mean that's the temperature throughout the house.

They are still at an age that they can be young and dumb about a lot of things or caught up in their own problems.   Maybe they don't realise how much those things cost to run compared to the house AC.  Maybe they thought they were being helpful by not complaining if they were too hot.    Maybe they assumed you'd take rent in arrears as it was family and you were helping them get back on their feet.\n\nTalk to them.  Get on the same page.

I would add a clause to their \"agreement\" now that says if they are late 3 times in rent payment, they have to go. There are two of them.

Taking on 2 adults into a household changes water, gas, and electric bills the minute they move in. I do not find 71 too hot to sleep in. If they don\u2019t like the temperature in YOUR house they can find someplace else to live. Coming into your home and expecting to run up excess electricity is disrespectful.

He's grown.\n\nAs for the window unit, if they're paying rent, contributing to groceries, and/or paying utilities, there's no reason they shouldn't have a say in their accommodations. You can easily explain the potential extra electric cost and come to a compromise, like only running it part of the day.

Did they insulate around the ac unit?  I\u2019d be telling them to take it out and talk to you like adults and pay rent like adults. If there\u2019s an issue that needs resolving and you all think that\u2019s the best way (like some medications and health issues affect the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature) then they can put it back in. For the record, there are non-electronic cooling mats that are great for helping hot sleepers keep cool (usually marketed to animals but good for ppl use too).", "She better be doing some chores and shit", "That's not always true depending on the house. My parents' house is over 100 years old, and the AC really only works downstairs. All the bedrooms are upstairs, and definitely need window units in order for someone to sleep comfortably. Otherwise the temperature can easily get over 90 during the day in the summertime, even if the AC is set down to 70. The opposite happens during the winter, so the downstairs is warm but the upstairs is freezing.", "And I'm sweating at 71.  People are different.  Who'd've thought.", "It's crazily hot, especially in summer. I need no higher than 64 to sleep, better a bit lower. And if the parent doesn't know what temperature their child needs to sleep comfortably, they are bad parent and no wonder a grown-up child resents them and doesn't consult before making their own life comfortable.\n\nThat said, they should pay rent. But why is OP expecting it after a week? Isn't rent paid like, monthly, or it's different when you charge your own family? OP should just tell them that whatever increase in their usual monthly elictricity bill is on the kids, and let them keep their effing AC. OP never was concerned about which temperature her stepdaughter needs to be comfortable in her own house, why start now?", "Ahaha yeah that would definitely do it. It's like my living room, we couldn't figure out why it was so much warmer, and then we realized duh, it was the pilot light in our fireplace. \ud83e\udd23", "Some people have different requirements for their sleeping comfort. For me personally, I can't sleep in any space that is above 68\u00b0.", ">It was plenty cool with the ceiling fan on.\n\nFor you; they may want it cooler.", "Oh dear. The stepD and her BF need a lesson in growing up and taking responsibility for themselves. The AC unit probably cost them the same amount as the token room and board they should already have paid you. \n\nAnd they brought along a dog you are also supposed to feed? You are being more than generous. \n\nBecause of their presuming to install the AC unit without checking with you AND not yet paying room and board, I'd take the opportunity to sit down with them and work out terms and responsibilities in more detail. I wouldn't leave it up to them to just \"know\" the right thing to do.\n\nJust a few examples to consider: they must both work, or at least one must work if the other is in school; they must help clean the spaces they use; they must make sure the dog is walked, cleaned up after, and treated for flea prevention, and so on. \n\nBecause of stepD's past history when living with you and her Dad, I recommend documenting these terms and responsibilities so that you can all refer to them. There are lots of templates and ideas online.\n\nThis would be similar to a rental agreement and good preparation for their futures.\n\nIn addition, I'd consider not having them in the room next to yours unless you have very good soundproofing. Then again, maybe they'll move out sooner if they feel embarrassed.\n\nGood luck.", "She\u2019s your stepdaughter I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s being charged rent to live at home with her dad I would ask for a contribution if I really couldn\u2019t afford it financially but otherwise it\u2019s whatever that\u2019s my kid. I could be 40 years old and I wouldn\u2019t get charged rent by my parents if I moved back. I guess it\u2019s a cultural difference?", "You sound like an AH here. What exactly are the TERMS of WHEN she would start paying and / or when payment is due. If you\u2019d like to get TECHNICAL, you pay July rent BEFORE you move in. So you let someone move in without payment. You\u2019re a bigger AH if you didn\u2019t lay out terms / stipulations/ timing of payment.\n\nWith that said, for the underlying post, I\u2019m going to say NTA. The reason they put in a window unit in a centrally air conditioned house is confusing and to your point drives up costs (not sure if they\u2019re paying utilities). You are a bit of an AH for not having a conversation with as to why.\n\nAlso 71 degrees seems reasonable and comfortable depending on your home (not all homes have great insulation). I would recommend, putting in a digital thermometer (not install just buy a small cheap one) to see if your temp is even throughout your house.", "Maybe offer a compromise? My youngest has a small dehumidifier in their room. It barely uses any electricity, relatively cheap off Amazon.\n\nLowering the humidity makes the room feel more comfortable in combination with a ceiling fan. We also use central AC, but it doesn't always do a great job lowering humidity, which can make a room feel \"stuffy.\" Our windows wouldn't be able to hold an AC unit, so that was another reason we opted for this. \n\nI'd only think you'd be TA if you don't have a conversation about this. Ask them what they got the window unit for and set a more firm deadline to catch up on the rent. If paying rent once/month is too hard to budget, maybe charge biweekly and split it.", "Maybe have a technician come in and assess your central system to see if it needs to be adjusted.", "Thats a thought but im hoping they brought it from their old apartment.", "I just got one last summer for 100 and they could have used credit to buy it rather than cash.", "If either of them are in school I\u2019m guessing they got it from their school\u2019s free-or-for-sale (or equivalent) for, well, free, or a hefty discount. Or as suggested they already owned it. Or from a friend or family member or coworker or\u2026 but I doubt they paid full price for the unit.", "Do you know they pay for it or was it given to them by a friend, family member etc? I understand you being upset honestly, you thought you were getting paid and you didn't. However, by discussing with them the points I mention or at very least an open conversation with all four of you before acting out of emotions, it will help you get better clarity whether you are being used or if they are just trying to get by in their current situation. You said they help with groceries so at least there is a willingness there to contribute to the home at very least. Also consider a written agreement, made and signed, by both parties as if they have every intention to pay their way, it wouldn't bother them and worse case, you got a signed agreement for disputes. Hope this helps.", "You can get a window unit on craigslist for well under a hundred bucks.", "Most people here keep their AC at 78 or above. Summer electric bills can quadruple from winter bills.\n\nDesert SW US.", "I do plan on talking to them, but I seriously also wanted some perspectives that removed my feelings. I don't want to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. I also know I'm in my feelings and I can't be when I talk with them.", "To answer the question of \"Used how?\"\n\nBecause it's only been one week and it's exactly the way it was when she lived with us before. \n\nI don't have the words because when I type them I sound heartless.  But I am not. I love her like she was my own.  I want her to make good decisions and be able to take care of herself both mentally and physically. I want her here because at least I know she's safe. (I'm not a fan of the boyfriend, but that's a whole other problem)\n\nI guess I just feel like she either doesn't want those things for herself or, even scarier for me, believes that she is.", "In almost every other circumstance, I would agree with you.  My husband and his daughter have a very fragile relationship. She knows that she is basically the only person on the planet who can hurt him, and I have witnessed her do it.  I know that part of his rationale is based on the fear of how she will lash out.  \n\nTyping that last sentence was an eye-opener for me.  I am going to really consider what that means.", "Agree. I like 62 in the winter and deal with about 65 for AC.", "Yes, this.\n\nOP, you can definitely out-petty them if you want.  But like.  Why?  Currently you all live together.  Going into the matter by at least \\*seeking\\* to understand, even if you eventually decide \"your house, your rules\" might get them to do what you want more than laying down the law does.\n\nEdited to add: young people often don't think about the electricity.  I certainly wouldn't have at that age.  Meet them where they are, and see what can be done.  They might surprise you.", "'Our adult tenant, who is refusing to pay rent, has just installed a several hundred dollar air con in their window that will increase our bills and prevent our central air working correctly.

The difference for my SD is that she is not responsible. She doesn't hold a job. She has a dog she doesn't take care of. \n\nIn the past, she has screaming fits at her dad about needing to be treated like an adult.  She very much believes that the way she should be treated is based on her age and not her behavior.  \n\nBTW, I also love this girl with my whole heart.  That's why she's here. I want to help her become the adult she craves to be. But I don't want to be a doormat either.", "100% charge them rent. \n\nHere in Ireland as you\u2019re 18 you start to pay at home. Not a huge amount of course, but it helps build a sense of responsibility.", "I absolutely made sure to layout terms before she moved in.  There is zero reason for them to be surprised at paying rent on the 1st, which is they day they moved in.  I clearly laid out in writing what rent would be ($300), when it was due (1st of each month), and what it included (a bedroom, use of the entire house, utilities and 1 meal - obviously they are free to eat, the one meal is where I provide the meal).  I also laid out that they would need to contribute to household chores.", "That is my plan, either an additional, more powerful fan. Maybe even taking the central air down a degree or two.  I hope to settle on a combination of the two. I never thought of a dehumidifier, so I'm going to look into that.  It's super humid where we are.", "That's actually what my husband does.

My own dad lost his relationship with my sister due to fear of her reactions. Parenting is definitely not for the faint of heart! Also, for what it\u2019s worth, 23 year olds are not adults. Most of them are trying their best to be adults, but they often miss stuff that seems obvious to us old folks. It\u2019s entirely possible that she knows zero about how much electricity a window unit uses, and thought she was being responsible by solving the problem without requiring you to lower the overall temp of the house.

I wonder what else you have no idea of about her. But anyways, a person, who buys and installs a personal AC without bothering uncaring parents looks pretty adept in adulting to me.
