No.\n\n\nModeling bad behaviour and inflicting hurt will not get the desired results.", "Nta, if they were renting they can\u2019t just put one in, it can damage the window and run up the bills.

Clearly money is an issue for them and you knew this ahead of time before they moved in.\nSecondly, they don't want to upset what seems to the status quo and rules of the home like changing thermostats etc, probably out of embarrassment for moving back with parents and not wanting to upset you so they got that in to improve their temporary lodgings.\nLastly, Instead of asking them to take it out, ask why they felt the need to bring it in and to come to you to discuss household issues in future and if they are having problems with the agreed payments, ask to go through it with them again, discuss their ingoings and outgoings so you have agreement that is reasonable for both parties and gets them in a position where they are able to move out. The reason you here in this position is because you wanted to help them out.", "NTA. \n\nIn my experience, those window units are usually huge power sponges.

You could have them pay for the increase in utilities alongside their rent payment to you. It sounds like your family has some issues it needs to workout around your daughter being a adult but not granted the same respect you would someone else over the age of 21. Your daughter also needs to come to terms that she is an adult and needs to pay you and your husband for staying at the house. \n\nTry sitting down and taking everything out.

They should not have put a window ac in without discussing it with you first. You need to have a discussion with them, about the rent and the ac, before removing it. 71 is not very cool for sleeping and just because the thermostat is set to 71 doesn't mean that's the temperature throughout the house.

They are still at an age that they can be young and dumb about a lot of things or caught up in their own problems.   Maybe they don't realise how much those things cost to run compared to the house AC.  Maybe they thought they were being helpful by not complaining if they were too hot.    Maybe they assumed you'd take rent in arrears as it was family and you were helping them get back on their feet.\n\nTalk to them.  Get on the same page.

It's your home and so far SD hasn't contributed at all financially. When she starts paying bills she can make decisions about installing and running expensive appliances.

You don't need to adjust your ac colder or have it looked at or anything else. For 300$ a month they can deal with it or get out. Especially since they haven't paid you yet. I would add a clause to their \"agreement\" now that says if they are late 3 times in rent payment, they have to go. There are two of them.

Taking on 2 adults into a household changes water, gas, and electric bills the minute they move in. I do not find 71 too hot to sleep in. If they don\u2019t like the temperature in YOUR house they can find someplace else to live. Coming into your home and expecting to run up excess electricity is disrespectful. A fan is one thing, they can get one those. A room AC is expensive to run. You and your husband need to get on the same page on what you expect from your adult daughter and boyfriend living with you.

There's no need for you to get involved or defend him. He's grown.\n\nAs for the window unit, if they're paying rent, contributing to groceries, and/or paying utilities, there's no reason they shouldn't have a say in their accommodations. You can easily explain the potential extra electric cost and come to a compromise, like only running it part of the day.

I\u2019m very thankful for how my parents raised me in this regard.\n\nThere is absolutely NO reason why these two can\u2019t take on housework, and that absolutely needs to be a hard line in the sand.\n\nThe good news about this AC unit is that it actually gives you leverage. You can\u2019t ground them, but you can remove that unit.\n\nSo my advice is to set the rules with very clear expectations about housework contributions, rent contributions, and lifestyle expectations (ex. No drugs, have to hold down a job, etc\u2026 whatever works for you).\n\nWhen they don\u2019t follow the rules? See ya later AC, until they get in line. Acting up in the winter?

We wanted them to learn to research companies and make a choice, learn about finances, and have peer support for becoming an adult (since we both realize it's very different for them now than when we were their age). None of that happened for quite a while. They still paid rent... Sometimes (when they had a job). \n\nI feel like we've only recently started to be able to do things effectively. And try to point them in the right direction, it feels like they're starting to do better.\n\nWe sat down and re-visited the other requirements with rent. We thought of a bunch of things we could do in a few categories. Finances, transportation, and researching things. We gave them all the things we thought of sand let them sit on that a week and choose what they would be most interested in. We settled on a budget meeting a month, scheduled within the first week of the month. They have chosen not to drive, so we have worked to get them comfortable with taking the bus to and from work, they are confident with that now and once the summer passes we'll work on going new places. And every month they do a report on something of their choice, but that has to be approved by us, and they're fairly open to suggestions. So far they've done bike maintenance (since they primarily ride a bike), aquarium setup and care for one they think would be manageable for them, and what they should know going into petsitting (because they watch their mom's animals sometimes).\n\nI think the largest turning point has been getting them into therapy and asking about it. But also having non-financial consequences. We also outlined this when we chose our new extra activities. We generally let them be an adult and have over whoever, whenever, so long as they're not being loud. But one month we had to instate that they had to check with us before anyone came over, because they forgot to schedule the budget meeting. We still did the meeting, but because they forgot to initiate the scheduling, we had to have consequences. We've also said we would put the parental controls on the Internet and turn it off from 11pm-8am, nothing crazy for their schedule, but would cut them off from the Internet earlier than usual. Not really meant to be diminutive, just inconvenient. \n\nWe have tried a lot of strategies though, some have worked for them, some haven't.
