She wants a pet monkey so bad, so she keeps trying to find one for sale on Facebook. Of course, she\u2019s been scammed like 20 times since Christmas. Our entire family and I have all told her she isn\u2019t going to find a legitimate monkey breeder on Facebook who is willing to accept $300 for a baby monkey.

She didn\u2019t ever outright ask for money, but I told her I felt awful and would buy her a monkey if I could afford it but right now wasn\u2019t a great time as we just had to pay our federal taxes. \nLater, I get this message from her saying she\u2019s so so sorry for being selfish and asking for money. How she\u2019s never asked anyone for a dime, and it\u2019s hurts so bad that she can\u2019t even borrow $200 from me.\nI told her I didn\u2019t remember her asking for money but apologized if I made her feel weird by telling her I\u2019d buy it for her if I could. No response. \nMoments later, I get messages from my brother and little sister at the same time pretty much describing exactly what I just went through with her. Little sister feels awful and offered to buy her one from a reputable breeder in Florida. Brother is beyond pissed as he just had to shell out all kinds of money after a car accident, so he\u2019s annoyed she is so upset over a monkey. \n\nTL;DR: My elderly mother wants a monkey, but my siblings and I just don\u2019t want her to keep getting scammed.
