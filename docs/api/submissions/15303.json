She didn\u2019t ever outright ask for money, but I told her I felt awful and would buy her a monkey if I could afford it but right now wasn\u2019t a great time as we just had to pay our federal taxes. \nLater, I get this message from her saying she\u2019s so so sorry for being selfish and asking for money. How she\u2019s never asked anyone for a dime, and it\u2019s hurts so bad that she can\u2019t even borrow $200 from me.\nI told her I didn\u2019t remember her asking for money but apologized if I made her feel weird by telling her I\u2019d buy it for her if I could.
