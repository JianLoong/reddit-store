His mother gifted us the limo's, my mom paid for my wedding dress and shoes. We split costs with the bridal party. My grandfather gave us money for hotel for  honeymoon and his parents gifted us the airfare and let us stay in their house abroad that was empty to save on hotels.

For example, a lot of men would never have considered that you\u2019d want multiple dresses for different events that cost in the hundreds.\n\nAlso, if a family or husband just financially are unable to pay a certain amount, you really can\u2019t hold that against them or make them feel ashamed about it. This can be a difficult one, because out of pride some parents can give \u201csmokescreens\u201d so that it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a financial issue, and can get angry instead and lash out in other ways.\n\nI would say, rather than is anyone being \u201can asshole\u201d or not\u2026 it\u2019s more productive to approach this like you would as any married couple should approach financial issues (it\u2019s gonna happen).

THAT is unfair, and he really should put his foot down. What are you bringing to the table? Why don't you pay for your own wedding dress?", "INFO, is there a cultural difference between your families? \n\nI'm saying this because in traditional Canadian/ western weddings, it's the brides family that is supposed to pay (historically).\n\nAlso, did you sit down with both sets of parents at one time and discuss the budget? Do his parents know what your family is expecting from this wedding? And how elaborate it is going to be? \n\nHave you talked to his parents about shopping / paying for things as they come up?
