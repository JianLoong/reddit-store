I unintentionally got a foreign exchange student kicked out of my university and the country", "selftext": "My freshman year of college I was taking Chemistry 101. This course required a lab once a week that was three hours long. We were given a packet at the beginning of the semester that had every lab and it would be turned in all together at the end. This was our only packet so if we lost it, we lost our entire semester's worth of work. The lab section was worth 40% of our grade. So essentially if you didn't turn in the packet, the most you could get was a 60, meaning you fail the class.\n\nWe were each given a lab partner at random. We would work together, but would fill out our own packets. They made it clear that they would not count your partner's work as your own, meaning that if you had missing or blank pages you were out of luck. My lab partner was a foreign exchange student from Kuwait. Our lab instructor was also from there, so I believe this was intentional to help with the language barrier.\n\nMy lab partner would show up super late every week. Even when he was there, he was either so confused by the material and gave up, or he would choose to spend his time socializing with his friends. By the end of the semester, he had done maybe 5% of the work and would just copy mine to breeze through the class. When he would help with the labs, he would make so many mistakes causing me to have to start over multiple times, making me stay late to fix them. He was also just blatantly rude to me all semester.\n\nThe final straw however came during the last lab we had of the semester when he broke a beaker. My partner immediately started speaking to the lab TA in their shared language. I quickly realized he was blaming me in his language so I couldn\u2019t refute it. I was fuming. This kid was already getting over 50 hours of my work that he had no help in, but now I was being forced to clean his mess. I also had to pay to replace the broken beaker, because the lab TA was insistent on believing his story.\n\nIt was time to turn in our packets and I was busy cleaning up (which he also never helped with), so he turned his packet first. I was one of the last to turn in. In the heat of the moment I dropped my packet on top of the pile, grabbed his packet and threw it in a trash can far away.\n\nI ran into his best friend from the class a couple of semesters later. He told me that he got kicked out of school, because their sponsors who were funding them studying abroad, had a zero tolerance policy for failing classes. He had failed chemistry due to failing the lab section.\n\nI did not admit to it then but I felt super guilty.\n\nOn one hand I feel as though he was an asshole and deserved what he got. On the other hand I feel like I am in the wrong because I forced karma's hand. But also I did not mean for him to have to leave the country, I just wanted to make his ability to pass the class more difficult, I really thought he would figure something out and still pass. I just graduated this week and he obviously did not get the chance to do so. Does this make me an asshole?\n\n(Edit to clarify some points)\n\nI contacted the professor multiple times throughout the semester. I never heard back from her.\n\nI told the TA multiple times face to face about the frustrations. He told me in various ways that I was making things up and trying to cause issues.\n\nOriginally I was not letting him copy my work after class, but if I didn't he would just stay after class and the TA would let him. Eventually I gave up and just let him do it.\n\nWhile yes it would have been nice to document proof, there really was no proof to document. We were supposed to have similar answers as we were supposed t be doing the work together.\n\nMy main focus was on making sure I passed the class as chemistry is a topic in school that I really struggle with. A lot of my frustration came from the fact that everyone had a partner that they could use for help and I essentially was partner less. He would also on multiple occasions tease me for the fact that he had a higher grade in the class than me.\n\nThis was the first semester back after covid, so getting in person meetings was very difficult. Also tests at that point were online because of that.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1683450416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ai9lu/aita_i_unintentionally_got_a_foreign_exchange/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had so many opportunities to deal with him in a way that was non-AH.", "The action was bad but honestly? Cheaters have no place in college. You\u2019ll end up a failure if you do.

Cheating at a university impacts all students as the quality of those that graduate goes down, and so does the reputation of a school. \n\nAs far as I can see, you did the right thing. The guy was taking advantage of being from the same country as that of the TA. You worked hard and deserved the credit. \n\nNTA", "Eh.

I get your frustration, he was an ass. But here you just needed to let it go and ignore it as you were judged on your own work. You had nothing to worry about, your own grade was safe and karma would've gotten him sooner or later in life. But you deliberately sabotaged any chances he had to make a life here, you set him up for failure, and that is so much worse.", "NTA\nHe copied it all from you. So you threw your own extra notes. You didn't know he'd get kicked out. Just be happy. You're just petty, not an AH.\n\nI don't care what others think. If you had known he'd get kicked out and had still done it, then maaayyybe you'd be the AH. If he wanted to pass, then he should've been grateful that you were letting him copy off of your lab work. Instead, guy had the fucking audacity to break a beaker and blame it on you? By using his leverage of similar ethnicity? Yeah what a bs move.\n\nNTA, don't listen to anyone else. If it makes you feel so guilty, don't do it again. But don't cry over rightfully spilt milk. Chill.", "Going against the grain. NTA.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you didn\u2019t do this. What then logically happens? Maybe you both then pass the class. Or\u2026.. Maybe the professor then grades both of your packets and confronts each of you about having identical work and you both get failed. \n\nThe exchange student\u2019s behavior is unacceptable and it sounds like you put up with months of it before everything finally came to a head with the beaker incident. I recently graduated college (last May), so I know just how frustrating partner/group work is for large university assignments when you are stuck with lazy people. That feeling is still fresh with me. I get it OP.\n\nI will agree with the YTA comments saying there were obviously better ways to go about this. And I will caution you that you should not act this way. But it happened, and it\u2019s in the past. Live and learn, and move on.\n\nStill, NTA. \n\nHe made his bed, he can lie in it. People like him think it\u2019s their world and everyone else is just a side character in their protagonist arc. You can\u2019t treat people like garbage and expect them to just accept it. He got what was coming to him.", "NTA to be honest, you didn\u2019t think it would get him kicked out of university. He deserved failing that class. What an entitled AH. \n\nMom and dad will for sure buy him into another American university soon, so it was great he got a taste of his own medicine for once.", "ESH. Sure he was an ass but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you took and threw away education documents that were simply not yours.", "If you couldn\u2019t get in touch with the professor, you should have contacted the dean. Not being able to reach the professor is its own problem.", "Yes he was an A H. But you were not to be his judge nor the executioner of the sentence. \n\nYou knew he was a foreign exchange student, so obviously him being there came with certain criteria he had to meet.\n\nHis attitude towards work might have gotten him send away anyway, but that would have been HIS lack of merit, not you sabotaging his work, 'cause that's basically what you did. You sabotaged him. And being a foreign exchange student, it got him kicked out, which was to be expected.\n\nYTA", "ESH.  He was definitely a huge prick but you went too far and I think you know that.", "YTA. Impossible for you to ever make this up to him again. Hope the cash value of a new beaker was worth the scars on your soul", "NTA.  As far as I'm concerned, that packet was yours anyway if it was all copied from you work.  You should also report the lab instructor to his supervisor for allowing those under his supervision to flout academic standards.\n\nedit lap -> lab", "YTA.\n\nNo level of \"But look what he did!\" ever justifies you doing the same or worse.", "I would say NTA yes you shouldn\u2019t have thrown his stuff away, but at the end of the day it\u2019s not like he actually done any of the work, and moreover he was an asshole to you. He would have passed chemistry without knowing anything about it.", "YTA You didn\u2019t \u2018force karma\u2019s hand.\u2019 You sabotaged him. \n\nIs he an AH? Yes. But you dropped down to his level and then some. \n\nYou could have just reported him for constantly being late. You could have not let him copy you. You could have gone above the TA\u2019s head about the beaker thing. You could have requested a new partner. \n\nYou had multiple ways to handle this correctly, and you chose none of them.", "YTA wtf. how could you not be an asshole?", "Absolutely NTA", "He sounds annoying as hell. But you have probably known since you were very young that two wrongs don't make a right. What you did was really bad, OP and you absolutely intended to cost him the class because you said you knew upfront how critical the pack was. You could have refused to let him copy, surely? Made a formal complaint? You were in the right (in a doormat-ish kind of way) until you took his pack. That action makes your version of events seem unreliable. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou did this because you felt personally wronged.  If this was about academic integrity or ethics, you would have reported him.  You showed yourself as having poor ethics and coping skills.  \n\nHe won\u2019t think he did anything wrong because he won\u2019t have a reason for this happening to him.  He will just blame whatever.\n\nYou will run across this type of person your entire life.  You have to learn to deal with it in an appropriate manner.", "YTA. Who do you think you are that *you* get to decide what he deserves, especially when you claim that you didn\u2019t even know the stakes? I hope you used a throwaway account, because what you did likely could, and should, get you kicked out of the university too. Did you, at any point, try using your big boy words and talk to him about any of these issues?", "Wow, I never knew you could unintentionally grap someone else's thing and throw it into the trash. I'm learning new things every day.", "YTA.\n\nThe correct thing would have been to turn him in for plagiarism. Same result.", "NTA he stole YOUR work and wanted to submit it, and as you said you tried contacting the professor and the lab TA about his behavior and they did nothing. He got what was coming to him", "This is totally made up. Not passing Chem 101 in their freshman year, even if they failed every other class they wouldn\u2019t be kicked out.", "Very soft YTA. In the end your frustration got the better of you and you kind of ruined the guy\u2019s opportunity at a better future. I don\u2019t know if you keep up with the state of our country but getting here is SUPER hard if not for education. I know he was a dick and do not condone any of his actions whatsoever, but I think deep down you know you were wrong for that", "ESH\n\nIve had several students like him as partners for class before. Never made them fail a class as a consequence for being a bit of a shit.", "ESH, look man I get that he was being a dick, but destroying his work wasn't really right, letting him fail on his own by not letting him copy you, or writing intentionally wrong information in your reports and changing them after he copies you would have been a fair cop.\n\nBut going and straight up destroying his work was a bit far.\n\nAlso what uni has 60% as a failing grade?", "yta. i understand why you did it but still. in this case i would've tried to gather evidence and tell the school about him instead. ofc it would have been better to stand up to him when this started or ask for a new parter but its too late now", "YTA. It\u2019s not like you stopped letting him copy your work. you threw out his packet.", "Obviously YTA", "Karmas a bitch. He had it coming. NTA", "Yes, you're a huge arsehole.\n\nYour work wasn't being marked together, you had absolutely no reason to do what you did other than spite. It wasn't karma, it was you being a child.\n\nYTA", "This would be better in the pro revenge sub", "YTA.  And you have a very bad temper.", "YTA if the reason he failed was because his lab packet wasn\u2019t on the pile and was never found. It sounds like his attitude to learning would have made him fail at some point anyway, you didn\u2019t need to do what you did. You\u2019re going to have to live with that guilt for the rest of your life so do you still think \u201che deserved what he got\u201d was worth it?", "YTA. You seem to describe an asshole the whole time and then make that pale into insignificance with your own assholery.", "YTA", "ESH but leaning more on the NTA side. throwing away his paper was a dick move, but he got what he deserved. if he cared that much about his education he would've equally shared the workload instead of copying 95% of it from you. however, there would've been other actions you could've taken to deal with the issue that would solve the problem whilst also allowing him to keep studying.\n\nultimately though, cheating would probably come back to bite him in the ass anyway regardless of the actions you took.", "YTA but frankly? Being an asshole is better than being a doormat sometimes. Honestly, depending on your cpurse of study you did the world a favour by preventing him to reach a position where his incompetence could have hurt someone.\n\nUltimately people shouldn't expect to have shit repaid with gold.", "From your comments the TA covered for him out of blatant favouritism when you tried to do the right thing and report the issue while it was happening.

Then he would\u2019ve had to go back anyways. I find it really hard to believe that you\u2019re not old enough to realize the consequences this would have.", "Actions have consequences. Hopefully you learn from this and treat people better in future", "Fair.", "Oh no, you're facing the CONSEQUENCES of your ACTIONS and you're feeling guilty. \n\nGrow up.", "I mean, the majority of students I went to uni with had some sort of aid that was dependent on GPA so failing a class would have majorly bad outcomes. Hopefully you've learned the lesson of dealing with conflict the right way instead of the AH way.", "I just can\u2019t imagine having  my actions be the reason someone fails the class. I would have told the TA or prof or lab instructor about my issues sooner. let their own actions fail them.", "He deserved what he got and was coddled all his life by being enabled to cheat.", "Um, no...\n\n>>.... They made it clear that they would not count your partner's work as your own...\n\n>>.... My lab partner would show up super late every week. Even when he was there, he was either so confused by the material and gave up, or he would choose to spend his time socializing with his friends. By the end of the semester, he had done maybe 5% of the work and would just copy mine to breeze through the class. When he would help with the labs, he would make so many mistakes causing me to have to start over multiple times, making me stay late to fix them. ...\n\nHe would have had to have actually participated in doing the lab work to have the right to use the results. Just saying.", "I agree with your stance that cheaters do / can impact the outcome for others, but the right way would have been to not let lab partner cheat off OP's work, or complain to the department if OP couldn't prevent the copying, not to hurl the packet in the trash after the fact.", ">If everyone takes on that attitude, the value of education goes down for that university along with its reputation. Employers will wind up with subpar employees from said university and build a bias from their interaction with those who cheated through.\n\nThis is incorrect. This is a naive fantasy of how education and employment works.", "I disagree. He was blatantly taking advantage of you and did not do the work that would require him to pass. You didn't handle it the right way and you should not have thrown his packet out. IMO the correct way to go about this would have been to document everything and make an informed complaint to the university about plagiarism and cheating. Letting it go does nothing but encourage him to do worse the next time. Scholarships are for the deserving.", "No, you shouldn't have. If his work looked like yours, then he could have claimed you plagiarized his work, and you'd be the one being kicked out and accused of cheating.", "You had other options \u2014 including speaking to the professor or the dean. You choose a dishonourable route", "What outcome were you hoping for? That he would just have to retake the class? What stops him from copying off his next lab partner?", "OK I see where you're coming from with that, but it was still a childish, spiteful and vindictive thing to do.", "What is this comment in reference too?", "how is it that you're being so aggressive against OP when siding with the cheater, the person who has deservedly faced the consequences of their own actions?", "I did tell them\u2026 to no avail", "OP says in edits the TA would let the other study copy OP\u2019s packet", "OP has commented that he wrote to the professor, and the TA and the TA took a liking to the cheater. Nothing was being done. I still say he did the right thing to stop the cheating. OP was pushed against the wall to take action.", ">including speaking to the professor or the dean\n\nWho do you think they'd have believed? Random student or the TA?", "You", "honestly, I would include this in your post, that you did attempt to tell the people in charge. in general I think it would garner greater sympathy for you. \npersonally I still think YTA, but I really do understand your frustration and i\u2019m sorry.", "Possibly security cameras, if not in the room, then outside the building, which can show times of entry/exit for the labs. There were other options, and OP picked a dishonourable one", "I had to cut a lot out for character count\nThere was so much more I would have liked to include but I wanted to make sure I got the main stuff in there", "OP is very, very lucky they weren't caught on camera doing this. They'd be out on their ear and rightly so.", "once you\u2019ve posted it, you can edit it and add more characters beyond the initial character count limit! fun fact", "I appreciate it", "Pretty sure thats bad advice. Mods don't tend to like it when you try to get around their rules."]}
