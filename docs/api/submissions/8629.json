A lot. I thought that once he apologized and I forgave him that would be the end of it all. For years he knew I wanted a child and he was adamant about never having kids but then he agreed to have a baby which, now I know after he\u2019s brought it to my attention, was meant to be a bandaid on our relationship. Our child is now a toddler and a year ago my husband came to me admitting he had gotten another woman pregnant. That night messed me up and I remember through all the tears, pleading and begging to never hurt me again and all that, and my insides just broke. I decided to pull my big girl pants on and gave him an ultimatum because he insisted he still wanted to be with me and not break up our family;either he respects me and set appropriate boundaries, or leave us. Since then every boundary we\u2019ve set he\u2019s broken it. I told him I didn\u2019t want him going over to the other woman\u2019s house for anything, yet I found out he was over quite often for what he claimed were baby related things. He\u2019s gone to the baby shower, was there for the birth, and has spent nights over there and blames me because I won\u2019t allow the kid over my house our our kid over there. We had gone to therapy for a while and the therapist made it seem like I was the monster for not wanting this other kid around my family, but didn\u2019t once mention to my husband that cheating is wrong. Now my husband wants me to \u201cwork with him\u201d and help make things easier on him because he\u2019s so tired going from one house to the other everyday. I told him I wasn\u2019t the one who fucked up, so why should I make things easier on him? He never learned any other other times I forgave him, only used it as a pass to keep up the same old behavior. I am in the process of saving up my own money to get a place for me and my son because I plan to divorce him, but it\u2019s going to take a while. He doesn\u2019t think spending the night at another woman\u2019s house is a problem, nor does he seem to care about whether or not I ever trust him again, and all the while he\u2019s calling me selfish and a monster for not wanting to give his illegitimate son a great childhood. He\u2019s worried about this other woman putting him on child support and in the process has ruined our marriage. Now he\u2019s turning it around on me saying if I cared about his kid or his situation we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.

Your husband and that woman are gross. That baby, however, is not. It\u2019s pretty unethical to deprive an infant of a relationship with their deadbeat dad. Your husband sounds like a consummate asshole. If he\u2019s ever going to change he\u2019s probably gonna need to experience some real consequences. Cut your losses and don\u2019t make the affair babies\u2019 life any harder than it already is. EHS", "NTA. If he cared about you he wouldn\u2019t have put you in this position time and time again. Sometimes love isn\u2019t enough.", "Lol good grief girl", "What did I just read?\n\nYeah, of course NTA, but also *why did it take this long to leave?*", "Nta but girl get out, go to family or a shelter if necessary but get away from that situation asap", "Get a divorce. Y T A to yourself for staying with this man for so long", "NTA. He cannot seriously expect you to care for a child the he had with another woman while married to you. He is bearing the consequences of his choices. He doesn\u2019t have to like any of it. That\u2019s not your problem.", "YTA\n\nTo yourself. Over and over and over again.\n\nHe cheated. You kept him. AH to yourself.\n\nYou coerced him to have a baby, even though he didn't want one and it was just a bandaid for the relationship. AH to yourself, him and the child you brought into the world.\n\nYou set boundaries. The were stomped. Yet you are still with him. Again an AH to yourself.\n\nThe situation you are in is entirely of your own making.\n\nDivorce this man, and let him be a father to both his children.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting his affair baby in your life, but you shouldn't be stopping him from being in its life.", "INFO: Could you clarify the ultimatum?", "NTA. The time to talk to a lawyer is long overdue. Take full custody of your kid, take what else you can, and dump this AH.", "NTA.\n\nNobody should fault you for being upset your husband is a complete idiot who only cares about himself.\n\n>Now he\u2019s turning it around on me saying if I cared about his kid or his situation we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. \n\nYour husband has no concept of responsibility or how his actions have consequences. HE put you both in this situation. HE broke thr boundaries HE agreed to in the first place.\n\nThis guy wants to have his cake and eat it too. Let him be a father, but do not let this man disrespect you like this or try to gaslight you for HIS mistakes. \n\nLeave, divorce him and never look back.\n\nAnd the bit about child support being his reasoning for why... This guy might legit not care about his other kid and just wants to not have to pay up. Trying to dodge accountability yet again if this is the case, but I don't know him enough to say for sure.\n\nI feel bad for the kid, this guy's probably going to mess up somewhere if he can't even take responsibility for his own actions.", "ESH\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to divorce him why set all these rules and ultimatums? \n\nSeparate, you coparent - acknowledge his new baby is your son\u2019s half sibling sooner rather than later. The therapist isn\u2019t ignoring he cheated, it\u2019s just irrelevant with respect to the two kids.\n\nDivorce sounds like a good idea, I\u2019d focus on exiting healthily in therapy and setting up co-parenting. Stop pretending you\u2019re waiting for him to change, you know better.\n\nBtw, I dated a guy like your son. His mom successfully got her husband (his dad) to cut off his other child. After hearing the entire story and how little empathy this guy had for his sister (he sided with his mom and thinks like her- no empathy)\u2026I couldn\u2019t be with him. Just no empathy at all, very entitled. I couldn\u2019t get past that. He couldn\u2019t understand why at all, that\u2019s how little he got it. It\u2019s not attractive or nice person you raise with this mentality ime.", "ESH:  he's a cheater so yea he's an AH. \n\nBut you instead of leaving him, tried making him have nothing to do with his child. By saying you dont want him going over there and the child can't come over is effectively saying for him to not be a father.  \n\nWhy would you want a child to be fatherless?", "Now you know why you should never forgive a cheater. ALWAYS dump them. Your husband is an awful person. Please get rid of him as soon as possible. You have no obligation to accept or even acknowledge his affair child. Big NTA!", "so first if you are going to divorce him I would do so asap to get your child support order in as in some cases I have heard of that makes a difference in the amount.  IANAL\n\nBUT you are going to need to understand that once you do divorce or separate your child will be around the half sibling and his mother and there is not anything you will be able to do about that unless she has some kind of criminal record or someting.   He will probably move in with her and during his custody time will have your child at her house.  You need to talk to a lawyer about the laws in your state and come up with a plan.", "NTA but his son isn't illegitimate. It's a poor word for an innocent human being..", "NTA. He\u2019s blaming you for his mistakes. Stick to your ultimatum. Save up and get out. Leave as soon as you can, go stay with a relative or kick him out.", "NTA.\n\nI would have called you an asshole and said just leave his cheating ass already, but since you are in the process of saving up to file for divorce, I will take that back.\n\nBut may I recommend separation. Some states/countries require you to live separately anyway for x amount of time, maybe start the separation process as you save up for divorce.", "NTA \n\nI would have nothing to do with the kid or the husband. I hope you know that this isn't your fault. Keep yourself safe. I would let husband do whatever he wanted, just not bring the other son around your home.", "ESH there are children involved! You either forgive your husband and accept everything and understand that he's probably going to cheat on you time and time again you could possibly end up raising several more affair babies, or you GTFO. Take your kid and stop screwing around with this guy!", "NTA. But keep in mind he will likely get partial custody of your kid together. So some weekends or whatever your child will be staying with him. And he will likely have his two kids together. When your child is with you you'll have to hear all about their little sibling. It's also possible he could end up living with or marrying the woman he had an affair with. So she may end up as your child's step mother.", "NTA\nIm sorry to say this but you should have left him by the first time. Once a cheater always a cheater. Take his ass to court and divorce him and dont forget the child support.\nYou deserve better.", "Oh wow, this is such a horrible situation for you. I don't blame you for not wasting a relationship with the child. I wouldn't either. BUT, I also wouldn't want a relationship with your husband either. He sounds like an AH. There is no way he is \"just doing baby things\". He has no respect for you or your family. I hope you get a new therapist,  coz they seem like an idiot and get your things sorted so you can move on with your life. Get that CS and get a good lawyer! Good luck to you!", "NTA\n\nDivorce him and do not let him make you feel guilty, he's created his own problems.", "NTA and why would he expect you to care about a child he had from his ongoing affair. He sounds like a miserable excuse for a human being and you need to divorce him and take everything you can away from him.", "NTA, divorce like yesterday.", "NTA okay first of all why did you stay with him if he cheated so many times!  A leopard never changes its spot. Also not your child not your responsibility. Girl sit down with yourself and ask yourself \"Is he all worth it?\" \"Can I 100% believe he won't cheat again?\" If for any second there is any doubt just walk away. Guy sounds like the AH\n\n*edit* - spelling mistake", "NTA You have very right to be angry at your husband. Divorce him. Then consider. The other child is your son's half brother. Did this woman even know he was.married? Take time before a decision because none of this is the other boys fault.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you have a plan to leave.", "You\u2019ve got to love yourself more.  How can you be a good example to your child, when you allow yourself to be treated like this?  Get that cash saved up sooner rather then later, and get out. \nNTA", "NTA it sounds like you recognize this marriage is over. Affair baby would be a hard limit for me. It sounds like he\u2019s still in a relationship with the other woman. Get your ducks in a row to get away from this man. He created this situation, so he can fix it. It\u2019s only a matter of time until he ends up with a second kid with her.", "NTA divorce him and calm child support", "NTA for not wanting to deal with his kid, but you've let him walk all over you. You need to get out of that situation for your own mental health", "ESH, except for the kids. What difference does it make at this point? You two are not married in any sense other than legally. You seem to be expecting behavior from him that is never going to happen so why keep trying to change anything other than getting yourself and your son out of there? Talk to a divorce lawyer about what money you can legally take from your married time and leave. Otherwise it seems like you are still trying to hold on to something that was broken from the beginning.", "OP isn\u2019t less of a victim because she tried to keep her child\u2019s family together.", "This is the way! \n\nKick him out OP, he can stay with his AP", "Pfft he's staying the night at the other woman's house. They're definitely still boning.", "I agree! I have heard that the first person to make a child support claim gets the best consideration from the court. Get what\u2019s legally owed your child ASAP. NTA", "It says in the post she\u2019s saving up to move out and divorce him", "And why are you running down his other kid.", "> YTA to yourself.\n\nAbsolutely agree.... Time and time OP used her rubber spine. Then don't go crying...\n\n>decided to pull my big girl pants on\n\nThis was a lie..", "Why would she give him credit?  Him going to see his child is breaking her \"boundaries.\"   Seems OP would prefer if he never seen the child", "She says she's planning to divorce and is saving up $$ to move out but can't do so as yet.", "She is saving up for divorce. She doesn\u2019t want this circus in her life or her child\u2019s life. I don\u2019t think she is an asshole for not having the funds sooner to finish the process.", "But she isn\u2019t stopping him? She just wants nothing to do with the affair child and won\u2019t allow the child in her own home. Which ya I get.", "Dude, how many assholes do you have in that comment? I lost count. Was this a trigger?", "OP calling the kid his \u201cillegitimate child\u201d is giving me major ick. Of course he is a huge AH, but it\u2019s hard for me to feel sympathy for OP with the way she speaks about the other child and the fact that she brought their own child into this fucked up relationship.", "She is saving up to file for divorce. I think she is already one step ahead.", "Yes. Cheating is not enough for a judge to not grant joint custody. If he\u2019s a good dad, he will get joint. Judges look at what is best for the CHILD, not what is most comforting to the parents\u2019 feelings. During his parenting time, he can absolutely include his other child. There\u2019s no point in trying to hate the other child in this situation. It will only make both kids grow up to resent OP.", "Women will go to extraordinary lengths to make sure their child doesn't spend 50 percent of their time with alone with their father. Even if it means staying in a miserable marriage", "Let\u2019s be real, once a man cheats on you REPEATEDLY there is no family to keep together, just an illusion of one. And yes she\u2019s less of a victim because she can choose to get out, the other child cannot.", "You mean the family she created with him after she already knew he was a cheater and a liar? That\u2019s no family. That\u2019s just coping and hoping with a baby as an attempted bandaid.", "Can't POSSIBLY be taking care of his child \ud83e\udd23", "After how long? Can she really go through with it?", "And that would be unfair to the child to never see her dad. She can't take it on a child.", "It's safe to bet this \"planning\" has been going on for quite some time. Like since the first time he cheated", "OP has no obligation to that child. As long as she doesn't keep her husband away. But if he thinks the baby mama isn't going to come after him for child support eventually (as she well should), I have some swampland to sell him", "Why not both? I never said he wasn't spending time with the affair child, but there is no reason for him to stay the night. \nYou're seriously telling me you don't think they're boning?", "She said she's saving up.  I completely understand not being able to leave immediately unless she has somewhere to go.", "Unclear how old the affair baby is, but given how low libido is after giving birth (for most women this lasts around a year or more) I doubt that's why", "I'm seriously saying that the mother of his other child needs sleep to be a safe parent. Not knowing her complete situation, part of his job AS A PARENT is to make sure she gets enough sleep to be a safe parent too."]}
