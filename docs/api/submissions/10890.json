Your family, including their weird hobby, is part of what made you who you are today.\n\nBut you\u2019ve been for 5 years, you don\u2019t like it, and you\u2019re basically an adult.

That\u2019s absolutely the right move.\n\nIs it prudish? By your family\u2019s definition, sure, but that\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. We all have our own limits when it comes to our comfort with our bodies and the bodies of other people and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t like being naked around anyone but my husband and child. I don\u2019t even like being seen fully clothed without a bra by other people.", "NTA.

This part I'm used to, since it's always been this way. The thing is that for about a decade now, we take an annual vacation for a week up to this nudist resort. The place is pretty huge, and it has a ton of activities.\n\nThe thing is that I don't really consider myself a naturist, it just doesn't appeal to me. My sister (20f) is the opposite, she almost never wears anything at home, which is fine. By the time I was a teen I wasn't comfortable being nude around anybody anymore, or really even being around other people who were. My parents still made me go, because clothing was optional for everywhere at the resort accept the pools and a couple outdoor spaces. The issue is the would always get pissed at me for nlt swimming, and I'd end up having to at some point.\n\nI explained to everyone that I haven't felt comfortable at or enjoyed these trips in five years, and I'm not going to do them anymore. My parents tried to argue, but they really can't make me do anything so that went nowhere. My sister later came to me and said I was being a prude, and that this isn't how we were raised. She thinks I should just suck it up and go for our parents sake, and maybe she's right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a social nudist, I LOVE going to family friendly resorts but...that is my choice. \n\nYou shouldn't have to do something you are uncomfortable with. \n\nAs others have suggested, book a vacation with friends and enjoy your week.", "NTA\n\n\nNudity is not everyone's choice.\n\n\n>My parents still made me go\n\nThat sounds like sexually coercing a minor to me.

How is this not child abuse???", "As someone who enjoys casual nudity around friends, you are absolutely NTA for having boundaries surrounding your own body. You get to decide who sees you nude, no one else.", "NTA and why do they think it\u2019s okay to force their ways on you but you shouldn\u2019t force your ways on them?

Believe me. You don't even really notice the nudity after 20 minutes. Nudity of itself isn't sexual and the the vision of social nudism has nothing to do with sex. It's about freedom from the social constraints that are brought about by clothing, returning to a natural state and the health benefits of fresh air, sunshine, exercise and socialization. \n\nEveryone who visits the resorts undergoes a strict background check. You are given stickers to cover your cell phone cameras. There is zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior or comments, staring, taking photos without permission etc. You are out on your naked rear end without a warning. Single men typically are not allowed to visit unless they are part of a group or are a member.

You don't consider forcing a minor to be nude around strangers might have some sexual element?  I mean, I do understand the whole \"Back to nature\" angle, and how nudity on  beaches and in saunas Is not sexual,  but even so....", "You\u2019re Goddamn right!", "Pardon me, his rights.", "Not necessarily.
