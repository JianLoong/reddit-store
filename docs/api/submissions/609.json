My mom was so excited about our wedding, but she passed away pretty suddenly less than a year into our engagement. It has been and is still really hard on me.\n\nMy mom struggled with her mental and physical health, and after spending several years neglecting my own health to help her with no success, I had to set a boundary in order to support both of us without destroying my own health. I still checked on my mom every day to make sure she was okay while also keeping some physical distance. It wasn\u2019t perfect and I still feel guilty that there wasn\u2019t more I could have done for my mom, and at the same time I had to learn to accept that I couldn\u2019t fix her problems.\n\nMy mom had 4 siblings, all of whom are still living. We\u2019ll call them Jack, Vinny, Kristin, and Angela. Angela knew what happened with my mom, but she would try to guilt me into crossing my own boundaries for my mom. She told me I was a bad daughter for not driving over an hour to check on my mom, even though she lived 5 minutes away and could have checked herself. Another time, I was living in a different state than my mom and Angela insisted I spend $500 (that I couldn\u2019t afford) on a plane ticket to go home and fix something in my mom\u2019s life I had no control over. That argument got so bad I had to go to the hospital.\n\nWhen my mom died, my mama (who was divorced from my mom) helped me plan the funeral, paid for everything because I had no money and my mom\u2019s siblings didn\u2019t help pay, took time off work to attend the funeral, and held my mom\u2019s hand as she passed away (three of my mom\u2019s four siblings stayed with my grandmother to make sure she was okay, which I understand, but also didn\u2019t bother to say goodbye to their sister). When we were at the funeral, my mama offered a handshake to Jack, and Jack wouldn\u2019t shake her hand. After the funeral, when we went to visit my grandmother, Kristin, Jack, and Angela had planned a post-funeral party at her house\u2026 without telling me. The whole family knew except me, including extended family that had come from out of town for the funeral.\n\nAfter everything that happened with Angela, Kristin, and Jack, I decided I didn\u2019t want them at the wedding. Especially considering I now have one living parent, who is really important to me and who they have a history of being disrespectful and racist towards, I would much rather have a wedding where I know we won\u2019t have to deal with them and their drama.\n\nHere\u2019s the dilemma: I\u2019m really close with my cousins (their kids), and I want them at my wedding, but not their parents. To clarify, my cousins are all grown adults living on their own and are able to make decisions for themselves about whether to come to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to create any tension between my cousins and their parents by inviting my cousins but not Kristin, Jack, and Angela.
