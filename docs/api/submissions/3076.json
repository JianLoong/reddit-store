{"id": 3076, "submission_id": "z2wpdq", "title": "AITA for not wanting to take care of my grandparents full-time?", "selftext": "I (25M) recently decided to visit my dad for an extended (2 week) vacation, going from Chicago to a small, rural beach town in Florida. Since I work remotely, I am splitting my time down here between taking days off and working. I thought I would be staying with my dad, but he is full up at his house, so instead I am staying with my grandparents, who live in the same town.\n\nWhen I arrived, it quickly became apparent that my dad had undersold my grandparents' condition. While neither need a full time nurse or anything, they clearly need a lot of extra help around the house. Which, to be clear, I am perfectly fine doing. I just wish I had been informed of this beforehand.\n\nOn my first day back working, my grandma fell and sustained a minor injury. She was taken to the hospital and has recovered, but I've basically been attending to my grandpa's every need since then while also working a full time job from home.\n\nWell it was determined that my grandparents need something closer to full time help around the house and they've settled on... me. They told my dad this, and he immediately started setting things up for me to more or less move down to Florida full time until my grandparents can be moved into an assisted living facility (which would take months, at least). This includes him paying half my rent and bills for Chicago because I'm still on a lease for another year. As usual with my dad, this was not an ask, he was \"telling me what was going to happen.\"\n\nI've never been good at sticking up for myself, but I immediately put my foot down. I told him in no uncertain terms that when my scheduled return flight was coming, I would be on it to go back to my life in Chicago. My apartment and friends were there, not to mention that as a gay man, I will always be more comfortable living in Chicago than rural Florida. My dad told me he was disgusted with me for not helping family, and seemed to hint he wasn't going to take me to the airport regardless. I have no access to my own transportation down here.\n\nAITA for not being willing to take this on? I love my grandparents and they do need more help, I just can't be the one to do it, especially since it was not my choice. I have my own life too, but I feel real shitty now for not being willing to stay behind and abandon Chicago for a few months.", "created_utc": 1669228341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2wpdq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He deliberately planned this with the intention to trap you there. Im a full time caregiver on top of school full time and a side business. It is not easy and it is not for everyone and even if you did do it you wouldnt be able to do it completely alone trust me.
