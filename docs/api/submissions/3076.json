{"id": 3076, "submission_id": "z2wpdq", "title": "AITA for not wanting to take care of my grandparents full-time?", "selftext": "I (25M) recently decided to visit my dad for an extended (2 week) vacation, going from Chicago to a small, rural beach town in Florida. Since I work remotely, I am splitting my time down here between taking days off and working. I thought I would be staying with my dad, but he is full up at his house, so instead I am staying with my grandparents, who live in the same town.\n\nWhen I arrived, it quickly became apparent that my dad had undersold my grandparents' condition. While neither need a full time nurse or anything, they clearly need a lot of extra help around the house. Which, to be clear, I am perfectly fine doing. I just wish I had been informed of this beforehand.\n\nOn my first day back working, my grandma fell and sustained a minor injury. She was taken to the hospital and has recovered, but I've basically been attending to my grandpa's every need since then while also working a full time job from home.\n\nWell it was determined that my grandparents need something closer to full time help around the house and they've settled on... me. They told my dad this, and he immediately started setting things up for me to more or less move down to Florida full time until my grandparents can be moved into an assisted living facility (which would take months, at least). This includes him paying half my rent and bills for Chicago because I'm still on a lease for another year. As usual with my dad, this was not an ask, he was \"telling me what was going to happen.\"\n\nI've never been good at sticking up for myself, but I immediately put my foot down. I told him in no uncertain terms that when my scheduled return flight was coming, I would be on it to go back to my life in Chicago. My apartment and friends were there, not to mention that as a gay man, I will always be more comfortable living in Chicago than rural Florida. My dad told me he was disgusted with me for not helping family, and seemed to hint he wasn't going to take me to the airport regardless. I have no access to my own transportation down here.\n\nAITA for not being willing to take this on? I love my grandparents and they do need more help, I just can't be the one to do it, especially since it was not my choice. I have my own life too, but I feel real shitty now for not being willing to stay behind and abandon Chicago for a few months.", "created_utc": 1669228341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2wpdq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my/", "score": 499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just think there won't be very much time left and I don't want you to come to regret missing out on THIS time.", "And keep it to yourself!\n\nOr dad will find a way to sabotage it.", "NTA.  Your dad jumped on this because it makes things easier for him & without any regard as to what it would cost you (not just monetarily, but in all aspects of your life).  Your life isn\u2019t his to cash in on or control.  You aren\u2019t his or anyone else\u2019s indentured servant.  Don\u2019t let him or anyone treat you as such.  \n\n(Don\u2019t worry about a ride to the airport - you could walk all the way there and be better off than allowing that to force you into staying under his thumb.)", "NTA.\n\n> I have no access to my own transportation down here.\n\nCan you bite the bullet on a taxi/Uber? I know it'll likely be egregiously expensive, but sacrificing your life in Chicago because you can't get to an airport in Florida is just not a good idea.", "NTA\n\nyour father is desperate to trap you into doing this. he would rather pay your bills in chicago than take care of his own parents. if i were you i would snag an uber to the airport and leave on the next flight out if at all possible.\n\nthe sad thing is that your dad doesn't have to do this. if they qualify for assisted living, then they already qualify for in-home care. there are agencies ALL OVER every single state that provide a range of home-care services where they send what basically amounts to a helper that is halfway between a nurse and a nanny to come to an elderly person's house. they stay anywhere from an hour to a full 8 hours or sometimes even overnight in shifts depending on the needs of the client. they do things ranging from cooking meals and cleaning to helping with bathing and hygiene and a lot of the times just basically being there as emotional support and company.\n\nif you let yourself get conned into taking care of them, even for the short term, it will inevitably become long term. if you're there, then why should your father keep trying to get them into a nursing home? you're there doing everything they would do, after all! \n\nthe excuses are predictable too. your dad will just lie every time you ask and say he's still waiting to hear back from medicare, or from their insurance, or he'll say he can't afford a nice enough facility just yet.\n\ni've been in this situation, wiht a few differences. my dad was taking care of his mother but he died suddenly of an aneurysm. so i picked up the slack. the family fought me for every single benefit and bit of assistance i tried to get for my grandmother through medicare and her insurance, but refused to put her in a facility because they wanted her property and medicare would have taken the house after she died. \n\nyour dad wants you to take care of his parents so he doesn't have to put them in a facility, and he's probably doing it so he can keep their property when they die. if they go to assisted living, they'll either be forced to sell the property, or it will be taken by medicare when they pass on. if your dad wants to keep them out of an elder-care home, he should be the one moving in with them.", "NTA. Is there some reason your dad doesn\u2019t take the job on? Sounds like he\u2019s happy to be done with it and is bulldozing you. Go back to Chicago. Call your Grandparents often, send cards, small, thoughtful gifts but stay where you are.", "NTA.  What the hell.  You come to visit for 2 weeks and I\u2019m sorry, stick you at your grandparents and then expect you to change your life to suit them.  Tell dad if he thinks family is so important he should be taught care of his parents.  In the meantime I would try to find alternate transportation to the airport.", "NTA, he's disgusted at you, but he's not jumping to take on the responsibility either, is he?", "Caring full time for two elderly people is a huge undertaking that gets harder with every passing day.  This is not something everyone is capable of doing and certainly not without backup.\n\nDad is the AH here for assuming that his barking a command automatically obligates you to obedience.  You are no longer a child, nor his employee, nor a soldier under his command.  He is also not God who has the inherent right to decide what constitutes acceptable moral behaviors.\n\nIs there another way that you can contribute to helping your grandparents?  For example, could you provide some funds for hiring in home care?  Perhaps several family members could pitch in to pay for that?  In my experience there are home caregivers who will contract for a certain number of hours per week with specific tasks to be accomplished.  It isn't cheap but it is usually more economical to have helpers come into the home than to put the patients into assisted living communities.\n\nBy all means keep to your boundaries.  I have taken care of several elderly relatives and I can tell you from experience that what seems desirable is not always possible.  Do what you can and don't feel guilty for not doing what you cannot.  NTA", "NTA lmao why doesn't your dad take care of them? they're HIS parents.", "NTA  that's not a decision anyone else can make for you! Not even your dad.", "NTA. It is a huge responsibility and unless you are confident and willing then don\u2019t do it nigh need to tell your dad no. You have to work and you won\u2019t be able to do so if you are a full time caregiver.", "If dad can afford to pay part of OPs rent in Chicago so OP would care fr grandparents , he can afford t hire help for them.  OP is NTA.  Don\u2019t stay\u2026I wouldn\u2019t trust your dad to actually get them in a list for assisted living.  Once you\u2019re there it will turn into years, not a few months.", "I was thinking the same thing if OP's Dad can afford half of Chicago rent then he can definitely afford some amount of home health care then he should be doing the rest. He should look into what insurance SSI or Medicare will cover too. It just seems like strong arming OP is his go to solution. NTA and run OP.. if you are worried about grandparents look into insurance coverage options for them from Chicago.", "So many people do not understand that I actually have to still do a full day of work.... Just from my home office. Sorry, I can't wait for the contractor or sign for your delivery if I'm in a meeting.", "NTA\n\nDoes your dad seriously expect you to up and leave everything behind?", "NTA, your dad seems to be a manipulative type of person!", " NTA. Start now looking for someone to take you to the airport. There will be someone who will take you for gas money and a bit more.", "I'd go a step further and say he was set up from the start.

If your dad wants someone there, he can do it", "NTA. Dad should move in and care for them. You have to work. Fly home asap - this was a trap. If you stay, they will never go to assisted living.

Unless your employer already has nexus in Florida, they\u2019re not going to allow to you to relocate even for a few months.
