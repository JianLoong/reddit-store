Essentially we were able to buy a fixer upper for around 85k and secured a mortgage of 125k the difference being put towards renos. He couldn't get approved for the 85k mortgage on his own because he has horrible credit despite making a fair chuck more than I do annually so I essentially had to go 50/50 with him on the house to get the higher mortgage. \n\nNow I've worked in construction for several years at this point and knew how to do all the renos we had planned, my friend was a hard worker but didnt know jack all about building houses so I felt it was fair when he took on the brunt of the manual labour while I taught him the techniques and did all the math and designing.\n\nFast forward 1 year and we had completely stripped the outside down to the plywood, repaired some structural rot, re wrapped the house in tyvek, put vinyl siding over the whole house, replaced all 10 windows with new high end ones, reframed the interior to add a hallway for a nice sliding glass door out to the brand new 8x16 foot deck. And my friend put on brand new metal roofing over the whole thing.\n\nWe are now looking at a market value of 180-200k, which is around 55k profit. My friend wanted to take me off the house to fully own it himself so I offered to take 5k and I'd walk. He then started to insult me and threaten me saying it was all his house the whole time and since he was paying the mortgage (i live with my gf at her house and pay rent there instead) that he could sue me and I'd be forced out of my ownership. Now I've talked to a lawyer and that is simply not true but legal arguments aside, am I the asshole for expecting a buyout if he did most of the physical labour and is making the mortgage payments?\n\nEdit: just thought I'd clarify. I put several hours of labour into these renovations. For all purposes he was the general labour and I let him handle the less important jobs on his own. I did not however just show him how to frame and left him to it.

And again why bother with all this crap for 5k?", "Where I'm from, OP not paying the mortgage would legally sway the argument towards his friend. 5k does sound like a reasonable buyout but I got to go with ESH for both of them going into this with no clear terms", "This guy knows how to mortgage", "Legally I'm entitled to half the house. assuming we sell it for 180 that means we both get 90k. I technically owe 62.5k on the mortgage since I haven't made any payments so I would be left with around 27k profit. Since he is paying on the mortgage he would get what he paid into it back plus the 27k profit  This is how the lawyer explained it to me at least.", "OP loaned out his good name. He took a risk he did not have to.\n\nOP used his skills to design the renovation, without pay.\n\nOP taught his friend how to do the work, and worked beside him, without pay.\n\nOP was trying to be kind, offering to sign the house over to his friend for $5k, when he knew his labor alone was valued at a significantly higher amount.\n\nWithout OP, the friend would have had *no idea* how to fix up the home. He could have removed load bearing walls, chosen inappropriate materials, created dangerous electrical conditions, or flooded his basement, and likely would have had to sell the home in worse condition than he bought it in, or pay someone to fix it.", "If a husband and wife buy a house in both names, and the wife stays at home, while the husband earns the money to pay for the home, she has an equal right to the home. *She* did not \"pay\" the mortgage, but her name is on it.\n\nIf I add my adult child's name to my mortgage so it will pass to him upon my death, he will have paid nothing for it, but will still be a 50% owner until my death, when it will become \"his house\".\n\nBoth names are on the deed and the loan. The bank neither *knows* nor *cares* where the money comes from as long as it comes.", "For a married couple or child/parent/immediate family member yes that makes sense.", "How about unmarried couples? Friends? My TWO kids, to whom I leave my home when I pass? It is *presumed* that \"shared ownership\" is a 50/50 arrangement, which is why it is recommended that one NOT buy a home with someone one does not fully trust.", "Unmarried couples are not recognized here unless maybe engaged. Friends as well they will try to split 50/50 but if one can prove that they made most of the payments it would be favourable to the payer unless there was some other type of clear contribution the other person can prove. Children/dependants is different, it would go by the will and if there is none house sold and split equally unless one sibling is willing to buy out the rest."]}
