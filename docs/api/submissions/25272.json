They essentially said \"How much of your life do you waste matching your socks? If it takes 5 minutes once or twice a week, you add that up and it takes over 4 hours per year for once a week. Twice a week and you have a full 8 hour shift a year just matching socks. Multiply that my 50 years and  you waste anywhere between 10-20 full 24hr days of your life matching socks.\" \nI'm not the most productive with my time but that seems like a lot for such a useless and unnecessary task.", "NTA...You respect her way, so she should respect yours. This is how you keep a healthy relationship.  This is not even worth a battle.

I buy socks that are unmatched.   My unmatched socks are my favorite.    I think the name of the brand is Unmatched socks.", "NTA.\n\nWe're in the same boat. I meticulously handle my partner's clothes, who's rather fussy about it; meanwhile, mine get thrown in a drawer. He can't stand how wrinkly most of my clothes are but it just doesn't mother me much. I'm not even confident all of my socks have their partners anymore.\n\nWhat a charmed life your girlfriend must lead that the concern of matching socks is the thing that keeps her up at night... ah, to live such a life...", "Jeez. You do match up hers so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing something that actually impacts her. You don\u2019t care about the matches most days so she should back off.

It seems to be a pet peeve of hers (and don\u2019t we all have some of those, I\u2019m pretty sure there are also small absolutely unimportant things she does that you dislike) and maybe consider matching yours, just for her, not for you. :D\nIt doesn\u2019t take much time and probably would make her happy. Not much effort required :)", "She has OCD. If at all you aren't lazy or stubborn enough to CBA, understand this and respect her.

I do the same, for family reasons.", "NTA-   \n\n\nBUT  \n\n\nThis is obviously a concern for her (probably something along the lines of how you dress reflects on her in some way)  \n\n\nIf it is a non issue for you, then you are doing it now just to prove a point or spite her.  \n\n\nTime for some compromise.  \n\n\nIf it really doesn;t matter to you, take the two minutes to match up your socks.  Why cause your GF some stress/embarassment when minimal effort on your part can make her life easier?  That's aprt of being in an adult relationship.  \n\n\nIf it is that much of an imposition, you can politely let her know that if thsi sort of thing is embarassing for her, that you don;t mind her organising your socks in a mannner she likes.  \n\n\nBut seriously, this sounds more and more like you are just doing it to annoy her.

When we got married, I took over the laundry at which point I matched and rolled his socks. I got sick and he stopped marching them. It was never an issue, I was rolling mine, so I did his too. Here's my point, if she really wants you to wear matching socks, she should match them. Otherwise, this is the dumbest hill to die on ever. Does she always treat arguments as a war to win? That's a red flag. The goal of an argument is to find a solution. Also, arguments should be chosen wisely. \nNTA.", "NTA \n\nIf she feels the need for your work socks to be matched up, she can do it.

When my partner and I first moved in together,  I used to do his laundry and iron his clothes...  He didn't give a shit about ironed clothes or doing the laundry the way I wanted and it drove me nuts. So guess how we solved it?  I also stopped giving a shit. I don't iron his clothes and he does his own laundry now.  Your gf probably needs to stop caring about your socks and free up some mental space in her head.", "NTA.

They're socks.  Who cares if they don't match.  The issue is your gf has some sort of ocd about your socks.  But that's the thing, it's HER issue, not yours.  She's making a big deal out of nothing.

Meaning he would pair ankle socks with long ones. I don't even know how he got them to fold together! We had so many fights about it because he \"couldn't see the difference\" which is ridiculous when I e sock is three times larger than the other.\n\nHowever, your girlfriend just wants everything matching.

Seems like this is a quick fix that you are making more difficult.", "I'm giggling over this because my boss has such a thing about my socks, it became a running joke (both F30s, she's actually an awesome boss).

Then I ahve black socks for work and white socks for leisure.  \n\n\nEvery year or two, I wash them all, donate them to Amvets, and buy two walmart packs of each color. Then ALL the black socks match and all the white socks match.", "Also, if you don't give a shit about pairing and one sock gets a hole in it, you can just toss that one and not the whole pair. It just makes more sense!", "I've tried not matching my black socks, but they all feel different depending on how many times they've been worn and washed, and if I get an 'uneven' pair it drives me absolutely bonkers.", "Oh heck yes. Socks that LOOK different, no big deal. Socks that FEEL different would drive me nuts the whole time.  \n\n\nWonder if the gf is unable to stop imagining what her own feet would feel like in mismatched socks. Maybe a tad OCD?", "I don't wear mismatched socks, and personally if my bf wore mismatched socks bc 'nobody will see them' I would a) dread the time when coincidence will have it that for whatever reason people will see and b) get the same feeling as when a picture is hanging crooked on the wall but you're not able/allowed to adjust it. I don't have OCD, I think different people are just bothered by different kinds of breaches of decorum/norms. I'm very wear whatever you like and if mismatched socks are your style then cool - but if you just can't be bothered and don't care how it looks - and we're a couple so it'll inevitably get associated with me - that's when it starts bothering me. Still wouldn't make demands or call my partner an AH over it, but it would peck at me quietly.\n\nOn the other end of it, I never got the point of making the bed and have had arguments with an ex over it because he felt wrong if it wasn't made \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So I kinda get both sides here."]}
