Our daughter is 25 and our son is 21. Both of our children are adopted from foster care. Our daughter was 2 when she came into our home and our son was 11 weeks old. As parents, my husband's and my main goal was always to make sure our children grew up into good people and felt loved and supported by us through all the stages of their lives.\n\nOur daughter is now married to a wonderful man, Taylor, and they just had their first child together.\n\nI had a bit of a run in with my daughter's MIL at the hospital when we went to visit. My daughter's MIL and FIL have always struck me as somewhat arrogant and my husband and I have both felt like they have made jabs at the fact my husband and I were \"older parents\". Taylor's parents had him when they were 18 and they are grandparents at 43 now. Apparently this is something that makes them superior to my husband and I as grandparents, according to Taylor's mom.\n\nThis all started out when we were invited to come meet the baby and see Taylor and our daughter. My husband and I first went to check on how our daughter was doing and if she needed anything. Taylor's parents went straight for the baby. When we were leaving my husband went to use the restroom and Taylor's mom followed me and suggested that I was some grandparent when I showed no enthusiasm to meet my grandson. I asked what she meant by that and she said I ignored him for the first ten minutes. I corrected her and said I did not ignore my grandson, I checked on my baby first, because childbirth can be difficult. She asked how I would know that and then said it must be my age that makes me less interested in grandbabies. I was shocked as this was the most blatant insult she had directed my way. She then said that she and her husband will be the beloved grandparents because they're young enough to run around with our grandson and play with him without breaking a hip or destroying their backs. I told her she knew nothing about me to say this. She said clearly being old parents came with the disadvantage of being old grandparents and that would not be fun for a child.\n\nI told her I would rather be an older grandparent than trying to be a grandparent while still behaving like a child myself. She was furious and I felt bad immediately because I only inflated the problem.\n\nMy husband and I left and he suggested we should speak to Taylor in case his mother twisted things. I didn't want to interrupt their first day as a family of three so I waited for a couple of days. At that point Taylor knew something was up with his mom. We talked and he told me not to worry about it. He apologized for his mom and asked if his parents had been like that with us previously.\n\nHis mother, however, has said I declared a grandparent war and that I am clearly looking down my nose at her for being a teenage mother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693559678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16723nb/aita_for_implying_my_daughters_mil_is_a_child_to/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She deserved way more than that. That audacity, wwwwwaaaaauuuuw. But don't worry, you'll probably turn out to be the preferred grandparents. If Taylor is a wonderful man and I can only imagine your daughter is to, the kids are gonna turn out good too... and kids see through the kinda shit this lady is putting forward. Don't worry.  \nYou might have made it a bit worse... but with her personality is would only have been a matter of time before she pulled another stunt. You guys would have come to blows at some point I bet, and there's no honor in being the bigger person all the way while being trashed. You need to push back when you meet a bully and that's what you did. The jab you took at her personality is NOTHING compared to what she threw at you.", "Nta ! Even when you \"snapped\" at her you made it gracefully by pointed out her childish/ageism behavior. You have a son in law whom said sorry (wasnt his role ) bc he knows his parents were at fault. Keep doing what you do : beeing \u00e0 great support !!!!!  NTA", "NTA\n\nThere is no correct way to approach someone who has just given birth. There are too many things to worry about.\n\n>Apparently this is something that makes them superior to my husband and I as grandparents, according to Taylor's mom.\n\nNo it just means they don't use protection....\n\nI'm sure you will win the grandparent war and you will be a wonderful grandparent for years to come.\n\nDon't worry about being older parents. My parents are 60+ and they have still told us they are not ready to be a grandparent yet :D", "Wtf. \n\nNTA if this actually happened but this some twilight lifetime shit, who actually does this?", "NTA - what a weird thing for her to be competitive about.  She obviously feels insecure enough to try and make you feel small.", "NTA, what she said was so much worse. She kept pushing, you retorted appropriately.\n\nAlso, this one here stood out for me:\n\n> He apologized for his mom and asked if his parents had been like that with us previously.\n\nTo me, that implies there's a possibility he's aware of his parents being dicks, and doesn't tolerate it either. Good guy.", "Nta and it says a lot that Taylor was on your side too", "NTA ,the MIL thinks she is s teenager or something,you did nothing wrong don't apologize if anyone she should, you're a great mother age doesn't matter.She's in the wrong you are feeling bad for defending yourself don't.", "NTA - this woman IS acting like a child. Based on her response to Taylor, it sounds like she\u2019s projecting her insecurities about being a YOUNG grandparent onto you by pointing out all the \u2018bad things\u2019 about being an \u2018old\u2019 grandparent to you. \n\nBetter to kneecap this kind of behavior and it actually gave a chuckle because it was such an apt response.\n\nMoving forward it sounds like Taylor needs to sit down with his parents and explain some boundaries and keeping stupid opinions to themselves.", "NTA - the mil is insecure and reverted to insults to make herself feel more important. \n\nWatch you back, this woman hasn\u2019t matured past the point she had her first child and will cause drama for your daughter to hurt you.", "NTA - Why does it have to be a competition if you all love and support your children and grandchild?", "NTA This honestly hurts my heart because I can tell that you and your husband are very sweet and wonderful people, parents, and grandparents. Not only did she make many rude comments about your age, but she also made a really stupid jab at you being an adoptive* parent, like it's some sort of secret childbirth is difficult? WTF? I'm sorry you had to deal with this. Honestly, though, a lot of the grandparents who behave like this are really only interested in the image of being a grandparent and the social media photo op.

That woman is insecure about the turns her life took at a teen, and the choices she made at that age.  She decided that taking those insecurities out on you because she seemed to think you were an easy target.  You just showed her that you are not.  Unfortunately, I doubt this will be the only time she pulls this kind of thing.  Also be prepared for her to try to do all she can to monopolize baby time with the goal of keeping you away.  Don't bend to her games, but also don't try to bring your son in law, and daughter into the middle of it.  Continue to use grace in the face of selfishness.", "You actually handled the insult with so much class- and as someone who has lost their mother, I thought it was beautiful that you checked on your daughter. Obviously, the five minutes you took to do that in no way shows you don\u2019t care about your grandchild.\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t EVER be ashamed or let ANYONE shame you about being an older grandparent. My father was 73 when my son was born and my husband\u2019s parents were in their 60s and the relationship he has with all of them is magical. Unfortunately, my father is not very mobile and his English language skills are not great but his love for his grandson is and there are many things they share and can still do together. And my in-laws are not as active as they were with their other grandkids (my husband is the youngest of the five kids) but they still take him on holidays and outing.

I LOVE that you checked in with your child before running to see your grandchild!  New moms often get forgotten in the excitement of a new baby and you showed the correct priorities.  This is actually one of the reasons I\u2019m considering having no visitors at my next child\u2019s birth (it was a non issue with kid 1 since she was born in 2020).

She is a grown woman without the decency to stop making this milestone for her CHILD about herself. Don't you apologise to her for being blunt about her behaviour.", "Man...Taylor's parents are super OLD for grandparents. My cousin became a grandmother at 37, and she is 38 now. Her daughter is a 21 year old mother. But you are NTA for implying that she is a child, because she is.

I'm sure she appreciated that you had the insight and cared about her enough to dote on her a little bit first. The MIL sounds like she is actually jealous for some reason and seems to feel like she is competing with you, so it's a her problem and not you.

The escalation in what she said to me at the hospital has still left me puzzled and I'm not sure why she and her husband took such an issue to my husband and I.", "Leaning more toward ESH. You're feeding this \"war\" by exchanging defensive comments, which lead an insecure (at best) woman to double down. How about pushing the view that BOTH sets of grandparents are so fortunate to have this child to love, & that any age difference (if that subject cannot be laid to rest) means the kid will experience so much more as each set of grandparents  spoil them in different ways. Then drop it/refuse to rise to bait. Don't complain to daughter/SIL, don't escalate anything. Hate your counterpart in silence, but drip honey when you must meet. Expect her to try to \"steal\" moments (holidays, for example) that she'll characterize as \"too much work\" (for someone as old as you). Equal time w/the couple & baby may be the hill you die on (figuratively!), not who may best equipped physically to play ball or trudge around the zoo. Try to turn supporting the new family into a team sport. There should be exhaustion enough to go around 3 or 6 or 12 months from now!", "Someone who is insecure perhaps? I don't know them well enough to say if they are but it would give that impression. Or maybe they're jealous.", "I don't know. But they want a competition for some reason.", "The comment about my lack of experience giving birth did feel spiteful.

As an example:  \nYou've never implied anything about her being a teen mom, but she brings it up? She has insecurities about that because of norms in society and she's now projecting that onto you. How can she spin it in a positive way for her? Now she's young, but and adult, and youth is perceived as something positive - so she's throwing that at you because your older. Now she can feel better about herself, now that she's established that she has an advantage on you.   \nShe might just be a horrible human throughout, but this behaviour also looks like it's coming from her having had to defend herself and feeling judged. So now she kicks before she gets kicked. The competitiveness is her lack of self worth which comes out in a weird narcissistic way where she needs to feel better than other people to feel okay about herself. \n\nNot gonna diagnose her, but people can have narcissistic traits without having the personality disorder. Take a look at this description:  \n\"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which **people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance**. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. **But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth** and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.\"", "She/they are insecure about being grandparents.
