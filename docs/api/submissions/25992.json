She then said that she and her husband will be the beloved grandparents because they're young enough to run around with our grandson and play with him without breaking a hip or destroying their backs. I told her she knew nothing about me to say this.

I didn't want to interrupt their first day as a family of three so I waited for a couple of days. At that point Taylor knew something was up with his mom. We talked and he told me not to worry about it.

Don't worry.You might have made it a bit worse... but with her personality it would only have been a matter of time before she pulled another stunt. You guys would have come to blows at some point I bet, and there's no honor in being the bigger person all the way while being trashed. You need to push back when you meet a bully and that's what you did. The jab you took at her personality is NOTHING compared to what she threw at you.", "Nta ! Even when you \"snapped\" at her you made it gracefully by pointed out her childish/ageism behavior. You have a son in law whom said sorry (wasnt his role ) bc he knows his parents were at fault.

My parents are 60+ and they have still told us they are not ready to be a grandparent yet :D", "Wtf. \n\nNTA if this actually happened but this some twilight lifetime shit, who actually does this?", "NTA - what a weird thing for her to be competitive about.  She obviously feels insecure enough to try and make you feel small.", "NTA, what she said was so much worse. She kept pushing, you retorted appropriately.\n\nAlso, this one here stood out for me:\n\n> He apologized for his mom and asked if his parents had been like that with us previously.\n\nTo me, that implies there's a possibility he's aware of his parents being dicks, and doesn't tolerate it either.

Not only did she make many rude comments about your age, but she also made a really stupid jab at you being an adoptive* parent, like it's some sort of secret childbirth is difficult? WTF? I'm sorry you had to deal with this. Honestly, though, a lot of the grandparents who behave like this are really only interested in the image of being a grandparent and the social media photo op.

You're feeding this \"war\" by exchanging defensive comments, which lead an insecure (at best) woman to double down. How about pushing the view that BOTH sets of grandparents are so fortunate to have this child to love, & that any age difference (if that subject cannot be laid to rest) means the kid will experience so much more as each set of grandparents  spoil them in different ways. Then drop it/refuse to rise to bait. Don't complain to daughter/SIL, don't escalate anything. Hate your counterpart in silence, but drip honey when you must meet. Expect her to try to \"steal\" moments (holidays, for example) that she'll characterize as \"too much work\" (for someone as old as you). Equal time w/the couple & baby may be the hill you die on (figuratively!), not who may best equipped physically to play ball or trudge around the zoo.

As an example:  \nYou've never implied anything about her being a teen mom, but she brings it up? She has insecurities about that because of norms in society and she's now projecting that onto you. How can she spin it in a positive way for her? Now she's young, but and adult, and youth is perceived as something positive - so she's throwing that at you because your older. Now she can feel better about herself, now that she's established that she has an advantage on you.   \nShe might just be a horrible human throughout, but this behaviour also looks like it's coming from her having had to defend herself and feeling judged. So now she kicks before she gets kicked. The competitiveness is her lack of self worth which comes out in a weird narcissistic way where she needs to feel better than other people to feel okay about herself. \n\nNot gonna diagnose her, but people can have narcissistic traits without having the personality disorder. Take a look at this description:  \n\"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which **people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance**. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. **But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth** and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.\"", "She/they are insecure about being grandparents.

You guys sound like you\u2019ll be great grandparents!\nETA: almost forgot to add that my dad likes to refer to himself as a professional grandpa now lol", "Pay her no mind. My mom was 34 when she had me, and while I don't have children she's an amazing 69 year old grandmother to my nieces and nephews!", "I turned 27 in June, and my mom is 65\u2026I may *call* her old but in reality, she\u2019s really not and I would like her to live much much longer.", "I'm going to assume you are retired, apologies in advance if you are not. You should tell her how thrilled you are that you can spend as much time as you can with your daughter and grandson and are looking forward to being able to take him for visits to the zoo and museums or out for walks in the park while they will only be able to see him on weekends.", "My parents are 65 and 60 are our my in-laws. My son was born last year \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso I find it weird that she\u2019s flexing that she had a kid at 18. Usually that means a lapse of judgement and society looks down on that (I\u2019m not saying I do, but it certainly is what I\u2019ve experienced).  NTA and good on you for checking in with your daughter. Moms are people too lol \u2014 some people  treat us like just human  incubators.", "I had my baby late. I was 39 my parents are almost 70. There is no difference in how they act around my kid. You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "Y\u2019all are around the same age as my grandparents were when I was born! I love my grandparents and have always been super close to them.", "My grandparents were around your age when I was born and I loved every moment I spent with them. With how conscientious and caring you come across, you're going to be wonderful grandparents. Don't let their silliness rain on this beautiful time for your family.\n\nNTA.", "50 years ago that might have been old. Now it is not anymore. People get older and in your sixties most people are still in the mids of their lives. My FIL just turned 71 and he is literally living the life of a 30 year old. He fixes his own roof and goes scuba diving. He will outlive all of us and will probably die at the respectable age of 413. He is more active than most \u201cyoung\u201d people.\n\nBe the best grandparent you can be. Active or not (it doesn\u2019t matter). You sound more loving than the other grandparents.", "My parents have been in their 70s for all grandkids and they are wonderful supportive highly involved grandparents. And I just had my second kid at 43\u2026blows my mi d some people are grandparents!", "43 and a grandparent?? Sheesh! No offense to the grandparents in their 40\u2019s out there but it sounds like Taylor\u2019s mom is projecting some frustration and insecurities about being so young and flipping it on you by calling you old.", "It's a shame she's too immature to realize it's better to get along for the grandchild's sake, but maybe in a few years, she will grow up.", "The Great Grandparents are the best. My GGP in his late 70s or early 80s at the time got behind a chair with me in my parent's house and helped me put peanut butter in my parent's shag carpet.  Obviously, this was the late 1970s, but GGP was a big kid with both my dad and me.  He never really had a childhood because he started working at 9.", "NTA. Taylor knows his mom is a tool. She is probably rarely if ever called out on it.", "NTA. \n\nShe needs serious therapy.  Or logic lessons.  But in either case she should refrain from speaking until she has those.", "When my ex called my parents to say our son had been born the first questions were all about me, their only child, and then about the baby. Until the day she died my son, her grandson, was \"perfect\" (insert eye roll here) in her eyes but she (also a teen mother) still wanted to know how her child was first. You are NTA in any way whatsoever and Taylor's mother is still so insecure about her challenges as a teen mother she's abusing you to feel better about herself.", "NTA.  Your daughter\u2019s MIL is an ass.  She obviously wants to fuck around and find out.  Let her.  She is going to come out looking like the hypocritical ass she is.", ">Taylor's parents had him when they were 18 and they are grandparents at 43 now. Apparently this is something that makes them superior to my husband and I as grandparents, according to Taylor's mom.\n\nFrankly, I think this makes them worse grandparents than you. A vast majority of people aren't ready to be parents at 18. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear daughter\u2019s MIL feels insecure about being a teen parent and is doing what insecure, emotionally immature people do: pick on others to hide their insecurities.", "You're a lot nicer than I am. I would've congratulated her for getting raw dogged as a teenager and only managing to get pregnant in lieu of a plethora of std's. She can pound sand and you're NTA", "I like you. NTA. She sounds self- centered, narassistic and has main character syndrome. Be loving parents to your daughter and loving grandparents to your grandchild. This is not a competition. It might help if your daughter and son in law say nothing ( Information diet)  about you to his parents from now on.", "NTA.  Standing up for yourself when people act like that is important.  Why on earth would she want to start a grandma rivalry on day 1?   Your SIL's mom may have more energy but if she's causing chaos and being verbally abusive, she's going to learn about boundaries from the new parents.  Be a calming presence in the grandchildren' s lives.  You know, \"The Sane Grandma.\"   Checking on your daughter first was nice.", "This was by far the mildest insult I've ever seen anyone worry about. NTA", "NTA, she insulted your age first. Why\u2019s she getting pissy just \u2018cause you turned it back on her?", "You don\u2019t have to deal with her and you are NTA. His mother was petty and childish you gave it back to her which she deserved but from here on out, do not stoop to her level and take the high road. Her son I believes knows how his Mom is and it isn\u2019t the first time she has behaved this way. Love your Daughter, her husband and your new grandbaby. You are a great Mom and will be a great a grandparent. Congrats", "WOW!!  \nNTA!! Good for you for standing up for yourself. You can not allow some unhappy, insecure woman to insult and bully you like that. Stand up to her every time she pulls this crap, she'll either learn to keep her mouth shut or you'll have lots of fun putting her in her place! She's really a mean, rotten person. Who says those things?", "No one has pointed this out and it doesn't seem like you really picked up on it either but MIL also made a jab at you for being an adopted parent. When you told her that you were visiting your daughter because giving birth can be difficult she said \"how would you know\". As well as being insecure about being a teen mom, she also seems to look down on you for not being a \"bio mom\". \n\nNTA", "I love (not!) illogical people. The MIL is complaining that OP is looking down on her for being a teenage mother yet the MIL has had NO PROBLEM making snide comments about OP being an older grandmother. So which is it? How twisted up do you have to get to think that you can say whatever you want but the moment someone does the same to you it is \"humiliating and unfair\"???", "My dad is 71 and still bikes an average of 100 miles a week when he can. He'll clock 45 miles in two days sometimes. As you get older, age obviously does matter, but if you're healthy and can keep up, that's all that matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. It also seems like the mother in law might have some insecurities of having children so young. That's why she needs to feel like she's superior above all else. It keeps the narrative she's created in her head stable.", "NTA!! my grandparents were in their early 60s when i was born and i got 23 wonderful years with my grandfather and i still see my grandma every other weekend now. both of them were very involved in my childhood, including carrying my younger brother and i as small children, playing with us on the floor, and playing \u201cthe marsupial game\u201d (my grandpa had a very stretched out sweatshirt he would put on and would let my brother or i squish inside, then he would crawl around the floor with us swinging back and forth lol. we absolutely loved it and i still have the sweatshirt). in short, you are NTA at all and you still have plenty of time/ability to be a loving, involved grandparent. \u2764\ufe0f", "That's how old my own maternal grandparents were. My paternal grandfather was even older. We had a close and loving relationship with them. Don't listen to your daughter's IL.", "So about the same age as mine and my wife's parents (who will hopefully be grandparents in the next few years). Sounds like MIL is upset that some people have more going on in life than just procreation.", "You are about the same age as my parents. They are currently raising my 8 year old niece and have no trouble keeping up with her or their other grandkids. You'll be fine. \n\nI'm wondering if Taylor's mom is feeling old because she is now a grandma. Sometimes that hits people really hard. That could explain her obsession with calling you old.  It makes her feel better about herself. \"At least I'm not as old as OP\" type of thing.\n\nNTA", "These people sound incredibly immature to think being in your sixties is old. Also, being at grandparent at forty-three is not something to brag about."]}
