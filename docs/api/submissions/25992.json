She then said that she and her husband will be the beloved grandparents because they're young enough to run around with our grandson and play with him without breaking a hip or destroying their backs. I told her she knew nothing about me to say this.

She was furious and I felt bad immediately because I only inflated the problem.\n\nMy husband and I left and he suggested we should speak to Taylor in case his mother twisted things. I didn't want to interrupt their first day as a family of three so I waited for a couple of days. At that point Taylor knew something was up with his mom. We talked and he told me not to worry about it.

Don't worry.You might have made it a bit worse... but with her personality it would only have been a matter of time before she pulled another stunt. You guys would have come to blows at some point I bet, and there's no honor in being the bigger person all the way while being trashed. You need to push back when you meet a bully and that's what you did. The jab you took at her personality is NOTHING compared to what she threw at you.", "Nta ! Even when you \"snapped\" at her you made it gracefully by pointed out her childish/ageism behavior. You have a son in law whom said sorry (wasnt his role ) bc he knows his parents were at fault.

My parents are 60+ and they have still told us they are not ready to be a grandparent yet :D", "Wtf. \n\nNTA if this actually happened but this some twilight lifetime shit, who actually does this?", "NTA - what a weird thing for her to be competitive about.  She obviously feels insecure enough to try and make you feel small.", "NTA, what she said was so much worse. She kept pushing, you retorted appropriately.\n\nAlso, this one here stood out for me:\n\n> He apologized for his mom and asked if his parents had been like that with us previously.\n\nTo me, that implies there's a possibility he's aware of his parents being dicks, and doesn't tolerate it either.

Not only did she make many rude comments about your age, but she also made a really stupid jab at you being an adoptive* parent, like it's some sort of secret childbirth is difficult? WTF? I'm sorry you had to deal with this. Honestly, though, a lot of the grandparents who behave like this are really only interested in the image of being a grandparent and the social media photo op.

She decided that taking those insecurities out on you because she seemed to think you were an easy target.  You just showed her that you are not.

Unfortunately, my father is not very mobile and his English language skills are not great but his love for his grandson is and there are many things they share and can still do together. And my in-laws are not as active as they were with their other grandkids (my husband is the youngest of the five kids) but they still take him on holidays and outing.

You're feeding this \"war\" by exchanging defensive comments, which lead an insecure (at best) woman to double down. How about pushing the view that BOTH sets of grandparents are so fortunate to have this child to love, & that any age difference (if that subject cannot be laid to rest) means the kid will experience so much more as each set of grandparents  spoil them in different ways. Then drop it/refuse to rise to bait. Don't complain to daughter/SIL, don't escalate anything. Hate your counterpart in silence, but drip honey when you must meet. Expect her to try to \"steal\" moments (holidays, for example) that she'll characterize as \"too much work\" (for someone as old as you). Equal time w/the couple & baby may be the hill you die on (figuratively!), not who may best equipped physically to play ball or trudge around the zoo.

As an example:  \nYou've never implied anything about her being a teen mom, but she brings it up? She has insecurities about that because of norms in society and she's now projecting that onto you. How can she spin it in a positive way for her? Now she's young, but and adult, and youth is perceived as something positive - so she's throwing that at you because your older. Now she can feel better about herself, now that she's established that she has an advantage on you.   \nShe might just be a horrible human throughout, but this behaviour also looks like it's coming from her having had to defend herself and feeling judged. So now she kicks before she gets kicked. The competitiveness is her lack of self worth which comes out in a weird narcissistic way where she needs to feel better than other people to feel okay about herself. \n\nNot gonna diagnose her, but people can have narcissistic traits without having the personality disorder. Take a look at this description:  \n\"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which **people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance**. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. **But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth** and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.\"", "She/they are insecure about being grandparents.
