Those things we are taught not to hurt in preschool.", "That\u2019s categorically untrue. \n\nBeing a sugar baby and being a prostitute are both identified as types of \u201csex work\u201d, but they are not the same, and that\u2019s not the only difference. \n\nSugar babying is often legal because there is an emotional component to the relationship. They are usually hired for consistent companionship. Otherwise someone would just get a prostitute. They go on dates with their client, they text them, have phone calls. You could not outlaw sugar babying without running into legal problems with hyper-traditional couples who consent to an arrangement where the woman stays home and the man earns money and similarly buys her gifts and pays for her rent. Where do you draw the line of that being immoral? \n\nSecondly, not every sugar baby is having sex with their client. One of my friends worked as a sugar baby for years and never had sex with any of her clients. And that\u2019s not unique, lots of people in this thread have similar stories. Because again, they\u2019re hired chiefly for companionship, if someone wanted to just have sex, they would hire a prostitute.", "That\u2019s not even remotely the same. If you\u2019re gonna use a metaphor, use one that actually applies.", "Bruh, making fun of a sex worker/sugar baby by calling them a hooker IS slutshaming. He clearly thinks its weird/immoral for her to sell sexual favors, and him calling her a hooker is practically the same as him calling her a slut.", ">an escort is just a nicer sounding name for a hooker\n\nI mean.... I would expect my friends to talk to me in nice terms.\n\nHe didn't bother to ask what it involved, or how she felt.", "Yes 100% you are still participating in sex work. Not all escorts fuck every client but they are still sex workers", "What's an oppressive job? Also, I think sex and intimacy is really special and shouldn't be sold and bought. It's my opinion and for the same I don't respect the profession.", "you basically did. not sure what the point of that person's reply was lol", "Dude, there are m\u2019fers that pay to have conversations with women. Take them out to eat or buy them shit. There are SD/SB relationships that strictly platonic. Shit, there are financial doms who do nothing but take money with no sex involved. This world is larger then the small minds that inhabit it.", "So not approving it, gives you the right to be an asshole and insult your \"friends\"? If you actually care and you are concerned, you don't get anywhere by acting like this...", "Its not their place to approve of her career. Nobody but her should have any say in what she does with her career or life.  Again its \\*none of their business\\*. They can either support her or keep their mouths shut. The only valid complaint about her choices is just to make sure shes safe when doing this.", "No the fuck it does not. Why should anyone get the right to shame others for sex work. Theres nothing morally wrong with it from the sellers perspective. \n\nWomen do not deserve to be shamed for doing what they can to stay alive. Her turning to sex work is not some moral failing that she deserve to be mocked for.", "Yeah is I said you can have you opinions all you want, you still become the asshole when you start to just insult your friends. Like call them sex worker if you wanna go there, but it's obvious that hooker is a rude word/insult. Like what's next you gonna go up to a black friend, call them the n-word and post on reddit about how you are technically correct and think you are in the right? It's obvious that all these comments are obv just against it and therefore think it's fine.\n\nAs for oppressive jobs I'd say stuff like police. Any group of people, who are basically partially above the law and can use or willingly abuse this. Or for this specific scenario I guess pimps would be another one, a profession that already operates outside the law and abuses the people under it.", "Okaay then"]}
