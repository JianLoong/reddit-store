{"id": 26207, "submission_id": "169ukwh", "title": "AITA for not presenting a \"united front\"?", "selftext": "I (42M) and my wife, S, (40F), have a son, D, (15M). \n\nI have to travel a lot for work. It's never for very long, usually 2-3 days, sometimes a week at the longest, but I have to do it fairly often. I'm traveling about 1 week out of every month, if you add all the days up, although it varies some. It lets me make enough money for my wife to be a SAHM, though, and we're doing okay. With D being older, my wife has gone back to work, although it's part time.\n\nAnyhow, I came home from a trip, and found D was grounded for the week. I asked what had happened, and this is what I pieced together from my wife and my son: \n\nMy wife was talking about plans to go to an upcoming family reunion. D had asked if his uncle, my wife's brother, B (34M) was going to be there. My wife said yes, and my son said something to the effect of \"I'm not going to be there if that drunken bastard/asshole\" is going to be there. They disagree on exactly what word he used. My wife said that was uncalled for, that he was family. My son, and he admits this, then got much more... creative... in his language. My wife grounded him for a week. \n\nThe thing is, nothing D said was wrong. And he has reason to dislike B - a couple of years prior, at a family Christmas function, B had been drunk, cornered D in a bedroom, and laid into him about how he felt he didn't appreciate what he had, he was a spoiled brat, things like that. Nothing directly threatening or anything, or else the notion of him ever being around him again wouldn't even be a question, but, still, a kid cornered by an angry man on a drunken rant, I 100% understand my kid not wanting to have anything to do with B anymore.\n\nBut the entire family tolerates B. He was the baby of the family. He's constantly in financial (and occasionally legal) trouble, hell I've given him money at my wife's urging before. And when he's sober he's okay, he's actually quite friendly and charismatic, he does cabinet work and builds furniture and makes decent money at it, but... he's an alcoholic, and he has grand dreams and poor long term planning. And when he's drunk, as he often is, he tends to be an asshole. \n\nAnyway. When I heard what happened, I did something I know parents aren't supposed to do - I just overruled my wife's grounding, and told him I'd deal with it. Now my wife is pissed at me because we're supposed to \"show a united front\" on discipline,  and whenever my wife is upset at me, so is her entire family. But I just can't bring myself to agree on this one.

The first misstep was that although your son spoke negatively of your BIL due to his actions towards him earlier, what seemed to be your main focus in shielding him from any future encounters, your wife unfortunately chooses to ignore her brother's actions towards anyone, including her own son.  Which is why she felt the need to ground him while you were gone.  Yes you overruled her because you weren't there to help diffuse the situation when it happened because you couldn't protect him like when he went after your son a few years ago.  If this is the case, you're going to have a sit-down with your wife about finding a compromise, because if I were your son, I wouldn't feel that she's not protecting me from him.

Granted he should maybe use more appropriate language with his mother but thats hardly a reason to be grounded.", "NTA.  And why is your wife\u2019s whole family involved with how the two of you discipline your kid??   Wife needs to stick up for her son and for her marriage!", "YTA.  Don't make your kid go to the reunion.  That should have been your move. But the punishment was for the \"creative\" language that shouldn't be tolerated by kids talking to their mother. Next time he yells at her, you gonna sweep that under the rug too?  Huge AH. You did your son no favors by teaching him he can use abusive language to a lady. By all means, don't force him to be around the drunk but that doesn't sound like what the punishment  was for. Part time dad thinking he knows it all....I've saw that before.", "NTA\n\n\"...whenever my wife is upset at me, so is her entire family\".  That's a bigger problem staring at you in the face.", "It's basically \"he shouldn't speak about his family that way, I told him to stop talking about his uncle that way, and he kept doing it\". Not specifically the profanity per se, although that obviously was the bale of straw that broke the camel's back.", "And she doesn't care about the entire situation and how it affects her son.  Must be a happy household", "You are teaching your son how you want him to address conflict.\n\nHad he spoken to a teacher at school or a boss at a part-time job like he did his mother when conflict arises, it's not going to get him very far.\n\nSpeaking from experience, it is very hard to be sworn at by your child.  \n\nI would ask your wife about that aspect.", "Just because you tolerate that language, doesn't mean your wife or any woman should. You just taught him how yo be an AH. Congrats part time Dad."]}
