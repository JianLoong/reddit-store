I didn't think that was a good idea but I was worried he'd get angry if I just pushed it so I asked him if we could just cuddle for a while. I brought it up again by apologizing for my comment that I made about the hyphenated name, he said he didn't want to hyphenate our names anyway. We talked for a while about a lot like my family, culture and his family...etc but basically he felt like the odd one out. I reminded him again about how much my family, especially my parents and brother, love him and treat him like a son/brother. They really do treat him like the baby of the family because thats how they always treated me as the youngest. My extended family loves him as well.\n\nHe said he felt like he was still stuck with his shitty family even though he hasn't talked to any of them in years, and if our baby has his name it would be like he was connected with the baby through that name and not his family.\n\nI was dreading asking him this but based on comments in my other post it made too much seem not to at least ask. So I asked him if he thinks he would like taking my last name, so he didn't have to share his last name with them anymore. He said that he was too embarrassed to suggest this again to my family because he felt like it would look badly that he keeps changing his mind on this topic, like he didn't respect this decision or my family's name. I convinced him that they wouldn't feel that way and that I would help him with every step of the name changing process if he wants that. We ran it by my parents to prove to him they were ok with it and they were super supportive. He seems really happy about this decision and even excited while we were gathering all the info to make sure it's a smooth transition. I'm also planning to have some more detailed discussions with him about other things we never really discussed specifics of so we don't catch each other by surprise again haha.

It's unfortunate that men are often raised in a society that expects the wife to take on their name. They're viewed as less of a man, or there's a scandal, etc. Obviously that's not true!\n\n\nI did think he was embarrassed and unsure how to move forward about asking to take your name. I'm so glad you two could reopen the conversation. Key detail was the waiting, giving you both a chance to take a step back and not forcing it. \n\nWishing you, your hubby and baby nothing but the best!", "Oh this is a lovely update! Good on you both for talking it out and making what sounds like a really positive and wholesome decision for your family.", "Original\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wldaz/aita\\_for\\_assuming\\_our\\_kids\\_will\\_take\\_my\\_last\\_name/", "Very happy to read this outcome, OP. I hope he takes time to really reflect on what a kind and amazing person you are.", "YAY! You handled this like a boss.", "Where I live, when a couple gets married, one can legally change their name to their spouses name without filing any additional paperwork with the court. It\u2019s usually the woman who changes, but a man can take this option as well. Hubby may not need to pay a fee and you\u2019ll all have the same family names.", "I'm so pleased reading this, thank you for taking the time to post an update. I'm glad to hear that things have worked out for the very best. Open communication wins again! Cheers to your growing family.", "I am happy that this works for you. \n\nThis would have been my (m) one hill to die on. I am so proud about my name history.", "Happy transition of r/AmItheAsshole to r/MadeMeSmile , if you both keep that healthy relationship alive with discussion not by arguments, you will have \"I hope\" good marriage. You have my blessing, but I hope you both learned a lesson here.

He learned Spanish, converted to catholicism, became a member of the community. It was beautiful.", "My bio father and his family abused my sister and I when we were children. He in particular is a horrible human. I decided early on that life would be much easier if he wasn\u2019t related to me. I thought about changing my name as soon as I turned 18 but changing my name with college and grad school sounded very difficult. \n\nCoincidentally, I met my now husband in college and he has been one of my biggest supporters. I changed my name over so quickly to his after we got married, despite it being uncommon to do in my field, and I\u2019m so glad I did. I chose my nickname as a teenager so I\u2019ve been living life with a name I chose since our wedding. I\u2019m very proud to be his wife and to be part of his family. I\u2019m graduating grad school soon as \u201cDr Tink Smith\u201d and I am absolutely ecstatic. \n\nI\u2019m glad your hubby is comfortable now to change his name and talk about what was bothering him so much.

My mother in law thought it was really weird that I was giving our son his father's last name\ud83d\ude02 she wanted me to also add my name. I'm not related to anyone by blood that has my last name, it's my uncles father's last name \ud83d\ude02", "You sound like a very supportive partner. Cheers on how you both handled this situation.", "This is an awesome update! I know changing a name can be a huge hassle (it\u2019s part of the reason I didn\u2019t take my husbands name when we got married) but there are some services you can pay for to help with a name change depending on where you\u2019re located (I\u2019m in the USA). The prices range from $40-$165 for different levels of service. \n\nGood luck and all the best to you and your family!", "I was so glad to change my name. Not a horrible name just associated with my father. When my sons married I ask the DIL's if they were keeping or changing names. Guess they like the weird name cause they changed too. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "The last name change is a big outdated. It was a transfer of ownership as Mrs\u2019 is the best way to think about the Mrs. \n\nMy wife wanted to hyphenating her name I was not expecting her to change her name at all. I was the one who suggested our children be hyphenated as well as they are of both families and should carry the names and honor their heritage. I am sure she wanted the hyphenated names for our kids anyway, I just brought it up before the question was asked.", "Neither my wife nor I particularly liked either of our last names, so we just went through different names from both sides of our family and found one that sounded good and we both changed it to that.", "Yea that\u2019s really good", "For those of us who did choose to change our last name, thinking of Mrs as Mr's is kind of icky. I changed my name to my partners because I wanted to feel more like part of a family, since I didn't share my last name even with my own family. I'm not owned by my partner, and Mrs doesn't feel that way, it feels more like gatekeeping.", "our friend's combined their names together into an awesome new one, if that option works!"]}
