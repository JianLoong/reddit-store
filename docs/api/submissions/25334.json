Look, not to discourage anyone, it is ultimately a important job, especially with causes that involve social justice, and you can help a lot of people too, in my country we have public defenders, but they don\u2019t have enough attorneys to represent everyone that needs, so you can sign up to be a sort of substitute public defender and the court will call when needed, the state pays for this. I represented low income mothers trying to get child support, elderly workers trying to retire, injured or sick people fighting for health care (it\u2019s public here) or against insurance, and people arrested that can\u2019t afford a lawyer.

Less stress on you and probably less mess for everyone else to clean up.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSo NTA.\n\nGet rid of your roommate and buy your girl some flowers and a fancy dinner for helping you get rid of that schlub.\n\nPeople should be nice for the sake of being nice. Not because they know that it could backfire on them otherwise.", "Him: If I knew her parents were lawyers, I'd have paid my bills on time, cleaned up after myself, and been a good roommate. \n\nIt makes me wonder how many other people he screwed over.\n\nAlso him (to future roommates): Hey, uh, you don't have any lawyers in the family, do you? \nThem: No. Why? \nHim: Cool... leveling up being the worst roommate ever. \n\n\nTake him to small claims court and then get him out of your place. NTA", "She is certainly putting an end to his scamming behavior which has been of zero benefit to you.", "I like lawyers a shit load more than I like cops", "My dad was a labour lawyer and was a huge amount of help when I was first navigating the working world. It\u2019s real easy for employers to take advantage of the kids that don\u2019t know their rights, and that was never going to be me.", "I absolutely adore my divorce attorney.", "You just see the posts that actually require judgment. No garbage like \u201cI got bronchitis saving 10 orphan children from a house fire and it caused me to cough on someone, AITA??\u201d", "Do it for the rewards lol (build up them skymiles while paying the bills)", "Most utility companies will charge a cc fee that negates any miles/points earnings.", "NTA he fucked around and now it's time for him to find out. Tell him he has 30 days to move or you'll take him to court. Tell him your tired of his laziness and stiffing you on the bills", "Why don\u2019t you just let him move out? You are NTA and so is she. He would have behaved better if he\u2019d known there was a risk of consequences for his bad behaviour?\n\nThis is why I think society going through a period of overly-permissive parenting is starting to show its bad results now: he never learned as a child that there would be consequences for his behaviour.", "NTA - How would Joe moving out be a loss?  Is the rent so high that even dealing with a deadbeat is worth it. Talk to your landlord about taking him off at renewal time.", "Who's name is on the lease? Because your roommate Joel needs to go. If you share the lease talk to the landlord about getting out of it. But I would dump that slacker as quick as possible.", "Lol. Joe is an AH. I think it\u2019s laughable that he feels you need to disclose your your girlfriend\u2019s parents are lawyers. Stop covering for him. If his name is on the bills, it\u2019s his credit getting ruined. Suggest you move out, or at least advise the landlord why you want to move out. NTA", "INFO: Just how many people are living in this room?", "NTA\n\nGood riddance to Joe.\n\nWhat your GF's parents do for a living is beside the point.\n\nHe should pay his fucking bills in a timely manner, period.\n\nSounds like he has not given paying for a roof over his head a priority,  and deliberately left you two holding the bag.", "Yeah, the roommate being scared shitless and looking to run says a lot. Definitely a 'fuck around and find out' situation", "No she just killed the golden goose though, as in you covering him when he\u2019s late all the time.", "He\u2019s mad that she\u2019s far more assertive and has actual self respect and won\u2019t stand for his nonsense.\n\nAlso seriously he stopped doing chores because a woman moved in and thinks that\u2019s her job.  He\u2019s trash.", "Just have them send a cease and desist letter to Joe. He owes money + her unpaid labor fees because he expects a woman to be an automatic maid.", "She sounds like she might do well as a collections agent.  And she is definitely the one to have around when you're shopping for a car.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe is seeing little fins in the corner of his eye and hearing the Jaws theme in his sleep.  Because he might move out, but there's no escaping her.", "I think now you do .. or at least some utilities have begun reporting to the credit bureaus in the US.", "Depends on your country. Paying a bill on time is usually a good indication of being able to handle your finances which usually improves your  chances at getting loans and credit.", "Nice. Haha Got it", "NTA.   \"If I'd known there might be consequences I wouldn't have been such a shitty roommate\" isn't the resounding defense he thinks it is.", "NTA. I like your Gf.", "NTA Joe needs to step up and take responsibility.  It's not your job to continually cover for him and I don't blame your girlfriend one bit for being annoyed, he brought it on himself.  He needs to grow up and pay the bills on time, you give him the money on time, why can't he pay them on time?", "NTA.\n\nAnd your GF wins for fighting your battles for you and showing some spine in this mess-you are lucky to have her, she's a keeper. You have let your room mate bulldoze over you with late rent and utility fees and being messy around the house and it's only your GF who has had the cojones to put her foot down and follow through on setting your room mate straight. Go ahead and file the case against him and le him move out if he wants, it will make your lives cleaner and more peaceful.", "this made me lol. he's a piece of work.\n\nyou are NTA.", "NTA. These are the consequences of his actions, he\u2019s mad at you so he doesn\u2019t have to be mad at himself", "NTA.  Joe is TA and super sus.  \n\nYour GF might be right in suggesting that the utilities be in your name, but then Joe would have to pay you his share, right?  And he\u2019s consistently late with other responsibilities, too - so\u2026 assuming your LL wants nothing to do with utilities (rightfully so), it still may be in YOUR best interests to put the utilities in your name. (And you may have to if Joe moves out anyway).", "So his issue is he doesn't think he can get away with taking advantage of you anymore? \ud83e\udd14 NTA", "i love our family lawyer (helped us adopt, referred us to another lawyer for estate planning). i also like both real estate attorneys i've used over the years. and i still like my ex! \ud83d\ude02", "> nobody likes lawyers\n\nUntil they need one. lol", "Depends on the jurisdiction", "NTA OP", "\u2026and that\u2019s why people don\u2019t like lawyers lol. \n\nPerson above says they do this to help people who need it the most, but like all people in helping professions it\u2019s tough. \n\nYou respond by saying screw trying to make a difference, just get that money.", "If your girlfriend was your landlord's daughter, *that* would have been something worth disclosing. \n\nNot that she had a higher likelihood & ability to call him out on his shit. \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA", "So, Joe is angry because you moved someone into the house who stands up for herself and you. That\u2019s what this is really about. He\u2019s trying to convince you that all this is somehow your fault. **He\u2019s manipulative.**\n\nYeah, NTA. Let him move out. It sounds like he\u2019s dead weight anyway, and friends don\u2019t say \u201csue me\u201d when you ask them to pull their weight and pay their agreed upon expenses.", "Oh gosh NTA. I\u2019m not sure I have ever known what my roommates parents do for a living.", "INFO: did you ask your roommate before you moved in your girlfriend? Are expenses split with utilities 2/3 and 1/3 because there are now 3 of you? \n\nI feel like there\u2019s a lot of missing information here that\u2019s not helping people help you", "So he wouldn't have been a deadbeat and a slob if he knew she wouldn't just take it? Boo hoo. \n\nHe introduced court into the conversation so he can deal with the fall out of that. If he wants to leave, fine, he will have to work that out with the landlord. Shame he decided to be such an A H. \n\nNTA and your girlfriend sounds awesome.", "NTA. He knows he's a slacker and depends on you to let it slide.", "I'm probably overthinking it, but I can't help but wonder if Joe's got some secret he's worried will become public if lawyers start poking around in his affairs.", "Hey, I knew a lawyer whonused to come to my friend's parents halloween party every year and that dude was one of the most likeable people there. One time he had to take a call from a client, he stepped out of earshot but we could see him getting more and more annoyed. Right before he hung up, we all heard him yell, \"You don't want to keep dealing with this shit?! THEN STOP BREAKING THE LAW, ASSHOLE!\" Joined back up with the rest of us, apologized for having to step away for so long, then laughed about finally getting a chance to use his favorite movie quote.\n\nPlayed D&D with him a couple of times. It was kind of fun teaming up with a lawyer, since I'm the one in the group who usually finds the weird loopholes and hidden synergies in the rules. Not as much fun for the DM lol", "NTA. \n\n>he would have acted better\n\nJoe is just admitting that he was screwing you over because he thought he could get away with it.", "Not normal behaviour. \nHe\u2019s absolutely hiding something. \nBe wary and ideally get a place without him.", "He's just ticked that your gf stood up to him in a major way. He's used to taking advantage."]}
