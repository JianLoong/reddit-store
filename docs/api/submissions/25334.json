Your roommate is looking for an excuse to get the hell out of Dodge after he realized your GF won't let you cover his sorry a$$ anyymore (she's a keeper, BTW).

Make sure he paid all his rent and if possible, get rid of him.", "NTA, he's just ticked that your gf stood up to him in a major way.  He's used to taking advantage and even acting entitled.

Joe has been living his best life because you have been picking up his slack. GF called him on it and he is now running scared. He's trying to deflect the situation by making it about GF's parents.

If not, then you are wrong in that regard.\n\nBut Joe changing the tune of his behaviour when he found out your gf's parents are lawyers makes no sense. Maybe it's time for Joe to move out. Can you and your gf afford to rent his room too?", "NTA. Roommate is manipulative and just trying to shift the blame. Super cliche response. Time for roommate to move out probably. He is trying to financially manipulate you and get you to pay his share, and also trying to manipulate your gf into cleaning up after him lol. Whats the question here? let him leave, sounds like a relief", "Why didn't you warn him he can't still from you?.. \n\nNTA", "NTA Fucked about and found out lol", "Why do you even care what this loser thinks?  He said he would have acted better had he known they were lawyers?  Dump him", "He's a sus loser who thought he could get away with BS. Watch your back and your things. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You and your GF need to get out.", "NTA good riddance to Joe, he sounds super suspicious and like an ah roommate", "He is obviously hiding more \"shady\" stuff  from you.", "NTA at all\u2026 I don\u2019t know how you can even ask. He literally baited her and now feels scared because she said she could, he sounds like a crappy room mate.", "Oh, this is fun!!  Deadbeat roomie is mad because you can do exactly what he asked you to do when you asked for the money owed.  \n\nIt is none of anyone's business what someone's parents do for their living, NTA", "NTA Oh no, realistic consequences for his actions. And that would make him behave. You happy to live wth someone who has literally told you he'd have lived up to his obligations if known you had a way of enforcing them. But was happy to take advantage when you didn't. Good lesson for him.", "LOOOOL\nI\u2019m sorry this is hilarious, the only reason your lazy, asshole roomate is upset is because if your gf moves in, there could be actual consequences to his shitty behaviour.\nTell him to grow up and start acting like an adult.\nNTA but your roommate certainly is.", "She called his bluff and he don\u2019t like it.  Let him try to move.  Let\u2019s see how many people he can get to cover his freeloading butt regularly", "NTA. Joe was comfortable being a jerk. Your girlfriend just scared the shit out of him.  He now has to change his bad behavior because she called him on it (she\u2019s a keeper by the way).  Let him move out.  The new roommate will most likely be an improvement.", "NTA", "I would sue him just for funsies. would be great to have lawyer parents lol", "He\u2019s acting like my girlfriend killed his puppy or something. It\u2019s really pathetic.", "He'd be paying the utilities anyway, and if it's in his name then he knows it won't get shut off for Joe paying late", "Bc she did, dude. \n\nHe is taking advantage of you for years and she killed his ability to keep doing it by protecting his victim. For him thats exactly like she killed his puppy, even worse. \n\nNow he tries to guilt trip you into getting rid of her so he can go back to his easy life with you bailing out his ass. This dude really lost a lot bc of her. I wouldn't be surprised if he tries to sabotage your relationship with your gf next. Yk, telling you he saw her making out with other dudes or heard her talking bad about you to her friends or something. I would suggest that you tell him very clear that even IF your gf would move out, she really opened your eyes on some stuff and the times where you bailed him out are gone for good and will never come back, with ot w/o your gf living here.", "Do you think you might be the asshole in the story? Are you in doubt?"]}
