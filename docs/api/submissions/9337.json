We met in college and became really close ... or so I thought. Savannah I were opposites in many ways. She is very beautiful blonde woman, and really sweet and outgoing. I am pretty too but also awkward and confrontational.\n\nOne year ago, when I came back to our college state, she offered to come over to my apartment and help me unpack. It was then that she told me she was engaged to Eric (25F). I have always found Eric attractive, but didn't say anything. They had been dating for years, but things had just gotten real! I ignored my shattering heart and congratulated her while she showed off her ring and engagement photos. Some girls seem to have everything just handed to them, I thought. Savannah was one of them.\n\n\"And you will definitely be on the guest list!\" she told me. I had never been invited to wedding before (sad, I know), and I was excited! Even three months before the wedding, I bought a beautiful wedding guest dress from Michael Kors. This was gonna be FUN!\n\nSavannah has always been lively, outgoing, and popular, and her wedding was the major event of the town. All my friends were talking about it. I always had a good fashion sense, so other girls would ask me what I plan to wear to it. We all had a sleepover at Savannah's house and watched \"Bride Wars\", and she handed me a pink invitation for the Rehearsal Dinner. She showed everyone the wedding dress she chose, and looked gorgeous in it! I had never been more envious of someone.\n\nHowever, within a few weeks, I knew something was off. All my other friends had gotten wedding invitations in white envelopes, but I never did. I just had the pink rehearsal dinner card (which everyone else had also gotten) but not the wedding invitation. I was confused. Why would she just invite me to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding?\n\nThinking it might have been an oversight, or maybe the envelope got lost in the mail, I decided to talk to Savannah about it. I was wondering if she indeed just wanted me to come to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding.\n\nTurns out, she meant exactly that. **\"If a spot opens up at my wedding, I'll let you know!\"** I was really hurt, especially by the fact that she'd *told* me I'd be invited and asked me to save the date.\n\nA week before the wedding, I got a phone call. It was from Savannah. Sure enough, someone had gotten sick, and guess what? They had a spot for me now! She basically told me I am a Plan B!\n\nBecause dignity is important, I declined going to both the RD and the wedding. I congratulated her and wished both her and Eric the best in their marriage.\n\nMonths passed, and I hadn't heard from Savannah at all. Then she texted me out of the blue to tell me how fun married life is, and sent photos from their honeymoon.\n\nI just responded, **\"if a spot opens up in the list of people I'll ever speak to again, I'll let you know.\"**\n\nWas I too harsh?\n\nUPDATE: I do NOT mean to end the friendship, so that's why I am full of regret.", "created_utc": 1675743116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vs6f5/aita_for_telling_off_a_friend_who_lined_me_off/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm guessing since she said huh she didn't realize how awkward that is, why you denied it, why you wouldn't appreciate an update, or her going on about married life, etc. But this is what happens when people have main character syndrome, they never focus on other people's ideas of themselves, but only what they think of themselves.\n\nYou saying what you said obviously was an AH thing to say.

First of all, weddings do have tight guest lists.

Poor OP has no self awareness whatsoever.", "I'm also autistic and accustomed to not understanding a lot of social consensus. Sure enough, when I read your post I didn't recognize any of the negative social cues that people in this thread are identifying from it.\n\nBut having thought about the comments, and looked back at your original post, I think I understand what they mean so I'll try to explain the way I understand it:\n1) The friendship was much more imbalanced than you thought, likely in both type and intensity, and this dynamic was likely exacerbated by something that happened at the sleepover.\n2) The imbalanced dynamic, or at least its exacerbation at the sleepover, could have been avoided by consciously looking at and putting aside any jealousy or competitiveness you have with your friend.\n3) Since we are now in this position, that means you must not have put aside the jealousy or competitiveness.\n4) Now the friendship is over, and by continuing to devote this much energy to it you are posing an unacceptable emotional risk to someone who isn't even your friend.\n5) Until you can get some kind of working grasp on points 1-4, you're likely to continue posing an unacceptable emotional risk to other people, too.\n\nThe comments about being unhinged and so on are just various shorthand ways of expressing point 5. That's the best I can get from the comments I've read.\n\nSo it's not that there's any specific definition of \"unhinged\" that you need to learn, it's that people are mad at your behavior because it is a behavior that causes avoidable damage to other people.\n\nAn allistic person can let me know if I got that right. Either way, my advice would be to accept the friendship as null, because it wasn't what you imagined in the first place. Really try to forget about the wedding couple, because you should be spending that time focusing on your own life (which to be clear does not include the wedding couple). And if you want to be more considerate to other people, spend a long time thinking about how to give them more space or support, and how to recognize which is needed.\n\nETA: The \"spend a long time\" part isn't meant as a rebuke, that's just advice from my personal experience. I have to spend a long time thinking about my behaviors before I can start to see how they look in allistic frameworks. Sometimes it takes me years. It's OK, just do your best.", "You get comments like that because your behavior is unacceptable. Jesus Christ.", "Yeah I'm 34 and don't have crows feet or greys.
