We met in college and became really close ... or so I thought. Savannah I were opposites in many ways. She is very beautiful blonde woman, and really sweet and outgoing. I am pretty too but also awkward and confrontational.\n\nOne year ago, when I came back to our college state, she offered to come over to my apartment and help me unpack. It was then that she told me she was engaged to Eric (25F). I have always found Eric attractive, but didn't say anything. They had been dating for years, but things had just gotten real! I ignored my shattering heart and congratulated her while she showed off her ring and engagement photos. Some girls seem to have everything just handed to them, I thought. Savannah was one of them.\n\n\"And you will definitely be on the guest list!\" she told me. I had never been invited to wedding before (sad, I know), and I was excited! Even three months before the wedding, I bought a beautiful wedding guest dress from Michael Kors. This was gonna be FUN!\n\nSavannah has always been lively, outgoing, and popular, and her wedding was the major event of the town. All my friends were talking about it. I always had a good fashion sense, so other girls would ask me what I plan to wear to it. We all had a sleepover at Savannah's house and watched \"Bride Wars\", and she handed me a pink invitation for the Rehearsal Dinner. She showed everyone the wedding dress she chose, and looked gorgeous in it! I had never been more envious of someone.\n\nHowever, within a few weeks, I knew something was off. All my other friends had gotten wedding invitations in white envelopes, but I never did. I just had the pink rehearsal dinner card (which everyone else had also gotten) but not the wedding invitation. I was confused. Why would she just invite me to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding?\n\nThinking it might have been an oversight, or maybe the envelope got lost in the mail, I decided to talk to Savannah about it. I was wondering if she indeed just wanted me to come to the rehearsal dinner but not the wedding.\n\nTurns out, she meant exactly that. **\"If a spot opens up at my wedding, I'll let you know!\"** I was really hurt, especially by the fact that she'd *told* me I'd be invited and asked me to save the date.\n\nA week before the wedding, I got a phone call. It was from Savannah. Sure enough, someone had gotten sick, and guess what? They had a spot for me now! She basically told me I am a Plan B!\n\nBecause dignity is important, I declined going to both the RD and the wedding. I congratulated her and wished both her and Eric the best in their marriage.\n\nMonths passed, and I hadn't heard from Savannah at all. Then she texted me out of the blue to tell me how fun married life is, and sent photos from their honeymoon.\n\nI just responded, **\"if a spot opens up in the list of people I'll ever speak to again, I'll let you know.\"**\n\nWas I too harsh?\n\nUPDATE: I do NOT mean to end the friendship, so that's why I am full of regret.", "created_utc": 1675743116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vs6f5/aita_for_telling_off_a_friend_who_lined_me_off/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Savannah always intended to lead you to believe you were coming to the wedding only to leave you off the guest list at the last minute.

Savannah initially intended for you to come to the wedding, but *something* happened between your initial convo about the wedding & invitations going out that led her to reconsider and take this extremely passive aggressive step instead.

Yeah, in reality I've got the dark haired genes that seem to mean thick dark hair *everywhere* until your 80s.
