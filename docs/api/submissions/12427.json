He is so eager to isolate you that even crafting is unacceptable because by not focusing 100% on him, you are not only not dependent enough but also capable of accomplishing things on your own. This type of behaviour escalates. With my ex husband, this was one of the red flags that was a precursor to physical abuse.", "Would he be happier if you were watching him watching the show?

I demonstrated that I could do both of those things while crocheting and his response was they \u201cit just looks bad\u201d and I should quit. I would have seen his point more, except for the fact that I always talked to the trainer beforehand and asked if it would bother them or if they would prefer that I not do it, and every single one of them said it was not a problem, then proceeded to ask me detailed questions about my current project.

I can even follow movies with subtitles. Your bf is an AH for expecting that your hobbies revolve around him.", "NTA. I crochet and watch movies, shows, and listen to audiobooks. I can also do 2/3 of those things while talking to another person. I had a crochet business for a while, but my ex who hated it when he wasn\u2019t in control of my happiness or my business, sabotaged me and destroyed it.

I and other friends with ADHD have anecdotally found that knitting or crocheting somehow frees our minds to concentrate better on something like a movie, concert, or lecture. \n\nBut regardless of whether it helps or hinders your personal attention on the show, a bf doesn't have the right to control how you entertain yourself. If you want to be present while he enjoys a show and you enjoy a crochet, that's valid and he needs to get over it.

It's possible that you two are incompatible, but you're not wrong for crocheting while a show is on.", "NTA, but your bf is for calling you one for having a hobby, that\u2019s uncalled for, controlling and concerning.

I would say ESH because crochet demands a lot more attention and you're not watching the screen really, but your other half doesn't get to demand that you cannot do your own hobbies whilst doing something as low stakes as TV watching.", "NAH. After a long day, you both spend time as a couple. He wants to feel loved through watching a movie together. You understand his needs, and sit next to him while continuing to crochet, as this puts you in your comfort zone.\n\nHe is hurt that you are distracted and not prioritizing the relationship. This is ofc untrue: you\u2019re actually crocheting because you\u2019re comfortable, not bored.\n\nYou need communication. He needs to understand that you multitasking was not out of boredom, and you must describe his reactions as dramatic and hurtful. You two should share what hurt you the most in that moment, and set goals on improving his impulsive behavior.\n\nP.S. Ignore the reddit comments advising separation. Relationships are never perfect, and an honest misunderstanding (if not recurring,) should not end with a life changing decision.", "NAH. I\u2019ve seen this question asked many times over the years. The disconnect here between people who crochet and those that don\u2019t is that you can tune out your hand motions. It\u2019s so routine to you that you sort of zen out and don\u2019t have to pay active attention to what your hands are doing. I\u2019ve even heard people say it\u2019s like a fidget toy and they actually concentrate better.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. Non crotchet people can\u2019t tune it out. It\u2019s super distracting; the motion, the click click click noises, the occasional check of the stitch. All of it. And if it\u2019s distracting to the person *not* doing it, the logical thought in their head is that you are not giving full attention to the thing you are doing together. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the compromise is.
