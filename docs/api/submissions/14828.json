He said he'd only use the car to go there and back, then \"tried\" to call you about how JK he was going to spend another 90+ minutes with your car doing what he wanted--but that call didn't go through so you found out at the end of his shenanigans rather than the beginning.\n\nHe's proven he can't be trusted to keep his word. No more car borrowing for him. In short, he fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Do not let him gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re wrong.", "NTA this is the type of thing I call a values problem. Values problems almost always lead to break ups because the unmitigated selfish behavior is not really conducive to a happy relationship.", "NTA. He took advantage of your kindness. He\u2019s more than welcome to use public transit or even better if he wants to drive around he can look into buying his own beater car on his dime.", "NTA. He probably didn\u2019t even call because you wouldn\u2019t agree:", "NTA he made a promise, he broke the promise.\nThere are repercussions to that. I'd ban him from using the car until he stops having tantrums. Toddlers shouldn't be driving!", "NTA. He can call an Uber.", "NTA - frankly he doesn't respect you at all.  furthermore i couldn't tell if you were his GF or mother.  what he did is what i'd expect a 16yo to do with their parent's car.\n\ni know today's generation has zero use for honesty.  but frankly if my SO lied to me as casually as he just lied to you then she wouldn't be my SO anymore.  you have to have zero respect for someone to treat them like that.", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be yelled at and no one is entitled to use your property.", "NTA. How in any way are you the jerk when you did him a favour, he took advantage of that and then some, to seriously inconvenience you.  He can be mad all he wants\u2026. And even get his own wheels. To take it out on you is completely uncalled for.", "NTA. You trusted the BF to undertake his errands with the conditions set, and he broke that by failing to comply with them.\n\nHe is very much TA on this for a) breaking said conditions, b) yelling at you because he can't be trusted, and c) causing added stress and issues for you at a later point. I'd even question their position as your BF if they're going to not going to be civil and understanding on such issues, too.", "NTA. He abused the favor you granted him by keeping the car longer than you said (and doing more than just go to the doctor with it). The consequences are all on him.

Nothing good ever comes from a relationship where only one person in it is responsible and productive. End it before it gets worse\u2026 and it will.", "NTA. He fucked up and has the audacity to throw a tantrum? He needs to go back to his mommy because there is no way he is mature enough to live on his own.", "NTA. This is the type of person who asks forgiveness rather than permission. Another commentor said it first, but when someone shows you themselves, take it at face value.

Let\u2019s say that you were mad at him for this, and it was unjustified. (You are completely justified in reality; this is a hypothetical scenario.) You guys argue, and he stomps off to his room. Then, sitting alone in his room, he periodically experiences emotionally surges so powerful that he can\u2019t get on top of them, and \u2014 again, I remind you, he is alone and you didn\u2019t do anything new to prompt this \u2014 YELLS more of his thoughts at you.\n\nThis is unhinged behaviour.
