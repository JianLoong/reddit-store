Listen.\n\nHe is a person who will yell at you when he violates your trust and negatively effects your life.", "Don\u2019t let his tantrum make you second guess yourself. NTA.", "NTA He needs to grow up and figure out his own issues instead of yelling at you for not letting him continue to take advantage of you and your generosity.", "NTA. He said he'd only use the car to go there and back, then \"tried\" to call you about how JK he was going to spend another 90+ minutes with your car doing what he wanted--but that call didn't go through so you found out at the end of his shenanigans rather than the beginning.\n\nHe's proven he can't be trusted to keep his word. No more car borrowing for him. In short, he fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Do not let him gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re wrong.", "NTA this is the type of thing I call a values problem. Values problems almost always lead to break ups because the unmitigated selfish behavior is not really conducive to a happy relationship.", "NTA. He took advantage of your kindness. He\u2019s more than welcome to use public transit or even better if he wants to drive around he can look into buying his own beater car on his dime.", "NTA. He probably didn\u2019t even call because you wouldn\u2019t agree:", "NTA he made a promise, he broke the promise.\nThere are repercussions to that. I'd ban him from using the car until he stops having tantrums. Toddlers shouldn't be driving!", "NTA. He can call an Uber.", "NTA - frankly he doesn't respect you at all.  furthermore i couldn't tell if you were his GF or mother.  what he did is what i'd expect a 16yo to do with their parent's car.\n\ni know today's generation has zero use for honesty.  but frankly if my SO lied to me as casually as he just lied to you then she wouldn't be my SO anymore.  you have to have zero respect for someone to treat them like that.", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be yelled at and no one is entitled to use your property.", "NTA. How in any way are you the jerk when you did him a favour, he took advantage of that and then some, to seriously inconvenience you.  He can be mad all he wants\u2026. And even get his own wheels. To take it out on you is completely uncalled for.", "NTA. You trusted the BF to undertake his errands with the conditions set, and he broke that by failing to comply with them.\n\nHe is very much TA on this for a) breaking said conditions, b) yelling at you because he can't be trusted, and c) causing added stress and issues for you at a later point. I'd even question their position as your BF if they're going to not going to be civil and understanding on such issues, too.", "NTA. He abused the favor you granted him by keeping the car longer than you said (and doing more than just go to the doctor with it). The consequences are all on him. He has zero right to be angry (even if he hadn't done that, it's YOUR car to make decisions about)!", "NTA, and you really shouldn\u2019t let anyone who isn\u2019t on your insurance take your car without you, especially, not when you\u2019re nervous about him being an inexperienced driver. Do you really want to be on the hook for any damages he causes to your vehicle without your knowing?\n\nFurthermore, is your car. He\u2019s not obligated to use it just because he\u2019s dating you. What you should be obligating him to do is treat you, your time, and your property with respect. Do you really want to be with someone who knowingly and deliberately leaves you in the lurch and then has trouble taking no for an answer?", "NTA. You two should break up. Nothing good ever comes from a relationship where only one person in it is responsible and productive. End it before it gets worse\u2026 and it will.", "NTA. He fucked up and has the audacity to throw a tantrum? He needs to go back to his mommy because there is no way he is mature enough to live on his own.", "NTA. This is the type of person who asks forgiveness rather than permission. Another commentor said it first, but when someone shows you themselves, take it at face value. And personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who yells at me when they\u2019re in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou were clear about how you wanted him to use the car, and he did his own thing anyway. If he tried to call and the call didn\u2019t go through, that was his cue to do only what had been agreed, not something else entirely.\n\nYou\u2019re not the AH. He is.
