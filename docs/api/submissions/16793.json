And you need to accept it, have a good wedding and a wonderful life with your new husband.", "NTA. If your mom wants you to wear her dress, then wear it. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s about the dress, it\u2019s about you getting to have something special first.", "  \nNo, you are not the asshole for accepting your mum's wedding dress. Your mum gave you the dress for specific reasons, and it is ultimately her decision who to pass it down to. The fact that you have shown interest in the dress, are mum's size, and plan on having kids in the future all make sense as reasons why she would choose to pass it down to you.  \nIt's understandable that your sister 21f might feel left out or upset, but it's important to remember that this is not a contest and your mum's decision to give you the dress does not diminish your sister's value or importance in the family. It's important to communicate with her and try to understand her feelings, but ultimately the decision is your mum's to make.  \nIt's unfortunate that this has caused drama within the family, but hopefully, they can come to understand your mum's decision and move past this issue.", "NTA - it was your moms dress to give away as she desired.

This isn't an issue between the two of you but between her and her mom. Happy nuptials!", "Nta she can have it after your wedding if she chooses to get married in the future, there\u2019s more to her jealousy than this, I think it\u2019s a beautiful gesture that your mum is being so supportive of your transitioning that she gave you the dress because she sees you as her daughter, she\u2019s completely accepted you and supports your decisions 100% I think that\u2019s what your sister is jealous of, she doesn\u2019t see you as her sister yet and that is her disgusting problem and not yours. Don\u2019t feel bad, your mum did the right thing and I bet the dress is gorgeous and I bet you\u2019ll look gorgeous in it!

If she wanted to use it in the future i wouldnt be opposed but i dont think it will fit her or if it can be tailored to her hight.", "I agree about the sister's comment. It was extremely hostile and intended to be hurtful. That's not something you say by accident. It sounds like she wanted to try to remind OP that she's not a \"real\" woman so she doesn't deserve it. Obviously, that's not true. I'm not sure what the sister is trying to do here other than completely ruin their relationship.", "\"I want it even though I might never use it because I'm a woman and you aren't\", vile", "Yeah, it wasnt promised to anyone. We dont really have family heirlooms that get promised to people like that.", "I guess 21f ment that shes the eldest from our mum, since our sister 23f is technicly our step sister.", "Yeah im glad to have them. Though mum has always been supportive of everything i do, helps that im a mini version of her.", "I dont know why she wants it either. I dont think she could wear it even of she wanted my sisters a considerably taller than me and my mum.", "Even if 21f were to get married im not even sure she would wear a dress. She hasnt worn one since she was 12 and is a huge tomboy. Shes more likely to wear a suit if anything, which makes the eldest daughter tranphobic comments more hurtful and confusing.", "Thanks so much \u2764\ufe0f. Tbf i think my mum knew very very early lol. Ive always been a mini version of her and she was a girly girl while my sister (21f) is a huge tomboy so i think theres some jelousy there with how close and similar me and mum are.", "Your mom did give her dress to her eldest daughter. Duh. Your sister owes you one hell of an apology. NTA and congrats on your big day!", "I can\u2019t see why it\u2019s a problem it went to the first married child", "That makes your younger sister even more of an asshole, since she has had your step-sister in her life since she was literally 4 years old, yet she is still placing blood boundaries where obviously rest of your family isn't. It's your mom's call and she chose you. Don't feel bad about it ONE BIT.

First of all, you're getting married.  No one else is.  The one sister doesn't even know if she ever wants to get married.  It only makes sense that the dress goes to you.  If sis decides to get married, you can pass the dress along to her.   And why are other family members getting involved?  It's none of their business.", "NTA: your sister isn't getting married, you are.

I\u2019ll go buy another very similar dress instead\u201d\n\nLast time I checked there were no rules about needing to be cis to wear family items. This just seems like a transphobic tantrum that your mom accepts you as a daughter tbh.

YOU.  It is her dress to give to whoever she chooses.", "NTA, it's your mom's dress to give away, she gets to decide who it goes to. Congratulations on your engagement!", "I'm so sorry you had to hear your sister say that. It's totally unfair to you. I think your sister using it in the future is a great compromise. I mean, it's not brand new, it's your Mum's. Why does it matter if you get to wear it first? Does that mean it's not your Mum's dress any longer? \n\nBesides, you need something \"borrowed\" for your big day anyway \ud83d\ude09 \u2764\ufe0f", "Wear it with pride and love, have it dry-cleaned and stored, & if the wee twit actually grows up, the \u2018family heirloom\u2019 can be used again?", "NTA. Every other good reason aside, I can't see the point of giving a wedding dress to someone who doesn't want to get married. If this is maybe about feeling left out (she acted horribly though) you could I guess suggest maybe something else sentimental getting passed on as an option or try to discuss it, but that's only if you want to try to sort it. I don't think you have to."]}
