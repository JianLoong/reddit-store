OR he needs to look into ways to manage his daughter\u2019s allergies since they\u2019re *so* severe (that\u2019s the responsible thing to do). NTA", "NTA - I'd sooner ditch a boy/girl/theyfriend than my boy \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc36", "NTA for wanting to keep the cat, but I also don't blame your BF for trying to protect his kid. Per the other comments maybe look into some way that you can help manage the symtoms of allergy, or work out a way that you can have someone cat sit while the daughter is visiting (alongside with trying to decontaminate the place, which as a cat owner I know is easier said than done).", "When she comes to visit have an air purifier going. That seems to help my visitors who have cat allergies", "There is a food made by Purina that blocks the allergen in pet fur.  Purina Live Clear cat food.  Check it out.  I\u2019m a veterinarian, have cats, and am allergic to cats. This and Zyrtec daily works for me.", "NTA there's people living full time with cats who take allergie meds to deal with it. So I'm sure if the kid reacts to your cats, she can take allergy meds when she visits.\nDoes he visit her often? 3 times in 2 years is sad. Did he get rid of his family as easily as he wants you to give up your families cat?", "NTA. It's your cat! You can't get rid of it.", "NTA. Possible solution: there is a cat food that seriously lessens pet dander, you could get a bag and use it in the weeks before she comes. My stepmom who is severely allergic uses it and she is able to live full time with my dad\u2019s cat. Sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this!", "NTA she may have been allergic to something used on the cat. My nephew wound up in the ER twice with severe allergic reactions when he was 5 or 6. Doctors did allergy panels and basically said he was allergic to everything including most meats, eggs, dairy, dogs, cats, trees, grass etc.  I told my sister there was no way they are right and we started pinpointing what happened before each reaction. Both times he had been to his grandma house playing with the dogs. Called up grandma and after a bit of a chat we realized she had given them a flea dip bath before he came over both times. Case solved, he was allergic to the flea bath she was using. She ditched it and he's never had a reaction since, even though we didn't change anything else in his daily life or diet.", "NTA", "You're NTA for wanting to keep your cat when the person allergic to it almost never visits, but you should be aware that people can spontaneously develop allergies to things that have never bothered them in the past. Just something to keep in mind, so maybe you can have some OTC allergy medicine on hand for when she visits.", "NTA. Your BF only sees her a couple times a year. Get a hotel room!", "NTA. The cat has been there before your boyfriend\u2019s daughter entered your life. It\u2019s a member of your family and getting rid of it is not fair to the animal! It seems a little weird that your boyfriend\u2019s ex is claiming she has a severe cat allergy when the daughter hasn\u2019t shown any problems at your house.", "NTA, but your future ex-BF sure is.", "NTA but if no one has seen this severe allergic reaction I would be wondering if it even existed and how was it something JUST found out about?", "NTA This seems like a late onset of severe allergies, so talk to the bf and ask if it's the saliva or dander. For dander, you'll just need to keep the cat away from your partner's daughter. If it's saliva, she can be around the cat but must wash her hands after contact.", "NTA for not wanting to get rid of the cat, but don't be so quick to dismiss the allergy. Allergies are notorious for popping up after previous exposures so it's entirely possible that she really did have a severe reaction.\n\nBut before you consider getting rid of the cat for an occasional resident, I would consider absolutely everything else. Like, how sure are they that it was the cat and not, say, the cat's shampoo, flea meds, or litter? Exactly what is severe? If she went to a doctor and not a hospital, is this something that could be treated with meds while she visits? Could the entire family relocate to a rental without the cat for the daughter's visits?", "She may have developed a allergy....it's easy to. Since this is his daughter I think you should keep the cat HOWEVER the cat will need to leave the home and stay with a friend or pet hotel/boarded while she is there. And deep clean the home. It's a fair compromise.", "Info Why does his daughter visit so infrequently? Does he see his daughter outside of your home? Is the ex using the cat as control thing over the daughter not visiting again?", "NTA, ask for proof.  While it's possible that an allergy developed, it could be his ex messing with you.  If there is proof, I would follow the recommendations of the people on this thread - change food, deep clean the house before she comes, brush as much as possible, give the cat a bath, and consider limiting the cat to one room during her stay.", "NTA\n\nThere is medicine she can take and other ways to prevent an allergic reaction.", "NTA\n\nYour BF suggestion is awful, considering his daughter lives with her mother \"nearly full time\". For her visits - maybe you can find a trusted pet sitter or friend who will be willing to take care of the cat for a few days? And clean a house? It should be enough. If she has \"a severe allergy\" she will need medication anyway, since many people have cats.", "NTA. Not sure what she's allergic to, but if she played with your cat with no problems, then she not allergic to it. Even if she were, you could theoretically board the cat for the fews days she visits.", "Agree. We had cats for years growing up, and at some point, my sister became allergic. After years. Shit happens.", "Strue. If its a white cat or long haired cat the mom might have an issue with all the hair she takes home - especially seeing as she plays with him...\n\nNTA definitely\n\nA possible solution if it isn't a bullshit excuse* is to keep one room 'safe' where cat can't go during the time the kiddo is there\n\n-*I also recently became allergic to cats, but I solve it by keeping a mask on when I meet one (some cats are worse than others, tickly throat business that sticks around for hours despite antihistamines...it's more annoying than threatening, for me)", "Also, wash her clothes and the linens for the room that she is staying in regularly when she visits, put a humidifier and an air filter in her room, and have her wash her hands (or the effected area) immediately if the cat licks her when she's there. \n\n(I am allergic to cats and I have two because with a little diligence this can be managed, \\*depending on what they mean by a 'severe' reaction ... if she's gone into anaphylaxis then it's worthwhile talking about other options, like renting a vacation house for the 1-2 visits a year instead of having her in your home with your cat.)"]}
