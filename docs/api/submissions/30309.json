That seems to help my visitors who have cat allergies", "There is a food made by Purina that blocks the allergen in pet fur.  Purina Live Clear cat food.  Check it out.

Doctors did allergy panels and basically said he was allergic to everything including most meats, eggs, dairy, dogs, cats, trees, grass etc.  I told my sister there was no way they are right and we started pinpointing what happened before each reaction. Both times he had been to his grandma house playing with the dogs. Called up grandma and after a bit of a chat we realized she had given them a flea dip bath before he came over both times. Case solved, he was allergic to the flea bath she was using. She ditched it and he's never had a reaction since, even though we didn't change anything else in his daily life or diet.", "NTA", "You're NTA for wanting to keep your cat when the person allergic to it almost never visits, but you should be aware that people can spontaneously develop allergies to things that have never bothered them in the past.

Allergies are notorious for popping up after previous exposures so it's entirely possible that she really did have a severe reaction.\n\nBut before you consider getting rid of the cat for an occasional resident, I would consider absolutely everything else. Like, how sure are they that it was the cat and not, say, the cat's shampoo, flea meds, or litter? Exactly what is severe? If she went to a doctor and not a hospital, is this something that could be treated with meds while she visits? Could the entire family relocate to a rental without the cat for the daughter's visits?", "She may have developed a allergy....it's easy to.

For her visits - maybe you can find a trusted pet sitter or friend who will be willing to take care of the cat for a few days? And clean a house? It should be enough. If she has \"a severe allergy\" she will need medication anyway, since many people have cats.", "NTA.

It's just possible that her mother exaggerated the incident so she has an excuse to prevent further visits. \n\nI wouldn't get rid of the cat.

And given how seldom she is there, I can't picture a scenario where you can't work around this. \n\nBut the other adults aren't AH for wanting to immediately take action to protect the health of their child. They just need to take a step back and get more info. \n\nIt is 100% ok if they don't want to risk her being around the cat at all.

So for the couple of times the deadbeat dad sees the daughter he can bugger off to a hotel.", "NTA - Pets aren't disposable, and that sounds like bitter ex nonsense. His daughter might actually be allergic, but you'd see the result of that almost immediately when she was still in your home if it were YOUR cat doing it. Some cats cause bigger allergic reactions than others. At one point, I had four cats, and only one of them caused a significant allergic reaction for my extremely allergic father. The rest were easily managed with an allergy pill. The cat is a family member. You don't throw away family members for just existing.", "NTA - you have a responsibility to the cat. Allergies can pop up with no real warning but there are ways to manage allergies without getting rid of the cat, especially if the kid isn\u2019t around the house much.

If this allergy is real and is severe it would be neglect on the mom's part not to get her treatment. Cat dander can't be avoided. She needs medical treatment. You can tell it us bullshit if the mom doesn't follow up with treatment", "NTA. I feel like the mother is jumping to an extreme. She needs to get her daughter allergy tested. As a lot of people are saying, sometimes people can be allergic to something that is on the cat and not the cat itself. For example, she could be allergic to the type of kitty litter that cat was using. So this allergy needs to be figured out for certain,  not just because of your cat but because of the potential for her to be exposed somewhere else to the allergen. \n\nEven if she is allergic I feel that some sort of compromise can be made considering she is so seldom at your house. For example,  maybe the cat can stay with family or a cat sitter for the times that the daughter is at your house.", "Do NOT get rid of your cat!!!

People do have previous exposure and develop an allergy later in life. There is no reason not to believe this medical update. \n\nHow severe was the reaction? ER trip? Weird rash they checked out? How is her allergy being treated? Does she do ok with allergy meds or do they have no effect?\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge that cat hair and dander is extremely difficult to clean and minimize when a cat is in the home. It will be hard to limit allergens when she does come and you\u2019ll need an effective strategy to mitigate her allergies. \n\nShe is his daughter. She does come before the family pet. Days under the roof don\u2019t change the prioritization of the relationships", "While your use of \"quotation marks\" in this post is definitely assholish, not wanting to get rid of a beloved pet for an occasional visitor is not.", "NTA. Ask him to leave but I'm curious why you decided to date and move in a dude that only sees his kid once or twice a year when you have kids.", "After I remarried, I gave my cat away because a son-in-law is very allergic to cats. They tried a visit where we had gotten the entire house and floors professionally cleaned, and added an air filter. He still reacted with bad respiratory symptoms, leading up to pneumonia. So, thereafter, if we ever wanted the grandchildren to visit, we had to rehome my cat. They made this clear, so I chose my husband\u2019s daughter and family over the cat.\n\nWell, since rehoming my cat, they have visited exactly ONCE in six years.\ud83d\ude15 We go to their house, one state away, for various reasons, 2-3 times a year. I try not to resent giving up my cat for nothing.\n\nIf your SO\u2019s daughter\u2019s allergy isn\u2019t severe, it\u2019s worth a try to have her take antihistamines, and not play with the cat. Be ready to bail on that plan, and dad can take her to a hotel or airbnb for the rest of that visit.\n\nIf your SO\u2019s daughter\u2019s allergy is severe, you can all meet up together in an airbnb when he has his time with her, or go out for a day of activities if the visits aren\u2019t overnight. Perhaps holidays can be at a relatives house.\n\nImho, since this cat belongs to your two children, and SO\u2019s daughter is with him only a short amount of the year, a variety of other measures should be tried before giving up your cat.", "Reddit is big on prioritizing pets over people. I love pets, too. My tiny dog is sitting on my lap right now. But here's the deal. CHILDREN are more important than pets. That means your kids AND boyfriend's daughter. The fact that she only visits twice a year does not mean that her needs are unimportant. Your boyfriend is her DAD. \n\nI visited my dad 3x a year from age 7, because my parents lived in different states and plane tickets are expensive.  Plus, it was the 1970s, and visitation/custody arrangements back then highly favored the mother. \n\nBut my dad's house was still my second home. We had our own routines, our own traditions, when my sister and I were there. If I had been treated like a visitor of little importance by a new family, that would have been devastating to me. (He did remarry, but she had no kids and was a loving stepmother.)\n\nThat's why I don't like the hotel or AirB&B idea. It makes sense from an allergy point of view. My husband is also allergic to cats, and it is really hard to contain the dander. But this girl deserves to visit her father in his home.\n\nOn the other hand, your kids deserve to keep their pet. It's quite a dilemma. Hopefully you can work with the child's mother and doctor to find a solution, as others have suggested.\n\nBut please remember that this child is more than an inconvenience to your family. Maybe you could even encourage your boyfriend to have her visit more often, if possible. \n\nYTA, not for wanting to keep your cat, but for your apparent attitude toward this child and being so skeptical of her allergy", "Allergies can develop, worsen, and decrease over time so even if she hasn't been allergic before doesn't mean she isn't now.

But\u2026 you would see signs of this while she is with you.  Look online for information on how to manage Cat allergy/sensitivity in your home.  It is pretty common.  \n\nMy guess is you would need to talk to her mom about taking a histamine, but if she won\u2019t allow that- there are a lot of other options.

That is in fact how allergies work - they are your immune system going into overdrive over previously-identified genetic material.

So that is the question to ask - how was the allergy identified?\n\nUnfortunately, temporarily rehoming your cat while the daughter visits is not a solution as the cat will shed skin flakes onto floor coverings and furnishings, and she will still be exposed to the genetic material through skin contact or airborne particulate exposure. \n\nIf you value your boyfriend I would seriously consider permanently re-homing your pet and doing a deep clean so that it doesn't become a wedge in his relationship with her, and ultimately with you.

Vinegar breaks down allergen proteins so they can be washed away. Just washing items with detergent doesn't remove allergens. You might also get an ozone machine, run it when nobody is in the room. Try and make the room she sleeps in as allergen free as possible, so she had a place to escape to if she has an attack while at your home. \n\nAllergies are no joke, I was bed bound for a year due to allergies, and diagnosed with a lung disease from it.
