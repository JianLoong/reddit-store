We lived in Europe for most of our lives before that, going between the UK, the Netherlands, and Iceland ever since ED and dad got divorced, and he made her sign away her parental rights. We moved back to the states about a year ago, and ED wanted to see us again, and introduce us to the new family she funded with Dad's money. I didn't really care-- I have a mom, even if she isn't biologically mine-- but my sister \"Tory\" wanted to have a relationship with her really bad. \n\nDad basically said it was fine for them to start meeting each other, but it had to be at our house to start with, and he wanted ED to visit once a month for a year before we would meet her husband. The meetings were always awkward, and ED would usually cry and try and guilt me for not wanting to call her all the time while we were growing up, and try to make us call her \"mom.\" I get along pretty well with one of her kids, though, so I kept agreeing to meet up, but after a few months, when she started offering to take us out places alone, I said no. Tory said yes. \n\nAfter that, Tory started acting really, really weird. She started talking about how we're entitled, and spoiled, and basically started insulting everything to do with the way Mom and Dad raised us. She seemed really depressed, and I caught her crying a bunch of times. I got worried, so about a week ago, I read her diary and found out that she's actually already met ED's husband, even though Dad specifically said she would have to keep up visits for a year. If it were a recent thing, that's one thing, since it's been like ten months, but apparently, she met him for the first time all the way back in October. \n\nAnyway, I told Dad what was going on, and now he's saying that ED doesn't respect boundaries, and he's mad at Tory for keeping secrets. He doesn't want her going out alone with ED anymore, and has basically said that either he or Mom is going to be attending these outings with her until he can trust ED again. Tory's pissed that I told, and says that it's messed up that Dad basically forced ED to give us up. He did, but I don't really think that's a bad thing. I love my family, and I do not want to let ED tear my sister away from us. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR: My sister met our egg donor's husband behind Dad's back, and I told him what was going on.

I am reading this for a long time, i now know that you like responses with an explanation. \n\nLook, I agree with you at some point, I would like my children to grow up in the best possible environment, ect, as I can give them. \n\nHowever, just as much as a child from underprivileged environments, or families will never understand what you have and how amazing it is to expierience things you do, you will not understand the other side of the coin.\n\nSomewhat I have experienced both, and I can tell you that your mother, has been a victim of your father. He seeked the attention of a waitress from a different world to his and accepted her clearly for reasons other than love. He seems like the one with a plan, and your mom got lost in this. She has the best of your interest at heart because if she hasn't, she would get on with his agenda to live in luxury that he provided. After she stood up for her parenting values he wanted and did destroy her, because he saw her as an obstacle. He never wanted a partner.\n\nIt will take you years to realise that poverty comes in many shapes, and your father impoverished you by cutting off your mother who otherwise would provide experiences that are extremely valuable. I have, at some point of my life, out of stubbornness, lived on a few pounds a week, and I have learnt something so incredibly valuable that you will never understand. I am not saying you had to go through that or anything, but your mom could have provided the insights to fighting for what you need and not DEMANDING it, as you clearly are now. \n\nI am all very much about self reliance, I admire business oriented people, and I love luxuries. However, I can get those things all by myself now. Can you honestly say that if all your fathers money goes away, you will be able to fight? Will you ever be able to get some shitty job to go by to finish school, etc? Will you be able to survive?\n\nAfter all your replies, I can see that you are very immature, disrespectful, and closed-minded. \n\nYour mom saw the lack of preparedness and sheltering that your father was ready to enclose you in, and she wanted to broaden your horizons. Just in the same way as your dad did with private schooling, etc. They both wanted best.\n\nWhat is shocking to me is that your father denies you therapy because someone said there might be something \"wrong\" with you. There is something wrong with everyone. And faster you will accept that no amount of nice clothes and cars, as you put it, will not make you perfect, you will be better off and more humble.", "YTA\n\nFor reading her diary instead of trying to talk to her first and then going to your father instead of trying to talk to her. \n\nI think you will find in time your dad is probably a rich narcissist. He made your mom sign her rights away? That\u2019s ok with you? Have you even heard or listen to her side or?????", "You and your dad are both the AH. YTA. \nI don\u2019t know how old your bio mom was when she had to sign that weird prenup. It\u2019s very likely she was young and naive, and was taken advantage of by your AH dad. Nowhere in the world is such a prenup fair or normal.", "YTA for reading your sister's diary alone. Your sister is 16 and is just realizing how fucked up it is that her bio mom was forced to give her up. I'd be pretty pissed too! She's old enough to make her own choices about her relationship with her family, you don't need to snoop around and violate her privacy because she doesn't agree with you that the father that essentially stole her is a saint.\n\nAlso, your sister and bio mom are right. In a comment you say your mom wanted to do 'messed up things to you' and then elaborated that those things were 'attending public school' and 'wearing synthetic fabric'. You ARE spoiled and privileged. And the whole line about how your dad got a diagnosed mental illness erased from your record but that's fine because he told you therapists misdiagnose people to make money and that you're a 'good person' so there's nothing wrong with you . . . well, I hope this post is fake, that's all.", "ESH. Someday you are going to realize how controlling and abusive your father is.", "ESH. You for reading your sister's diary. Your dad for being an abusive and controlling creep (to use your word). He took advantage of someone in order to have children. And continues to use his power and privilege in negative ways. I mean you have a diagnosed mental illness that he used money and power to erase from your record because he didn't like it. He alienated you and your sister from your biological mother because he didn't want you to have boundaries or discipline. He doesn't let you talk to \"strangers\" which as older teens you should be able to decide somewhat for yourself.\n\nYour sister seems to be the smart one here. She is noticing all of the problems with your father and is rebelling against them. She is considering just how awful the story of your parents breaking up is and how wrong he was to use his money to get his way.", "ESH\n\nYou for being closed off from the beginning about your bio-mother's side, reading your sister's diary, and leading your biological mother on just to hang out with your half-sibling. Just cut off contact with her. \n\nYour dad for taking advantage of someone of a different class than him. The prenup said no money, her custody or lots of money, his custody? Are you serious? Raising two children with a waitress salary and you haven't noted if she continued education or changed jobs. Does she have any family members besides her own children? What was the difference in parenting he had so much trouble with? She did you a favor by going the other way, sorry. Kids are expensive. \n\nAlso, he knows the husband but still doesn't want them to get to know each other until 12 MONTHLY visits with bio-mom? This whole arrangement is beyond weird but it is clearly helped by your father's money. \n\nYour bio-mom for going against rules, but your father would probably still have them even if you two were legal adults. \n\nYour sister's now legally allowed to switch parents now though. That's her right and I hope she takes it to get to know someone she's missed, whether good or bad.\n\nEdit: Verdict the same, more info\n\nSeems that OP is more concerned with Tory not doing college and dropping out of extracurriculars rather than her own feelings. College isn't the end-all-be-all and could be done later. \n\nAlong with that OP continues to be elitist and presents no growth or understanding.\n\nAn allergy to synthetic material does not make it bad for everyone and many department stores make their clothes naturally. I also have a sensitivity, but watch what I buy.\n\nNegative and objective usage of words towards bio-mom. Never mentions how Tory sees OP's mom, but assumes she sees her as such and not as a step-mom, especially as Tory most likely remembers her mom more.\n\nThe one Tory needs to talk to is her mother. One visit isn't enough for this poor girl who needs her mom.", "There are so many more things wrong with this than you telling on your sister. Esh everyone in this story is toxic", "Op I know you\u2019re a child, but Jesus Christ you need to use your brain. You\u2019re arguing and you\u2019re digging you and your father into a deeper hole. Your father is a raging ah and it seems like you are headed that way too. Respect your sister, her privacy and her right to be with her bio mom.", "You just ensured that when, not if, but when your sister leaves she will never speak to you again. And honestly, I'm glad for her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nReading your comments just confirms that you are ah. You are brainwashed. Your sister is going to cut you out of her life as soon as she can. Then I hope her true mother and husband adopt her. \n1. You are an elitist. Get over yourself. \n2. Your dad is abusive. And he DID abuse you. It is called parental alienation.\n3. You will never get your sister back because you are so brainwashed that you can't see that you are hurting her.\n\n\nSo, how is your dad going to destroy your sister for not being a brainless follower? Are you going to help?", "YTA for reading the diary and snitching. \n\nBut you also can\u2019t see what most others here can, you HAVE been severely abused and brainwashed by someone with significant power.  But you\u2019re currently in too deep to see it.  But hopefully the comments here help plant a seed of thought to view the situation from a different vantage point.   Whenever you want to react defensively, ask yourself \u2018is this my thoughts and my words, or is this what I\u2019ve always been told and my father\u2019s words?\u2019.\n\nYour father has denied you a relationship with your mother.  He\u2019s alienated you from her - which is a form of abuse- by both using his financial power to force her to walk away, and demeaning her to you - all evidenced by your use of the term of \u2018egg donor\u2019 and your derision of her financial and employment status.  I bet he wasn\u2019t expecting her to walk away, either.  He learned in that action he didn\u2019t have the control over her he thought, so he doubled down on you and your sister.  \n\nHe has prevented you from having a relationship with your mother.  \n\nYou have been denied a relationship with your mother. \n\nYour father is also controlling you by not letting you obtain therapy and support for the diagnosis.  Think deeply\u2026 strip away the story\u2026 Why doesn\u2019t he like therapists?  \n\nbecause that\u2019s an outside voice he can\u2019t control, a voice that may help you understand what\u2019s really happening to you and help you get out.\n\nHave you considered this viewpoint as to WHY your sister is sad?  I bet she\u2019s realised what\u2019s been denied from her - a relationship which her mother.  She\u2019s probably learning what parts of her come from your mother.  She\u2019s also probably more like your mother, and you more like your father.\n\n\nYour sister\u2019s probably realising that you\u2019re both birds locked in one hell of a golden cage.  You\u2019re very well provided for, but there\u2019s no intention to ever release you from that cage.  Your father has permitted the contact with your mother because he was confident even with the door open, you wouldn\u2019t leave the cage.  Sister was starting to spread her wings, so he\u2019s slammed the cage shut again.\n\nI gather you\u2019re homeschooled from one of your comments - yet another strategy to keep control of the narrative and your world view.  Homeschooling isn\u2019t a bad thing per se; but what co-ops have you been part of?  what extra curricular activities have you done?  Team sport, arts, music, theatre etc that has you interacting with lots of different errs and families?  You sound like you\u2019ve had very limited exposure to alternative world views.  You sound like you\u2019ve been raised in a very limited echo chamber.  FWIW - Be prepared for excuses on why you can\u2019t go to college when the time comes, or the conditions put on it/on how he\u2019ll pay for it.\n\nAnd watch your father\u2019s reaction when he finds out you\u2019ve posted here.  I bet he\u2019ll say We dint know anything, we\u2019ll all be lying; we\u2019ll all be jealous of you and the lifestyle your father\u2019s money brings you. You may find tech and social media access shut down for a while. That all too is to control the narrative and limit your viewpoint to his and his only so you\u2019ll do exactly as you\u2019re told. \n\nMany have said here that you\u2019re a selfish brat\u2026 that\u2019s exactly what he wants you to be, because no one will want anything to do with you with that behaviour, and you\u2019re back to the beginning- stuck in your golden cage/ echo Chamber, with just your father liking you.", "YTA", "YTA, ED isn't tearing your sister away. You are pushing her away.", "OK, this isn't the point but I have to say it. Unless your bio mom is actually just a egg donor, don't use the term to describe your bio mom who just left. There are actual egg donors that you are giving a bad name to. Just call her bio mom", "If you're worried about your sister, then TALK to her, dont read her diary behind her back. I'd never forgive someone who did that to me. For that alone, YTA", "Yeah YTA, and your dad is the biggest AH. Sounds like he threatened your mom to give you up no matter what, and her only concern was you guys being spoiled. From the comments it sounds like her worst fears came true, so that's unfortunate. You need to apologize to your sister and let her live her own life. She's just going to hate you and your dad forever if you force anything else.", "Yta. You violated your sisters privacy by reading her journal and then running to daddy. If your dad had concerns thats his prerogative but you are not your sisters parent. Short of a child endangerment issue,  which you haven't indicated, your sister has every right to have a relationship with her mom. You stated your dad \"made her sign her parental rights away.\" I imagine your sister is probably getting the other side of the story after all these years.", "YTA. Let\u2019s take the adults out of the equation for a moment because you seem very argumentative regarding any comments about them. Speaking JUST about you and your sister: you are trying to control her feelings, perspective, and choices, and that is not okay. Reading someone\u2019s diary, trying to dictate their relationship with their parents (biological or not),  telling them who to be close to and what opinion to have of who\u2026 none of that is yours to decide for her. And you\u2019re trying to do just that, under the guise of \u201cmaking sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d If that was really your primary concern, you would do the actually caring thing, which is reassuring her you\u2019re there if she needs support and then staying out of her choices.", "YTA. When Tory won't speak to you remember how you betrayed her by reading her diary.", "People in healthy families do not refer to their mother as \"egg donor\". An egg donor donates an egg to a couple experiencing fertility problems. The woman you refer to as an \"egg donor\" is your mother. Calling her egg donor tells me that either you are a deeply disturbed young woman or you are the victim of a troublingly disturbed family dynamic - you have been controlled, manipulated and groomed. You are too young and unwordly to see this right now. I hope that in time you will grow to realise how unhealthy your family life is and that you are able to seek freedom from it. \n\nIf you can not love and support your sister without reporting to your father, then you need to leave your sister alone. \n\nI can't say YTA, because you are a victim of an abusive relationship - you just don't realise.", "INFO: based on your comments, I have a question for you. Do you believe that all of us who have jobs and went to public schools had terrible childhoods?", "YTA for reading her diary.

He is emotionally and mentally abusing you and your sister", "ESH.\nYou, because of reading your sister's diary, but it does seem like you genuinely want to help her, so I mostly mean your dad is TA. He's managed to convince you that:\n1. You and your sister don't need to work hard or be accountable, because no matter what, there's money to live in luxury. Having to work or go to public school is normal, healthy, and teaches you valuable life skills. \n2. Therapy is bad or ineffective, and that all those who practice or treat patients only do so to get as much money as possible out of them. Sure, there are therapists like that, as there are in every profession on earth. There are also many who genuinely care, and who want to help.\n3. Having a mental illness would make you a bad person. You'd be SHOCKED at how many people you know have a diagnosed mental illness. Anxiety. Depression. Any number of things, ranging from mild to severe, for which they undergo any number of treatments. It's a fact of life. There is always something to be done to help someone with a diagnosis of a mental illness, and MANY can lead a normal, happy, healthy life.\n4. It was completely in your best interests that he pushed your biological mother out of your life. It sounds like it was really just in HIS best interests, because he's had unopposed access to tell you whatever he wants, and because you are young and you love him, because he's your daddy and you trust him, you believe. That's distressing. Why doesn't he want you to ever know what it's like to struggle a bit? How will you become self sufficient if everything is made easy for you? I guarantee you HE had to struggle for some things... Did he establish the Family Business you refer to? Sounds like your dad is super smart, and either very manipulative, or possibly struggling with a mental illness of his own.\n\nIt's ok to question your dad's point of view, it's ok to have questions for your bio mom. If you can find it in you to ask your bio mom for help with your sister, maybe she can give you some insight? If what you really want is to help your sister, try to earn her trust back. Show her you can be a safe person to confide in.\n\nI wish you all the best.

We lived in Europe for most of our lives before that, going between the UK, the Netherlands, and Iceland ever since ED and dad got divorced, and he made her sign away her parental rights. We moved back to the states about a year ago, and ED wanted to see us again, and introduce us to the new family she funded with Dad's money. I didn't really care-- I have a mom, even if she isn't biologically mine-- but my sister \"Tory\" wanted to have a relationship with her really bad. \n\nDad basically said it was fine for them to start meeting each other, but it had to be at our house to start with, and he wanted ED to visit once a month for a year before we would meet her husband. The meetings were always awkward, and ED would usually cry and try and guilt me for not wanting to call her all the time while we were growing up, and try to make us call her \"mom.\" I get along pretty well with one of her kids, though, so I kept agreeing to meet up, but after a few months, when she started offering to take us out places alone, I said no. Tory said yes. \n\nAfter that, Tory started acting really, really weird. She started talking about how we're entitled, and spoiled, and basically started insulting everything to do with the way Mom and Dad raised us. She seemed really depressed, and I caught her crying a bunch of times. I got worried, so about a week ago, I read her diary and found out that she's actually already met ED's husband, even though Dad specifically said she would have to keep up visits for a year. If it were a recent thing, that's one thing, since it's been like ten months, but apparently, she met him for the first time all the way back in October. \n\nAnyway, I told Dad what was going on, and now he's saying that ED doesn't respect boundaries, and he's mad at Tory for keeping secrets. He doesn't want her going out alone with ED anymore, and has basically said that either he or Mom is going to be attending these outings with her until he can trust ED again. Tory's pissed that I told, and says that it's messed up that Dad basically forced ED to give us up. He did, but I don't really think that's a bad thing.

However, your dad wanted to divorce your bio mom all because she wanted to raise you and your sister to understand the difference between a normal life and a *privileged* one.

Now you are seeing the dangers of the \"cutthroat\" approach - sometimes you hurt people and this time you hurt someone you love.\n\nI agree that your sister's mental health is a legitimate concern for you.

How do you know the things that you say you know about public schools? When many people who actually attended public schools shared a very different experience, why don't you believe them? How many public schools have you personally visited? How many people do you know personally who told you about having a terrible experience at public schools?

Also, brainwashing her own older daughter, making her believe that she doesn\u2019t deserve a good education and a good life, it means, she wants that you two struggle with life and have a difficult life.

Yes, your sister needs some kind of professional help although your father and you are not enthusiastic about it: she needs to talk with someone she trusts in and sorts out her confusion (her life, her privileges, her opportunities, and instead of considering them undeserving, she should realize that those are blessings. In other words, if she wants to help others, she needs to help herself first. If she wants that others live well, she has to live well and leads by example too, helping others to have the same opportunities she has and she will have instead of losing them).

I'm sure your sister has realised that now without your ED saying anything at all. \n\nYou are not helping your sister in any way right now, you're actively harming her.

Sudden loss of a parent (biomom being forced to sign away her rights), being whisked away to another country, and being sheltered away from other people are all risk factors. The way you've been raised is very likely a huge factor in your diagnosis, and your father not seeking treatment for you will only make it worse. While not \"curable\" it can be helped with the right therapy, especially since you're still young.\n\nYou've said a dozen times that not giving your kids every opportunity when you're able would be child abuse, and your father outright *refused* to give you the tools you need to cope with the symptoms of your disorder.

I\u2019m not understanding why he stole you away from contact with your biological mother", "Why such a harsh pre-nup?", "So it sounds like he didn\u2019t force her to do anything.

Did he want you to have a life or not?", "That explains why your sister started randomly calling your family spoiled and entitled. I\u2019m going to say NTA. Though I don\u2019t agree fully with your dad. He does seem to want you and your sister to have the best in life since he has the money to afford it. He is even willing to let your ED visit even though she has no legal right to. He doesn\u2019t seem abusive or controlling. If he was he wouldn\u2019t let her around at all. I\u2019m concerned for your sister though because there\u2019s a way to have nice things without feeling guilty about having them. Her behavior is extreme and your dad should reconsider his stance on therapy. Therapy doesn\u2019t mean diagnosis. It means help and sorting things out. Your sister doesn\u2019t sound like she has a mental health issue. She needs help sorting her feelings as they relate to her mom. I do think your ED is an ahole though. She had the option of money or kids and she chose money. Just because he threatened to take full custody doesn\u2019t mean he would/could. Had he got full custody that\u2019s a big sign she was unfit. She either knew she\u2019d lose custody either way or she really only wanted the money. I also don\u2019t like how she is trying to guilt trip you and your sister into visiting when she actively signed her rights away and didn\u2019t visit. It\u2019s funny she calls you all spoiled yet lives in someone else\u2019s house, chose money over her kids, and the humble life she planned for you two didn\u2019t apply to herself. \n\nI\u2019d say apologize to your sister for going in the diary. If you can\u2019t get her to open up, then you can take the next step. Explain to her how you feel about the situation and why. And explain why you felt it was best for you to keep distance from your ED. Let her know you support her wanting a healthy relationship with her mom but that doesn\u2019t come with lying and dishonesty. An adult should never ask a child to lie or be sneaky. If they do something is not right. Also let her know there\u2019s nothing wrong with being able to do nice things for yourself and using your opportunities to improve. Just let her know you\u2019re there for her and on her side and you\u2019ll do your best to help her and listen. Talk to your dad about therapy or counseling. Counseling usually doesn\u2019t involve diagnosis or medication. They mainly talk things out and help develop a plan of action. They will recommend therapy/psychiatric help if they notice concerning things.", "Why are they creeps? What have they done that makes them creeps and not simply a mom trying to reconnect with her kids?", "That is awesome-normally; however, it doesn't sound like that is working currently. It might be worth a mention. You'd be amazed what even one session with a stranger and your family can do to get it all out there.", "I get that, but here's what is concerning: Your sister sees him as the villain. She was gaslit into believing that. She may see everything he has to say about the situation as lies. Having it come from an unbiased party could save years of confusion.\n\nWhen I was young, I spent years going to a youth group that I now recognize was a cult. When my parents realized how twisted it was, they pulled me out...but they didn't take me to therapy. Because I'd been taught that their beliefs were wrong, I didn't trust what they were saying.

I think that ED is going to mess up her head and make her hate herself though, and she's been talking about giving her college fund away.", "Daddy probably pays for her grades. Might not have that ability if she had to go to school with the poors. Having to actually study and think would be much more difficult, I\u2019m sure.", "That is private.", "Why? I'm not sure I understand what's abusive about that.", "That is private.", "I don't think charity is *wrong,* per se, but I do think forcing it on people is bad. She wanted to make us go to public schools, and not be educated at all. She wanted to make us get jobs, and she said we wouldn't even get things like our own cars or nice clothes, because she was worried we'd be \"spoiled.\" I think that trying to force your kids to have a low quality life and education because you want it to be \"fair\" is messed up, and I don't think you should have to care about everyone on the planet, especially over your own family.", "I don't know. This is just a lot and everyone is talking at once and I'm trying to read everything but there's so much of it.", "I don't know. If I get in trouble I go to him, and then I'm not in trouble anymore.", "I mean yeah, our family is pretty cutthroat sometimes, but that's just how we are. If she actually cared about Tory or me, she would want what's best for *us,* not what \"aligns with her morals\" and stuff. It's a good thing to be privileged, not something that you should try and take away from your own children.", "She choose money over fighting for custody though. If she had been a good and responsible parent, she shouldn't have had to worry about loosing custody, and she should've at least fought to keep her kids.", "I see. :(", "Looks like the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. She wants to be as controlling as daddy dearest.", "I'm just scared for her.", "I think it's because ED is telling her that the way we live and the things she likes are wrong.", "Thanks!!", "I think what they wanted to say about me was bad.", "They weren't offering treatment. They were saying it was something incurably awful about me and I was just a bad person forever.", "I'll do my best. I just apologized for reading her diary. She said she didn't want to talk right now. I'm scared.", "The first comment is completely reasonable. The fact that you are struggling to see why unfettered access to luxury goods might not serve you well in the future perhaps proves your mother's point! \n\nThe second comment seems a bit unpleasant, but would you accept that you might not be a reliable witness. Without context and an understanding of the conversation, it is difficult to get a full feeling for the sentence. \n\nMay I ask you another question... Do you muck out your own horse's stable? And why do you think I might ask you that?", "It seems like the controlling apple did not fall far from the controlling tree.", "What are you really worried about?", "Whatever it is obviously upset you. A diagnosis can be hard to accept for any kind of health condition. God knows I\u2019ve had my struggles accepting things. Sometimes just saying it, letting it out can help a little.", "Then why bring it up?", "Is it ADHD?", "...you don't understand how your dad getting you to believe that you're a bad person if you have a mental illness or need therapy is abusive? That's a seriously fucked up mentality to give your kid. I don't know what you got diagnosed for, but you aren't a bad person no matter what it was for, and your dad making you feel bad about it is literally abuse.", "He is actively denying you treatment, that is abuse", "Ignoring a diagnosis is just wrong and will bite you in the long run. What your father is doing is super irresponsible.", "The most egregious thing she ever did to you...was consider public schools, which, mind you, aren't bad. You're mad that she wanted to make you learn responsibility and earn your own hard-earned money as a teen. You're mad that she didn't plan on buying cars for you, but instead make you work for it. By nice clothes, you mean designer, don't you? \n\nYou(edit - and your father) are even more the AH. You *are* spoiled. You looking down on your biological mother and even calling her an egg donor is disgusting. \n\nYour sister having the decency to understand her mother and the difference in classes is amazing based on where you came from. Congratulations to her.  LC and NC is most likely on its way.\n\nThank you for the information.", "So she wanted to teach you responsibility as a teenager like how literally the majority of teenagers are raised. Definitely sounds like a monster /s.", "LMFAO HOLY SHIT \n\nHorrible things: getting a job. Public education.\n\nNormal things: force your sister to remain controlled by you and your father. \n\nNot only are you entitled, you\u2019re delusional. \nGenuinely hope your poor sister can get away from you.", "Do you think you are NOT spoiled?  Do you even listen to yourself?  You are incredibly entitled, stuck up, and you're looking down on everyone else?  Why would you think you'd find sympathy here?", "Wow, those are the horrible things that she was going to force you to do if she had stayed in your life? You think that's so horrible that it's worth your sister not having a relationship with her over? You have a LOT of growing up to do. Money isn't everything. It helps, definitely, but damn, you are in for a rude shock when money can't help you", "In all fairness, she was right. You are definitely spoiled. I\u2019d be ashamed if my kid ended up with the attitude you have.", "Then he's doing you a disservice. There will eventually come a day when your father's influence and money isn't enough to keep you out of trouble. I just hope the other person survives the circumstances", "What does that even mean? Are you trying to tell us that you or your sister have never done anything wrong in your entire lives that would deserve punishment? Or do you mean your dad just thinks you can do no wrong? If it's the latter,  than all your dad is doing is setting you up to fail in the real world.", "omg this made me shake with anger. You\u2019re such an entitled spoiled brainwashed brat and reality is going to smack you in the face when your precious daddy can\u2019t bail you out anymore.", "Ok have you heard of Alex Murdaugh? Seriously, look up him and his family and the way he raised his sons. Daddy took care of everything for them, made sure they wouldn\u2019t get in trouble even when they did questionable things (including manslaughter). Obviously it\u2019s an extreme example but your attitude that you don\u2019t have to be punished for anything and your dad will make it all go away just reminds me of that family.", ">our family is pretty cutthroat \n\nThat explains where you learned to be an AH.", "Oh honey.  When you grow up one day,  you'll understand. You are definitely TA for ratting out your sister and invading her privacy bc of your own spoiled privilege.  Your mom is 100% on the mark and you're simply too immature to know it yet. \n\nYour morals guide you in life, and that's how you decide what's best for yourself and your kids. So your comment is completely off the mark.", "So because she was on a waitresses salary and in a foreign country if I'm understanding correctly, she was not a responsible parent? OP already said her dad basically bullied her with his money into a sure lose custody case. What was she supposed to do? Spend every last dollar in court and then have no way to raise them? \n\nHave you read OPs comments? They literally split because she wanted the kids to go to public school and have consequences for their actions. Her dad sounds privileged AF and totally out of touch with what normal life is like.  Which is probably why raising kids with someone who does know what life is like for the 99% rest of us didn't work out.", "I'm honestly glad she didn't. The way she wanted to raise us sounds miserable to me.", "Understood but you are a child. It's possible you don't know as much of the story as you think. You are looking at it through the veil of your dad's side of the story. It's hard at your age to accept that there are two sides especially when you have heard one pov all your life.", "They sound like they are wrong, but when your sister goes no contact with all of you, I guess you can enjoy more of daddy's money", "A diagnosis itself isn't inherently bad, the stigma around certain diagnosis make things sound bad. Honestly, kid, it seems like your sister had a wake-up call and if you don't come to terms with how ignorant and condescending you sound you're gonna be in the same situation sooner or later.", "The therapist did not call you a bad person. You /your father are interpreting that diagnosis to mean that but it is not inherently bad or good (Yes I saw what it was from your dad's post). It means you have some differences and would benefit from strategies to help you in the real world. This will especially be a good thing if you are planning to attend a university and join your family's business because you cannot guarantee things being handed to you forever and you need to be able to work with even those you consider beneath you.", "If your dad is so against therapists and therapy, why did he take you to one in the first place?", "She was just being kind of awful all around. And no, I don't much out the stable, they pay someone to do that.", "I don't understand.", "I'm worried she's going to go down a bad path. I'm worried she's going to give up her education, and her happiness, and everything she loves, and us. I'm worried she's going to end up alone and won't know how to get back, or think she's worth getting back. I want her to know how much she's worth, and how much I love her, and that she deserves everything.", "There is a post with the father\u2019s POV from one year ago where he says the diagnosis and the fact that the father stops her from any kind of treatment just shows how much of a AH he is.", "I'll tell you... but can you send a chat? I don't want people here using it against me. A lot of them already think my whole family is awful.", "No.", "It was a really, really bad one. Like scary bad.", "They weren't offering treatment.", "I don't agree.", "OP's sister seems to have a good handle on the realities of the situation while OP is still living in the fantasy world her dad taught her. I feel for the mother here. All she wanted was for the kids to have a normal childhood with boundaries and reasonable expectations. Public school, regular clothes and to learn to earn what you wants. And she has been villainized for that. \n\nIn the end, OP's sister has some hope of a good future. So do the siblings on mom's side. I think OP is in for a eventual reality smack.", "Public schools are not an education. Children get abused in public schools more than literally anywhere else. They enforce unhealthy sleep schedules, and demand children obey arbitrary rules. Moreover, they're run by the government, and don't even teach based on individual children's learning paces. My father made sure that we always had the best education, and when he couldn't find a place up to standard after primary school, he had us tutored by some amazing people at home and took us all over Europe so we could learn about culture and history in a tactile way. \n\nAs far as nice clothes, yes, I do mean designer, but I also mean just decent. Like she expected us to wear clothing from department stores. They use *sythnetic fabrics* more often than not, which are actively unhealthy for kids. \n\nAlso, I have a mom. My mom's raised me for the last nine years, and she's the best mother anyone could ask for. She even gave our family three siblings, who I love dearly. I'm not going to call ED my mother of any sort. She isn't. She never had my best interests in mind, and I don't see why I should consider her anything but an egg donor.", "She wanted to put us in a situation where we'd be under the control of some random person, where we'd be yelled at, mistreated, and unhappy. Dad said no.", "He just makes the punishment go away, whether we deserve it or not.", "That's not nice.", "I don't think being cutthroat is bad. There's nothing wrong with having goals and doing what's necessary to achieve them. That's an act of self-love.", "What am I supposed to understand? That caring about your own goals and needs is selfish? Her morals were coming at the cost of us, of our happiness. Dad got us out of there before she could permanently impact our lives.", ">So because she was on a waitresses salary and in a foreign country if I'm understanding correctly, she was not a responsible parent? \n\nI said that if she was a responsible parent she wouldn't have to worry about losing custody over her children. Things may work differently in the US, but where I'm from it takes abuse and neglect for a parent to lose custody, especially a mother, over their children.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Spend every last dollar in court and then have no way to raise them?\n\nI don't see the issue with that tbh. If you love your children and believe you're what's best for them, then you fight for them. But in this case, she didn't even try to fight, but took the payout straight away.", "She was not in a foreign country, to be clear. If the way we were raised is \"out of touch,\" I do not want to get in touch.", "It's possible we don't either. What kind of mom chooses money over kids.", "I know that what dad did was probably morally wrong, but he did it for us and we benefited from his choices.", "That's a terrible thing to say.", "It was one of the really scary ones though... and I just want her to be okay again, you know?", "He wasn't against them before this. This is what caused him to be against them."]}
