Having had similiar childhood experiences, to me it sounds like you should cut your loses and enjoy the day without your mum. She sounds like she has no remorse for aiding and supporting abuse towards you, and she doesn\u2019t care enough about you to get past her shit for your wedding. Sounds to me like she doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you, sorry.", "NTA. Nothing here makes you a bridezilla.\n\n>she\u2019a going to be forced to be in the same room as my uncle, who once called CPS on her due to my stepdad abusing my brother and I, and my mom concealing the abuse.\n\nShe did what!? I'm amazed you're giving her a chance to be there.\n\n>she told me she had her own boundaries and she wasn't willing to cross them\n\nStopping the abuse of her children wasn't one of them though.", "NTA. No one really tells you this, but as soon as you become an adult, you get to choose your family. You get to choose who you surround yourself with, it's unfortunate and difficult to deal with but both your parents sound toxic. This is gunna be the happiest day of your life, let nothing and *no one* ruin it for you both", "Definitely NTA, it's not much to expect two people just to be in the same room together for your wedding day. You want to have a relationship with both people or at the very least deem them important enough to allow them to be involved in one of the happiest days of your life, so its understandable that you would wish that they could put their differences aside for a day. I hope your wedding goes well and many congratulations to you!", "NTA... you're not a bridezilla...\n Seriously your mom doesnt know how to ignore and avoid (walk away) from your uncle or even anyone else she doesnt wanna see... I'm sure there will be plenty of people there for her to interact with it or talk to", "NTA but serious question - why do you want one of your abusers at your wedding??", "NTA. I am like you - my father is from a country where being gay is illegal so when I get married it's likely he won't be there. It sounds like you have a one-sided relationship with your mum. Your uncle had concerns and raised them and if your mum is mad about it then she shouldn't show up. I am so sorry that it's like this and it feels like everything sucks. Make sure you understand that it's your special day with your new bride and that is what is most important. Not other people's drama.", "NTA...you're not being a bridezilla at all. Your mother needs to face her demons, and this would be a good time. Surround yourself with joy and try to ignore the rest. Good luck on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA and I feel like both of this is simply because your parents don\u2019t accept you marrying a woman. I know this really hurts and sucks and I\u2019m so sorry for you but maybe it\u2019s better that they won\u2019t come since their sour attitude could easily spoil your wedding day. \nI hope you have a great wedding regardless!", "NTA you are not being a bridezilla you are being reasonable for wanting everyone to at least tolerate each other for a few hours.", "NTA. I struggle to understand why you'd want her there anyways. You said she's complicit in the abuse you suffered. That'd be absolutely valid justification for cutting off contact completely. Maybe invite your uncle instead?", "Do you really need someone who let her own children be abused? If you have to choose, choose your uncle! He is true family.\n\nIf you haven't seen your father in 10 years he's not important in your life. You don't need him there. \n\nYou don't need neither of them. \n\nSurround yourself with people who love you and care for you.", "NTA.  Quite honestly, it sounds like your uncle is the only member of that generation of your family who should be invited to your wedding.", "NTA. Your mother showed that she doesn't care about you (covering up for abuse, so she would not look bad. Beeing mad, that someone steped up to do something, ...)\n\nBut don't try to force your mother to be there. She will make it all about herself in one way or another. You can have a really nice wedding without your parents. Although it will hurt, but if you have your loved friends and family there it is much more important than a mother who is not willing to put her own anger away for her childs big day. \n\nBut also tell your mother (f you are willing to) that if she is missing this day, she will be cut off. No more visits, no help when she gets older, she won't be allowed to see any grandchildren (if you two are planing to have some in the future)", "NTA. It's heartbreaking to think that the people who should be 2nd most important in your life (after your fiance\u00e9) can't put aside their differences for a few hours to support you. Being upset about that isn't being a Bridezilla, it's being human.\n\nThat said, another commenter mentioned families of choice and they are absolutely right. Shared DNA doesn't make a family. Don't let your bio-family's selfishness ruin your day. You'll find your true family. Hugs.", "Enjoy your day with your love and the people who want to be there. \n\nDon\u2019t let their choices cloud your day. \n\nCongratulations.", "The bigger question here is why are you even inviting your mother to your wedding if she put her relationship with her husband before the welfare of her children? \n\nNTA", "NTA and your mother is trash (sorry). She's mad at her brother for trying to help her children that she was allowing to be abused? _trash_.\n\nHonestly if this is how she acts I promise you you will have a much lovelier day without her. Spend time with people who love and care about you. Congrats in getting married \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Your mother showed you who she really is when she said she was more mad at a warranted call to the CPS, than her abusive husband who she enabled. Cut your losses, she isn\u2019t worth it.", "NTA but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing you can do. Focus on your future wife, all the loving people in your life and your wedding. Don\u2019t waste anymore energy on her.", "I have a question. Why on earth would you want someone who was complicit in abuse suffered by yourself and your brother at your wedding?", "NTA.\n\nBut I reckon it might be good to get your Dad to come. Sure, there might be some awkwardness but if he's willing to come to a lesbian wedding despite his cultural background, it sounds like there might be a possibility of bringing that gap/awkwardness?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not just me overreacting, weirdly", "I know it might be controversial but she\u2019s my mother\u2026 for a while she raised my brother and I alone, and even though now I know that it was very toxic, she always belittled the abuse my brother and I suffered (she was abused too by my stepdad, but chose to stay with him due to buying a house together) for a long time I believed her", "He didn't betray her, he protected you. Your uncle is good people, your mother, not so much.", "Why are you inviting your mother? Your mother condoned the abuse of you and your brother.  That makes your mother an abuser.\n\nWhy should your brother, your uncle, and you have to put up with someone who allowed the abuse of you.\n\nPlease do not be angry with your mother not attending. You should be angry for her being an abuser.", "I don\u2019t know whether you plan on being walked down the aisle but from what you\u2019ve written, if anyone deserves that honour it\u2019s your uncle. \n\nNTA", "The person you responded to is absolutely right.  \n\nThere's a real reddit trend to ignore the complexity of relationships and tell people to cut others out.  Real families and people are emotionally complex.  That's your mom, and it's understandable that you have a whole host of emotions tied up into the relationship, the choices she makes, and the way those choices impact you.\n\nYour post is a tiny slice of life, and not the whole picture,  but the picture it shows is a mom who has, and continues to let their child down. \n\nYou should not have faced abuse, she should have protected you, and yet she continues to belittle even the idea that you were harmed.  Your mom's priorities are in the wrong place, and sadly they're not focused on your wellbeing. \n\nI'm sorry that you're having to deal with this as you lead up to your wedding.  It's crappy and a reminder of past/ongoing emotional harm.  At risk of oversimplifying because we don't know your whole situation, it sounds like you should find ways to reduce the expectations you have on your mom, because if you don't, I think she's going to continue letting you down in your life.", "It sounds like your uncle has been a loving and protective presence in your life \u2014 maybe you could have him walk you down the aisle, if you want to do that? You do have family on your side even if it\u2019s not your mom and dad.", "Yup. You're right. Just because it wasn't THAT bad doesn't mean it wasn't still abuse. My father used to say \"look I'm not getting drunk and hitting you so it's not abuse\", still hit us though. \n\nI hope you find peace and healing by whatever metric you use, friend.", "Honestly OP it sounds like you need a whole different level of love and support. I\u2019d recommend some of the support subs for parents - the only two I\u2019m aware of personally are r/raisedbynarcissists and r/raisedbyborderlines on Reddit but there\u2019s a variety of other resources on other social medias I could point you to!"]}
