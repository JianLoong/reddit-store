She\u2019s been mad at him ever since, even though that call was absolutely warranted (edit: she was also ungodly mad at me for telling my uncle, and made me apologise to my stepdad for leaking their secret)\n\nFrom her pov, she told me she had her own boundaries and she wasn\u2019t willing to cross them.

Am I being controlling or is this as big of a deal as I feel it is??\n\nEDIT: One of the reasons why she doesn\u2019t see the issue with not coming is because she thinks weddings are a huge waste of money and ressources, and that my future wife and I are already being over the top by getting married\n\nThe reason why I want her there is because for a very long time she told me that we were not really being abused, and for a long time I believed her when I didn\u2019t know any better, so I ended up getting over it, or at least pretending it never happened\n\nAlso I was something like 11 when the CPS call happened, and she made me cut contact with my uncle and aunt.

Having had similiar childhood experiences, to me it sounds like you should cut your loses and enjoy the day without your mum. She sounds like she has no remorse for aiding and supporting abuse towards you, and she doesn\u2019t care enough about you to get past her shit for your wedding. Sounds to me like she doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you, sorry.", "NTA.

I'm amazed you're giving her a chance to be there.\n\n>she told me she had her own boundaries and she wasn't willing to cross them\n\nStopping the abuse of her children wasn't one of them though.", "NTA. No one really tells you this, but as soon as you become an adult, you get to choose your family. You get to choose who you surround yourself with, it's unfortunate and difficult to deal with but both your parents sound toxic. This is gunna be the happiest day of your life, let nothing and *no one* ruin it for you both", "Definitely NTA, it's not much to expect two people just to be in the same room together for your wedding day. You want to have a relationship with both people or at the very least deem them important enough to allow them to be involved in one of the happiest days of your life, so its understandable that you would wish that they could put their differences aside for a day. I hope your wedding goes well and many congratulations to you!", "NTA... you're not a bridezilla...\n Seriously your mom doesnt know how to ignore and avoid (walk away) from your uncle or even anyone else she doesnt wanna see... I'm sure there will be plenty of people there for her to interact with it or talk to", "NTA but serious question - why do you want one of your abusers at your wedding??", "NTA. I am like you - my father is from a country where being gay is illegal so when I get married it's likely he won't be there. It sounds like you have a one-sided relationship with your mum. Your uncle had concerns and raised them and if your mum is mad about it then she shouldn't show up. I am so sorry that it's like this and it feels like everything sucks. Make sure you understand that it's your special day with your new bride and that is what is most important. Not other people's drama.", "NTA...you're not being a bridezilla at all. Your mother needs to face her demons, and this would be a good time. Surround yourself with joy and try to ignore the rest. Good luck on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA and I feel like both of this is simply because your parents don\u2019t accept you marrying a woman. I know this really hurts and sucks and I\u2019m so sorry for you but maybe it\u2019s better that they won\u2019t come since their sour attitude could easily spoil your wedding day. \nI hope you have a great wedding regardless!", "NTA you are not being a bridezilla you are being reasonable for wanting everyone to at least tolerate each other for a few hours.", "NTA. I struggle to understand why you'd want her there anyways. You said she's complicit in the abuse you suffered. That'd be absolutely valid justification for cutting off contact completely. Maybe invite your uncle instead?", "Do you really need someone who let her own children be abused? If you have to choose, choose your uncle! He is true family.\n\nIf you haven't seen your father in 10 years he's not important in your life. You don't need him there. \n\nYou don't need neither of them. \n\nSurround yourself with people who love you and care for you.", "NTA.  Quite honestly, it sounds like your uncle is the only member of that generation of your family who should be invited to your wedding.", "NTA. Your mother showed that she doesn't care about you (covering up for abuse, so she would not look bad. Beeing mad, that someone steped up to do something, ...)\n\nBut don't try to force your mother to be there. She will make it all about herself in one way or another. You can have a really nice wedding without your parents. Although it will hurt, but if you have your loved friends and family there it is much more important than a mother who is not willing to put her own anger away for her childs big day. \n\nBut also tell your mother (f you are willing to) that if she is missing this day, she will be cut off. No more visits, no help when she gets older, she won't be allowed to see any grandchildren (if you two are planing to have some in the future)", "NTA. It's heartbreaking to think that the people who should be 2nd most important in your life (after your fiance\u00e9) can't put aside their differences for a few hours to support you. Being upset about that isn't being a Bridezilla, it's being human.\n\nThat said, another commenter mentioned families of choice and they are absolutely right. Shared DNA doesn't make a family. Don't let your bio-family's selfishness ruin your day. You'll find your true family. Hugs.", "Enjoy your day with your love and the people who want to be there. \n\nDon\u2019t let their choices cloud your day. \n\nCongratulations.", "The bigger question here is why are you even inviting your mother to your wedding if she put her relationship with her husband before the welfare of her children? \n\nNTA", "NTA and your mother is trash (sorry). She's mad at her brother for trying to help her children that she was allowing to be abused? _trash_.\n\nHonestly if this is how she acts I promise you you will have a much lovelier day without her. Spend time with people who love and care about you. Congrats in getting married \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Your mother showed you who she really is when she said she was more mad at a warranted call to the CPS, than her abusive husband who she enabled.

Don\u2019t waste anymore energy on her.", "I have a question. Why on earth would you want someone who was complicit in abuse suffered by yourself and your brother at your wedding?", "NTA.\n\nBut I reckon it might be good to get your Dad to come.

It's crappy and a reminder of past/ongoing emotional harm.

Wow. The projection is strong. Maybe neither want to attend because they risk being called out for the total TAs they are.
