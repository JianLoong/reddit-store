I laughed it off, said okay, and went about my day.  Within six months, I was questioning.  It took several more years before I was comfortably calling myself Bi and coming out to friends and family.    I think I must have given off vibes to my parents for Dad to come straight out and say it like that - but at no point in time did he assume, make comments alluding to, nothing.  I was given time and space to reach that conclusion on my own.\n\nYou took that away from your son.  Instead of saying something to the effect of \"If you are, cool - if not, cool.

I mean it's terrible we have to hide anything at all, but if you're not ready for people to know, don't go around showing off things that obviously give it away and then get mad when someone has connected the dots, especially if that someone isn't even being malicious about it and has no way of being aware of what the entire situation even means. You're punishing an ally, that we desperately need as many of as we can get. I mean really, with fascism bearing down on us yall want to scream at the mother who just told her son \"honey, you're not as inconspicuous as you think you are\".\n\nOP, it looks like you're a loving parent and had no ill will towards your child. There is a lot of fear and uncertainty involved with coming out and since your child is now realizing he may not have that security any more, those emotions are getting charged. The best thing to do (based on what I felt I wanted before I came out) is to just continue to show him that it makes no difference in your love and support of him.", "YTA\n\nHe has every right to be angry at you for outing him and for laughing at him. This is something your son will remember for the rest of his life and you did a piss poor job of making sure he felt supported", "I mean... Is like... Are u supporting him? I mean... What a situation huh", "NTA. You said it with no harm and its not like you explicitly told anyone about this. His actions spoke for him. Everyone calling you an asshole is acting like you did a huge homophobic lay on him. You literally asked if his bf would come in a private convo. He reacted defensively so theres more to tap in as to why hes uncomfortable but everyone else is.", "NTA?\n\nIs it possible to even out someone to themself?", "NAH- i can see both side, i said sit down with ur son and reassured him that you love him, that you didn\u2019t know it was supposed to be an secret and involved the bf over offically, as the bf, for dinner.", "Imo nta, seems like some internalised homophobia. There\u2019s always gonna be some awkwardness talking to your parents about relationships regardless.

You didn't out him if he was obvious enough for you to know.", "Going to have to give a YTA for the laugh. \n\nDid you tell him the BF would be welcome?

So your initial question is misleading. It\u2019s assholish to make an assumption about someone\u2019s sexuality or relationship status, but if it\u2019s your own kid living in your house and the evidence you are presenting is accurate, I think most parents would assume the same.\n\nYou made an incorrect assumption.* (Pending your son actually coming out, officially, of his own choosing, anything you assume about his sexuality is incorrect or at least premature.) The appropriate reaction is to apologize for making that assumption, tell him you\u2019re glad he\u2019s so secure in his close male friendships, and ask if his friend who is a boy wants to come on the trip.\n\nSo apologize and you WNBTA.", "YTA, it\u2019s his decision when to come out, not yours. You overstepped personal boundaries there but it\u2019s not ok just because he\u2019s your son.

OP wasn\u2019t being malicious but trying to just make it normal for her son. It was not going to be a big deal to OP or her husband no matter how dramatic/theatric her son thought his coming out to be. OP\u2019s reaction is her reaction. Her son may be angry she laughed at his denial but the point is, the truth didn\u2019t change.\n\nUltimately, there really isn\u2019t a perfect moment to come out despite how much effort one puts into it. It isn\u2019t supposed to be a celebratory moment like being proposed to. It shouldn\u2019t even be a \u201cthing\u201d to have to come out. Why do gay people have to come out when straight people don\u2019t? Gay, lesbian, queer, non-binary, trans, etc people should just be treated like they\u2019re supposed to exist. Making someone feel like they have to hide themselves let alone have to come out is just wrong. Unfortunately, acceptance still isn\u2019t universal but let\u2019s not bash on people who make awkward situations to validate someone\u2019s sexuality/gender/identity unnecessary. \n\nAs a gay person who overthought and over analyzed my parents\u2019 reactions (two sets, since they both divorced and remarried) my big coming out announcement was underwhelming.

My stepmom was very undisturbed and just hugged me and told me to give my dad some time to process. In the moment, I was disappointed since I had wasted so much anxious energy worrying about their reactions but I would rather have had this happen then some grand tumultuous homophobic ranting and raving. Or worse, getting kicked out and ostracized. \n\nI\u2019m sure OP\u2019s son is relieved and will come to realize what a blessing it is to have his parents treat him no differently just because he\u2019s gay.", "Sort of an AH.

I say sort of because you laughed at him when he tried to assert to you that he was straight. Can\u2019t imagine how hard it would be for anyone to come out to their parents and to have you laugh at him is pretty cold and callous.

Idk her identity now but she dates guys too.) so I thought I could trust them because they understood how I felt, right? Next thing I know, the very next day I had everyone in class staring at me and whispering before being bombarded with comments and questions about my sexuality. Turns out my \u201cfriend\u201d had told everyone in the 7th grade. I made a scene in class, yelling at her that I told her not to say anything about it for her to reply with \u201cYou never said not to tell anyone. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d It was earth shattering. I felt like I lost any ounce of security and safety.

I never got that and it tore me apart for a long time because I felt a part of me was taken and stomped all over.

That doesn\u2019t mean he is also comfortable with you knowing about his sexuality however. You definitely could have handled the situation more delicately.

I was nearly ready on my terms to say something, but trust me: this is something your queer child thinks about all the time. Coming out is a big deal and it should never be done on someone else's terms, or when *they* figure it's time. Your son wasn't ready and you forced him--so he denied it. And he said you're wrong--maybe you are, maybe you're not--either way, it's not your place to tell him *you* know better on *his* sexuality. That's super presumptuous.", "NTA!

OP talked with their son in private conversation with no audience. They were very accepting of him and did not made a scene of it.\n\nAll those comments saying that she shouldn't have assumed her son like boys. Are you for real? Of course anyone sane will assume he like boys with what was going on. More obvious and they'd be full on kissing on the sofa in front of everybody.\n\nIt was so obvious that I would have also laughed if he tried to deny it in a private conversation. Like it can only be a joke at this point. Like someone telling me in full seriousness that tomorrow the sun will rise from the west. That person is either insane or joking, so I'll laugh.\n\nAs for those saying she labeled her son as gay. She did not. She invited his obvious boyfriend. So he could be gay or bi or pan but she did not label him.\n\nAlso for the \"outing\" thing. To out someone requires them to be in closet as in not out. That boy was very much out of closet even if he did not know it himself. You cannot act like you are in a relationship and at the same time require everyone around you to be oblivious to it. We are not fools and you cannot ask us to be fools. Secondly a parent who noticed their child being in a relationship can absolutly talk of said relationship with their child. If it was meant to stay a secret then you failed, but you cannot say that you were outed.", "That is the exact opposite way of how you should have handled that. Well done.", "yeah, i find the dichotomy of people saying parents are the last to find out that there kids are gay is bullshit. Christ my best mate and his brothers and I knew his brother was gay at about 9 or 10. when he finally came out. It was like what took you so long? I think if your attentive to your kids you know. So he clearly hasnt come to terms with it. It must be a struggle for many gay people when society is clearly geared towards opposite sex. DOnt be so hard on yourself. Atleast he knows now 100% that you know. You need to kind of mention to him that his dad knows aswell. Then you can all discuss it together. Whats more important is that your willing to support him.", "YTA OP. If it was so obvious he was gay, you had plenty of time to research how to go about this. You are his parent. You\u2019re supposed to be making him comfortable and help him come to terms with himself and his position in this world, gay or not. You failed on that aspect. \n\nYou should\u2019ve sat down with him privately and reassured him that you will always love him no matter what. You should\u2019ve discussed safe sex. You should\u2019ve asked him questions and let him ask questions. You did none this.\n\nAnd laughing in his face was terrible. What are you thinking. You\u2019re going to make your son feel isolated.

What I would give for people in my country to be as accepting as you are. Your son needs to thank his lucky stars and stop being so dramatic. So many of us aren\u2019t privileged to have such acceptance.", "YTA.\n\nThere was a way to handle this, and this wasn\u2019t it, this situation required tact and grace, and you could have waited for him to tell you when he was ready.", "Wow. YTA OP and it's crazy that you had to ask. You outed your own son. Regardless if your family is ok with your being gay, you still don't out him.

How is straight still the default.", "YTA, you need to apologize and explain you made a mistake in trying to help him come out in a low pressure way. You need to recognize how this was hard for him and you hurt him deeply. Without this apology, he will never ever ever truly MAYBE forgive you (there\u2019s no guarantee)", "NTA. Someone came out to me after I had known them and their partner for years, and we had been on trips together, and thought it would be a surprise because they'd always referred to them as a friend. I guess I was supposed to say something supportive but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, of course- I've known for 10 years. So i get your initial reaction. But then I sent a heartfelt email thanking them for telling me and sending my love and support. May I suggest doing so if they're not ready to talk to you. Some people want big emotional moments, others don't, and while it's sometimes difficult to know what people will want, it's important to try to give it to them even if it's out of your comfort zone.", "YTA in my mind for two things.\n\n1. Calling the other guy \"his boyfriend\" if he hasn't been introduced to you like that. Would it have killed you to called him \"your friend\" or by his name? There is a reason your son didn't introduce him as his boyfriend and you should have respected it.\n\n2. YOU LAUGHED AT HIM. If your son behaviour is obvious and he still denies it, he is probably still figuring out things in his mind. He had the right to his own timeline when it comes to his own sexuality. Laughing at people doesn't show acceptance, it looks like you are mocking him.\n\nYou don't seem particularly bad though, you should talk to him, apologize for assuming things and tell him the invitation for \"whatshisname\" still stands.", "YTA. Your laughed at him in his face while also outing him before he was ready. You could not of handled this worse. \n\nWhen my kid told me she was bi I legit just said \"me too\" and then told her to clean her room.

I just wanted to meet them and know they are treating eachother with respect. Nothing else is my business. Then she spent an hour telling me about her crushes. Did I know before she said anything? Yeah, I'm her mom. You notice little things. But you dont bring attention anything till they do. This shit is confusing and hard enough as it is.", "ESH. It seems that your son was hoping for / expecting a grand coming out experience that was honestly never required. This is actually how it should be, family casually asking if the bf/gf is coming away with you without it being a big deal, your kid could have been grateful for that acceptance and missed the opportunity, however, the laughing was probably more than a little unnecessary. The irony is your kid had the family we all hope it will be, where it doesn\u2019t need to be an issue, he just didn\u2019t know he had that family. I\u2019ve alway asked my kids if they have a gf/bf so they know it won\u2019t matter in the future, sounds like your kid had no idea it would be accepted, if he should have known as you\u2019ve been open then I think he was a little dramatic.", "Nta", "YTA.\n\nYou abruptly confronted him with what you assume his sexuality to be, laughed when he was blindsided by it, and laughed even more when he got scared and tried to deny it.

That's definitely something only gay people do! /s\n\nYou are correct, putting all of this together in a society that doesn't let men be affectionate with friends does make it look like they're dating. Either that or your son doesn't think that caring behaviour emasculates him. From your description I'd say there's maybe an 85-90% chance they're dating, but as someone who has more than one friendship in that remaining 10-15%, it's rude to assume.

However he should apreciate that his parent knows and is comfortable enough that they could laugh thinking it was a happy moment and not a grim and tense moment.

But as a parent, you should try to empathise with your child, and it was clear from her own description that he felt uncomfortable and upset. She laughed harder at his awkwardness. If you ever feel 'put on the spot' and someone laughs at you, it makes you feel worse. When he said to her that he wasn't ready for the coming out conversation, she should have apologised for not handling it very well. For him, it must have been embarrassing finding out that he was presenting as gay unintentionally. By her own admission he is 'straight presenting' so he could have been trying to stay in the closet until he figured out how to come out.

Nobody gets mad when a guy obvious has a girlfriend and hasn\u2019t told anyone yet. And then their parents ask about it they don\u2019t get defensive and serious. Because it was obvious. Probably the safest environment for someone who is gay to be in, is in a home where the parents don\u2019t care. Because it isn\u2019t special.

Most told me that they wished I had said something to them earlier.  \nSometimes we need a bit of a push because we're scared to be who we are.  Maybe laughing wasn't great but it wasn't the worst reaction either. Do not dwell on this.  It's better for him to be who he is and not hide it.

It\u2019s pretty apparent that he reacted out of fear of rejection when he asked you not to tell his father, which is pretty heartbreaking. If you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d think through how you would break it to him that his father already knows, even though saying \u201che already knows\u201d seems so simple and causal, I think your son has really nailed it into his head that him coming out could exile him.

I really do hope your relationship has a solid foundation and that this didn't just sink a nail in its coffin.", "Agreed (and also a member of the queer community here). IMO the laughing was not laughing at him, it is basically laughing at the situation - it has been extremely obvious and to some extent OP's son must have been comfortable enough to be openly hugging, snuggling and basically quite openly dating this boy without explicitly saying 'I am gay'.\n\nOP was basically saying 'I know, it's okay.' It possibly could have been worded a bit better (e.g. 'you know I accept you however you are, and I notice that X is very special to you...'). Idk if it might be a cultural difference but I'm from the UK and this lightheartedness and laughter is not outside the ordinary for how people would react and I'm a bit shocked at the other comments acting like OP is belittling their child.\n\nI think the best thing OP can do now just to clear the air is to say I'm sorry I laughed, I just want you to know I love and accept you and I am happy you feel comfortable here. It can be very scary coming out, and he might have been expecting it to be taken in a different way and being a 'bigger thing' and is instead very taken aback that everyone seems to already know.", "It\u2019s not abusive, etc. - but could have been handled a lot better by OP.

He\u2019s welcome to join us as your friend, of course. I love you very much!\u201d", "Gay man here, in agreement. I understand that there are good and bad ways to react to a coming out. I also understand that it\u2019s considered rude to out someone. However, the son outed himself. Did the mom say the perfect things? No. But she\u2019s clearly unbothered and supportive. Having this conversation, awkward as it may be, is the first step to the song being comfortable being openly out with his boyfriend. NAH. \n\nIt really does shock me the number of people who think they can be in a gay relationship and manage to keep it secret from everyone around them, and then get offended when people realize they\u2019re gay. I\u2019m having flashbacks to dating closeted boys in college.", "As a gay man, if this is how my mom had handled 'the talk', I would've never forgiven her. Your experiences and opinions are not universal, you don't get to decide whether or not someone else's actions are \"okay\" based on how you yourself would react.\n\nShe said herself that her son was not ready to have this conversation and the whole reason he's not talking to her is because she essentially forced it. I didn't get to choose when I got to come out either (pressured into it by my then-boyfriend's mom) and I will always carry resentment over that. But at least my mom's reaction was just making sure I knew it wasn't a big deal to her and that she still loved me, not her having several laughing fits during the most vulnerable sit-down of my life.", "I agree but think she\u2019s the ah for laughing. Not so much at this situation but as a \u201cread the room\u201d vibe. If someone made a comment about a dead person, and someone wasn\u2019t paying attention and laughed because they thought It was a joke, people would still be upset.

Yes, our GOAL is to get there on a social level. The goal will be reached (I have faith in that) and sooner or later queer people themselves will be the ones to perceive that we are getting there. \n\nAs of now, however, it isn't. So: parents dismissing all the emotional and complicated fears of coming out is a problem. A big problem, for someone. You can't just bypass that being queer and being straight isn't the same; it's the reality (for now). A family should treat them with the same respect and love, help them, but \"same respect and love\" isn't necessarily \"the same way\". \"The same way\" erases the differences and emotional distress. The way you would laugh about a boy saying \"noo she totally isn't my girlfriend\" can't be replicated without sounding dumb or mean for a boy hiding to have a boyfriend; they aren't the same, the reasons, emotional distress and fears aren't remotely the same.\n\nThere absolutely is a way to be supportive and creating a safe environment at home that also respects the fact that socially, queer people live a totally different life and you can't act like you live in an alternative reality \"detaching\" your house from the actual society. The queer son can't split himself in two parts: he lives in society and not just in the house, so it's pointless to act like that and not recognizing and respecting the difference and how it impacts their way of living their love, including presenting the partners. There is a better way to be supportive which isn't consisting of blindly ignoring the material reality.", "I agree. Yes laughing at him was being the AH. But including him and his bf on a trip like it was completely normal was appropriate, welcoming, accepting thing do do. Yes he probably was caught off guard at first if he didn't think anyone knew, but I'm sure that him feeling they were both welcome and that it was a big deal was important to him.  If we all want to be treated the same why does it have to be some big dramatic thing. That would never be the case for a hetero relationship.", "Not to mention the fact that if he is out to his friend group then the only people in his life that he isn't out to are his parents who clearly don't have a problem with.  If he isn't out to his friends group but his parents are picking up on it then his friend group is at the very least suspicious.\n\nI mean I think as teens we can all remember the gay or straight couple that were hooking up but constantly telling everyone they were \"just friends\" and the cuddles were \"strictly platonic\".  Everyone knew they were bangin' but they were convinced they had the room fooled.", "Yes. The laughing I\u2019m sure hurt him in the moment but it wasn\u2019t malicious like people here are making it out to be.

The same happens when someone laughs at the death of a loved one (even though they feel a lot of pain) or in uncomfortable situations where they don't know how to act.  It is what it is.  However, with OP, the laugh is because she doesn't see any problem and wants to downplay the matter, the same would happen if he had a \"hidden\" girlfriend.  The funny thing is not his sexuality, the funny thing is that he tried to hide his OBVIOUS partner from him under the parents' noses.  Logically if you treat someone as your partner is what your parents will think, that boy was not being discreet at all.  Also as a comment he says above:\n\n\u201c- If he is soooo obvious in front of you guys and he is clueless about how clear his actions are\u2026 THAT is going to be dangerous for him in the wrong setting.\n\nIf he wanted to hide it, it\u2019s better for him to hear he did a terrible job hiding it while in a safe space.

The positive I see from all this is that now the boy knows that he is being obvious and he will take better care of his behavior in environments that are really dangerous for him, sadly it is something that is better to know sooner rather than later, this world is still not safe for the community.", "Thank you.

It took several more years before I was comfortably calling myself Bi and coming out to friends and family.

And maybe he\u2019s still figuring it out, which is cool, but I doubt OP\u2019s conversation with him forced him into a place to confront that; I would think the whole *being in a queer relationship thing* would have been the trigger for that.", "That's what I was thinking.\n\nTheir son was already aware. He has a boyfriend or at least a boy he is courting.", "As an aside,  how are people to know if someone is not out if they act like they are? I mean for people outside the family. We used to have a neighbor's son babysit our kids. We thought he was out.  He seemed pretty comfortable being himself and always sharing stories about him and Devin their ups and downs. He went off to college and a year later his mom comes over,  sits us down,  and tells us her son came out. I was so thankful I'd never said anything casual to her about it during the high school years and blown it. But how does a person know out/not out - coworkers and new friends don't do a big announcement you just sort of pick it up", "I think she was laughing at the idea that he thought he was keeping it a secret when it was super obvious. That seems like classic dumb teenager shit that parents can chuckle at", "Me too, I am queer and my parents all totally sucked when I came out to them individually.  \"That's just a phase,\" from one; \"You don't want to choose that life, it's going to be tough\" from another.  The one who told me it's just a phase is my biggest champion and loved my spouse and is my biggest support through divorce and dating new people, I still tease him about his response when I came out but he did other imperfect things as a parent.\n\nIt'll be OP's follow through that matters the most.  An apology for laughing wouldn't hurt but not because they're an asshole, just because it's the socially polite thing to do.  I hope OP does follow up and have sincere and loving and supportive talks with their kid.", "Okay yes thank you. I'm seeing a lot of straight people here commenting on how terrifying it is to come out. And yeah as a queer person it is scary. But this situation is totally different in my eyes. The son is obviously in a gay relationship and isn't really good at hiding it. And OP just asked a question and laughed out of pure shock. I would have laughed too!!!\n\nNot to call people sensitive *because I am a sensitive person,* But I feel like this is blowing things out of proportion a little. Yeah she should say sorry for laughing at him and that she loves him, but it's not like she did anything to warrant calling her heartless. When I came out at 17 it didn't matter how my parents took it I would have taken it wrong because I was on edge, now that I'm older it doesn't matter. All that matters is they love me and accept me. And OP loves and accepts him.\n\nEdit to add NAH", "Laughter is involuntary, but it seems there was more than laughter involved here, so, yeah, a definite fumble.", "Yes you do. People laugh at each other all the time. Jfc what world do you live in?", "Yeah, why is that comment (the one you are responding to) upvoted so much? There are plenty of really good responses to this situation.", "I swear some people in this sub love reading so much drama into every post. People turn this one interaction that could most likely be solved with one heartfelt conversation into OP's son potentially ending their relationship with OP.", "THANK YOU. Exactly. Most people's coming out experience is nothing like the movies lol. Some people don't come out at all.", "People are surprisingly oblivious to how obvious they are sometimes. I remember a coworker being shocked when I asked if she was dating another coworker of ours ... she'd been openly discussing it with a third coworker while I was right nearby a few days prior.", "Yup. You can be laughing for an entirely unrelated reason but you still need to pay attention to the other person's mood. If you are laughing while someone is crying/freaking out then you are being rude.", "Depends on who he was porking...", "He also may not be gay, he could be bi, or any of the labels put on sexual orientation and preference. It could be men right now, but that could change. It\u2019s a personal thing for him to figure out, not for others to dictate", "It\u2019s not about that\u2014the point of view of OP, thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal is not the point of view of OP\u2019s son. \n\nJust because something isn\u2019t a big deal or is \u201cobvious\u201d to one person doesn\u2019t mean it is the same for someone else. Including the son. The son might not just think he is being sneaky, being in the closet is a really big deal and absolutely not at all some kind of conscious, well-reasoned choice like people tend to assume. \n\nOP should not have assumed it was not a big deal or even that it was just some obvious thing to OP\u2019s son. \n\nThe AH move here was OP projecting OP\u2019s own assumptions and opinions about OP\u2019s son accepting and opening up about his sexuality onto the son. Put differently, even asking this question here on AITA is part of the problem. \n\nThe instant OP\u2019s son didn\u2019t react as OP expected is when OP should have stopped, reflected on the fact that ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE DIFFERENT AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW ANYONE ELSE IS THINKING AND FEELING BETTER THAN THEY THEMSELVES DO, and then shut up and apologized. \n\nLaughing was a horrible thing to do. Mocking the son by saying it\u2019s obvious was a horrible thing to do. And coming on AITA\u2014making it all about OP\u2014instead of going to apologize and listen, was another awful thing to do. \n\nOP\u2019s intent isn\u2019t the point. When you hurt someone you love, even unintentionally, you don\u2019t double down on whether your assumptions were justified under the circumstances. You go apologize to the person you love. \n\nBeing in the closet involves a lot of mental torture and agony and it\u2019s not ever just \u201cno big deal.\u201d Some straight people just assume oh well I\u2019m accepting and it\u2019s 2023 so therefore they should all just get over it.", "The bar is really fucking low, isn't it?", "She laughed at her kid when he panicked and insisted he was straight. That is not normalising coming out.\n\nIt absolutely should be the way you suggest, but it isn't. And society is still a long way off from that happening.", "What is a cishet?", "also known as....normalizing it!! Look at you and your logic!", "It was totally an A H reaction. But who among hasn\u2019t inappropriately laughed at human absurdity from time to time? Lol, been there.", "It is her child. This is so silly.", "Yes they do - but they do it by laughing with people, not at people.  Laughing *at* people when they\u2019re in a vulnerable situation is an AH move no matter what.", "I swear, it seems a large amount of commenters here never go outside and just talk to other people. I read so much bad takes that look like they were written by someone with zero EQ.", ">Because nobody is that dumb, right?\n\nSee, one problem with this approach is that apparently the OP's son *was* that foolish. So it becomes \"I am laughing at how stupid *you* are\" which is rude unless the other person is laughing too.", "Yeah, absolutely, if that's what your kid needs at the moment, you fucking do it. Why's that so hard?\n\nGay kids get disowned, sent off to be tortured at \"conversion therapy\" camp, some literally just disappear forever when they come out to their unsupportive parents. He was clearly terrified about what would happen and his own mother simply mocked him.", "Honestly OP's takeway should be that the kid's not exactly the brightest.", "Teenagers are sometimes stupid, more breaking news at 11.\n\nAs a parent you still need to talk through it with them and not laugh, because gay kid not comfortable coming out with parents can have real fears even if he is bad at hiding it.", "I\u2019m trying to put myself in OP\u2019s shoes. If the son was being so obvious about it, it would be really easy for a parent to take that as coming out without having to actually say the words. Just kind of like an unspoken understanding. I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s NOT what happened. But in a situation like that, from the son\u2019s perspective where he has the best of both worlds - gets to be himself, doesnt REALLY have to hide it that much, and is open with his parents but doesn\u2019t have to say anything - suddenly discussing it openly like that and finally confronting the unspoken could be very jarring and snap the reality he had created.", "How could she have known laughing in his face would make him feel bad? Kids often think they are being more clever/secretive than they actually are. My friends knew I was gay before I said anything, and I thought I was very careful. It was still terrifying regardless.", "It was an anti-gay slur for decades.", "This is like laughing because your kid says he didn\u2019t eat any cake but has icing all over his mouth. She is basically telling him that most people already knows he is gay and that he\u2019s not doing a great job hiding it.", "Right? He's not some hardened 40 year \n\nold incognito gay whonworked tirelessly\n\nevery second of his existence to hide it. \n\nBut I feel like there are a lot of those on\n\nhere projecting that narrative. Perhaps \n\nthey never got to say these things to \n\ntheir own parents. But this kid is gonna\n\nbe just fine. OP shouldn't have laughed \n\nand probably should've waited but there \n\nare sooo many worse outcomes???", "But is she though. I mean laughing twice, makes me wonder if she truly is. In the end this is not her truth to tell. She could have easily asked \"do you want to bring someone on the trip\" and left it open for him to make the decision.", "I have to disagree. I can see why you'd say N A H because it wasn't intended to be mean. However that's their kid and they laughed at something that's clearly a vulnerable topic. The only way theyd get N A H imo is if they had immediately apologized.", "With all due respect, are you LGBTQ+? Because I can tell you both from personal experience and talking to a lot of other folks that being outed against your will regardless of the circumstances is terrifying and pretty horrible. The kid is in a stage of life where he\u2019s figuring himself out, and maybe isn\u2019t done yet. But from his perspective, OP decided for him and took away the opportunity.\n\nBut even more importantly, assuming OP is in the US, things are more openly hostile towards queer people in the US than they have been in a long time. Teens aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019re aware of laws being passed targeting trans and other queer people. They see the rage that is directed toward the community. Even people who market themselves as progressive feminists openly hate trans people (mostly trans women), and we know damn well it isn\u2019t going to stop there. So even if it was clear to OP that they are accepting and safe, it is not necessarily clear to the son. And part of the coming out process is deciding to take a calculated risk of safety, which I cannot overstate, is terrifying. And it\u2019s not a reflection of OP, you quite literally don\u2019t know who you can trust, even, or especially, your parents. There\u2019s a reason LGBTQ homeless youth is such a problem in this country.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think the son was overreacting. Because there is a lot going on implicitly and under the surface constantly, but especially during the coming out process that you might not be aware of if you\u2019ve never been there. Shit, I\u2019m in my 30s, and every time I choose to come out to someone, I still go through the same process.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I think it\u2019s important that everyone, especially those who are wanting to be allies, understand it.", "wow, you\u2019re an asshole too", "Alll. Of.This. I'll add there is also some smugness around the OP thinking it isn't a big deal to be gay anymore. Guess what.. in high school and in a lot of circles it is. We may be in 2023 but there is still a lot of negative stigma around this. OP may be cool with it but when you are queer... you have no idea what reaction you are going to get out of anyone. Kid is still young too.. maybe he is bi. Maybe he doesn't want a label.  He definitely still has time to figure it out..", "The son could also be bi and confused, and not want to use the gay label in that instance if he is into both.", "This is the right take", "The initial laughter was understandable as she thought he was intentionally making a joke. Laughing more after he got his serious face on is an AH move. That should have been the indicator to take a step back, breathe, and work out where the misalignment came from.", "Yeah, but the parents are way ahead of the reveal here.", "I mean... He did lie. He said he was straight after OP asked if his very obvious boyfriend was going to be coming with. She's not saying he's a liar out of maliciousness though. If he wanted to keep the secrecy he probably shouldn't have made it super obvious and gotten mad that people who notice his strange behavior start piecing things together. Maybe OP should've kept it to herself but I've seen kids out there get mad because their parents didn't make a bigger deal about them being gay or bi or whatever because the parents had already known. And of course there's people who are like \"wait why was i so scared\"", "This. I came out to my mum at 27(?) and I knew she would love me regardless. I still felt sick to the pit of my stomach.", ">But every single teenager who comes out to their parents is doing it for the very very very first time, to the people who are responsible for their safety and survival.\n\nThis is so important. I think it's the biggest thing to remember.", "I came out as bi at 35 after the Pulse shooting. I had been married (still married to him actually) in a straight passing relationship for 4 years at that point nevermind all the years we dated before that. I had known for sure for 20 years at that point but I never felt the need to come out since my sexuality is mine alone and I was so secretive with who my relationships were with. I figured my relationships were no one's business but mine so I never talked about anyone I wasn't already serious about to anyone else in my life. I can count on one hand, and I don't need all the fingers, how many serious partners that is. \n\nAnd I dated a lot - A LOT - more than that. Especially after my first divorce and I wasn't sure if I wanted to settle down with anyone ever again. I just don't like everyone knowing my business. And no one said a thing about me coming out. Never got anything from anyone about it. Ever. Still hurts a bit. My family is incredibly liberal for the most part so I knew I would be fine. But I don't know if they figure it doesn't matter since I'm married or what. I still have no idea because no one talks about it.", "Someone who is both cisgender and heterosexual.", "Maybe, MAYBE a quickly concealed laugh is forgiveable, but continuing to laugh in his face as he expresses he fears about his father finding out is fucking awful.", "Yeah, they definitely could have handled that better, but I think it falls within a range of behavior in that instance that is understandable. Which to me means they're not an AH. How they recover from this will be telling though. If they double down and make it a family joke then that's AH territory. If they read through some of the responses here and come back with empathy then they're cool. \n\nAlso, if the kid was stupid about everything, it probably wouldn't have been that funny. Smart people can do stupid things, and it's really important for them to realize that early.", "The parents who asked him if he wants to bring his boyfriend in holiday aren\u2019t going to send him to a concentration camp.

But inside I always knew. And something about people telling me they knew and they were okay with me anyways, made it easier not harder to come out.", "I think the denying it is the key here and what makes OP the AH.\n Admittedly, my kids aren't in their teens but our kids know that they can love whoever they want as they grow (they have an uncle who is gay and lives with his partner) so I'm hoping that they won't feel the need to come out. Just to simply say, hey this is whoever and they are my whatever. Like not treating a relationship as inherently othered. I may be overly optimistic, but I'm hoping to let my kids know that they are accepted by me and their dad no matter what. \n\nIf my kids try to lie about something so obvious I'd probably laugh too at just the incredulous nature of it. I'd of course immediately apologize and explain that I was shocked and have clearly misread the situation (even if it is obvious like here).", "I'm aware of that, I guess I assumed it had been coopted by the community after the Q made it's way into the acronym.

The idea that we have to treat people differently. Rather than just being accepting and supportive of completely healthy preferences that humans sometimes have. The only 'renowned sensitivity' is the one that society places on it, by treating it differently.\n\nRacism for existence, wouldn't exist if people just stopped talking about it.

Sure he'll be embarassed for a few days, maybe a bit worried. But sometimes ripping the bandaid off just makes sense.

Doing anything under your parents noses in their house like that kinda warrants that reaction if you know that's not acceptable.\n\nWhether you're in the closet or you're out there's still a mutual respect to keep. OPs son had it made for 7 months while his parents knew he was in his bedroom canoodling with his boyfriend free of punishment, when a lot of parents would never be cool with that at all even if the son was straight. \n\nThis was also a lesson for the son in subtlety, if you want to learn how to pass you need to be aware of what you're doing that makes you obvious if you're concerned safety wise. It's a dance us LGBTQ people learn how to do, and you also learn to not give a fuck honestly over time. I've been out for over a decade, I could genuinely not give a fuck about what anyone says or thinks about me. You learn to be discreet when you want to be/have to be and part of that is what OP helped him to. \n\nCould you argue OP is an asshole?

Coming from a Black, Christian house my coming out story culminated in religious pressure that broke me as a person. I still refuse to leave anything my parents can use to glean information about my life around them because of how all of my writings,messages,friends,etc. were put through a filter after I came out.
