I laughed it off, said okay, and went about my day.  Within six months, I was questioning.  It took several more years before I was comfortably calling myself Bi and coming out to friends and family.    I think I must have given off vibes to my parents for Dad to come straight out and say it like that - but at no point in time did he assume, make comments alluding to, nothing.  I was given time and space to reach that conclusion on my own.\n\nYou took that away from your son.  Instead of saying something to the effect of \"If you are, cool - if not, cool.  We love you regardless\", you forced him to confront that identity before he was ready.\n\nYou need to stomp this shit out before it spirals.

If your child was afraid for you and his dad to find out, it's *your* fault for allowing him to believe that you might react poorly. And you proved him right by laughing at him and dismissing him in an extremely vulnerable moment. Do better.", "YTA. He wasn't ready to tell you yet.

If I\u2019m getting the vibe of you right, there was truly no need for him to \u201ccome out\u201d. My parents were the same. I was raised in a household with straight parents, but they were very vocal about their support of the queer community. I casually mentioned one day in my early 20\u2019s that I would be fine dating anybody I vibed with on the right level, regardless of gender labels, and nobody even batted an eye. My mom said she figured based on the closeness of some of my friendships she witnessed when I was younger that that was the case. I was in a very similar situation as OPs son and didn\u2019t realize it either. They knew, and all was well. I personally would have appreciated the laughter, as laughing at things breaks the tension in my parents household, which has molded me to love laughter as a coping mechanism when I\u2019m stressed. As long as the laughter wasn\u2019t malicious, I don\u2019t see the problem. I love the direction some of the world is heading in, where one doesn\u2019t need to necessarily \u201ccome out\u201d because it simply doesn\u2019t matter one way or the other to families. As long as your son knows he\u2019s valued and loved regardless of whom he dates as long as it\u2019s a healthy relationship, which I assuming based on the tone of the post that he does now, I don\u2019t see the problem. Sucks that he\u2019s (hopefully only) momentarily upset and feels like you \u201couted\u201d him before he was ready, but I see it as you doing him a favour.

Hopefully you can explain it right and smooth it all over with him. Good luck!", "YTA just for laughing.

People remain in the closet for a reason, and he very well may have been testing the waters to see if he COULD come out safely.

No way your the asshole. He started a full on relationship and than say he's not ready to come out? I bet all his friends and everyone else knows.

Sitting next to someone, having a talk in privacy, giving a gift or just taking a shower and styling your hair doesn't make someone gay.

He was just **super** obvious about the boyfriend thing. While it might've been better for his comfort that you continued to play along with the charade, you're accepting of him and his relationship and that's wonderful. I was also a very obvious fruit when I was younger, and when I did finally mention that I *might* be, my mom's response was fairly similar: I was very obvious with my attraction to *anybody*.

Coming out is a big deal and it should never be done on someone else's terms, or when *they* figure it's time. Your son wasn't ready and you forced him--so he denied it.

Of course anyone sane will assume he like boys with what was going on.

So he could be gay or bi or pan but she did not label him.\n\nAlso for the \"outing\" thing. To out someone requires them to be in closet as in not out. That boy was very much out of closet even if he did not know it himself. You cannot act like you are in a relationship and at the same time require everyone around you to be oblivious to it.

Well done.", "yeah, i find the dichotomy of people saying parents are the last to find out that there kids are gay is bullshit. Christ my best mate and his brothers and I knew his brother was gay at about 9 or 10. when he finally came out. It was like what took you so long? I think if your attentive to your kids you know. So he clearly hasnt come to terms with it. It must be a struggle for many gay people when society is clearly geared towards opposite sex. DOnt be so hard on yourself. Atleast he knows now 100% that you know. You need to kind of mention to him that his dad knows aswell. Then you can all discuss it together. Whats more important is that your willing to support him.", "YTA OP. If it was so obvious he was gay, you had plenty of time to research how to go about this. You are his parent.

How is straight still the default.", "YTA, you need to apologize and explain you made a mistake in trying to help him come out in a low pressure way.

Someone came out to me after I had known them and their partner for years, and we had been on trips together, and thought it would be a surprise because they'd always referred to them as a friend. I guess I was supposed to say something supportive but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, of course- I've known for 10 years. So i get your initial reaction. But then I sent a heartfelt email thanking them for telling me and sending my love and support. May I suggest doing so if they're not ready to talk to you.

I just wanted to meet them and know they are treating eachother with respect. Nothing else is my business. Then she spent an hour telling me about her crushes. Did I know before she said anything? Yeah, I'm her mom. You notice little things. But you dont bring attention anything till they do. This shit is confusing and hard enough as it is.", "ESH. It seems that your son was hoping for / expecting a grand coming out experience that was honestly never required. This is actually how it should be, family casually asking if the bf/gf is coming away with you without it being a big deal, your kid could have been grateful for that acceptance and missed the opportunity, however, the laughing was probably more than a little unnecessary. The irony is your kid had the family we all hope it will be, where it doesn\u2019t need to be an issue, he just didn\u2019t know he had that family. I\u2019ve alway asked my kids if they have a gf/bf so they know it won\u2019t matter in the future, sounds like your kid had no idea it would be accepted, if he should have known as you\u2019ve been open then I think he was a little dramatic.", "Nta", "YTA.\n\nYou abruptly confronted him with what you assume his sexuality to be, laughed when he was blindsided by it, and laughed even more when he got scared and tried to deny it.

From your description I'd say there's maybe an 85-90% chance they're dating, but as someone who has more than one friendship in that remaining 10-15%, it's rude to assume.

However he should apreciate that his parent knows and is comfortable enough that they could laugh thinking it was a happy moment and not a grim and tense moment.

She should\u2019ve never appoached it this way in the first place", "I mean she basically did especially when she laughed at him for being uncomfortable with her calling his friend a boyfriend and telling her he's straight. Everything else you said I agree with it, he may be bi, gay ace or pan or maybe exploring his gender identity too. Either way she violated his boundaries. I don't think she understands nuance of queerness and how important it is to let people have these conversations when they are ready.", "It's more about the fact she took away his agency.\n\nComing out is different to everyone and for the son, being able to have control over that was clearly important to him and she (albeit not maliciously) robbed him of that.\n\nIt doesn't matter that she was bang on the money beforehand, that both parents knew without him having to say. It's about the son coming to terms with who he is in a way that empowers and solidifies his identity and she just bulldozed all over that and then added insult to injury by laughing.", "OP stated that her son said he was upset about being outed? How is that not about the orientation? \n\nAlso, just because she is a parent doesn't mean she automatically knows all about how the world works? That is total bs. If that was the case, all the parents who abandon their children for coming out would never exist.\n\nAlso didn't demonise her. Just stated in my opinion, she didn't do well.", "we\u2019ll to me if you\u2019re supportive you aren\u2019t homophobic. and OP wasn\u2019t homophobic", "I always thought the reason for this is because parents and loved ones are not accepting. this is not the case here. We want to get to a point where coming out is not a big deal, but chastise people for not making it a big deal for their kids", "Yeah sure. Super abusive to laugh because your child is such a bad liar.\n\nPeople really need to get a grip on what they call abusive. There are people with real abusive parents. There are people who get shunned by their familys because they are gay. Misusing those words undermines abusive behaviour.", "You said the same thing an hour ago - We get it.", "I get it, some people really empathise with the mum. It is objectively funny. But as a parent, you should try to empathise with your child, and it was clear from her own description that he felt uncomfortable and upset. She laughed harder at his awkwardness. If you ever feel 'put on the spot' and someone laughs at you, it makes you feel worse. When he said to her that he wasn't ready for the coming out conversation, she should have apologised for not handling it very well. For him, it must have been embarrassing finding out that he was presenting as gay unintentionally. By her own admission he is 'straight presenting' so he could have been trying to stay in the closet until he figured out how to come out. He just couldn't so easily hide his feelings for his partner.", "Wow.  It cut so deep.  How will I ever survive?", "Wdym it isn\u2019t safe, both parents know he\u2019s gay. If it wasn\u2019t a safe environment they would\u2019ve had some sort of screaming match or kicking the son out for being gay. They already knew. Nobody gets mad when a guy obvious has a girlfriend and hasn\u2019t told anyone yet. And then their parents ask about it they don\u2019t get defensive and serious. Because it was obvious. Probably the safest environment for someone who is gay to be in, is in a home where the parents don\u2019t care. Because it isn\u2019t special. To that person it may be, but to everyone it\u2019s normal to fall in love with someone.", "Yup, this looks like a pretty solid hint", "Sure if OP hadn\u2019t seen him clearly having a bf. I mean at that point they thought he was joking. Idk, I can see how the situation got to this point purely on both parties not communicating and misinterpreting stuff. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole.", "It didn't look like op said you're gay.  More like you have a boyfriend and it's obvious.", "Well she certainly knows more about life her minor son. The fact that the situation is about orientation is THIS particular situation.

They should talk openly to their son about it. But in my mind society is the only AH here.", "It really depends on the kid. OP's son makes it clear that it was a big deal for him (what with him being secretive about it), so OP should've handled it accordingly. Many of us don't know how our parents are gonna react when we come out.

I was absolutely fucking terrified. Despite knowing my mom for my entire life and knowing that she was a good person, who'd spent a fair portion of her adulthood before having me attending pride parades with her queer friends.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause there is always the chance of rejection. No matter how certain you are about a person, there is always a chance you are wrong.\n\nSo yeah, it isn't safe for LGBTQ+ people still. Just look at the world around us and think for a moment, at how it must feel to watch people try and pass legislation that will mean further deaths. Just think how it feels to know that there are literal lists being written and expanded nearly every damn day, documenting the people in the community that have died. Sure, progress has been made. But it's nowhere near enough to call the world safe.", "So why did she need to double down? Why did she *have* to be right?", "The only thing tho is that we weren\u2019t there to witness we just assume the worst due to the society we live in.

Nobody is trying to pass laws that make it harder for straight people to prosper, start families. \n\nIt is not the same thing at all and you should know better.", "Exactly. I never had to come out as straight. Why should LGB people have to come out?", "YTA, what might have been obvious to you obviously wasn't obvious to him. The first laugh was understandable, but to keep laughing at him after he clearly showed an insecurity about his sexuality makes you an asshole. And the fact that he reacted that way to the first laugh and he tried to reaffirm his \"straightness\" tells me that he doesn't trust you nor the father enough to come out himself. \n\nAnd for the queer people saying that you wish your parents reacted that way and he should get over himself because you would have preferred ops reaction. NOT EVERY GAY PERSON IS THE SAME. Get over yourselves.", "NTA \nYour son isn't mad about not being able to choose when to come out.  He just thought he was hiding it really well and now is embarrassed.  This has nothing to do with being gay but just kids thinking they're being sneaky.  I've had tons of friends hide being gay for years and years but everyone knew from day 1.  Then after they finally came out they wished they hadn't wasted all that time because they were afraid.  Most told me that they wished I had said something to them earlier.  \nSometimes we need a bit of a push because we're scared to be who we are.  Maybe laughing wasn't great but it wasn't the worst reaction either. Do not dwell on this.  It's better for him to be who he is and not hide it.  Hiding who you are is like denying yourself what makes you happy.  Only depression and sadness comes from that. He'll get over it and be happy it happened", "NTA, just give him his time he will be fine...", "NTA. Maybe laughing wasn\u2019t the best approach, but you\u2019re clearly treating this as a normal thing (like it should be) and that\u2019s great, and you\u2019ve shown you not only accept him as gay/bi but you want to include his boyfriend in your activities. It\u2019s pretty apparent that he reacted out of fear of rejection when he asked you not to tell his father, which is pretty heartbreaking. If you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d think through how you would break it to him that his father already knows, even though saying \u201che already knows\u201d seems so simple and causal, I think your son has really nailed it into his head that him coming out could exile him. Maybe you and the dad or just the dad should talk to him later privately and explain everything and reassure him that you are 100% fine with whoever he is", "NTA\n\nLook, I understand the importance of not outing someone before they are ready, but someone needs to actually be in the closet for that to apply.

He obviously has loving parents who are accepting and don\u2019t care as long as he is happy. Why wouldn\u2019t he want that? Would you all rather the parents get mad and tell him they can\u2019t hang out anymore? What she did is typical parenting and nothing else..

OP did their son a favor, because now their son doesn't need to be anxious about coming out. And OP isn't an AH for laughing, either.

And she should absolutely take your advice above going forward. That doesn\u2019t make her an asshole though.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly zero intent to be mean here.  Her laughing was just a natural reaction at how oblivious her son was.  If you don\u2019t want people to laugh at you, don\u2019t openly date a guy for 6 months and then scream to high heaven that you\u2019re straight.  Ffs that is baffling and an idiot teenager thing.

This isn\u2019t him sneakily looking at guy\u2019s abs or not even glancing at girls. He is obviously not straight. He knows he\u2019s not straight. He just hadn\u2019t told his parents yet.", "I don\u2019t think the OP laughed at her son, but instead laughed at the ridiculousness of his lie.", "Agreed. Reactions like this- along with basic lack of trust- is why my mother didn't find out I was Bi until I was 29, almost 30. \n\nGreat job, OP, intended or not, that interaction definitely has your son questioning you and his trust in you. I really do hope your relationship has a solid foundation and that this didn't just sink a nail in its coffin.", "Agreed (and also a member of the queer community here). IMO the laughing was not laughing at him, it is basically laughing at the situation - it has been extremely obvious and to some extent OP's son must have been comfortable enough to be openly hugging, snuggling and basically quite openly dating this boy without explicitly saying 'I am gay'.\n\nOP was basically saying 'I know, it's okay.' It possibly could have been worded a bit better (e.g. 'you know I accept you however you are, and I notice that X is very special to you...'). Idk if it might be a cultural difference but I'm from the UK and this lightheartedness and laughter is not outside the ordinary for how people would react and I'm a bit shocked at the other comments acting like OP is belittling their child.\n\nI think the best thing OP can do now just to clear the air is to say I'm sorry I laughed, I just want you to know I love and accept you and I am happy you feel comfortable here. It can be very scary coming out, and he might have been expecting it to be taken in a different way and being a 'bigger thing' and is instead very taken aback that everyone seems to already know.", "It\u2019s not abusive, etc. - but could have been handled a lot better by OP. I\u2019m just remembering that sort of intense sensitivity as a teenager about romantic relationships, perhaps more so as a queer child. \n\nOP didn\u2019t react with any tenderness or kindness; they laughed. \n\nThat to me is where AH territory was entered. Could have initially laughed if unavoidable and then just said \u201cI\u2019m sorry honey, you two seemed so close to each other, and I just assumed. He\u2019s welcome to join us as your friend, of course. I love you very much!\u201d", "Gay man here, in agreement. I understand that there are good and bad ways to react to a coming out. I also understand that it\u2019s considered rude to out someone. However, the son outed himself. Did the mom say the perfect things? No. But she\u2019s clearly unbothered and supportive. Having this conversation, awkward as it may be, is the first step to the song being comfortable being openly out with his boyfriend. NAH. \n\nIt really does shock me the number of people who think they can be in a gay relationship and manage to keep it secret from everyone around them, and then get offended when people realize they\u2019re gay. I\u2019m having flashbacks to dating closeted boys in college.", "As a gay man, if this is how my mom had handled 'the talk', I would've never forgiven her. Your experiences and opinions are not universal, you don't get to decide whether or not someone else's actions are \"okay\" based on how you yourself would react.\n\nShe said herself that her son was not ready to have this conversation and the whole reason he's not talking to her is because she essentially forced it. I didn't get to choose when I got to come out either (pressured into it by my then-boyfriend's mom) and I will always carry resentment over that. But at least my mom's reaction was just making sure I knew it wasn't a big deal to her and that she still loved me, not her having several laughing fits during the most vulnerable sit-down of my life.", "I agree but think she\u2019s the ah for laughing. Not so much at this situation but as a \u201cread the room\u201d vibe. If someone made a comment about a dead person, and someone wasn\u2019t paying attention and laughed because they thought It was a joke, people would still be upset. Just read the room and understand it wasn\u2019t time for funnies. But I don\u2019t think anything else that happened was wrong and he shouldn\u2019t be ignoring her.", ">Why would you be an AH for treating him and his boyfriend the same way?\n\nThis is the problem. Yes, our GOAL is to get there on a social level. The goal will be reached (I have faith in that) and sooner or later queer people themselves will be the ones to perceive that we are getting there. \n\nAs of now, however, it isn't. So: parents dismissing all the emotional and complicated fears of coming out is a problem. A big problem, for someone. You can't just bypass that being queer and being straight isn't the same; it's the reality (for now). A family should treat them with the same respect and love, help them, but \"same respect and love\" isn't necessarily \"the same way\". \"The same way\" erases the differences and emotional distress. The way you would laugh about a boy saying \"noo she totally isn't my girlfriend\" can't be replicated without sounding dumb or mean for a boy hiding to have a boyfriend; they aren't the same, the reasons, emotional distress and fears aren't remotely the same.\n\nThere absolutely is a way to be supportive and creating a safe environment at home that also respects the fact that socially, queer people live a totally different life and you can't act like you live in an alternative reality \"detaching\" your house from the actual society. The queer son can't split himself in two parts: he lives in society and not just in the house, so it's pointless to act like that and not recognizing and respecting the difference and how it impacts their way of living their love, including presenting the partners. There is a better way to be supportive which isn't consisting of blindly ignoring the material reality.", "I agree. Yes laughing at him was being the AH. But including him and his bf on a trip like it was completely normal was appropriate, welcoming, accepting thing do do. Yes he probably was caught off guard at first if he didn't think anyone knew, but I'm sure that him feeling they were both welcome and that it was a big deal was important to him.  If we all want to be treated the same why does it have to be some big dramatic thing. That would never be the case for a hetero relationship.", "Not to mention the fact that if he is out to his friend group then the only people in his life that he isn't out to are his parents who clearly don't have a problem with.  If he isn't out to his friends group but his parents are picking up on it then his friend group is at the very least suspicious.\n\nI mean I think as teens we can all remember the gay or straight couple that were hooking up but constantly telling everyone they were \"just friends\" and the cuddles were \"strictly platonic\".  Everyone knew they were bangin' but they were convinced they had the room fooled.", "Yes. The laughing I\u2019m sure hurt him in the moment but it wasn\u2019t malicious like people here are making it out to be. I don\u2019t understand how you could read this and think OP isn\u2019t supportive of it by asking if the boy is coming on the trip.

OP is well aware her son is dating this boy, I understand why the first reaction would be to laugh and assume it\u2019s a joke.

The same happens when someone laughs at the death of a loved one (even though they feel a lot of pain) or in uncomfortable situations where they don't know how to act.  It is what it is.  However, with OP, the laugh is because she doesn't see any problem and wants to downplay the matter, the same would happen if he had a \"hidden\" girlfriend.  The funny thing is not his sexuality, the funny thing is that he tried to hide his OBVIOUS partner from him under the parents' noses.  Logically if you treat someone as your partner is what your parents will think, that boy was not being discreet at all.  Also as a comment he says above:\n\n\u201c- If he is soooo obvious in front of you guys and he is clueless about how clear his actions are\u2026 THAT is going to be dangerous for him in the wrong setting.\n\nIf he wanted to hide it, it\u2019s better for him to hear he did a terrible job hiding it while in a safe space.
