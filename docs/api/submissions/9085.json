It took several more years before I was comfortably calling myself Bi and coming out to friends and family.

I was given time and space to reach that conclusion on my own.\n\nYou took that away from your son.  Instead of saying something to the effect of \"If you are, cool - if not, cool.  We love you regardless\", you forced him to confront that identity before he was ready.\n\nYou need to stomp this shit out before it spirals.

If your child was afraid for you and his dad to find out, it's *your* fault for allowing him to believe that you might react poorly. And you proved him right by laughing at him and dismissing him in an extremely vulnerable moment. Do better.", "YTA. He wasn't ready to tell you yet.

If I\u2019m getting the vibe of you right, there was truly no need for him to \u201ccome out\u201d. My parents were the same. I was raised in a household with straight parents, but they were very vocal about their support of the queer community. I casually mentioned one day in my early 20\u2019s that I would be fine dating anybody I vibed with on the right level, regardless of gender labels, and nobody even batted an eye. My mom said she figured based on the closeness of some of my friendships she witnessed when I was younger that that was the case. I was in a very similar situation as OPs son and didn\u2019t realize it either. They knew, and all was well. I personally would have appreciated the laughter, as laughing at things breaks the tension in my parents household, which has molded me to love laughter as a coping mechanism when I\u2019m stressed. As long as the laughter wasn\u2019t malicious, I don\u2019t see the problem. I love the direction some of the world is heading in, where one doesn\u2019t need to necessarily \u201ccome out\u201d because it simply doesn\u2019t matter one way or the other to families. As long as your son knows he\u2019s valued and loved regardless of whom he dates as long as it\u2019s a healthy relationship, which I assuming based on the tone of the post that he does now, I don\u2019t see the problem. Sucks that he\u2019s (hopefully only) momentarily upset and feels like you \u201couted\u201d him before he was ready, but I see it as you doing him a favour.

Hopefully you can explain it right and smooth it all over with him. Good luck!", "YTA just for laughing.

People remain in the closet for a reason, and he very well may have been testing the waters to see if he COULD come out safely.

No way your the asshole. He started a full on relationship and than say he's not ready to come out? I bet all his friends and everyone else knows.

He'll be fine and happy he's out.", "YTA\n\nThere is nothing in OP's description of the situation that would suggest her son is gay or he is dating his friend. OP just made up her mind that he is and thinks normal things people do are suddenly signs of romance. Sitting next to someone, having a talk in privacy, giving a gift or just taking a shower and styling your hair doesn't make someone gay.

He was just **super** obvious about the boyfriend thing. While it might've been better for his comfort that you continued to play along with the charade, you're accepting of him and his relationship and that's wonderful. I was also a very obvious fruit when I was younger, and when I did finally mention that I *might* be, my mom's response was fairly similar: I was very obvious with my attraction to *anybody*.

Why do gay people have to come out when straight people don\u2019t? Gay, lesbian, queer, non-binary, trans, etc people should just be treated like they\u2019re supposed to exist.

For the street cred: I'm bi.   \nAlthough they are right that you probably can't fully understand because you've not been in this exact situation we as humans can still relate experiences of others to our own and infer how we'd feel in those situations.   \nAlso it's a really personal thing. Like people have different reactions to the same event/situation.   \nAnd although it is always nice if people are open minded and listening to other peoples experiences this implied \"I speak for all queer people and if I as a queer person think you are wrong you are definitely wrong\" attitude is really helping nobody, quite the opposite, I think it can be harmful.", "you can have an opinion, but unless you ARE part of the community, you DO NOT understand all of the internal stuff that comes before coming out.  this isn't gatekeeping; it is simply an experience you do not have.", "Oh wow. No, you absolutely cannot fully understand. You can learn and empathize but you cannot understand. The fact that a queer person telling you this makes you angry, means you have some learning to do.

And if you\u2019re getting this argument enough that it\u2019s \u201cagain\u201d then maybe you should spend some time listening to the people who keep telling you that you\u2019re not getting it. Maybe consider whether or not you\u2019re actually missing something, if people keep saying to you that you are.\n \nIn this case?
