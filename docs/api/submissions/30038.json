She's amazing and loves her daddy. It was his birthday on Monday so I let my daughter grab some bits for him.\n\nTheres a football stall in our local shopping centre. They had squeezy balls for each team. My daughter knows that her dad loves football and also the colour blue, so she picked out a blue one for him. I knew it wasn't his team but theres nothing on the actual ball, it just said the team on the wrapper.\n\nShe bought it, we left, everything got wrapped up. \n\nWe were with him when he opened them. His face fell and he dropped the ball like it burned him when he opened it. His mum gave him the evil eyes so he did the clearly fake \"thank you\" and then our daughter was disinterested. \n\nHe was off with me the whole day and last night called me a bitch for \"doing that\" to him. I asked what he meant, he said I knew he hates that team (I didn't - I used to ignore his football rants) and that he thinks its shitty that I used our daughter as an excuse to upset him.\n\nI explained that she picked it out and he claimed I should have corrected her because he hates the gift.\n\nI called him a child. His mum has since text me apologising but in a \"even though its your fault\" way. She's usually on my side so now I'm half thinking its my fault in some sorta way.\n\nI did know he doesn't support that team and my daughter would have been corrected easily, so I probably should have done it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698758038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kkris/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_buy_her_dad_a_gift/", "score": 5253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see why he's your ex. What kind of psycho gets so angry about a squishy football picked out by their 3 YEAR OLD. Does he not understand that she's a toddler? The fact of the matter is SHE wanted to pick it you, SHE got it for him because he likes football and the color blue. Who gives a flying fart in space the team? She obviously doesn't. \n\nYour ex needs to do some work on himself if he can't see the gesture from his own daughter. I'd hate to see what happens when she's older and get something he doesn't \"approve\" of. Utterly ridiculous for a grown adult to act that way towards their child.", "NTA\n\n3 year old just wanted a football and a color that she knew daddy liked.  \n\nDaddy has anger management problems if he can't grin and bear  it for a 3 year old.", "NTA. Who says they 'hate' a gift, let alone one picked out by a three year old?\n\nSure, some football fans can be pretty intense in their hatred for rival football teams, so it doesn't hugely surprise me that he saw this as an attempt to upset him.\n\nBut he's not your partner \u2013 he's *her* dad, so letting your daughter choose the gifts was reasonably a higher priority to you than anticipating a grown man would be upset by the *wrapper* on a toy.", "I think there must be something I'm not getting here.  Why would he automatically assume that you're using your daughter as \"an excuse to upset him\"?", "NTA. I'm a true blue Leafs fan. If my little one bought me a little hockey item because it's my favourite colour I'd happily display it on my memorabilia shelf. Even if it was Habs, Bruins or God forbid, Canucks. Unless the choice of gift is inappropriate, don't interfere when a child is picking a gift. Jesus, your ex needs to grow up and your kid was just being thoughtful.", "ESH - he's immature for the way he reacted, but...  how hard would it have been to say \"honey thats a great idea for daddy, but let's pick the ball that is for his favorite team!\".", "NTA. Your daughter put a lot of thought into the gift that she chose and telling her different would have been detrimental. People who are expecting gifts they actually like from a flipping toddler are clearly not ready to parent. Hate that for the both of you.", "(I'm assuming by the language that you are potentially from the UK.)\n\nBeing a football fan raised by a football fan, ESH. These colours might seem entirely meaningless but to die hard fans they mean something. These are old long standing rivalries, issues with religion and traumatic events. For example, you don't buy a Celtic fan a Rangers ball because there is a lot of actual hate there not just rivalry. I know it is stupid but it has become part of the sport now.\n\nYou could have easily pointed your daughter to a different ball and he could have acted like an adult about it.", "Just don\u2019t buy him anything for his birthday. Problem solved.", "Sorry, against others opinions, YTA, but not for allowing your daughter to pick that out for him but because you knew better and seemingly did nothing to change your daughter\u2019s mind, and you did it out of spite and evil intent, and you know it. \n\nBasically, you used her to dig at your ex. \n\nHe was a jerk for his reaction, but you chose to not be the better person. \n\nThe others\u2019 comments probably don\u2019t have a team that they are ardent fans of so they don\u2019t have perspective. \n\nYes, a child\u2019s love is way more important, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that you chose to use this opportunity, and your daughter, to get a reaction out of her father.  \n\nI hope you grow from this.  It was immature, and you will probably realize it when you get older.  \n\nTo add, it was also totally disrespectful to your ex.   I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done things to you as well, but in this case you used your (plural) daughter, and that is the shameful part.", "\\>she picked out a blue one for him. I knew it wasn't his team\n\n\\>I let my daughter get her dad a gift I knew he'd dislike. \n\nYTA I almost said E S H but as much as I think it's pathetic to care about whether a ball that is a present from your daughter represents the team you like or not, I think this is really about you knowingly letting your daughter choose that ball. I don't believe for a second that you didn't realize how this would play out -- with him realizing this was your dig at him as you knew his team and how rabid a supporter he is. You knew it would get under his skin.\n\nYou had an opportunity to direct her to his team's ball, but chose to allow your daughter to get a poisoned gift for him, knowing that he had to accept it with a shit-eating grin for his daughter's sake even knowing you'd messed with him, or let your daughter down and look like a jerk. \n\nYou risked ruining the moment that was your innocent daughter wanting to make her father happy and that was wrong even just for the fact that it could have gone far worse and ended up with your daughter being really upset thinking that her father was rejecting \\*her.\\*", "My 3 year old wrapped up a half eaten apple squished together with a Spiderman lego, in toilet paper and then gifted it to me yesterday.  lol\n\nI took the gift with the love it was meant.", "ESH. He absolutely shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way, but if you *knew* it wasn\u2019t his team why not just redirect your daughter and tell her \u201ceven though daddy love blue, his favorite team wears (colors) and I bet he\u2019d love *this one* even more.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the bigger AH for sure, but it feels like common sense to not let your kid pick out a sports themed item if you know what team he actually likes.", "Info: Did you even try and redirect your daughter to a football from the team he likes? I feel like most 3 year olds would have no problem with being told \"not this one, the other one is even better for daddy\", and then the kid can still have the same amount of fun giving the gift to her dad. But at the same time if the kid was really focused on this one football, and for some reason was really determined to get THAT one for her dad, I could understand just letting it go as well. Ultimately this is really low stakes stuff, and it does sound like he pretended to like it for his daughter when she gave it to him, at least to the point where it seems from your story that your daughter didn't notice any negative reaction from him.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t really get all the NTAs here. Except most of them think it\u2019s ridiculous to be so passionate about sports. I \ud83d\udcaf% agree with that sentiment. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nBut OP already knew how passionate her ex was about football and, most definitely, knew he\u2019d be pissed with a gift from his rival\u2019s football team. You can argue OP\u2019s ex\u2019s reaction was over the top (because it was), but **OP knew exactly how her ex would react**. That\u2019s why she bought the gift in the first place - to poke the bear.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201creally\u201d a precious gift from a 3 year old - it\u2019s a gift OP bought, knowing it was for a completely different team. OP could\u2019ve easily told her daughter that\u2019s a different team and showed the 3 year old merch for her ex\u2019s team. But she deliberately did not. \n\nAnd now OP comes here whining about how her ex got upset and rejected a precious gift from his daughter. Bullshit - he rejected a deliberately malice gift from his ex that could\u2019ve been trivially avoided.\n\nI would\u2019ve gone with E S H as the ex\u2019s reaction is absurd, but OP knew he would lose his shit and deliberately chose to use her daughter to piss off her ex. Shame on OP.\n\nEdit: minor correction.", "I really want to go N T A because he should be able to gratefully accept a gift, especially from a three year old and especially from his daughter.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping me is the tone and message of this post. You didn\u2019t take the extra second to direct your daughter to a more thoughtful gift and using it as a general teaching moment. You belittle and dismiss his interests as unimportant and silly, and while I have no doubt that is because of his irrational attachment to his team it comes across as dismissing all people who enjoy such things as being ridiculous.\n\nYou know your ex enjoys supporting a certain team. You also likely know he\u2019s not the best at being grateful or managing his emotions. Why put your daughter in the line of fire when she doesn\u2019t have to be? Why not protect her?\n\nThis all comes across as you wanting to poke at your ex a little and being surprised at him reacting like you were poking a lot. \n\nRegardless of how big or small you the message you want to send, please don\u2019t use your daughter or send it in the future.\n\nESH.", "This reminds me of when I was a kid and got my dad a birthday gift with my own money. I was so happy and proud of myself. He was a Ford fan, die hard and I bought him a shirt with a Chevy logo on it. I thought it was the one he liked. I clearly remember that he was not happy about it and told me so. I must have been about five or six. I'm 43 now. It's funny the things that stick with you.", "ESH\nI would hate a present if I got merchandise that was the my teams rival.

Its a gift from his daughter, obviously she doesn't know, she's just happy to get something for her dad. It wont physically hurt him to hold memorabilia from the rival team. \n\nYou're the AH for giving zero fucks about a present. I feel like you should know enough about sports fandom that if you're going to get someone a sports related gift, you get the team they root for. Your daughter isn't going to know, so I feel like a gentle correction is appropriate. Like why wouldn't you want your daughter to give a gift that the recipient would enjoy? Its like all you care about is that your daughter is happy to get a gift for her dad, but you don't care about her connecting with her dad. Maybe there's some bitterness, maybe thats fair, but if you don't respect the relationship she has with her dad, its going to drive a wedge between you and her when she gets older.", "YTA, like other comments have said, you set your daughter up to fail knowing exactly what her father's reaction would be and now you're attempting to using it as ammunition. I can see why _you're his_ ex", "YTA\n\nI say this because you set your daughter up for disappointment and put your hubby in an awkward position.  And you wasted money on something no one wants.  And you did all this on purpose.  \n\nHow hard would it have been to explain to her about \"Daddy's favorite team\"?

She picked out a pair of fake diamond dangly earrings - the furthest thing from what I\u2019d ever wear. I wore them on Christmas Day feeling like a fool because she had picked them out. I still have them and treasure them! It would never have occurred to me to be angry at my husband for letting her pick out something he knew I wouldn\u2019t like. Your ex is TA. He expects to be coddled like a child. Consider yourself lucky he\u2019s your ex.", "Wtf? If my little girl gave me any kind of present that she picked out for me, I would melt. And it sounds like you paid for it too. It doesn't matter what the present is, its a 3 year old girl. Also what kind of person hates a football team so much?

I'm in shock people are defending this man's behaviour. The dramatic dropping of the ball because its not his favourite team? That is honestly ridiculous. There's no excuse to not accepting and loving your child's gifts with so much effort put in because THEY THOUGHT OF YOU, THEY LOVE YOU ENOUGH TO THINK OF YOU. When i was younger I bought my nan a candle stick holder as an ash tray but she still loved it and used it because its the thought that counts.

I miss him every day and it breaks my heart that OP\u2019s kid doesn\u2019t get to grow up with a dad like that.", "Hockey fan here and I totally agree. Fans can like and dislike teams for whatever reason. I still watch the rival teams games and sometimes get a little frustrated but it doesnt ruin my day. I was gifted a rival team tshirt. Guess what... I wear it and the world hasn't exploded yet. All the ridiculous hatred should disappear when the game is over. For me, and prob most fans, hockey teams don't affect my life. While its great to have something as part of your personality, it shouldn't consume you.This guy is like the others that lost their own selves, to a sport that doesn't affect real life. Shouldn't anyway. As much as some over the top fans don't want to admit it, sports are entertainment.\n\nSorry. IDK. This guy just blows my mind.", "Green is my favorite color, I'd get murdered and have no idea why lol.", "I'm not a football fanatic, but if someone bought me merchandise from a different team to the one I support, I would think it was weird and potentially catty. I wouldn't have made as big of a deal of it as him, but it would definitely feel weird to me if a friend's child gave me a box with a rival team's logo on it.", "Did you not read the OP where they say explicitly \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t his team\u201d?", "To be honest, whether the reaction is even too much depends. If letting her get a gift she knew would upset him on purpose seems like something she would do and he thinks she intentionally used their daughter to try and hurt him, and *maybe* even was trying to get a reaction out of him that would turn their daughter against him for a while? His reaction isn't uncalled for at all, because he wasn't mad about the ball: he was mad about the sheer audacity of what was happening.\n\nOn the other hand, if she doesn't have a history of being manipulative like that and he's just getting worked up over an imagined slight then yes, they're both assholes.", "Yes - typo. Thanks.", "That\u2019s a real asshole thing to do, not going to lie. \n\nMy son and I have started to bond over our football team, I\u2019m going to take him to a match soon, he can\u2019t wait and is super excited. \n\nOne of the closest bonds I had with my father was sport. I see loads of multi-generational families who now all go together at our club. I know fathers and sons who\u2019ve been going together now for as long as 40-50 years.\n\nI\u2019d be furious if my in-laws thought it was funny to try to influence my kid like that.", "Abso fucking louteley. Like- let's just buy highly Mormon guy some scientology merch and say happy fucking Christmas- 'oh youre not happy even though I knew it was the wrong faith. *You* are a child.' \n\nHonestly I don't know what goes through people's minds.", "Ding ding ding\n\nAnd she got caught doing it.\n\nOn top of that she\u2019s so petty that she\u2019s going to Reddit for emotional support.", "And then made this point to try to convince a bunch of strangers to validate her actions through plausible deniability.\n\nVery manipulative.", "Re read the post, he didn't take it out on the child, OP just said he looked a bit annoyed nut he said thank you. What I imagine was going through the exes head in that moment was \"is she really trying to piss me off using our daughter?\". OP clearly knew he wasn't going to like the gift, the line about never listening to his football rants implies he would speak about it often, this indicates that she knows he is very passionate about his club, I also believe despite what she said that she knew which clubs she hated.", "I know people who how their team does affects their entire mood for the weekend. Football teams aren\u2019t entertainment in England they are things you belong to. I don\u2019t think this translates either to other cultures sports or people who don\u2019t support a club. People get very emotional about football and that includes anger.", "That's what my dad did all throughout my childhood. Tried to say my mom was poisoning me against him, but she wasn't, it was actually him trying that. He failed miserably and now we're no contact.", "I could almost guarantee that he won\u2019t ever be bringing his daughter to get a birthday gift for mom any time soon. NTA, OP.", "Yep, my ex-wife was always worried I was cheating on her. Turns out she was cheating on me many many times with many many men since before we were married.", "Quite likely.", "Wow that's reading an awful lot into a single interaction as relayed to you from one side.", "Exactly, he can exchange it\u2026, but probably he\u2019s too immature to even ask to do that\u2026", "this hurts my heart for the kid!!!!!!", "Dad is prolly Arsenal and got Spurs", "But OP knew and still had the kid buy it. The kid is 3. All you have to say is that\u2019s a great idea but let\u2019s get this one instead. Instead OP knowingly go the wrong one knowing he wouldn\u2019t like it. Obviously OP\u2019s ex is going to blame the person who bought it.", "I\u2019ll be honest those soft indoor balls with premier league team logos and colours on are everywhere in the UK, I\u2019ve never seen a blank coloured one that didn\u2019t at least have the team\u2019s name on it. Unless it was one of those unofficial ones that market type stalls in shopping centres sometimes sell, but even their fakes tend to have team logos printed on.", "Heaven forbid a man express sadness", "That\u2019s not what OP said. She claimed his mother gave him a look. I call BS on that. She has no idea if that\u2019s the case and if he saw it. EXs mom could have been making a face because she just watched her sons ex weaponsize a gift from his daughter.", "How are you and your dad now? Being a single parent dad must be tough as hell. I have a couple about that age, I'm not a single parent, and I still feel overwhelmed very often. I hope I'm not throwing tantrums, but I'm not always proud of the parenting decisions I make. And I worry about the relationship we'll have a couple decades from now", "I'd recommend a list of museums, theaters, and cultural attractions in Cleveland, but Noah doesn't seem like the sort to enjoy using his brain.", "That's because she did. She knew it wasn't his team and that he wouldn't like the gift.", "She even had the right idea, she knew her dad liked Blue. She didn't like blue, she didn't get it because she wanted a blue ball. She got it because she thought her dad would like it.\n\nI have no doubt she would have instantly understood if her mom explained that her dad *liked his team even more than he liked blue*.", "Would you wear the Man U shirt/jersey that you receive as gift? Wouldn't you be upset at the person who allows a kid to buy you a Man U shirt?\n\nWould a Liverpool fan wear the Man U jersey, just because both are red?", "It's not just the UK.\n\nI'm from France and we have a pretty big rivalry with our neighbour. One time we slaughtered them 5-0 in their stadium. The game was interrupted twice, including once where their fans invaded the field to try to attack our players and had to be stopped by a line of riot police. \n\nI once went to a game against them and the riot police was dosing them with anti riot water canon before the game had begun.\n\nNow they're not allowed in our stadium and we're not allowed in them. \n\nWhich seems like overkill now that those losers are in second division.", "Good for you, well done.", "We had a rough time of it, for most of my life. I had issues of my own, of course.\n\nHe provided well enough, food on the table and tuition paid, etc. The dysfunction, gaslighting, verbal abuse and psychological manipulation were bizarre; however, he himself was a victim of that as a kid.\n\nEventually, in my early 40s, I\u2019d had enough of his regular gaslighting attempts and narcissistic \u201cyou don\u2019t love me; I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so angry with me\u201d spirals that I cut him off. Tough to do when we are each other\u2019s only close blood relatives.\n\nI was essentially no contact with him for a few months, then got back in touch when an old friend of mine died. Since that day that I got back in touch, there\u2019s not a hint of that old emotional/psychological abuse there. Something clearly changed in him during that no contact period.\n\nWe started talking every day. We\u2019re extremely close now.\n\nWith your level of self-awareness, I doubt you\u2019ll have a similar trajectory.", "Or make it a project and have her help you paint over the logo with your actual teams logo. Or even print it, cut it out, and tape it on together and tell her about your team. \n\nI'm pretty passionate about my teams and would be a little disgusted seeing their rivals merchandise around, but if my son picked it out I'd use it as a bonding experience to teach him about the sport and my favorite team. I sure as hell wouldn't be a prick about it to his mom", "OP literally confirmed the exact opposite.", "This is actually a pretty good call out.", "An unreliable narrator is definitely what I would label OP. I'm not a sports fan but I still know what teams from certain family members like, and wouldn't get them a gift of team they don't like even hate unless I was being petty and trying to stir up trouble. But I'm not that petty.", "I feel that there are very very significant omissions.", "Especially considering the blue team is likely Chelsea, Everton or Man City. Teams with extremely bitter rivals that you would have to be unbelievably ignorant of sport to not realise.", ">3 year olds do not have purchasing autonomy.\n\nYour right.  The mother made the child pick a toy.  She didn't take her to the knife section or cleaning products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When a gift is given from a child, it is assumed that the parent has bought it on their behalf\n\nNot when it's a toy... You're thinking of when a mother gives a new shirt or something.  When a kid is given $5 to pick something for their dad, it's them picking.  You get whatever random thing you get. It's not an investment, it's just the child choosing something they think would be special.\n\nIt's okay to let a 3 year old think you love something even if you have no use for it. Or even if you don't like it. \n\nI know I have.", "Super extra special AH if he's a Celtic fan and it was a Rangers ball."]}
