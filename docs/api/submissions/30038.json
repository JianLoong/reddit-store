She's amazing and loves her daddy. It was his birthday on Monday so I let my daughter grab some bits for him.\n\nTheres a football stall in our local shopping centre. They had squeezy balls for each team. My daughter knows that her dad loves football and also the colour blue, so she picked out a blue one for him. I knew it wasn't his team but theres nothing on the actual ball, it just said the team on the wrapper.\n\nShe bought it, we left, everything got wrapped up. \n\nWe were with him when he opened them. His face fell and he dropped the ball like it burned him when he opened it. His mum gave him the evil eyes so he did the clearly fake \"thank you\" and then our daughter was disinterested. \n\nHe was off with me the whole day and last night called me a bitch for \"doing that\" to him. I asked what he meant, he said I knew he hates that team (I didn't - I used to ignore his football rants) and that he thinks its shitty that I used our daughter as an excuse to upset him.\n\nI explained that she picked it out and he claimed I should have corrected her because he hates the gift.\n\nI called him a child. His mum has since text me apologising but in a \"even though its your fault\" way. She's usually on my side so now I'm half thinking its my fault in some sorta way.\n\nI did know he doesn't support that team and my daughter would have been corrected easily, so I probably should have done it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698758038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kkris/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_buy_her_dad_a_gift/", "score": 1872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see why he's your ex. What kind of psycho gets so angry about a squishy football picked out by their 3 YEAR OLD. Does he not understand that she's a toddler? The fact of the matter is SHE wanted to pick it you, SHE got it for him because he likes football and the color blue. Who gives a flying fart in space the team? She obviously doesn't. \n\nYour ex needs to do some work on himself if he can't see the gesture from his own daughter. I'd hate to see what happens when she's older and get something he doesn't \"approve\" of. Utterly ridiculous for a grown adult to act that way towards their child.", "NTA\n\n3 year old just wanted a football and a color that she knew daddy liked.  \n\nDaddy has anger management problems if he can't grin and bear  it for a 3 year old.", "NTA. Who says they 'hate' a gift, let alone one picked out by a three year old?\n\nSure, some football fans can be pretty intense in their hatred for rival football teams, so it doesn't hugely surprise me that he saw this as an attempt to upset him.\n\nBut he's not your partner \u2013 he's *her* dad, so letting your daughter choose the gifts was reasonably a higher priority to you than anticipating a grown man would be upset by the *wrapper* on a toy.", "I think there must be something I'm not getting here.  Why would he automatically assume that you're using your daughter as \"an excuse to upset him\"?", "NTA. I'm a true blue Leafs fan. If my little one bought me a little hockey item because it's my favourite colour I'd happily display it on my memorabilia shelf. Even if it was Habs, Bruins or God forbid, Canucks. Unless the choice of gift is inappropriate, don't interfere when a child is picking a gift. Jesus, your ex needs to grow up and your kid was just being thoughtful.", "ESH - he's immature for the way he reacted, but...  how hard would it have been to say \"honey thats a great idea for daddy, but let's pick the ball that is for his favorite team!\".", "NTA. Your daughter put a lot of thought into the gift that she chose and telling her different would have been detrimental. People who are expecting gifts they actually like from a flipping toddler are clearly not ready to parent. Hate that for the both of you.", "(I'm assuming by the language that you are potentially from the UK.)\n\nBeing a football fan raised by a football fan, ESH. These colours might seem entirely meaningless but to die hard fans they mean something. These are old long standing rivalries, issues with religion and traumatic events. For example, you don't buy a Celtic fan a Rangers ball because there is a lot of actual hate there not just rivalry. I know it is stupid but it has become part of the sport now.\n\nYou could have easily pointed your daughter to a different ball and he could have acted like an adult about it.", "Just don\u2019t buy him anything for his birthday. Problem solved.", "Sorry, against others opinions, YTA, but not for allowing your daughter to pick that out for him but because you knew better and seemingly did nothing to change your daughter\u2019s mind, and you did it out of spite and evil intent, and you know it. \n\nBasically, you used her to dig at your ex. \n\nHe was a jerk for his reaction, but you chose to not be the better person. \n\nThe others\u2019 comments probably don\u2019t have a team that they are ardent fans of so they don\u2019t have perspective. \n\nYes, a child\u2019s love is way more important, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that you chose to use this opportunity, and your daughter, to get a reaction out of her father.  \n\nI hope you grow from this.  It was immature, and you will probably realize it when you get older.  \n\nTo add, it was also totally disrespectful to your ex.   I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done things to you as well, but in this case you used your (plural) daughter, and that is the shameful part.", "\\>she picked out a blue one for him. I knew it wasn't his team\n\n\\>I let my daughter get her dad a gift I knew he'd dislike. \n\nYTA I almost said E S H but as much as I think it's pathetic to care about whether a ball that is a present from your daughter represents the team you like or not, I think this is really about you knowingly letting your daughter choose that ball. I don't believe for a second that you didn't realize how this would play out -- with him realizing this was your dig at him as you knew his team and how rabid a supporter he is. You knew it would get under his skin.\n\nYou had an opportunity to direct her to his team's ball, but chose to allow your daughter to get a poisoned gift for him, knowing that he had to accept it with a shit-eating grin for his daughter's sake even knowing you'd messed with him, or let your daughter down and look like a jerk. \n\nYou risked ruining the moment that was your innocent daughter wanting to make her father happy and that was wrong even just for the fact that it could have gone far worse and ended up with your daughter being really upset thinking that her father was rejecting \\*her.\\*", "My 3 year old wrapped up a half eaten apple squished together with a Spiderman lego, in toilet paper and then gifted it to me yesterday.  lol\n\nI took the gift with the love it was meant.", "ESH. He absolutely shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way, but if you *knew* it wasn\u2019t his team why not just redirect your daughter and tell her \u201ceven though daddy love blue, his favorite team wears (colors) and I bet he\u2019d love *this one* even more.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the bigger AH for sure, but it feels like common sense to not let your kid pick out a sports themed item if you know what team he actually likes.", "Info: Did you even try and redirect your daughter to a football from the team he likes? I feel like most 3 year olds would have no problem with being told \"not this one, the other one is even better for daddy\", and then the kid can still have the same amount of fun giving the gift to her dad. But at the same time if the kid was really focused on this one football, and for some reason was really determined to get THAT one for her dad, I could understand just letting it go as well. Ultimately this is really low stakes stuff, and it does sound like he pretended to like it for his daughter when she gave it to him, at least to the point where it seems from your story that your daughter didn't notice any negative reaction from him.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t really get all the NTAs here. Except most of them think it\u2019s ridiculous to be so passionate about sports. I \ud83d\udcaf% agree with that sentiment. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nBut OP already knew how passionate her ex was about football and, most definitely, knew he\u2019d be pissed with a gift from his rival\u2019s football team. You can argue OP\u2019s reaction was over the top (because it was), but **OP knew exactly how her ex would react**. That\u2019s why she bought the gift in the first place - to poke the bear.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201creally\u201d a precious gift from a 3 year old - it\u2019s a gift OP bought, knowing it was for a completely different team. OP could\u2019ve easily told her daughter that\u2019s a different team and showed the 3 year old merch for her ex\u2019s team. But she deliberately did not. \n\nAnd now OP comes here whining about how her ex got upset and rejected a precious gift from his daughter. Bullshit - he rejected a deliberately malice gift from his ex that could\u2019ve been trivially avoided.\n\nI would\u2019ve gone with E S H as the ex\u2019s reaction is absurd, but OP knew he would lose his shit and deliberately chose to use her daughter to piss off her ex. Shame on OP.", "I really want to go N T A because he should be able to gratefully accept a gift, especially from a three year old and especially from his daughter.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping me is the tone and message of this post. You didn\u2019t take the extra second to direct your daughter to a more thoughtful gift and using it as a general teaching moment. You belittle and dismiss his interests as unimportant and silly, and while I have no doubt that is because of his irrational attachment to his team it comes across as dismissing all people who enjoy such things as being ridiculous.\n\nYou know your ex enjoys supporting a certain team. You also likely know he\u2019s not the best at being grateful or managing his emotions. Why put your daughter in the line of fire when she doesn\u2019t have to be? Why not protect her?\n\nThis all comes across as you wanting to poke at your ex a little and being surprised at him reacting like you were poking a lot. \n\nRegardless of how big or small you the message you want to send, please don\u2019t use your daughter or send it in the future.\n\nESH.", "This reminds me of when I was a kid and got my dad a birthday gift with my own money. I was so happy and proud of myself. He was a Ford fan, die hard and I bought him a shirt with a Chevy logo on it. I thought it was the one he liked. I clearly remember that he was not happy about it and told me so. I must have been about five or six. I'm 43 now. It's funny the things that stick with you.", "ESH\nI would hate a present if I got merchandise that was the my teams rival.

Its a gift from his daughter, obviously she doesn't know, she's just happy to get something for her dad. It wont physically hurt him to hold memorabilia from the rival team. \n\nYou're the AH for giving zero fucks about a present. I feel like you should know enough about sports fandom that if you're going to get someone a sports related gift, you get the team they root for. Your daughter isn't going to know, so I feel like a gentle correction is appropriate. Like why wouldn't you want your daughter to give a gift that the recipient would enjoy? Its like all you care about is that your daughter is happy to get a gift for her dad, but you don't care about her connecting with her dad. Maybe there's some bitterness, maybe thats fair, but if you don't respect the relationship she has with her dad, its going to drive a wedge between you and her when she gets older.", "YTA, like other comments have said, you set your daughter up to fail knowing exactly what her father's reaction would be and now you're attempting to using it as ammunition. I can see why _you're his_ ex", "YTA\n\nI say this because you set your daughter up for disappointment and put your hubby in an awkward position.  And you wasted money on something no one wants.  And you did all this on purpose.  \n\nHow hard would it have been to explain to her about \"Daddy's favorite team\"?

She picked out a pair of fake diamond dangly earrings - the furthest thing from what I\u2019d ever wear. I wore them on Christmas Day feeling like a fool because she had picked them out. I still have them and treasure them! It would never have occurred to me to be angry at my husband for letting her pick out something he knew I wouldn\u2019t like. Your ex is TA. He expects to be coddled like a child. Consider yourself lucky he\u2019s your ex.", "Wtf? If my little girl gave me any kind of present that she picked out for me, I would melt. And it sounds like you paid for it too. It doesn't matter what the present is, its a 3 year old girl. Also what kind of person hates a football team so much?

There's no excuse to not accepting and loving your child's gifts with so much effort put in because THEY THOUGHT OF YOU, THEY LOVE YOU ENOUGH TO THINK OF YOU. When i was younger I bought my nan a candle stick holder as an ash tray but she still loved it and used it because its the thought that counts.

Bloke could throw the packaging away and be left with a football in one of his favourite colours chosen by his child. \nI don't understand the reaction..", "Again i agreed that he was a bit of a dick to the kid.  \n\n\nHowever what we are discussing is if OP was in the wrong.  \n\n\nAnd from her comments and the story overall, i get the vibe that she could've stopped this, yet let it go on purpose. Hence why i said slight YTA (because i dont actually know for sure.)", "Because it isn't about the colour? These were specifically football team balls and she knew her kid got one from a team her ex hates. She had MULTIPLE points to prevent this situation she damn well knew would occur. She's a petty person who is intentionally using her kid to hurt her ex.\n\nAnd your blatant disregard for that and inability to understand why people are passionate about their hobbies weird as they may seem to you is not painting a pretty picture of you.", "That's stupid.

A decent parent naturally appreciates a gift from their child because of the thought and love that was put into it, without pretending.

The kid didn\u2019t \u201cpick out\u201d the specific ball because they thought their dad liked the team that the ball was manufactured to represent, they picked it because it was blue. OP was more than capable of telling the kid \u201cdaddy would like this blue ball better\u201d because she understands more than a toddler does. She didn\u2019t even suggest it.", "But if you have the chance and the knowledge to make that gift even better, why wouldn't you? OP's ex is 100% an asshole, but she really should have done better.", "Because kids often see taking the wrapper off something as \"opening\" the present, and if it's not for mom, then kid throws fit. I've tried to do this with my kids, where they get presents for my hubs, my oldest focuses on logos (maybe a little too much), middle focuses on color, doesn't care what it is, just that it's the right color, and youngest is food specific. Middle kiddo will buy something she knows is her daddy's favorite color, she gives absolutely zero fucks if it's a logo of something else, and the one time I tried to take the wrapper off it (we don't leave wrappers with prices on them), she lost her mind. And I do mean lost it. She hit me and screamed multiple times \"that's daddy's not yours\". My middle kid is 3.5 years old. She knows when she buys something and it's meant for one person and one person only she thinks you're trying to steal it if you take the wrapper off.", "Or she thought he would appreciate a gift his toddler picked for him. The ball didn\u2019t even have the team name on it, it was just blue.", "If daughter wants to support a different team because she likes the colours then that\u2019s fine. But the more I keep reading this the more I convince myself it was intentional by OP, and actually if Ex had completely lost it, that would have been the response they wanted, so they could say \u2018see this is what your dad is like\u2019 as OP says daughter loves her daddy.

Even if it did have the team logo on it if that was my kid picking out something they think I\u2019d love I\u2019d still keep it, could be a funny thing to look back on when they\u2019re older.

Did op guide the child and say \u201cget this one it\u2019ll annoy your daddy sooooo much let\u2019s make him angry\u201d no, the child seen a colour her dad liked on a ball. Honestly op shouldn\u2019t bother in the future, let him get no presents from the kid till she\u2019s old enough to get them herself or have his mommy get them.

Bc he was upset he didn\u2019t like his gift god forbid he has feelings, and let\u2019s not forget this evil pig of a man still thanked his daughter for the gift *spits* disgusting and just when u thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse this absolute cretin had the gall to call out his ex as if he has had some intimate relationship with her and probably knows this is some shit that she\u2019d do, and let\u2019s not forget the ex\u2019s mother who OP said usually takes her side except for this time, maybe bc she knew OP did tht shit on purpose too\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "We're not 3 and neither is OP, her motives are very clearly not as pure as their daughters were.

You do realise there are quite a lot of women who love football with a passion? And this isn't about shitty male behaviour, this is about a parent weaponizing her kid to get a reaction. He didn't do anything to the kid, he had a momentary realization when he opened the gift and likely knew what his ex had done because a toddler isn't capable of BUYING AND WRAPPING GIFTS. \n\nPeople can hate rival teams all they wants, but the anger here isn't due to that it's due to a parent being so callously assholey that she used her kid to jab at her ex.
