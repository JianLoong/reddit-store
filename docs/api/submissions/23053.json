But I\u2019m keeping my distance because of his wife\u2019s comments. I\u2019ve read through the comments on my last post and I can agree I think my SIL is a bit racist from some passive aggressive comments she made about my wife but she apologized for them in the past. \n\nAnother issue why I\u2019m keeping such a distance from my SIL is because me and my wife are pregnant(she told me this week). I\u2019m really concerned situations like this will happen around my child and I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want my child to think I would allow micro aggressions thrown at them in their own home. I told my brother this and he understands, but he\u2019s hurt that I think about his wife in such way. But I simply don\u2019t care I can\u2019t sympathize with them on this. My SIL is a grown woman and knows exactly what she says and how they can affect people. \n\n\nAnother thing I wanna address is my brother has bought my SIL a whole lot and have taken her on multiple vacations. And my brother makes enough money to provide what I do and I\u2019ll be honest he has a trust fund I\u2019m sure is more than enough. Yes I do make a bit more money and that\u2019s only because of outside income and my wife has a good job as well she makes good money she works in marketing. So I don\u2019t think my SIL is jealous of what I provide but maybe what I give to my wife emotionally. \n\nAnd well my Mother and Sister aren\u2019t speaking to my SIL at the moment and she\u2019s blaming my wife instead of me. This just makes me want to distance myself from her more. \n\nOne more thing is yes my wife spoils me just as much lol. She always doing things for me for example she\u2019s been really into making bento boxes and she\u2019s been making me them everyday to take for lunch. She also buys me a lot for film me and my friends have made short films since college. And she recently bought me a new electric guitar for my birthday in may that I\u2019ve been wanting for a long time. And of course she buys me things sporadically at target when she goes just to go. \n\nAnyway there\u2019s an update I\u2019m just keeping my distance from them hopefully nothing blows up.\n\nOriginal post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153gz83/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_f_off_because_he/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "created_utc": 1690231422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158mh5c/update_aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_f_off/", "score": 205, "replies": []}
