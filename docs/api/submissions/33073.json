Swearing and generally being a bit out of control is NORMAL and to be expected.\n\nNot to mention - \"taking the lord's name in vain\" actually has very little to do with saying \"Jesus!\" when you're in pain.

When my best friend was in labor, her male doctor came in to speak to her and said \"I'm going to lunch, this isn't happening soon\" but she knew it was, so she grabbed him by the tie, yanked his head down and growled \"The baby is coming NOW.\" And she was right, the baby was born very soon after.

You were in labor, and the cardinal rule of labor is that anything that happens in labor gets forgotten as soon as the baby is safe and born. The doctor, however, is a big asshole for trying to force his religion on you *while you were in labor*. I'd actually go so far as to say I'd consider that a violation of his medical duties to you. And your husband is kind of an asshole for not being on your side.", "NTA.  When I eas prepping for surgery years ago, a person asked me if I wanted something for the pain.  Given that my appendix was about to burst, I said I wanted pain killers.  the nurse got very prim and said \"We don't like that word here.\" I swear I wanted to wring her neck.  \n\ncertain times are not good for correcting language.", "If the doctor cant stand ditching couth for a while and take some stuff said under extreme circumstances in stride, from a woman in labor, he needs to reevaluate how he acts at work.

Sigh....", "And \u201cYeshua\u201d is an Aramaic contraction of the Hebrew \u201cyehoshua\u201d which means \u201cYHWH is salvation\u201c, apparently. So \u201dJesus Christ\u201d could be expanded to \u201cThe anointed I AM who saves\u201d.    \nwhich is pretty cool if you happen to follow the guy.", "Yeah it does cause cramping for a lot of people! It\u2019s usually mild though, I\u2019m sorry it was so bad for you. Maybe they used more since it was for surgery?
