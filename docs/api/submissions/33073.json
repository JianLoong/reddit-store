Get the hell over it but an adult can also apologize for mistreating someone while in pain. Do you get abused at your work and think it\u2019s ok? No it\u2019s not. No one should go to work and be abused! No one. No one gets paid enough for it. It\u2019s a simple apology not giving away their first born. No one gives a shit that you hate religion and no matter your beliefs or anyone else\u2019s you still doesn\u2018t give you the right to abuse someone ever!", "Oh yes it is. Highly inappropriate to lecture or chastise her in any form", "jesus christ, not everyone cares about made up gods.  also, lecturing someone on language during childbirth is incredibly dumb.", "Oh jesus fucking christ, it absolutely is.", "Oh, please.  His only job was to say, \"Breathe\" and \"Push\" and \"Nurse, pass me the gauze.\"  Everything else is white noise.", "He is entitled to have his beliefs, not to force them on others while their lives are in his hands. Perhaps you should find a new line of work if you think this is an appropriate way to treat patients.", "There's a time and place. Giving birth is not the time nor place. Fuck that doctor.", "And where is the apology from the doctor for bringing their own bullshit into the delivery room? Medical staff don't get some shield of protection from being called out on their shit. The doctor was an asshole and was treated as such", "And no doubt can\u2019t be the worst thing an OBGYN has heard in a delivery room", "Asking someone not to take the lords name in vain is not forcing someone to do anything. It a request. He is helping deliver her baby. He could have just walked out after she told him to go fuck himself but he didn\u2019t he stayed. Just address the issue with the doctor. After six weeks she will have to see them again for a check up in the same position.  adults talk about disagreements. Then they can both hash it out. Its called adulting", "I should find a new line of work? Do you get abused at your job? No and neither should anyone else. It\u2019s behaviour like these entitled attitudes that are forcing medical clinics and hospitals to have policies in place to protect their staff from this kind of abuse or worse. Adults don\u2019t make excuses for bad behaviour she could have a simple conversation with the doctor and clear this up.", "Her pain is over. She has her baby and is more level headed now. Nothing wrong with apologizing after the fact for telling your doctor who assisted you to bring your child in this world im sorry for telling you to go fuck yourself. This is the exact reason in every medical facility they have policies regarding abuse, swearing and treatment of medical staff. Because people feel their pain makes them entitled to treat medical staff like shit. Nothing wrong with being an adult and apologizing for being rude to someone", "Pro tip: don't request things from people while they're in immense amounts of pain and you're supposed to focus on taking care of them.", "Yes, you should find a new line of work. This was an absolutely unprofessional and entitled request he made of her while she was having a medical procedure done.", "If they talked about it after maybe patient and doctor can both learn from it instead of focusing on someone asking you not to do something she is here focusing on don\u2019t take the lords name in vain. Good lord. How about they both apologize and move on instead of a bunch of people defending abuse of medical staff over someone making a request in regards to their religious beliefs. Good lord first world problems"]}
