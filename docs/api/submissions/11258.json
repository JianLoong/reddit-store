I get it. It\u2019s like if you don\u2019t tell anyone then it\u2019s not real. But you can\u2019t avoid it. I think you should tell your family, but this is a situation that\u2019s not for Reddit. Take time to take all of it in and decide what YOU think is the best course of action.

I'm not sure. I think there may be better subreddits geared towards advice for cancer patients that would give better answers than this sub. \n\nI'm wishing you the best no matter what you decide to do. <3", "NTA\n\nThis is your life. You get to write the ending. Good Journey.", "It's probably not the right sub for this post but that's okay.  It's understandable that you don't won't to be surrounded by sadness in your final year but I feel like you have to tell them.  If you just ghost them and then die they will be wondering what they did wrong for the rest of their lives.  They need the opportunity to have some closure as well.  I think that you tell them but be very clear that you want no sadness or negativity in your remaining and if anyone cannot comply with that you request that they keep a distance from you.", "The knowledge that you have a few months to live is hard to digest. It\u2019s not wrong for you to want peace and space.\n\nYou might want to meet a lawyer and write a will though.

But you might be underestimating your family and friends and their reaction to your illness. I\u2019m inclined to give them a chance to show you how great and supportive they are.

Zero pity, just love and support.", "NTA.\n\nMy mother was dying of cancer, she wanted to fly out to Oregon as they are a state that allows you to die on your terms if you are terminally ill, but by the time she wanted to do this, the doctors would not allow her to fly.", "I'd strongly advise you to have a chat (or an extended discussion) with a therapist or death doula.  Contact your local hospice association for recommendations.\n\nI think if you talk this over with someone outside of your family who has expertise in matters of planning death and counseling folks who are grieving, you might get a much better idea of how to handle your own family in a way that respects your own needs, but also enables them to be there for you in ways you can approve.", "You might be t a for just noping out without a word.  \n\nWrite letters, not a note, to each person/family.

Everything you say sounds rational and reasonable.\n\nI am wondering why you are saying that chemo is just prolonging the inevitable? What type of cancer is this that you are thinking is 100% fatal in 12 months?", "While I think you should have the type of death that you want, I've been around people that have been left like that and they were devastated.  There are so many unanswered questions, their pain was real.  \n\nYou don't write that you have a family of narcissists, from what you wrote, you don't want to deal with their reactions.   That's fair, I would not want to deal with that either.  \n\nHere's a thought, could you send them a letter explaining your situation and  how you have contemplated just not telling them because of being unable to deal with their sadness.  That you would welcome them into your life if they are able to not dump their sadness onto you.  The moment their pain because too much for you, you will have to step away from them, your peace of mind here is what matters.  If you have someone that you could trust to be an advocate for you to remind them of your wishes, all the better.  \n\nI just remember the story of the woman that died, that knew she was dying, while she encouraged her family to do a remodel for her mobility.  She just went to the hospital for what was a routine check and never came out.  \n\nThere's no way I would ever judge you TA for whatever decision you choose, your life, your choice.

Do what you want and when you want.  It's okay to stop chemo. Sometimes, the cure is worse than the disease. I would recommend instead of a letter.  Make a video.  Letter's can be impersonal for something like this. Explain exactly what you feel and why you feel this way. Some people will be hurt. Some pissed off. Some might not GAShat. It's your life that began at birth. Your life at the end. Just do things on your terms. Reach out when you're ready. Or never.  With your video. Speak to each person individually.  Have a will.", "Sooo nta\n\nMy aunt never had chemo because It scared her, why? Nobody knows, she went along with grandpa to the first session but in the waiting room she got anxious and basically ran off. Honestly i do not understand this but the truth Is that I don't need to, It was her life and she had the right to do whatever she wanted with it. In your case if somebody ever calls you selfish its because that person Is only thinking of themselves. Don't Let others dictate what to do with the rest of your life. Just try to spend as much time as you can with the people you love. \nHave a good time", "NTA. This is your life and your ending. You should face it as you choose. Nobody would blame you if your feelings about this are all over the place. And frankly, this is going to be hard on your loved ones either way.\n\nThat said\u2026 this guilt might be telling you something useful. Assuming the relationship is decent, your family may be a comfort to you, if you do decide to include them, and the chance to gather and say goodbye may be a comfort to them.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for what you\u2019re going through.", "Going above Reddit's pay grade again. I swear you all make it harder every time.   \nSo... You will never be TA for wanting things on your terms, especially when you are told your life is out of your control and your body is betraying you in the most unkind way possible. I would urge you though to tell your family. Funerals are for the living after all, plus it is a chance for you to pick who will follow your last wishes- like making sure no one plays One Sweet Day at your funeral or that your great aunt Maggie isn't allow to fling her body on your coffin and say 'no no they were so young, take me instead!'  \nThese are you last wishes, these are your last days, live them as best you can and savor what you want, or sulk. It is-as you know best of all- YOUR life.   \n\n\nTake care of yourself OP and I hope you are at least not in pain.", "NTA for wanting what you want in a trying time, but, and this is a big but, you will more than likely be giving them lifelong insecurity issues and/or problems dealing with how you left them behind to die and didn't say anything, didn't trust them. I'm not sure I see the average person realizing that you did that just going \"Okay, Andy wanted to die his way\" and not \"WTF I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR THEM\" or something of that nature.\n\nI'm NOT saying that to guilt you. You're in a horrid situation that most people never have to deal with.", "NAH.\n\nI'm so sorry for the position you're in. It's terrible, and there are no two ways about it. You're entitled to choose your way of leaving.\n\nI just want to suggest two things, or maybe just one. The first one is that it's probably going to get worse before the end, and you might appreciate the support that your family can provide. That is really the first thing--what will make the next year the best, or most tolerable, for you. When my father was dying it was a relief to him to see his family and friends while he was still well enough to interact and enjoy the time. That could be you.\n\nSecond, your family and friends will feel a terrible loss when you die, and you can't prevent that. Keeping quiet isn't going to change that, or reduce the pain when you die. Sharing it with them before you die may make it better for you and for them.\n\nWhen my father died of cancer, and it was just two months from diagnosis to his death, maybe three, he agreed to go along with chemo and radiation, and he grew to resent it bitterly because it was a miserable experience and it did no more than buy him a few more weeks of a pretty miserable existence.
