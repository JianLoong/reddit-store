Shortly after we got to the bar, my boyfriend\u2019s cousin said their family friend was here and pointed her out to my boyfriend who hadn\u2019t met her before and didn\u2019t recognize her. She was sitting at a table with her female friends and my boyfriend went over (by himself) to introduce himself and say hello. He then proceeded to grab the deck of cards from the deck of cards from our table and bring it over there to play drinking games with them and left me to sit with our friends. \n\nAfter a while I went over there and sat at their table. I introduced myself and mentioned he was my boyfriend. Here\u2019s what really upset me, after I said he was my boyfriend the girl I was talking to was shocked. She thought he was over there flirting with them. I was really uncomfortable and hurt and after they finished their card game, I got up to go back to our table expecting my boyfriend to follow me and he didn\u2019t. When he finally came back I told him I was upset with him and he basically turned it back around on me and started acting like I was unreasonable for being upset. \n\nHe made us leave the bar even though my friends were having fun and I didn\u2019t want to be a party pooper and he started yelling at me on our walk home. I broke down crying and he just walked off without me and left me to wait for my friends to walk me home. \n\nWhen I made it back home we had a huge fight about it and he just kept saying that he wasn\u2019t trying to cheat on me and it\u2019s not his fault if the girls thought he was flirting with them. He claims that he mentioned he had a girlfriend and kept saying that they\u2019re just dumb girls. I tried explaining to him that regardless of what the girls said or thought, it\u2019s inappropriate for him to leave me at the bar to go sit at a table with a bunch of cute, single, young women for an hour. I pointed out that none of our friends who were with us had left their girlfriends in the way he left me and that I was the only one sitting at our table without my S/O.

I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it's neglectful and bordering on abusive, if this is how he's treating you in front of your friends after just a year dating, I'm not hopeful for the future of this relationship.\nI would advise getting out earlier and finding someone who truly deserves you.\n\nJust a question for a little more context:\n\n1.

These are huge red flags of a ticking time bomb. He has plenty of signs of being manipulative and inconsiderate. The only time I would leave my girlfriend to sit at another table with other women would be at a family get together and it would be with my aunts and grandmother. I don\u2019t like sweeping generalizations or suggesting a man can\u2019t talk to other women, but the moment I saw a deck of cards come out all I could think was \u201cChrist\u2026 for real, dude?\u201d Let alone everything that followed that. I\u2019ll say this much, there are only two types of people that bust out cards at a party. Dads entertaining the kids with cheap tricks and players trying to play. \n\nSeriously. Dump him.

Your instincts are onto something. Trust them.\n\nEdit 2: if you do decide to take the dump him route, prepare yourself mentally for every trick in the book. I\u2019ll change. You\u2019re being unreasonable. After all I\u2019ve done. The gaslighting. Maybe even worse. I\u2019ve seen people like this reveal some ugly sides to themselves.

I don\u2019t know anything about this guy beyond what you\u2019ve said, but from what I\u2019ve experienced, guys like that don\u2019t take kindly to losing control over others.

You started it off correctly, that she isn\u2019t allowed to control who he talks to.  \n\nThe OP said they got into a huge fight, it doesn\u2019t say she sat on the couch and he screamed in her face. You ever fight with your SO? It\u2019s a two way street. Arguing in a relationship isn\u2019t disrespectful by itself and the fact you were able to glean that from her vague use of \u201cfight\u201d tells me you\u2019re projecting or you\u2019re a GD mind reader. \n\nFor the OP: it happened. Talk to him and tell him you felt uncomfortable being left alone or you would have liked to be included. Once things settle down, if he can\u2019t understand that then maybe you aren\u2019t compatible.", "Also, you told her to read up on subtle signs? Wtf man. I bet she\u2019ll read that her behaviors should also set off alarm bells.", "Please spare us your advice. It\u2019s trash b", "I disagree. Yes, I stick to the rule of hanging out with the group I came with, but if my boyfriend moves to another table where his family's friends are sitting, that doesn't automatically make him an AH.\r  \nBut if I ask him to come back or ask him if he's flirting with these people and he throws a tantrum, then yes, he will become an AH.", ">and he started yelling at me on our walk home  \n>  \n> he just walked off without me and left me\n\n\u0410re you serious?\r  \nI used a comma lol. I didn't write that he did it at the same time", " \"he started yelling at me on our walk home.\" \n\nIt's in the literal story if you use context clues you would be able to follow along. Read slower than I advised before.", "How is expressing her feelings to her boyfriend controlling? She is COMPLETELY within her rights to decide whether or not this damages her relationship to the point of no return. Sounds like you think men are somehow entitled to a girlfriend, even if said girlfriend feels disrespected and unloved.", "Jesus christ gtfo, clearly you're the person who leaves their partner to flirt with other people, and it shows.", "Your user flair is amazing hahahaha, I gotta figure out how to set one up for this sub. Definitely classic gaslighting tho", "If she was a male and he was a female, you\u2019d be saying the opposite. Youre the AH.", "OMG I was gonna ask the same thing \ud83d\ude02", "Ya you need to learn to read. He yelled at hwr in the street. He forced her to go home.  He told her it was her fault for being upset that he left her and their friends to spend time with  strangers. Strangers who didn't know he bad a girlfriend sitting in the same room as them. OP already did explain she was uncomfortable and he walked away and left her alone. HE is the problem and you can't see that hia behavior ia wrong ans abusive then it's probably because it's the way you behave yourself or that you have bewn abused ao long you can't recognise it when you see it.  So maybe it's time for you to so some research and learn what an abusive looks like because what OP wrote is textbook. And FYI,  I don't yell at my partner when we have disagreements, I don't abandon them on walks home at night, I don't try to blame them for my behavior amd the samw goea for him. We speak like respectful adults when we have a disagreement. You know why?  Because neither of us are abusers.", "For real, Reddit thinks every disagreement is a sign of abuse.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, abusive people (espeically men) can hide it for years, and it only comes out once the other person is tied down, but this seems like a minor issue at best. Your advice is definitely the most sensible.", "Her \"behaviors\" were perfectly normal.  You have a very  skewed view of what's healthy and what isn't.", "This is a trash comment", "Did you miss the part where he didn\u2019t actually know the family friend? His cousin had to point her out.", "You sound controlling.", "Yeah, it was an argument. You guys are making it as though he got in her face and spat at her.", "They were arguing. Men tend to raise their voice in an argument and women tend to cry. It\u2019s a tactic. Get over it.", "It\u2019s dependent on how many posts you end up having the top comment on. For example, the person you replied to has had 20 top comments where a judgment was issued based on what they decided.", "and what does this change?\r  \nI'm not denying that he's an ah, but I don't understand why everyone here thinks that leaving the company where your girlfriend is in order to meet someone who is connected to your family immediately makes you an ah. Once again: leave to get acquainted, don\u2019t flirt, don\u2019t be rude to the girlfriend - that\u2019s the part where he screwed up.", "So a family friend, someone the family knows. Yeah, \u201cwow, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you! My mom has talked about you her whole life, my dad told me war stories about your dad and him. I can\u2019t believe we are just now meeting! How is my other cousin doing? I haven\u2019t seen him in years!\u201d\n\nYeah it would be so weird to talk to someone that knows your family.", "Haha, funny. Where exactly?", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with going over and introducing yourself, maybe a 5 minute chat to get to know them a bit, but to literally grab cards from your girlfriends group to ditch her and play with people you\u2019ve just met, it\u2019s really rude. Even if they had just been friends, ditching people you came to hang out with for another group is really impolite. Doing it to a partner makes him an AH."]}
