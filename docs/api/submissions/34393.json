When I was in my late teens, I had this issue (not gonna get into details), and had to get both my testicles removed. Now, I've got these prosthetics and am on hormonal replacement therapy.\n\nI generally don't openly share this as I feel it's a personal matter. The only ones who know the details are my parents and my wife. She learned about it when we started dating because I prefer to be upfront. Fortunately, she's always been very understanding. Having children was never a priority for her, and since I can't, it's worked out well for both of us.\n\nHowever, since we got married, a few things have become a bit uncomfortable. The first two years were fine, but recently, it seems like a switch has flipped in the minds of people we know. Almost everyone now asks us, 'When are you gonna have kids?' We usually respond that it's not in our plans and try to steer the conversation elsewhere. However, some individuals are persistently annoying, saying things like 'Oh, but you guys need to' or 'You'll never be complete without kids.' It's starting to bother me quite a bit.\n\nSo, last week during a meeting with a couple of friends, someone brought up the topic. Admittedly, I was already having a rough day, and when they asked about us having kids, I, against my better judgment, just said, 'Well, never. I can't have kids. I'm sterile, don't even have testicles. So, if you could kindly stop bothering us about it, I'd really appreciate it.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, that comment really soured the mood for the entire evening. People got very upset and uncomfortable, to the point where both my wife and I decided to leave. I apologized to my wife, who seemed unbothered, claiming 'They had it coming,' but I'm aware that people in our friend group have been talking behind our backs. They say I was rude and acted like an asshole, insisting that they couldn't have known, and were just looking out for us. Now, I do feel like an asshole for the way I spoke; I could have communicated more civilly, especially for my wife's sake. She enjoys meeting our friends, and I doubt it will happen much in the near future until this blows over.\n\nAnyhow, Reddit, AITA? Also, forgive me if the text doesn't make much sense.

People thinking other's reproductive status and/or choices are ANY of their goddamn business. \n\nI am childless at 38yrs old for other (health related) reasons. And the pressure/expectation people have about other people having children is an ongoing frustration for me. It is literally NONE of anyone's business and people are SO naive as to reasons why someone may or may not have children. \n\nI think you did great to be upfront, even though they were in no way entitled to that information about yourself. People suck. \n\nI wish you and your wife lots of happiness and I'm glad you have each other!", "Jesus christ. Those aren't your friends.", "NTA, about 100 billion percent.\n\nI am very firmly of the opinion that asking couples when they are going to have kids is incredibly, INCREDIBLY rude. Not having kids is common for myriad reasons, and it is also an incredibly sensitive topic for many people. What if, for example, somebody who was sterilised by force was asked that question? Or a couple who miscarried? Or a couple who had a child who was lost in some way? That question alone is rude enough, but when it's followed up by all the 'your life will never be complete without them' nonsense, it's even worse. Some people want/wanted nothing more in their lives than to have children. Imagine not being able to have them, then somebody coming along and saying that they will never have complete lives without them? See what I mean? RUDE. RUDE RUDE RUDE.\n\nFrankly, after what you and your wife have been through, you saying you don't have testicles is on the politer end of acceptable. I'd have been more graphic: \"well it'll be hard to do that because, despite having hot, steamy sex about 83,000% more than people with crotch dumplings do, every time I come I'm shooting total blanks into her. It turns out silicone testicles can't do everything real bollocks can. So I guess we're just stuck being able to sleep in on weekends and travel the world together while you all get to have no money or free time for the next eighteen years. Oh wells.\"\n\nAnd you'd STILL be less rude than these AHs constantly badgering you about when you're going to have kids.\n\nEdit: changed 'married couples' to 'couples' for inclusion's sake.", "NTA\n\nYour friends weren't looking out for you, they were bothering you about something that isn't their business.

I've had people asking me from my early 20's to even now, late 40's, when I was going to have kids. I got to a point where I just started telling people I can't have them. This inevitably leads to the most invasive, rude, ignorant question ever: why can't you have them (insert sad face). Answer: because I don't fucking like them. Works every time.
