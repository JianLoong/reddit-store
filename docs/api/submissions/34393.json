When I was in my late teens, I had this issue (not gonna get into details), and had to get both my testicles removed. Now, I've got these prosthetics and am on hormonal replacement therapy.\n\nI generally don't openly share this as I feel it's a personal matter. The only ones who know the details are my parents and my wife. She learned about it when we started dating because I prefer to be upfront. Fortunately, she's always been very understanding. Having children was never a priority for her, and since I can't, it's worked out well for both of us.\n\nHowever, since we got married, a few things have become a bit uncomfortable. The first two years were fine, but recently, it seems like a switch has flipped in the minds of people we know. Almost everyone now asks us, 'When are you gonna have kids?' We usually respond that it's not in our plans and try to steer the conversation elsewhere. However, some individuals are persistently annoying, saying things like 'Oh, but you guys need to' or 'You'll never be complete without kids.' It's starting to bother me quite a bit.\n\nSo, last week during a meeting with a couple of friends, someone brought up the topic. Admittedly, I was already having a rough day, and when they asked about us having kids, I, against my better judgment, just said, 'Well, never. I can't have kids. I'm sterile, don't even have testicles. So, if you could kindly stop bothering us about it, I'd really appreciate it.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, that comment really soured the mood for the entire evening. People got very upset and uncomfortable, to the point where both my wife and I decided to leave. I apologized to my wife, who seemed unbothered, claiming 'They had it coming,' but I'm aware that people in our friend group have been talking behind our backs. They say I was rude and acted like an asshole, insisting that they couldn't have known, and were just looking out for us. Now, I do feel like an asshole for the way I spoke; I could have communicated more civilly, especially for my wife's sake. She enjoys meeting our friends, and I doubt it will happen much in the near future until this blows over.\n\nAnyhow, Reddit, AITA? Also, forgive me if the text doesn't make much sense. English isn't my native language, and I tried using one of those syntax tools, but I'm not sure if it really worked.", "created_utc": 1704473861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zbl5x/aita_for_telling_people_i_cant_have_kids/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fortunately you and your wife are fine with your circumstances, but some people feel a lot of pain over not being able to conceive. Whay if the two of had recently lost a pregnancy? People never consider that possibility. They need to mind their business.  Again, HUGE NTA.", "NTA. They asked for it.", "NTA some people need a swift reminder about why they shouldn't pester or press private matters.", "NTA. People who try to pester other people into having children they don't want are the assholes.", "NTA.\n\n\"We couldn't of known\" is exactly the point. They couldn't of known, so they shouldn't of asked. Full stop.  \nAsking about kids can be a very sensitive topic for alot of people, and it's hard to know who it'll effect and how.\n\nI don't understand the societal norm of asking other people about having children just because they reached a certain milestone in their relationship.\n\nThey really did have it coming, cos they shouldn't see it as a normal question to ask as it's none of their business.", "NTA - as someone who suffered silently with infertility for seven years, good for you! I bet that felt fantastic, and your wife is right, they had it coming. No one should ever ask people when they're having kids, that's so invasive and personal. You have no idea what people are dealing with privately.", "Nta. You had given your answer before. Not your fault they couldn't accept the pg answer. I would tell them exactly what happened, all the goring details and then see if they ask again.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s rude when people keep badgering you and your wife about having kids. I\u2019m with your wife on this: They had it coming for being so pushy. The way you spoke and what you said wasn\u2019t rude either. You tried to be nice but no one got the hint. Brutal honesty was what they needed to hear. Maybe next time they\u2019ll learn to respect your boundaries.", "NTA!!! It's such a personal topic that asking directly like that is way out of line outside of a medical setting when it's being asked on a need to know basis. People are nosy. I hear people asking married couples this as \"I'm bored with your narrative arc, what's next?\" They're the assholes. There's a reason polite, respectful people don't ask like that and you have the response they deserved and I hope they learned a lesson, but people like that have no self awareness. I wish you and your wife an awesome childfree life together!", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. You know something hate when people always ask adults marrie or not when they\u2019re gonna have kids. As if it\u2019s a requirement and it makes you worthy. Especially towards women. And you for example say no it\u2019s like you\u2019ve committed a crime. I experience this a lot. This is brought up along with marriage. \n\nYou\u2019d think it\u2019s 21st century and people wouldn\u2019t act so pretentious. I\u2019m unsure if you want kids or not. Regardless it\u2019s none of my business. If maybe one do either of you ever do though there are other options which might be hard and expensive but I\u2019m just saying that you have some sort of options if you ever change you\u2019re mind. Because that does happen sometimes.\n\nAnyways NTA. Neither is your wife. Everyone being annoying and rude are the assholes. Also they aren\u2019t your friends if they are like this. At least I don\u2019t consider that friendship of people who care about you.", ">As you can imagine, that comment really soured the mood for the entire evening.\n\nThis boggles the mind. Your friends were asking invasive questions, were politely but thoroughly shut down and then have the nerve to be peeved about your response? Where's the humility?! \n\nNTA at all. It really shouldn't be news to people that many young couples are staying child-free these days anyway.", "NTA they had it coming", "NTA. They were the ones being rude and asking invasive questions, after you\u2019d already politely asked them to drop it.", "NTA. They felt entitled to your personal business, so you gave them exactly what they felt entitled to.", "NTA I don't think they were ever your \"friends\" if they're so comfortable talking behind your backs. I'd say good riddance.", "NTA wasn't even rude. Sorry you had to share more information than you feel comfortable with, just so you would stop getting harassed.", "They shouldn't have kept forcing a topic you were clearly not interested in even if you were childfree by choice. If they didn't understand anything gentler, that's on them.", "You nailed it!  They shouldn't be asking in the first place.  And now it'll be settled and they'll stop harping on it.\n\nOne time I was in a committee meeting for a church thing.  There were probably 20-25 people there.  They asked us each to go around the circle and say our names and one interesting thing about us.  Every single person said something like, \"My name's Kathy, and I have 4 kids.\"  \"My name's David and I have 3 kids.\"  Every single one.\n\nI was 3rd-to-last, and when it got to me, I just sort of spur-of-the-moment said, \"My name's Jenn, and I'm barren.\"  Everyone was shocked.  The last two people were like, \"Uh... uh... my name's Ken and I.... like pickleball?\"  ;'D  I still think about it and laugh.\n\nAnyhoo, I think you said exactly what you should.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad your wife was there and also had your back. Those \u201cfriends\u201d had it coming and they call it \u201clooking out for you\u201d but really they need to mind their own business. As a wife and mother, if someone says they don\u2019t want kids, or I can hear them steering the convo away from the topic, I respect that. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA. I agree with your wife,  they asked for it.  It might have been done a bit less aggressively,  but really after the first time or two of asking and you telling them children weren't in your plan,  they should have gotten a clue and quit asking.", "NTA your friends are idiots, your wife is correct. People should mind their own business", "Yes, and how were the other people \"looking out for them\" by pestering them about having children?  Did they think the OP and his wife were just forgetting to have sex and needed a reminder so one day they wouldn't be like, \"Oops!  We should have tried to procreate!\"", "Its like putting someone on blast with the whole, ***\"When are you getting married? You guys have been together for like three years, right?\"***\n\nIf I don't bring up my business to you, you don't need to bring it up to me. Stay in your lane and mind your manners people - even with friends. \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m a mom and I HATE THIS SENTIMENT. Because children shouldn\u2019t complete you.\n\nMy other gear grinder are the people who say their children saved them\u2026..like I get it but you shouldn\u2019t need a child to save you.", "Yeah completely agree. I also think just the idea of trying to pressure someone into having kids is crazy. If someone doesn't want to have kids, that's a personal choice for them, but also why would you want to have a child with a parent who doesn't want them? Maybe they step up and do a great job as a parent and if so that's awesome. But I would much rather someone never have kids than have kids because, \"they'll never be complete without kids\" and discover they never actually wanted kids.", "I imagine they'll still find a way to pester him about it even with that knowledge", "Not complete without kids?  No mate, I am not complete due to a couple of missing testicles if it is any business of yours.  Then walk off whistling the 'Colonel Bogey March' with your head high! Sod those so called friends.", "Nah. He should never apologize. Explain, maybe. Ask questions about why they thought it was ok to CONTINUE asking about this topic after being politely shut down multiple times, definitely. \n\nThe most important thing OP needs to do is politely request an apology from THEM. Reproduction is a sensitive subject on a good day, and anyone with any sense at all knows not to press about it.", "No it isn't like asking about an old mustang. Surely this has taught you it's far from that. Having kids or not mines all sorts of emotions, unlike the Mustang. I can't believe I even have to say this. \n\nThe OP isn't the only one sick of the question. Having children or not is personal , and none of anyone's business.\n\nN T A.", "He didn't overshare at all. In my experience, saying something like \"Never\" or \"Can't happen\" won't work. The person will simply drill down harder; Never? Why not? Can't Happen? Please explain why. And then you'll be bombarded with questions about why you don't adopt etc. OP gave them the ultimate answer (though I guarantee there were some just itching to say \"Well, you can adopt!\").\n\nI think what OP said was perfect to get them to shut up. Perhaps a kinder variate would be to say \"We don't talk about our personal business.\" And then say nothing else, whatever they say to you.", "The kids question should not \"always come up.\" It's a rude question, even from a close friend. If someone wants to talk to you about their decisions about kids, they'll bring it up. The friends asked a personal question and they got a personal answer, why are they being crybabies about it?", "This reminds me of the friends who had trouble conceiving. When the questions got to be too much, the wife of the pair would say, \"Well, we keep kissing and kissing and NOTHING HAPPENS.\" And that cured a lot of people of their nosiness.", "Totally agree - I am a mom, and I hate this. Had a coworker who said her life started when she had her kid. I was like no.. it\u2019s just different now", "This. Also when people describe their 18 month old as their \"bestie\".", "Is this a hill to die on though?  That's the question only the OP can answer.\n\nYou apologize for what happened in part... or the way it happened... or whatever.  Sometimes preserving the relationship is more important than preserving the ego... friend circles are hard as hell to develop once you're married and older.  Dumb to bust it up over an outburst.\n\nAnd as I said... the goal is to put all perception of the ball into their court and give them no opportunity to further mischaracterize what happened.  It's entirely tactical and costs nothing.\n\nUp to the OP though... it's just reddit advice.  Nobody here is going to care in 24hrs.", "Yes! We recently had someone have a baby after years of being addicted and she\u2019s a great mom but everyone keeps saying how this baby is going to keep her clean and saved her and I am like THAT IS NOT THAT BABY\u2019S BURDEN.", "And here I am knowing my life would end if I had a child.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks but goshdarn people need to stop putting so much weird emotional pressure on their kids. It won't be fun for them when the kids grows up enough and desires space.", "Oh and please do not get me started on soulmate (I think that parental soul mates are a thing but that\u2019s for the child to determine). \n\nI\u2019m currently a girl mom but I had to distance myself from some boy moms because they are\u2026.something. Like my MIL has 3 sons and she has her moments but at least she\u2019s never ventured into emotional incest. She loves her kids and can be a bit overprotective but I find it healthy, because she\u2019s also like that about her kids partners and her grandkids. \n\nSome of these boy moms and their offspring. WHEW."]}
