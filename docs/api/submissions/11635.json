Saying it's unfair or she playing favorites. \n\nI'm upset because it's sentimental,  from my grandma and grandpa before he passed and because I've done so much art with it.

The kid wanted the iPad and took it, and the other members of the family are most likely thinking \"Hey if you were going to give that iPad away, why not give it to me?/I bought it for you/why does he deserve it\" which is petty, but for them to fight over an iPad must mean that they are not wealthy people and so to judge them for their perceived ignorance is wrong as well.", "I sympathize with you, and I don't think you're wrong.
