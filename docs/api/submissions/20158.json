Whenever I watch my niece or my friends' kids, their parents slip me some money for whatever we might do to cover both me AND the kids.  If I don't use it all, I offer it back at the end, but I don't think anyone has ever taken it.  \n\nIt's different when you also have kids and so you're trading playdates and presumably coming out roughly even on costs, but when you're watching their kids, they should be making sure you're at least breaking even.  Polite to cover your costs as well so you are getting free meals/treats/activities for your time with the kids (especially if they aren't paying you hourly for your time).  Your friend is using you for free childcare and freebies for her kids, and that really sucks considering she knows your situation.", "What favors do they do for you?", "Nta.  This woman is out to lunch, you\u2019re doing free babysitting for her, she knows money is tight and she\u2019s mad you don\u2019t want to spend your money to watch her kids.  You don\u2019t have kids so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s returning the favour she\u2019s just using you.\nI would decline next time she wants to send her kids over to you.", "NTA. Under no circumstances should anyone **ever** expect free child care from anyone else. If you have someone in your life you trust with your children\u2019s welfare who is willing and able to provide free childcare for you from time to time, then that\u2019s a fortuitous bonus. And for a time, you were both willing and able. Now that you\u2019ve lost your livelihood, you remain willing, just less able. You shouldn\u2019t have to come out of an increasingly limited pocket to do your friend a favor. The fact is she\u2019s a parent, and childcare is one of her parental responsibilities. If you weren\u2019t willing to do it for $20, her other options would be to pay a stranger way more than $20, or stay home. It isn\u2019t just that you\u2019re not an asshole, she\u2019s being a giant asshole.", "NTA - what is her end of the \"favor between friends\" and if it really is just to see her kids lmao nope you're not free service. My best friend is who my kid calls auntie, but I still pay her a going rate if she's gonna watch the kid.", "NTA- don\u2019t let her guilt you into thinking you\u2019re going the wrong thing. She\u2019s exploiting your good nature for free babysitting and she definitely knows what\u2019s she\u2019s doing. I feel like every comment on this is going to say what I am saying and if it does, I would suggest showing your friend this. She is lucky to have someone as accommodating as you are. Babysitters are not cheap and a 20 for resources given to her kids is not asking for much and in truth she should be giving you much more than that.", "NTA. You're doing a favor to her by giving you her time and babysitting for free; she should pay expenses incurred. Most people pay $20+/hr for babysitting these days.  As a friend, she should recognize your situation and offer to pay you for helping her out. I think she's fallen into the habit of taking advantage of your friendship and taking advantage of you.", "NTA. But your friend is. Its more than enough you take their children, but doing it on your dime is insane. Parents know to always bring food and everything their child will need, not just giving cash and making you take them to the store with you to feed them. Your friend is RUDE.", "NTA.  Asking for a bit of cash when babysitting is entirely reasonable, doubly so when you have to feed them.", "INFO: she says favour between friends but it seems completely one sided and has moved from possibly once being a favour to an obligation. What are you currently getting from this friendship? What's the quid pro quo?", "NTA - and my heart goes out to you. Before becoming chronically ill myself ( I have one son) I did a lot for others, other kids, ( far too long to describe here) and had the money to do all sorts \u2026. \n\nBut then I got badly ill. And it took me a long time to sort out ESA and PIP ( disability benefits I\u2019m UK) And believe me you find out who your friends are when you\u2019re no longer able to do as much. Or when you need help. Or when you can\u2019t finance the things you used to.\n\nYou are NTA OP - but your friends are TA\u2019s.

Sorry, but they are.", "NTA - Your friend should be grateful that she's not having to pay for a babysitter, you're being a good friend, and if she's as good of a friend as she should be, she shouldn't complain when you ask for some extra money, it's not like you're asking for hundreds of dollars.", "NTA", "Nta. If she asks again for child care say that you can come to their house, or it will be $xyz for snacks and activities and you know your friend understands that because you are not working you have time to help, but not the extra cash to put out for snacks and fun things.", "NTA", "NTA. Child care is so expensive nowadays. They should be *Thankful* that you are doing this for them, even for just 20$. They are being unfair to you and your situation.", "You are NTA.\n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable request to ask for money to pay for food and transportation. Especially if you are hard up for money. \n\nIt's good you had the courage to ask as you may have been stuck being out of pocket every time you baby sat the kids. \n\nMaybe explain that you simply can't afford to watch the kids with no help? I doubt your friend would be angry if they truly new how hard up you have it. Sometimes people who aren't struggling for money don't realise how bad it can be.", "NTA. When I was growing up my parents never left my sister and I in someone else\u2019s care without offering to cover their expenses (transportation, food, activities etc.) . It didn\u2019t matter if it was a paid babysitter or a family member or friend doing them a favor, my parents felt that they were solely  responsible for feeding and entertaining their kids. Your friends need to realize that you are doing them a favor by not charging for your time but they\u2019re taking advantage of you by not covering the costs you incur when their kids are with you.", "NTA.\n\nWatching someone's kid isn't a favor, it's babysitting. If you do this they should give you money to feed their kid and pay for any extra costs incurred because you're wat hign the kid.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise is just using you.", "NTA. So what are the favours they do for you \"between friends\"?", "INFO - Is she doing \"favors\" for you that are in any way equivalent to having her kid's sleepover, and footing the entire bill?\n\nNTA, but I think maybe it's the way you worded it. \"I would love to but I really can't afford extra expenses right now, since I'm out of work.\" That would have prompted her to offer money instead of you asking.", "NTA \n\nYou should begin charging them to always take care of their kids. If you are feeding them/transporting them/ or doing any extracurricular activity that may involve spending money. They should be giving you that money. You are essentially shouldering the cost of their children for a handful of hours, without being compensated for it.", "NTA\nThose aren\u2019t your friends. They\u2019re taking advantage of you.", "Yeah it\u2019s a favor to look *after each others kids* as in a babysitter co-op. \n\nIn that case, expenses even out.\n\nYou are child free. How exactly after you getting repaid on your \u201cfavor\u201d?\n\nI pay my babysitter and my kids eat my food. Like a parent does because we signed up for that.\n\nNTA. Ask for $40.", "NTA \n\nand she is not a good friend just looking for a free babysitter. My bff is basically a sister to me. We call each other chosen sisters because both our families suck. I am also off work right now for medical disability. She hates asking me to help with her kids. When she does, it's a need, and she is practically throwing money at me(even though i say no every time or that it's too much). I spend it all on her kids, and we have an amazing time. Even when I offer to help her by picking them up at school because she's a single mum and sometimes she can leave work on time. She will still send me money to go by them a snack or something before I bring them home. \n\nI have a question OP has your \"friend\" helped YOU at all while you've been struggling? How often do you see them when it doesn't involve kids? \n\nAlso, she's using the kids to manipulate those feelings in you, and that's disgusting.", "NTA. It's not a favor between friends, she's dropping them with you to avoid paying a babysitter $80+", "Definitely NTA.  I wouldn't even dream of not at least offering to buy the meals for the household watching my kid overnight.  Is it expensive? Absolutely.  But my friend/family member is doing me a real solid, so I absolutely must make sure to show them that it is greatly appreciated.", "Unless she is giving favors back this relationship is very one sided.  \n\nGo back to charging baby sitter rates.  You could use the cash right now.  NTA", "NTA - Sorry, but what are they doing for you?  Sounds like you are providing a significant service for them and how do they reciprocate?  Friendship is supposed to be two-way.  You don't need to keep score but it should be approximately even.  That is why they call it give and take.", "favors mean they'd be repayed, since you have no kids then this is just free baby sitting.\n\nThey should totally be offering to pay for dinner for you and the kids while you do this favor for them.

She is having a laugh.", "NTA, they're taking advantage of you. Especially if they know your situation. A paid babysitter would be at least 5 times that for a weekend. And they would be at their home using their food.", "NTA. Once or twice is a favor. She is their on call baby sitter and they are awful to not be already paying her for all the gracious help she is providing.", "Shit, ask for more than that. I pay my friends way more than that if they\u2019re watching my kids and there\u2019s no reciprocity.", "NTA a good friend knowing your situation would swing you a hundred bucks to help you out", "She behaves as if she does OP an favor that she can watch their children. \"You let me have childfree time and i let you see my children. See, favor for favor\"\n\nNTA", "You can have zero kids and watch other kids as a favor.    Even if she was doing it as a favor, Her friend is rude AF assuming she can drop off her kids at a disabled friend\u2019s house and not even think about how her friend would pay for their food and activities.   Selfish bullshit.", "Ask for $40 per hour. NTA", "Not to mention that OP is doing them this \"favor\" while being chronically ill to the point she can't work anymore!", "THIS!\n\nWhat favor is she doing for you?! You\u2019re providing free child care and covering food/expenses for another persons child. \n\nDefinitely NTA and I don\u2019t know if I would watch her kids at your place anymore.", "My husband typically works from home and I am a sahm, but it ended up Thursday I had a scan where I wasn't allowed to have my toddler and my husband got called into the office. I got my neighbors to watch my toddler until I could get home and I tried to bring food or pay them and they refused. But I couldn't imagine knowing that they were living super tight due to medical issues and being put out that they asked for money to feed my kid. Like.... What drugs are OP's friends taking that they feel not only entitled to OP's time, but that OP should cover food costs.", "Especially given that OP's financial circumstances have changed. Way too many people try to justify not paying child-free friends, family members, etc because \"they have spare cash since they don't have kids\", but what's their excuse with people like OP who have gone into difficult financial times?       \n    \nAnd you know that if OP refuses to babysit without some kind of compensation she's going to get painted as the mean auntie we don't talk to anymore.", "This is it!  Ask for the going rate of babysitters going forward.  Knock off $10 if you want.\n\nWhat I have noticed in life is the people that are in friendships that do favours for each other, it\u2019s a reciprocating amount of times and probably would be the people that would know your situation so would offer you money, or order pizza to your place for dinner, or drop off groceries, or do something.  The people who will never do a favour for you in return will always call it a \u201cfavour\u201d and guilt trip you. When\u2019s the last time you asked for that big of a favour from her and she did it?\n\nPlease take care of yourself and do not back down from asking for payment", "I'm sure the friend is well aware of the cost of babysitters. The  bare faced cheek to complain about 20 to cover costs **knowing** ops situation. \n\nThis isn't about favours. This is the friend taking advantage of op, relying on their good nature to buckle. What a shit friend.", "If my friends offer to watch my kids for free, you better believe I give them a fun money budget so that they don't have to use their own money on top of their own time to entertain my kiddos! Having people who will watch your kids for free is such a blessing and I'm shocked that OPs friends aren't doing everything they can to make sure they have the best time with their kids as possible!", "For a night or weekend? Strong emphasis on the \"+\" there", "Yep. NTA.", "It's not only that, but I'm sure her friend is aware of her personal situation. She is not asking for payment, she is asking for costs so she can provide for the kids whilst she looks after them.", "I'd be more honest... \"Sorry, I can't afford to do that kind of favor at the moment\"", "No I don't think it's the wording at all, you were right the friend is using her. I just commented about my experience. It's a very similar situation, the difference is my friend knows how big that ask is and will provide without asking. ( but a lot of fighting on my part because she provides too much sometimes) I always use it on the kids and they have an amazing time.", "What are you currently getting from this friendship.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/Speciadghfc is a scammer!  **It is stealing comments** to farm karma in an effort to \"legitimize\" its account for engaging in scams and spam elsewhere.

Regardless of the persons income.", "A friend can still ask for money for the basics while watching their children. A friend just means you're most likely not paying for their time. It doesn't mean that you just expect them to cover childcare costs while they're being watched. Just like you wouldn't expect the friend to cover diapers/wipes/extra clothes, etc, you wouldn't expect the friend to cover food.\n\nEdited: spelling.", "Wtf kind of sense does this make? Back when my kids were in the hands of a babysitter, I paid them to babysit, and I provided anything my kids would need. Food, activities and a change of clothes. Even if my kids stayed overnight with family, I still sent them with food and such, especially if I knew that person was in any sort of hardship. Anyone who considers themselves a friend would do this without having to be asked and without the guilt trip.", "This. Sounds like she\u2019s possibly on disability as well, so if she\u2019s on a fixed income even worse that her friends send their kids over with no money for food or transport AND they don\u2019t pay her", "It really does sound like OP is a free babysitter and not an inner circle friend. \nOP bow out of the next few babysitting gigs. Just say you\u2019re not available, no details. See if they call you or not. Then you know where you stand.", "ESPECIALLY since the person knows her financial situation and actually needs the money to get by. The OP could be babysitting for actual money to pay for her living expenses.", "I pay my teenager $15/hour to watch his toddler sister. The entitlement to demand OP watch these kids for free. \"You're getting the chance to spend time with my precious babies. You should pay me.\"- OP's friends, probably", "I\u2019d tell them okay, you need to get a different sitter then. Which will cost them a LOT more than 20 or 40 dollars. OP is being used for free childcare and taken advantage of. Really they need to stop and tell them they can\u2019t afford to take care of their children. I understand they want to be nice and feel guilty but they need to take care of themselves first.", "It should be more because they ate too.", "Exactly.\n\nI would totally help a neighbor in this case. And not ask for anything.\n\nBut if you called me up for weekly date night?\u2026.then show me the $$$.", "Totally agree with you. My kids are now young adults (26 & 22 and they have no kids themselves)  and so the way I see it - I am child free as of 4 years ago and yes I may have a \"little bit of extra money\" to myself now which i use to indulge myself and how dare anybody else wanna try to count my pockets? (of course, whenever the kids need a little help I always got them \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaf) but they are the ONLY ONES who can come ask me for some money!!! \n\nOP is NTA, and please stop letting your \"friends\" take advantage of your kind nature and heart. Just think: when have they taken the real time to do something nice for you, just because? You're always doing it for them though and they don't appreciate it one bit.", "Maybe it hasn't sunk in for the friends yet. Maybe I'm passive aggressive, but I would spell it out too clearly for them: if I cover food for your kids for the evening, I will have to skip 2 meals myself. That's how right money is for me. You know that. So are you cruel or dense?", "The friend isn't just looking the gift horse in the mouth, she is taking it out back to turn into glue. She's maybe saving $20 but also gambling hundreds of dollars worth of free labor", "This is what we do too. Also OP is a great care taker. Is so hard to find someone that we can trust not to abuse the kid. OP should charge more. NTA", "Where I am (Sothern California) that would be for 4 hours with reasonable expenses. If it included taking them on public transportation and buying a happy meal it might be for 2 hours.\n\nNormal here is $15/hour per kid plus any large costs, and a flat fee of $100 - $150 for an overnight. Being the godmother might mean a little discount", "I think you misread my comment.  I meant it as the friend is mad that op doesn\u2019t want to be out of pocket to babysit her kids for free.", "At the very least make it bet neutral for them so they\u2019re not actively losing money to do the favor of watching the kids. Who doesn\u2019t offer to send food or money for food with their kids?!", "I would insist on paying in that scenario, honestly. Bring everything the kids need, plus some, and pay. OPs friend is taking advantage of her.", "Oh gosh yes - the guilt. I felt like that - that I could no longer do the things I used to. And help in places / things I used to. And I used to apologise. \n\nBut that\u2019s not your fault. Anymore than it was mine. \n\nYour circumstances have obviously massively changed - like mine - and yeah, you do find out who your friends are. \n\nTurn it around. All this help you\u2019ve given in the past - would they help taking you to hosp appointments; go shopping for you on a bad day, cook for you etc? \n\nI also get the embarrassment having to ask for money because you can no longer provide as you used to - I\u2019ve done that also. True friends are mortified if they\u2019ve not realised how bad it is. \n\nMost of all - I\u2019m so very very sorry - welcome to the chronic illness world where you do find out who your friends are. If you ever want to chat, feel free to message me. You are NTA / they are TA\u2019s\n\nEdit: and thank you for your good wishes towards me also !!", "Did you've showed up then someone asked: \"Who wanna have this illness?\". No, of course not. So its not your guilt!", "NTA, I am also chronically ill and an auntie by friendship. My best friend literally won't let me mind her kids for free. She gives me \u20ac40-80 for six hours which is completely unnecessary but also very much appreciated as she and her husband both have good jobs and I rely on government assistance because I can't work. I have tried to refuse payment and she won't let me.", "Please re-read what you have posted and commented from a stranger's perspective. They moved away, but you're still the go-to for babysitting... with zero regard to your illness or your current financial situation. That's NOT friendship. At this point, it seems like they are taking advantage of you because it's free, not because you're family.", "Sounds like it has become a very one sided friendship since you got sick. Nta. She seems to only value your friendship when it's convenient for her.", "Those aren't favours she is doing for you, that's just normal friendship.\n\nHowever, now that they moved and you are ill, it sounds like you get nothing (except seeing the kids, which only you know how to value) in exchange for being a free, on-call babysitter. She is doing you no favours and doesn't sound like a very good friend (anymore).\n\nI would absolutely say \"I can't afford to babysit as a favour anymore, I am happy to watch your kids, however I will require x$ and hour plus 20$ for food\"\n\nI'm sorry you are ill, and losing part of your support system, that all sucks. Don't let them take advantage of you, please.", "Did you payed rent or for your meals aso?", "That wasn\u2019t vague at all. It was completely clear.", "Frankly, if she were a truly thoughtful friend, she would already be concerned over your financial situation even if you've tried to hide it. She must know that you're ill and not working. Any of my friends would have been offering all kinds of assistance to me as well as handing me money whenever I took their kids.\n\nI am also childless and have been adopted as an aunt to countless children. Every parent has always offered to cover expenses whenever I took their kids - even when I was doing well financially and made it clear it was my treat. But, when money was tight, I accepted the help.", "Not vague, and I wouldn't consider that person a friend either.", "It\u2019s not too vague. Your \u2018friend\u2019 is being dense on purpose. This has nothing to do with wording etc etc. Your friend is an arsehole. Ignore comments suggesting \u2018it\u2019s the way you worded it\u2019 you did NOTHING wrong in asking for money when you are babysitting HER CHILDREN. Which seems to happen quite a lot from what I\u2019m reading. This isn\u2019t a favour, this is a job you\u2019re not getting paid for.", "NTA This might be tough because she is so used to you watching her children and paying for everything. But, you will have to put your foot down and talk sternly with this parent/\"friend\". You are allowing her to walk all over you at this point, and she expects it because you've been doing it for X amount of time. \n\nFriends don't ask their friends to wear themselves thin (especially when suffering financial and health hardships) for the sake of doing favors for them. (FYI this isn't just a favor anymore). It's simply not the way healthy relationships work. \n\nSo speak up, and don't allow her to take advantage of you anymore. If she can't respect that, then she's not a true friend.", "A loving family would continue to take care of you even if you were ill. \n\nIf she truly saw you as a third parent, and she knew that you were ill and not able to work, she would be calling to see how you\u2019re doing, offering to take you to the doctor, etc.\n\nAnd she certainly would not expect you to feed her children out of your bare cupboards.", "Exactly this! It\u2019s alarming that people are seriously regarding friendships as an excuse to leech off other people. If a friend is doing you such a huge favor for free, you thank them profusely and send them a bottle of wine/goodies/whatever along with the kids, not guilt trip them. And you always cover any expenses.", "Yep and if she\u2019s in the US my understanding is that disability is a pittance.", "For many years I was part of the family (as I don't have one myself) and we spent meals, holidays and every birthday together. Her kids are amazing and I always felt priviledged to be in their lives.", "Noooo, I was agreeing with you. I maybe just wrote it in a way that it wasn't clear \ud83d\ude1b", "I\u2019d like to reiterate this from an outside perspective. I\u2019ve watched my sister on a downhill slope trying to keep her friends, who do not treat her kindly. They all have children and she\u2019s child free which was all fine until she started getting diagnosis after diagnosis. As she could no longer physically support by going to see them, doing activities or making things, she started going into debt trying to make up for it financially. She\u2019s still trying to work so she had some money but zero energy and often very ill health. After buying a house she couldn\u2019t afford to financially make up for, in her head, her inability to be a \u2018normal\u2019 friend. It was her 40th birthday a couple of weeks ago and not one of that group turned up to her party, got a gift or sent a text. She felt like a bad friend not being able to do what she used to do. But once she wasn\u2019t useful they all dropped her. It\u2019s been awful seeing this happen over the years. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your friends are this bad but I hope guilt doesn\u2019t cloud your judgement. You don\u2019t have to make up for anything. You deserve to have supportive friends who adjust to your new normal and different expectations. It\u2019s unreasonable to think you can carry on as you were. You\u2019re NTA and I hope you have others who are supporting you."]}
