Whenever I watch my niece or my friends' kids, their parents slip me some money for whatever we might do to cover both me AND the kids.  If I don't use it all, I offer it back at the end, but I don't think anyone has ever taken it.  \n\nIt's different when you also have kids and so you're trading playdates and presumably coming out roughly even on costs, but when you're watching their kids, they should be making sure you're at least breaking even.  Polite to cover your costs as well so you are getting free meals/treats/activities for your time with the kids (especially if they aren't paying you hourly for your time).  Your friend is using you for free childcare and freebies for her kids, and that really sucks considering she knows your situation.", "What favors do they do for you?", "Nta.  This woman is out to lunch, you\u2019re doing free babysitting for her, she knows money is tight and she\u2019s mad you don\u2019t want to spend your money to watch her kids.  You don\u2019t have kids so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s returning the favour she\u2019s just using you.\nI would decline next time she wants to send her kids over to you.", "NTA. Under no circumstances should anyone **ever** expect free child care from anyone else. If you have someone in your life you trust with your children\u2019s welfare who is willing and able to provide free childcare for you from time to time, then that\u2019s a fortuitous bonus. And for a time, you were both willing and able. Now that you\u2019ve lost your livelihood, you remain willing, just less able. You shouldn\u2019t have to come out of an increasingly limited pocket to do your friend a favor. The fact is she\u2019s a parent, and childcare is one of her parental responsibilities. If you weren\u2019t willing to do it for $20, her other options would be to pay a stranger way more than $20, or stay home. It isn\u2019t just that you\u2019re not an asshole, she\u2019s being a giant asshole.", "NTA - what is her end of the \"favor between friends\" and if it really is just to see her kids lmao nope you're not free service. My best friend is who my kid calls auntie, but I still pay her a going rate if she's gonna watch the kid.", "NTA- don\u2019t let her guilt you into thinking you\u2019re going the wrong thing. She\u2019s exploiting your good nature for free babysitting and she definitely knows what\u2019s she\u2019s doing. I feel like every comment on this is going to say what I am saying and if it does, I would suggest showing your friend this. She is lucky to have someone as accommodating as you are. Babysitters are not cheap and a 20 for resources given to her kids is not asking for much and in truth she should be giving you much more than that.", "NTA. You're doing a favor to her by giving you her time and babysitting for free; she should pay expenses incurred. Most people pay $20+/hr for babysitting these days.  As a friend, she should recognize your situation and offer to pay you for helping her out. I think she's fallen into the habit of taking advantage of your friendship and taking advantage of you.", "NTA. But your friend is. Its more than enough you take their children, but doing it on your dime is insane. Parents know to always bring food and everything their child will need, not just giving cash and making you take them to the store with you to feed them. Your friend is RUDE.", "NTA.  Asking for a bit of cash when babysitting is entirely reasonable, doubly so when you have to feed them.", "INFO: she says favour between friends but it seems completely one sided and has moved from possibly once being a favour to an obligation. What are you currently getting from this friendship? What's the quid pro quo?", "NTA - and my heart goes out to you. Before becoming chronically ill myself ( I have one son) I did a lot for others, other kids, ( far too long to describe here) and had the money to do all sorts \u2026. \n\nBut then I got badly ill. And it took me a long time to sort out ESA and PIP ( disability benefits I\u2019m UK) And believe me you find out who your friends are when you\u2019re no longer able to do as much. Or when you need help. Or when you can\u2019t finance the things you used to.\n\nYou are NTA OP - but your friends are TA\u2019s. You\u2019re chronically ill, can\u2019t work, limited money & they still expect you to take their kids - for \u201clove\u201d. They\u2019re using you. Sorry, but they are.", "NTA - Your friend should be grateful that she's not having to pay for a babysitter, you're being a good friend, and if she's as good of a friend as she should be, she shouldn't complain when you ask for some extra money, it's not like you're asking for hundreds of dollars.", "NTA", "Nta. If she asks again for child care say that you can come to their house, or it will be $xyz for snacks and activities and you know your friend understands that because you are not working you have time to help, but not the extra cash to put out for snacks and fun things.", "NTA", "NTA. Child care is so expensive nowadays. They should be *Thankful* that you are doing this for them, even for just 20$. They are being unfair to you and your situation.", "You are NTA.\n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable request to ask for money to pay for food and transportation. Especially if you are hard up for money. \n\nIt's good you had the courage to ask as you may have been stuck being out of pocket every time you baby sat the kids. \n\nMaybe explain that you simply can't afford to watch the kids with no help? I doubt your friend would be angry if they truly new how hard up you have it. Sometimes people who aren't struggling for money don't realise how bad it can be.", "NTA. When I was growing up my parents never left my sister and I in someone else\u2019s care without offering to cover their expenses (transportation, food, activities etc.) . It didn\u2019t matter if it was a paid babysitter or a family member or friend doing them a favor, my parents felt that they were solely  responsible for feeding and entertaining their kids. Your friends need to realize that you are doing them a favor by not charging for your time but they\u2019re taking advantage of you by not covering the costs you incur when their kids are with you.", "NTA.\n\nWatching someone's kid isn't a favor, it's babysitting. If you do this they should give you money to feed their kid and pay for any extra costs incurred because you're wat hign the kid.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise is just using you.", "NTA. So what are the favours they do for you \"between friends\"?", "INFO - Is she doing \"favors\" for you that are in any way equivalent to having her kid's sleepover, and footing the entire bill?\n\nNTA, but I think maybe it's the way you worded it. \"I would love to but I really can't afford extra expenses right now, since I'm out of work.\" That would have prompted her to offer money instead of you asking.", "NTA \n\nYou should begin charging them to always take care of their kids. If you are feeding them/transporting them/ or doing any extracurricular activity that may involve spending money. They should be giving you that money. You are essentially shouldering the cost of their children for a handful of hours, without being compensated for it.", "NTA\nThose aren\u2019t your friends. They\u2019re taking advantage of you.", "Yeah it\u2019s a favor to look *after each others kids* as in a babysitter co-op. \n\nIn that case, expenses even out.\n\nYou are child free. How exactly after you getting repaid on your \u201cfavor\u201d?\n\nI pay my babysitter and my kids eat my food. Like a parent does because we signed up for that.\n\nNTA. Ask for $40.", "NTA \n\nand she is not a good friend just looking for a free babysitter. My bff is basically a sister to me. We call each other chosen sisters because both our families suck. I am also off work right now for medical disability. She hates asking me to help with her kids. When she does, it's a need, and she is practically throwing money at me(even though i say no every time or that it's too much). I spend it all on her kids, and we have an amazing time. Even when I offer to help her by picking them up at school because she's a single mum and sometimes she can leave work on time. She will still send me money to go by them a snack or something before I bring them home. \n\nI have a question OP has your \"friend\" helped YOU at all while you've been struggling? How often do you see them when it doesn't involve kids? \n\nAlso, she's using the kids to manipulate those feelings in you, and that's disgusting.", "NTA. It's not a favor between friends, she's dropping them with you to avoid paying a babysitter $80+", "Definitely NTA.  I wouldn't even dream of not at least offering to buy the meals for the household watching my kid overnight.  Is it expensive? Absolutely.  But my friend/family member is doing me a real solid, so I absolutely must make sure to show them that it is greatly appreciated.", "Unless she is giving favors back this relationship is very one sided.  \n\nGo back to charging baby sitter rates.  You could use the cash right now.  NTA", "NTA - Sorry, but what are they doing for you?  Sounds like you are providing a significant service for them and how do they reciprocate?  Friendship is supposed to be two-way.  You don't need to keep score but it should be approximately even.  That is why they call it give and take.", "favors mean they'd be repayed, since you have no kids then this is just free baby sitting.\n\nThey should totally be offering to pay for dinner for you and the kids while you do this favor for them.  NTA", "It\u2019s a favor when you watch her kids, then she watches yours. That would be balanced. This situation is not. $20.00 for babysitting is a steal!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You say they're *aware* but perhaps don't actually stop and think that even just the $20 to buy the kids a happy meal can be a bit stressful in your current situation if you're reliant on social security income.", "NTA-  Your friend sucks, you shouldn\u2019t even have to be in the position to ask.  My own siblings always try to give me spending money for my nieces and nephews when I take them out regardless of my financial position.", "The favor is watching the kids for free, not paying for their stuff out of pocket. You're not profiting from this, NTA", "NTA, they are using you for free babysitting, if they had to ask another babysitter then they would be expected to pay them, so yes they should pay you as well. \nHaving extra mouths to feed when you are on a low income can cause money issues for yourself where you may have to make sacrifices.\nSince you are only asking enough to cover those extra expenses your \"friends\" are still getting a good deal.", "NTA. You are providing free childcare already. It\u2019s nuts that she\u2019s guilting you over not having enough extra in your budget to both watch AND feed AND transport your kids on your dime. \n\nThe favor you are offering is one of time, not of money, and she sounds totally ungrateful for that! I often buy the food or send my kids with food when friends or family watch them, even for an afternoon.", "NTA - it doesn't sound like they expecting a favor so much as free childcare. Since you have no kids of your own for them to return the favor, asking for a small amount of money to cover food, etc. is not unreasonable at all. \n\nNext time she asks, I'd plan on being \"busy\"", "NTA. My kids have friends who's parents are not as well off as we are. When their kids stay with us, I pay for everything. When my kids stay with them? I throw them cash to cover expenses because they simply cannot afford to pay for 2 extra kids.

You wouldn't be an asshole if you didn't have your financial situation you 100% aren't with your situation and the fact that you were gracious enough to share. You are doing a service that can cost 25/hr plus cost of food.", "NTA - Free babysitting for the weekend and complaining about having to cover expenses means she's not your friend. She's using you. In my area babysitting 1 child is $15+ per hour. Giving $20 is a complete bargain. A weekend of babysitting can easily run hundreds of dollars, even with an agreed upon flat rate.", "NTA\n\nThe \"favor\" is only asking for $20 to watch two children for several hours.

Yes, it's a favor, and favors are not obligations or requirements, but a kindness that the receiver should be thankful for. You can also easily choose to *not* provide this favor if it doesn't work for you anymore.\n\nA $20 bill? They are lucky they aren't paying $250 a week at a daycare. If they would prefer that, then bye.", "NTA...It shouldn't take a genius of a friend to see that you may be struggling financially.
