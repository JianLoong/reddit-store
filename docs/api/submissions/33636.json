{"id": 33636, "submission_id": "18paw3h", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to confess her marital status?", "selftext": "A few weeks ago my wife(31) met a man (age unknown). I(33f) don\u2019t think how is very essential but I was home with our baby(6mo.). How she paints it- the initial exchange was purely professional as it ought to be considering the *place* she met him but even so it isn\u2019t at all unusual for her to come home with a new number or new connection in one way or another. She tells me and told me right away about it and a few days go by before the texts begin. \n\nAt first they don\u2019t seem professional, they seem friendly. She tells me so and I suggest she come clean that she isn\u2019t single. She takes that as \u2018put this guy in the friendzone\u2019 by putting \u2018friends\u2019 into the conversation with statements like \u2018never can have too many friends\u2019. But by the texts she reads me it\u2019s evident he\u2019s not getting the clue or is very resistant placement in \u2018the friendzone\u2019. \n\nA couple days ago he asks for pics. She sends him one with her and a dog of ours and tells me with a prideful chuckle in her tone so I get annoyed. I told her to just f-ing tell him that she\u2019s married and she glares at me like I sucked all the fun out of recess. \n\nShe told him and like I suspected the conversation went from flirty back to respectful and the messages stopped. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: My wife is very tomboy/butch when she\u2019s not in a professional setting but has to wear feminine suits to work- this is how she was dressed when she met this man. I don\u2019t police her phone- she\u2019s very open with her \u201cawkward\u201d interactions. She doesn\u2019t entirely know how to react when people hit on her solo and often doesn\u2019t realize when it\u2019s happening, I being the more flirty between the two of us pick up on the conversation undertones much quicker- she\u2019s the type more likely to fight a person hitting on us than accepting the attention normally\u2026 \n\nHer reasoning behind not wanting to tell him was the fact that it\u2019s a somewhat professional setting. She doesn\u2019t work with him. Long story short she went to court and he was opposing her position.\n\nFor those thinking she\u2019d cheat on me or that these are clues we lack passion, I do have to admit things have slowed a bit after baby. Those first 2 weeks were chaos and we were very much sleep deprived. Sex was the absolute **last** thing on my mind for a couple weeks but the intimacy never stopped and has become physical again.

If she's going as far as getting attention from other men it sounds like she's not feeling happy. Having a new baby can be hard, maybe she's feeling some self esteem issues and his flirting was making her feel better about herself. Now that doesn't mean what she did was right, but it does mean a therapist would be the best help right now for this situation vs anger.", "My (33m) wife did something similar years ago and kept insisting there was nothing to it and just friends. I told her to imply u want more to the person and see how the other person reacts and of course they wanted more and she was baffled. I had to explain to her that although she didnt consider herself beautiful or anything that many others do and she needed to realize it because the whole situation made me very uncomfortable. I didnt tell her 'not to do' anything. Just explained how i felt and it worked out", "ESH. It is weird to be in contact with someone for so long without at least mentioning your kid or spouse. I don't think you need to \"come clean\" about it, but they usually come up in casual conversaion by now.\n\nI only put ESH because you seem to be policing her interactions with others to a strange extent from what I read here? maybe i'm misinterpreting it.", "NTA - This is weird to not tell someone you've met that you're married. This seems like the beginning of an emotional affair between your wife and this other man, and she seems to be flaunting it with you.", "NTA I would have taken the phone and texted it myself", ">She doesn\u2019t entirely know how to react when people hit on her solo and often doesn\u2019t realize when it\u2019s happening\n\nOh no she realized alright \n\n>A couple days ago he asks for pics. She sends him one with her and a dog of ours and tells me with a prideful chuckle in her tone so I get annoyed.\n\nShe knows what she's doing. I'd be suspicious this is not the first time she's played along for some attention. NTA.", "There was clearly something happening there. What exactly, I can\u2019t say. \n\nTwo possibilities come to mind:\n\n1. Maybe she was trying to get you excited. Some men enjoy having men pursue their wives. Does your wife have reason to think that you might? Or perhaps she wanted to get you hot and bothered and maybe get busy with her yourself. \n\n2. Maybe she is thinking of entering the HotWife world. Do you or she have fantasies of that nature? Does she follow subreddits of that kind?\n\nIt sounds like she was sharing what was happening, and not attempting to hide it from you. Whatever is happening, or that she might want to happen, it sounds like she wants you involved. Communication is the most important thing. Be clear about your boundaries as well as your fantasies. Find out what her fantasies and boundaries are. Don\u2019t assume or accuse. Talk.", "NTA. She enjoyed both his attention and your jealousy. That's really crappy.", "She was having an affair in front of you.", "Nta\n\nGood for you guys for having mutual visibility into the messages to begin with.\n\nI'm sure it did feel good to have a dude flirt with her knowing full well she'd never do anything \n\nBut I understand your frustrations with it\n\nSeems alls well that ends well", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing \u201efun\u201c about flirting with some dude behind your spouse\u2018s back, nor about stringing along some guy who\u2019s interested in you. Your wife doesn\u2019t sound like a great person.", "NTA. she was gonna jump on that. She still might.", "NTA! But your wife is a real piece of work! Clearly disrespectful in the relationship!", "YTA\n\n  \nStop being controlling and jealous, that makes you an AH.", "NTA tbh she is being unfair to both of you.", "NTA. But your wife is being very sus. Just friends? Bull. She is either up to something or wants to be up to something.", "NTA\n\nYou need to have a very serious conversation with your wife, because this is definitely a betrayal of you and your relationship.\n\nIf it was reversed? How would it be then?\n\nBeing giddy that someone is interested in you is very different from specifically keeping info from them to keep that interest. And if the guy didn\u2019t care she was married? It\u2019s completely unacceptable and is no small thing.\n\nShe\u2019s damaged trust and this needs to be discussed until you resolve it, even if it means boundaries. Boundaries that she\u2019s certainly brought on herself.", "NTA\n\nAlso, clear warning here OP.  It's entirely likely this isn't the first time she's done this with someone... and you should seek couples counselling.  I won't specifically say 100% she's cheating on you with someone else, but this kind of behavior, behind another person's back (which the texts and such is) does run the risk of being that, or developing into that.", "NTA\n\nyour wife is either fancying a fling, planning on a fling or has had a fling.\n\nYou need to sort this out now.", "op she cheating. Run", "NTA\n\nBut your wife kinda is..  to him and to you...\n\nOnly redeeming fact is that she was honest with you all along...", "So , she was using him flirting as a legal tactic? That I would be ok with. \n\nIf it was just she enjoyed the attention I\u2019d be very unhappy.", "INFO: OP mentioned they are 33f, is your wife attracted to men at all? or just the attention?", "NTA. It sounds pretty clear that he was flirting and she was playing along. You asked her to stop, that's more than fair considering you're married. But, as others have already mentioned, be wary of her doing this again without you knowing.", "NTA\n\nShe's obviously been trying to hide her married status.  It could be entirely harmless. She might just enjoying attention that she isn't getting at home (*hint!*), especially with a new baby. That she's sharing all this with you is good.  That you're not getting the hints isn't so good.   You should ask her, gently.", "NTA - The fact that she was so resistant to telling him that she\u2019s married means that she liked the thrill of having the guy after her. Whether that would\u2019ve translated to actions, who knows, but she was definitely getting *something* out of knowing this guy was into her. Even if she didn\u2019t reciprocate. Could be that it was a confidence boost for her, after having delivered a baby only a few months prior that a guy would be interested in her.\n\nWhatever her reasoning here, it was inappropriate and disrespectful to you, the relationship, herself, and the guy. I think this is something you two need to seriously sit down about and discuss, that you want to understand *why* she wanted to present herself as available to this guy. Even if she had no intentions, why did she want to be seen as a possibility by this guy?", "Did she not have a maternity picture with you she could have sent? She\u2019s not really sending him the message that she\u2019s not available.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Calling someone a friend is not the same as clearly letting them know that you're married. It doesn't have to be within the first couple of texts, but it's not difficult to work it into the conversation. \" I'm looking forward to this weekend because I have plans to go to x place with my spouse!\"  \nIf she truly wasn't interested in this man, and did not want to be pursued by him in this way she would have made it known. I think you waited a very reasonable amount of time and you asked politely at first. She was being willfully obtuse, so you had to be direct.", "Why would she send him a picture?", "> *\"She doesn\u2019t entirely know how to react when people hit on her solo and often doesn\u2019t realize when it\u2019s happening\"*\n\nI find this often hard to believe.  So few people would fall into this category. And, even if it ***were*** true, and this is was her stated reason why she hadn't told him yet, then she shouldn't have resisted telling him when you let her know he was obviously hitting-in/flirting-with her.\n\nIn my view, she's clearly gaslighting you: \"hurr durr didn't know he flirt\".\n\nAnd, when given the opportunity, flirts with men.  Frankly, whatever you and your wife have agreed on for picking up strangers of the opposite sex and giving them their numbers, (which I find odd, but you do you), it seems like she's crossing the line.\n\nWho TF doesn't know that when a guy asks a woman they just met for pics that it's clearly sexual?\n\nAgain, IMO, she's looking outside your marriage for that \"high\" of flirting, probably b/c there's something wrong in your marriage.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is though, to both you and the dude in question.", "NTA\n\n  \nYour wife though...           I dunno. I'd be worrying about all the things I don't know about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
