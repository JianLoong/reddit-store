It\u2019s not unreasonable imo", "She\u2019s not getting a work warning, she\u2019s getting a gym warning. If she chooses this hill to die on, she\u2019ll get banned from the gym, not fired. But she should probably wear a shirt anytime she\u2019s anywhere in her workplace\u2019s building.", "We're going to have to disagree here. \n\nBeing told the rules when you don't follow them, and the consequences for not changing your behaviour is being informed. \n\nBeing given a warning after breaking a rule you are aware of, is getting in trouble,  \n\nThis is my stance and how I've coached and managed for 20yrs.", "I can see that, thanks. Do you have a point?\n\nFrom the context of the post, we can see that the title is a simplification, which is to be expected. I don't think many people would say she was an AH simply for wearing a sports bra at the gym.", "Just because people wear them that way, doesn\u2019t make them \u201ctops.\u201d There are tops with built in bras, but that\u2019s not just a bra.", "There are ones that have an attached top over top. I don't think that's what OP is talking about because bystanders would see it as a top.", "Thats how the entire company loses access to the gym and they company stops giving perks.", "A sports bra is an undergarment, attire goes over undergarments.", "Not in just a sports bra.", "Presumably because nobody wore underwear as a top to the gym and they didn\u2019t think they needed to make that clarification \n\nMy gym requires clothing. There\u2019s no specific clause that says that my briefs don\u2019t qualify, but I\u2019m quite certain people would complain and they\u2019d end up clarifying that rule further if I showed up and worked out in briefs\n\nThere\u2019s also probably no stipulation in the employee handbook that you can\u2019t wear  at shirt with pictures of multi listed animals on it at the gym, but there probably *is* language about \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201coffensive\u201d clothing, and if you were such a t shirt they\u2019d further clarify what that language means too", "you\u2019re right\u2014 that\u2019s how it goes, unfortunately.", "I said that they look closer to a normal bra (underwear) than to a crop top. \n\nThis does not mean that they look exactly the same as a normal bra.", "Tbh I\u2019m larger chested and fall out of bras regardless", "but what we\u2019re discussing here is an issue where OP has been explicitly told to follow a certain standard and is digging her heels in because she finds those standards unfair", "It doesn't need to be documented, and it has been communicated. Did you not read op? Her boss is communicating very clearly what needs to change.", ">OK, but that needs to be documented and communicated\n\nNo, that is definitely something you should know without being told.", "Obeying the rules is exactly what's being talked about here, dummy. She wasn't obeying the rules. That's why her boss had to talk to her about it.", "\"Common\" does not matter at all. This is a single physical location with its own rules.

And if you\u2019ve got the confidence to do it. I\u2019m in a small town and it\u2019s usually leggings and a baggy shirt\u2026 even some hoodies! Don\u2019t even tend to see many guys in the muscle fit shirts which is normal it seems in other gyms.", "I've seen some sports bras that absolutely look like strip club clothing.", "There was no suggestion the boss fight, at all. Just a suggestion the boss ask for a clear statement of the dress code - shared publicly- to clarify the situation and avoid future issues. A fairly managerial response.", "The OP could just as easily ask for the rules to be posted.  Written rules covers the building management from arguments and potential litigation.  Arbitrary rules are bad for everyone.", "I was an instructor at a university in a college town - so I totally get it. But I\u2019m not going to not have fun just because other adults might run in to me.", "Then around 95% of all people I See at the Gym are \"total morons\". I only wipe it after I use it. If everyone does this, everything is fine. And tbf you wont die from a bit of fresh sweat someone left there 5 min ago.", "So what? I Just said, that the mere existance of sanatizer is no reason for gyms not to have a dresscode that bans only sportbras or muscleshirts, cause lots of people are dogshit", "Sports bras are not undergarments in a gym.

I worked at a gym. 99% of the clients were in sports bras.", "When the waiver she signed when getting access to the gym just specified she must wear \"athletic or workout clothes\", then yes, it needs to be documented.

The waiver she signed just said \"workout or athletic clothes\". IMO, if they want to enforce different rules, then those rules need to be documented and communicated out.", "The point is that no one told her until just now. It was never written or spoken. The published dress code says \"athletic attire.\" But oh, not certain types they don't like, but they don't list em?\n\nNo, you're completely misrepresenting the problem here. The problem is she was judged/scolded and felt shamed for following the published rules in a way someone didn't like. She's not arguing that she should still be able to wear those clothes, but asking whether she was wrong for assuming it was okay, and whether it was an asshole thing to do in the first place with no rules specifically stating it was not allowed.", "The only guidelines were spelled out in the waiver she signed, it said one must wear workout or athletic clothes. Are running shorts and a sports bra not athletic attire? She was told after the fact, after five months that they don't consider running shorts and a sports bra athletic attire.

They can change the dress code every 5 minutes if they really want to.", "Notice how in this thread everybody except you and OP have intuitively grasped this very basic piece of etiquette?\n\nThat should probabably tell you where the common sense part comes in.", "But someone complained enough that the gym management felt like they had to escalate to her boss. Their gym, their rules. I wouldn't be surprised if the new waiver specifies a top over any kind of bra.", "Yes, absolutely. BUT as far as I can see she's still arguing the toss about it once it HAS been pointed out. That is just not smart.", "> Management should have addressed the topic with HER after the FIRST damn complaint\n\nOh yes, absolutely.   (Although given how weirdly defensive OP is, I wonder if they DID and she ignored it   - but I'm obviously basing that on nothing concrete and am probably being unfair)", "The gym management sent the complaint to the entity that they have a relationship with, her company.", ">snitching\n\nYour word choice tells me your mindset.", "!\n\nI'll alert the media", "Yes, and any change in policy still needs to be communicated if it's something the gym members/employees initially agreed to on gaining access to the gym. Expecting people to adhere to uncommunicated standards is insane. Especially when there's already a communicated standard.", "Probably because it's a gym, and their waiver only specified \"athletic or workout clothes\". If the gym or the company have different expectations, then those need to be communicated PRIOR to an employee getting in trouble for wearing what in any other place are workout clothes.", "Except that it seems they're still trying to enforce unwritten rules. Which is just weird to me.", "Wouldn't you get defensive if people were \"complaining\" about your body? I put it in quotation marks because I don't think there were any actual complaints. I think building management just didn't like it. I wouldn't qualify with probably, you are being unfair.", "They may have never explicitly wrote \"make sure the wear a shirt\" before. But guess what, now that an issue has come up they are communicating they would prefer everyone to wear a shirt.", "Wasn\u2019t an email sent companywide on attire?\n\n\nI mean, even if the guidelines are specific enough for her liking, they already gave her, the luxury of telling her that a bra isn\u2019t good enough.. given the email. No further action would be required.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s better to quit while you got the benefit of the doubt, trying to make this an issue isn\u2019t going to be something applauded.. you should only be difficult when it\u2019s absolutely necessary", "But she didn't get in trouble, she was merely told to wear more appropriate clothing", "That\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t TA for doing it before the rule was clarified.

I'd still be wrong of course.", ">she was merely told to wear more appropriate clothing\n\nWhich goes against the rule she agreed to on the (usually) legally binding waiver she signed.\n\nIf they want to enforce specifics when it comes to clothing, that's fine. But they need to update their written rules and communicate out that change.", "Because refusing to adhere to someone saying the rule is one thing, when the written rule is something else, isn't being an AH. It's going by the actual rules. If they want the rules to exclude sports bras without any sort of covering, that's fine, they can do that. But they need to specify that in the rules the gym goers agree to when they sign the gym waiver, and they need to communicate out an updated copy of the rules.", "With respect I disagree, advocating for yourself is never the wrong thing."]}
