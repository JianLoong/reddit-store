I(25f) have been with my husband (30M) for 5 years, Ever since I've known him he has always been a \"know-it-all\" kind of guy, but he is has other amazing qualities, and that's why I married him. \n\nFor background information: He is a \"know it all\" about literally every single thing. I am a very passive person, so for 5 years, I have been able to either ignore it, brush it off, and so forth. This man will mansplain, I'm talking he critizes that I wipe wrong after I pee, that I didn't do dishes in the right order, I should be ovulating now because my period was x days ago, etc. You get the picture now. Also he always has to tell me \"how all men think.\" This is important.\n\nNow onto what happened yesterday. We have this neighbor who has lived beside us for 3 years, she's in her 40s. She lives by herself, and I have never had any problems with her until very recently. The entire 3 years, my husband would always mow her yard every time he mowed ours too, and he would even take the time to carefully weed eat around her flowers and not hurt them. My husband is also a very handy man, so he has always fixed things for her too. \n\nAt first, this didn't bother me, because my husband is a genuinely nice guy, but the past 6 months I have asked him to stop doing things for her because of how she has responded to it. For example, me and my husband were sitting on our deck, and she walks up, she totally ignored me, and only acknowledged my husband, and proceeded to thank him and only converse with him. This happened a few more times after that, where she would ignore my entire existence and only converse with him, even after I would say something to her. Then she started to bring my husband gifts (fresh basked bread, fruit and veggies from her garden) and one time when I was even at work, she brought our son a bunch of toys she claimed were from her neice (but they weren't as she forgot to take the tag off and I saw it.) Anyway, this sent my senses off, I asked my husband to stop I told him I really think she's got other intentions and he's sending the wrong message, he totally ignored me and brushed it off. \n\nYesterday he mowed her yard again, weed eated it again. Something in me just snapped. Once he was done and was walking back onto our deck I yelled at him. My exact words were \"Don't you ever tell me how a man thinks when you won't even listen to me about how a woman thinks.\" Then he called me jealous and said it was uncalled for. And no I refuse to speak to him. It's been a whole day since I've said a word to him.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683129964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136rkbv/aita_for_finally_snapping_at_my_husband/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jeez, how passive are you? I was fed up with this guy by the end of your post. You\u2019ve put up with him for 5 years?", "NTA\n\n> I'm talking he critizes that I wipe wrong after I pee\n\nI'm sorry, WHAT?\n\nThis gave me the ick.", "NTA - Your neighbor knows exactly what she's doing... and so does your husband.", "NTA but really how surprised should you be that a man who criticizes you over your bathroom habits is heading straight for an affair? He's completely at fault for his actions let me be clear however you married him ignoring several red flags surrounding his behavior.", "NTA. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s already cheating. Bare minimum he enjoys the attention.", "You're asking if you're TA when you observed something, had a concern, voiced it to your husband, asked him to adjust his behavior, and HE IGNORED YOU?\n\nNTA.\n\nWhat was his response, however, when you first raised your concern to him and / or told him you didn't want her doing favors any longer? Did he agree, or dismiss it, or say nothing?\n\nYou seem like a generally accommodating and considerate wife. His assessment of 'unfounded jealousy' aside, you are reacting to actual behavior on her part that makes you uncomfortable, and that's reasonable. I suspect consciously or not that he might enjoy the attention and appreciation, and it's that that is causing him to refuse to adjust the dynamic.\n\nPS - Being understanding of his 'know it all' tendencies is one thing but it could also be a sign of a really toxic and troubling attitude he has towards you, it suggests a lack of respect for you and the knowledge / expertise you have (ie, about your own body FFS) that could manifest in other ways in your marriage.", "NTA. He sounds intolerable. And you only  used his own line back at him.\n\nAnd I also think you are right to be jealous: they are having an emotional affair. Probably why he blew up, because you caught him. Honestly, I'd let her have him, and move on with your life, find someone who respects you and isn't a grotesque parody of a sexist.", "NTA But this seems like the bigger issue\n\n>he critizes that I wipe wrong after I pee, that I didn't do dishes in the right order, I should be ovulating now because my period was x days ago, etc\n\nHowever inappropriate his relationship with this woman may or may not be it seems immaterial compared to the consistent pattern of behaviour he's shown towards you", "I understand you\u2019re passive however some of this stuff is a little crazy... how you wipe? Um what?? If the neighbor wants him, you may want to let her have him. \n\nYou could just speak directly to the neighbor. You definitely should be speaking to her when she\u2019s ignoring you. Obviously, there\u2019s some issue with this woman but it appears your issue is with her. I\u2019m not sure how mowing the lawn & weeding is sending the wrong message. Your husband still sounds like an ah. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis guy sounds awful. How you've been with him for this long is beyond me. He has to stick his nose in your business, but god forbid you question his.\n\nHim not respecting a boundary you've set is a huge red flag. Especially after you pointed out the kind of behavior this other woman is showing.  I wouldn't talk to someone who dismissed you like that either.", "NTA\n\nYou should really reconsider your marriage. You know he's not going to change, at the very least any time soon. Can you really see yourself dealing with a \"know-it-all\" husband for the rest of your life? Personally, I wouldn't be able to last a day with any person like that. \n\nIf your feelings and opinions aren't being heard and flat out rejected, then this isn't going to be a healthy marriage for you.", "NTA. I feel like he may have looked for someone young as he would be able to manipulate them (sorry). To find someone at 20 who \u2018knows more\u2019 is great sure but not if they are controlling and condescending to you in regards to it. He doesn\u2019t know everything and have effectively stopped you from learning things on your own. \n\nHe is TA and it truly seems like he would touch her with a 50ft pole as he\u2019s getting a huge ego boost from the neighbor lady who YES is trying to move in and play stepmom after you two separate due to these issues.", "NTA. I was honestly hoping you didn\u2019t have kids with this man and then I got towards the end thought damn! If a man EVER told me even one of the things you mentioned in your example I would lose my shit. This is crazy. Then I saw that he would have been 25 went he met you at 20? He seems like the type to have to feel he is in control of everything. Massive fragile ego. I\u2019d recommend counseling together and separate TBH. This behavior of his is who he is at this point and one argument and ONE pushback from you in five years will not change him. Good luck. If he refuses, then you have to ask yourself if you are willing to put up with that forever. Because by staying with him, you are showing him you are willing to tolerate that crap.", "NTA\n\nI was fed up and not even through the majority of the post. Stop being such a doormat. Be firm and tell him you know women's intentions, and if he so much as allows her to disregard you and disrespect you like she has, you won't hesitate to head for divorce because he's been warned of her intentions and her intentionally leaving you out of conversations and such is just rude.", "NTA. Always trust your instincts, especially when it comes to other women. This neighbor's behavior is unseemly and you are right to be concerned. You are also right to tell him not to tell how a man thinks. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself. Keep doing it - it sounds as if it may come in handy someday.", "Is it even an appropriate sub.\nLooks like the start of an emotional affair.\n\nNTA definitely.", "Stop wasting your life with this idiot. Or you can wait to leave him when you catch him fucking the neighbor\u2026", "NTA. I think your point was well taken. He knows how \u201c all men think\u201d but you know little or nothing about how women think. It appears you know more than the know it all to me.", "NTA - I was, emphasis on WAS, married to a man like that. We were married for 4 years and thank God we didn't have any children.", "NTA but maybe you should let her have him?", "I think your feelings are justified. You let him know how you felt and he ignored you, he shouldn't have done that. I will say that snapping at him probably wasn't the best look but you told him how you felt and he didn't change his actions so I understand where you're coming from. As his wife, I think you are allowed to request that he doesn't talk to someone you suspect has other intentions (within reason, like don't do that to every person your husband meets) AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THE SAME if the roles were reversed. The toxic side of me says to do a test on her >:) like have your husband call her and see if she'd be down to \"meet up\" behind your back and see what she says", "I mean you married this guy knowing full well the kind of guy he is and now you're mad that he's acting the same he always has? YTA to yourself", "Maybe slow down on your conclusions, maybe she is not comfortable around you yet. Maybe she seems distant cause she is nervous that you may think she is trying to have an affair when really she is just trying to repay the favor. Or maybe she doesn't know you and is nervous. I'm saying this because I do the same things she does. I interact with people I KNOW. Just because someone is associated with a perspn I like, doesn't make me comfortable around them. \n\nI might chat away and laugh with one person, and completely ignore the other person and not even look at them, because I am nervous. I look calm but really my brain shuts down if I try to interact with the other person who I don't know very well. I literally cannot think sometimes if I get nervous.", "if you do the silent treatment: YTA.\n\nThis is a simple disagreement. You have written this incredibly biased against your husband. \u201cFinally snapping\u201d and describing him as a \u201cknow-it-all\u201d.\n\nIt seems like he\u2019s in the habit of doing something kind for someone who he feels needs the help. You think he should stop doing it because you imagine this person has ulterior motives. Perhaps you can find a way to solve this problem through communicating. The silent treatment isn\u2019t going to get you there.\n\nThere are so many better ways to handle this issue than just demonizing your husband, assuming the worst about your neighbor then going silent treatment.\n\nIn this story, with your bias subtracted - all that has happened is that your husband is in the habit of doing something kind, and he got public gifts (not private or personal, but gifts of a household nature) and your son gift gifts from the neighbor. She could be trying to hit on him - or she could be grateful and trying to reciprocate kindness.  \n\nYou say your neighbor treats you coldly - perhaps you\u2019re unfriendly to her and she senses that. It seems you don\u2019t think highly of her from this entire account. \n\nOr maybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s hitting on him.\n\nEither way, YTA. I wish you\u2019d try to talk to your husband and your neighbor and solve this issue instead of shutting down. The lawn cutting isn\u2019t really the problem. The problem is you don\u2019t really trust your husband or your neighbor. The problem is you and your husband can\u2019t communicate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But to turn the question, WHY should she bring you baked goods? You aren't the one cutting her grass he is. And yes people donate toys with tags on them, we have posts in this very sub every single day about people doing exactly that because parents get piles of shitty toys for birthdays from inlaws.\n\nHer ignoring you is completely rude and I'm not even discounting the possibility she's into your husband.
