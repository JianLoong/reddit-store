I(25f) have been with my husband (30M) for 5 years, Ever since I've known him he has always been a \"know-it-all\" kind of guy, but he is has other amazing qualities, and that's why I married him. \n\nFor background information: He is a \"know it all\" about literally every single thing. I am a very passive person, so for 5 years, I have been able to either ignore it, brush it off, and so forth. This man will mansplain, I'm talking he critizes that I wipe wrong after I pee, that I didn't do dishes in the right order, I should be ovulating now because my period was x days ago, etc. You get the picture now. Also he always has to tell me \"how all men think.\" This is important.\n\nNow onto what happened yesterday. We have this neighbor who has lived beside us for 3 years, she's in her 40s. She lives by herself, and I have never had any problems with her until very recently. The entire 3 years, my husband would always mow her yard every time he mowed ours too, and he would even take the time to carefully weed eat around her flowers and not hurt them. My husband is also a very handy man, so he has always fixed things for her too. \n\nAt first, this didn't bother me, because my husband is a genuinely nice guy, but the past 6 months I have asked him to stop doing things for her because of how she has responded to it. For example, me and my husband were sitting on our deck, and she walks up, she totally ignored me, and only acknowledged my husband, and proceeded to thank him and only converse with him. This happened a few more times after that, where she would ignore my entire existence and only converse with him, even after I would say something to her. Then she started to bring my husband gifts (fresh basked bread, fruit and veggies from her garden) and one time when I was even at work, she brought our son a bunch of toys she claimed were from her neice (but they weren't as she forgot to take the tag off and I saw it.) Anyway, this sent my senses off, I asked my husband to stop I told him I really think she's got other intentions and he's sending the wrong message, he totally ignored me and brushed it off. \n\nYesterday he mowed her yard again, weed eated it again. Something in me just snapped. Once he was done and was walking back onto our deck I yelled at him. My exact words were \"Don't you ever tell me how a man thinks when you won't even listen to me about how a woman thinks.\" Then he called me jealous and said it was uncalled for. And no I refuse to speak to him. It's been a whole day since I've said a word to him.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683129964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136rkbv/aita_for_finally_snapping_at_my_husband/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's completely at fault for his actions let me be clear however you married him ignoring several red flags surrounding his behavior.", "NTA. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s already cheating. Bare minimum he enjoys the attention.", "You're asking if you're TA when you observed something, had a concern, voiced it to your husband, asked him to adjust his behavior, and HE IGNORED YOU?\n\nNTA.\n\nWhat was his response, however, when you first raised your concern to him and / or told him you didn't want her doing favors any longer? Did he agree, or dismiss it, or say nothing?\n\nYou seem like a generally accommodating and considerate wife. His assessment of 'unfounded jealousy' aside, you are reacting to actual behavior on her part that makes you uncomfortable, and that's reasonable. I suspect consciously or not that he might enjoy the attention and appreciation, and it's that that is causing him to refuse to adjust the dynamic.\n\nPS - Being understanding of his 'know it all' tendencies is one thing but it could also be a sign of a really toxic and troubling attitude he has towards you, it suggests a lack of respect for you and the knowledge / expertise you have (ie, about your own body FFS) that could manifest in other ways in your marriage.", "NTA. He sounds intolerable. And you only  used his own line back at him.\n\nAnd I also think you are right to be jealous: they are having an emotional affair. Probably why he blew up, because you caught him. Honestly, I'd let her have him, and move on with your life, find someone who respects you and isn't a grotesque parody of a sexist.", "NTA But this seems like the bigger issue\n\n>he critizes that I wipe wrong after I pee, that I didn't do dishes in the right order, I should be ovulating now because my period was x days ago, etc\n\nHowever inappropriate his relationship with this woman may or may not be it seems immaterial compared to the consistent pattern of behaviour he's shown towards you", "I understand you\u2019re passive however some of this stuff is a little crazy... how you wipe? Um what?? If the neighbor wants him, you may want to let her have him. \n\nYou could just speak directly to the neighbor. You definitely should be speaking to her when she\u2019s ignoring you. Obviously, there\u2019s some issue with this woman but it appears your issue is with her. I\u2019m not sure how mowing the lawn & weeding is sending the wrong message. Your husband still sounds like an ah. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis guy sounds awful. How you've been with him for this long is beyond me. He has to stick his nose in your business, but god forbid you question his.\n\nHim not respecting a boundary you've set is a huge red flag. Especially after you pointed out the kind of behavior this other woman is showing.  I wouldn't talk to someone who dismissed you like that either.", "NTA\n\nYou should really reconsider your marriage. You know he's not going to change, at the very least any time soon. Can you really see yourself dealing with a \"know-it-all\" husband for the rest of your life? Personally, I wouldn't be able to last a day with any person like that. \n\nIf your feelings and opinions aren't being heard and flat out rejected, then this isn't going to be a healthy marriage for you.", "NTA. I feel like he may have looked for someone young as he would be able to manipulate them (sorry). To find someone at 20 who \u2018knows more\u2019 is great sure but not if they are controlling and condescending to you in regards to it. He doesn\u2019t know everything and have effectively stopped you from learning things on your own. \n\nHe is TA and it truly seems like he would touch her with a 50ft pole as he\u2019s getting a huge ego boost from the neighbor lady who YES is trying to move in and play stepmom after you two separate due to these issues.", "NTA. I was honestly hoping you didn\u2019t have kids with this man and then I got towards the end thought damn! If a man EVER told me even one of the things you mentioned in your example I would lose my shit. This is crazy. Then I saw that he would have been 25 went he met you at 20? He seems like the type to have to feel he is in control of everything. Massive fragile ego. I\u2019d recommend counseling together and separate TBH. This behavior of his is who he is at this point and one argument and ONE pushback from you in five years will not change him. Good luck. If he refuses, then you have to ask yourself if you are willing to put up with that forever. Because by staying with him, you are showing him you are willing to tolerate that crap.", "NTA\n\nI was fed up and not even through the majority of the post. Stop being such a doormat. Be firm and tell him you know women's intentions, and if he so much as allows her to disregard you and disrespect you like she has, you won't hesitate to head for divorce because he's been warned of her intentions and her intentionally leaving you out of conversations and such is just rude.", "NTA. Always trust your instincts, especially when it comes to other women. This neighbor's behavior is unseemly and you are right to be concerned. You are also right to tell him not to tell how a man thinks. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself.

We were married for 4 years and thank God we didn't have any children.", "NTA but maybe you should let her have him?", "I think your feelings are justified. You let him know how you felt and he ignored you, he shouldn't have done that. I will say that snapping at him probably wasn't the best look but you told him how you felt and he didn't change his actions so I understand where you're coming from. As his wife, I think you are allowed to request that he doesn't talk to someone you suspect has other intentions (within reason, like don't do that to every person your husband meets) AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THE SAME if the roles were reversed. The toxic side of me says to do a test on her >:) like have your husband call her and see if she'd be down to \"meet up\" behind your back and see what she says", "I mean you married this guy knowing full well the kind of guy he is and now you're mad that he's acting the same he always has? YTA to yourself", "Maybe slow down on your conclusions, maybe she is not comfortable around you yet. Maybe she seems distant cause she is nervous that you may think she is trying to have an affair when really she is just trying to repay the favor. Or maybe she doesn't know you and is nervous. I'm saying this because I do the same things she does. I interact with people I KNOW. Just because someone is associated with a perspn I like, doesn't make me comfortable around them. \n\nI might chat away and laugh with one person, and completely ignore the other person and not even look at them, because I am nervous. I look calm but really my brain shuts down if I try to interact with the other person who I don't know very well. I literally cannot think sometimes if I get nervous.", "if you do the silent treatment: YTA.\n\nThis is a simple disagreement. You have written this incredibly biased against your husband. \u201cFinally snapping\u201d and describing him as a \u201cknow-it-all\u201d.\n\nIt seems like he\u2019s in the habit of doing something kind for someone who he feels needs the help. You think he should stop doing it because you imagine this person has ulterior motives. Perhaps you can find a way to solve this problem through communicating. The silent treatment isn\u2019t going to get you there.\n\nThere are so many better ways to handle this issue than just demonizing your husband, assuming the worst about your neighbor then going silent treatment.\n\nIn this story, with your bias subtracted - all that has happened is that your husband is in the habit of doing something kind, and he got public gifts (not private or personal, but gifts of a household nature) and your son gift gifts from the neighbor. She could be trying to hit on him - or she could be grateful and trying to reciprocate kindness.  \n\nYou say your neighbor treats you coldly - perhaps you\u2019re unfriendly to her and she senses that. It seems you don\u2019t think highly of her from this entire account. \n\nOr maybe you\u2019re right and she\u2019s hitting on him.\n\nEither way, YTA. I wish you\u2019d try to talk to your husband and your neighbor and solve this issue instead of shutting down. The lawn cutting isn\u2019t really the problem. The problem is you don\u2019t really trust your husband or your neighbor. The problem is you and your husband can\u2019t communicate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Front to back keeps poo from getting in your urethra and vagina both, which isn't healthy to have in either. That's a fact and you're wrong, sir.", "Dabbing,  OMG did this get off track.\n\nOP you are NTA.", "Its not that I think that's the true story - I said \"could\" and \"example\"\n\nI just mean a different viewpoint could perhaps change the shades of this story - especially considering the core behaviors at work here.", "\"Untainted\" (snickers like Beavis and Butthead)", "For sure. But without reliable data, how can we justify telling one anyone they\u2019re doing it wrong? If you have a patient with recurring UTIs it\u2019s absolutely something to explore, and if you have a kid it\u2019s worth teaching the ftb way, but if you just know a 40yo btf wiper who has never had a uti, who is any of us to tell them they\u2019re doing it wrong?", "The average perineum is, what, an inch? Two inches? And it\u2019s all mashed together between your legs in a warm, humid environment, all day long. You think there isn\u2019t a ton of bacteria all over there no matter how you wipe? The vagina is a rich ecosystem and is very capable of handling some bacteria. Unless you are literally wiping from A to V in one motion, you\u2019re probably not introducing much more bacteria than was already there. Some, yes. Enough to make a significant difference? The jury\u2019s out, but some urologists and what data we have say\u2026 probably not. \n\nThe problem, really, is getting it up in your urethra and not flushing it out regularly enough. That\u2019s why sex and dehydration, and factors which prevent frequent full emptying of the bladder, are major causes of UTIs. Wiping direction rarely even makes the list of common causes.", "There\u2019s no reason to even suggest the neighbour could be disabled unless you\u2019re trying to foster sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic character. \n\nMaybe OP kicks puppies in her spare time, I dunno.\n\nAll I really need to know is she expressed discomfort to her husband, he blew her off and kept doing it. The rest, whether you believe it or not, is just gravy.", "OP also admits to giving her husband the silent treatment for days after snapping and losing her temper - instead of communicating like an adult.\n\nCouples are going to disagree.

Idk if it takes therapy or what, but you need to start speaking up not just to the husband but to anyone that tries to walk all over you. People will continue to do what YOU let them get away with - and that includes letting your neighbor know that if she has a problem addressing you with respect on YOUR PROPERTY then she can stay over on her side of the fence.

But you are married to one. Being a know-it-all is different than being a walking fact book who shares information. One is generally regarded as an AH who loves to hear themselves talk and be superior, and the other is someone people enjoy because they share fun or interesting facts. Your husband is the first option. I don't know if you realize this but your husband telling you you wipe yourself wrong and how men think all time and dismisses your feelings are  pretty good indicators that he has no respect for you as a woman or a person?", "Simple solution, you do the yard work for you home from now on.

The fact he didn\u2019t act will just keep encouraging her that she has a chance and he doesn\u2019t like you much. \n\nThe truth is probably that he wants it both ways, he wants you jealous but gets mad when his actions rightfully make you made. Your post alone telling you how to wipe and how a man thinks already made me believe he\u2019s a misogynist but the way he blew up as if you should put up with anything he YOUR HUSBAND does is crap.   \nHonestly why are you with such an Asshole it must be exhausting. He\u2019s already proven he does not care how his actions affect you. He seems to feel he should be worshipped like a god from a number of women \ud83e\udd2e.
