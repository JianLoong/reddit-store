I totally get that you\u2019re not having fun with it! You don\u2019t have to. It was nice that you tried. \n\nAt this point- yes. Your husband is being a bit controlling about it. Mine has never suggested trading certain players unless I specifically ask for his help! He will suggest where I can go to research but ultimately let\u2019s me make my decisions.\n\nSorry for the rant. My point is. Your are NTA.

I said that I picked my players at the start and I just wanted to leave my team the way it was\n\nTypically in fantasy football, you select your own team of players and setup a lineup every week. I might be wrong but it sounds like you picked your team but didn't login again. Some men take fantasy football very seriously so passively playing might come off like you're not trying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said it wasn't fair to the other teams if I just wasn't managing my team and then I was just setting everyone else up in the league for wins (which I don't think is accurate because I had pretty good players, but that's beside the point).\n\nI don't think it's fair for him to hound you about managing your team (adding and dropping) without explaining why he thinks you should do it. I'm sure if he explained the importance of setting your lineup following the players (injures, stats), you'd be more inclined to actively participate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm still learning how to play and I'm never going to learn if he does everything for me. \n\nI think it would helpful if you communicate how you learn so he can teach you vs. giving you the answers.", "NTA but with that being said you should probably listen to him a little and it also is unfair to the league if you're dropping top players.

I'm a big fan of fantasy football and when a player stops managing their team, it makes it less fun and competitive for everyone. So while I don't think you have any obligation to let your husband manage your team or even ask him for advice at all, I do think you have an obligation to try to field the most competitive team you can with whatever knowledge you have. It sounds like you are trying to do that though, so as long as you keep doing it, I would ultimately say NTA.", "ESH. Why are you both digging in on this?! What a silly thing to argue about.", "Lol.

You should be able to see for each player what percentage of leagues a player is on a team versus left on waivers. So if a guy is on a team in 90% of leagues that's a good indication you should hold onto him. Even if he's out hurt for a game or two, or on a bye.

There will be weeks where your good players are just 0 because they dont play that week and you could have otherwise switched them out for a player on your bench or available in free agency or from the waiver wire. It kind of sucks for everyone and ruins the experience. I do think its better to at least make sure your lineup is set every week, even if that just means taking 5 minutes to make sure no one is on a bye. \n\nUltimately, I think you still are NTA because its a game that only really works when everyone wants to play and you were clear that you didn't want to do it.

A lot of teams will say their injured stars are questionable when they\u2019re planning on playing, to confuse the other team.

It\u2019s not only unrealistic but also unhealthy.\n\nWhile this particular issue is small, this same behavior with bigger issues would be very damaging.\n\nIt\u2019s time to have a more serious talk about his behavior. He has to accept that you are your own person who is allowed to enjoy and engage with something in your own way.", "NTA,", "NTA. First year is a learning year anyway. Tell him to watch The League (FX- Not I\u2019m Tv anymore)  and accuse him of COLLUSION.", "NTA sounds like he\u2019s ruining your game experience and his constant control over how you play is making the game not fun to you.", "He wants to win and is basically  cheating in my opinion. Hes trying to have two teams to play\n\nNta tell him to focus on his team", "NTA, but as someone with my own team, I do understand his POV. The fact is, having one manager in the league who doesn\u2019t at least try and ensure all their players are uninjured or not on a bye week can be seriously frustrating to everyone else. It does affect overall standings. Unless you start to like fantasy, I\u2019d skip this next year. (As I consider your husband the A H for pressuring you to do something you didn\u2019t seem to want to do much)\n\nAs for the guy you dropped\u2014\u201cquestionable\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean they\u2019re out, and even if they are, it may just for that week. Dropping an intensely valuable player just because he\u2019s questionable in the moment is short-sighted. He can come back and play excellently the rest of the season. Someone must\u2019ve been thrilled to grab your guy off the waiver wire. \n\nI don\u2019t follow the NFL either, but I do pay attention to the players. Try looking at stats like how many other managers are starting your guys this week, or how many other managers are picking up/dropping certain players. The major FF leagues usually show those stats. If you\u2019re dropping a guy that 95% of other managers are keeping, then think twice, etc.", "NTA - tell him he's being a nag.", "Don't even have to read it, YNTA.", "I'm one of those gals.\n\nMy partner and I have to play in different leagues so we don't split up.  I have no password on my phone, and my journal sits underneath the coffee table in my living room, but I have THREE passwords on my laptop cause that's where I manage my team.", "But she IS a newbie", "Ha ha.  I did a similar thing during March Madness and based my bracket on which teams had better looking coaches.  I also did surprisingly well--didn't win anything but I got further along than I thought I would.", "(Not relevant here since everyone knew about her lack of experience, but I'll elaborate.) It's fine to be a newbie, but if people let you into the league thinking you're experienced, it's not fair to them. Rookies throw off the competitive balance because they make random mistakes and thus compete differently against different teams. Imagine having a regular basketball pickup game and someone brings a player who's never played before. It wouldn't be that much fun.    \nNot really relevant here, but before the clarification it could have been.", "Gotcha. Yeah the one brief line of \"he got upset\" didn't make it seem like it was much of a big deal but if he keeps getting mad about it, then yeah it's a problem.", "\u201cLol I hate women lol jk\u201d", "Funny. Just not as funny as mine. Mine had some sting to it, didn\u2019t it? Tends to happen when you keep it real. lol. No jk. \ud83d\ude0f", "Lol jk ur so funny lmao omg"]}
