But NTA, I think. \n\nP.S.

And a grandparent is 100% not in the position to have to shower together out of necessity, especially since it sounds like both grandparents were there. And sleeping together in underwear is beyond any possible explanation.", "NAH I guess. I see nothing wrong with this, but it\u2019s your kid and your choice. My family had baths/showers together to save hot water, walked around nude. People jumping straight to abuse is wild.", "NAH. calling it completely inappropriate is over exaggerating, when in fact it depends on specific cultural norms and individual boundaries. Where I\u2019m at, it\u2019s very normal for  grandma, aunties or mums to bathe with their kids. You\u2019re gonna get wet anyway when bathing the kid, so might as well bathe together. There\u2019s nothing sexual about it, as long as everyone shares the same bits. \n\nThat said, OP has the right to not feel comfortable with this. Though it might be better to have a conversation in person rather than through text, which can come across as cold", "Right?  When my niece was 6 I just had to check to make sure she got the shampoo out of her hair.", "How is she going to find that out if those boundaries are around sleeping and showering, if she stops the sleep overs?", "They are really prude in the US, it\u2019s crazy.\n\nI remember that we used to go swimming a lot back in my home country, and in the Schwimmbad we went to they only had group showers for some reason, so I took showers with both my mom and grandmom - and whoever other women were in there - until I was much older, and usually shared the family cabin after to get dressed.", "OP spent between the ages of 5-11 away from her Mother from what I read in her comments. And she did not shower with her Grand Parents either when she was away... It's in her comments history...", "My nephew is 9 when my sister got the bathrooms renovated they had eco friendly showers head. My nephew was scared so he wanted me to stay with him in the bathroom. I made sure that\u2019s what he wanted and that he was comfortable. Hehehe a week later he got over his fear.", "Not when they use up all the shampoos and conditioners making \"potions\" lol.", "That's not always a good metric, though. Young kids will often respond to \"Do you want to?\" with \"Yes\" in order to please the adult, not because they really want to, even when they are deeply uncomfortable.", "My mom is the EXACT same way from when I could remember she would walk around the house naked or almost naked and slept in the nude and I was so used to it and still am that I\u2019m like whatever and doesn\u2019t phase me at all that she still does it.", "Dito - German here\n\nNudity was never a big deal for us within family. We don\u2019t on purpose run around naked in front of each other, but if someone is changing clothes or is in the shower and someone else is walking in (has to use bathroom urgently or getting something), nobody is getting a heart attack. The American prudery around naked bodies is weird to me; nudity is not automatically sexual.", "I've made a few shampoo soups in my day! Oooo my Mom use to get mad mad lol....", "This! I\u2019ve had to limit shower times because of this (we have a tankless heater but my youngest will use a giant bottle of soap and still be dirty behind the ears because potions!)", "My little brothers were notorious for this. So bad that sometimes when making their \"potions\" in the bath it would get so bubbly that they would be hidden under the skyscraper of bubbles.", "OP=YTA because you are taking this WAY too lightly.\n\nIf your mother is doing THESE TWO things what else is she doing that is totally inappropriate?\n\nNO more overnights period.", "I grew up like this and was surprised to find out other families didn't do the same. glad you're trying to instill boundaries early on. it's a practice useful for so many things", "NAH I wanted to comment from someone that doesn\u2019t have a problem with nudity and was naked in front of my kids a lot. I never showered with a 6 yr old and anytime I\u2019ve ever slept with my kids, I wore pajamas. Even though they saw me naked plenty. I also would never be naked in front of my grandchild, unless we had gone to the public pool or something like that, even though I was in front of my children. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s good you set setting this boundary. I hope she responds appropriately.", "Granted I was older (8+), but my hippie mom gave me options on nudity. We had a family YMCA membership and went to a clothing optional hot spring and bathhouse. I could choose to wear what I wanted in the same sex areas and opt to avoid areas (steam room, hot tub) where others were fully nude. Nudity wasn\u2019t sexualized, but my mom did instruct me about red flags and maintaining boundaries. Even today, I shut down comments on my tattoos or body if in a clothing-optional spot. Autonomy and consent are important. \n\nI definitely think nudity + sexuality depends on the person. My mom is of an era where nudity wasn\u2019t always sexualized, but there were unspoken rules about ogling or commenting. Nowadays, entering a clothing-optional environment requires clear rules and consent. \n\nShrugging off nudity as non-sexual is no longer an option like our hippie elders. Ya just can\u2019t trust the creeps! And a 6yr old needs to be treated like it\u2019s 2023 and not 1969.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a grandma.  I wouldn\u2019t be naked or semi-naked around my grandkids.  It just wouldn\u2019t feel right?  Even for the babies.  Could be I\u2019m just old fashioned but if it feels yucky in your gut, take a second look.", "my grandfather\u2019s wife (not my grandmother, he remarried when my dad was well into adulthood) made me and my sister shower with her, both of us fully naked, until i was almost 8 years old. she never touched us inappropriately but even as a child it made me uncomfortable and as you can tell by the way i refer to her, we have almost no relationship to this day.", "Yeah... If that kid tells her teacher about grandma, there may be social workers visiting.", "Umm, no.  At 6 years old a child is more than capable of bathing themselves (baring physical/other impediments).", "I still showered with my mom (and sometimes slept in bed with her - she wore pjs, though) well up until I hit puberty. But it was because I was close and comfortable with her and she never made it an obligation and just always wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I liked showering with her because my mom and I talk a lot and we never stop talking so it\u2019s just more talking time AND she had a cool shower with a skylight in it. I grew out of it when I was ready and she never made me feel bad about it. I think it\u2019s up to those people, but honestly, a grandparent? I wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with that.", "Most 6 yr olds I know needed at least some level of shower supervision.", "Oh man that was so fun", "My mom throws a mumu on when she leaves her bedroom so she doesn't \"traumatize the neighbor's kids when they ride their bikes by\" but we don't really bat an eye. She's super ridiculously modest in public though so we like to tease her about her \"little nudist colony at home\"", "This. My mom walked around the house naked all the time, and she raised me to not be weird about nudity. She wanted me to grow up with the knowledge that nakedness does not equal sexual. Heck, my parents took me to a nude beach when I was a kid and I never blinked an eye because of it. Her one rule was that I didn\u2019t get to walk around naked or in my panties because of potential creeps looking through the windows. Which is entirely fair. If I wanted to spend the day in the house in my panties, the blinds had to be closed.", "Yea my mom would throw on a shirt and shorts once my brother was getting in his teens because he felt weird about it but I never did so she would cover for him but not for me which she even asked for years if I was okay with it. Honestly I think it helped me a little with body image my mother is a bigger woman and seeing how she felt about the way she looked made me feel like no matter what size I am in life it\u2019s going to be okay. Shit there was a time I was in middle school if it was just her and me at home I\u2019d be in my underwear and sports bra especially in the summer", "What? I imagine 4 kinds of wrong here", "Yeah once the boys started expressing discomfort she always made sure to be covered around them - us girls just don't care. I have to agree with the body image thing, my mom had six kids via c-section and she was proud she had \"the body to prove it!\"", "And that\u2019s on you. But it\u2019s not weird. Naked does not equal sexual and thinking it does is toxic and leads to a lot of toxic mindsets. It\u2019s actually been studied, and it\u2019s highly common in a lot of cultures to be comfortable with nudity. That\u2019s why nude beaches are more common in some countries and most are open to people of all ages. \n\nWe are born naked. It\u2019s not sexual to be in your birthday suit.", "NTA personally, the shower thing doesnt really bother me. I showered with my mom plenty of times and it stopped before i went through puberty. They shouldve asked mom first though. If its immediate family of the same sex at such a young age i dont see an issue AS LONG AS NO ONE IS UNCOMFORTABLE. The moment any party is uncomfortable it needs to stop. The sleeping in only underwear thing is really weird though. Out of all the times ive shared a bed with any female family member everyone has had pjs on. Thats inappropriate and a red flag.", "You live in USA? \n\nIn Finland and in most of world that would Be totally normal. We Even go to sauna naked together as famil, as most finns do. DD most likely Will stop coming with us when teenager, but coming again when she is older. \n\nAnd she crawled sometimes to sleep on same bed when she was around ~7.\n\nI dont know about Being asshole. Maybe not, but for me thats really weird way of seeing things.", "NTA. My spidey senses are going off\u2026", "I think the last time my mom bathed me was maybe 4 years old? And she was never naked. That\u2019s fucking weird. \n\nNTA", "NTA it\u2019s strange behavior, no one should be naked, semi naked near someone else\u2019s child at all. Rather than making rules you shouldn\u2019t let her spend the night anymore, and no unsupervised visits because better safe than sorry. \n\nAlso age 5-11 is prepubescent?

OP hasn't even told a friend or family member and gotten feedback that she's in the wrong or was rude - there isn't even a conflict about the tone!! \n\nit's a non conflict about a controversial topic just long enough for OP to say that that's not the actual issue", "I kind of agree this is situational. My grandma lived on the coast and we would do big family days at the beach. When we got back to her house (2 showers total) everyone would clamor for the showers first. Usually my sister and I would shower with grandma to save time and water. With 10 people needing a shower it made sense.

My grandpa told me that's not appropriate but my grandma wasn't home and my mom was at work and my dad lived in a different state and I apparently said \"it's okay you changed my diapers.\"\n\nMy grandpa told me when I was older, that  no one on my dad's side of the family had ever said that to me and the way I said it sounded like I was mimicking an adult. It creeped him out and shortly thereafter I stopped having to go to my mom's adoptive parents' home at all.\n\nListen to things your kids say.

But at 6 yo, maybe you have to turn the shower on to set the temperature (?), and remind them to wash all over and rinse out shampoo or something, but I would think they can essentially do it themself at that age?
