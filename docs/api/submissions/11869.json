That's completely inappropriate for your mom to be taking showers with and sleeping almost nude with your 6 year old! Even if nothing inappropriate is happening (she touching your daughter), that is very much not ok!", "NTA. My immediate response was \"no, that's weird\". There's a difference between supervising a child at bath time - which your daughter may or may not need, IDK - and joining her", "NTA for telling her, yet please follow it up with an actual face to face conversation. A text is ok but maybe a bit blas\u00e9.\n\nTalk to her about 'bodily autonomy', boundaries, and consequences if they don't do as you ask. You're going to have to be tough with this.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your text was rude & you have the right to draw these boundaries. It is definitely a boundary that needed to be put in place.", "NTA Holy cow. \n\nI would stop the sleep overs until I was sure my mom would respect the healthy boundaries established.", "NTA sounds very inappropriate and needs to be addressed", "I see a lot of people asking if you suspect abuse in some way to justify your text and that doesn't matter.\n\nYou're setting boundaries for your child and you don't need to have been abused (or have a suspicion that your child might) to do that. \n\nTotally NTA and I am SUPER interested in the response you get from your Mom.", "Your mother's judgement sounds quite poor.  You are NTA for telling her not to do this, but you really should consider limiting the time they spend together without you.  I doubt your mother is up to anything nefarious, but her judgement really worries me.", "NTA. A six year old is almost at the age of showering by herself. I was showering solo at 6 and only had to have my mom come in to check that I got all the shampoo out of my hair.", "NTA, don't care what her intentions where, both things at best come off as gross and at the worst very alarming", "NTA.\n\nThis is absolutely not normal\u2026 perhaps your daughter needs to spend some time apart from your mother. As a mom, I\u2019m extremely uncomfortable reading this and if it were me I know I would be livid to find out this was going on.", "NTA. You\u2019re acting out of love and concern. How does your daughter feel?", "NTA. Text isn\u2019t rude and this would probably boarder child abuse and would get a visit by child services if your daughter were to talk about his at school.  It needs to stop and quick. Good luck.", "Weird", "NTA. Gross! This is a huge liberty she took and assumed was ok.", "nta omg", "NTA.  Simply because I think it\u2019s your kid and you get to set the boundaries however I(34f with kids around this age) personally don\u2019t see an issue here.  Your mom raised you, so you are the best person to know if she is trustworthy or not.  But sinse you let your daughter sleep over there I\u2019m assuming you think she is.  Maybe you are worried that your mom is inadvertently grooming your daughter?  As long as grandma respects your daughter when she says she is uncomfortable with a situation, it shouldn\u2019t undermine the education you have provided and will continue to provide your daughter in that area.", "OP, have you had any reasons to suspect this would be some sort of abuse from your mom's side? Did she shower with you (assuming you are a woman, but maybe you are not) when you were a child?\n\nHaving a child take a bath is easy without getting all wet, but shower is a bit different. I remember having showers with my mom until I learned how to properly shampoo and wash my hair, which was long and I needed help with. At this age it isn't sexual, until the adults make it sexual. I am not sure if there is an AH here, I need more information.", "NTA\n\nThat is entirely bizarre for a grandparent IMO across the board", "NTA this is fucking *weird*", "INFO \n-\tDid I get that right, this topic has never come up and that\u2019s actually what you wrote? \n-\tDid your daughter say she was uncomfortable with it? Nudity isn\u2019t sexual for kids, so some would be happy and some wouldn\u2019t. I really need to know how *she* feels about it to judge this. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely an AH for the way you communicated. Not quite sure whether I\u2018d call your mom an AH over behavior that\u2019s certainly odd for many people but could just as well be normal for her. Showers at public pools are shared where I live and people are usually naked there, even amongst strangers. Sleeping in underwear is perfectly normal to many people and if nobody ever told your mom you and your daughter are uncomfortable with it, she\u2019s not an AH for doing it.", "Soft YTA, not for the boundaries you set, but for the way you did it. If you're worried for your daughter, you should definitely talk to your mom directly. If you're not actually worried, then just ordering her to change her behavior is rather rude.", "YTA for the text. Talk like a human being, it's your mom and not some nanny from the street.

You\u2019re allowed to set whatever boundaries you\u2019d like, but I\u2019d talk to your daughter too. Does she feel safe? Does she enjoy it? My daughter is 4 and a half and likes to have me shower with her. She prefers that over a bath most nights and it doesn\u2019t bother me either way. She also loves sleeping with my mom. My mom wears the same thing to bed regardless of who she\u2019s with (nightgown). If your mom usually sleeps in just her underwear, it\u2019s entirely possible she\u2019s just never thought anything of it. I would sit down and figure out what\u2019s really going on.", "I don\u2019t suspect it\u2019s abuse from my moms side.  I think it\u2019s more that my mom has an obsession with my daughter and trying to relive those years she didn\u2019t have with me when i was that age (between ages 5-11, i lived with my grandmother).\nI don\u2019t recall taking showers with my mom when i was a child either (yes I\u2019m a woman so yes you\u2019re right ).", "The topic of showering together has never come up but sharing a bed has (which i assumed my mom wore pajamas not just underwear).  I was ok with them sharing a bed, but i made an assumption my mom was wearing pajamas.\nMy daughter did not say she was uncomfortable with it.", "When someone is doing something I don't like with my child then yes, I will \"order them\" to change their behaviour. No discussion needed since grandma doesn't get a say, just don't do it.", "Ordering her to change her behavior?  She's bathing with his 6 yo ffs.", "I have a feeling we'll be downvoted but I agree.\n\nEither this is a big deal of inappropriate actions.  Or it isn't.\n\nIn either of those cases an accusatory text doesn't help.", "It is possible she is enjoying a moment now that she couldn't have with you at that age, but that doesn't have to be an obsession or to have unhealthy connotation. I don't know your relationship, but there is quite big difference between 5-11 years old - when you last lived with her prior you were young and unconditionally loving child, when you returned it was teenage years and mostly independent young adult.\n\nYou might have been a bit sharp in your txt and might want to talk it in person though as it might come out as if you suspected your mom in unseemly behavior with your daughter. But NTA, I think. \n\nP.S. It can be very specific to different cultures too, but in mine grandparents usually tend to be way more affectionate and gentle with their grandchildren, than they were as parents to their children. It is usually explained by the fact that the discipline is left to parents to set up ;)", "She may not know how to express that she\u2019s uncomfortable. This needs to be addressed face to face, it\u2019s inappropriate. If your mom cannot respect your boundaries then no more sleep overs.", "Then I\u2018ve got to go YTA on this. A very gentle one because it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re accusing your mom of anything, but that could\u2019ve been easily communicated in a way that wasn\u2019t rude. It\u2019s your kid, your rules, but they *don\u2019t* go without saying and when they\u2019re stated the first time it can absolutely be done in a polite way. \n\nPersonally, I\u2018d call and apologize for coming across in this rude, accusatory manner, while confirming that you do in fact expect your parents to be fully clothed around your child. Obviously, if they continue doing it now that you\u2019ve stated your boundaries, they\u2018d turn into AHs. But as of yet, they haven\u2019t done anything AHish.", "I agree that grandma doesn't get a say. However, in a functional family, where people actually care about each other, you don't need to give orders without explanations. For all we know, the mother and the kid are completely, innocently fine with nudity. If the PE has even the slightest doubt what her mother is doing isn't completely innocent, then a text isn't nearly enough, she can't let her daughter visit alone anymore.", "The fact that she did bring it up shows some level of discomfort. Kid might not even know that she does feel uncomfy, but I can't think of any other reason for it to have come up if it wasn't already lingering on her mind", "Did we read different texts?\n\nLaying out clearly defined boundaries isn't being rude. OP is clearly delineating what is acceptable (without attacking the Mom I might add) with their child and what isn't. \n\nDoing it in a text, also, is not rude.", "Exactly, she\u2019s thinking about it. Why is grandma sleeping next to me in only her underwear? Her brain is trying to process it. I would put a stop to this asap.", "Also, I can't believe that those boundaries have to be expressed.", "I\u2018m guessing we\u2018re reading with different backgrounds, leading us to different judgments. \n\nI\u2019m not criticizing the boundaries but found the text rude. And since the grandma didn\u2019t know before the text that she was violating any boundaries, I think rudeness was uncalled for. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Even if grandma is 100% innocent, this could confuse boundaries in her head. If Grammy does it, is it okay for another adult to do? I'm maybe overly-cautious, but it's a scary world for little girls. I wasn't taught boundaries for my body at that age. I had to learn \"the hard way\" we will say. It might not be a big deal, but don't wait for it to be one because by that point it's late", "My first wife told me that growing up, her family walked around the house fully nude. Apparently this is a thing in the Scandinavian country she was brought up in?\n\nSo while I agree with you, there are reasons why some people might find nothing wrong with it while others are like wtf.", "OP thanked them for watching the kids and then stated what was acceptable going forward.\n\nShe didn't yell at her mom, or say OMG mom how could you or attack her in anyway. The message was not rude.\n\nAre you saying the method of delivery (text instead of face to face) was rude?", "Right!! Let\u2019s not normalize children sleeping in the same bed with naked adults. I\u2019m sorry you had to learn the hard way, reading that was heartbreaking. We have to do a better job protecting children. Too many kids have to \u201clearn things the hard way\u201d and that\u2019s not ok. A very painful lesson to learn.", "Yeah, I\u2019m northern European and where I live, while families didn\u2019t walk around *completely* in the nude, just wearing underpants at home was definitely normal in most families when I grew up. If it\u2019s good enough for the beach, it\u2019s good enough at home. (Mind you, clothes-free beaches were also still popular back then.) People my age have mostly switched to at least adding t-shirts but I don\u2019t think many grandparents would expect pajamas to be obligatory. (Answering the door in underpants plus t-shirt is still fairly common here when someone drops by unexpectedly.)\n\nTotally agree grandma would be an AH to continue doing it now that she knows OPs boundaries, but I can\u2019t call someone an AH for violating a boundary they didn\u2019t know existed."]}
