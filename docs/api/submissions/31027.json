At the age of 8, my adoptive parents decided to take in a mentally disabled foster child. Since it was a newborn, no one really knew the extent of the disability.  \nGrowing up was kind of tough because of this. Ever since I've been able to make my own decisions, I've disagreed with my \"sister\" and my adoptive parents' beliefs.  \nHere's why: My \"sister\" was always the center of attention, and having beliefs forced on you doesn't feel like true believing. (It's not like we believe in unicorns just because they\u2019re in a My Little Pony commercial, right?)  \nThis all came to a head on my 18th birthday. They kicked me out, saying I was old enough to make it on my own. For the record, I was already pretty independent, earning my own money alongside school, because there wasn\u2019t much support at home. They were too busy with my foster sister.  \nThankfully, I was able to stay with a friend's parents that same day. They helped me get on a healthier path for the next three years until I was ready to move into my own place.  \nNow, I'm 33, a guy, and doing well selling designer jewelry from Europe in China. I also volunteer and support youth programs \u2013 things like student exchanges, tutoring, and advice hotlines.  \nSometimes, the local newspaper mentions my work, even my name. And guess who reads that paper? My adoptive parents.  \nRecently, they've been calling, texting, and showing up at my door.  \nThe reason? They're in a financial bind with all the global issues like inflation and wars. Plus, they're taking care of my now 25-year-old foster sister. She's mentally about 5 to 10 years old, doesn\u2019t really get social norms, and has two kids of her own. My adoptive parents are looking after them too since she can't.  \nAnd now, they want me to cover all their expenses.  \nAITA: So, am I wrong for not wanting to spend my hard-earned money on them after being treated poorly for years?", "created_utc": 1700069943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vyz2y/aita_for_refusing_to_financially_support_my/", "score": 1873, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to finance their life. \n\nBut wait, you kinda glossed over how the mentally aged 5, but physically aged 25 girl has two children.

Your not responsible for fixing their lives.", "The guilt is understandable and natural, but you\u2019re not obligated to give them anything - nor *should* you because they very much decided to rip the rug out from under you while you were getting on your feet.

So, raped.\n\nNTA. *No one* owes anyone anything.", "NTA but if your evaluation of your adoptive sister's intellectual/mental capabilities are accurate I would strongly suggest you placing a call to Adult Protective Services on her behalf/her children's behalf.

Tell them no, \u201cthey are old enough to make it on their own.\u201d", "NTA. They don't give a damn about you; they just want your money. I'd suggest calling adult protective services though if your sister has the mentality of between 5-10 and got pregnant twice.", "NTA. They kicked you out, they chose to sever their relationship with you, you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything for them. It serves you no benefit to entangle yourself with them, and could lead to an utter mess that will leave you with further trauma, as well as resentment.\n\nThe fact their foster daughter, who is mentally 5 to 10 years old, got impregnated not only once, but twice, is incredibly alarming though. These people sound negligent and irresponsible at best.", "NTA, you as the child was chosen to be left behind because their 'values' made them take in a child they clearly can't take care of and further allowed her to have children somehow which is questionable horrible considering she doesn't know social norms even at 25.", "NTA - They are old enough to make it on their own.

Anyone who has volunteered for developmentally disabled adults knows, you spend a lot of time keeping them off one another. Just because they are mentally 5 or whatever it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have the hormones of an adult. They still go through puberty, they often have an adult sized sex drive. It\u2019s complicated and people don\u2019t like to talk about it.\n\nEdit: additionally many parents are so unwilling to talk about this subject that they totally neglect to put their disabled daughters on birth control. Which is in my opinion the bare minimum effort a parent should take regarding sex and disabled dependant adults", "Contact social services. Someone raped that girl, probably a member of the family.

Although you may choose to set up an \"escape fund\" for the grandkids to help them GTFO at 18 in case they don't have the same level of support from the adults in their lives.

They failed you back when you were 8.  Doing right by you for 8 years doesn't undo the past 25.

I'd actually call for a welfare check on her and her kids.  Where I live this would be considered abuse.  Also look up glass children (healthy siblings of sick/disabled kids).

They already seem to feel entitled to what is yours, you giving them what they want only feeds that entitlement.\n\n It\u2019ll only affirm their delusion that your money is their money and they deserve it. Trust me babe, this is not a road you want to go down. It\u2019s a bad idea even if they were good people, it\u2019s an awful idea (and masochistic of you to say yes) considering the circumstances.

You\u2019re where you are in life despite them, not because of them. They never did you any favors, anything they did is the equivalent or less than you would\u2019ve have received in state care.

Often they were meant to be short term placements but some residents had been there for years.\n\nA man of 37 started a relationship with a 19 year old woman, he had the intellectual age of about 12 and she had autism and a personality disorder, she came across as a lot higher functioning then she actually was which used to deceive people assessing her and they classed her as having capacity for things that she didn\u2019t really have it for.\n\nThey started a relationship and had flats next to each other and they were both classed as having the capacity to have a relationship so no one could intervene. She was desperate for a baby but there was no way she could raise it, she\u2019d be classed as a danger to the baby and herself.\n\nWe managed to convince them into using contraception but at some point they obviously stopped it and she became pregnant, they were both convinced they could keep and raise the baby and it was actually heartbreaking watching her progress with the pregnancy. No one seemed to have the authority to tell them the baby would be taken into care, it was an absolute shambles and support staff were just told not to discuss the pregnancy with them.\n\nI have no idea why they were never separated, we (staff) were just always told they \u201chad capacity\u201d The woman used to self harm and fly into uncontrollable rages attacking staff and hurting herself, before she was pregnant we could restrain her but not afterwards.\n\nShe had the baby and during the pregnancy bought baby clothes, photo albums, baby books etc\u2026 she genuinely thought they would be able to raise it in their flats in the facility. It was absolutely heartbreaking when they removed the baby from their care, I quit my job soon after because it was handled so badly and so I\u2019m not really sure how they coped with the loss.\n\nThe sad thing is the woman was intelligent enough to be frustrated with her disability and the restrictions it placed on her, she used to cry and say all she wanted was to be normal and have a family and she was desperate to be a mother. The man unfortunately was on the sex offenders register for having relationships with young teenagers when he was a 20 year old adult, he was around the same mental age so had no real idea of how wrong it was at the time. He did grow up to deeply troubled by it after extensive therapy that helped him to understand. They should have been in separate facilities but unfortunately safe guarding wasn\u2019t put in place.\n\nI saw them once a few months after I left in the town centre where I lived, they were still together and and still in the same facility.

I think I have seen you in the adoptee sub!", "It may seem like a nice idea but in reality, I don\u2019t have the same rights as everyone else. Adoption is a business. It has nothing to do with saving children. The industry exists to provide children as a commodity to those who want to buy us. It\u2019s a multibillion dollar industry that has ties to genocide.

It is human trafficking parading around as social justice. I personally had my heritage and ethnicity erased from my paperwork so I could be sold as a \u201cwhite\u201d baby for more money. \n\nAlso fwiw, I was adopted before I ended up in state care. Part of the industry is having a place to dump unwanted adoptees when the adoptive parents realize that we aren\u2019t necessarily going to live up to our price tags or marketing. (Some of the schools within the troubled teen industry cost as much as college.) Adoptees made up between 15%-30% of the students at those schools, where we only make up 2% of children.\n\nWe (and former foster youth) are also over represented within the prison system.

Yes many mentally disabled individuals are able to have normal functioning relationships BUT someone who is mentally 5-10 isn\u2019t one of those people. They are mentally a CHILD.

Just because you\u2019re physically old enough doesn\u2019t mean you are mentally capable of understanding what sex is and the potential repercussions from having it. \n\nSO many mentally disabled people are sexually assaulted and aren\u2019t even aware thats what that is because they don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s gross and disgusting and often times abusers will use their physical age as justification.\n\nAgain: if they\u2019re a mentally disabled person able to understand sex, it\u2019s functions, and any potential outcomes then of course they\u2019re capable of having an adult relationship.
