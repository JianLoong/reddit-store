{"id": 31027, "submission_id": "17vyz2y", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Financially Support My Adoptive Family Who Kicked Me Out at 18?", "selftext": "I was adopted into a Christian family when I was just a kid. At the age of 8, my adoptive parents decided to take in a mentally disabled foster child. Since it was a newborn, no one really knew the extent of the disability.  \nGrowing up was kind of tough because of this. Ever since I've been able to make my own decisions, I've disagreed with my \"sister\" and my adoptive parents' beliefs.  \nHere's why: My \"sister\" was always the center of attention, and having beliefs forced on you doesn't feel like true believing. (It's not like we believe in unicorns just because they\u2019re in a My Little Pony commercial, right?)  \nThis all came to a head on my 18th birthday. They kicked me out, saying I was old enough to make it on my own. For the record, I was already pretty independent, earning my own money alongside school, because there wasn\u2019t much support at home. They were too busy with my foster sister.  \nThankfully, I was able to stay with a friend's parents that same day. They helped me get on a healthier path for the next three years until I was ready to move into my own place.  \nNow, I'm 33, a guy, and doing well selling designer jewelry from Europe in China. I also volunteer and support youth programs \u2013 things like student exchanges, tutoring, and advice hotlines.  \nSometimes, the local newspaper mentions my work, even my name. And guess who reads that paper? My adoptive parents.  \nRecently, they've been calling, texting, and showing up at my door.  \nThe reason? They're in a financial bind with all the global issues like inflation and wars. Plus, they're taking care of my now 25-year-old foster sister. She's mentally about 5 to 10 years old, doesn\u2019t really get social norms, and has two kids of her own. My adoptive parents are looking after them too since she can't.  \nAnd now, they want me to cover all their expenses.  \nAITA: So, am I wrong for not wanting to spend my hard-earned money on them after being treated poorly for years?", "created_utc": 1700069943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vyz2y/aita_for_refusing_to_financially_support_my/", "score": 148, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to finance their life. \n\nBut wait, you kinda glossed over how the mentally aged 5, but physically aged 25 girl has two children. Pardon me, what.", "NTA, but if she's that intellectually disabled, you might want to report them to adult protective services. Someone got her pregnant", "You're not obligated to provide for other adult family members unless you want to.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe them anything.\n\nQuestion:  Did I understand correctly that your mentally disabled sister has TWO CHILDREN?", "NTA\nWow those two are way over 18. Can\u2019t they make it on their own too?", "> She's mentally about 5 to 10 years old, doesn\u2019t really get social norms, and **has two kids of her own**.\n\nwhat what WHAT?!", "NTA \n\nThey kicked you out of their house to fend for yourself because you don't follow their religion. They didn't care what happened to you. Now they want you to support them. Let them figure it out on their own, just like you had to. Your not responsible for fixing their lives.", "The guilt is understandable and natural, but you\u2019re not obligated to give them anything - nor *should* you because they very much decided to rip the rug out from under you while you were getting on your feet.  They made a conscious decision to cut you out of their network, and there\u2019s no real reason to give them aid now.  NTA", "NTA - you have zero obligations to these people who gave you the boot the moment they didn\u2019t have to legally take care of you anymore. They made their bed and they can lie in it. \n\nTell them you \u201cprayed on it and god said no\u201d lol", "NTA. Move and change your number.", "NTA. If you were old enough to \"make it on your own\" at 18, your adoptive parents are more than old enough to take care of themselves.\n\nWhen will people stop telling family members \"You're dead to me\" only to ask the corpse for financial assistance when things get tough?", "*She's mentally about 5 to 10 years old....has two kids of her own....*\n\nWTF? So, raped.\n\nNTA. *No one* owes anyone anything.", "NTA but if your evaluation of your adoptive sister's intellectual/mental capabilities are accurate I would strongly suggest you placing a call to Adult Protective Services on her behalf/her children's behalf. You don't need to have any involvement with them past this, but there are only a handful of ways someone who is mentally 5-10 years old gets pregnant and most of those should result in the impregnator going away to prison for a nice long stretch of time", "NTA. They seem to have the mentality that once you hit 18 you are responsible for yourself, and since both of them and your foster sister are over 18 they are responsible for themselves.\n\nAlso, idk how often you hear this, but it seems like you've made a great life for yourself and I'm proud of you! It sounds like you might have transitioned as well? Which, if I read that correctly, doing that on your own is a big deal as well!\n\nRegardless, congrats on taking a challenging start to life and making it your own. I wish you all the best!", "NTA. The parents established that the age of 18 is old enough to make it on your own. They are both over 18. They can take care of themselves and whoever else they choose to help. You also get to choose who you want to help, if anyone. You are choosing not to help them.", "NTA\n\nBut how does she have 2 children when she has the mind of a 5 year old? She has definitely been violated.", "NTA. It's your hard-earned money, you have no obligation to financially support them after being treated poorly.", "NTA.  They can go pound sand.  They threw you out at 18!  You've done well for yourself and now they want to treat you like an ATM.  Had they never found out you are successful you never would have heard from them.  They certainly would not help you if the tables were turned.", "NTA -block them", "NTA why do they feel it\u2019s YOUR responsibility to fund THEIR expenses? Tell them no, \u201cthey are old enough to make it on their own.\u201d", "NTA. They don't give a damn about you; they just want your money. I'd suggest calling adult protective services though if your sister has the mentality of between 5-10 and got pregnant twice.", "NTA. They kicked you out, they chose to sever their relationship with you, you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything for them. It serves you no benefit to entangle yourself with them, and could lead to an utter mess that will leave you with further trauma, as well as resentment.\n\nThe fact their foster daughter, who is mentally 5 to 10 years old, got impregnated not only once, but twice, is incredibly alarming though. These people sound negligent and irresponsible at best.", "NTA, you as the child was chosen to be left behind because their 'values' made them take in a child they clearly can't take care of and further allowed her to have children somehow which is questionable horrible considering she doesn't know social norms even at 25.", "NTA - They are old enough to make it on their own. But I'm kind of concerned that your sister is mentally 5-10yrs old but has 2 children of her own? ..that.. doesn't sound right.", "Your parents are absolutely disgusting that your sister, who has the mentality of a 5 year old, has 2 children. \n\nHow did this happen - not once, but twice?\n\nNot sure that I believe any of this.", "Check out \u201cTorn Apart\u201d by Dorothy Roberts. Something like 80%-90% of foster children are abused. I lived in state care for a while and most of my friends were in foster care. The \u201cschool\u201d was a front for a sex trafficking ring. Disabled kids were even more at risk.\n\nI\u2019m adopted too. I was groped and hit on at family reunions because \u201cyou\u2019re not *really* related.\u201d", "This!", "Seriously!!! If she truly has the mental capacity of a 5-10 year old, she is NOT capable to consent to sex, jfc!!", "I've heard of different situations where mentally disabled people are in an arranged marriage so that the other person can take care of the disabled person. The \"regular\" person usually isn't aware before marriage, though It's usually the other way around: women who are \"imported\" from elsewhere and have quite the shock after the wedding. Makes me so sad for both people.", "This. WTAF. NTA. But parents sure sound like they fit the mold. And that mold is one of a holy buttplug.", "Protective Services needs to step in and protect her. If she is intellectually disabled, she is not capable of consenting and even if she did verbally say yes, it is still rapee.", "This exactly!  \nThey were required to provide for you as a child so they did.\n\nThey did not give you any help afterward, kicking you out at 18.\n\n You owe them nothing that you don\u2019t want to give.", "Yeah, who diddled the poor things holes", "I completely agree!  If they want to play the religion card, then OP should just tell them that he prayed on it, and God said no.", "I'm going to disagree. Despite their differences, people with mental disabilities still become adults and go through puberty. They can want love, sex, relationships just like anyone else. When you say things like this, you are infantilising them. The hard part is making sure they are not being taken advantage of and use safe sexual practises. \n\nSource: used to work with mentally handicapped people. They had relationships with each other.", "Unfortunately it\u2019s not that simple;\nMental capacity is not an automatic \u201ceither or\u201d situation, a person can be judged to lack mental capacity in some areas (such as money management or signing a legal contract) but to have capacity in others, such as relationships and sex.  The bar for the latter is set very, very, low.", "Seriously? I know this is Reddit but try to have SOME tact\u2026"]}
