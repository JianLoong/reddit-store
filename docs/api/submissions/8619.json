I scolded my wife after buying loads of candy, cookies, and soda while our daughter is needing to lose weight.", "selftext": "Backstory, I was an athlete in high school which has carried over into hobbyist wrestling as an adult. I\u2019ve been a weightlifter since I was 14. When my wife and I met, she was \u2018big boned\u2019 if you get my drift. It has never been an issue as that\u2019s what I like. Over the years, she has gone up and down with two pregnancies. Totally understandable, she is overweight right now. I only care about her being healthy. With our history said, we have very different diets. But again, that\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nWe have two daughters, 10 and 15. The youngest is at a normal weight, she tends to be more active and follows my after my diet. The eldest, unfortunately her weight is concerning. Last year, she put on 30lbs over a two month period. She was diagnosed as pre-diabetic in November, with her BMI being nearly triple what it should. The doctor put her on a plan and gave her a weight loss goal.\n\nJust after the new year, we had a pipe burst upstairs in the walls. Our house was deemed uninhabitable, insurance sent us to a hotel as repairs were made. We spent two weeks at that hotel, we had a microwave and a mini fridge. I completely understood it wasn\u2019t easy to eat healthy given the circumstance. However, I got in from work one day to find my wife had purchased numerous soda bottles, a bag full of candy, and two packs of cookies. The three sat on the bed watching a movie while snacking away. \n\nI was disappointed in my wife, who only could say she bought all that for herself. I told her she needed to get rid of it immediately. It\u2019s not even about our child needing to lose weight, but her health is being at risk. No doubt, all that crap spiked her blood sugar. My wife argued she wasn\u2019t going to toss it out, she\u2019d stash it away from the kids instead. \n\nWe\u2019re back home now but it\u2019s still upside down. Our kitchen isn\u2019t functional. Few nights ago my wife brought in McDonald\u2019s for dinner. Personally, that wouldn\u2019t have been my choice, I haven\u2019t eaten that food in 8+ years. But again, because of the circumstance I understood until the eldest sat down with a large fry, large soda, and two cheeseburgers. I felt like she could have gotten healthier options there, instead of what she gave her. This only resulted in an argument that was not going anywhere. \n\nTwo nights ago everything came to a head when I accidentally stumbled upon candy wrappers hidden in the eldest\u2019s bedroom. To be clear, this is not candy from the hotel. When I took it to my wife, she came undone and said that I had given her and the eldest an eating disorder with my constant \u2018bitching\u2019 about what ate. She said now they have to hide it from me, because no one wants to be shamed. She mentioned how I \u2018blew up\u2019 at the hotel over them munching on junk when they had no means to eat healthy. I decided to get the scale out and weight the eldest. She\u2019s gained 8lbs since her November appointment. I think my reason for concern is entirely valid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not perfect like you with a perfect body.\u201d", "created_utc": 1675014975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10odt6z/aita_i_scolded_my_wife_after_buying_loads_of/", "score": 563, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I tried stressing, this isn\u2019t about her appearance but about her health. She says my approach was abusive and gave them an eating disorder now since they have to hide what they eat from me.

You policing her diet will only cause her to hide more and do more behind your back. You are setting her up for a lifetime of issues with food. Instead of attacking her and watching her like a hawk, talk to her calmly and explain why you are concerned. Challenge her to go a week without candy or one soda a week. Ask her to go walking with you or to hit the gym with you. Often times people rely on food to cope with something personal in their life. Maybe she has something she is dealing with that you don\u2019t know about. It took me years to get a hold of my binge eating. I don\u2019t eat unhealthy anymore except for special occasions (rarely), but I still hide my food even if it is healthy like raisins, protein powder and roasted nuts. This is a direct result of having someone digging through my personal things to \u201cdiscover\u201d my food and having someone constantly watching and policing my diet.

But I suggest keeping an open mind when y'alls start with the sessions. Maybe there's something unintentionally adding to the mix. Though I can definitely see just you being able to successfully maintain lean fitness causing a type of spiraling jealousy.

Been smoking since he was 10. I carry extra weight and work to ward off what my body naturally wants to do, dive into a vat of chocolate from a pizza springboard.\n\nThe spouses are grown and right or wrong will do what they want to do. Talking doesn't help.  What helps my son is seeing me cook and eat veggies. Eating with me so he can take queues on what a balanced plate should look like. The health talks will probably go well one on one because she SEES you doing it and is old enough to realize who feels good in their body and has energy and who does not.\n\nEven buying a treadmill or bike and just using it w/o a lecture or fuss may prompt her to try.  I got a used one and just started using it.  Sure enough my kid has been 'caught' working out.\n\nNTA", "I am like you and cut the garbage food out of my life long ago.  If for some reason candy or cookies or anything like that makes it inside our house it goes straight into the garbage.  However my son has been raised that way from birth and my wife is on board with healthy eating as well.  He's only ever eaten a healthy diet and I've always explained to him why we eat the way we do and that everybody else makes their own choices and like any choice there are consequences both good or bad.  So I would not categorize our opinions and behavior around food \"disordered\". \n\nYour wife and daughter are using food like a drug and have been their entire lives.  As you know this is not only easy to do it is nearly impossible to escape because of the way foods are marketed and everything is made confusing and easy to rationalize.  Unlike other drugs, we actually need food to live so you just can't quit using food like you can alcohol, tobacco, etc. Unfortunately the vast majority of people are eating this way and it's the only way they know of and the lifelong pleasure eating has left them strongly addicted to these types of unhealthy foods (that taste the best) as well as vastly over consuming because they are eating to get and stay 'high' not for nutrition.  Because some people are naturally resistant to storing so much fat it makes the rest of us believe we can all eat the same and hold our BMI down.  People really don't want to be told they can't have candy and ice cream and McDonald's anymore.\n\nSo definitely screaming at them will not get you anywhere and makes things worse.  Concentrating on appearance is no good.  The only thing you will accomplish is them hating and resenting you and them feeling inside that they are bad or broken.  The fundamental problem isn't the food choices, which are definitely not good, it's that there is no element of control over this issue whatsoever and that is a big problem.  \n\nThe first thing you would have to do is you and your wife getting on the same page about your own diets.  Somehow she has to start caring about her health make that a priority and translate that to food.  There has to be an education process that leads to some eureka moments like when you calculate you are eating twice as many calories as you need or half as much protein and what will happen if you keep going that way.  There has to be some reasons they care about to begin taking initiative and making changes.  Everything has to be positive!  Positive and not obsessive.  You don't want disordered thinking and behavior around food so even though this is a huge deal, you can't make it a huge deal.  You just have to start trying to turn the ship around and take whatever progress you can get as you get it.  Explore cooking, setting goals, making plans, doing it all together as a team, family walks, family activities.  Supporting each other.  The whole 'I can do this what's wrong with you, you need to do what I'm doing' plan won't go anywhere.  I certainly don't envy your situation and I hope you can begin the process with your wife and everyone can move to a healthier lifestyle.  \n\nIt's a national crisis and you would be doing your daughter the biggest favor of her life to help her with this; I had to do it on my own as an adult and it was the hardest thing ever.  Just be very very careful.  Good luck!", "NTA. The topic of weight and eating disorders is quite sensitive especially for women. I know bc I am a woman and I\u2019ve also had an eating disorder for most of my childhood and adolescence. So with that being said, your approach to this issue is not the best, but I understand that it\u2019s from concern for her health rather than judgement. \n\nOvercoming binging is rather complex and your daughter probably already feels guilt every time she eats these kinds of foods, hence why she hides the wrappers of these foods. Your daughter is also at a very crucial age in her life where insecurities especially of weight and appearances matter tremendously. \n\nI guess my advice would be to be patient and supportive of your daughter. Sit and talk with her, let her know your concerns and offer to help her make small changes to her lifestyle. Also, just an FYI, candy, soda and cookies are made to be addicting, the more you eat them the more you crave them. So don\u2019t be too hard on your wife and your daughter for constantly snacking on these items because it\u2019s a hard addiction to break. Just be supportive and encouraging. Good luck!", "NTA. Your teenage daughter is 300 pounds, turning diabetic, and your wife is sabotaging her health. It's easy to see how your daughter gained so much when a parent is keeping sugary and fatty foods in the house on a daily basis. This should've been addressed before you had to live in a hotel.\n\nPeople will say you are giving her an eating disorder by being so fixated on her diet. That ship had long sailed. Your wife has been overeating for years, before pregnancies, it's not surprising your daughter learned that such habits are normal.\n\nYour wife is in denial. You daughter is learning to hide her habits from you. But the habits are there nonetheless. It's more important to encourage her to lose weight in the immediate future. As her parents, and as she is still a minor, her diet is mostly under your control, and your wife is failing her. She should be on your side, even if she herself has an eating disorder. I, too, would be angry with my spouse for jeoparidizing my child's health.\n\nEdited to add, yes, there is a control issue here. Daughter's eating habits may be the one thing in life she feels in control of. Yet it's the one thing you SHOULD control, as it's a dangerous coping mechanism.", "She sounds like she has binge eating disorder. And if that is the case, weight loss should never be the goal.\n\nI have struggled with Binge Eating Disorder since I was around your daughter's age. Swinging between binging, gaining a lot of weight, freaking out and starving myself to drop as much weight as possible before breaking down and binging again. The cycle is very damaging to mental and physical health, especially a teen girl's. She needs therapy for it to help her find a balance. Telling her she needs to eat healthy and watch her weight will not help, because she is aware of it. I was painfully aware of what I was doing to my body but it's sort of like a drug addict. They know what they are doing to their body is bad for them, but it's not just some switch you can turn on and off.\n\nShe needs help accepting her body and working to eat balanced, consistent meals (put weight loss on the back burner that is not the concern. The concern is speaking nicely to yourself, about yourself, accepting your body how it is and finding the root of why she feels she needs to binge and hide food (notice that is how an alcoholic acts with their booze. They hide it and drink in secret to avoid the shame from others). Mine was anxiety/depression/lack of control). I don't think YTA because I found it's impossible for people to fully understand unless they've been there, but you're entering that territory if you don't address the root of the problem and instead make her feel bad about something she probably can't control.\n\nEating poorly is not morally wrong, but I can tell you for a fact she spirals into shame a guilt every time she does it, which leads to terrible self-talk/body image/anxiety etc.\n\nAlso, don't restrict her diet, because restriction leads to binging. Cutting out foods makes them all you can think about. Instead, help her eat regular, fulfilling meals, and if she wants some sweets, let her eat sweets. Eventually, she'll learn that the junk food isn't going anywhere, and it won't be such a big deal. She'll want it less. Don't put her on a time limit for weight loss.

I\u2019ve been a weightlifter since I was 14. When my wife and I met, she was \u2018big boned\u2019 if you get my drift. It has never been an issue as that\u2019s what I like. Over the years, she has gone up and down with two pregnancies. Totally understandable, she is overweight right now. I only care about her being healthy. With our history said, we have very different diets. But again, that\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nWe have two daughters, 10 and 15. The youngest is at a normal weight, she tends to be more active and follows my after my diet. The eldest, unfortunately her weight is concerning. Last year, she put on 30lbs over a two month period. She was diagnosed as pre-diabetic in November, with her BMI being nearly triple what it should. The doctor put her on a plan and gave her a weight loss goal.\n\nJust after the new year, we had a pipe burst upstairs in the walls. Our house was deemed uninhabitable, insurance sent us to a hotel as repairs were made. We spent two weeks at that hotel, we had a microwave and a mini fridge. I completely understood it wasn\u2019t easy to eat healthy given the circumstance. However, I got in from work one day to find my wife had purchased numerous soda bottles, a bag full of candy, and two packs of cookies. The three sat on the bed watching a movie while snacking away. \n\nI was disappointed in my wife, who only could say she bought all that for herself. I told her she needed to get rid of it immediately. It\u2019s not even about our child needing to lose weight, but her health is being at risk. No doubt, all that crap spiked her blood sugar. My wife argued she wasn\u2019t going to toss it out, she\u2019d stash it away from the kids instead. \n\nWe\u2019re back home now but it\u2019s still upside down. Our kitchen isn\u2019t functional. Few nights ago my wife brought in McDonald\u2019s for dinner. Personally, that wouldn\u2019t have been my choice, I haven\u2019t eaten that food in 8+ years. But again, because of the circumstance I understood until the eldest sat down with a large fry, large soda, and two cheeseburgers. I felt like she could have gotten healthier options there, instead of what she gave her. This only resulted in an argument that was not going anywhere. \n\nTwo nights ago everything came to a head when I accidentally stumbled upon candy wrappers hidden in the eldest\u2019s bedroom. To be clear, this is not candy from the hotel. When I took it to my wife, she came undone and said that I had given her and the eldest an eating disorder with my constant \u2018bitching\u2019 about what ate. She said now they have to hide it from me, because no one wants to be shamed. She mentioned how I \u2018blew up\u2019 at the hotel over them munching on junk when they had no means to eat healthy. I decided to get the scale out and weight the eldest. She\u2019s gained 8lbs since her November appointment. I think my reason for concern is entirely valid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not perfect like you with a perfect body.\u201d\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's totally understandable that you are worried about your daughter's health and are trying to take some kind of action to address the problem. At least you're facing the situation squarely and are willing to take action. \n\nUnfortunately, you're underestimating the severity of the problem and not understanding how difficult it is to come up with an effective plan for someone who is that far over the normal BMI. Sometimes the only thing that works for people who are that heavy is medical intervention like a gastric sleeve, lap band or bypass surgery. Normal dieting and exercise strategies just don't work for some people because they cannot stick with the program long enough to make substantial progress, and regain the weight plus more after they give up.\n\nAlso, your daughter is at the age where she is going to turn this into a power struggle and will thwart all your efforts, just to show she is the one in control. I can tell you this because I was an overweight teenager, started dieting and gradually slid into anorexia as a way of rebelling against my father. He thought I was getting too thin and kept encouraging me to eat, putting food on my plate at the dinner table, baking cookies for me, etc. The more he pushed me to eat, the more determined I was to starve myself. My weight dropped down to 116 lbs., which is really low for someone 5'10\", before I finally realized how bad I was hurting my family and decided to stop the insanity.\n\nAt this point, you need help and guidance from professionals who specialize in eating disorders and understand the parent-child dynamics involved in your family.

Y T A not for wanting your daughter to get healthier, but for using some ineffective and potentially harmful tactics like humiliation (public weigh-ins), being overly rigid, and scolding. These things can cause what seems to be happening - binge-type eating and secretive eating (hiding food out of shame). Your wife is also TA for being overly permissive, in denial about your daughters' emerging health issues, and for engaging your daughter in an \"us vs them\" mentality around food, maybe because she is also ashamed about her own eating habits. You both mean well and love your daughter but we ALL have internalized hangups about food and you want to prevent your daughter from developing her own.  \n\n\nYou are right that your daughter needs to lose weight and more importantly find a healthier way to eat to address pre-diabetes - 300 lbs and pre-diabetic at 15 is very concerning.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing - it sounds like you are healthy and in shape - but that being very rigid about nutrition isn't the best approach for someone needing to lose weight).  \n\n\nI'd recommend working with a registered dietician who has experience working with EDs (reminder that EDs don't always translate to extreme thinness, binge eating disorder is an ED that typically correlates to weight gain) so your daughter improves not only the foods she eats but her RELATIONSHIP with food and exercise.

Then set goals with non-food rewards: at 25 lbs lost we'll get a pedicure, 50 and we'll get new clothes, 75 and we'll  go to a theme park, or whatever she's in to. \n\nYou all can do this but you have to do it together.", "Bad habits formed early stay with you, believe me I know. I was made to clear my plate when not hungry or when I was full. I have overheated all my life. Two weeks ago I had a gastric sleeve (I\u2019m 58).

Once puberty hit me I started gaining weight and my mother who is also big was constantly at me and put me on a diet by the time I was a teen. \n\nI stopped eating too which was awful and I was always super close to passing out. My mother only cared that I was skinny. I'm fat again now cos I started to properly eat again and my physical and mental health have never been better! \n\nI still eat whatever \"junk\" I want but guess what, i also eat lots of fruit and veg, because the better advice than telling someone to stop eating something is \"add don't restrict\" which means adding nutrient dense foods to what your eating to make it more satisfying. Eg adding fruit, nuts and yoghurt to a cookie. And asking urself why you feel like eating whatever it is you're about to eat. Sometimes u just fancy it and that's ok, but sometimes u could be eating out of boredom or emotionally or because it's something u tend to deny urself. Restriction is the fastest way to binging. \n\nI would highly recommend looking into intuitive eating and helping her learn how to listen to what her body needs rather than just forcing her to be miserable", "ESH\n\nI know you\u2019re trying to be helpful and supportive since her health is trending towards having lifelong issues.

I\u2019m still overweight but I get checked out by my dr twice a year and my numbers are pretty good (a plant based diet helped with my A1C taking me out if pre-diabetes).  Make doing exercise fun and inclusive with your daughter.  Don\u2019t expect her to run miles or lift weights, but encourage a family walk or even walk around playing a game like Pok\u00e9mon Go.

Dysfunctional relationships with food and movement\n\n2. You, her doctors, and society in general framing this in terms of weight, albeit for different underlying reasons\n\nYou need a therapist to work with the whole family for the first one. You should be as worried about your wife\u2019s unhealthy eating habits leading to the kids being motherless far too early just about as much as you are worried for your daughter\u2019s health.

The challenge is your relationship to your family\u2019s relationship to food and your understanding of their relationship to food. Until you can do better there, you are likely to do more harm than anything else.\n\nAll of you need to stop using weight as a proxy for health. Medical care providers can be awful about this because it\u2019s a correlated, easy to measure piece of data. But the relationship there is far more complex than they are acknowledging, and she quite possibly can become healthy - by physical capability measures and blood markers - without loosing physical mass. When you compound that with the very real, very nasty connotations that weight loss, weight expectation, and dieting has throughout our culture, I suspect that using weight as a metric is going to do more harm than good.\n\nI\u2019d start by finding a medical team that is better up to speed on the psychological impact of their approach (possibly by searching for eating disorder specialists), getting rid of the scale at home, and finding other data points she can use to identify progress. Things like blood sugar readings, cholesterol levels, etc., sure. But also how long she can comfortably walk - with the goal being in the multiple hours. How easily she can go up and down stairs - with the goal being trivially. How well she can do the other activities in her life that she wants to do.\n\nShift your conversation entirely, with the help of a therapist, to understanding why she deserves to be healthy and how she can find a happy way to do that.", "NTA the Dr has already told her she needs to lose weight.

He\u2019s being too punitive and contributing to the kid\u2019s unhealthy relationship to food but the mom is not an innocent bystander here.", "Where did he say he obsessively dieted? Saying he eats healthy is not dieting or being food obsessed. And it\u2019s not even hard to not to eat McDonald\u2019s. The place is disgusting and over priced. It sounds like the daughter took after the mothers eating habits.", "Basically all fruit and most vegetables are completely fine without a fridge for multiple days up to more than a week. There\u2019s a ton of options without Soda (drink water), candy, cookies and chips.", "Walk through a produce section in a store and tell me how much of it is refrigerated. Yes, they don\u2019t last more than a few days outside of a fridge, but if they\u2019re temporarily in a hotel room, they\u2019re not buying groceries in bulk - they\u2019re buying for a couple days at a time. Not to mention there are plenty of shelf stable, packaged, healthier options. There\u2019s no excuse for buying candy and soda if they\u2019re supposed to actively be trying to avoid it.", "It can limit options, but it doesn\u2019t make you option-less. Most people just use it as an excuse. Canned veggies and meats are also shelf stable and can be microwaved. Tuna packets and whole fruits such as apples, bananas, pears, oranges, etc, do not require refrigeration and last several days. Sandwich fixings, nuts packets, pretzels, low sugar cereals, no-butter popcorn\u2026. All better options that soda, candy, and cookies. There is no reason to buy those items.", "How many fruit and vegetables are in a fridge when you buy them at a supermarket or a greengrocer?\n\nThe answer is like, none. What are you on about?", "If the hotel room didn't have a fridge you can get a camping fridge quite cheaply. We use one all the time to store fruit and salad when staying in cheap hotels.", "Lol your argument in favor of soda is that it's shelf stable?  \nWater is also \"shelf stable\", and access to clean drinking water is practically unlimited in any first world country.\n\nOP is describing his family buying junk food, not having a one off occasion where they forced off their extremely healthy diet.\n\nAnd given that these weight problems apparently existed long before the hotel, that makes it an even sillier argument.", "And she\u2019s only going to gain more unless they go about this the right way. Obviously the mom is not helping but neither is OP. Making her get out the scale and weigh herself in front of the family is not taking the gentle hand, Jesus Christ.", "Perhaps! I wouldn't know about that. Seeing a doctor couldn't hurt. I wonder what other factors are at play. She's already pre diabetic. She needs massive amounts of help and support. To not be tempted by her mother's addiction", "Mom gives the 300 lb daughter cookies and these idiots are blaming him. Fucking unbelievable", "What???? Realistically the one giving the daughter an eating disorder is the mom? Pushing the daughter to binge on candy and junk food? Rewarding good behavior with junk food and ice cream? And shes diabetic! The mom is slowly killing the daughter :(", "U sound fat", "You're thinking about the adult chart. For kids and teens it's different. It takes account their age and growth charts and uses \"body mass index-for-age percentiles\". Looking at the publicly available charts, she has BMI 3 times as high as the average at 15 is (or was when the material was put together). But don't trust me, look it up yourself. I just googled available public sector provided data and skimmed it. But I think that's what OP is talking about.", "Go check her BMI on a teen calculator. Her BMI is 56.7. That puts her in the obese category.  He is correct.", "Nono, in kids it's very different. The percentile they should stay in is within the 5th to 95th percentile. She's at over 99th percentile. While a BMI of 18.5 is barely healthy for an adult, it would put a kid in the 35th percentile which is perfectly healthy for a kid. Kids have completely different anatomies than adults, just compare a kid's veins/arteries to ones of an adult. \n\nI put her measurements into a BMI calculator for kids and it gave me this:\n\n\u2757 Please check the accuracy of the information you entered. If the values are correct, the following shows the calculated BMI.\n\nBased on the height and weight entered, the BMI is 56.7, placing the BMI-for-age at greater than the 99th percentile for 15 year-old girls. This falls in the Obesity BMI category. Having excess weight can increase a child or teen\u2019s risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or other chronic conditions. BMI is a screening measure and is not intended to diagnose disease or illness.", "Yeah, this dude is TOXIC. Like there is no mystery whatsoever why the kid has problems. He doesn\u2019t want a healthy kid, he wants a stick thin kid because he doesn\u2019t value anything else about her.", "Being pre-diabetic being a symptom of her mother encouraging bad eating habits? You'd be correct.", "My mom constantly made, \"You're pretty, but...\" comments to me growing up. But one of the comments she made that I remember to this day (15+ years later) was us, standing in a busy clothing store and her looking at me and saying, \"If you don't lose weight, you'll never be able to keep a man.\" I was a freshman on high school at the time. I'm still working through the trauma that all her comments caused.", "I agree with you and wife probably sees herself in her daughter which makes it a struggle too. It\u2019s one of those parenting issues that you don\u2019t realize will be a big deal until you see how differently you and your SO would approach it. They\u2019d probably do well to all agree to eat better in support of their daughter, but mom would have to stick to that agreement for it to work.", "Food addiction is that elephant in the room that is never going to be discussed.  Processed is legal, virtually unregulated, obtainable everywhere, and a massive moneymaker.  Addicted people feed the industry through buying food, dieting stuff, gym memberships, doctors fees, medications, therapy and possibly surgery.  There is no reason for the government to want people to be less food addicted since we don't have social medicine.", "That\u2019s actually called Orthorexia nervosa\u2026 so\u2026", "There are no bad foods. There are only sometimes foods. Teaching a child anything else is very unhealthy. Kids at a birthday party, has a cupcake. Not the end of the world. \n\nAnd limiting foods and eliminating foods are different things. OP being proud of himself for not eating McDonald\u2019s for 8 years is very telling on his view of food. He thinks he is superior to people who eat McDonald\u2019s\u2026 this man is unhealthy.", "He does bodybuilding. Are you familiar with a bodybuilders diet at all? \n\nIf you were you would know it\u2019s unhealthy and food obsessed. \n\nHis children and wife HIDE FOOD from him because he shames them for eating. \n\nIt\u2019s LIKE a parent who forbids sugar. \nI know addiction. This is a very textbook dynamic.", "Omg. \n\nHis daughter has triple the bmi she should. And he didn\u2019t care until a doctor said something. How does that make it okay that his daughter was festering in addiction for years?? \n\nHow did that happen to a 15 year old girl? Science says it\u2019s trauma. And it came from somewhere!!", "He should have cared about it years ago. They should have been seeking help years ago. He is the AH just for that.", "Knowing a lot of families with eating issues doesn\u2019t educate you on how it happens. It comes from trauma and in this family\u2019s case. OP is that trauma.", "When you say \u201cnow the mom\u2026\u201d you\u2019re missing the.. for the past 15 years this has been going on. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cnow the mom did this.\u201d People don\u2019t HIDE food because they are in a loving and understanding environment. This has been building for years.", "I\u2019ve worked in a produce section in college/high school.\n\nStaff is constantly throwing away produce. I cannot stress this enough, constant culling. \n\nFruits and roots tend to be fine if the shelf, berries and greens tend to get refrigerated. Fruits are high sugar and in many ways are just candy. Greens will  usually go bad quickly. \n\nA lot if that can sit out, but you definitely extend its life by refrigerating. \n\nAnd nobody is taking a bite out of a raw onion.", "Legit, just eat some hearty sandwiches, veggies and dips, microwaveable porridge packets etc for a few days. It\u2019s really easy. Even packets of ramen with some spinach, pre-cooked chicken and an egg thrown in is a decent meal in a pinch.", "You can buy pre cut fruit and veggie containers, made up salads, sandwiches etc. Not ideal but absolutely able to. Also as you mentioned shelf stable fruits etc. \n\nI should disclose im certainly not perfect with my diet and this is in no way meant to shame. Just thought it was worth noting.", "It's a scale.  A piece of medical equipment.\n\nThe child is morbidly obese.  If she gains anymore weigh A standard scale will no long be able to weigh her.", "Agreed.", "Eh, that\u2019s technically correct, but as a pediatrician I would still say his statement is a bit of an exaggeration. If a 15 year old has completed puberty, then they\u2019re closer to the adult BMI chart than the pediatric. \n\nShe\u2019s still clinically severely obese, I just wouldn\u2019t say that a BMI less than 18.5 is healthy, regardless of percentile, with very rare exceptions (while the opposite can absolutely be true, because the difference in weight of muscle and fat is not accounted for - a mildly athletic person could have a BMI of 28 and have very low body fat due to muscle weight affecting the BMI. But lower weights below BMI 18.5 suggest low muscle AND low body fat, which is malnutrition.)", "THIS!", "Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little irresponsible to offer a diagnostic opinion based on a short Reddit post?", "I'm not anywhere near underweight or malnourished. I'm a 40 year old woman who's 5'5\" and 135 lbs. I eat well, I'm just more particular about what I eat. I'll still order a burger if I go out to eat with a friend, but I can control what I bring into my home. If that's an eating disorder then wtf lol", "Well they only just started the hiding food thing because of the recent behavior which I already acknowledged wasn\u2019t the right way to handle it but maybe I\u2019m wrong and you\u2019re right but in that case my question would be: \n\nWhat WOULD be your solution then?? If they don\u2019t want to listen to medical professionals?", "You know, if you have questions, ask them to OP. Otherwise, you're making a lot of stupid assumptions that hold no value and do not merit entertainment.", "As if you have never been blindsided by a problem that was staying you in the face.", "Not doubting your point that it comes from trauma, but how is OP the source of the trauma here?\n\nIn the recent situation with the fighting and the shaming with public weighing, sure, I totally see that.\n\nBut the daughter has been putting on that weight for a long time, and this seems to be OP's first reaction to it. Are we saying the negligence of him not saying anything is the trauma? And, in that case, should we not be equally laying that on the mother?", "That's not the point; you totally missed it. You were using his example to justify that he's the AH, and I'm telling you the issue isn't exclusive to people like him. People get fat in fat family's. People get fat in stressful family's. People get fat in family's with bad parenting. There's more to the picture than a \"parent causing trauma\". It's just the easiest, laziest answer. I can not understand how you can't see the culpability of the mother. \n\nThe issue isn't just him, and you can't possibly conclude that from the information. The mom is giving large amounts of unhealthy food to an over 300lb, 5'1\" individual. His reactions may not be correct, but he's trying to have his family adhere to the doctors health plan, and the mother is literally sabotaging that.", "I am not diagnosing. I am saying the behavior described in the comment fits the exact definition of that diagnosis. For all I know that commenter doesn\u2019t do any of those things. I\u2019ve never met them. \n\nBut that is the eating disorder which they described.", "Yeah. Eating disorders are related to weight. But they are based on behavior. Your weight is irrelevant in any potential eating disorder diagnosis.\n\nFYI. I\u2019m not diagnosing you. I am saying what you described fits the definition. \n\nYou might want to look up Tess holiday tho. She is diagnosed anorexia nervosa. I think she is 450lbs\u2026", "I know it happens. It hasn\u2019t happened to me but it does happen. Doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still responsible for that problem.", "It\u2019s definitely been going on for a long time. \nThe red flags to me were that he compared what his wife fed his kids to his own eating habits in a way to make himself superior. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten McDonald\u2019s in 8+ years.\u201d \n\nThe fact that his wife was so ashamed of her eating she was hiding food from OP. That\u2019s huge! Definitely means fear of OPs judgement. Didn\u2019t just happen. \n\nAnd then the weighing of a 15 year old girl\u2026 \n\nHe\u2019s got a lot of work to do on himself before he can help his daughter.", "I\u2019m saying the trauma is from him because it\u2019s literally my job to identify those triggers. \n\nIt\u2019s like a doctor trying to convince people that vaccines didn\u2019t cause autism. This is my literal career. \n\nAmericans really need more access to psychology \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If that makes you sleep better, you can make the comparison between autism and vaccines. But that's not what this is\n\nThis isn't a clinical setting and they're not your patients. Step off your high horse and realize you are jumping to conclusions in an irresponsible way. How about they listen to their doctors health plan and seek a counselor to develop a parenting plan, instead of listening to an online counselor with limited information? \n\nThere could very well be way more to the story, because from the info, it's clearly not only the husband. You don't know how he acted when she was 200lbs last year, or if she's been obese for a while, his reactions then. He could very well be at his wits end with his wife."]}
