I'm so sorry you're dealing with it. When she's calm and you feel ready, just lay it out more gently to her and tell her what youre experiencing when youre dealing with pain. The blurry vision, the inability to breathe, etc. Some people think they understand what a level 10 pain is until you explain its affect on your whole body. \n\nFinally, if youre not already doing it, I highly recommend learning about mindfulness for pain management.

I've had a lot of surgeries as an adult and fully believe you should get an excuse for most things you say when you're in extreme pain. You're right that she should be focusing more on you, though I understand how comforting it is to lean on your faith when you're dealing with a loved one in pain. She should have been paying attention enough to have realized you were trying to move and known that movement=pain. However, I also think you need to understand that your mom is also under stress given your diagnosis and surgery, so she needs to be allowed to practice her faith if that brings her comfort. I'd suggest having a discussion with her and explaining how you feel without disparaging her religion. I've learned that it's much harder sometimes to be the one watching a loved having surgery and being in pain than going through surgery yourself. I'm not a parent but I'd imagine that makes it even worse to see your kid in pain.i know it hurt me more to see my dad in pain after his cancer surgery than it did when I was the one in pain after they removed my Gallbladder and Appendix.

No where near what you're going through!\n\nStill, I entered that hospital with him at 5 am on a Friday and did not leave again for days.

You have to be able to manage it yourself because (and I\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart) your mother is too self-absorbed to be reliable. Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital published a paper on their *phenomenal* pain management after the Nuss procedure (putting bars in and popping out a concave sternum.) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30078486/. Most of it requires interventions before and during surgery, but there are still things you can ask about if you want to be really pro-active. But this isn\u2019t your job. It\u2019s the doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 job (CCRN, here) to be proactive. So ask her what is your pain plan. If you find you are in too much pain, you need to have it adequately managed before you go home. I\u2019m sure the hospital, an oncology unit no less, has a pain management doctor. Nag TF out of them if you must. Wait til your mom isn\u2019t there and tell the nurse about her. We deal with crappy relatives all the time. \n\nTake care and feel better soon.", "NTA, she shouldn't be in there bothering you. She should be helping you. Fat lot of good her religion is if she just aita around ignoring her child while they're in pain.", "I cannot stand her using religion as an excuse for ignoring her kid thats clearly in need of support/care.

Catholic is Christianity, I just didn't explicitly said that she's Catholic because I forgot that you separate them more in the english language. \n\nI also know that listening to the rosary sounds kind of weird, but there's a polish radio which prays the rosary every night and multiple people listen to that while praying along. I just expressed that I prefer it if she's not praying along out loud while in the hospital because I prefer a quiet environment. She's fine with just listening to it and praying along in her head, but at home she always speaks the prayer and then also doesn't use headphones.", "im 20 if you\u2019re anywhere near me i\u2019d gladly act as your advocate", "That makes more sense.  Do you have a call button for the nurse?", "Exactly. Christian literally means \"follower of Christ\". There are many many many Christians religions, Catholicism is one of them. \n\nI remember going to Catholic mass every Sunday as a kid and they always sang that song \"And They'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love. Yes they'll know we are Christians by our love\"\n\nYou wouldn't know op's mom is a Christian by her love....", "Catholics are stricter then Christians", "i couldn't reach it yesterday but I have one now that I can use.", "Catholicism is a form of Christianity, just like Methodists, Baptists, or Anglicans.", "Since this is a religious thing, what about the clergy from her church?
