She should have been paying attention enough to have realized you were trying to move and known that movement=pain. However, I also think you need to understand that your mom is also under stress given your diagnosis and surgery, so she needs to be allowed to practice her faith if that brings her comfort. I'd suggest having a discussion with her and explaining how you feel without disparaging her religion. I've learned that it's much harder sometimes to be the one watching a loved having surgery and being in pain than going through surgery yourself.

It\u2019s the doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 job (CCRN, here) to be proactive. So ask her what is your pain plan. If you find you are in too much pain, you need to have it adequately managed before you go home. I\u2019m sure the hospital, an oncology unit no less, has a pain management doctor.

I'm so sorry your mom put herself before your very serious needs. I also hope that nurse got you appropriate pain meds quickly.", "It\u2019s not what you say but how you say it. I\u2019m always astonished at children who use profanity at their parents. It\u2019s distasteful. YTA for that.", "I've had my daughter in the hospital, near death, for days. Sat isolated, no phone. No TV, no music, no book. I just laid in bed with her, 6 months pregnant, and tried not to cry. Full attention on nothing but her. \n\nNTA", "This. The nurse will be delighted to get her out of there. Source: am nurse.", "completely agree. my son was four at the time and had spinal surgery, but my entire focus was on my son the entire time he was in the hospital. he was the one that had surgery, he was the one in pain. it's my job as a mother to help and focus on my child.", "Firstly get well soon sending love and hugs xox you are nta I\u2019m a 46 year old woman and a mum my self but if I\u2019m in hospital or in pain my mum is there no matter what I have issues with the dentist and my mum comes in with me to settle my nerves, I understand a little why your mum was upset but for me as others have said her sole focus should be on you. Take care and get well xox", "I have three girls, including a sixteen year old, and my heart just aches for you as I read this. I hope that having a few inter mamas telling you that your feelings are 100% valid and that we\u2019re pulling for you helps! And I would also encourage following the advice of the nurse above and asking for them to have your mother go somewhere else when she wants to pray. Your healing *has* to be 100% the priority right now.

Maybe take a book to read, but something you don't mind putting down to help.", "NTA You could tell your nurses you are uncomfortable with your mother as sole caretaker since she clearly ignored you in favor of finishing the rosary when you were in pain. Her stating she did so to 'calm her nerves' while you were in distress makes it worse. Make sure you've told your hospital team you don't trust your mother to be attentive or act in your best interest during your recovery. And make sure you have the 'call nurse' button near by at all times. Best wishes on a speedy recovery!", "You were in pain so it's alright but still you might have hurt her feeling. Try talking to her and explain about how you feel. Maybe you might be able to make her understand.", "NTA. Speak to a nurse and ask for a child advocate to be appointed to you. Say you were left laying there in severe pain while she ignored you, thather religious beliefs are interfering with your health care, and that you no longer feel safe with her there as a responsible adult. Hospital has to take your request seriously, and it will give your mother one he11 of a wake up call (I hope).", "NTA - your mom was incredibly inconsiderate to treat you like that. You don't need a reason for saying what you did, being in that amount of pain and knowing there is someone next to you who is ignoring you to \"calm their nerves\" is probably exactly what I would have done. She knows you need assistance to do things most people take advantage of normally, and instead of paying attention, she decided to do something selfish. Her rosary can wait while she helps you. She's not going to get smote down for not doing it at exactly the same time as usual.", "Oh sweetie, my heart goes out to you, you are absolutely NTA here, your mother neglected you to listen to \u2018words\u2019 that meant more to her than they should have in this situation, I\u2019m a mum and my son was in hospital when he was 12 with meningitis, he was so sick and either myself or my husband stayed with him the whole time, which ended up being me staying the whole time when I saw my husband lie down in the lazyboy chair and start to nod off, I told him off, said that this time is for looking after our son Jack, not for resting yourself, he apologised and agreed, both us had taken time out from our business to be there with Jack, and Jack really wanted us there, it was quite frightening being that sick, as it will be for you, big hugs honey, you are so articulate and smart, you will get through this, and yes you need your mama, let\u2019s hope she rethinks her stance, unfortunately religion can make some people think it\u2019s more important than anything else and causes them to go all hardline about life in general. Ask the nurses for any help you need with your mum, they will want to help, wishing you all the very best as you recover you gorgeous brave girl xx", "As a daughter when my mother was in the hospital for chemo my full attention would also be on her.

I know the my doctor didn't let me mom into the room with me starting from age 12 unless I explicitly said yes.", "Interesting. My mom was asked to leave my ICU room for causing a problem (dad too) but I was an adult. I was told it was a good thing I wasn't a kid and had my own insurance or they couldn't have made them go. (I was given a devastating diagnosis and my parents came to ICU just after I'd been extubated and said I needed to stop all this, it was all in my head and I just needed to stop all the medicines and get a good workout plan and a good psychiatrist. They were very wrong. I have a number of rare diseases that are proven by tests and also cancer. Last I checked everyone else understands following dr orders). Hope OP gets a nurse like you.", "There\u2019s lots of social workers at the hospital. Maybe pass a note to a nurse to get one and see if they can help.

Well, she *should* have been helping you out of bed. And you can tell her from me that Jesus had a thing or two to say about people who put \"saying prayers\" above \"helping the sick\", and they weren't complimentary.", "Are they able to visit you?", "Loosely I guess. They do acknowledge crucifixion and resurrection so... You're right", "*Anyone* that causes my patient distress can and will be removed if needed. \n\nYes OOP is a minor and that technically gives her parents the right to treat her like garbage if they want to. \n\nBut the technicalities is out the window the moment her physician decides that the parents actions are harming the patient.\n\nThe aftermath is different from country to country.\n\n In my country that's basically it. If a physician chooses to push that button everyone knows that they did it for a *very* good reason. We already have laws that states that any religious, cultural, political etc ideologi is nul and void regarding the care of a person under the age of 18. \n\nSo parents that's JV has no say in wether their kids gets a needed blood transfusions or not, racist parents can't demand that their child's caretakers are white, vegan parents can't stop their children from getting skin grafts mad of pigskin  etc. \n\nIn OOPs case I as a nurse can't remove the mother by force, but I *can* use all kinds of verbal manipulation be it shame, peternalism, bargaining, flattery and about anything else but down right lying or making threats.\n\nSomething as simple as saying in a flat, stern voice \"You have to leave *now*\" and then completely ignoring the person while focusing on the patient can work wonders.", "From my personal experience with both myself and my own children yes. My mom was nagging me because of similar reasons as OP and I was trying not to cry and my heart rate was going up so was my blood pressure which was the last thing they needed because I didn't need to go back to ICU they had her leave and would consult with her outside of my room. With my child I was in hysterics and it was upsetting my daughter and they had me leave the room until I calmed down.", "There's also a couple fair rides that tend to cause pain to those with previous rib damage. If you ever do carnival/fair rides you may want to look into what may hurt. I've got chronic back pain so I really empathize with what you're going through, it sounds scary and painful. I hope you have a fast and full recovery \ud83d\udc9b", "Maybe talk with the nurses about getting her out of your room as much as they possibly can.
