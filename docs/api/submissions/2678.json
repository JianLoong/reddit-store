She should have been paying attention enough to have realized you were trying to move and known that movement=pain. However, I also think you need to understand that your mom is also under stress given your diagnosis and surgery, so she needs to be allowed to practice her faith if that brings her comfort. I'd suggest having a discussion with her and explaining how you feel without disparaging her religion. I've learned that it's much harder sometimes to be the one watching a loved having surgery and being in pain than going through surgery yourself. I'm not a parent but I'd imagine that makes it even worse to see your kid in pain.i know it hurt me more to see my dad in pain after his cancer surgery than it did when I was the one in pain after they removed my Gallbladder and Appendix.

It\u2019s the doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 job (CCRN, here) to be proactive. So ask her what is your pain plan. If you find you are in too much pain, you need to have it adequately managed before you go home. I\u2019m sure the hospital, an oncology unit no less, has a pain management doctor.
