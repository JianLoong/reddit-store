I know when I get into situations where I don\u2019t feel welcome or I feel out of place I\u2019ll just get on my phone and tune people out until they get my attention because I don\u2019t want to be a burden on the normal dynamic. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re working out outside as he\u2019s rolling up that\u2019s pretty intimidating for a 19 year old (even if they think they\u2019re full on adults). Maybe he thought the best course of action was to simply not speak unless spoken to in these situations. \n\nSo far I\u2019m on the fence. Generally I agree with you that he should at least acknowledge you when entering your home but he could just be REALLY nervous.

Obviously not the greatest sin in the world and I didn't want to embarrass him, or my daughter. I did tell her later to always offer to rest the gentleman's hat when bringing him back into our home because I wanted to keep enjoying seeing him. Sigh. I don't want walls and barriers between me and my kids and I have found myself working *over time* so that they know we are always on the same side. OK?\n\nManners matter. Again not the end of the world when a young person isn't already familiar with our expectations. But, acknowledging another person's humanity and existence with speech is pretty basic etiquette, after all. It is common courtesy. And I would have told my daughter later, \"Please train your friends to be civilized honey. I really don't want to see John again if he can't be bothered to so much as say 'Hi!'' to me when he comes over. I don't want to embarrass him or you so that's why I waited to bring it up. Hopefully the more he knows you, he'll get used to us having different traditions from the ones he's familiar with. Thanks for listening.\"\n\nYou were in the right. But, you were too abrupt.  NTA.

He's probably scared shitless to go over the house . The relationship is new, and that can be scary by itself.  \n\nWhen I was a teen , that stuff terrified me, and I was very quiet, too. I hated it because I felt so awkward.

The kid is pretty rude to not even acknowledge you, and you didn\u2019t need to be so rude and confrontational about it.\n\nAn alternative would\u2019ve been to talk to your step daughter in private about how her bf should at least acknowledge your presence and say hello, and let her have that conversation with him.

Kid is rude, but you're an adult and a parent. Start acting like one, rather than picking fights with 19yo teenager.", "I wouldn't say ahole, but it definitely could have been handled better. There's nothing wrong with addressing the kids rudeness, but imo you should have stayed for an actual conversation rather than walking away. What you did invites no conversation, demands to be listened to, all without opening an actual dialogue. Maybe the kid has a reason, maybe he doesn't, but here you are still not knowing and unable to fix the actual problem in a way that respects everyone. I say apologize for your abruptness and try again. After all, you can't teach something you don't practice.", "I don\u2019t have a whole lot of respect for an adult man whose self worth is so threatened by a 19 year old failing to say hi while coming up the driveway. You seem really hung up on respect and escalated a situation that didn\u2019t need it and acted like a fool. The kid should have better manners (he could be nervous, he could be unaware of good manners and will learn as he grows up) but you are the one who ultimately came across as the rude one and your wife and stepdaughter probably think less of you. I would.", "Are you a minority group in terms of perceived worth? LGBQTIA, obese, different race, low socio-economic, disabled ?   As a kid and young adult I had  people shun / ignore for the  sin  of being 'other '.  EDIT Lol, why all the downvotes?  Don't think for a second just because I mentioned discrimination that I approve of if, or think it acceptable!  It's a reason, not an excuse.\n\nI can tell you right know as a member of a number of minority groups (lucky me) that there are people in this world that will happily throw you in a gaol or worse just for simply being different.  Being ignored can seem like bliss when you have people actively trying to hurt you just for having the temerity to exist.\n\nI was shunned, treated like an untouchable, had my intelligence and hygiene denigrated, had opportunities in move ahead in life taken off the table once I got to the stage where people saw me.  I am now at the stage in my life where they can't hurt me anymore.  So when I asked if he was a member of a minority group, it sure as hell wasn't because I think rudeness was justified.  It's just I have been there, denied common courtesy such as even a greeting or acknowledgment, just for being \"what\" I was.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t a dad and daughter thing.
