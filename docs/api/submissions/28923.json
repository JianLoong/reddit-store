On a previous visit he has spoken to him, asked him questions and been completely ignored, then after being completely ignored again he started directly that it's common curtesy to say hi. \n\nIf someone is refusing to interact with you at all and it's your home you have ever right to tell them to be polite or gtfo.", "Every downvote is likely from a socially awkward, terminally online loser. It really is sad how weak and pathetic society has become.", "A married man rating women's breasts and genitals and talking about licking them and nipping them is both sad and disrespectful to your partner and the women you're perving on.\n\nHell yes I'm judging you.  Better rude than a sleazy old dude.", "oh wait, there they go", "To be fair, at that age people tend to expect elders to initiate conversations. Many are taught to only respond to an elder, not speak unless spoken to sort of thing.", "Oh, I understand it. I just don\u2019t let it limit me or reduce me. And I experience it, present tense. I\u2019m in treatment, I\u2019m not cured. \n\nI\u2019m not going to assume or say anything about your perception and experience of mental illness, because it\u2019s yours and it\u2019s different from mine. It feels rude personally to do otherwise. Be well.", "you're asking the guest to be polite in a very passive aggressive and impolite way tho, which is rude, maybe more than what her bf was doing", "And now you're psychic? Bye.", "Right. I noticed you don't have much of an interactive history. Very odd. I'm going out on a limb here, and I'm guessing you still live at home, introvert, no real interaction or experience with women. Speaks volumes to your arrogance. Thinking you are superior to everyone else. Good luck with that.", "That's called being an adult and I'm proud of you, I personally know how tough it is but it is absolutely doable. She uses it as an excuse so she doesn't have to do things. Everyone has problems. It's not the world's responsibility to deal with your problems it's yours. I wouldn't bother trying to argue with it, she has to make the choice herself. Anyways good job and keep going strong.", "I'm solely talking about before I even knew there was something wrong with me. I know I'm not supposed to say 'wrong' cause I'm just 'different, not wrong', but before I understood my illness I just wasn't what would be considered correct in my actions. I'm better now, not what most would consider normal but much closer to it because I'm able to see my own actions more clearly and how they are perceived. I have no idea if this kid falls into the category I'm talking about, but OP seemed harsh and inconsiderate, as if only his own feelings mattered without taking into account why these situations may have occurred. All I'm saying is that the bf might not be an asshole, there could be a decent explanation for their actions and OP was ignorant in assuming they knew what was going on", "No im literate\u2026", "But the whole thing is that this person is not an adult, as far as I can tell. Yes, us as people who are older and have lived experience with mental illness recognize our wrongs and are better now, this person is still figuring things out.", "Okay first off dude is 19 when I was 19 I didn't even know I had problems just thought I was weird AF  compared to others and sometimes I'd go hours and hours without a single word just because I had nothing to say, but if a situation like this happened I'd do the proper thing and greet them then go back to my silence. I will say again it's your responsibility to deal with your problems, no one else's Second I was talking about you, sure went off about people not understanding yet you misunderstood my message almost entirely. And thirdly your still using it as an excuse, I don't even understand how that doesn't embarrass you. It just truly baffles me how you could look at someone and say sorry I can't help it I'm \"insert excuse\" and not feel like absolute shit about yourself. Basically telling the world I'm too weak to deal with my problems so you have to do it for me. It's one thing to ask for help it's another thing to whine like a baby so others will handle it all. God it makes me embarrassed that I get grouped together with you just because they mixed it all into a spectrum. I'm sorry I went a little wild and ranty but I also feel extremely strongly about this especially since it just keeps becoming more and more socially acceptable."]}
