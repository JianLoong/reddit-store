Prior to the party I am hosting a private dinner for 40 of my close friends and family. I am paying for both the party and the dinner.\n\nI sent the invitations a few weeks ago and one of my closet childhood friends asked why his wife wasn't invited to the private dinner. I explained that the dinner was for close friends and family only. They've been married for 2.5 years. I was in the wedding and I've interacted with her plenty since then but my stance is, that her being his wife doesn't make her my close friend. We are cordial and friendly but there are people more important to me that I want to celebrate with at the dinner. What he doesn't know is that I am giving gifts to everyone at the dinner. Nothing major, just something that's special and unique to the relationship I have with that person. i.e. for the friend mentioned I'm gifting him with a vinyl copy of Vol 2 Hard Knock Life since that is album is basically how we became friends. \n\nHis wife and one of her homegirls I became cool with is invited to the party afterwards but he thinks its rude to not invite her to the dinner. He offered to pay for his wifes meal but I explained to him its not about the money. This is my chance to gather my people in a room and thank them for the role they've played in my life. He thinks his wife should be in that number. I don't.\n\nRSVP's are due next week and I sent reminder texts to him and a few other people. His response was \"Is my wife still not invited to the dinner\". At this point I am ready to disinvite him from the dinner but not sure if that would make me an a$$hole.\n\n He is not the only married friend/family member whose s/o I didn't invite to the dinner but he was the only one who complained.\n\nAm I the a$$hole?", "created_utc": 1685041966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rqh1z/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friends_wife_to_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously you are, it's your party and your money.\n\nIs it surprising a friend might judge you the AH for this? No it really isn't! Are you really a grown adult yet unaware that for parties of this nature, it's considered normal for married couples to both be invited?\n\nI mean you absolutely can do whatever the heck you like.\n\nBut it's a bit rich to imply he's the AH for thinking this is rude as heck.\n\nYTA", "YTA You were in their wedding. You have become friends with her. Maybe you don\u2019t realize: that\u2019s his Ride or Die. This is one of those moments where inviting her to maintain the friendship is important.", "YTA. Tactless as all hell. Are you single? You sound like you're so inexperienced that you can't grasp - at 40 years old - how rude this is.", "Everything about this screams extreme narcissism. Youre throwing your own big birthday party, with a super special portion of it that cuts off the loved ones of the people you claim to be so close to and love yourself. You want your own little ecosystem of people to celebrate yourself, and justify excluding their partners because they havent been around you forever. How the fuck would him having his wife beside him at the dinner devalue you addressing your \"people\"?\n\nYTA. Its time to grow up, youre not that special and if you were someone else would be throwing it. Ffs...", "YTA- you put your good friend in an impossible position, regardless on whether or not other people partners were ok with not being invited. This guy wants to do right by his wife and his friend, evidenced by offering to pay for her to come too. At this point I don't think it matters if you uninvite him, cause it sounds like he ain't goin anyway.", "YTA.  I'm trying really really hard to envision how my SO would attend a dinner while I --  do what???  Sit at a separate table across the room alone and eat dinner so I can have the honor of attending an after party?  And WTH is a 40 y/o's after party?  Y'all gonna play games or have a cotillion or what?  Cocktails are before dinner, ya know, so I'm not sure what you are doing to start with.   But I will tell you this, seriously,  my SO and I don't socialize separately.   He does guy things with guys and I do gal things with gals but in mixed company we are a couple.", "You've created a colossal problem for a lot of people.  Why would you separate people from their spouses--especially if you know them both?  You're not 25, bruh.  People's wives matter to them, and some people, shockingly, like hanging out with their wives/husbands.  \n\nThe problem with your \"explanation\" (to keep your secret) is that it makes you look even more weird.  Why not just find a way to announce it while you're at the party?  Surely someone with some social grace could have helped you with that.\n\nSomething like:\n\n> *\"And, now, I wanted to give something back to some very special people in my life.  I have a few things for those people!  I don't have a gift for everyone, sadly--but, hey...***STEAK***!\"*  And then raise your glass.  IDK.  Something.\n\nStill, that's kinda shitty at a party.\n\nWhy can't you do your gifts in some private session after?\n\nI mean, yeah, this is kind of an asshole move.  Look at the position he's in now.", "Are you willing to lose your friendship with your close friend by uninviting him because he wanted his wife to be included?", "I mean....it is your party and you can invite whoever you want...\n\nBut I do think it's a bit of a dick move to invite one half of a married couple but not the other.", "Can't tell for sure. I don't think that people like their loved ones not being included. He chose his wife and they might act as one person. On the other hand you said you invited her to the party afterwards so I don't see where the problem is.", "I'm a bit split but coming down on the side of YTA the more I think about it.\n\nThis one is a bit more than the average meal with your mates situation.  There's a meal followed by an after party.  Already a parallel to a wedding.\n\nSo by default, anyone with an SO is going to get treated to a meal (and a secret gift) whilst their partners are just going to have to make do and take care of themselves on their own.  Doesn't really get them in the party mode unless they have a \"party of OP's SOs\" thing going on... which just makes it look more like an isolated downgrade for those that didn't make the cut.\n\nWith a close friend as well, whose wedding you were involved with, the message (even if you didn't mean it) is \"Sorry, your wife just isn't good enough for my table.\"  Deep cut for a close friend.\n\nThat's before even considering if anyone has to travel for this event.\n\nAt the same time, I do get that this is something you're paying out of pocket for and have to consider costs, so that mitigates the assholery a bit.  But it does look bad even if you are ultimately planning to do nice things for specific people.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to invite who you want, and he has the right to decline.", "NTA, if the same thing goes for other people then tell him that. Especially if you\u2019re giving gifts to everyone, it would be obvious if she didn\u2019t get a gift/got a relatively anonymous gift.", "I wouldn\u2019t go either, if I were your friend. You\u2019re making things unnecessarily difficult. YTA", "NTA and this norm is fucking stupid", "NTA, but don\u2019t disinvite him. Just repeat that his wife is invited to the party but not the much smaller dinner, and that you hope he can make it to the dinner because you have something special to give him there. Let him know that other people are invited without their s/o\u2019s and this isn\u2019t personally about his wife. If he decides not to come, that\u2019s on him.", "YTA. That is not a socially normal thing to do. It\u2019s one thing not to invite someone\u2019s partner if they just got into a relationship. I kind of get that. But these people are MARRIED and its odd that you think 2.5 years isn\u2019t long enough to warrant here inclusion. I mean it\u2019s your party so do what you want but don\u2019t be surprised when your friend doesn\u2019t attend because you excluded his wife.", "Nah, you did nothing wrong by not inviting her, he hid nothing wrong for calling you out on it. But I think once you explained the situation he should have tried to understand.  \n\nYou being in their wedding does not give her a automatic invite to the dinner, but it does to the party which is why she was invited. \n\nSome married couples don't have lives outside of their marriage and that might be what your friend is going through, especially right now, they probably still in the honeymoon phase.\n\nStand your ground, it's your party and money. If your friend pushes the issue just tell him you will see him at the party then. It's unfortunate cause it seems like a cool dinner you planned.", "YTA. You're inviting \"40 close friends\" but you can't include his wife who you know very well?", "I think a dinner for close friends and an after party for a bigger group sounds fun and not like a weird asshole power move. I want to say n-a-h because I understand why someone feels a way about their spouse not being included in things but dang he\u2019ll be seeing her like four hours later. NTA", "So this actually is challenging. Like if I invited my buds to go camping or gaming before my party, that's perfectly A OK, and would be weird if someone wanted their wife to come along.\n\nIf I apply that logic to dinner, it's weaker (god knows why, we don't know the social programming in our heads) but it should still fly. It's a closed event, like if you're members of a club.\n\nIt still puts your friend in a difficult situation, but I guess this is where you test how good of a friendship you have.\n\nNAH", "NTA his wife isn\u2019t excluded as she\u2019s invited to the party. It\u2019s a friends night out dinner and you are inviting your friends.", "NTA its your party and you are paying for it", "NTA. You explained your stance. As you've mentioned, she's not the only SO that wasn't invited to the private dinner, just the only one who complained. It's not tactless or rude at all, it's the special way *you* want to celebrate *your* birthday and I think it's a sweet idea, to celebrate all the people who've had a significant impact on your life.\n\nThat being said, don't uninvite him. Stand your ground and let him RSVP no if he's going to continue to make it awkward. Maybe you can pull him aside if they show up to the party and give him the present. \"I wanted to give this to you last night, I'm sorry you couldn't make it.\"", "YTA but barely. \n\nYour idea is fine but you managed to not express it. Also - 40 ppl is a lot. \n\nis there a space limit? If that is why you needed to limit you should mention that. \n\neither way whatever you do, if your friend decides to skip the dinner - don't lose a friend over this. \n\nyou could tell him there is a personalized gift etc and why you thought it was meaningful and wanted to share that memory with him etc.", "NTA - He's taking \"the two make one\" a little too seriously.  It's your party, you should be able to invite or not invite whoever you want.", "NTA It sounds like the friend is refusing to understand the premise of the dinner.  Friend or wife has no manners and want to beg an invite for her.  She can put on her big girl panties and fend for herself for a couple hours and he can believe in her ability to safely do that or she can stay at home.", "NTA, she is not excluded from the whole thing and will be at the party. They should be grand spending a few hours apart and it\u2019s your party. That said, if your friend decides he won\u2019t attend dinner without his wife that\u2019s his decision and you will need to respect that.", "YTA, you just can't do that.", "NTA! \nI understand your friend being upset, but at the same time couples need to also understand that they are their own person aside from their partner. He\u2019s your friend, and this is your birthday you are allowed to have who you considered your close group. Just because she\u2019s his wife doesn\u2019t automatically mean she\u2019s a close friend to his friends. You\u2019ve explained to him why, I would ask him one more time. If he still ask the same question, just invite them to the party and no dinner.", "YTA", "YTA. If it were specifically a guys-only event then fine but, otherwise you invite wives.

Join reddit, know one day, 11 years later, that you should be wronged in a party situation just so you could come here and call the OP an AH.  Now that'd be impressive foresight... or you installed a flux capacitor to a Delorean and reached 88mph... hmm... theories abound!\n\nEven better, the person's next response starts with \"Well, I think it's tacky....\" It's almost too much irony for my little brain to handle :-D", "Well, I think it's tacky to demand an invitation to a private event and hold the host emotionally hostage by hanging your friendship over their head. But I guess that's just me.\n\nI'd be perfectly fine with my SO attending without me and would use to time to pick my outfit for the party I was invited to because I'm a grown ass woman and am perfectly capable of functioning on my own for an evening while he celebrates his friendship that I only recently became a part of. I would understand that I had no place in a private event of this nature because while weddings are for both sides of the couple, a birthday is for one person. And this person isn't my person, it's my SO's person.", "I voted AH just because of the impossible situation OP put his friend in.", "I think he's trying to be cute - like 40th birthday, 40 guests.", "b/c its my 40th and I want to spend the dinner portion with 40 people who I am closet with. If I invite her 40 people become 41... then I have to field questions from other people whose s/o weren't invited... so then 41 becomes 46/47.

He likes when he is implicated in some way, like when one dude kept telling me how sorry he felt for my husband. \"I'll send him your condolences.\" \n\nI lurked long, far, and wide. My women's intuition told me to expect this slight from OP. Never should have had him in our wedding! hahaha.", "How is OPs friend holding him emotionally hostage and hanging his friendship over OPs head when OP is the one who said \u201cI\u2019m thinking about just uninviting him now\u201d, which is the actual friendship ender?", "I'm totally fine if my husband wants to attend something like that alone. I just know that, in general, he'd prefer I were there. \n\n> I only recently became a part of\n\nWhere did you get that? That may be your situation, but OP clearly is close enough to have participated in the wedding, and now his best friend is upset. Best friend isn't an asshole for being upset that his wife has been excluded.\n\nI still don't understand how 40 people is a private event either - that's more people than I had at my wedding.", "Yep, I saw your main comment and agree with you on that.", "So you\u2019re so stuck on the number 40 you\u2019re willing to risk a friendship over it. By the way it sounds like your 40 count is already blown as right now you are at 39\u2026.. did you find someone to replace your ex friend so you can keep you 40?", "You don\u2019t respect it though, if you\u2019re considering uninviting him because he asked if his wife could be invited which will actually affect your friendship in a way that inviting his wife and throwing your arbitrary party planning numbers off won\u2019t. You know that right?", "Holy sh*t it\u2019s all about numbers\u2026100% YTa", "You have 40 close friends yet have never navigates this social situation or seen anyone else do it?", "If anyone else declines, you still don\u2019t have 40", ">I explained that the dinner was for close friends and family only. They've been married for 2.5 years.\n\n2.5 years compared to 30+ years of friendship is recent. This is not my situation. This is OP's situation. Again, weddings are for both sides of the couple; you don't have to be close to the bride to be a groomsman in someone's wedding. Birthdays, however, are for one person. And you should probably be close to the *one person* who's having the birthday. This is a private event because OP has personally selected 40 people (possibly because OP is turning 40?) that made an impact on his life. His friend's wife did not make an impact on his life. I don't know why people can't wrap their heads around this.\n\nAnd yes, my SO would *want* me to be there, but would also understand and respect his friend's wishes because, again, grown ass adults.", "Yeah, most people don\u2019t have 40 close friends. With this guy\u2019s attitude, I can\u2019t imagine he does either.", "I guess you missed the part where I said friends and family. But duly noted... appreciate your input", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll be majority family."]}
