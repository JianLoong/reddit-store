Prior to the party I am hosting a private dinner for 40 of my close friends and family. I am paying for both the party and the dinner.\n\nI sent the invitations a few weeks ago and one of my closet childhood friends asked why his wife wasn't invited to the private dinner. I explained that the dinner was for close friends and family only. They've been married for 2.5 years. I was in the wedding and I've interacted with her plenty since then but my stance is, that her being his wife doesn't make her my close friend. We are cordial and friendly but there are people more important to me that I want to celebrate with at the dinner. What he doesn't know is that I am giving gifts to everyone at the dinner. Nothing major, just something that's special and unique to the relationship I have with that person. i.e. for the friend mentioned I'm gifting him with a vinyl copy of Vol 2 Hard Knock Life since that is album is basically how we became friends. \n\nHis wife and one of her homegirls I became cool with is invited to the party afterwards but he thinks its rude to not invite her to the dinner. He offered to pay for his wifes meal but I explained to him its not about the money. This is my chance to gather my people in a room and thank them for the role they've played in my life. He thinks his wife should be in that number. I don't.\n\nRSVP's are due next week and I sent reminder texts to him and a few other people. His response was \"Is my wife still not invited to the dinner\". At this point I am ready to disinvite him from the dinner but not sure if that would make me an a$$hole.\n\n He is not the only married friend/family member whose s/o I didn't invite to the dinner but he was the only one who complained.\n\nAm I the a$$hole?", "created_utc": 1685041966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rqh1z/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friends_wife_to_my/", "score": 1548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Youre throwing your own big birthday party, with a super special portion of it that cuts off the loved ones of the people you claim to be so close to and love yourself. You want your own little ecosystem of people to celebrate yourself, and justify excluding their partners because they havent been around you forever. How the fuck would him having his wife beside him at the dinner devalue you addressing your \"people\"?\n\nYTA.

I'm trying really really hard to envision how my SO would attend a dinner while I --  do what???  Sit at a separate table across the room alone and eat dinner so I can have the honor of attending an after party?  And WTH is a 40 y/o's after party?  Y'all gonna play games or have a cotillion or what?  Cocktails are before dinner, ya know, so I'm not sure what you are doing to start with.   But I will tell you this, seriously,  my SO and I don't socialize separately.   He does guy things with guys and I do gal things with gals but in mixed company we are a couple.", "You've created a colossal problem for a lot of people.  Why would you separate people from their spouses--especially if you know them both?  You're not 25, bruh.  People's wives matter to them, and some people, shockingly, like hanging out with their wives/husbands.  \n\nThe problem with your \"explanation\" (to keep your secret) is that it makes you look even more weird.  Why not just find a way to announce it while you're at the party?  Surely someone with some social grace could have helped you with that.\n\nSomething like:\n\n> *\"And, now, I wanted to give something back to some very special people in my life.  I have a few things for those people!  I don't have a gift for everyone, sadly--but, hey...***STEAK***!\"*  And then raise your glass.  IDK.

I don't think that people like their loved ones not being included. He chose his wife and they might act as one person. On the other hand you said you invited her to the party afterwards so I don't see where the problem is.", "I'm a bit split but coming down on the side of YTA the more I think about it.\n\nThis one is a bit more than the average meal with your mates situation.  There's a meal followed by an after party.  Already a parallel to a wedding.\n\nSo by default, anyone with an SO is going to get treated to a meal (and a secret gift) whilst their partners are just going to have to make do and take care of themselves on their own.  Doesn't really get them in the party mode unless they have a \"party of OP's SOs\" thing going on... which just makes it look more like an isolated downgrade for those that didn't make the cut.\n\nWith a close friend as well, whose wedding you were involved with, the message (even if you didn't mean it) is \"Sorry, your wife just isn't good enough for my table.\"  Deep cut for a close friend.\n\nThat's before even considering if anyone has to travel for this event.\n\nAt the same time, I do get that this is something you're paying out of pocket for and have to consider costs, so that mitigates the assholery a bit.  But it does look bad even if you are ultimately planning to do nice things for specific people.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to invite who you want, and he has the right to decline.", "NTA, if the same thing goes for other people then tell him that.

You\u2019re making things unnecessarily difficult. YTA", "NTA and this norm is fucking stupid", "NTA, but don\u2019t disinvite him. Just repeat that his wife is invited to the party but not the much smaller dinner, and that you hope he can make it to the dinner because you have something special to give him there. Let him know that other people are invited without their s/o\u2019s and this isn\u2019t personally about his wife. If he decides not to come, that\u2019s on him.", "YTA. That is not a socially normal thing to do. It\u2019s one thing not to invite someone\u2019s partner if they just got into a relationship. I kind of get that. But these people are MARRIED and its odd that you think 2.5 years isn\u2019t long enough to warrant here inclusion. I mean it\u2019s your party so do what you want but don\u2019t be surprised when your friend doesn\u2019t attend because you excluded his wife.", "Nah, you did nothing wrong by not inviting her, he hid nothing wrong for calling you out on it. But I think once you explained the situation he should have tried to understand.  \n\nYou being in their wedding does not give her a automatic invite to the dinner, but it does to the party which is why she was invited. \n\nSome married couples don't have lives outside of their marriage and that might be what your friend is going through, especially right now, they probably still in the honeymoon phase.\n\nStand your ground, it's your party and money. If your friend pushes the issue just tell him you will see him at the party then. It's unfortunate cause it seems like a cool dinner you planned.", "YTA. You're inviting \"40 close friends\" but you can't include his wife who you know very well?", "I think a dinner for close friends and an after party for a bigger group sounds fun and not like a weird asshole power move. I want to say n-a-h because I understand why someone feels a way about their spouse not being included in things but dang he\u2019ll be seeing her like four hours later. NTA", "So this actually is challenging. Like if I invited my buds to go camping or gaming before my party, that's perfectly A OK, and would be weird if someone wanted their wife to come along.\n\nIf I apply that logic to dinner, it's weaker (god knows why, we don't know the social programming in our heads) but it should still fly. It's a closed event, like if you're members of a club.\n\nIt still puts your friend in a difficult situation, but I guess this is where you test how good of a friendship you have.\n\nNAH", "NTA his wife isn\u2019t excluded as she\u2019s invited to the party.

Stand your ground and let him RSVP no if he's going to continue to make it awkward.

They've been married for 2.5 years.\n\n2.5 years compared to 30+ years of friendship is recent. This is not my situation. This is OP's situation. Again, weddings are for both sides of the couple; you don't have to be close to the bride to be a groomsman in someone's wedding. Birthdays, however, are for one person. And you should probably be close to the *one person* who's having the birthday. This is a private event because OP has personally selected 40 people (possibly because OP is turning 40?) that made an impact on his life. His friend's wife did not make an impact on his life. I don't know why people can't wrap their heads around this.\n\nAnd yes, my SO would *want* me to be there, but would also understand and respect his friend's wishes because, again, grown ass adults.", "Yeah, most people don\u2019t have 40 close friends.

His friends wife has become his casual friend but should their relationship fail he'd never speak to her again, so she's invited to the party, but not to the intimate friendship dinner.

It feels more like you're having 2 parties- one with people, and a better one for your *favourite* people. It's definitely worse if 40 people make up even half of the party goers numbers.

I wouldn\u2019t be bothered at all if he was the only one invited to a friend\u2019s dinner (if I\u2019m not that close to that friend), but my husband would probably not want to go, he would absolutely feel weird leaving me out, knowing that the friend is my friend-ish too and that I\u2019m invited to the after party. The logistics are bad, he ates dinner in the party and I eat at home? He would have to leave, come back home to pick me up and then go to the afterparty? Would I grab a cab/uber and we would arrive separately? My husband is the type of guy that if he eats with his friends somewhere good, he would absolutely bring something for me too, even if it\u2019s just Mcdonalds, so I know he would feel bad leaving me behind. Honestly, I would just rather not go at all and leave him to go to the party (knowing that he would probably not go to the afterparty because he would not be comfortable without me) and he would end up trying staying home with me because he would feel weird. In the end, we would go just to the after party together, or he would go to the party and then come back home and I would be fine with either option.", "Yeah, but it's still a bit weird that he invited her to the \"after-party\" then.

Like why does it matter that hiking involves going home and 'resetting', as opposed to going from dinner to a party.\n\nBut it does, because it does feel weird, but I doubt there's any _real_ reason or logic behind it. It just feels weird, like eating breakfast food for dinner.", "I think OP was actually *in* his friends wedding.", "Yes you're right, I suppose it shouldn't matter really (except for the logistics part), but it does. It's quite interesting to think about the quirks of our minds!", "She didn\u2019t say anything according to the post. The husband is the one who rightfully said it was rude. \n\nAs a wife, myself, I can\u2019t imagine going to this weird, \u201cintimate\u201d friend dinner would be even mildly interesting so I\u2019d beg him to go alone anyway. But it\u2019s the etiquette of it. Who does that?", "I think about it a lot, its my special interest for years.  How do these rules form, why do they not have granular structure?", "That's BS. Spouses are TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE. They are not attached at the hip. They do not have the exact same relationship with every person in their lives. They are allowed to attend events individually.", "No. I strongly dislike those couples who suddenly seem to become 1 person after starting a relationship, unable to have a (social) life of their own. \nThe spouse is not the close friend, why should she be at the close friend/family dinner. Especially because it was clearly communicated beforehand.", "The unit that is your family is for many a strange concept here. I've had many discussions in the past and will probably still have them in the future.  \nAnd yes offcourse you do stuff seperately. But big parties (like this dinner party) are not them.\n\nIncredibly rude of OP. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHe is the AH.", "? \n\nYeah.... my wife and I are the same. I'm talking about situations where someone sends an invitation for an event. \n\nAs I said, we both usually attend things like this alone anyway. But, for example, on *her* 40th I didn't invite people with the assumption that they would come alone. I invited about ten people and 30 attended, which I expected because of people bringing spouses and/or children.", "Nah they're both tactless... Its rude OP didn't invite the wife, it's also rude the friend is making it a big deal....", "He can invite whoever he wants, yes.  But that doesn\u2019t make him exempt from the consequences of those decisions, like alienating one of his closest friends and it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not an asshole."]}
