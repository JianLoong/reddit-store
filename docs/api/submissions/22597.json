My mom divorced my father due to this and we have cut connection with him due to this. He and the woman stayed together for a few years and then he left her and his daughter and started yet another family with another woman. I don\u2019t know all the details but he sends child support money to the woman he had a daughter with and left. \n\nShe got addicted to drugs a few years after that and last I heard she has not been taking care of the daughter. That fell on the grandma of the half sister. \n\nRecently I get calls from a number and I ignore it because I don\u2019t know anyone from the area code. Then I just picked up randomly and it\u2019s the grandma of the half sister . She tells me she wants me to take my half  sister temporarily while she does through chemo for osteosarcoma. I questioned her as to how long this arrangement will last and she said a month or 2. She assured me it would only be temporary but I kept questioning her as to why the girl doesn\u2019t just stay with her and maybe even help with cleaning and cooking. She\u2019s 13 by now so mostly self sufficient. The grandma kept telling me she\u2019s already called to her brother, my father, her daughter and no one will help. I told her I\u2019d think about it and hung up. \n\nI (reluctantly) called my father and he told me the diagnose for the grandma is not great and chances are whoever gets his daughter will be forced to take care of her indefinitely if the grandma passes. I made it clear it was his kid so he should be taking the kid but he said he paid his child support and he never wanted a child \u201cit was just an accident\u201d. We had a yelling match and I\u2019m pretty disgusted by him but he clearly only paid child support and wants nothing more to do with her.\n\nI called the grandma and told her I can\u2019t help and her only real recourse is to sue my dad into helping or getting her daughter to and she cried and told me she doesn\u2019t have time for that and my step sister will probably go to CPS as the hospital and school already know she\u2019s sick and her granddaughter is basically unsupervised. She\u2019s apparently dealing with her issues by doing drugs, drinking and running away to night with her bf and the grandma is worried she might get pregnant. \n\nTo be clear I don\u2019t want to help, I don\u2019t think I have a direct obligation to. My father and her mom made her they have to step up. But her mom is on drugs and my father made it clear he isn\u2019t participating.

But that doesn't mean you, your wife, and your kid needs this in your life right now.  The 13 year old is already drinking, doing drugs, and running around.  Your dad  needs to step up.

Bringing a 13 year old with drug issues, drinking, behavior problems, who likes to stay out all night with a BF into your home would be a nightmare.

She would probably be better off with CPS.", "NTA, but half-sister right, not step sister?", "Definitely NTA. I feel for the girl a lot because she is innocent in this situation of a drug-addicted mom and father who has completely rejected her from the beginning. Now she\u2019s likely to lose her only real home with her grandma. It\u2019s an awful situation but it\u2019s one you have had no part in. None of this was caused by you and this would change your life in a major way. Taking in a troubled teen you really don\u2019t even know while you have a five year old isn\u2019t only stressful but could be potentially dangerous if these issues have her turning to drugs like her mom. Your child should not be around that, your home would immediately become significantly less stable. Can you imagine if your child found drugs she has or if she did something to put them at risk while high? It\u2019s sad but ultimately you don\u2019t know this girl and can\u2019t trust the situation to be safe.", "NTA. Accident my ass.

Your wife is already against the idea. \n\nFocus on your 5 year old and tell your dad to act like a man.", "NTA- At the end of the day, she is not your responsibility.

Yes she was dealt a horrible life. But you can\u2019t risk your child and marriage to save her.\n\nYour wife has told you this is a horrible idea. Do you think she will stick around while this 13 year old disrupts your life? I don\u2019t. And she will take the five\nYear old with her.", "NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys.

I feel for all of you, you the child and her grandmother. This really sucks", "Nta at all, right; BUT let\u2019s say your 5y o was suddenly displaced by similar circumstances because you and your wife got sick\u2026 would you want someone decent to step up?", "I am so confused and stopped reading. WHAT STEPSISTER?   \nYou mean your dad's stepdaughter or your father's child, meaning your half sister???", "Yea this is a tough spot and I feel for you man. If you don\u2019t want to help that\u2019s kinda the end of it as unfortunate as it is for your step sister, hopefully she ends up in a decent foster facility but that\u2019s pretty doubtful. You could be the one to finally give her a really stable home but if she\u2019s already on a bad path it would be a lot for you and your wife to take on so it\u2019s more than understandable not to especially if you don\u2019t truly view her as family.

They were despised by all, and the butt of all jokes. They were innocent kids, but punished because of the actions of their parents. Calling someone a bastard is still used as an insult, today. \n\nA kid without an involved father is more likely to do drugs, do poorly in school, and commit crime. Having a family come together as a village to support that child can make a world of difference. \n\nYour sister didn\u2019t get that. She got a drug addict mother, a father who openly wishes she\u2019d never been born, half siblings who resent her existence, and the only one who took her jn, her grandmother, is dying from an excruciatingly painful form of cancer. It will feel like her bones are breaking. The pain will get so bad she will feel terror. \n\nThat\u2019s what your sister, related to you by blood, is up against. None of you will help her because your father and her mother are assholes. She\u2019s going to ruin her own life because no one cares, and she knows she\u2019ll be alone and unwanted. \n\nLook, I understand your anger and pain at your selfish father and his mistress. Yes it\u2019s true his child should be his responsibility. Perhaps a court will make him take his unwanted child. What a great life for the kid. \n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything at all to you, and she must be scared. She\u2019s your blood. I don\u2019t think your blood should go to foster care to possibly be assaulted or abused. I wish your family would come together. \n\nI knew someone who was the product of his mother cheating. His mother was white, and her husband black. He came out a redhead, glaringly pale among all his brothers. His father cheated, perhaps in retaliation. Though their parents did not remain together, the cousins, siblings, and half siblings are all tight. It\u2019s like all the beautiful colors of humanity at their family events. My friend was the youngest, and his brothers were linebacker huge. When he got bullied in the neighborhood for what his mother did, there was a line of his brothers standing right beside him. Eventually, my friend grew linebacker huge, too. \n\nIt was beautiful, how his relations just accepted each other. They were blood. They belonged. No one tossed him out for what his mother did. They protected him. \n\nWish that happened more often. Perhaps less kids would go down the wrong path.", "You have to do whatever works for you but you're NTA either way.

It will probably take therapy and more to help this your girl.\n\nWill this destroy your marriage?  **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**.\n\nYou have  a life with a child and a living partner.

Is there no way for you to help in any other way? \n\nI can\u2019t even pretend to know how CPS works and how much you can help her find a good foster family, etc etc. But providing a point of family connection would probably make her feel less like trash from her dad and his families and the rest of the world. \n\nThis child is going to lose the one person in the world that loved her and I would not be surprised if she ended up being the final person to throw herself away as well", "Nta.
