My mom divorced my father due to this and we have cut connection with him due to this. He and the woman stayed together for a few years and then he left her and his daughter and started yet another family with another woman. I don\u2019t know all the details but he sends child support money to the woman he had a daughter with and left. \n\nShe got addicted to drugs a few years after that and last I heard she has not been taking care of the daughter. That fell on the grandma of the half sister. \n\nRecently I get calls from a number and I ignore it because I don\u2019t know anyone from the area code. Then I just picked up randomly and it\u2019s the grandma of the half sister . She tells me she wants me to take my half  sister temporarily while she does through chemo for osteosarcoma. I questioned her as to how long this arrangement will last and she said a month or 2. She assured me it would only be temporary but I kept questioning her as to why the girl doesn\u2019t just stay with her and maybe even help with cleaning and cooking. She\u2019s 13 by now so mostly self sufficient. The grandma kept telling me she\u2019s already called to her brother, my father, her daughter and no one will help. I told her I\u2019d think about it and hung up. \n\nI (reluctantly) called my father and he told me the diagnose for the grandma is not great and chances are whoever gets his daughter will be forced to take care of her indefinitely if the grandma passes. I made it clear it was his kid so he should be taking the kid but he said he paid his child support and he never wanted a child \u201cit was just an accident\u201d. We had a yelling match and I\u2019m pretty disgusted by him but he clearly only paid child support and wants nothing more to do with her.\n\nI called the grandma and told her I can\u2019t help and her only real recourse is to sue my dad into helping or getting her daughter to and she cried and told me she doesn\u2019t have time for that and my step sister will probably go to CPS as the hospital and school already know she\u2019s sick and her granddaughter is basically unsupervised. She\u2019s apparently dealing with her issues by doing drugs, drinking and running away to night with her bf and the grandma is worried she might get pregnant. \n\nTo be clear I don\u2019t want to help, I don\u2019t think I have a direct obligation to. My father and her mom made her they have to step up. But her mom is on drugs and my father made it clear he isn\u2019t participating. My wife and mom both made it clear it would be a terrible idea for me to get involved and we have a 5 year old so it will disrupt our lives as well.

But that doesn't mean you, your wife, and your kid needs this in your life right now.  The 13 year old is already drinking, doing drugs, and running around.  Your dad  needs to step up.  The best you can do is  help with legal costs to sue your dad for child support.  CPS might be her best chance.", "NTA\n\nI feel terrible for this young lady, but this is not your responsibility. Bringing a 13 year old with drug issues, drinking, behavior problems, who likes to stay out all night with a BF into your home would be a nightmare. It's awful that she got this lot in life, but with her mother's drug addiction, it's little surprise. Bringing her into your home will only make a nightmare situation for your daughter. \n\nYour grandmother needs to be putting pressure on your father. It's HIS daughter.", "You have a 5yr old - do you really want to bring a troubled stranger with substance abuse issues in for an indefinite stay? \n\nNTA. I get feeling guilty but under no circumstances do you take her in.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also block them from your numbers. Go no contact.", "God, NTA.\n\nIf you wanted to help a kid and take them into your home, you would have adopted.\nNot your responsibility. She would probably be better off with CPS.", "NTA, but half-sister right, not step sister?", "Definitely NTA. I feel for the girl a lot because she is innocent in this situation of a drug-addicted mom and father who has completely rejected her from the beginning. Now she\u2019s likely to lose her only real home with her grandma. It\u2019s an awful situation but it\u2019s one you have had no part in. None of this was caused by you and this would change your life in a major way. Taking in a troubled teen you really don\u2019t even know while you have a five year old isn\u2019t only stressful but could be potentially dangerous if these issues have her turning to drugs like her mom. Your child should not be around that, your home would immediately become significantly less stable. Can you imagine if your child found drugs she has or if she did something to put them at risk while high? It\u2019s sad but ultimately you don\u2019t know this girl and can\u2019t trust the situation to be safe.", "NTA. Accident my ass. Your father needs to step up for his daughter. \n\nYou have legitimate reasons for not taking her in. Your wife is already against the idea. \n\nFocus on your 5 year old and tell your dad to act like a man.", "NTA- At the end of the day, she is not your responsibility. It\u2019s also not a good idea to bring a 13 year-old with behavioral problems around your 5 year-old. I\u2019m sorry your father is such a deadbeat and he has put you in such a terrible situation.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is an idiot.", "NTA. Not your circus. Bringing an alcoholic, drug addict into your family with a 5 year old is a very bad idea. \n\nGma is in a bad situation, but this is not your responsibility.", "NTA do you want your five year old to be expose to this child? Yes she was dealt a horrible life. But you can\u2019t risk your child and marriage to save her.\n\nYour wife has told you this is a horrible idea. Do you think she will stick around while this 13 year old disrupts your life? I don\u2019t. And she will take the five\nYear old with her.", "NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys. This is your father\u2019s problem to solve.", "NTA.  You have zero obligation to anyone here and I would block grandma's number.", "NTA, but she's not your step sister, she's your half sister.", "**NTA**   Not for declining to take her, nor for feeling bad that she needs help.\n\nIf you are active in a church, ask your pastor for guidance.   They may know someone in your congregation who would be a good fit to foster the child.", "NTA She's better off with CPS.", "NTA.. this poor child is not your responsibility. I feel for all of you, you the child and her grandmother. This really sucks", "Nta at all, right; BUT let\u2019s say your 5y o was suddenly displaced by similar circumstances because you and your wife got sick\u2026 would you want someone decent to step up?", "I am so confused and stopped reading. WHAT STEPSISTER?   \nYou mean your dad's stepdaughter or your father's child, meaning your half sister???", "Yea this is a tough spot and I feel for you man. If you don\u2019t want to help that\u2019s kinda the end of it as unfortunate as it is for your step sister, hopefully she ends up in a decent foster facility but that\u2019s pretty doubtful. You could be the one to finally give her a really stable home but if she\u2019s already on a bad path it would be a lot for you and your wife to take on so it\u2019s more than understandable not to especially if you don\u2019t truly view her as family.

A step sister would be if your mom remarried a man who has a child that has no blood relation to you. (Just correcting the term so it\u2019s less confusing, it\u2019s still not your obligation to deal with)", "NTA. Based on comments you can\u2019t even take her. You work too much to be able to care for her and it would fall on your wife who has said no. If you took her, you\u2019d have to potentially separate from your wife and then she still would not have someone to care for her because you\u2019d still be working, she\u2019d be as unsupervised as she is with her grandma. I very much feel for this girl, but you are quite literally unable to take her in.", "Your dad is trash.", "NTA but your dad sure is...", "It's pretty weird that you bounce between step sister and half sister.  She's your father's daughter, so she is your half sister.  She's related by blood and not marriage.  \n\nNTA.  The poor girl needs people who want to help her.  You don't want to.  Unlikely she'll find it in the system given her past and behavior, but it's a bigger chance than someone who doesn't want to from the start.", "That poor girl", "NTA but that poor child and her grandmother.

Genuinely one of the only stories on here where op is actually a good person.  Heartbreaking but ultimately you need to take care of your own, and fuck your deadbeat 'father'.", "You don't have to take her on but blocking is a bit cruel.", "Yeah, 'cause church folk definitely don't abuse vulnerable children. (Great suggestion /s)", "These would be two very unfortunate yet VERY different situations. Imo comparing them is beyond unfair.\n\nThat \"someone decent\" you're referring to for OP's half sister SHOULD be the CPS. And LOTS of professional help. The other commenter is absolutely right.\n\nAlso there's no way to know for sure if OP were to \"step up\" would be what's best for the half sister or OP's family.

You can meet her without having her live with you. The poor girl is facing do much abandonment and loss she would love to feel like someone in her family cares.", "For the other reason alone is enough to not take her in, you can\u2019t expect your wife to take this on when she is unwilling.  Your wife would likely leave and take your 5 year old away.  Then your half sister will be back in the same position.\n\nchild protection will have to step in and hopefully she will get the help she needs.\n\nIt\u2019s a very sad story, and there are lots of sad similar stories but you really are not in a position to take her.\n\nNTA,", "NTA. If your wife is not in favour then your hands are tied. You can't expect her to take on a parenting role for a minor she doesn't want.", "Oh then ABSOLUTELY not.", "Yeah that was confusing.
