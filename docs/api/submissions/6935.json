You\u2019re arguing a point I never made, and I already conceded that gaslighting isn\u2019t a trait of narcissism. \n\nAs someone raised by \u201cnarcissists\u201d who will never ever be diagnosed. It was a very important step in understanding them to know they could be narcissists. It\u2019s never a formal diagnosis, but an informal one can be useful.", "You are absolutely doing a drive by diagnosis. There is absolutely nothing in this post suggesting narcissistic personality disorder. Not one single thing. And yet you put it forward as a theory, because you think abusive behaviour is indicative of narcissistic personality disorder. There is no reason to believe that is likely, except a complete misunderstanding of the disorder that suggests it is inherently abusive and abusers are inherently narcissistic. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to have NPD and not be even slightly abusive, or to be the victim of abuse, and it\u2019s entirely possible to be an awful awful abuser and not have NPD, yet pop culture psychologists have you thinking there\u2019s significant overlap to suggest it as a possibility the minute you see some gaslighting.", "Again, I\u2019m not doing a diagnosis I\u2019m just stating it\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019s a fucking reddit comment I\u2019m not literally saying their parent is a narcissist. I\u2019m saying they could be based on patterns of behavior that are common with narcs.", "You\u2019re saying she could be based on nothing. And you literally said that it was \u201cclassic [narcissist] behaviour\u201d, very clearly stating you think she has narcissistic personality disorder. There is no pattern of behaviour here that is indicative of NPD. There is nothing here that should even raise alarm bells of NPD. There\u2019s nothing here that should have even brought the thought to your head, except the completely inaccurate pop culture psychology that puts abuser and narcissist as synonyms."]}
