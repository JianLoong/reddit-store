Your family needs to realize that it isn't keeping him alive either by thinking this way, They need to see a family grief counselor. You are not an asshole , your family is....", "The wedding vows literally say \u201cuntil death do you part.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s not cheating under any definition.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI am not sure why anyone told them as it isn't their business but yeah, they are being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\n\nBut she should take your parents threat serious, lawyer up and restrict their contact with the kids. There's no good in grandparents that would feed the kids their fantasies about how her mother is cheating.", "NTA. She married him until death do us part and unfortunately he is gone. Like you said, she is young and your parents should not want her to live her life sad and alone. Your a good person to help her move forward. She will always love your brother but deserves happiness, as so does her children", "NTA. Their vows were (presumably) til DEATH do us part. She broke no vows. Guarantee they'd be helping their son move on if the roles were reversed. In fact, they'd see it as their sons moral duty to give their grandchildren another mother.\n\nThey're scared because 1) this is another milestone in acknowledging their son's loss, 2) another man will be taking over their son's role, 3) their role in the future family unit will likely shrink, especially if they decide to move away. Diminishing contact with their only living link to their son probably petrifies them", "NTA\n\nYou are not helping Maddy to cheat. She is a widow. She does not have a husband. You are helping her to move on with life. Help her as much as you can to create a new family for her children. Encourage her to get as far away from your parents as she can.", "NTA - Sorry, but yes, he is deceased. No, she should not be bound by something she said in the depths of grief. And you are right, you can't cheat on the dead. Stand by her and keep supporting her. After the loss of a spouse, eventually continuing forward with life in all respects is not only OK, it is a right that is earned just by being on earth. Falling in love and/or remarrying does not equal disloyalty or \"cheating\" -- and that while you can, should and will always love your late spouse, the heart expands infinitely to welcome new love and a new life if you choose it.", "NTA. Maybe they would have liked it if she threw herself on his funeral pyre instead? What they are demanding is cruel. Good for you for standing up for her.", "NTA. Maddy has been alone for two years. She\u2019s entitled to move on. It\u2019s healthy. The rest of your family are being ridiculous and if they keep this up will never seen Mark\u2019s children ever again when Maddy goes NC. Some wounds never really heal, you just learn to accept that they\u2019re there. Punishing Maddy for her loss isn\u2019t going to bring Mark back and is not only punishing Maddy twice but also disrespecting Mark\u2019s memory by hurting the woman he loved very much.", "NTA. Maddy is still young and deserves to love and be loved. It is so wonderful to hear that you are supporting your sister in love while she is finding herself again and dating someone new. \n\nYour parents are hurt but it\u2019s not fair for them to treat Maddy this way. They need cut it out immediately or else the kids will grow up to resent their grandparents for trying to keep their mom from being happy. You should talk to them and tell them to start seeing a therapist.\n\nMark wouldn\u2019t want Maddy to live the rest of her life mourning him. He gave her two beautiful jewels and your parents need to focus their attention on them instead of making Maddy\u2019s life difficult.", "NTA.  Your parents are ridiculous and cruel.  A person is allowed to date again after their partner dies.  \n\nLost my mom in my 20s.  I absolutely encouraged my dad to date again. Wife's grandfather started dating in his 80s after his wife died.  We encouraged this 100%\n\nIt is important to be happy.  It isn't possible to cheat on a dead person.  What a stupid expectation.

Grief & tragedy are very strong bonds. Maddy is trying to break that bond... as she should. Your parents sound like they are not ready to let go. \n\nYour parents do not speak for Mark & sadly no amount of loyalty in the world will bring him back. To honor Mark\u2019s life, Maddy & her children must find peace & happiness in their lives. You\u2019re being a wonderful person & sister.\n\nI wish your happy, loving memories of Mark help you find peace & comfort.\n\nNTA", "NTA and good luck to your family at trying to get the kids. No judge would take this seriously. All they\u2019re going to do is drive a large enough wedge that they won\u2019t ever see them.", "NTA. Your family though is full of them. It's been 2 years. (and even if it wasn't but that's another issue) She is allowed all of this and the family needs to mind their business. A judge will laugh in their faces if they even tried.", "Sorry for your loss.  NTA, your parents need some serious help with their grief.  Maddy made a vow till death do us part.  It took her a few years, but she is starting to put her life back together.  That your parents threaten to take her kids is not something she should take lightly.  She needs to contact a lawyer and get papers in place if something happens to her.  Even a brief stay in the hospital can cause issues in who has custody of her kids.  She needs to name who will have temporary custody if she is incapacitated.", "Your parents\u2019 behavior toward your sister in law is unhinged. They need professional grief counseling. \n\nBravo for standing up for her. \nNTA", "NTA.  If you\u2019re brother loved Mandy, he would want her to be happy and to have his children have a father figure they could look up to and protect them.  I have no doubt that Maddy will tell them all about their dad.  Your family is alienating their own grandchildren and they have no legal recourse to taking her children away from her.\n\nOP, your brother would be proud of you.", "Your parents need some professional help.\n\nMark is gone. Tragically young, but gone nonetheless.\n\nNTA, and good for you sticking up for her!", "NTA  and good on you for taking a sensible approach to this.   I hope your family can reconcile themselves to this. \n\nInterestingly,  I find this occurs more often when it is a widow, not a widower.  Maybe ask your family if it was Mark that was left would they want him to never date again?", "I'll talked to them about getting some grief therapy, Cause if they're calling this cheating they need it. And maybe have a sit down talk with them ask them point blank If they really want your sister-in-law to be alone for the next possible 60 - 70 Years? I'd also ask them if this is actually what they're upside about Or if they're actually worried about someone possibly taking the position of father in their grandchildren's lives besides their son. I'll tell them their reaction is understandable but unreasonable. You all can do stuff to remember your brother Together with the kids beside demanding that his Widow remained single for the rest of her life. Which will only end up with people hurt. \n\nThey're also currently risking their relationship with their grandchildren their mother here. No court is gonna give to them rights to the grandchildren because they don't like the fact that the mother started dating again. That's ridiculous they need a reality truck. Before they start burning bown bridgers they might not be able to rebuild. I'm so sorry you lost your brother, and I hope your parents can see reason. I wish you and You're family the best of luck NTA.", "My aunt was engaged at 24 to a good man.\n\nHe got cancer and refused to marry her.\n\nChemo killed it.\n\nThey married a year later.\n\n5 years later it returned.\n\nHe died a year later.\n\nShe, at the age of 30, never dated or anything again. \n\nShe died at 76.\n\nI dont know if it was her choice, her faith, love or family influence etc\n\nBut that is a **long** time to be alone for a human, we are social creature after all.", "NTA. Your parents are so in the wrong here!! Kudos to you for being there for your SIL. \n\nThis reminds me of the backlash Patton Oswalt received after he got engaged a year after his 1st wife died. A columnist wrote a brilliant reply to the critics. https://ericaroman.me/2017/07/07/a-widows-rage-defense-of-patton-oswalts-engagement/", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. The rest of the family is being highly unreasonable about this situation. They can\u2019t expect her to be alone forever.", "NTA- reading stuff like this is why I told my partner, If something happens to me that I want them to be happy.  Whatever that looks like. Just know that once we're both on the other side, I have dips.", "NTA and your family is letting grief turn them into villains. Stand firm! Since they want to treat her that way, she should just remove herself and her kids from them altogether.\n\nEdit: she can't cheat on a late spouse.", "I'm assuming you belong to a culture that allows for remarriage after the death of a spouse.  Nta. I've told my husband that if I predecease him that I hope he moves on. I did tell him that if we still have minor children that I think he should wait a couple years first before dating. But I don't want him alone forever.  I don't know if I'd date again though if he were to die first. Still  Nta", "Til death do us part. That was the deal.\n\nShe upheld her end. NTA", "NTA - putting someone\u2019s happiness first over your own agenda. You are a great person OP", "Definitely NTA. While I can understand it might be hard on your family to see her move on because it once again reminds them your brother can\u2019t it\u2019s insane to expect the world to stop because he died. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you are there for your SIL. Maybe you can help your parents get counseling?", "NTA for sure. You're absolutely right, you can't cheat on the dead.", "NTA\n\nIf your brother loved her, and it really sounds like he did, then I can guarantee that he would want her to be able to be happy, and half a life that doesn't revolve around forever mourning him. \n\nHonestly your family are being giant AH by trying to force her to spend the rest of her life in celibacy, in order to honour some twisted ideal they have, of what mourning should be. \n\nHonestly after the threats to take her children from her, I would personally cut them out of my life completely. That is so far over the line that they can't even see the line anymore.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. She's 28, dude! Mark would probably want her to move on and continue living because of course she'll always love him and remember him, but she has every right to want to feel happy and secure in a relationship. Otherwise they're expecting her to go through life miserable and unhappy without a partner. A partner is just someone to build a life with and to support and receive support from. Nobody can expect her to go on without that. As long as the new guy supports her need to grieve and respects her love for her late husband and isn't weirdly insecure about it or anything, it's completely okay to move on and not even remotely too early to move on. You're a wonder SIL, btw. She's lucky to have your support on this. Angering her in laws is probably hard on her. Age isn't even a factor of if either, just more of a reason for her to move in. She has a whole life ahead of her and she can still grow old with someone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur family are tha AHs. Tell maddy to go no contact with them.", "NTA OP, keep being there and supporting her your family are the AH here.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s allowed to try and find happiness again after tragedy. Your parents are WAAAYYY out of line and should possibly look into some kind of grief counseling.", "NTA.\n\nYou absolutely did nothing wrong nor did your SIL. Losing a family member is very heartbreaking but to expect her to never move on is insane. Side note but she needs to be cautious with any future visits (if any) with those angry family members and such if they are threatening to take her kids.", "NTA. Your parents are clearly not dealing with their grief because they\u2019re acting crazy. Did they expect her to just hop in the grave with him?", "NTA but your parents and anyone expecting her to be chaste for the rest of her life sure is.", "NTA.", "NTA;  Marriage ends at death do us part.  Neither you nor or your former SIL are in the wrong.  She should be able to move on in her life and there is nothing wrong with you being close to your brother's widow.", "NTA I would simply point out that most traditional wedding vows state \u201cTill Death Do We Part.\u201d Marriage is a contract between two people. Their contract ended with his death. She held to her end of their contract. Now it is up to your parents to do right by their son, mourn and allow his widow to move on with their blessing.", "NTA \n\nSo do your parents think she should stay single forever until she's dead and then she can be reunited with her dead husband?", "NTA it\u2019s kind of you to defend her and shows good character that you value her happiness despite the grief", "Unbelievably selfish to expect someone's life to end when their spouse's does. Insane. \n\nNTA.", "Nta, neither of you did anything wrong, maddy can still love your brother and be with someone else. She will never forget him and there\u2019s nothing wrong with her moving on and your parents and family need some grief counseling or something bc they\u2019re really terrible for saying she\u2019s bad for moving on", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, death did they part.\n\nSecondly, if your brother truly loved your SIL, he would want her to be happy, even if that means loving someone else. If David is a good guy, he would allow SIL to keep the memory of her two kids father alive, and keep in contact with your family, which you haven't indicated he wants to stop contact. The community can only do so much when it comes to the kids, and having a second adult for SIL to bounce ideas off is a good thing. \n\nSupporting Maddy with her dating David is a good thing.", "NTA, your family needs therapy", "NTA\n\nPlease tell your parents that your brother would want her to find love and happiness.  He wouldn't want them to be treating her so badly.\n\nMaybe you all need family/grief counseling to help resolve this issue.", "NTA.  You are a wonderful friend and support to Maddy and the nibblings.  She will always love Mark and it is tragic he died so young.  And she deserves a chance to be happy again.  You are showing loyalty to both Maddy and Mark by helping her to realize it is okay to move on, not forget but still be able hopefully have a happy and fulfilling life while still honoring Mark's memory.", "NTA. So sorry about your brother. The thing is your brother is gone, your SIL is very much alive. My only hope for her is that she is careful as to who she brings into the children\u2019s life. Thank you for supporting your SIL.", "NTA - but your parents are!!!  They way they are acting, they will lose access to the grandchildren.  \n\nI am a widow, it was over 10 years ago when I was in my mid 40s with a teenager.  He is grown and on his own.  When he went off to college, I started dating, because I needed to stop being \u201cthe widow\u201d\u2026\n\nYour parents need grief therapy.  Their son was gone far too soon, and it is unfair and cruel to expect a 28 yr old widow to stay single for the rest of her life. She needs to be out enjoying life, her kids need to see her enjoying life.  \n\nSeriously, If they don\u2019t get help and change their attitude, they will lose access to their grandkids, because your SIL can\u2019t have them poisoning her kids and treating her so rudely and disrespectfully.  You should encourage them to get therapy or join a grief counseling group and SIL to put distance between her/kids and your parents until they have a change in attitude and apologize.  If they go to church, call the pastor and ask for help in this situation.  They might listen to the pastor.", "NTA. Please continue to support Maddy. Your family really thinks that your brother would want her to spend the rest of her life alone? If he loved her he\u2019d want her to be happy. I\u2019m sorry about your brother. I\u2019m sorry your parents lost their son,  but their going to lose their grandchildren too if they aren\u2019t careful.", "Before I say this, you have my deepest condolences. Have your parents heard of the marriage vows that include, \"until death do you part\"? \n\nThey're still grieving, which is understandable, but it's irrational of them to consider Maddy's dating as cheating on her deceased husband. \n\nShe's done nothing wrong and remains the mother of their grandchildren. \n\nI hope Maddy finds happiness following this heartbreaking loss and your parents and the rest of the family come around to seeing reason.

Even if she moved on a year after that\u2019s still her business grieving the loss is different to moving forward in life. She could still be grieving her husbands loss and be ready to move on. Now making sure the new boyfriend is acknowledging that and helpful to her grieving. Because in my opinion grief is like the ocean. It comes in waves and there will be days when it\u2019s calm and peaceful and you don\u2019t feel it as much then there will be days where it\u2019s like a tsunami hitting the shore. Days where it\u2019s a little choppy and it\u2019s slightly painful. That\u2019s how I see it and this continues I feel like for the rest of your days on the earth. Maybe my take is wrong but having someone who understands that and is willing to be ok with that and knowing that if he was still alive that they would not have been together. A lot of men and women start dating a widow not realizing this and in the end it hurts the widow a lot because it turns into a weird like competition in the SO\u2019s head and I\u2019ve heard a lot of horrible stories about that kind of thing. Not saying that is the case here obviously I don\u2019t know anyone in this situation I\u2019m just giving some advice based off my own experiences/ stories from others.
