I'm not sure how else that can be perceived.", "And I asked you, if you had read the conversation you butted into and you asked \"wich comversation\" and simply repeat yourself over and over and over again whil, again, I did understand you- the first time.\n\n\nDo a comment and not a reply for monologues", "1. I asked which comment you were referring to because I believed I had read them all. I was asking you to clarify. \n\n2. If you think leaving a comment on Reddit is \"butting in\" to a conversation....just...lol\n\n3. I'm unsure why your belief that parents should not have free days except for once a month has anything to do which me offering a solution to family time. I was responding to the other commenter saying that they know someone who has free time every week and suggesting how that is totally plausible and could work for them. \n\nPS: is there a reason for you to downvote my comments when you are already expressing your displeasure through your replies?\n\nEDIT: How funny that instead of reading my comment and replying, you edit your comment saying that I'm going on a monologue. Wasn't this whole chain because you thought I failed to read and understand *your* comments? I made a reply instead of a top-level comment because I was responding to you and someone else! Why would I make a whole new comment thread to respond?\n\nEDIT 2: Well I would love to read your reply, but you blocked me I think, so I have no clue what you've said \ud83e\udd37", "NTA - he chooses to veg out on screen time with his do nothing day and you choose to sleep half of it away. Just because he doesn\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t make it not right for you. We are all wired differently.", "NTA. He can truly stfu", "I want to say NTA.  But if you sleep in until noon, then he has a full day at the weekend to himself - does this mean you spend 1/2 day at the weekend as a family doing things together?  I\u2019m not saying you should change but with two kids - is his full day every weekend sustainable?", "Hahahaha he thinks he should still get a full DAY off when you have CHILDREN?", "NTA. At all.", "Nta. If he doesn't stop complaining start speaking up about his time.", "NTA he is being an asshole by guilting you for how you recharge. That's a load of shit.", "NTA and frankly he's lucky. I never would have agreed to his little free day thing to begin with. I'm not his housekeeper. I'm going to expect things every day, because he's an adult. If it needs to be done, I expect it to be done.", "Your husband spends 50% of the non-work family time he has doing whatever he wants, playing video games, and having no responsibilities? Yikes. That\u2019s an insane arrangement to maintain with young kids.", "NTA. \n\nI think this situation will one day be untenable for both of you. Your husband sounds like he grew up in a house where sleep is shameful (my dad, who is 70, pulls this shit as well). It is important, however, in a partner to understand that what one person needs and desires is different than what another needs and desires, and to respect it without constant belittlement or negativity. If your husband is incapable of understanding that it will degrade your marriage in future situations, regardless of what the arrangement is.", "NTA.\n\n> Yet week after week, he makes comments and complains that I\u2019m \u201cwasting my life away\u201d.\n\nWhat, exactly, is he doing that's so fucking important on his days where nothing is expected of him?  Writing the Next Great American Novel?  Curing cancer?  Brokering world peace?  No?  Then maybe he can get the fuck off his high horse, because the lack of oxygen way up there is making him act like an asshole.  If he's not _at least_ doing something to improve the household on his \"day off,\" (laundry, dishes, home improvement, etc.) he can get bent.\n\nI don't know how he's managed to make it so long with a \"do nothing day\" on Saturdays, but he needs to learn that he's a parent now.  That shit don't fly anymore.  I hope to $diety he's actually being an active parent on his \"do nothing day\" and not just pawning all the parenting off on you.  If not, you're a damn saint and I don't know how you've managed to hold your shit together for so long.\n\nWhat's going to happen when they need to be in different places at the same time for different activities?  With an > 3 year gap you can't just \"put them on the same team\" (excuse me, the youth coach in me needs to seethe in anger at that for a moment) even if they were to do the same things.", "A day off per month is much more acceptable and can be planned around. Such as taking the kids out once a month to a park or play room. \n\nI Agree fully, ESH because parenting is failing when we start counting tit-for-tat. If you want to sleep in that's fine, but stop allowing him to say you can't switch his days. Parenting means we don't get a day off anymore.", "I'm a gaming momma married to my gaming husband.\n\nVideo games are a wasted day once kids are older. If chores are caught up, but the kids are home you gotta be the parent and limit screen time. Those little eyes watching you will think it's ok to blow every Saturday", "\nSo he gets a whole day to himself and he\u2019s resentful of the few hours you take for yourself", "Maybe if you had your sleep in day on a different day than your husband gets his one day? It might eliminate a lot of tension. If you are sleeping till noon on his special day than he still has responsibility till noon. Maybe you get Sunday he gets Saturday? Because this seems to be the issue.", "Wait. I'm finally understanding now. So, in essence, you're saying that you sleep until noon, whereas your husband sleeps until 10 at the latest?", "My oldest is five and already has two different activities, birthday parties, play dates. Like OP\u2019s husband is *already* missing this stuff.", "If every single Saturday I had from noon-rest of the day to do whatever I wanted with no expectations, I\u2019d be *thrilled*", "She sleeps until noon. He then does nothing the rest of the day and sleeps in the next day. She does not get her own do nothing day and he takes issue with her sleeping in. From reading her comments, she has tried to swap sleep in days with him so his sleep in day is the same as his do nothing day and her sleep in day doesn\u2019t interfere with his do nothing day but he\u2019s refused. Sounds like he wants it to be his way with no compromise which isn\u2019t exactly fair. She shouldn\u2019t get zero \u201cme time\u201d while he gets a  do nothing day and an extra sleep in day.", "I'm so baffled by this. We have two young kids and trying to plan a day to sleep in or a steady day for projects seems impossible. Do you not have activities/social engagements/etc? I can't imagine living this inflexibly with kids.", "Even more reason why his sleep in day should also be his do nothing day.", "NTA. You need rest! Especially as a teacher. If he wants you to give up your rest time, then he should give up his too. It's YOUR time, you can recharge however you see fit, the same way that he does.  \n\n\n...Also, wait, does he STILL get an entire day to himself? Because if so, you should be getting a whole day for yourself too.", "NTA. He definitely wants his cake and to eat it too", "So he gets a whole day and you only get a few hours? And he constantly complains week after week? NTA, frankly I'd give him the choice between family counseling or divorce...it might not seem much but I've been on the receiving end of this behavior. It's like death by a thousand cuts...one incident is like whatever, the tenth pisses you off, the hundredth drives you crazy, the thousandth and you're ready to chuck him off the planet.", "When he asked for a full day off to himself, what about him made you think, \u201cDamn, i need to have babies with this man\u201d?? NTA but he showed you who he was way before babies came into the pic", "NTA. Wow.", "We don\u2019t even have kids and we have this fight all the time. I \u201csleep the day away\u201d and that\u2019s bad but he plays Xbox for 15 hours and throws a fit when house stuff pops up he has to deal with.", "idk it half a day of 'off time' worked well enough for my parents. my mom was AFK at her friends during her time, and my dad was listening to classical music while sprawled on the living room couch in his undies. \n\nand then he would go to the yard in said undies and do some gardening, which annoyed our more religious neighbors to the extent that they brought missionaries to lecture him.", "Yeah you should get the whole day too.", ">we would each get a morning on the weekend to sleep in.\n\nI read that as his day was Saturday and I guess her day is Sunday.\n\nEdit: Now I've read her other comments and I'm confused.", "Yeah, this was confusing as fuck because there's no world where I thought that would ever happen.", "If that were the only difference in the dynamic, then I would agree. If they are sharing the household responsibilities equally and each getting a sleep in day, then yes, they should have the same amount of time to sleep in. However, that is not the dynamic. In addition to his sleep in day, he gets a separate day where he has no responsibilities. She does not get a no responsibilities day. \n\nSo on Saturdays, she sleeps in. While she\u2019s sleeping in, he is caring for the kids. Once she wakes up, she takes over and he does nothing, except for occasionally changing a diaper or getting them food. She does everything else. Then on Sundays, he sleeps in. She cares for the kids. He gets up and he helps her care for the kids and do household work, which they both do. If things were fair, she would get to do nothing once he wakes up. That is the issue. She\u2019s doing everything both days and he\u2019s complaining that she\u2019s sleeping in longer than him.", "There\u2019s also playing a video game and playing a video game all day.", "Hold up, people seem to be getting the wrong idea where your husband literally won't get up to help with anything, even this kids.\n\nBut you say he helps with the kids on his day off, he just doesn't want to do....what specifically?\nHave projects?  Do chores?  \n\nYou want one day a week where you do a project around the house?  That seems a little insane.  If his one day of \"no expectations\" simply means he tries to get all his chores done during the week, and doesn't want to paint the garage every Saturday, he's not an asshole.\n\nBoth of you seem to have this very specific rigidly planned week and I don't know if there's any fix for that.  Just like ...be more flexible", "The one where you said what a lot of other people do \"simply doesn't work\". And then when someone replied with a real world example of it working, you suggested another reason why it wouldn't work.\n\nWhen someone *else* suggested a way **that** could work, you got mad that people don't just accept your answer as the one truth above all else. Suggesting they didn't understand your great wisdom.\n\nThen you acted like people discussing on a discussion forum are somehow \"butting in\".\n\nThen you accused them of intentionally misunderstanding you and repeating themselves over and over.\n\nSo, for the record, this is what \"butting in\" looks like.", "Sleep debt isn\u2019t a thing", "Yeah, this whole thing is just fucking weird.  Every single moment of their lives seems to have these rigid rules.", "It's not a literal phrase. It's used to describe the feeling of tiredness that comes from not having adequate sleep, which can cause a person to sleep longer than normal. But I'm sure you already knew that and are just arguing for the sake of it now. You also completely failed to answer my question."]}
