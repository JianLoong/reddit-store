Weekends are for relaxing, sure.  BUT, they're also for catching up on chores and taking care of the kids.  It's unreasonable for any parent to expect a complete, duty-free day off.  What y'all have is a recipe for miscommunication and resentment.", "Nta, tell him to shut up and that he needs to respect you.", "ESH. Yoir arrangements don't work with children.

We have a 2 year old and almost 4 year old. He usually takes Saturdays and I usually take Sundays. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work out and one of us misses our sleep in day, but that\u2019s just part of having kids. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to actually sleep in and I (or he) will just lay in bed and watch tv or play on my phone. \nIt\u2019s unrealistic to have an entire day of doing nothing when you have kids. It also sounds like he has a day where he\u2019s expected to do nothing, but on your sleep in day, you\u2019re still doing everything. I do think it\u2019s realistic to set a cut off though. I would be annoyed if he slept in until 3 pm or something, but if your husband is having a sleep in day and then a separate day where he does little to nothing, that\u2019s really unacceptable now that you have kids.

Same difference.", "NTA.", "The husband is being a huge asshole for whining about this every week even though (a) she has an early morning job and needs to catch up on sleep and (b) they agreed to it and (c) it causes no harm to anyone else. I'm glad he's not actually waking you up. I'd put a stop to this before he starts accidentally making lots of noise early on your sleep in day.\n\nAlso, your setup doesn't seem fair at all. He gets an entire day off each week. And you only get to sleep in for one morning (so 1/3 day off at most). And he complains about this. Am I missing something?", "Seriously. Even school sports are on the weekends I thought I would get to sleep but no it\u2019s just as bad.", "I realize I may have to change my expectations about sleeping in once they start sports.", "Of course this doesn\u2019t always play out that way. We do have weekends where there are events and what not. And if sleeping in until noon is my form of self care, not crazy IMO. And again, as stated in my original post, we both don\u2019t do nothing on Saturdays. There is just the expectation that if there are no events planned that day, we save the extra household duties/chores for Sunday. We still both take care of the kids.", "Then NTA. You have equal alone time and the other can hold down the fort for half a day. If he wants both of you to have less alone time, that\u2019s with a discussion, but he doesn\u2019t get to pick how you use it. Long term, this probably won\u2019t work but having a toddler is hard", "Seems like what would be fair would be for you two to get to sleep in to about the same time on your \"catch up\" days. I get that you both want one day to rest and get a break, but I also see his point that if he is only sleeping in until say 9 am, and you are taking half the day and sleeping in until noon or 1 pm, that's not really fair, especially when you have a 2 and 5 year old that he's having to chase around. \n\nLike I said, I think that sort of schedule works great when you're single, but you're parents now and I don't think sleeping half the day away is a luxury that's really fair if you're doing it every weekend.", "OP may have assumed that her husband would behave like an adult.", "Her husband gets up at 10, she gets up at noon.

He doesn't need both days.", "Eh.... did you read the comment from me before the comment you replied too?", "But OP doesn't get a full day off.

I think with a lot of these, we are missing a good amount of context. I try not to make judgement without at least having a good grasp on the scenario. I also think a lot of these couple issues could be mended with better communication between the couple", "Agree. It sounds like he views doing childcare as a favor rather than the default. OP claims they split the chores but I'm starting to wonder if she does the majority of the work and just doesn't notice. I mean if she does all the childcare and cooking on one day per week then she's automatically doing more than half the household labor, unless he's really making up for it on other days. In a lot of straight couples I think this sort of thing happens often without either person noticing. Women do a lot of household work automatically and men do some work but view it as \"extra\" or \"helping out.\" So the husband feels entitled to take a whole day free from \"extra\" work but gets upset when his wife takes a couple hours off from working.", "Feeds them breakfast, changes the baby, and does what a parent does.
