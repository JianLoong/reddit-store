We made the deal after our first born that we would each get a morning on the weekend to sleep in. I\u2019m a teacher, and if you know anything about teacher tired, you\u2019ll know why I have zero guilt about sleeping in until usually noon on my sleep in day. My husband isn\u2019t built that way. The latest I think he\u2019s slept is until 10, but he\u2019s usually up earlier than that. \n\nHe has a major problem with me sleeping in until noon. I tell him that it\u2019s my thing that\u2019s important to me. It\u2019s my self care. Yet week after week, he makes comments and complains that I\u2019m \u201cwasting my life away\u201d. I consider sitting on the couch playing video games or watching TV for an entire Saturday to be a colossal waste of time, but I agreed to that and it seemed important to him so I keep my opinions to myself. \n\nThose days look different now because we have kids. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ignoring them. He does change a diaper when needed or help make their lunch or watch them if I\u2019m running errands.

You are a team and it takes both of you working together.", "OP says in the post that hubby won't sleep in after 10 and is usually up before. Also OP states hubby still has responsibilities on his \"off day\"", "We split all of the parenting and household duties throughout the week pretty well.

Yes, but I\u2019ve offered to trade days numerous times and he says no because he wants to sleep in on Sundays.", "I don\u2019t know how you read that we take the entire weekend off with two kids. I said that we take turns sleeping in and whoever isn\u2019t sleeping in cares for the kids. I also mentioned that his on his \u201cday off\u201d he still helps with the kids. He just doesn\u2019t want extra projects or household responsibilities on Saturdays. My problem isn\u2019t with the arrangement per se. It\u2019s with him taking issue with how late I sleep in. Because if he wants a day where there are no extra duties (outside of caring for our children of course), then he shouldn\u2019t be upset because I take a couple extra hours to catch up on sleep.", "Wouldn\u2019t that be so lovely if I had the finances for a sitter or that our parents lived close?

Asking to sleep in once a week doesn\u2019t make me a bad parent.", "People have different sleep patterns and different needs for sleep. Respecting everyone's sleep needs in the household isn't very hard, but will require some communication skills.", "So he is entitled to a relaxing day but you aren't? NTA, y'all need to come up with a better system that applies equally to both of you. Frankly you should have discussed this before the first child, definitely after the first child, and before the second child came into play. Weird that this wasn't sorted 2 kids ago tbh", "Ummm, his sleep in day should absolutely be on his nothing day. He\u2019s tricked you into letting them be 2 different days. How can he have a nothing day on your sleep in day? Sleeping in is the most nothing you can do, so I don\u2019t understand how he has a separate day for that. Ridiculous, and NTA.", "Hang on, do you mean he has a do nothing day *and* and a sleep in day?", "Wouldn\u2019t his do nothing day be his sleep in day?\n\nHow can he bug you about sleeping in if he does it the next day.\n\nNTA based on him having trying to have two days without childcare responsibility\n\nThis should be pretty easy,  he has one day you have the other.  And when it\u2019s the other persons day the not-day person does the kid detail.", "So you guys have the same \"day off\"?", "To be clear, I find the expectation that each parent get a full day off to be unreasonable. The rest of it is fixable, sure.", "Yes. That is correct. But he cares for the kids on my sleep in day.

I\u2019ve tried offering to switch sleep in days, but he doesn\u2019t want to.", "I suppose. I wanted one day where we do a project around the house. We landed on Sundays for that. He really wanted Saturday to be his day off but won\u2019t switch sleep in days with me. So I sleep in on Saturdays.", "NTA, but honestly, that's a majorly fucked up arrangement y'all have.  Weekends are for relaxing, sure.  BUT, they're also for catching up on chores and taking care of the kids.  It's unreasonable for any parent to expect a complete, duty-free day off.  What y'all have is a recipe for miscommunication and resentment.", "Nta, tell him to shut up and that he needs to respect you.", "ESH. Yoir arrangements don't work with children. To have a totally free Saturday every week is absolutely crazy. And sleeping in until noon every Saturday \"just because\" is crazy, too. Are there no activities planned for weekends, ever? I don't get it.", "NTA", "Honestly I'd consider going to a hotel the night of my sleep-in day so that you can sleep as late as you want without being pestered, then come home.", "My husband and I split sleep in days on the weekends too. We have a 2 year old and almost 4 year old. He usually takes Saturdays and I usually take Sundays. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work out and one of us misses our sleep in day, but that\u2019s just part of having kids. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to actually sleep in and I (or he) will just lay in bed and watch tv or play on my phone. \nIt\u2019s unrealistic to have an entire day of doing nothing when you have kids. It also sounds like he has a day where he\u2019s expected to do nothing, but on your sleep in day, you\u2019re still doing everything. I do think it\u2019s realistic to set a cut off though. I would be annoyed if he slept in until 3 pm or something, but if your husband is having a sleep in day and then a separate day where he does little to nothing, that\u2019s really unacceptable now that you have kids. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTime to tell him that a \"free day\" doesn't happen once you are a parent.  \n\nHe can have a few hours on Saturday to do nothing, you get a few hours on Saturday or Sunday to sleep.  Same difference.", "NTA.", "The husband is being a huge asshole for whining about this every week even though (a) she has an early morning job and needs to catch up on sleep and (b) they agreed to it and (c) it causes no harm to anyone else. I'm glad he's not actually waking you up. I'd put a stop to this before he starts accidentally making lots of noise early on your sleep in day.\n\nAlso, your setup doesn't seem fair at all. He gets an entire day off each week. And you only get to sleep in for one morning (so 1/3 day off at most). And he complains about this. Am I missing something?", "Seriously. Even school sports are on the weekends I thought I would get to sleep but no it\u2019s just as bad.", "I realize I may have to change my expectations about sleeping in once they start sports.", "Of course this doesn\u2019t always play out that way. We do have weekends where there are events and what not. And if sleeping in until noon is my form of self care, not crazy IMO. And again, as stated in my original post, we both don\u2019t do nothing on Saturdays. There is just the expectation that if there are no events planned that day, we save the extra household duties/chores for Sunday. We still both take care of the kids.", "Then NTA. You have equal alone time and the other can hold down the fort for half a day. If he wants both of you to have less alone time, that\u2019s with a discussion, but he doesn\u2019t get to pick how you use it. Long term, this probably won\u2019t work but having a toddler is hard", "Seems like what would be fair would be for you two to get to sleep in to about the same time on your \"catch up\" days. I get that you both want one day to rest and get a break, but I also see his point that if he is only sleeping in until say 9 am, and you are taking half the day and sleeping in until noon or 1 pm, that's not really fair, especially when you have a 2 and 5 year old that he's having to chase around. \n\nLike I said, I think that sort of schedule works great when you're single, but you're parents now and I don't think sleeping half the day away is a luxury that's really fair if you're doing it every weekend.", "OP may have assumed that her husband would behave like an adult.", "Her husband gets up at 10, she gets up at noon. That's only 2 hours difference. Nothing about that is \"sleeping half the day away ccx", "\"Projects or household responsibilities\" \ud83d\ude44 bruh what about in the future when the kids need shuffling on Saturdays. He's gonna cry and moan that it's not his day off.       \n\n\nHomeboy needs to recognize letting her sleep a few hours is easier than having your kids 50% of the time with 100% of all the responsibilities", "Kid-care is not optional and it is not a favor. Your husband is not the babysitter; he is the dad, and he is supposed to provide care to keep them alive and well rather than as a favor to their mom/his wife/co-parent.
