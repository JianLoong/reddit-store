Onto the issue. \n\nMy husband and I (both 20s) have been together for about 8 years. This may seem like a silly issue but I want some outside perspective. My husband farts all day/night no matter who's around and doesn't bat an eye, but I on the other hand have never farted in front of him. I hold it in until I can slip away and let one rip. \n\nTonight we were discussing basic hygiene and somehow farting came up and the conversation went like:\n\nMe: What would you do if I just blasted ass? \nHim: Don't.\nMe: Why not?\nHim:It would be nasty!\nMe:  But you blast ass all the time!!\nHim: but it would be gross if you did... until you're old.\nMe: So you expect me to not fart in front of you for the rest of my life?!\nHim: yeah.\nMe: okay fine but I'm gonna blast the biggest fart I can when I'm in diapers.\n\nThen he said I'm gross and being an asshole about it. I think it should be normal for couples to fart in front of each other. I also farted right after he said it was gross and thats when he called me an asshole. Maybe I crossed a boundary of his.

When I first moved in with my partner I was nervous to poop with him in the house and fart around him and he obviously noticed quite quickly and asked why I was so worried about him knowing that I poop and fart. I realised I was being immature and now I don\u2019t think twice about farting in front of him. Sometimes he\u2019ll walk into the bathroom while I\u2019m mid poop because he just has to show me or tell me something and he\u2019ll just stand there chatting while I poop, he doesn\u2019t find it nasty at all.

Did you notice this before you got married?", "How can you have crossed a boundary by farting if he farts all the time?\n\nEdit: NTA and honestly his hipocrisy (and misogyny) would be enough reason for me to divorce him.", "Soooooo he views you as what...a sex trophy? Cause he certainly doesn't sound like he views you as an actual person.  I can't even believe anyone like this would even have kids. I sure hope it's not a girl so she's not being taught these ridiculous standards...it feels like it's waaaaay too late to say this now but omg OP, you can do so much better \ud83d\ude29", "NTA. Your husband is a misogynist and believes women should behave so that they remain attractive to him at all times. So no farting and I wouldn't ever mention you poop or have periods, just in cass. \nHe even has the mosogynistic grace to tell you that once you are old, read unattractive to him, then you can fart in front of him. As long as nothing you do ever affects his desire to fuck you, even being a full human being. And obvs he won't want to fuck you when your old, you'd be old, so you're good a that point. \n\nHe's fine though, he's a man who doesn't need to put any effort into being attractive to you. Why should he? So he can fart it up while you stay in your box of his expectations. \n\nI'm surprised you guys have been together 8 years, and you have not been regularly farting in front of him. My partner got told early on that I'm a gassy person, I don't try to intentionally be gross at any point, but I'm not holding it in or disappearing and learn to accept it. \nWe found that my farts are loud but rarely smell, whereas he can only produce silent deadly. He is lethal. Anyway, acceptance of natural bodily functions is normal in a relationship.", "NTA. Do you have to wait until he leaves to poop?

You can get nasty gut aches from holding it in. When we're in a childish mood, hubby and I cropdust each other. We almost pee ourselves from laughter.", "NTA. If he thinks it is OK to drop one in front of you then you absolutely can fire off a gassy in front of him. Just let it rip and damn the consequences. My wife and I have been together for over 15 years and neither one of us worries if the other farts - we usually chuckle.", "Nta, its a bodily function.  Are you supposed to not use the bathroom either? Not sweat? It *is* a little gross but thats simply the nature of being a squishy meat creature. Being alive and functioning normally leads to being at least just a little gross.", "NTA\n\nIs that guy as prissy about hygiene products as well? Does he go into a shock if he sees a pack of tampons or pads?", "What the hell? He's a child. Fart away. My wife slipped a fart on one of our very first dates. We laughed. You're human.

I don't understand people who think like your husband.", "NTA - Normal to fart in private in front of a significant other whatever your gender\n\nThere are just too many guys who have weird (to me) hang ups about performing masc / femme roles within a partnership that include body functions.

One that cleans the bed when you accidently bleed through the sheets and feel bad about it. They are out there.", "Oh my god. Oh my god. OP, this is utterly bizarre. He couldn\u2019t watch you giving birth? He couldn\u2019t watch his own child coming into the world?? I don\u2019t mean to push on this because oh my god if this were me I would never ever get over it and I don\u2019t want to make you feel worse, but\u2026 when do you expect your husband to finally figure out that you\u2019re a fellow mammal? Because it seems like he\u2019s planning to only recognise your humanity once you\u2019re old - and I\u2019m willing to bet in his brain that means \u2018no longer attractive\u2019 (spoiler, there is no age at which you stop being attractive to someone who loves you).", "He missed the birth of his child? I delivered mine.... one of the best experiences in my life. Is his dad like that to?", "Lady I fart in front of my boyfriend, no lie, upwards of 20 times a day. And he doesn\u2019t even mention them. Because gas is normal and your boyfriend is an ass. Enjoy your sexist man I guess", "Just to make it absolutely crystal clear - he specified that you may fart when you\u2019re \u201cold\u201d because at that point he will already have lost sexual interest in you. He refused to witness the birth of his child because he might feel icky seeing your vagina next time he fucked you. He views you as a sexual object, not a human being and a partner. Your husband is a misogynist and a loser.", "So you can live comfortable because he want a doll with no body function? \n\nAnd he will teach those views to your child.", "People get downvote-y when they're frustrated with posters in shitty situations. The downvotes you're getting right now are just people's way of saying they're angry you married what sounds like an anthropomorphized penis.\n\nHe sounds like he prioritizes his desire to have sex with you, and his future of desiring sex with you, over you as a person.", "You have 2 children.", "Your husband is a disgusting misogynist and yta for putting up with it. I hope you teach your kid better bc with a dad like that....", "pleeeeeease dump this loser. somebody with these kinds of backwards, misogynistic viewpoints shouldn't be rewarded with love.", "And none of your family or his called him out for his bs?", "Omg how do people get like this!", "So wtf are you still with him when he treats you like a second class citizen. You should grow a spine and leave.", "And that didn't ruin your image of him? And this farting thing hasnt either? Why not?", "Correct.", "That's how it's done.", "Lmao we had a dog who most of the time would get startled and stick his nose directly in his ass when he would fart. It's how we knew he farted, actually. It was quite funny.", "It\u2019s because it desexualises the female body. These are the same guys who hate seeing women breastfeed in public and think female underarm hair shouldn\u2019t exist. They can\u2019t let anything tarnish their porn projected fantasies.\n\nThat\u2019s why she\u2019s \u2018allowed\u2019 when she\u2019s old - because he thinks she won\u2019t be a sexual object to him then.", "Yeah, this is terrible. I have a friend who told me that when she gave birth, she made sure her husband \u201cwasn\u2019t at the business end\u201d because she heard seeing childbirth puts men off having sex. Yikes."]}
