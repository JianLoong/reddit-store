She seems pretty hell bent on changing her son's mind and getting him to use Skyler. Will still never understand someone using that name and hating Sky(e). Seems like it's kinda inevitable someone will use it at some point.", "I know! Or like Robert and you hate Bobby, Rob, Bob and Robbie. Or if you hated Tasha but named your kid Natasha. For me it is common sense to make sure you like the potential nicknames the full name brings, or at least you can tolerate them lol.", "She's high on her hatred for the name Sky lol.", "Yeah, I don't understand that. Because surely then he would wonder why I never changed my name or why I don't go by my middle name or something. Kids aren't dumb.", "That's what we're all confused by. The name has Sky in there. It's a very clear part of the whole name. At some point someone was bound to use the name Sky for him and even if it was corrected, it would still make sense why when the name is right in there.", "She hates the name.

Skyler doesn't need a nickname, etc, etc, etc. That's her stance.", "100% agree with you.", "Does it not occur to her she is probably going to damage her relationship with her son over this, she should probably get therapy!", "I really hope he changes his name. Will shut her up real fast.", "The irony is that I myself find Skyler to be more feminine-sounding and Sky to be more masculine-sounding lol", "Parents that think they can control everything about their offspring just erk me. It's almost like they forgot that the things they are raising are just small humans. Kids are not dumb in the slightest, in fact most kids I know have better common sense and respect for other than most adults. Like you said lying to the kid is just going to cause bigger problems and questions nobody is going to be able to answer.", "I think she's ridiculous. I named my kid a name that has many nicknames, and we called her one of those nicknames from the day she was born (to the point when she found out her proper name she thought she was nickname realname lastname, like her real name was her middle name). She's eight now and wants to go exclusively by her real name not her nickname, and as her parents it's an adjustment and more of a mouthful to say, but we're following her choice to identify herself how she wants.\n\nYour sister really should have chosen a different name for her kid if she wasn't going to accept common nicknames of it.", "Unfortunately common sense just isn\u2019t that common. She can live with the consequences of her actions. Her hating it is probably pushing him to use it more lol", "Nope. I think this is one of those \"he will see that I am right!\" things.", "Ofcourse not she probably one of those parents who think she is always right because she is the parent.", "She can't even see how the more she pushes this, the more that kid is going to dig his heels in.", "I've always known both to be more unisex. But just like with other similar names, they can sound more masculine or feminine depending on the people you have met with the name and even sometimes personal style influences how it can sound.\n\nIt's just so strange to me to think it's a huge shock Sky would be used when Sky(ler) is his name. Oh well lol. I'll never understand how her mind works on this.", "It's the same in my experience. A kid will use whatever name and pronouns you tell them you prefer (for yourself). They can make some of the best (meaning random) compliments lol. At a certain age they are also starting to pick up on stuff that makes no sense.", "That's too bad, ywbtah if you lie, I'm glad he has an uncle who is looking out for him and your best move is to let him know you will always be there for him!", "I'm sure you are right unfortunately.", "I was genuinely surprised when someone said Shelby is a rather feminine unisex name. I only knew a guy with that name, and he was an Alaskan fisherman. He was definitely manly lol. As you said, who you've known with a particular name is very influential."]}
