Said it wasn\u2019t fair I got the week off and was saying she really should tell HR and couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d done it. \n\nWe had a little falling out, I told her I needed the break and she just thought it was unfair.

In the UK one receives a letter identifying the two weeks that we\u2019re required by the courts. Employers are obligated to release you for this time. My employers paid me my normal salary during my jury service but they could have refused in which case I could have claimed some money back from the court. My firm would need to suspect something was up to check with the court when I was required and when I wasn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t say I needed the time more BECAUSE I had a child. Just that I used it to spend time with my child.\n\nI\u2019m a solicitor, we\u2019re allowed to serve on juries in the UK now (relatively recent change) on the trial I served the judge asked a few questions and whether I knew either barrister. As I did not I was fine to serve.\n\nFriend is a paralegal and works in a different department. My absence had no affect on her work load.\n\nFirm is 300 people, I\u2019d arranged cover for all my clients for the 2 week period of the jury duty.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious from the comments that I shouldn\u2019t have told my friend and I accept I put her in a difficult position but I just don\u2019t understand why she cared.

We'll leave it at that.", "To answer your question without actively going to every small business and assessing them on a subjective set of criteria which no one will be able to agree on about what comprises an \"ethical\" business not really. \n\n\nIt all would come back to what you consider \"ethical\" however. You could argue that any business that doesn't have a profit-sharing initiative in place that fairly compensates employees for their labour with a portion of profits is unethical, in which case the vast majority of businesses would be unethical because the owner takes all the profits. Or maybe you have a different stance on ethics and look at net benefit vs harm from an organization. In this case, the vast majority of small businesses have relatively small revenue streams and don't have the resources to cause significant damage to anyone while usually providing some benefit.\n\n\nPersonally, I work for a government organization. You could consider the government unethical because they are effectively stealing workers' wages via taxation and providing a range of services that you may or may not agree with in return for this. Maybe you like funding education and infrastructure but dislike funding the military, so is the government unethical because they don't follow your moral standard?\n\n\nMy argument would be that if you could somehow create an objective moral code that everyone agrees is correct then an average person would probably fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum from \"good\" to \"bad\". That would suggest about 50% of businesses would be run by ethical people and 50% by unethical people without taking a correlation between being \"good\"/\"bad\" on the ethical scale and your likelihood of starting a business into account. At that point, there are regulatory bodies in place that would impose consequences on businesses for acting unethically in theory, which should tip the scale in the favour of \"ethical\" businesses. That being said as I mentioned earlier this would imply that everyone agrees to what is or isn't ethical, which obviously will never be the case, so no I can't prove it, that's just the vibe I get based off the premise that the average person will be roughly average when it comes to operating ethically and won't act unethically without significant personal benefit out of fear of consequences.", "How useless is your contribution to your workplace that you sat idly at home without any concern for what was slipping while you were out?
