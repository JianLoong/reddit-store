Wage theft is when a company doesn't properly pay employees (e.g. doesn't give them their overtime or takes money out of their paycheck for a uniform that legally should be paid for by the company, etc.) Stealing money from your employer is just \"theft\" not wage theft.\n\nThe distinction matters.

The court doesn't pay your wages and it doesn't compensate your employer. You might be able to get some expenses paid, but they are capped pretty strongly. Meanwhile employers have to let their workers have time off for jury duty, but they don't have to pay them for that time.\n\nSo when you get an employer who *is* willing to do the right thing and treat jury duty as paid time off, it's really stupid to bite the hand that feeds you. Because if they find out you abused the system, that just makes it likely they'll tighten restrictions and either make future jurors have to jump through a lot more hoops to get the PTO or withdraw it entirely and just fulfil their bare legal minimum of unpaid time off.\n\nAnd whatever you think about the morality of wage theft, you don't fucking tell a fellow employee that you did it.

Once the courts start to pay (like 50 bucks max per day), employers generally don't pay the difference.\n\nUnfortunately, at least in my state saying they can't financially afford it wouldn't initially disqualify them and they would still have to serve. Once they're in court the judge will ask if there's any reason they can't serve which they can explain their situation but then it's up to the judge. Showing up satisfies as serving.\n\nWe're also not on call in the same manner. We're told to check the day before if we need to show up a certain day.

But IF they do pay you,  why wouldn\u2019t they ask for proof before they pay you?  Employers ask for proof for everything else.  You have to submit receipts if you want to reimbursed for travel expenses, for example - they don\u2019t just \u201ctake your word\u201d for it.  You have to submit your vaccination card or official health record to prove you were vaccinated against whatever you needed to be vaccinated against - again, they don\u2019t just take your word for it.\n\nI\u2019m just not understanding why they would assume everyone serves the entire full two weeks when we all know for a fact that isn\u2019t true.  And if we all know that isn\u2019t true, why wouldn\u2019t they need an official account of time served?", "Depends on where you work I suppose, it\u2019s at their discretion- what proof employers need that you were in fact on jury service for that amount of time is completely up to them, I suppose because it\u2019s not obligatory in the UK to pay employees for their time in jury service, that companies don\u2019t tend to have such strict guidelines in terms of evidence needed, but then again it would still vary on company to company what policy they adopt- especially since actually paying your employees for jury duty isn\u2019t even necessary", "Yes, but that's completely different.
