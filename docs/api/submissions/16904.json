Our apartment is a one-bedroom, but we turned the living room into her bedroom by adding a japanese-style divider for privacy. It's not perfect, but it works. I found the apartment for us last year through a family member and did everything with regards to setting up utilities, insurance. But I couldn't afford it on my own and I offered her to be roommates since we are friends I knew she was looking for a place. Since I found the apartment, I have the bedroom. We split everything (rent, etc) 50/50. It's a two-year lease but with a clause that we can break the lease with 1-month notice (its like this because its through my family friends), but we agreed we'd probably stay for 2 years.\n\nSince living together we've had some issues of getting on each other nerves, but thats just roommates. For example I thought she would help more but I found myself setting up everything. I was out town when our furniture arrived and came back the night before I was starting my new job which is a work-from-home position, only to find she had friends come over to assemble all her furniture but not my desk. I was quite upset since I had to stay up to assemble it, but her argument was we never agreed that she'd assemble my furniture. But I thought she'd do it out of courtesy since I found the place and did everything. But otherwise she's been a good roommate, respectful and always on top of her chores.\n\nUntil yesterday when she announced that she wants to live alone, has found a place starting from august and will be moving out. I'm quite honestly completely taken aback and, frankly, pissed. We had agreed we'd live there for 2 years, not one. I pointed this out, but she said that her circumstances had changed: she got a better job now and can afford a better place, and would really like to live alone. She also brought up that she needs a proper door and privacy, but I don't see how this has been THIS much of an issue because I never come into her space without permission and she doesn't even have a boyfriend or anyone to bring over. She offered to help me look for a new roommate but I don't see how I could find anyone who would take over the living room and pay half the rent so she's kinda screwing me over here. I love this apartment and I really don't want to leave. I kinda blew up on her over this because I'm just in shock, this is to sudden and she's leaving me with practically no options other than look for a cheaper place. She said that this isn't her responsibility and that she's leaving and that's it. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683731475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dtj5t/aita_for_not_wanting_my_roommate_to_move_out/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your entitlement is astounding. She doesn\u2019t have a proper bedroom and still pays half of everything. It\u2019s not up to you to decide what level of confort is acceptable to her. \nHere is a question for you, would you consider swapping the sleeping arrangements to make her stay?", "You said it yourself - who would pay half the rent for the living room. So you know it\u2019s not worth it and yet you are still whining. Why don\u2019t you offer your new roommate the room and you take the living room?", "YTA - why was your friend paying 50% when she didn't get to have her own room? At the very  least you should have shouldered more of the rent.\n\nIt's completely understandable that she wants to have her own room and proper privacy. She even gave you several months of heads up about her plans, she didn't leave you high and dry.\n\nAlso last but not least: you sound entitled as hell. There was no reason for her to put your furniture together. Your 'payment' for finding the place was that you got the room. I bet this wasn't the only occasion either when you felt entitled to her time.  \n\n>we've had some issues\n\nsounds like you were an entitled and bossy roommate.\n\nShe doesn't owe you her time, work, friendship or help with your living situation.\n\nI would do some serious self reflection if I were you.", "YTA.\n\n> I don't see how I could find anyone who would take over the living room and pay half the rent so she's kinda screwing me over here.\n\nWhich means you know she's in an undesirable position. You are mad at her for not continuing on in a situation you know is not ideal. If anything, you should've offered to switch spaces.\n\nShe signed saying she could leave with 1 months notice. Shes put up with situation long enough. All the reasons you don't think she needs privacy very well could not be present cause she doesn't have privacy.", "YTA\n\nA major one.  She's paying half living in the living room, sure she agreed to it, but you also agreed to a month-to-month with 30 day notice.  Probably 2 years is not definitely 2 years.\n\nAlso, why would she assemble your furniture without you there?  She's taking responsibility if something were to break.  It's insane that you were upset over this.  Like she said, you never asked her to do it, you somehow expected her read your mind and assemble it because you \"found the place\", no wonder she wanted to get out.", "YTA\n\nYour post basically says you know she's got a shitty deal in the living arrangements and no-one else would be a sucker enough to go for it so you're angry at her that she won't put up with it for another year?? Unbelievable. \n\nI don't know how you don't see you're the AH in this situation.", "YTA. As you said she is paying half the rent, does not even have a full room to themselves and you got annoyed when they did not assemble your furniture(keep in mind there was no agreement to do this).\n\nI can really see why they want to leave. You seem to be taking advantage.", ">two-year lease but with a clause that we can break the lease with 1-month notice\n\nINFO: Is her name on the lease or is it in your name only?\n\n>She offered to help me look for a new roommate but I don't see how I could find anyone who would take over the living room and pay half the rent so she's kinda screwing me over here.\n\nSounds like she's given you three times the notice required by the lease, plus she's offered to assist you in finding another person to take her place \u2013 something she has no obligation to do, plus you make it clear that you know that this 50/50 rent sharing is unfair to her because you will have difficulty finding another person to accept this offer. I N F O: How is *she* screwing *you* over?", "YTA - is wanting a bedroom too much to ask for?  You keep bringing up that you found the place...it was a family/friend deal.  How hard could it have been to find?  You're going to have to either get another roommate or find another place to live.", "No one really wants to live in a public space.  It's something you tolerate if you don't have any options.\n\nI get her leaving is inconvenient for you, but her reasons are valid.\n\nYTA", "YTA...You know she got the bad end of the deal, yet at the same time wonder why she wants her own bedroom?  What are you supposed to do?  You're supposed to find another place to live like everyone does.", "YTA - You can't force her to live with you if she don't want to. She also told you that she want to leave in august so you have a lot of time to find someone else. And if the nobody want to live in a livingroom maybe ask yourself why", "YTA, you split the rent evenly but you're the one living there with a proper bedroom with an actual door. Her living situation sounds pretty bad, regardless of whether or not you come into her space unannounced she still sleeps in a living room, and still has to pay half the rent. You also expected her to assemble your furniture unasked without you even throwing her some money, just because \"you found the apartment\" (which worked out primarily for you since you can't afford it alone but you still get the bedroom.)", "YTA. Sounds like communication wasn't good from the start, you both may own some responsibility there, but what got me is that she's paying 50/50 rent for something that's not even a bedroom without proper privacy. The fact that you haven't gone into her space doesn't mean that you can't, and to some people that's all that matters. I hated dorm life back when I did it, I've rented alone until I bought a house, and man it's so much better that way. Roommates grind on my nerves something fierce. She may be the same way - if so, just respect it and go on.\n\nAnd regarding the 2 years thing, well, if your name is the only one on the lease/utilities, you need to be prepared to pay for it yourself, or replace the roomate quickly.", "YTA\n\n You do realize that she can make her life choices without including you, right? You're not her child so your issues are not her problem.", "YTA. Obviously.\n\n1) the deal was to either stay two years, or give a 30 day notice. She was being nice to you, giving you 3x the notice necessary.\n\n2) you say you\u2019re keeping the bedroom because that was \u2018the deal\u2019 but for some reason think \u2018the deal\u2019 of being able to leave with 30 days (or more) notice doesnt actually apply to her.\n\n3) you assume she only wants a bedroom to bring people over. Privacy, real privacy with walls and a door, can be needed without a significant other to impact that. (Case in point, you want to keep the bedroom.) but also she could be interested in starting a relationship, and has waited specifically because she lives in a living room with zero privacy.\n\n4) you need a roommate to afford that apartment. Any roommate you have is doing you a favor! You finding the apartment means nothing in concern to who has what room or who\u2019s furniture is put together, because even if you found that apartment, you cannot afford the rent alone. Honestly its a weird and useless flex. \n\n5) even if you dont come into her \u2018space\u2019 (assuming you mean past her privacy curtain) **its just a curtain!** anything you\u2019re doing that isnt seperated by a wall has the same sound it would if that curtain wasnt there! \n\nAll in all, this post screamed \u201cme, me, me\u201d with very little consideration to the woman who is your friend, and has been doing you a solid for a year. Especially considering she split the rent 50/50.", "YTA- She hasn't broken a single term of your arrangement with her.  You could have ended things amicably and let her help you find a roommate.  You'd be surprised what people are willing to live in for the right price.  Besides, how would your situation be different if she stayed till next year instead of now?", "You seem to understand why nobody else will want to move in, but you have no understanding for why she wants to move out. That doesn't make sense. Also, her moving out after 1 year, giving nearly 3 months notice, is more than acceptable and not sudden. YTA", "YTA you don't see the problems but clearly she does and she\u00b4s unhappy with the living situation, she wants privacy and deserves to move to a place where she can have that, she gave you notice and offered to help find a new roommate with you. The fact that you admit that you don't think you could find anyone else who would want this set up clearly indicates that you know that the living situation is far from ideal. She is right, it's not her responsibility and she's leaving and that's it. You have to accept it and try to make the best out of the situation. You cannot force someone to be your roommate.", "YTA. She doesn't even have a private bedroom and pays 50%....yeah, good for her for leaving. Good luck finding someone else to cover your bills while camping out in the living room.", "YTA- entitled much?", "YTA. \n\nYou took advantage of your friends immediate need to find a place, and charged her 50/50 for a room with zero privacy. Then bitched that she isn't putting your furniture together. She isn't responsible for you", "YTA- she doesn\u2019t want to live there and is giving you notice per your contract. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in a place, pay half the rent AND not have a real room.", "YTA\nShe's living in your living room, obviously she wants more privacy. Let her be", "Hahaha YTA, you even said it! You won't find anyone to live in the living room AND pay half rent. You knew you were getting a deal here. Yet you still want to beat to death the fact that you found the apartment(through family friends) and set up the utilities? You should of got over yourself when you had the chance.", "YTA and sound extremely entitled. You said yourself you don\u2019t think you could find anyone to pay half without even getting a bedroom, why tf would she??? And she is supposed to put YOUR furniture together?? Girl bye. Hopefully this humbles you.", "YTA\n\nHow can she be paying 50/50 if she doesn't even have a room. Have you ever thought she might not be taking friends over because there's you working and she doesn't have a room for herself ? If you don't want her to leave, suggest switching \"rooms\". \nI don't get how you're so surprised this is happening...", "YTA.   You're TA because you're angry with her for moving on, even though she did so correctly.  She even is willing to help you find someone to take her place!!  She got a better job, she wants her own space.  \"She doesn't have a boyfriend or friends over, so why does it matter\".... She doesn't have a boyfriend or friends over *BECUASE SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE SPACE TO PRIVATELY HOST THEM.* \n\nYou can't find anyone to live in half a room covered by a paper divider because that sucks and you know it.   I know you might not be able to afford a lot and the housing problem isn't something you caused, but you're gonna have to suck this one up.", "YTA\n\n- For making her pay half while you got the only bedroom.\n\n- For expecting her to assemble your desk\u2026 WTF?!\n\n- For being a less than ideal roommate and then acting surprised that she wants to leave\u2026", "YTA - you seem to think that this friendship is transactional, i.e. you thought she would set up your desk for you because you set up the utilities.  It doesn't work like this.  You need to communicate.  Also, she is allowed to live her life.  If her life has been improved and she now has the means to be on her own you have no right to stop her from doing this.  Follow a page from your friends book and find a place that you can afford on your own.  If not, spend a month in the living room instead of your room and see how you like it.", "YTA. You are AMAZINGLY entitled and I am not at all surprised she wants to get away from you. Holy shit.", "YTA if you desperately want her to stay, offer to swap rooms. You stay in the living room and she gets a door. You're also the A H for expecting her to assemble your desk.", "YTA - she pays half while she doesn't have a real bedroom (and you do). You know it's a sh*tty arrangement because you said no one will want to replace her on those terms. And your excuse is that you found the place? Oh big deal OP so she would have paid a round of drinks at a nearby bar and call it even. Seriously what an a$$.", "YTA. You think it's not a problem for her to stay with no privacy, yet you state at the same time no one else would want to move in and live like that. She's leaving within the lease options; she is giving you more than the 30 days you need to break the lease since she's not going until August.", "YTA \"I don't see how I could find anyone who would take over the living room and pay half the rent\"\n\nYou act like you're some hero for locating an apartment and then taking the only actual room in it. You know nobody else would sign up for that deal and you've been taking advantage of your friend. She's well within her rights to move out and she's giving you PLENTY of notice. I'm sorry that this situation, which was beneficial to you, is ending, but you can't expect her to take the short end of the stick forever.", "YTA.  This set up might work for you, but I can easily see why it's not so great for your roommate.  She's paying the same as you and doesn't even have a dedicated, private bedroom like you do.  Sorry, private space matters.  I'd say she's been more than generous agreeing to split 50/50 when in actuality she is NOT getting what you are.  Be happy you've had this good deal for yourself as long as you have.  \n\nSorry you are inconvenienced by her moving out, but that's life with roommates.  Situations change and roommates come and go.  I can totally understand why she's wanting her own space, especially after not really having it for over a year.
