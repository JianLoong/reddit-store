I have issues with her, although I do think she's very nice. They now have a 3 month old. AITAH for not letting them move in with me unless they get rid of their dogs? \n\nA bit of background, my son and dog were living with me temporarily until he found a new place to live. Shortly after moving in, his girlfriend loses her place. Suddenly, she's at my place, which was only supposed to be for 4 months until she went in military duty. That never happened. My son had a good job, but she has no car and slept all day while leaving me to take care of the dog, do all their dishes. I have my own dog and cat. So now we're at 2 dogs, a cat, and she brings her lizard. Then suddenly she gets a snake without asking. Neither would clean up after themselves, nor would they pay rent. They did this for 10-plus months. They wanted to get married. I put my foot down and said not while you are living under my roof. She doesn't even have a job for Pete's sake. Finally, she gets an amazing job. They get pregnant, which I think was planned as a power move to force me to allow them to get married and live with me. \n\nThey finally moved, leave the place a complete shithole. I'm disabled and I was forced to clean a huge mess. She walks out of her job because the other girls were being mean to her. She can't find a job because she's pregnant, still no car. My son loses his job. Was out of work about a month, but got another very good job. They get another dog. So now they have two large dogs and a baby on they way. They have no money for anything and I'm having to give them money left and right. She finds another fucking dog wandering the streets, takes him in, hoping I'll take the dog. I asked repeatedly, is he neutered, did you test him for heartworm? They swear he's HW negative. Jump ahead, she starts work a week ago. I've got the new dog and find out he's HW positive. They both bold face lied to me. So I now have two dogs and a cat. My son calls and says they are being evicted. No surprise there. I cut them off financially a couple months ago. I couldn't afford to pay their bills. I had done so for at least 6 months. So now they basically want to move in but refuse to give up their dogs. I said, I've got a tiny, tiny place. I can't take care of 4 dogs, one of which you already dumped on me and is costing me a ton of money. By the way, she's perfectly happy taking my granddaughter away from her husband to go live with her aunt, who supposedly won't let my son live there. Her place is smaller than mine and full. I get that. My son says, well, I guess I'll live in my car. I said, okay. By the way son, you're telling me your wife is choosing her dog over her husband and taking your daughter to, but You're not separating?

They didn\u2019t appreciate it and didn\u2019t do the bare minimum.  Stop giving them help or handouts so they are forced to adult.", "You know, I reached out to the aunt and asked if they could borrow their camper/trailer for a few months until they found a place. She bashed me and said I should take my son and the dogs. I said, I did agree to take my son and baby and wife, just not the dogs. I said, you could let my son move in. They are married and should stay together. She came back with a bunch more insults and was really rude. Funny how she never answered the question of them using the unused camper. I mean, it's nice and basically a mobile home. And she won't let the dogs move in, so why am I the bad guy here?", "I allowed them to stay with me a few days before the baby was due.  They lived an hour and a half from the hospital. (Good thing too because that baby came in 45 minutes, 1st time mom). So the dog was here, all 4 of them. He is a very sweet dog and really took to me right away. It's kind a long story, but she has some issues. She got pissed at my son when we tried to help her with her post partum. She basically took the baby and called her aunt to pick her up, then threatened not to let my son see his daughter. I said, take your dog with you. She didn't. Her aunt wouldn't let her. So next day I left the house and told my son by the time I get home, he better have his dogs out of my house or I'm taking them to the pound. He took his two, but left the new one. I hadn't 100 percent agreed to keep him, but he kind of bonded with me really quickly. I did discuss with them several times that if I took the dog, they better understand they will not be moving back with their two dogs if they lost their place. It wasn't until a couple months later that he injured his eye, which lead me down a rabbit hole and I found out he had tested positive for heartworm 4 months earlier. And I specifically asked them 5 or 6 times at the hospital to promise me the dog didn't have heartworm. They both looked at me in the eyes and promised, lied. I am okay with keeping the dog, but I'm not okay with them lying.  And they knew I wouldn't take the dog if he has heartworm. So he's going in next week to get neutered and then Oct for HW treatment. He can't be active or get his heart rate up or he could die. Don't need dogs running around olaying. So I'm paying for the dog, so not interested in giving them any more money. And I feel like now the dog is mine. Why should I get rid of him because they are aholes? And believe me, I know how much they have taken advantage. I stop giving them money, they call my parents. They call my sister. I've asked my family to stop giving them money as all we are doing is enabling them. I had to put my foot down. The icing on the cake is my parents are old and needed some yard work done. They got a quote of thousands of dollars. They asked my son if he wanted to do it and they would pay him. He agreed. So they ordered dirt, sod, and my son never came over. His wife was pissed at me, so she didn't want to come over. They were tired and needed to sleep. So my almost 80 year old parents and me, disabled, had to move wheelbarrows of dirt and sod. We couldn't just leave the piles laying around. So my son tells me how much they are behind in rent. My response was, gee, wouldn't it have been nice to do the work and get the $1,500 grandma and grandpa were going to give you. I know I just wrote a book.", "Yes, I was just talking to my sister about this very issue.", "I honestly don't have a problem with dogs. But they go in the room and close the door and leave me to take care of the dogs. One wants to go out constantly. I work from home. And I have a job that it's hard to keep stopping to let the dogs out. Plus I'm taking the new dog in next week to be neutered, then Oct. For heartworm treatment. The dog can't get his heart rate up or he could die. I can't keep him calm with 4 dogs. The other thing is when all 4 dogs are together, they start to become food and toy aggressive. I do agree with you though, the humans suck, not the dog.", "She won't take the dogs. Just the wife and baby. But she expects me to take the dogs and my son. I try to talk to my son about how this is ridiculous, she's choosing her dogs over husband, but she's always on the phone in the background. Neither want to give up their dogs. My son said, Well, I guess I'll live in my car then. I said, okay. Enjoy. I've told them to just stay where they are and try to find a new place as they haven't been served with papers yet. They just got a call from the landlord telling them to be out in three days. They said they don't want any legal trouble preventing them from getting a new place. Nobody listens to me, so I'm not fixing anybody's problems anymore because they didn't listen.", "I'm not offended. It's just been a really rough night. I'm still dealing with all this crap and the manipulation.", "It's hard being manipulated. Especially by people who should be watching out for you."]}
