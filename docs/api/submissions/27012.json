I have issues with her, although I do think she's very nice. They now have a 3 month old. AITAH for not letting them move in with me unless they get rid of their dogs? \n\nA bit of background, my son and dog were living with me temporarily until he found a new place to live. Shortly after moving in, his girlfriend loses her place. Suddenly, she's at my place, which was only supposed to be for 4 months until she went in military duty. That never happened. My son had a good job, but she has no car and slept all day while leaving me to take care of the dog, do all their dishes. I have my own dog and cat. So now we're at 2 dogs, a cat, and she brings her lizard. Then suddenly she gets a snake without asking. Neither would clean up after themselves, nor would they pay rent. They did this for 10-plus months. They wanted to get married. I put my foot down and said not while you are living under my roof. She doesn't even have a job for Pete's sake. Finally, she gets an amazing job. They get pregnant, which I think was planned as a power move to force me to allow them to get married and live with me. \n\nThey finally moved, leave the place a complete shithole. I'm disabled and I was forced to clean a huge mess. She walks out of her job because the other girls were being mean to her. She can't find a job because she's pregnant, still no car. My son loses his job. Was out of work about a month, but got another very good job. They get another dog. So now they have two large dogs and a baby on they way. They have no money for anything and I'm having to give them money left and right. She finds another fucking dog wandering the streets, takes him in, hoping I'll take the dog. I asked repeatedly, is he neutered, did you test him for heartworm? They swear he's HW negative. Jump ahead, she starts work a week ago. I've got the new dog and find out he's HW positive. They both bold face lied to me. So I now have two dogs and a cat. My son calls and says they are being evicted. No surprise there. I cut them off financially a couple months ago. I couldn't afford to pay their bills. I had done so for at least 6 months. So now they basically want to move in but refuse to give up their dogs. I said, I've got a tiny, tiny place. I can't take care of 4 dogs, one of which you already dumped on me and is costing me a ton of money. By the way, she's perfectly happy taking my granddaughter away from her husband to go live with her aunt, who supposedly won't let my son live there. Her place is smaller than mine and full. I get that. My son says, well, I guess I'll live in my car. I said, okay. By the way son, you're telling me your wife is choosing her dog over her husband and taking your daughter to, but You're not separating?

But if I don't, his wife will take his baby and live with her aunt. They both refuse to give up their dogs. They also have a proven history of not taking care of their dogs by picking up waste in the backyard or even getting out of bed to let them out.

Leave your son in the car and DIL & Baby at the Aunts and I'm sure they will soon work out other arrangements when it is clear they can't manipulate you into capitulating.
