If they feel guilty that's their own problem and they shouldn't project their happy memories on your experiences. Rather they should respect you and stop spreading this story and trying to put other children through the experience... every child is different and may react in a different way than you but they shouldn't lie to other parents about your experiences.", "NTA.

You could even mention the similarities to what you saw to a graphic movie that may not have been age appropriate.

That sounds like a nightmare to live through and you are right to tell your parents that the experience was awful for you. You were also right to share your feelings with that other family.

I come from a family of doctors too and growing up there were educational operation CDs in the house which I've always wanted to watch as a kid but I was forbidden because my parents thought it would be traumatising.

They don't mind being handed a clean and wrapped baby, well most don't mind.  You have kept quiet long enough.  Perhaps they don't want people to know the lifetime trauma they subjected you too  I would guess that you did not become a doctor because of this.

It\u2019s a shame you weren\u2019t able to talk to your parents about this before there were so many other people involved, but once the dust has settled, you need to talk to them about your feelings about the matter.

My family told me since then it's been A Story and parents love the thought of it ~~but no one ever asks the kids~~", "I guess I feel like I'm ruining a parents happiness by saying what I think? That's how it wasn't my place and I'm not close to them or their kid so I feel it was out of place", "I don't want to have kids but that's mainly because I dislike kids and I like being alone. This might have some unconscious impact but I'm not sure", "It was at a hospital. My family basically controls all the maternity ward there (is that how is called?) so they were able to let me in as far as I know", "Also remind them that as health professionals, they're desensitized to nudity and gore in a medical setting. \n\nHow did they feel the first time they attended a birth? How do the new interns, student nurses, etc. typically react? \n\nAnd at least a medical student goes in knowing what to expect.
