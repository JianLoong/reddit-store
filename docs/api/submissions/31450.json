{"id": 31450, "submission_id": "180q0dg", "title": "AITA for not being more accomodating towards my MIL?", "selftext": "My husband and I (both in our 30s) have been together for 5 years, married for 2. Overall, our relationship is good but we've had consistent issues with his family complaining that I'm cold, I don't want to spend time with them, I don't want to be a part of their family, etc. On my end, I feel like a lot of it has to do with them consistently not respecting my boundaries, especially when there have been health / pregnancy issues involved. \n\nFor example: \n\n1. The first time I flew to visit them I caught a bad cold and they were upset that I stayed at the house one day instead of making a three-hour drive with them to meet their cousin, eat at a Polish buffet and go for a hike in the rain. \n2. Last year MIL came to visit while I was pregnant, and even though I wasn't feeling well she wanted to do a lot of activities in the heat (farmer's market, go rowing on the lake, etc.) and she pressured me into accompanying her on a lot of these outings. Well, it turned out that I was suffering from severe preeclampsia which was undiagosed - two weeks later I had to have an emergency c-section and we lost the baby in the third trimester. She flew out (without being asked) and then told anyone who would listen that she knew something was wrong because of how tired I was. (I want to note that I don't blame her for the stillbirth - I'm just giving an example of her not respecting my boundaries when I wasn't feeling well and then pretending that didn't happen). \n3. This year we got pregnant again and FIL was in town when I delivered the baby last week. Despite us telling FIL that we would let him know when it was ok for him to visit, he came to the hospital without asking - three hours after I had a c-section he walked into the room with no warning while I was puking and topless (had been trying to nurse). He apologized and ended up coming back the next day but for me the damage was already done and I was really upset. \n\nNow MIL is staying with us for a week to help take care of the baby. I thought things were going fine, then last night (less than 48 hours after she arrived) I was trying to nap and overheard her complaining to my husband that she's going to go home early, she feels like we don't need her, she's not spending enough time with the baby, I'm mad at her (I wasn't), etc. etc. Basically it was all about her and my husband has been asking me to be more accomodating towards her (spend more time talking with her instead of in the bedroom, etc.) \n\nAnd I said no. I've been polite, I've made small talk with her, I've thanked her for her help, the baby now sleeps in her room at night per her request. She and FIL were the first ones to spend time with the baby, even ahead of my own family. But I am not going to spend my time and energy worrying about her feelings when I am one week postpartum and my focus should be on healing and on my baby. AITA for saying I am done trying to accomodate my MIL?

Your husband should be accommodating you and only you. How you mean the baby sleeps in MIL room. What?! 1 week postpartum and you have to deal with all of that, please please have MIL leave yall house. This is not good for your recovery at all. You need peace and calm for your body n mind to heal. Not stress and having to worry about anyone other than yourself and your baby.", "NTA - She was trying to Steamroll you into doing everything her way.

MIL has interfered in your pregnancies and PP life far too long already, with complete disregard for your health and that of the babies. It's plain to see that she is there, not for your well being, but to play at being \"mommy' again. She's not even gone yet and already making plans to return. You are a new mom and have barely had time to hold your own child. This has to be stopped. Sit down with your hubby and let him know how distressed you are at MIL taking over and being left out of your own life.

Your boundaries are important and it appears they overstep them frequently.  It also appears they decide to be involved at the worst possible times.

This is exactly right. \n\n\"Help\" is only helpful if it's actually helping... if it's just a disguise for attention-seeking, then it's more effort than it's worth, ESPECIALLY with a new tiny baby to worry about. \n\nNTA at all. Your MIL is insecure and projecting. Those are things SHE'LL need to work on... they're not your responsibility to fix.", "NTA, she sounds like a steamroller. Rest up, and congratulations on the baby.", "Your MIL is suffering from Main Character Syndrome.  You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA! Repeatedly NTA!\n\nPeople who don\u2019t listen to others about their health are a pet peeve. 15 years of being told \u201cit\u2019s just period pain and you\u2019re sensitive\u201d when it was endometriosis and adenomyosis will do that. Your MIL is wild, like I don\u2019t have any other word than wild. Why is your baby in her room at night?!? \n\nAn example of how this would work in a normal world: When my eldest sibling was born, my dad\u2019s mum (Granny) came to stay and help. My mum and Granny got on incredibly well, but she was a retired midwife and took over completely. My mum got upset, told my dad, and he had a kind conversation with Granny who then backed off. And that\u2019s with my dad being the most conflict avoidant man I know and my Granny being a very formidable woman!\n\nYour husband needs to have your back! What time are you, him and the baby getting to bond as a family? What support is he giving YOU with the hormonal changes, the physical recovery from a c-section, the emotional responses that might be having given the grief of losing a child previously? Why is this even remotely about the MIL?!? Also WHO ENTERS A HOSPITAL ROOM WITHOUT KNOCKING FIL????\n\nCongratulations OP, enjoy this time with your child and tell your husband to grow a backbone and stand up to his mother. Have a wee snuggle with your baby and enjoy it instead of worrying about her", "People come to help look after YOU not the baby. The baby is your responsibility and they help look after you, they cook and clean and make it easier for YOU to bind with baby, not them! WTF are you doing letting baby sleep in her room?

Are you happy with that?\n\nYour partner needs to step up here and support you. Not pander to his mother.", "no", "NTA and you've got a husband problem.  He should be stepping up and reining his family in.", "NTA and your husband need to have your back and shut his mother down. He needs to make sure you're cared for, and you aren't being attacked by his parents.", "Not enough people say that imo \"run them out of town\" its a good quote", "...on a rail.", "I completely agree. Like I said, I thought everything was fine (she was being helpful, things seemed to be going well) and then I overheard her complaining and it was so much drama. Husband asked me to be accomodating because she's not at a great place in her life (about to get fired from her job, ironically due to not following directions from her boss + she and FIL just went through a messy divorce) but I feel like those things are not my problem and if anything, show the need to be firm in having structure and boundaries with her . . .", "Thanks! Unfortunately my mom passed away a few years ago - my dad is coming in a couple of weeks but we let his family come out first because they could only get Thanksgiving week off.", "Thanks. :) I don't know what the hospital policy was - I literally heard someone say \"you have a visitor\" and then FIL walked into the room. I had someone else visit a couple of days later and they were wearing a visitor badge but were able to just knock on our room's door, so maybe this hospital makes people register but does not make them wait in a waiting room?", "Thanks, I completely agree. They just stomp all over my boundaries and my husband keeps asking me to be the one who accomodates them . . .", "Thanks. :) Yeah after I heard her complaining I realized she was not here to support me, but purely for the baby . . . same with FIL who came to the hospital without even checking that it was ok.", "Thanks, I agree. There's already rumblings about either MIL or FIL coming out for XMas so I need to figure out how I am going to deal with that and what boundaries I want to set. The frustrating thing is that none of them offered to help out during my pregnancy (which was very high risk due to what happened last time) but now that the baby is here everyone wants to be here.", "Thank you!", "Quite frankly, it is not your job to give a flying duck about her personal problems. Please for the love of God, yourself, and your infant take care of yourself and quit worrying about this woman\u2019s feelings.", "This also shows the need for the husband to have your back and handle his parents. She's going through a hard time? You just had your body ripped open to bring a child into the world, HIS child. To solve the in-law problem you need to solve the husband problem.", "I'm sorry but your husband needs to remove his head from his ass and support the person who was just cut open and had a whole ass person removed.

Is your husband doing some of the night/am feedings so you can take turns getting sleep? The quicker you both create your routine (without mil\u2019s interference) for taking care of the baby, the better.\nHelp is what you ask for assistance with, not what she thinks is best or a better idea.", "Thanks. I completely agree, I hadn't been overly concerned about her feelings before this but I feel like his family gaslights me with their complaints.", "My husband says she's not in a good place in her life (she's about to get fired from her job, ironically for doing what she wants instead of following directions from her boss, so this is a consistent pattern of behavior for her) and to try to be accomodating towards her because of that.\n\nI'm honestly not sure how I feel about the baby sleeping in her room. I did get more sleep last night by having my husband bring the baby to me to feed every three hours, then having him or MIL burp, change and get the baby back to sleep . . . I think we will do it for one more night and then SIL is coming into town and MIL can go stay with her in her Airbnb. I had asked his family to spread out their visits instead of coming all at once, but that boundary wasn't respected either.", "Have your husband read the lemon clot essay. That should sum up why his mother\u2019s feelings are FAR less important than your recovery. Congratulations on your little one!"]}
