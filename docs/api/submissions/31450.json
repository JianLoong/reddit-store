{"id": 31450, "submission_id": "180q0dg", "title": "AITA for not being more accomodating towards my MIL?", "selftext": "My husband and I (both in our 30s) have been together for 5 years, married for 2. Overall, our relationship is good but we've had consistent issues with his family complaining that I'm cold, I don't want to spend time with them, I don't want to be a part of their family, etc. On my end, I feel like a lot of it has to do with them consistently not respecting my boundaries, especially when there have been health / pregnancy issues involved. \n\nFor example: \n\n1. The first time I flew to visit them I caught a bad cold and they were upset that I stayed at the house one day instead of making a three-hour drive with them to meet their cousin, eat at a Polish buffet and go for a hike in the rain. \n2. Last year MIL came to visit while I was pregnant, and even though I wasn't feeling well she wanted to do a lot of activities in the heat (farmer's market, go rowing on the lake, etc.) and she pressured me into accompanying her on a lot of these outings. Well, it turned out that I was suffering from severe preeclampsia which was undiagosed - two weeks later I had to have an emergency c-section and we lost the baby in the third trimester. She flew out (without being asked) and then told anyone who would listen that she knew something was wrong because of how tired I was. (I want to note that I don't blame her for the stillbirth - I'm just giving an example of her not respecting my boundaries when I wasn't feeling well and then pretending that didn't happen). \n3. This year we got pregnant again and FIL was in town when I delivered the baby last week. Despite us telling FIL that we would let him know when it was ok for him to visit, he came to the hospital without asking - three hours after I had a c-section he walked into the room with no warning while I was puking and topless (had been trying to nurse). He apologized and ended up coming back the next day but for me the damage was already done and I was really upset. \n\nNow MIL is staying with us for a week to help take care of the baby. I thought things were going fine, then last night (less than 48 hours after she arrived) I was trying to nap and overheard her complaining to my husband that she's going to go home early, she feels like we don't need her, she's not spending enough time with the baby, I'm mad at her (I wasn't), etc. etc. Basically it was all about her and my husband has been asking me to be more accomodating towards her (spend more time talking with her instead of in the bedroom, etc.) \n\nAnd I said no. I've been polite, I've made small talk with her, I've thanked her for her help, the baby now sleeps in her room at night per her request. She and FIL were the first ones to spend time with the baby, even ahead of my own family. But I am not going to spend my time and energy worrying about her feelings when I am one week postpartum and my focus should be on healing and on my baby. AITA for saying I am done trying to accomodate my MIL?

Sit down with your hubby and let him know how distressed you are at MIL taking over and being left out of your own life.

Your MIL is wild, like I don\u2019t have any other word than wild.

My mum and Granny got on incredibly well, but she was a retired midwife and took over completely. My mum got upset, told my dad, and he had a kind conversation with Granny who then backed off.

Why is this even remotely about the MIL?!?

Unfortunately my mom passed away a few years ago - my dad is coming in a couple of weeks but we let his family come out first because they could only get Thanksgiving week off.", "Thanks. :) I don't know what the hospital policy was - I literally heard someone say \"you have a visitor\" and then FIL walked into the room. I had someone else visit a couple of days later and they were wearing a visitor badge but were able to just knock on our room's door, so maybe this hospital makes people register but does not make them wait in a waiting room?", "Thanks, I completely agree.

There's already rumblings about either MIL or FIL coming out for XMas so I need to figure out how I am going to deal with that and what boundaries I want to set.

I did get more sleep last night by having my husband bring the baby to me to feed every three hours, then having him or MIL burp, change and get the baby back to sleep . . . I think we will do it for one more night and then SIL is coming into town and MIL can go stay with her in her Airbnb.

OP, you need to make it CLEAR to your husband that YOU and the baby are priority from here on our, NOT your parents.
