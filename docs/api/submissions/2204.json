Instead, he is a manipulative pathological liar with no remorse.", "NTA\n\nI would have sent a mass mail with a detailed explanation what a pitiful beguiler he actually is.", "NTA. He obviously wants to be seen as the hero of the family. Can't stand that his baby sister, who is a single mom (gasp! The horror! s/), is doing better than he is.", "NTA\n\nWas what he claims ever true? If so that would make it at least somewhat understandable (but he still needs to stop), but if not, this is really bizarre behavior.", "What (if anything) does he pay for when it comes to you and your child?\n\nHelping and supporting mean two different things to me. Is either true or partially true?", "NTA, it's weird he is trying to claim he is supporting you when he isn't.  Even if he was that should be a private thing not something to be boasted about.  Tell him to stop and that every time he does this again you will publicly correct the record.", "NTA and WTF", "NTA. You can't claim to support someone financially that doesn't need financial support. If you infact provide for yourself, your child, & your parents then your brother has nothing to boast about. If he's looking to boost his ego then he can make his own family that he can support. I'd make sure he wasn't actually giving your parents financial support on the sly though.", "NTA but milk it!

I can't help but wonder if it's not only that he wants to make himself look generous and noble, but also that it's important to him to make you look \"weak\" or \"dependent.\"\n\nI think you should continue to force the issue. If he says something again, ask him what support he is talking about. What did he pay for? How much money is he saying he gave you? Where are the receipts? Why is he saying this if it isn't true?\n\nAlternatively, is he married? Maybe his spouse sees extra money leaving their accounts and he made up this lie to cover for it.
