Could he think he's supporting you because he's under the assumption your parents help you using money he gives them?

He clearly has major issues.", "NTA. Wth is he talking about? *Is* there some way in which he's helping you guys out financially or did he just randomly decide to lie to everyone about this.

There's paying for someone's house and monthly bills, versus once a while buying them lunch.", "How often does he buy groceries for you, and how much does he spend?

Which goal (hero or victim) he has depends on who he is telling it too.  It makes him sound successful and rich to ones he wants to impress.  To the others he wants them to feel sorry for him so he plays the victim with the bonus of making them dislike his family.   If they dislike his family they won't talk with them and find out what a lying fraud he is.  Funny thing about it, his parents have bailed him out time and time again.  Even paid for his divorce.  Never once has he helped them out with money and has screwed them over a number of times.", "When he starts in again about how he is financially supporting you, you can say \"thanks I did appreciate the $40/month grocery money you  used to give me when I was strapped for cash,\" or something like that to make it clear that \n\nA.
