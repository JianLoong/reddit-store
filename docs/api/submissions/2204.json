Your brother weird.", "NTA. He is throwing you under the bus to feel like a great generous person. Instead, he is a manipulative pathological liar with no remorse.", "NTA\n\nI would have sent a mass mail with a detailed explanation what a pitiful beguiler he actually is.", "NTA.

The horror! s/), is doing better than he is.", "NTA\n\nWas what he claims ever true?

You can't claim to support someone financially that doesn't need financial support. If you infact provide for yourself, your child, & your parents then your brother has nothing to boast about. If he's looking to boost his ego then he can make his own family that he can support. I'd make sure he wasn't actually giving your parents financial support on the sly though.", "NTA but milk it!

I know people like this. They want to be the hero to everyone. Call them out often.", "NTA\nFrom now on, correct him whenever he says this, loudly", "NTA.  I can't help but wonder if it's not only that he wants to make himself look generous and noble, but also that it's important to him to make you look \"weak\" or \"dependent.\"\n\nI think you should continue to force the issue. If he says something again, ask him what support he is talking about. What did he pay for? How much money is he saying he gave you? Where are the receipts? Why is he saying this if it isn't true?\n\nAlternatively, is he married? Maybe his spouse sees extra money leaving their accounts and he made up this lie to cover for it. Maybe he's got an extra family on the side. I'm 100% reaching here, but it at least gives a reason for his bullshit, even if it's a bad reason.", "Send your brother the bills for the next month to pay for. \nLet him live up to his words. \n\nBetter yet, send the bills in the family chat, saying \"Thanks brother!\"", "Yes", "Yep!  And on fb I would:  hey just want everyone to know I run a successful business and am happily helping my parents financially.  If you\u2019ve heard otherwise, it\u2019s untrue!", "He did help sometimes with small things but never like financially supported", "Nothing. Sometimes can give as small gifts that\u2019s all.

And question everything", "That\u2019s funny but pointless since he won\u2019t pay it. For sure", "NTA next time he brags about helping you and folks out, just look at him with a raised eyebrow and say \"You don't even help take out the trash.\"", "NTA. Is he at least helping with practical things like babysitting, diy, running errands, buying things you need...? If no I would ask him how exactly he thinks he is helping... If he says financially, ask him to tell you when it was the last time he did that for either yourself or your parents. Make sure to tell him that he seems to be belittling your own hard work and kindness to your parents, and how hurtful it is when you are working so hard to provide a good life to your child.", "NTA\nMy mother did this for years!!! Drove me nuts. I started asking people, well, if she's supporting me, why am I working? Most of the people were her family, so I didn't really care. But random people in the grocery store, or at my job. My job, yes she'd act like she did everything for me while not doing anything. I finally just gave up amd let her have the fake validation she wanted.\n\nHowever, when my kid got older, it was more visible. I was the one showing up for things, working at school events, being there for my child, so my friends heard her words but saw my actions.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t definitely use this to my advantage and get him to commit to buying you something expensive next time he does this in front of someone!", "NTA - But... is there any chance he's helping your parents but they're using YOU as an excuse to get more money? I have friends who do this when they're asking me for money and when I confront them, they magically don't wanna talk anymore.", "NTA..what's his reasoning for telling people this? Make him put his money where his mouth is. If he says he is supporting you, tell him you need X amount of $ for this months bills.", "NTA. But it's time to PUBLICLY call him on this shit. INFRONT of all his friends/family so there is NO misunderstanding. And continue doing so as long as he wishes to mouth off. People jump to all kinds of conclusions, and there's no telling what they might try if they think it's a bad situation for the kid, reddit readily encourages people to report things, especially suspected cases of any kind of abuse (as we should, abuse shouldn't be tolerated).", "NTA\n\nBut I'd ask him to actually see some of the cash and/or help as it hasn't been visible so far.", "NTA\nMy brother (50)did this. Moved in with my mom,(83)  called it his house was giving my mom money then made her refinance house and give him back money he paid in.. well he's paid over 30K she says.  I told her to consider it rent and landlords don't rebate rent.....", "NTA. \n\nIs it possible that your parents could be telling him that they give you money? Could he think he's supporting you because he's under the assumption your parents help you using money he gives them? Sadly, it's not uncommon for parents who get financial help to cause drama like this because they either want more money for themselves or feel embarrassed about not being able to take care of themselves, so they use an excuse of being unable because someone else is dependent.", "Ngl that is some weird stuff. As someone already  he has no right to embarrass you. NTA", "NTA.  Out of curiosity, is he married and his spouse thinks he's financially supporting you?", "NTA.\n\nSo he's lying to everyone around you to make himself look good? And he wants you, the person who is actually supporting your family, to just go along with this?\n\nThat is just pitiful. He needs to get his ego in check and stop trying to benefit from the hard work of others. I'd be interested to know what your parents think of this.\n\nI would absolutely out his lies to everyone. Tell him if he wants the credit, he has to do the work.", "Nta. He\u2019s trying to look good without doing any work. He should put those words into action and give you some money", "Wtf. How did this even start without being immediately corrected?! What a deeply deeply odd thing to do, and also to just go along with without correcting him. I mean, I think ESH for you all just passively going along with him telling massive lies that make you all look so bad. Just tell everyone he\u2019s lying!", "Nta but stop giving money to your parents you are a single mother.", "NTA", "I really like the idea of sending an invoice every time he says it.", "Better send a cease or desist letter from a lawyer  informing  him that you will sue for x amount  /month  (however much you spend ) if he doesn't  stop and will use the people  he's telling  this in court  for witnesses \ud83d\ude09 nta", "He doesn\u2019t", "We don\u2019t leave together", "Thank you very much for the second part of your message and regarding the first part: he buy groceries for me, (something what we need for 1 day) once a month or more rare", "Idk but when we had that big fight my\nMom supported him and said i should be ashamed to talk like that.

He doesn't help you financially but lies and says he does. Why do you care if a delusional person thinks you're a b\\*tch?\n\nAlso, unless I misunderstood, you wrote that you asked him to stop.  Don't ask him. Just correct him decisively in front of his friends, family, etc whenever he brings it up.  Correct him in a calm voice, don't let him pull you into an argument or name-calling.  His insults and unhinged reaction will speak volumes on its own.", "This. And if you\u2019re with any of your mutual friends and family and they say something that implies that he\u2019s supporting you, look at them like they have two heads and say \u2018you know *brother\u2019s name* does not and has never supported me financially right? I have no idea why he keeps telling people this. I have my own business and am doing quite well for myself, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m even in a position to even need his support. I\u2019ve asked him repeatedly to stop telling this lie to people but he keeps doing it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him\u2019."]}
