The person who is lying to everyone about how providing financial support to people that he does not actually support is TA here. You have no need to sugarcoat calling him out as a liar.", "Why is he telling people that? Is there more context?", "Is your brother in therapy?  He sounds like he has a poor self-image.", "NTA. He\u2019s threatened by his little sister\u2019s success. \n\nGrow TF up and figure your life out brother.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to call out his lies.", "NTA.  He's lying to make himself look good.  Call him out on it every single time he says it.", "NTA, you are morally in the right to very publicly disagree with him every time he says that, and should encourage your parents to do so as well, and 80% that's more than just social bragging to make himself look good, more like fraught.", "Not enough information.... sounds like you left the context of why he's saying this... sounds like there's more to the situation than what you've shared.", "NTA. OP, I would post on social media, \"I am so proud of my business and my ability to support myself, my child, and some family members based on my hard work. It's really unfortunate that I have one family member that seems to be spreading a narrative that he's helping to support me. He has not. He has not paid a single bill for me. And no matter how much I tell him to stop spreading this lie, he will not, so I want to clear the air here.\"\n\nOP, I BET this is a bigger lie than you think. I bet he bums money off of people and claims he can't pay them back because he's helping you, etc., and people feel bad and believe him. Clear the air. You tried to handle it directly with him. Try a different route.", "Exactly, OP just needs to start sending all her bills and that of her parents to the brother henceforth. Let's see how well he leaves up to it", "You wrote that you asked him to stop. Don't ask him. Just correct him decisively in front of his friends, family, etc whenever he brings it up. Correct him in a calm voice, don't let him pull you into an argument or name-calling. His insults and unhinged reaction will speak volumes on its own.", "This is the way.", "[removed]", "So what\u2019s the grift? To be that invested in his lie, what\u2019s he getting out of it apart from the illusion that\u2019s he\u2019s a saint?", "Next time your mom brings it up, as you being the bad guy, tell her then you don't need to help her anymore since your brother apparently is helping her. She will backpedal so fast. If she doesn't, then let her flail. Some people won't learn unless there are consequences to their bs. I would also distance myself from someone who is disparaging you for their benefit.", "Why are these people in your life at all?", "A better one would be \"you do!?! When? With what exactly!\"", "I\u2019m not the OP\u2026", "u/VastAppointmen stole [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu21qo/comment/iw7wbez/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from u/YourMomsQueefs\n\nDownvote and Report > Spam > Harmful bots", "It was a bot", "appreciate it!", "What exactly are you supposed to be appreciating?  The help he's not giving you, that you don't need?", "Geeze. Why are the parents enabling it? Yikes.", "They aren't anymore."]}
