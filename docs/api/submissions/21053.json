{"id": 21053, "submission_id": "14nv5m2", "title": "AITA for telling my roommate that my GF isn't interested?", "selftext": "This is going to sound weird and I get that. I have a roommate (43mtf) that has been a family friend for like 20 years. Her daughter is actually my (27m) best friend. 2 years ago I met my GF at a convenience store while she was working. I know that seems weird too but we have been inseparable from the day we met. She's everything to me. We started making plans of moving in together because her lease went up last month but mine doesn't go up for another 6 months. My roommate said \"why don't you just have her move in here?\" So, I did. She moved in officially 3 weeks ago and things have been great, outside of my roommate making her uncomfortable. \n\nSo my roommate is an early riser (between 4-5am) and things started small. I leave for work at 5:30am. My GF owns her own business and generally sleeps in and starts her day around 9. Well, I guess she's been waking up in the morning to my roommate knocking on the door around 8 with coffee and breakfast for her. Something my roommate has never done for anyone that I know (including her own daughter). And then she will sit on the edge of the bed and immediately engage my GF in conversation and I guess not leave her alone at all. Like following her throughout the house. \n\nMy GF only started bringing it to my attention when my roommate started standing directly in front of her when she's at the table, which essentially blocks her from moving at all because our kitchen is stupid small. My GF is severely claustrophobic. I installed live cameras to see what was going on and I physically witnessed my roommate standing not even 6 inches away from my GF when she was sitting at the table and everytime my GF would try to get up to move, my roommate would barely step out of the way. To a point where they would have to touch for her to move. And she's been talking a lot about her bedroom life with the GF she claims she has but no one's met. So I went home immediately (left work early) and when I walked in, my GF had locked herself in the bedroom (barred it) and I told my roommate that my GF wasn't interested and to leave her alone. She denies anything so I showed the cameras and that's when she doubled down and said I was overreacting and that obviously having my GF here was causing problems because she's \"just being friendly\".

Move out with your gf to protect her from the creepy roommate.", "NTA - your roommate either has a crush on your GF or seriously has no idea about boundaries or reading body language.  But your GF needs to speak up and make sure your roommate knows what is acceptable behavior between them.", "NTA\n\nThis feels creepy. I think you might want to start looking for a new place immediately. I doubt GF will ever be able to feel safe around your roommate again even if they keep their distance from now on.\n\n(I do dislike that you put up camera's if roommate did not know about it, especially if it is in the shared area of the house)", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately (and I say this as gently and kindly as possible, as someone who has struggle with gender dysphoria my whole life and who has nothing but love and understanding for the challenges of being trans), your roommate seems to be dealing with two very common issues that trans women sometimes struggle with inadvertently (and often without even realising it), that can cause some issues with people around them, both related to the fact that they ARE real women, but they (sadly) weren't raised and socialised as women, and so are \"learning as they go\" once they transition:\n\nThe first is that they sometimes have an idealised view of the female experience, because (much like those of us who are autistic and don't just naturally become socialised through lived experience), they've learned what they know about womanhood (not BEING A WOMAN, which they inherently are, but how women relate to each other socially) from the outside...movies, TV, books, etc. It seems like maybe your roommate very much wants to be girlfriends (in the platonic sense) with your GF, which is incredibly sweet . . . but she's being a bit ham-handed about it because she only knows how \"girlfriends\" relate to each other from what she's seen in movies, TV, etc. She's doing her best to be a great bestie . . . showing up with breakfast and coffee in the morning, eager to have girl talk, etc. . . .but it's coming across as WAY too much because what she's doing is forcing an artificial closeness that in reality you can't push that way. it just freaks people out. \n\nWomen don't actually become besties who sit on each other's beds and share talk about their relationships that fast. That's the kind of friendship that happens after YEARS. It is appropriate for you to sit your roommate down and gently say to her that you love that she wants to be close friends with your GF, but that she's coming on kind of strong, and that you think she needs to take like five steps back and let the friendship grow naturally. I would NOT mention the \"this is not how women become besties\" part. It will hurt her terribly. I'm just contextualising it for you, so you understand that I don't think she's trying to stomp boundaries . . . I think she's still learning her way around female friendships. Making girlfriends is not the same as having a daughter. I think she's just trying too hard. Help her try a little less hard.\n\nSimilarly, and again sadly, a lot of trans women (and seriously this breaks my heart), despite the fact that they struggled terribly with their own bodies growing up, because they were socialised as boys/men, they are used to being encouraged to TAKE UP SPACE with their bodies in the world, without thinking twice about it. This is the opposite of how women are socialised. This also means that even after transition, some trans women can inadvertently use their bodies in very male ways without meaning to . . . taking up space in ways that feel aggressive to cis women, NOT because they intend to be aggressive or stand too close, or be intimidating, but because that's literally how the world encouraged them to be their whole lives pre-transition. DO NOT talk about this as \"you're acting like a guy\". Rather, it is okay to gently point out the behaviour itself (\"I adore you, but you have a tendency to kind of stand in people's personal bubbles . . . I think GF would be more comfortable if you gave her a bit of space\") without making it about gender. It isn't her fault, but it is her responsibility to be aware that she is making someone uncomfortable, and to change that.\n\nYou are NTA, and she needs to back off, but I hope this gives you some much-needed context that she probably isn't being a creep, just still learning things that most cis women are taught or socialised into early on.", "NTA\n\n> Well, I guess she's been waking up in the morning to my roommate knocking on the door around 8 with coffee and breakfast for her\n\nI mean... great, breakfast in bed but WTF?\n\nYour roommate is harrassing your gf. Some of these actions could be technically considered assault and you have video evidence. \n\n\"just being friendly\", where have I heard that before?", "NTA and your roommate is harasser. You'd have to separate either by moving out or having her to leave the apartment. This will probably affect your friendship with her daughter, so prepare.", "NTA.  \nYour roommate is behaving in a manner that is completely inappropriate and physically intimidating. You all need to have a sit-down meeting, lay down some very very clear boundaries, and simultaneously prepare to either (a) boot out the roommate, or (b) plan to move out yourselves.\n\nStay safe OP. This smells weird.", "LOL NTA your roommate is being weird and clearly has boundary issues you and you GF should start looking for a new place to move to", "NTA. regardless if roommate is interested or not, waking an acquaintance up to force them to talk and have breakfast is psychotic behavior", "NTA 100%. From what you've written its clear that your roommate has a crush/interest on your GF. The fact that she became defensive and blamed your GF when you talked to her, says a lot.\nIn the end it doesnt matter if she has a crush or she's just \"too friendly\".  The fact that your GF feels so uncomfortable that she locks herself in her room when your not at home should be enough to let your roommate know that her attitude is not welcome and she should stop.\n\nSo you have two options:\n1- Sit down with your roommate to talk again about everything and set clear boundaries (if you are all willing to resolve this situation)\n2- Start looking for a new apartment together with your girlfriend\n\nI can understand that you have a 20 years friendship with your roommate and it's a difficult situation, but are you willing to lose your relationship with your GF over this?\nBecause if she hasn't already, it's only a matter of time before she herself asks you to move elsewhere.", "NTA. No explanation needed.", "NTA. Your roommate's behavior is weird as hell. I find myself wondering if she's trying to drive your GF away because she got comfortable with *you* as her roommate and doesn't want to disrupt things. \n\nBut honestly, the why of it is not so important. The behavior is inappropriate and it's *really* troubling that your roommate thinks she did nothing wrong.", "Sounds like one of those wolf in sheep\u2019s clothes situations. NTA", "NTA for wanting to look out for your gf. She deserves space and peace to work/relax, same as everyone. Being comfortable in her own home is paramount. \n\nPutting up cameras in a shared apartment, however, is a dick move. I get why you did it, but if I found out my roommate put a cam in our space that we both pay for, WITHOUT talking to me first, I would be *very unhappy*. Reasonable expectation of privacy in your own home. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if your roommate, who you mentioned is trans, is just happy to have another gal to chat with in the apartment? Maybe she\u2019s getting a little overexcited and not taking the hints. Even so, I\u2019m going with NTA for the aforementioned reasons as the roommate should be backing off now that you\u2019ve addressed it outright.", "Info:  Did you install the cameras with everyone's knowledge or surreptitiously?  That's the weirdest sentence I read in this post.\n\nDoes your roommate have a touch of Asperger's?
