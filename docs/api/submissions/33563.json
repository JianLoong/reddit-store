So it has been a while since I last saw my family of origin in person.\n\nMy mother (56F) called and asked to visit us for a few days before the holiday season. She said she really missed me and would love to see us all. So I happily accepted. However, we ran into quite a few problems while she was with us.\n\nFor one, she didn't knock on our kids' doors when she wanted to see them. (My wife and I always knock and wait for them to say come in. They also do that when they want to go into someone else's room. Which is why they were annoyed by my mom). I told her about this and she didn't pay much of an attention.\n\nSecond, I overheard mom asking our kids if they were treated differently at school, if they considered Laura or me as the fun mom, etc. I mostly brushed these off because they sounded quite innocent at the time.\n\nThird, Laura has an office at home that she uses whenever she has an urgent matter to take care of. She is very attached to that space of hers and doesn't let anyone go in there except for me. Even our kids know better. I caught my mom coming out of that room a few times and warned her. \n\nThe last straw was when I came home early to take mom out for lunch and found her going through drawers in our bedroom. It is a very private space as you know and I could not comprehend the reason behind this. Also, there are a whole bunch of handwritten notes, personal belongings, etc that my mom has no business with.\n\nSo I got really mad and asked her what she was looking for. She didn't give me a coherent answer and said she was looking for a toy my daughter lost and she thought maybe she hid it here somewhere. For the rest of her visit (2 days) I didn't talk to her much. I asked Laura to make plans with the kids so my mom couldn't hang out with them much.\n\nWhen she was leaving. I told my mom not to visit us again.

She violated your trust by searching through your private things. She refused to follow basic rules like knocking on doors. She's shown herself to be someone you don't want in your home again.\n\nI'd expect rose colored glasses from her husband. If your brother lives separately, has he never caught her going through his things?", "NTA.  The snooping through the drawers thing would have been an immediate ejection for me.", "NTA. You do not ever need to play host to someone who crosses your boundaries. I would have kicked her out after the second or third time warning her not to violate the kids' boundaries, or after she went through the drawers (my guess is that she's looking for sex toys, but WTF is up with her?) I'd also keep contact pretty low until she can make it clear that she is working to reestablish trust with you, or cut her out entirely. She clearly does not have respect for your family's boundaries.", "NTA \n\nShe disrespected the most simple of rules that your household has: knock on closed doors and stay out of private spaces. AND you caught her rifling through drawers? \n\nSorry, but she lost visiting privileges for being a snoop. \n\nFWIW I have no idea why some people have no respect for children and their privacy. They think it\u2019s okay just to barge into bedrooms. Doesn\u2019t matter if the kids are 2 or 22 \u2014 knock!", "NTA. I mean, of course. Your mother was an inappropriate and ungrateful guest, who showed you and your family tremendous disrespect by disregarding your explicitly stated rules.", "NTA\nShe was a crappy guest. She was investigating your household nothing she did was innocent. You haven't had a relationship with her for years, I don't think you'll suffer much if you continue not to have one. You don't owe her any involvement in your life or your children's lives. I don't know how you didn't kick her out earlier. Your father and brother can suck it up.", "NTA. I could probably handle the disrespectful guest for the short term, but snooping through drawers is a deal breaker.", "NTA.  Overlooking one or two small things would be understandable, but that's a lot of disrespectful,  rude, intrusive behavior with a lot of excuses but no remorse until she got a consequence. You have no reason to believe that in the future, she would understand how to respect your extremely reasonable and appropriate boundaries in your own home.  Your mom can visit you in the future but just not stay in your home.", "NTA.  Send your brother and father this very list of what actually occurred.  (That last one is a doozy.) There is no reason on the face of this earth that she should be going through your bedroom.   That is just no.   Detail out the reasons why she is not invited back to your house, and hold your boundary.    She was wrong.  Period.  This was an appropriate response to her being very inappropriate.", "NTA, she needs to learn to act like a human being.", "Your house, your rules.

NTA!!!  \nShe spent every chance she had snooping through the private areas of your home. That may not be \"heartless\" but it's pretty monstrous behavior.   \nI wouldn't want her back, either.  \n\n\nThis is your business but why are a 5 y.o. and a 6 y.o. in rooms with the door closed? I understand teaching them to respect closed doors and to knock before entering but kids that age shouldn't be that far out of sight and hearing.", "NTA but it wasn't really necessary to say at that time. You could have just declined any future request to visit. She's always been someone who doesn't take responsibility for her poor behavior, so all she would do is make herself the victim.", "NTA.  You made a few simple requests of her that she kept not respecting. She didn't respect the office she had no business in, and she seriously disrespected your personal space and business going into your bedroom to snoop.  A toy she might have hidden?  Why would she be hiding anything in your bedroom at all?  Her excuses are lame and you need to set Dad and brother straight on what all she did that was crossing the line.  Or not.  You don't have to talk to them if you don't want to.", "NTA, but something about this story doesn\u2019t add up to a normal visit from a boundary-stomping mom. These incidents point in one direction: it sounds like your mother was investigating you and your wife. It fits all the incidents you mentioned.\n\n* Barging into the kids\u2019 rooms so they can\u2019t hide what they are doing.\n* Questioning them about their relationships with their moms and whether they are treated differently at school.\n* Snooping i nyour wife\u2019s office multiple times. You don\u2019t mention what her work is, but I assume that an office would at least have financial records in it and possibly sensitive information about other people. If you are suspicious, a room that\u2019s off limits would be the very place you would want to look.\n* Searching through your drawers also fits the profile because that\u2019s where a lot of people would hide things. That could be anything from love letters to sex toys to drugs.\n\nTake an inventory, as best you can, and try to figure out what if anything might be missing. I think your mother is about to cause a problem for you and your wife. There\u2019s no telling about what. My guess would be that you might get a visit from CPS if she\u2019s thinking of taking your kids away from a household of two women. I may be wrong, and I hope I am, but this is not normal behavior.", "I would have taken her to a hotel and cut the trip short.  You\u2019re a saint for waiting until she was leaving to tell her off", "What an invasive creep. Mom like everyone has to be an considerate guest, and reasonable house rules like your apply to her.  Send you family a list of shot she did and ask them if that would be cool in their house?", "NTA, the lost toy should not be believed, was probably looking for cash hidden away, surprised that she was not helped out to the street right away....", "NTA\n\nShe disrespects everything regarding you and your family.", "NTA. I stayed in my daughter and her wife\u2019s home while they were in hospital having their first baby. I cannot imagine going through their drawers like that. The worst invasion of privacy I did was wash their laundry. They had a lot (daughter was very ill during pregnancy and dil was working a lot) and I just couldn\u2019t not do it \ud83d\ude02 I washed, folded and left on the bed for DIL to put away bc I didn\u2019t want to go into their drawers.", "I came here to say the same thing."]}
