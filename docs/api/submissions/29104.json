You both have vastly different financial values. You need marital counseling to learn how to deal with such drastic differences if you want your marriage to last. Otherwise you will be making a lifetime of sacrifices to accommodate his spending. For now you need to maintain separate finances and hold off having any children until you figure this out.", "Nta he is financially irresponsible. You should try to help him on that if you can.", "NTA, but for the love of god, why are so many people married without ever having talks about finances???? It\u2019s a major reason for divorce and it just doesn\u2019t make sense that something so important isn\u2019t discussed and planned out prior to marriage. Do not get a joint account with your husband. He has no financial competence.", "NAH - if he\u2019s handling his debt how he wants to, then that\u2019s his choice and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s even talked to you about this. \n\nAlso, in a comment you mentioned you haven\u2019t really discussed your finances. That\u2019s kind of something you should do if you\u2019re trying to build a life together.", "NTA. Definitely prioritize your own debt for now. Ignore everyone that says you should divorce him over his 7k debt, that isn\u2019t horrible in the scheme of things.", "NTA \n\nSounds like he needs to focus on lowering his debt.", "NTA \n\nHe better spend more on debt then fun", "You are NTA, and please do not get a joint bank account. \n\nSome couples  with very different spending behaviour are just not made for joint finances. Although I'd generally argue that those couples are not made for marriage either. \n\nAs long as he is healthy functional adult - his debts are not your responsibility. Unless, he'd be covering any debts you might have, don't cover his. This is a two way street.", "Does hubby think you're an AH? Probably the only opinion on this one that counts.", "NTA.\n\nas long as he doesn't have good financial habits,  paying his debts is a bottomless pit. you'll pay his cards now, soon he'll be in debt again. don't do it.", "NTA and do not get a joint account.  So many people have bad experiences with that if one partner is shit with money\n\nIf he asks for help, give his budgeting advice.  Have a mutual incentive like a vacation or something to get debts down and save up money for something together.", "NTA. You aren't responsible for your Husband's inability to manage his Finances.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set some expectations here. He is being financially irresponsible. That 7k could easily become 14k plus.", "NTA but...you have a bigger problem. \n\nYou view his actions and yours as separate entities and yet, depending on where you live, his debt is your debt legally and/or you are both losing out on wealth building (and stress) months.  How do you get married and not discuss the #1 reason people divorce: money? Best to you!", "NTA. As much as I like joint finances, I think it's fair that he gets his money-managing skills in order first, you both become responsible for it.", "NTA. Not your debt, not your problem.", "Financial compatibility is one of those things that often gets overlooked - it's pretty important for relationship health over the long term. Sometimes differences compliment each other, sometimes it drives a wedge.  Good luck.\n\nNTA here - it sounds like he got into debt before you were married, it's a good chance for him to learn to manage money and get out (but he has to LEARN, otherwise it just happens again). \n\nJust a side note (nothing to do with judgement here) - what's the finance rate on your car? I bought a couple years ago and am paying just 1.9%, which is considerably less than my savings account (4.25%). I have the money to pay it off, but I'm actually making more this way than paying it early.", "NTA, I agree, you pay your debts, these debt were built up before you got married, personally everything should have been payed off before you got married (not car). I think if you paid off his cards he would just build them back up again since he spends freely.", "You're NTA for it, but you're probably still legally responsible for half of it in case of a divorce, and it's going to ding you on shared credit checks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That being said, my bf and i just moved in together and for food, bills and household expenses we split amongst ourselves but anything like personal debts we take care of on our own, but if he needed money or i needed money we would offer it to the other. We dont share joint accounts yet either but we are both aware of how much we each earn, how much \"free\" money we each have and what our personal debts total to.", "NTA. But this is something you need to sit and talk about.  I feel like perhaps once you get your stuff paid off maybe y\u2019all can make a plan together to get his paid off quickly where you either tell him exactly what he needs to pay each month alone and hold him to it or you kick in x amount each month along with him where he is paying the bill but you are just giving a small assist.  Just so that way you are not at a bad spot where his debt is going to end up negatively effecting you, say if you start to look into purchasing a house.  He would have to be serious about it though. He\u2019d have to hit the payment you told him he had to hit every month and not charge anything else at all.   The effort from him would have to be there or no help at all from you.   Id also seriously consider telling him he needs to limit himself to one cc that has a low credit line. Say a thousand dollars.  That way he has something for emergencies but not something which will cause him to go into massive debt again as soon as the current debt paid off.   Some people can not handle large credit lines.   But all in all if you decide to not help him you would not be the asshole.", "NTA. However, the two of you should have talked about finances before getting married so that issues like this don\u2019t come up.", "NTA.  On the other hand, you should have some sort of agreement about how debt is handled.  In some places, now that you\u2019re married, you may become financially responsible for his future debt", "Nta.\n\nBeware, you two need to get on the same page regarding financial goals and spending budgets. It started small but the problem will get worse the longer you leave it. And the one who saves ends up paying for the one who spends, so it's best for you to fix this.\n\nYour finances aren't really separate if you are married. Because joint assets need to be purchased, joint expenses spent, joint collateral and loan applications for homes, etc. You now are dependent on each other, and your choices affect each other.", "NTA but be warnen to not get bend over in regards of  assets because he is irresponsible with money", "You are NTA for not helping your husband with his cc debt. Regardless if he accummulated these bills during or before marriage. If you are feeling generous though and would like to help him out a bit, then go for it! But, this isn't your responsibility. It is important that as life partners, you both discuss how to manage your finances. \n\nBTW, Congratulations on paying your car full by June! :)", "YTA, and financially illiterate. You and your husband owe (together since you are married) $7,000 on his credit cards and $13,000 on your car. You (plural) probably are paying a really high interest rate on the credit cards and a rate probably quite a bit less on the car. The extra $1,000 going toward your car should be going to pay off the credit cards so that you (plural) pay down the higher-interest debt first.\n\nYour approach is selfish and stupid.", "Info: why did you marry someone who lives this way?", "NTA\n\nSounds like he needs to learn to better manage his money.", "People tell me I should start a podcast with how I handle my money haha I think I\u2019m goin to work on something an see where we land. I want to see him succeed. And for myself at least it means so much more doing it on my own", "Oh definitely! My only bill is my car and she will be paid in full on or before June! God it will be nice not having to owe money on that lol and definitely not going anywhere thanks for your comment!", "I agree at least for the time being! Instead of joint accounts I\u2019d add him as beneficiary on everything in case anything happened to me so he would gets the money", "Wellllllll he doesn\u2019t exactly know how much money I have lol (not hiding it) he just never asked, I\u2019ve been paying my car down an saving for a house I\u2019m sure he would be conflicted", "This is a great idea! Thank you :)", "One of the main reasons I don\u2019t to join accounts with him he\u2019s one of the people that decide to use their debit card. Normally I am the special breed I do not swipe debit cards I only swipe credit cards so for him he has 1 million different things come out randomly and forget his balance me. I have a credit card payment that I know comes out because I am the one that submits it all at once", "Actually, depending on what OP lives, his debt may very well be her debt too. If not, minimally his strategy decimates the ability to growth wealth together.", "When I got mine the rates were blaaa I got 5% lmao right over what seems to be the savings rate at the moment hahaha", "Thank you!", "Oh we talked about these things before we got into this. I had just through the was doing more then the minimum payment \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s very aware of what credit card interest is now \ud83d\ude02", "Oh you best bet I looked into this comment debt states, and thankfully Connecticut isn\u2019t one of them lol", "Exactly I agree I\u2019m willing to put in the work!", "Thank you!! \ud83d\ude0a", "I appreciate that me and him had vastly different upbringings. His family was well off. I had to do everything on my own. If I could get this man to stay in a budget and stop going to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to control him boy being married, isn\u2019t as easy as I thought it was. \ud83d\ude02", "You guys never talk about money?", "LOL.  I like your answer.  NTA btw.\n\nI know very well how money can tear families and friendships apart. Trust,  love, respect... all gone for the value of a dollar.  \n\nSo I'd just worry how your differing values may impact your relationship one day.  You could start talking this through,  and coming to agreements about what is shared in the marriage and how much is on the individual. \n\nThat's the 'correct' advice.  But  I can't help feeling like you could always keep a bit aside he doesn't know about.   If something happened and he'd spent everything I can't see how you couldn't resent him for that.  And that outcome wouldn't be fair to either of you.", "Separate accounts sound like they might be the better choice then. Really, I think the more important thing is that you have a shared understanding/plan of the finances, as opposed to a shared account.", "I agre NTA but also agree you guys need to get on the same page, maybe not a hard fast budget but at least a general path.\n\nyou may not own his specific debt, but it will prevent /limit him from saving, which in turn will limit speed to achieve other shared financial goals", "But why, oh why, do you think it should be your job to get him stay in budget? is he a kid or something? I bet he isn't!  He is an adult, as are you. Both of you have the freedom of choices, but both should face the consequences of those choices.   \n\n\nHow will he learn if he never gets to face the consequences?", "> boy being married, isn\u2019t as easy as I thought it was\n\nNo, it's not.
