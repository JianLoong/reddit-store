{"id": 32516, "submission_id": "18cpqtv", "title": "AITA for letting my son eat the stew my stepdaughter prepared for her friends", "selftext": "I have been married to my wife for 5 months, living together for almost a year before marriage. My stepdaughter Ann (16f) used to split time between her parents but is currently with us full time as her father will be oversea until August. I also have a son, Leo (17m), who lives mostly with my ex-wife and with me on weekends. The kids go to different schools and have a decent relationship.\n\nMy wife and Ann are great cooks. My wife's parents came from another country and she and Ann regularly make exotic dishes from their homeland which are delicious. Both my son and I appreciate the dishes though we still have problems learning what is what.\n\nA few days ago Leo stopped by for something he left. Nobody was home so he let himself in. Leo said there was a big pot of stew on the stove and it smelled delicious and he asked if he could have some. My wife or Ann often made a huge batch of food when they cook, so it was nothing surprising. I told Leo to go ahead and just leave some for us. Now Leo is a wrestler and he eats a lot. A while later he sent me a photo, showing me how much stew was left in the pot. I could tell there was at least 5 servings left, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nAn hour later Ann called me, upset. She asked if I had eaten the stew she made. It was a special recipe from her grandma and she invited her friends over to try it. She said the stew was supposed to feed 9 people and she invited 6 friends but someone obviously had eaten almost half of her stew. I told her it was Leo and apologized, telling her she could order pizza for her friends and I would pay for it. Ann said it was poor compensation for her friends looking forward to her stew which she spent hours preparing but she did take my offer. When I later apologized and had Leo call to apologize himself, she said she accepted our apologies though she has been rather quiet around me.\n\nMy wife later told me I should not just allow Leo to eat whatever he wants in our kitchen as sometimes she and Ann have plans for their dishes. I think it's completely ridiculous that Leo is not allowed to eat things from his own father's kitchen and if my wife or Ann has a special plan for their food, they should put a note on it, otherwise, things in the kitchen should be up for grabs as the kitchen is a communal space for food and I pay for most of the groceries. I think if Leo is not allowed to have the food then it's like he's not part of the family. I am willing to talk to him about portion control but other than that I think he should be able to eat what he wants in the kitchen unless there's a note saying not to.

Leo didn't have a bowl of stew. He ate half of it. It was for a dinner with friends and there wasn't enough for the friends. You should get down off the cross and stop the \"not allowed to eat things from his own father's kitchen\" bullshit. When you cook, you get to decide what to do with the food. When someone else cooks, you need to find out if there are plans for the food before you start eating it or giving it away. That is just common courtesy.", "YTA\n\nYou were doing so well... right up until you said that your son should be able to eat whatever the hell he wants in your kitchen. If someone has made food, you ask the person who made it if you can have some. If you can't take the time to do that, or can't get in touch with them, make something else for yourself. There was likely a million other things your son could have eaten and it is completely unreasonable for you to just let him eat things that other people in your household cooked.\n\nThink about this... what if it had been a cake, and the cake was for her friend's birthday. Would you just let your son eat it because it's there and he wanted some? And would it be reasonable for him to eat half the cake as long as he left you each a slice? \n\nFrom now on, think of anything that's prepared as if it is a birthday cake. If you don't have permission, don't touch stuff that isn't yours.", "> they should put a note on it, otherwise, things in the kitchen should be up for grabs as the kitchen is a communal space for food and I pay for most of the groceries.\n\nWas putting a note on it a previous rule or did you just make that up to excuse your rudeness?  Do you do the meal plan for each week, deciding what to cook and how much to buy to serve all? Do you do all the grocery shopping? Do you cook every meal?  Did you cook this one?  Did you replace the ingredients so she can make it again, or ask what she wants to make next time?\n\nHe took HALF of a pot of food that you thought was meant for three staying there and turned out to be 5 portions worth! That\u2019s simply inconsiderate.\n\nYTA and you and your son have no manners.  Obviously prepared food that is still cooking is not up for grabs before the meal.  Of course, since you rarely cook, you clearly don\u2019t appreciate their effort.", "YTA and your wife is right. If you know its' left overs let him eat left overs. No, she cannot just order pizza, she was planning to share the stew. And that is quite thoughtless you would even suggest that. You should have just stuck with an appology and amitted your fault. Also it's not that Leo isn't allowed to have food, it's that Leo eating other peoples food is not respecting others. You said it yourselves he eats a lot so that is taking food from other peoples stomachs. IT's absolutely not that he's not allowed to eat from his fathers kitchen, it's again he should respect other peoples food. Leo did was right he asked, you should have said I'm sorry I don't know who's food that is I cannot give you permission. You should have told your son to just order pizza", "YTA\n\n1. You are the asshole because you allowed someone to eat something that was not yours.\n\n2. You are the asshole for not understanding why you are the asshole if you dont respect someones else property.\n\n3. Offering her to order pizza because you ruined her meal is extreme rude and it looks like you see Ann only as a cook and roommate and not as part of your family.\n\n\nAre you allowed to eat everything in your sons kitchen?", "YTA, especially because it was still cooking. Might be different if it was leftovers in the fridge, but that still depends on the system you set up as a family. Really not that hard to shoot a text to the family members who do a lot of the cooking when you decide you want tk eat it. Also the way you frame the kitchen as \"his own father's kitchen\" is just like clearly placing Ann as an outsider even though she's living with you fulltime. \n\nHeck, my husband often checks if he can have the last of a food he knows I like (and I often do the same for him) even though we both view our food as shared and would be incredibly unlikely to say no. But we want to share and respect if someone had plans for something rather than find excuses to not check in about food.", "YTA.\n\nYou can feed Leo anything you made. You can let Leo fix himself some food from what groceries you have available.\n\nYou don't get to simply decide that food somebody else fixed is available for him to eat. You ask the person who made it what the plans are for the food.\n\nAnd if you think your offer of pizza to make up for the anticipated soup made everything better, you're as smart as a box of rocks. \n\nIt's quite obvious that you don't think of your daughter as yours and so your son is allowed to do whatever he wants at her expense. jfc\n\nYTA.", "YTA. This \"aw-shucks I didn't know any better and *also* I buy all the food so isn't it all mine anyway and therefore my son's too\" look is NOT cute. So if it were still filled with raw meat and pretty obviously not completely done, but you or your son think it smells good so you're totally fine to just take it? Why is the onus on the person who made it to put a sign on a thing \"Hi. I made this for a certain occasion, please don't touch it\" and not you thinking  \"Hmm. I know my stepdaughter made it and I should ask her and wait to hear from her that its ready and / or okay for us to eat because she spent so long making it and I respect her\". Surely there were other things in the house that your son could have eaten. Maybe you should have ordered *him* a pizza.", "YTA\n\nAnd i\u2019m sorry for the long answer, but you really seem to have no clue as to why you could be.\n\n1. Not your decision to give away a stew that you did not make.\n2. You did not even TRY to reach out to your wife or stepdaughter to ask them if it was okay to have some of the stew. Would it have been so difficult? Why did you feel entitled to make that decision? Was it a meal time like dinner or lunch that you made the mistake of thinking it was for the 4 of you?\n3. I think it could still have been considered an honest mistake if only Leo had taken a normal-sized serving. But if you are planning to gobble up half the food, then it is plain rude to not ask the cook first, even if you thought it was made for a family meal and not any special usage. What etiquettes are you imparting by enabling such behaviour?\n4. What makes you a worse AH is the way you justify your mistake. Why bring up that you pay for all groceries? Are they not equal members of this family if they don\u2019t pay? Are they just slaves in your kitchen who do not have any ownership of the food they make because you paid for it? WTF is that attitude!\n5. Your offer to replace the stew with pizza is just so shitty. Firstly, it disrespects the effort Ann put into cooking the stew. Secondly, it shows your heartlessness because you fail to see the emotional labour and love she put into preparing a culturally significant dish for her friends. And lastly, it reeks of snobbish entitlement, plain and simple.\n6. Bottomline is, YOU made the mistake of making an uninformed assumption about a dish you found prepared or cooking on your stove. No one here is refusing you and your precious Leo any food from YOUR precious kitchen. In fact, your wife and Ann have shown immense patience and restraint here. But your solution to YOUR mistake (the post-it note system) puts the onus on the said wife and stepdaughter who are in fact the victims of your misjudgement. So a fairer solution would be to always check with the cook who made the food. I\u2019m guessing you or Leo would be typically the ones who would end up needing to ask. Well, start a group chat if that makes it easy. And if you don\u2019t get an immediate answer, order a pizza!\n7. Finally, I don\u2019t want to presume Leo\u2019s eating habits or shame him. So I will say just this - it doesn\u2019t matter how much he eats as long as it is healthy, and most importantly, as long as he is not ruining someone\u2019s plans for the food they made. So i guess the solution you work out as a family to avoid future mistakes like these, should take care of this problem.", "YTA you don\u2019t eat a gallon of soup that\u2019s not yours\u2014 regardless of what it\u2019s for? Good lord. Eat a sandwich or something that wasn\u2019t freshly prepared with a lot of time and effort. And if it was such a laborious preparation soup how did you not wander by and ask? What you making? Maybe \u201cwhat are your weekend plans?\u201d Or something of the sort. 9 girls are coming over and you noticed nothing? You and your son really need to think of others. lol half the soup and you think it\u2019s ok. Dude.", "Would it have been that difficult to call your stepdaughter and check that it was okay for him to eat the stew?", "YTA\n\nLike a huge AH. \n\nSo is Leo also an AH for eating 1/2 the entire pot. He\u2019s an inconsiderate pig.   ANY normal human being wouldn\u2019t eat 1/2 of a large pot of some else\u2019s ethic dish. Maybe 1 large serving and make a sandwich if you\u2019re still hungry. You need to teach your son some basic manners.\n\nBut you\u2019re much worse for blindly defending his AH manners without recognizing what atrocious manners your son has and just how inconsiderate he was towards your daughter.\n\nThen, to make matters 10x worse, you flippantly suggest just order pizza as if that\u2019s even remotely equivalent to a homemade ethic dish that cooked for hours. That super disrespectful to her cooking. Her friends were excited to eat her cooking - not some damned pizza.\n\nIt\u2019s like baking a whole lasagna for a dinner party and your son comes in and eats 1/2 of it. Nobody does that without clearing it with the cook.", "Yta - instead of Ana and your wife putting special notes, how about you and Leo have the common courtesy to ask THEM for permission?", "He should ba allowed to anything in his dads kitchen IF HE PREPARES IT HIMSELF. And if he gets permission to have some, he shouldnt eat HALF of it. \n\nA note? So youre just making up new rules as you go,  at your own convenience?\n\nYTA", "YTA. You fucking ASK. My god, why is that so hard. All the BS excuses in your last paragraph just make this so much worse, because you know, your wife knows, your stepdaughter knows, and we ALL know that you weren't being honest when you apologized. You fucked up. Own it.", "YTA \n\n\"His own father's kitchen\"\n\nDo you do anything in that kitchen?   Is the house not theirs as well?   What an utterly asinine take.", "YTA. You paying for the ingredients doesn't mean children who live in the home can't make something for their friends, though it does make sense to let everyone know if something can't be eaten. A sticky note does seem a little passive aggressive and roommate-esque to me, do you not have a group chat or just talk to each other? \n\nIt's understandable Ann is upset, and quiet around you, she's getting over it. It stung. \n\nAlso, while eating food in the kitchen is usually fine, if you're going to eat more than a serving of something you didn't make without confirming with the person who made it that that's alright, you're an asshole.", "YTA and I think you owe Ann a little more than an offer for a pizza to make it up. Although why didn\u2019t Leo just text Ann to ask her directly? Also Ann could have communicated about her plans better but the fault still lies on you at the end of the day for saying yes to Leo without checking first. If this is a repeated problem you could just have a family group chat where Leo (or anyone else in the house) can text to check if they can eat whatever food.", "YTA\n\nThis guy obviously doesn\u2019t do any cooking", "If I were Ann, I'd be very petty and start placing notes all over: My milk, my egg, my plate, my spoon, my POT OF STEW FOR MY FRIENDS, my apple, my cookie etc. The whole kitchen would be filled with notes. You know, just in case you decide to give Leo free rein again.", "So, let's say you're a skilled whittler. I buy a block of wood and say you can do anything you want with it. You spend 8 hours carving that block of wood into a gorgeous statue. While you step away to go to the bathroom, I give that statue to someone else, who promptly chops half of it off. They light one side on fire, so when you come back from the bathroom, there's only HALF of what you made. AITA? \n\nYes. Unequivocably, undeniably, without any question or doubt. The 8 hours of work you put into that statue means that my claim to the raw wood is no longer absolute. I did NOT have the right to give away YOUR work, even though I paid for the wood. 90+% of its value was in the whittling, at that point.\n\nSAME THING. You may have paid for the house, but it was Ann's skill and labor that made it into stew. It was her expertise that you gave away, NOT the raw ingredients you paid for. \n\nYTA. And you owe her a lot more than pizza.", "YTA.\n\nLeo ate *half* of a pot of stew meant for nine people? That's... okay, that's being an energetic, healthy, hungry 17-year-old, but damn yeah, he needs to know that's not right, especially when the one who gave him permission wasn't the one who actually cooked the food. He needs to ask his stepsister/stepmother's permission, not yours, and he needs to take \"no\" for an answer. \n\nYour response SHOULD have been \"I don't know Leo, please text wife/Ann to check in with them\".  And both of them have a right to be bummed that you regard them as cooks whose job it is to make tasty food for you and your son any time he drops in. It's their kitchen. It's their food. They do the cooking. You are not their employer.", "He ate half the pot. Half. That\u2019s more than a bowl. \n\nYTA. Leo is a gluttonous AH. \n\nHalf the pot in one sitting of food he didn\u2019t cook but felt entitled to devour.", "YTA. Why is the solution that she put a note and not just text your wife or Ann to ask if it\u2019s okay?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t make it; you should ask before you eat it. This seems just like common courtesy and manners. Yes, it\u2019s all of your home, but if you don\u2019t know whose it is, how much time was spent on it, or who it was for, how hard is it to just ask?\n\nOr is this some male \u201cI don\u2019t need to ask women for permission\u201d sexist bs?", "YTA you dipshit. You were fine up until the last paragraph of 'She made stew specifically for her friends, I don't see why my kid can't eat anything she makes because it's MY kitchen'. Cook your own fucking food for him then, you inconsiderate dickhole.", "YTA and frankly, so is Leo. Leo didn't have just a bowl he had half the pot. You made the assumption that the stew was for dinner for the family rather than checking with your wife or Ann. The fact that you haven't taught Leo better manners than to take half a pot of someone else's stew is just sad. You and Leo owe Ann more than apology. You can start by the two of you making dinner for Ana and all her friends to see just how much work goes into something like that.", "YTA for offering Leo food you didn't make even though you didn't know what the plans were for the food. Leo is an AH for eating HALF of a complicated pot of stew that someone else probably took hours to make. Even if your stepdaughter hadn't planned to have her friends over, he would still be in the wrong for eating such a large part of the stew. I can't abide men who do this. You spend hours cooking, making something tasty, and they come in and eat so much of it, before you even get a taste, that you end up barely getting enough for one whole meal, let alone the leftovers you had planned to have for tomorrow. You don't even get to enjoy the meal you put your own sweat into, because someone else was so thoughtless and entitled that they just make a decision that they get to eat as much as they want, as if they are the king, and they expect you to be grateful if they decide to leave anything behind. \n\nI hope you realize this probably would have turned out fine if Leo had helped himself to a small bowl, rather than eating half the pot.\n\nNext time he comes to the house and wants to eat cultural food that took hours to make, why don't you suggest he orders a pizza instead.", "Your son is TA. Who eats 4 portions of soup in one go? That\u2019s a completely unreasonable thing to do. Have a portion and make yourself. A sandwich, damn.", "OP better take your head out of your ass if you wants your relationship with your wife and step-daughter to be one of mutual respect and care. By letting your son shovel a dish created by either your new wife or step-daughter into his gob that obviously no one else has eaten from is assholery behavior. The wife or the daughter has spent time and energy in making that dish for a particular purpose and then some unaware or uncaring AH just helps themselves to it like a pig at the trough. \n\nJust remember OP, you will be an old MF one day, and if you don't respect your wife's boundaries or her daughter's, you will either find yourself alone sooner rather than later, or you will have your boundaries stomped on when you have no power.    It ain't about the f\\*cking food- AH.", "Dude. He ate HALF the pot. That is NOT okay even if the stew wasn't intended for guests. He singlehandedly could have ruined food planing for the week with this kind of selfishness. One or two plates max is fine. Half a pot??? Absolutely selfish. I'd get fucking pissed if someone did that to my dishes.\n\nAnd yes, you SHOULD always ask if a food, that you don't know what it's prepared for, is free to eat. Jesus that's common courtesy. When I see even cold leftovers I ask my family \"hey, did anyone plan on eating this?\". So often I make food that's intended for an event, and my family will ask me first if thats food for the house or for guests.\n\nThe food wasn't for you or for your wife or for your son. It was made specifically for a diner party with guests.\n\nThe way you acted was rude and entitled. Do you cook for the family? Because this feels like the kind of entitlement from someone who doesnt cook except for themself. \"Order a pizza\", please. A pizza to replace a slow cooked, labor intensive family recipe? You really do not know the amount of love and labor involved in cooking, do you? You just come off as ungrateful \n\nYTA.", "This reminds me of The Little Red Hen. YTA. Your kid is ill mannered and rude. One bowl would have been fine, but half the pot. This isn't he's \"a wrestler\", he's a glutton. She worked hard on a traditional recipe to impress her friends and you placate her with pizza? Wow.", "Wrestler or not, it seems he needs a lesson in manners and not eat half of a Stew made for a meal that no one has eaten any of yet. Seems as if maybe you should be a better parent and teach him these things or expect to cook your own food from now on because you both are about to ruin a good thing. These women don't HAVE to cook for you. Seems respect is lacking on your part. YTA", "YTA, and so is your son. Who the FUCK eats half a POT of stew? No one who has been taught manners, that's for sure. Yes, he asked if he could have SOME. Some is not equal to half. Plus, it wasn't your place to just automatically say yes without asking your wife or stepdaughter since clearly you weren't the one making the stew.\n\nI'll put notes on things I put in the fridge or freezer. I've never put a note on anything that was still cooking because no one living in or visiting my home would ever be so crass as to take more than a sample spoonful without asking the person doing the cooking. And usually they'd ask the cook even for that!", "YTA. Why can't Leo prepare food for himself? Is not allowed to use a knife or turn on the stove?\n\nYou and your son are incredibly rude and you making this sound like your step-daughter and tour wife are locking up all the food and starving your son is ridiculous. Your son is old enough to 1. Politley ask 2. Make food for himself.\n\nIf he was hungry, why didn't he just order himself a pizza? \n\nYou are teaching your son to be lazy and entitled.", "Nope, nope, nope. YTA. If you didn't make the food you ask the person who did before you give it away. \n\nYou are placing the burden to protect their food on the one who does the work instead of the one who does nothing but pig out. Your son had no right to that food but at least he asked before being a pig. You on the other hand gave away someone else's hard work and then have the audacity to defend your position. You should have told your son he needed to ask the cook before taking anything. \n\nAlso, crappy store bought pizza is not a replacement for hours of hard work. You could have at least offered to foot the bill at a local restaurant.", "YTA, common decency JEEEEZ. She spent hours making the soup and you think pizza would cut it??\nYou and your son should ask before eating! Not hard!! \nSure she can make an effort to put a note but always ask anyways. Cooking is a labor of love and takes a lot of effort and time.\nLastly\u2014this is not a rebuke to your son. It does not mean he\u2019s not a part of the family, that is a complete exaggeration . Has nothing to do with the situation.\nJust ask before eating!!", "YTA. Especially as you knew your son was a big eater. And he ate 4 people\u2019s portion of the stew that your stepdaughter made. If you made it , you could be generous with it. Else Ask your stepdaughter or your wife.", "YTA - Leo is only with you and your wife/stepdaughter on the weekends. I imagine that when meals are planned on the weekends, his presence is taken into consideration when determining how much to cook. If he happened to stop by on a day that he would normally not be there, and food had already been planned or prepared, more than likely his presence and portion was not taken into consideration. He should have checked with the person or people who cooked the food to determine if there\u2019s enough for him to have some.", "YTA Did you make the food ? No.\nWas it necessary for him to eat so much of someone else's prepared food ? No. \nDid you confirm with the maker of said food if he could have some ?

Total dick attitude and you know it.", "YTA\n\nNot because you let Leo have some stew, but because you let him eat half the pot.\n\nI'm sure Ann would have been fine with Leo having a serving or two but I'd be just as angry as she is if I found out that a dinner I made and invited people over for was half gone.", "YTA and your raising your son to be an AH. You don't just assume that everthing in the kitchen us up for grabs, and your son ate enough to feed 5 people? and you offered pizza in exchange? That's just insulting", "YTA.

He can\u2019t eat in our house\u201d that was NEVER said or implied. \nShe said he should ask, which he did, but then YOU said yes without asking. You\u2019re the one at fault, not Leo. When something is made, specifically a home cooked meal, that you do not know for sure it is for you to have, you ask. That\u2019s literally just common decency. Like, even when I visit my mom, I ask if something is ok to have or being saved for a special occasion. Leo seemed to know this common sensed, he asked, as he should have. You should have then asked if Ann was ok with that. This could have been avoided if you made one call/text. Especially because it was ANN\u2019S. Like, it\u2019s one thing to assume your partner made something for you for dinner (still should ask if it\u2019s ready/ok to eat right now) but it was your stepdaughter\u2019s. What you did was so disrespectful. Leo isn\u2019t the one who should be being punished (and he\u2019s not\u2026 the request they made is not only super reasonable but again, just common decency) you owe Ann and your wife a huge apology.

If you don't know who of them it is, ask them both. There is a lot of work and energy going into that kind of cooking, and it is really inconsiderate to not acknowledge that. While I generally agree that people living in the same household should be able to eat from the fridge, they should not have a blanket permit to do so without considering whether it was actually made for a specific purpose. I am sure Leo could have made himself a sandwich or cooked up something simple.", "YTA, you gave your son permission to eat something that you didn\u2019t cook, had no idea what the plans were for, without even considering that it was made for someone else.

My stepdaughter Ann (16f) used to split time between her parents but is currently with us full time as her father will be oversea until August. I also have a son, Leo (17m), who lives mostly with my ex-wife and with me on weekends. The kids go to different schools and have a decent relationship.\n\nMy wife and Ann are great cooks. My wife's parents came from another country and she and Ann regularly make exotic dishes from their homeland which are delicious. Both my son and I appreciate the dishes though we still have problems learning what is what.\n\nA few days ago Leo stopped by for something he left. Nobody was home so he let himself in. Leo said there was a big pot of stew on the stove and it smelled delicious and he asked if he could have some. My wife or Ann often made a huge batch of food when they cook, so it was nothing surprising. I told Leo to go ahead and just leave some for us. Now Leo is a wrestler and he eats a lot. A while later he sent me a photo, showing me how much stew was left in the pot. I could tell there was at least 5 servings left, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nAn hour later Ann called me, upset. She asked if I had eaten the stew she made. It was a special recipe from her grandma and she invited her friends over to try it. She said the stew was supposed to feed 9 people and she invited 6 friends but someone obviously had eaten almost half of her stew. I told her it was Leo and apologized, telling her she could order pizza for her friends and I would pay for it.

My question is, does he know that the biggest part of his apology should've been for making such a pig of himself? Being a wrestler doesn't excuse eating half the pot of stew. Even athletes that are trying to put on weight for a sport shouldn't be in the habit of eating that much food in a single sitting. Being a wrestler is no excuse for being a glutton. Asking permission from you to have \"some\" of the stew is excusable on his part, eating half the pot is not \"some\" and your excuse of him being a wrestler doesn't make it miraculously okay.

I'm almost 100% certain you made the \"his father's kitchen\" and the \"I buy most of the groceries\" comments (and more) deliberately within her earshot at the very least. That pretty much nullifies your apology. Suddenly expecting Ann and \"your wife\" to start labeling food *that's still on the stove* is crap when you and/or Leo are obviously quite capable of dialing a phone to ask if there are specific plans for something if you don't know. Besides, a post-it isn't gonna stick to a hot pot, the adhesive will melt and the sticky will wind up on a hot stove and be a fire hazard.\n\n>I think if Leo is not allowed to have the food then it's like he's not part of the family\n\nThis, combined with the \"my wife\" and the fact that you expect Ann and \"your wife\", who probably do the majority of the cooking,  to suddenly start labeling *hot cookware* so that you and Leo don't have to be respectful enough to *ask,* tells me that you actually have little to no respect for the women in your life, that they're second-class citizens whose feelings and efforts don't matter unless it's to your benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust in case I haven't made it perfectly clear what my opinion is...\n\n# YTA", "Yes, YTA.

When you wrote why you may be the asshole you said \"I had no prior knowledge she would invite **so many** people.\" Sounds like you knew dinner was for more than three that night, and still told your precious baby boy to go nuts. \n\nAlso, your son came by on a day he isn't regularly there. Even if the note rule was already in place, Ann likely wouldn't have used it.

Ann and your wife should not have to put a note on their food to say that they have plans for it, you just need to listen to them/ they need to communicate and talk to you if they are specifically making something for someone else.

Sometimes people make food for other people and not just for your family.\n\nAlso eating half the stew is crazy! Sure, Leo could be forgiven for not knowing it wasn't meant for him, but I still wouldn't forgive him for eating that much all at once. He could help himself to a bowl that's it, anything else was extremely rude of him and that's just not normal. Don't just talk to your kid about portion control, talk to him about manners. (Also did he call you to ask for it? You said no one was home, but I doubt that with food cooking, as that's a fire hazard.

Everything else aside, it's just really bizarre to me to eat something hot off the stove without at least checking with the chef to make sure it's done for many reasons.", "If they don\u2019t, how do they not have a family group chat in this day and age?", "right, it\u2019s *his* kitchen, but he has no idea when dinner plans are happening outside of family meals. that\u2019s sus. he probably forgot.", "Leo is still the AH, even though he asked. Had he asked the chef, she would likely also have said yes, with the implicitly understanding that he would take one serving, not half the pot. Like, who does that? So self-centered.", "In Texas (where I'm from) when someone has no home manners, we say they must've been raised in a barn.", "And why did the son call him, knowing either stepmom or stepsister made the stew??", "Also I'm sorry but how uninvolved in his stepdaughter's life is OP that he doesn't know she's hosting *nine people* for dinner at their place? That's not a friend staying for dinner after school, that's a whole dinner party that she prepared on her own? And OP just had no clue?", "Yep- methinks there is something more going on here that OP is leaving out", "It also puts the effort on someone else. He doesn't have to ask or check. They have to have the extra mental load. If I want my food to be here when I get back I have to tell them. Same as the idea of someone saying if you want help with the house work you have to make me a list. He thinks he is now not culpable because they didn't do extra work for him.", "And who even does that to begin with? If something is cooking, that means I'm using it or working on it. Why announce the obvious when it just takes common sense?", "That\u2019s not even the most asshole thing he did. Probably pretty tame. Let\u2019s just say I found out he\u2019d gotten married when his wife called me at 6 am (he wasn\u2019t married when I met him, but we later began long distance dating). I\u2019ve been married now to someone else for 10 years and he has much better manners. Cobbler guy had an annulment under his belt after less than a year.", "This bit! OP also said \u201cwife and  Ann are great cooks\u201d, and how both will regularly cook new and delicious meals for OP and son to enjoy. Makes it sound a lot like OP very much sees the kitchen as \u201cthe place that yummy food appears for me and my son to enjoy\u201d, and doesn\u2019t properly understand the time, skill, labor, and effort that go into cooking.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no indication that OP cooks or cleans in the post either. I usually try not to assume, but his little \u201cI pay for most of the groceries\u201d and \u201cmy son should be able to eat things from his own father\u2019s kitchen\u201d is pretty indicative of the dynamic in the household. OP seems to very well think he\u2019s the man of the house and his only obligation to contribute towards housekeeping and family obligations ends with financial deposits. And not only does \u201cI pay for most of the groceries, she cooks and cleans for all of us\u201d not mean that they have *shared* ownership of the kitchen, but even after all that, it\u2019s still *his* kitchen alone.\n\nSounds a lot like entitlement to me; \u201cthings that my wife and daughter make in the house we all live in should be freely available for me or my son to take as much as we want without even asking first, or limiting ourselves to a single serving\u201d. It would be different if OP and son also both frequently cook for the entire family (and if son lived with them for the majority of the time, because then at least the chef could be expected to plan for his large portion sizes when preparing meals for the entire family) but somehow I feel that\u2019s far from the case.", "I made peanut butter cookies with a friend to share with my class and my dad ate over half of them while they were cooling. I never bake so he had to have known it was for a reason, but he didn't care and never asked. In his mind, they were his because it's his kitchen, ignoring the fact that it was my labor that went into them. I hate him.", "They need to make all those \"exotic\" recipes.  A good stew or curry or whatever often takes the better part of a day to prepare and cook, not including shopping for specialty ingredients and cleanup.  Those things are delicious because of all the steps needed in cooking.", "I imagine he pointedly left out the expensive ingredients from the ethnic grocery store across the city where the ingredients were purchased for this \"exotic\" dish.", "I don't even think it makes sense for him to ask, it's still on the stove so I'd assume still cooking, who goes and eats half of the food before it's even served to the intended audience? If it was leftovers I can understand asking but not this", "I am convinced that men like this think the kitchen is magic. Food magically appears, mess magically gets cleaned.", "Exactly. It's clear that he's never actually planned or cooked anything special because he wouldn't equate ordering a pizza with planning and executing an elaborate meal for 9 people.", "tbh since the son *asked* and was told it was okay, i think his only fault in this is being so excessively greedy with how MUCH he took. i think it\u2019s reasonable to assume he trusted his dad to know if it was okay or not, and had he taken a single serving, or maybe even two, he would be completely free of blame in my eyes. however, it\u2019s extremely rude to take THAT MUCH of food clearly intended to be many servings (which would be easy to put together that it\u2019s either meant for many people or to last several days) and he\u2019s old enough to know that.", "That's the craziest part to me. When Leo asked OP for permission, OP should have said, \"ask your sister she's the one who made it.\" And it would have been over it. The son did nothing wrong since he asked for permission, OP shouldn't be giving permission for food he has no clue what it's purpose is for.", "That sucks, I'm sorry people are selfish.", "I assumed the picture was just to show that he followed dad's instructions. Of course dad's instructions sucked, but I don't think the son had any nefarious reasons for the picture.", ">Father is an A H for trying to reframe this story as his son \"not being allowed to eat in his own home.\n\nYeah, I feel sorry for his son's teachers when the dad has this attitude.", "I love the way you worded your response.  \"Not being allowed to eat in his own\" is NOT what happened.  You're spot on.", "This annoys me too. People who don\u2019t cook completely dismiss how much work it is. The work starts long before the actual cooking too. Planning a meal, budgeting and getting ingredients isn\u2019t easy. Cooking can be a literal workout. And to have others dismiss the hours or sometimes days of work that went into a meal? That\u2019s unbelievably rude.", "Yeah I was reading a lot of entitlement, misogyny, and ownership in his post. I hope this man is not an abuser.", "Sorry the son was 100% in the wrong for \n\nA. Eating half of a pot of stew that didn\u2019t belong to him. It\u2019s one thing to ask if you can have some food, but it\u2019s disrespectful af to eat half of it. \n\nB. Not asking the person who cooked it.", "Come.on. it was still wrong to eat half of a large pot of *anything* before it was had for the dinner it was clearly intended to be", "Oh no, they did NOT, did they? D: of all things, a birthday cake. Even a food thief should have some honor and not steal someones cake...", "That was my thinking, like it was a curry of some kind and meant to be eaten with rice.", "Because men. Doing manthings. \ud83d\ude44", "I think this also shows how a sense of entitlement is passed down from men to boys. Leo clearly knew he might have overstepped because he sent a photo of the stew (I'm gonna guess the way this went down is he got permission to try the stew, took a bowl, yummy, want more, took another bowl, yummy, repeat until \"Oh s$%t I ate half the pot, let me text dad and see if I'm going to get in trouble\"). Instead of his dad saying, \"Let me check with the ladies and see what are the plans for the stew\" or \"maybe a taste but not too much\" or \"You know what, best not to mess with it\" he said, \"yeah, just leave enough for the rest of us to have some.\" Which basically gives the son carte blanche to eat half the pot. And then dad tries to justify it with, my son is a wrestler, I paid for the groceries, Ann can just order her friends a pizza instead, my son can eat whatever he wants in his own father's kitchen, etc. This process is how reasonable boys turn into entitled men.", "This may sound bad but once I read \u201cexotic\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s what\u201d I was already thinking this post was going to go YTA or ESH. Often it\u2019s the type of people who are just very willfully ignorant about others and different cultures outside of their own backyard - \u201cJapanese, Chinese, what are these? Oh come on everyone looks the same lol. There are countries and thriving places in Africa? It\u2019s not like feed the children programs?\u201dtypes.", "It shows such a lack of respect for the effort put into cooking. Treating the kitchen like a damn vending machine :(", "THIS!  My husband pays for the groceries based on a two-week meal plan I've created (and written a list for).  Aside from the planning, I prepare/chop/dice/cook everything, plate and serve, then clean it all up.  I cook in bulk batches because we love leftovers, it's easier on the budget, and we have a lot of overlap in foods we like.  \n\nNever once has there been any entitlement of \"I pay, therefore I get to eat it all\" mentality.  If something is almost gone, he'll always leave me a portion (I had WLS so my portions are about 3/4 cup worth) to ensure I get the last call.  \n\nIf he's still hungry after dinner, he'll have a PB&J or protein shake instead of preventing me from saving leftovers.  He is a daily weight lifter and eats a ton but has the decency to ensure I get to enjoy what I cook multiple times before it's gone.\n\nThe balance works for us because we discussed how we'd handle groceries, budget, preparation, planning, etc., early on.", "It\u2019s possible to observe that something smells good while being hungry at the same time. \n\nIn fact, telling someone that a particular food \u201csmells good\u201d can be seen as a compliment intended to prompt an invitation to eat that specific dish instead of \u201cwhy don\u2019t you make yourself a sandwich.\u201d", "Wrestling has weight categories so wrestlers are usually eating amounts that allow them to stay within the category. That's usually not very much.", "Right? Leo knew his dad didn\u2019t make the stew and the kids have a good relationship so why didn\u2019t he ask the sister? Probs because he knew she might say no, or had another plan for it."]}
