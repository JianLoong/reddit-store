I told her that I would stop accepting the food from my ex.\n\nWhen my EX dropped the children off at the weekend, she came to me with a bag of food. Her freezer had broken and these meals were still frozen solid and she wanted to know if I wanted any of the meals. Anything that I wasn't going to take, she was going to drop off at her mum's for her. I did take some of the meals, especially of that dish that I love. When my Fianc\u00e9e found out I had taken food from my Ex, she went mad.

Since he agreed not to take the food, he should have at least talked to the fianc\u00e9e when he was offered the food again. He should also have asked the ex-wife not to offer him food once he accepted the fianc\u00e9e terms. A relationship is based on trust and communication and OP didn't handle that very well in this situation."]}
