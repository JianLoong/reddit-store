I'm glad you get along with her for the kids sake but turn it around; would you be comfortable with your fiance accepting something from her ex?\n\nNTA for putting your kids first when they are in a car accident. Your fiance needs to understand that your children will ALWAYS come first, and if she doesn't then maybe it is time to reconsider the relationship.", "NTA but wow all that stuff about the food is not relevant compared to your fianc\u00e9e complaining that you are caring for your own children after a traumatic event. Get RID OF HER. She will make your coparenting so much harder, and likely will be a total shit to your kids. Don\u2019t marry her, don\u2019t procreate with her. Congratulations on maintaining an amicable cordial relationship with your children\u2019s mom.", "It\u2019s funny because your fianc\u00e9e is putting your ex first, making her insecurities an issue. The jealousy thing might be something more understandable and a thing you can work through, but being upset you went to get your kids is a red flag factory. \n\nTell her to save her energy reconsidering your relationship because you\u2019re out. Also understand she\u2019s gonna tell everyone that you\u2019re still in love with your ex. \n\nNta", "NTA. Clearly, you can't marry that person.", "NTA. Dump her. What she did after your kids and ex were in an accident is disgusting. My bf was gone most the night with his grandparents after their young dog suddenly died on our anniversary and then he was on the phone to family most of the night, but I understood there\u2019s a lot going on with his family right now. We rescheduled dinner for tonight am I\u2019m looking forward to it. Kids always come first anyone who comes in your life has to understand that.", "Nta. \nI would take this time apart to evaluate the relationship between you as well. \nIt would be understanable for her to be upset over the food if she cooked for you and you prefered your ex's cooking over hers but that isn't the case. \nI think it's a huge red flag that she was upset that you got your kids & took them home vs letting them stay at a hospital all night. \nShe knew you have children & are an active and responsible parent in their lives, I don't understand where she thinks her feelings needed to be considered in something you did for your children. It would make me very upset if the person I was seeing got upset enough to leave & was reconsidering the relationship bc I had to pick my kid up due to the other parent having an emergency.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with accepting food from anyone, especially when it's a dish you can't make yourself. It's great that you and your ex have a good co-parenting relationship. My husband and his ex don't, and it causes all kinds of issues. It does sound like you and your fianc\u00e9e need to sit down and have a serious chat about your future. Speaking from experience, it's difficult to date someone who has children when you have none of your own. Going off your post and comments, I'd say your fianc\u00e9e had some unrealistic expectations. That needs to be sorted before you marry.", "Seriously, I hope this will be the end of this relationship, for OPs sake and the kids as well. My dad was in a relationship with a woman who was like this. She'd get mad at him for wanting to spend time with me, basically have temper tantrums to the point where I had to be the adult in the situation, at the age of 12. She went from being nice to me to blatantly resenting me for existing, which increased a lot when she moved into our house. Luckily my dad eventually ended things with her, and I remember the last thing she said to me while leaving was; \"are you happy?? You got what you wanted right??\" Lol, no yeah, all that shit I went through with her in my life is exactly what i wanted. Safe to say after that whole ordeal me and my dad still aren't as close as we used to be (which was pretty damn close), and it for sure damaged me in a lot of ways. Currently working on our relationship with my psychologists help, but it's definitely gonna take a lot to gain the trust back.\n\nEdit: NTA btw, but make sure you make it very clear to your kids that they will always be first, and please don't let this woman ruin their trust in you.", "This is not about the Iranian yogurt", "OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is probably going to complain when the kids are adults and still visit. I can already imagine her in the stepparent forums saying she thought she was finally free and could have OP all to herself.\n\nNTA, and I hope OP thinks carefully about what the next demand will be. His fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t sound fit to date someone with kids.", "Absolutely this. You\u2019re NTA. You enjoy a dish that only your ex makes and she takes that in to consideration when she cooks it. You share children in a kind, loving coparenting situation.", "You want a partner who also wants to have a cordial relationship NOT competition with the mother of your children. Partners support each other and so many people don\u2019t realize how stressful it is to have a tense, hateful coparenting relationship. Someone who thinks that\u2019s how it should be over what you are currently trying to create, has skewed vision and needs to work on her own feelings.", "I feel overall she\u2019s a big ole pile, but in this instance I feel like it\u2019s him. Solely because he had agreed to not taking food from her. If he had taken a stance against it, I would feel differently", "seriously the kids mean she\u2019s always going to be around", "Agreed. NTA. \n\nYou and your ex aren't following the narrative your fianc\u00e9 wants. Also when there are kids involved, they are always number one. If this is a problem, sounds like the relationship will always struggle.", "I am wondering if the kids also eat the food. If so then OP is even more N T A. It seems perfectly reasonable to have food around that they are used to eating and perfectly healthy to see their parents interact in a normal, friendly, calm, and accepting way. OP you are NTA and your fiance isn\u2019t showing your kids love and acceptance or exhibiting healthy coparenting behavior.", "Yeah the post went from 0-100 right there!", ">Your fianc\u00e9 got mad because you dropped dinner plans to get your children after a car accident?\n\nAbsolutely batshit crazy...Thank god you have seen all of this before you get married. If you still intend to marry her, I guess good luck because you might need it.", "Halva is amazing!", "But she's also upset he didn't make the kids get her a mother's day gift lmao...the woman who is mad their car crash interrupted her dinner", "Lol I\u2019m an Arab whose kin are dead or far away, and I\u2019m here to tell you there\u2019s no just looking up recipes and recreating what you remember. You can find gazillion hummus recipes but none of them will taste like my dad\u2019s. And I\u2019ve been trying for years to recreate the amazing leg of lamb my aunt cooked for my late dad when he was in hospital and refusing the nasty hospital food. It\u2019s not happening, and she\u2019s near the end with dementia so I (and my cousins) have to accept that that\u2019s a memory we can\u2019t recreate.\n\nSince these two are coparenting well and ex-wife\u2019s cooking is part of the kids\u2019 culture, the only issue here is that fianc\u00e9e needs to work on herself.", "His girlfriend sounds like a basket case.", "Oh you tried so so hard to stick that landing. Bless you.", "I was tending towards ESH (except the ex), both for this and for saying he wouldn't take the for anymore. \n\nEither he can pander to GF's insecurities and also keep his word about the food, or he can stand his ground and talk/work through her issues together, or he can end things. \nAnything else will hurt him, or GF, or the kids, unnecessarily.", "Yeah the first major red flag for me was mad about getting the kids after they had been in a car accident with their mother. They are top priority always.", "she's not step mom material by a mile", "Next she\u2019s gonna be demanding that the kids call her mom", "This is not about the Jordanian leftovers", "Why is this still a thing lol", "NTA. However, I would probably drop off some of the ex's frozen food at the fiancee's sister's house just to let her know OP made a choice.", "Swing and a miss", "Nope", "\"Would run\" works perfectly fine in that sentence. They were using the conditional tense not the past perfect tense (\"would have\"). I don't know if english grammar uses those specific titles for the tenses, as spanish does, but if you're going to correct other people's grammar you should at least be correct.\n\nIn other words: don't be a prick about grammar if you don't know what you're talking about", "buddy you need to end things with her immediately. She's evil", "You are their father!!  Holy heck! Don\u2019t marry this woman! She should not be dating someone with kids, let alone marrying them!", "You need to have left your fianc\u00e9 in the dust a long time ago. NTA but you will certainly be the ass (especially to your children) if you stay with this selfish woman.", "C\u2019mon, that should\u2019ve been the dealbreaker right there. Your fianc\u00e9e is not mature enough to become your partner and definitely not your children\u2019s stepmother.", "Honey, you should have dumped her immediately after that incident.

They don\u2019t deserve to have parents estranged because one of their partners is uncomfortable, you need someone that understands that your children come first.\n\nAbout the food situation IMO your ex-wife and your are friends now, and decided that the best for your family was to go separate ways. You love each other as co-parents and care for each other, but aren\u2019t in love.

She is the mother of your 3 children. I assume you two were together for a long time and, by the way you talk about your break up, she's probably a very good friend. \nBut I don't think there is much hope there.
