I lean more on the androgynous/masculine side of things, and she is very feminine.

I personally don't care how other's preserve me, but my parents want me to be extra feminine.\n\nSo today, me, my mom, and my younger sister went to the mall to go get last minute Halloween costumes. Me and my sister both had specific costumes in mind, but the one I was planning to wear sold out. I decided to go as something else, and I found a costume that I though would look good on me. Now, this costume was a men's one, and even though there was a female version, I wasn't really keen on wearing it. I felt like the skirt was too short, and the outfit overall was too sexualizing for me to feel comfortable to wear. I showed this to my mom, and she said that it was too expensive. I got another costume that was similar but less expensive, and she told me she doesn't want me to wear it, because it was a men's costume. I told her that the costume will be worn once or twice a year, and that it doesn't matter. I also told her that I didn't feel comfortable with the women's costume, cause it felt too revealing. She told me to choose another costume, but all the other women's costumes were basically the same in the sense that it was too revealing for my comfort. I told her this, but she told me that she will not pay for a men's costume, because I'm not a boy. \n\nHere were I think I'm TA. After this, I got mad cause I felt like she wasn't being reasonable, and that she wasn't listening to me. When my mom went to pay for my sisters costume, I walked out of the store and back to the car. When my mom and sister finished paying and went to the car, my dad asked why I can back earlier then they did, and my mom told him that I wanted to wear a men's costume. I also told him my reasoning, but he sided with my mom. Now my parents are saying that I should of listened to my mom, and now I don't have a costume.
