We moved our family south of the border. We have a large, older house, our kids attend a private school where they receive an education that is better than they were getting in the public schools they were attending. I do not have to do any snow shoveling or mowing. We have a housekeeper so my wife and I can concentrate on work and our kids. All in all it has worked out well for us. \n\nThe one small issue that we have not dealt with yet is our septic. It is on the list. It will cost a fair bit to upgrade the plumbing and the septic tank so that we can flush toilet paper. I could not get used to the idea of wiping and then putting the toilet paper in the garbage can by the toilet. So I invested about $300 and installed wand style bidets on all the toilets. It is like a handheld shower head that you use to spray water at you backside until it is clean. Then you can use a small amount of toilet paper to dry yourself. None of us have a problem putting damp toilet paper in the garbage. And let me tell you my butthole has never been cleaner. \n\nOur home also has a guest suite. We often host visitors. We make sure we explain about the plumbing and no one has any problems. Except for my parents. They think that it is gross. Twice they have visited and twice they have clogged the plumbing. They came again this summer and I wasn't having it. I removed the toilet paper from the restrooms that they would have access to. I replaced it with some hand towels that they could use to dry themselves with after they did their business. \n\nMy dad lost it. He started screaming from the bathroom that he needed toilet paper. I told him what to do through the door. He refused. I was not going to put up with his figurative or literal shit any more so I walked away. He eventually came out wearing only one sock. He and my mom packed up and left. They went to stay at a local hotel that has modern plumbing. It meant they had to be up early if they wanted to have breakfast with the kids. And that they could not stay very late drinking wine and enjoying the sunsets and such with us. And they spent a bunch of money on the hotel.\n\nMy wife and I just came up for a family wedding and my parents were telling everyone how poorly I treated them and that I made their stay so uncomfortable they had to waste money staying at a hotel when I have guest quarters. I mostly kept my mouth shut until other people started telling me I was an asshole for doing this. So I told them the whole story. Including my dad wiping his ass with a sock. It all became a hilarious story at the wedding and my dad is now saying I made him look like a fool. \n\nI just think he could have tried to do as I requested to begin with.

The pressure itself is pretty sufficient at getting everything clean. If you need a little extra help? Use bidet soap.\n\nI\u2019m going to make a point here in regards to the soap. If you are only using TP and wiping yourself - by the time you get to the shower there will still be urine/poop particles around your genitals and anus. Paper cannot fully clean it off of you.
