I packed my stuff quickly because I wanted to call the dorm's front desk and so that people couldn't take my stuff as I wanted to go somewhere more private to call. I was going to call in the stairwell until I opened the door and saw 3 guys smoking their joints on the landing below me. I went back to my corner and called the front desk giving descriptions of what was going on and a description of one of the people I saw because they sprinted down the stairs and went to another floor.  \n\n\nAs I was talking about it with some other people later, one other person said that I was pulling a \"dick move\" because they could've gotten arrested and had their lives ruined. I argued that its finals season and the smell from smoking weed could be an inconvenience to multiple people as the smell rapidly took over (note that the stairwell is all indoors and is not open to the outside), but then the other person said that I was getting petty over an inconvenience.   \n\n\nSome things to note is that the residence agreement of the dorm states smoking weed in living spaces is a felony, so they would have been punished fairly harshly for what they did. In addition, this is in Texas, so there are different factors regarding how fair the police and the justice system is for different people. Also, the dorm building is located near the edge of the campus, so I personally felt like they could've gone off campus to a nearby field or something to smoke their joint.

They would\u2019ve been arrested because when caught by the RA after the residence hall front desk calls them the RA must then notify their boss and authorities would be involved especially if it\u2019s not legal in campus, in city, or state. It\u2019s the same for underage drinking(I\u2019ve seen it happen to my own peers across the hall from me in the dorm). You should\u2019ve just left them alone and went about your business else where and let them get caught on their own.", "NTA I really hate people smoking in stairways to avoid the cold or whatever. Smoking in a stairway makes the smoke and smell linger and can trigger asthma attacks and other similar issues. Don't smoke in small, enclosed spaces.", "NTA, you didn't call the cops. And while I think your reaction was a little overly sensitive, I'm saying that comfortably from a state where it's legal. \n\nThat said, though, from a pothead perspective, those guys were idiots. Smoking in a stairwell? Anyone might walk in -- they're damn lucky it was you instead of the RA, or campus security or something. I may think weed should be legal, but I don't think that means every building should be hotboxed.\n\nIf they're going to be that dumb about it, then they're going to get caught sooner or later, anyway.", "NTA. I don't think weed smokers should just be able to smoke weed wherever, and especially not indoors. It's disgusting (the smell) and I sure as heck would not want to be subjected to it.\n\nAnd I don't think it's your fault or your problem that the law is so extreme. I don't by any means think weed should be a felony. I personally even think it should be legal. But I don't think smokers of any kind should just get to smoke in areas that affect others.", "NTA. They should\u2019ve found a place outside to do that.", "NTA\u2026they shouldn\u2019t smoke inside the dorms. It\u2019s not allowed for a reason and not everyone wants to smell smoke and some people have bad reactions to it. They could have and should have went outside or at least near an open window.", "NTA, though I personally would have approached it differently. smoking in a shared facility like this is an absolute dick move. Other people live in these dorms, and the people smoking have no idea whether the other people in these dorms have allergies, trauma, or simply don't appreciate the smell of weed in their home. \n\nconsidering how negatively this could affect someone's life as it's a felony in your state, personally I wouldn't have given descriptions of the individuals, I would have waited until the next morning and then let someone know I noticed a weed smell. I would aim for the action that is taken to be a public warning to all students, rather than potential punitive measures towards individuals.", "NTA.\n\nThey were smoking in your residence.

I don't think they should be smoking in dorms for the same reason you shouldn't smoke a cigarette or vape indoors. And the smell of weed honestly makes me dizzy and sick, so I would've been upset as well. I probably wouldn't have called the front desk, but I do understand why you did it. For the record, I do think weed should be legal, but I don't think you should smoke anything indoors.", "Nta as they were \"breaking the rules\" but I promise you ... You will be exiled. Nothing but a narc. I knew kids like you in college. They were never invited to hang out or to a party and then cried they had no friends.

Time to make new friends and memories. Next time I suggest you join in. After your work is done of course.", "NTA. Being a good neighbor means not smoking where others have to deal with your smoke. Would be the same as any other activity that produces a weird smell.

They could choose to smoke somewhere else or attend school where its legal.", "NTA They could\u2019ve figured out a better spot to imbibe. I thought weed was illegal in Texas? (Yes I know it\u2019s still obtainable, just questioning the rationale of the smokers.)", "Okay, unpopular opinion apparently but NTA. Smelling weed makes me super sick (vomiting  migraine, etc) and if they were doing it where anybody could smell it they are the butts. I would've reported them because if it's finals season, I don't need to be sick and nobody else does either. Also secondhand highs are real and people are trying to study and don't need to be dealing with it during finals. If it wasn't finals I'd say you all suck but during finals it's on them.

They were literally minding their business then you decided they deserved that dumbass punishment your school has.", "NTA and this is coming from someone who lives in a house with people who smoke daily in an illegal state. I would've reported it too in the dorms.

Personally I would have just studied in a library, dorm, somewhere else.\n\nThough smoking pot indoors is just an AH move.

Or get an oilpen or something so nobody can really tell.\n\n>\"\"dick move\" because they could've gotten arrested and had their lives ruined.\"\n\nI mean they ultimately chose to do stupid shit in a stupid place.", "NTA. Weed smoke is disgusting and can trigger asthma attacks in some people. If you changed this to smoking cigarettes in a non-smoking dorm, the Y T A comments would be nonexistent.\n\nThe smoking weed wasn\u2019t the issue, it was doing it indoors around others. It\u2019s also very unlikely they would have gotten into serious trouble. Dorm and laws aside, most colleges are pretty lenient about stuff like this because they know it\u2019s a college campus.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t call the cops- you called the desk.

They can smoke if they want, but I mean there\u2019s gonna be consequences. It would be the same if they were just cigs.

They shouldn't smoke at stairwell it's common area.", "NTA. There is no excuse for smoking in a public space. You are not petty. It\u2019s more than an inconvenience.", "NTA. Anyone who says you are were probably on that landing once.", "I mean technically n t a I guess since you're super into following rules but like, don't expect to make/keep many friends while being a narc in college... \n\nESH, like yes, they could've found a better place to smoke, and yes, it's against the rules, but the swiftness and dedication you put towards snitching doesn't sit right with me... \n\nLike \"smoking weed in living spaces is a felony so they would've fairly punished.\" Bruh what????? Slapping a felony on someone for smoking weed in college is fair and acceptable to you?  I really really want to say y t a... you must be super fun at parties.", "it wasn't possible for you to ask them to smoke outside? sincere question", "YTA, because you could ruin somebody's life by reporting their weed smoking in Texas.   You don't narc on somebody for a felony unless somebody's life is in danger.   Nobody's lives are endangered by smelling weed when they walk down the stairs.   If the cops were called, they could have killed somebody (if nonwhite), they could have arrested somebody, causing them to forfeit scholarships and possible future jobs, and they might even take them to court and get them convicted of a felony.\n\nThe punishment is a lot more serious than the crime.   Don't turn people in for smoking weed.   In a state where it's legal, sure, tell the RA.  But in a state where they're at risk of going to prison, they would be fools to smoke outside.", "I think I should\u2019ve added that it\u2019s a non smoking building as well, but it seems too late for that", "NTA.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t care about weed - it\u2019s perfectly fine.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s ATROCIOUS. The smell is horrendous and stays where it\u2019s at for like, two years \ud83d\ude06.

That's fine if you want to do that yourself, but using it in an enclosed space of a public area in the middle of exam periods, that's a dick move.\n\nPeople shouldn't get annoyed at you because you follow the law and take your study seriously. If they don't want to be pinged for a felony, they shouldn't commit a felony, regardless of whether the law is stupid.  \n\n\nEdit: I am seeing a lot about the cops in Houston and how that affects people thoughts. I have never been to Texas (and I don't live in the US). Can someone explain what is happening with the Texas police? That could change my thoughts on who is in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nWeed smoke not only smells bad but also gives me a migraine. Migraines for me last weeks at a time and have horrible side effects (can\u2019t see, vomiting, ears ringing). That\u2019s not something I\u2019d want to deal with during finals week studying, exams or any other exam. No one is saying they shouldn\u2019t smoke. No one is saying they should get in trouble.

Who smokes in an internal stairwell?", "NTA It\u2019s funny how they always worry about their lives being ruined when they get turned in, but never when they make the decision to break the laws/rules.\n\nAlso, the number of people killed by police for smoking is almost nonexistent, but if you REALLY are that worried about it, why are you committing a felony in a public building?", "YTA!

It's about learning to live, with,  interact with,  and support others - especially those who think and do things differently than you.

They'd probs get issued a warning and if they continue causing problems they'll get kicked out of the dorm. Weed smells nasty, and they should when using an illegal substance than to not do it out in a shared space. And while I wasn't in Texas, I've worked in 2 southern states where weed is illegal. Universities understand that teens are going to make stupid, illegal choices with drugs and alcohol, especially in their first year of college.

I packed my stuff quickly because I wanted to call the dorm's front desk and so that people couldn't take my stuff as I wanted to go somewhere more private to call. I was going to call in the stairwell until I opened the door and saw 3 guys smoking their joints on the landing below me. I went back to my corner and called the front desk giving descriptions of what was going on and a description of one of the people I saw because they sprinted down the stairs and went to another floor.  \n\n\nAs I was talking about it with some other people later, one other person said that I was pulling a \"dick move\" because they could've gotten arrested and had their lives ruined. I argued that its finals season and the smell from smoking weed could be an inconvenience to multiple people as the smell rapidly took over (note that the stairwell is all indoors and is not open to the outside), but then the other person said that I was getting petty over an inconvenience.   \n\n\nSome things to note is that the residence agreement of the dorm states smoking weed in living spaces is a felony, so they would have been punished fairly harshly for what they did. In addition, this is in Texas, so there are different factors regarding how fair the police and the justice system is for different people. Also, the dorm building is located near the edge of the campus, so I personally felt like they could've gone off campus to a nearby field or something to smoke their joint. I don't really know what else to add, so have at it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
