{"id": 22732, "submission_id": "154odg3", "title": "AITA for Leaving GF and Sister behind then going to dinner by myself", "selftext": "So hello Redditors,\n\nYes, the title but I want to give some background. So I (19m) am rather impatient for a lot of things: Loading Screens on Video games, wifi, games downloading. etc. Couple this with my GF T(19f) and always taking a while to get ready and well you see the issue we are having.\n\nAn example I can give is we wanted to go to a house party that started at 9, we agreed to go there at 10:30 ended up arriving at 12, and the cops had come and shut the place down. Same with Movies, we wanted to watch the Blackening at 6:30 but we ended up arriving at 7:30 and missing most of the movie, I still don't understand why she had to get made up for a movie.\n\nTo put it into further perspective, for my gamers out there, I am a huge Souls fan, so one time I decide to play Dark Souls 3 while t was getting ready. From when t started to when T finished, I had beaten Sister Friede, bought one of The Ringed City DLC, waited for the DLC to download, fought and beat the demon bosses of the DLC.\n\nSo recently my Sister let's call her M has come home, so we decided hey, let's go get some dinner. We found a restaurant we didn't need to reserve for and we were set. now my T and m are Best Friends, and so they both take a while to get ready, after like a good hour or so, I asked how long they would be taking and they said 5 minutes, now, my sister had not taken a shower, and my gf was still just putting on Makeup, so I decided to order an Uber, I let them know and immediately they get mad, saying I should wait and an Uber is a waste of money.\n\nI ordered the Uber anyway and waited at the restaurant for them, I ordered my drink and appetizer and 30 mins later they arrived, to say T was mad is an understatement, she gave me the silent treatment all night. When I dropped her off at home, she didn't give me a goodbye kiss. I asked my sister what was up and she says: \"Listen, I understand that we take a while but looking good takes time, we didn't need to reserve, if you were hungry you could have eaten a snack, she wanted to go with you to dinner, for you to compliment her, you know like a boyfriend does, but straight up you just left.\"\n\nSo AITA\n\nEdit: Okay woah, I didn't really expect this, there are so many comments, but I am going to answer the most common ones\n\nFirstly why are you still with her if her being late affects you: Because, despite this, she is an amazing girlfriend, for my 18th birthday she got all my friends together, actually did one of my buddies projects for him, so that they could all be there for my birthday, so she is honestly selfless at times, she's just horribly late\n\nSecondly, why did you leave if there was no reservation: I was hungry, I was up at 6 helping my parents pack and get ready for their flight, I had work, so really I just wanted to eat something\n\nThirdly, I haven't really spoken to her about this, but I will, this has been the biggest advice, outside of break up with her.

Stop waiting. Just go.", "NTA. Actions have consequences.\n\nIf you are doing this to make a point and encourage more considerate behavior, you should not expect that your sister and girlfriend will be **happy** to change.

They are both being disrespectful as hell. It\u2019s not that hard to be on time.", "NTA, entitled ladies.

Both of them knew they take ages to get ready so it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure they are on time.

It's unreasonable to know, in advance, when you're wanting to be somewhere, and to only start the (apparently hours long process of) getting ready at that time.

I have communicated very clearly that if we say we are going to leave at 8 I will give you 15 minutes and the car will be leaving at 8:16 if you\u2019re in it or not.  To me you don\u2019t have any consideration for my time.  So clear expectations is the key to me.  I\u2019m not mad you\u2019re late and you\u2019re not mad I left.", "NTA I'm a girl and this would drive me insane. I hate being late, I'm impatient too. Who the hell takes that long to get ready???? \n\nReassess the relationship. How much does this matter to you? And is it a deal breaker?", "NTA\n\nThey know how long it takes to get ready. They should start at the appropriate time to be ready on time (or earlier) or \u201cgo light\u201d.", "NTA! you need to set  the boundary that when plans are made you would like to be able to be on time or she gets left behind. T & M are young adults and need to learn that looks don't matter more than punctuality and other peoples time.", "NTA. I was taught growing up that making people wait for you is not only rude but very, very selfish. Five, ten minutes occasionally is ok, stuff happens but an hour or more? That's sending a clear message that you feel your time is much more valuable and you don't care about the other person's convenience or comfort at all.", "ESH\n\nIt sucks to deal with chronically late people, but given you had no time constraints and no reservation, now was not the time to ditch them imo. \n\nBut beyond this one situation, have you considered that y\u2019all aren\u2019t compatible? Chronic lateness rarely finds a cure, so you need to ask yourself if you can truly deal with this issue for the foreseeable future", "In my opinion, ESH.\n\nYour GF is taking to long, being late for 1hr or even 2, which is a big problem.\n\nBut you are also the AH, as not only did you go alone, leaving T and M behind, when there was no reservation and could had waited a bit, but you also didnt talk about it with your GF.\n\nIn an relationship, communication is the key, talk about how you feel, what goes through your mind, and try to find a common ground; an exercise we do with my GF is give 5 minutes, she speaks for that time, without me interrupting then I do the same, so that way, we both say what we feel and get both points of views so that we can try to resolve the issue together.", "You're impatient with games loading? You would have hated the 80s when it could easily take 25 minutes of screeching for a game to load from a cassette tape on a Commodore Vic 20.  Anyway, it's extremely rude, inconsiderate and selfish to be late so much, and the only way to curb that behaviour is to lay down the start time as a line in the sand and just leave if they aren't ready. NTA", "NTA", "I'll say ESH. You're in the wrong for leaving them while they were getting ready and going to the restaurant without them. But also, they're in the wrong for constantly never respecting dates and times because \"looking good takes time.\" Everyone knew that they were going to take forever to get ready, that's on all of you.", "ESH, I understand why you would be annoyed about the previous situations mentioned but in thus case it doesn't sound like yous set a time and you just left when you decided you were done waiting?", "ESH but I totally get you. I have gotten less patience with that behavior over time.", "No judgement it sounds like there\u2019s a mix of issue\u2019s happening here. Absolutely GF needs to figure out time management if she truly needs over an hour to get ready then she needs to recognize that and plan for it. OP needs to learn a little patience it\u2019s totally one thing to get annoyed if need to be somewhere at a set time but dinner seems mostly like OP just didn\u2019t feel like waiting. try having an adult conversation and get somewhat on the same page", "I don't think you were wrong to not wait for them but I do think you're wrong to get into a relationship with someone who is a poor fit for you. You know that you're not a patient person (this is something you should work on though, you're an adult!). You must also have known this girl did this before you got so far as to call her your girlfriend, so what did you expect? Did you think she was suddenly going to change her behaviour just because you said so? That's stupid and short sighted. Be a good guy and move on, find someone who is more your speed. \n\nIn terms of a judgement I'm going with ESH because while they are absolutely ridiculous and should learn better time management, you shouldn't expect any different when that's the girl you chose. If you aren't willing to just accept your choice then make a different one!", "Soft ESH\n\nI am not good at dealing with late people, it's incredibly rude.  They should have done better. \n\nBut dude, if your sister is telling you your girlfriend wants to spend time with you and hear compliments from you, you need to work on what kind of boyfriend you are.  I bet the conversation they had after you left highlighted everything you do that annoys your gf.\n\nThe two of you should probably talk it out before this spirals.", "ESH - these ladies KNOW they take a while to get ready, they KNOW how long it takes and they should start earlier to get ready to go out. But you also need to get that impatience under control. You can\u2019t control others or the world, and sometimes there are delays (like traffic, lines for things,etc). So learning to manage your feelings better is going to make you feel better (I too used to be impatient but have become much more easy going for most things).", "Looking good takes time? These are the same people that are always late \"because of traffic.\" PLAN AHEAD like everyone else. If you know you're going to spend a lot of time primping, then start earlier. \n\nSoft YTA for leaving them, but there's a point where it gets ridiculous.\n\nThere's an episode of Everyone Loves Raymond just like this.", "[deleted]", "YTA, what you did was incredibly rude. If a film is at 6:30 then yeah she should have started getting ready earlier but her appearance is clearly important to her. Storming out and basically wrecking dinner when you could have easily gone a bit later is childish and selfish.

For example in this case they can argue that they had no set time to be there.  But other times when they do have a specific time it makes an impact. For example with the house party. If he had gone alone and she showed up at 12 then she would've missed out. (Bad example cuz cops, but I stand by it)", "That is what I am always yelling at country songs.  Dudes always seem to want the girl with the nice skin and done up makeup and fancy hair, but then they are dragging down women who spend a lot of money on their skin care routine and doing their hair up and spending time on makeup.  This is the trade off.  \n\nThat being said, when you agree to leave at a time then it is rude to constantly be late for that time. When he set this up as 'I hate to wait for video games to load' I was 100% ready for him to be the asshole because that is a pretty low bar for having patience.  But over an hour late is way too long.  \n\nThat also being said, late people very rarely turn things around - they are usually late people forever.

Next day, he calls and is confused why we left without him. I spelled it out and he was never late again (at least with me).\n\nLong story short, yes, we women take a little longer to get ready but not *that* long.  Making you wait is rude.  Making anyone wait is rude.  \n\nShe knows what makeup and clothes she has, as well as what styles to do her hair and accessories needed.

However, as someone with a best friend who is chronically late to everything (literally everything) I will say you can\u2019t be shocked if that person continues to be late. You can choose not to tolerate it anymore and stop making plans with them. But also you can\u2019t suddenly expect them to change. Also my pro top is saying you have to be somewhere earlier than you do so when they\u2019re late you end up on time. Again, if that\u2019s not for you understandable! But expecting a different result from late people will leave you angry every time.", "Unfortunately, this is the only way to let time wasters know, you aint mucking around.

I got to the point where i would completely cancel after a certain time", "NTA. The problem isn\u2019t the time to get ready, it that they can\u2019t figure out to start early enough to be on time, so they end up wasting yours. That\u2019s rude, and inconsiderate.", "NTA. Being late is a flaw not a virtue girls.\n\nAlso, \"looking good takes time\" is a bs excuse for superficial people lmao if it takes so long then start sooner sheesh", "Eh, it\u2019s hard to say because you jumped to an option most people get to after far more conversation. Usually, there\u2019s a conversation to establish that this is a problem, then several instances of you guys discussing going someplace at a certain time and her making you both late and then a period during which she\u2019s supposed to be working on it and *then* you get to the \u201cok, take the time you want to take, but know that I will leave at this time, with or without you.\u201d And then you break up probably lol. But tbf some people get it sorted. And stay together. Jumping to the end without giving her the chance to fix it was kind of of a buttface move, even if it would ultimately be the move to make after some time had passed. \n\nNow, in terms of the problem, you think of it as a practical thing, she thinks of it as the time being more important for you than her company or level of comfort. I have a whole family history with punctuality, so I am sensitive to how much of an AH move it is to be late and make other people late to things, but I also know how those people feel when they get left behind and how they view it. If she\u2019s the type of person to be uncomfortable if she doesn\u2019t look at certain way when out of the house, then she\u2019ll see you asking her to skip her prep as you not caring that she\u2019ll spend all of her time on the outing feeling distracted and self-conscious, and therefore enjoying the outing far less. You may need to coach the ask in terms of how she prepares. \u201cBabe I want you to feel beautiful and amazing when we\u2019re out and I know for you that means doing a bunch of stuff beforehand otherwise you won\u2019t enjoy yourself as much. And you know that I want to get there on time so that we have time to enjoy everything and see everyone and get to our next thing on time. And otherwise, I won\u2019t enjoy myself as much. So please remember that the compromise is (for example) that you have to start getting ready now, so you have a full x hours for prep before we leave, so please start on this now so we aren\u2019t late.\u201d", "Your sisters explained why T she had good reason to be mad. You explained why you had good reason to leave. Now go fucking talk to T and reach a compromised like the motherfucking functional person you can be.", "Makeup girly here!

Literally watched her hand slow down brushing her hair. The voice tone and word choice were \"hurry up anxious\" and the body language was \"alllllllll the time in the world\". I was hungry so when she said \"20 more minutes\" at 30 minutes late already, I said I'd be outside reading, and actually walked to the corner and grabbed a truck taco (lol), ate it there, walked back, pulled out my book, read for 20 MORE minutes, so now we are looking at 45 minutes, walked in and she ... was ... still ... doing ... her hair, hadn't started her make-up yet, wasn't dressed. We are now an hour late to the reservation. I said, do you want me to call and move it or cancel? She cried, no, god, how late is it!?! and then continued to slowly brush her hair. She wasn't ready for 75 more minutes. I had actually already called and moved the reservation so I just called and moved it again. I think I did so three times.
