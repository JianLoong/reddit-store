So I (19m) am rather impatient for a lot of things: Loading Screens on Video games, wifi, games downloading. etc. Couple this with my GF T(19f) and always taking a while to get ready and well you see the issue we are having.\n\nAn example I can give is we wanted to go to a house party that started at 9, we agreed to go there at 10:30 ended up arriving at 12, and the cops had come and shut the place down. Same with Movies, we wanted to watch the Blackening at 6:30 but we ended up arriving at 7:30 and missing most of the movie, I still don't understand why she had to get made up for a movie. \n\nTo put it into further perspective, for my gamers out there, I am a huge Souls fan, so one time I decide to play Dark Souls 3 while t was getting ready. From when t started to when T finished, I had beaten Sister Friede, bought one of The Ringed City DLC, waited for the DLC to download, fought and beat the demon bosses of the DLC.\n\nSo recently my Sister let's call her M has come home, so we decided hey, let's go get some dinner. We found a restaurant we didn't need to reserve for and we were set. now my T and m are Best Friends, and so they both take a while to get ready, after like a good hour or so, I asked how long they would be taking and they said 5 minutes, now, my sister had not taken a shower, and my gf was still just putting on Makeup, so I decided to order an Uber, I let them know and immediately they get mad, saying I should wait and an Uber is a waste of money.\n\nI ordered the Uber anyway and waited at the restaurant for them, I ordered my drink and appetizer and 30 mins later they arrived, to say T was mad is an understatement, she gave me the silent treatment all night. When I dropped her off at home, she didn't give me a goodbye kiss. I asked my sister what was up and she says: \"Listen, I understand that we take a while but looking good takes time, we didn't need to reserve, if you were hungry you could have eaten a snack, she wanted to go with you to dinner, for you to compliment her, you know like a boyfriend does, but straight up you just left.\"\n\nSo AITA", "created_utc": 1689852699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154odg3/aita_for_leaving_gf_and_sister_behind_then_going/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He would arrive with everyone else. Once, he did actually turn up that hour early and realised why we did it....maybe try this?", "NTA: Being not on time is extremly unpolite. But also it does not seem like you ever really talked to her about it. She is an adult though. She should know how to be on time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso also: Who still goes into a movie after being an hour late?", "NTA they need to learn to be ready on time because it\u2019s just rude to everyone waiting for them. Stop waiting. Just go.", "NTA. Actions have consequences.\n\nIf you are doing this to make a point and encourage more considerate behavior, you should not expect that your sister and girlfriend will be **happy** to change. People only change when they don't like something, and they're going to let you know.", "NTA \n\nMaybe next time they won\u2019t spend hours getting ready", "NTA over 1.5 hours to get ready is nuts.", "NTA- as a woman, I make sure to start getting ready to have plenty of time to make it to things on time. They are both being disrespectful as hell. It\u2019s not that hard to be on time.", "NTA, entitled ladies. NO ONE is absolved for being perpetually late, they are rude and inconsiderate of other people time. They know how long they need to get ready, plan for it! You do not need to be treated like a door mat.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone's got a finite time and she's wasting yours. If she doesn't want to get left behind, she should start getting ready on time. \n\nNovody needs to be told to be on time. It should be a given.", "NTA, my pet hate is people who just can\u2019t get their crap together to be on time, if you know it\u2019s going to take you half an hour or an hour to get ready, start getting ready nice and early so you can leave on time. Both of them knew they take ages to get ready so it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure they are on time. It\u2019s also incredibly rude for people to be constantly late and shows a complete disregard to the other person.", "You are NTA but I do not think your girl is right for you.", "NTA. It's unreasonable to know, in advance, when you're wanting to be somewhere, and to only start the (apparently hours long process of) getting ready at that time. That's not fucking normal and expectable behavior. It's rude. \"Looking good\" does not take that long, unless your definition of \"good\" is \"red carpet ready\" and your typical appearance at home is \"Sinthea from Rugrats\".", "I don't understand what gaming has to do with gf not being ready on time \n\nHave you ever discussed  the issue with your gf?   \n\nNTA.   Always being late is rude.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she likes to fuck around with your time, now she's finding out", "NTA-  I cannot stand being late and everyone in my inner circle knows that including my husband.  I have left everyone at one point in my life except my mother.  I have communicated very clearly that if we say we are going to leave at 8 I will give you 15 minutes and the car will be leaving at 8:16 if you\u2019re in it or not.  To me you don\u2019t have any consideration for my time.  So clear expectations is the key to me.  I\u2019m not mad you\u2019re late and you\u2019re not mad I left.", "NTA I'm a girl and this would drive me insane. I hate being late, I'm impatient too. Who the hell takes that long to get ready???? \n\nReassess the relationship. How much does this matter to you? And is it a deal breaker?", "NTA\n\nThey know how long it takes to get ready. They should start at the appropriate time to be ready on time (or earlier) or \u201cgo light\u201d.", "NTA! you need to set  the boundary that when plans are made you would like to be able to be on time or she gets left behind. T & M are young adults and need to learn that looks don't matter more than punctuality and other peoples time.", "NTA. I was taught growing up that making people wait for you is not only rude but very, very selfish. Five, ten minutes occasionally is ok, stuff happens but an hour or more? That's sending a clear message that you feel your time is much more valuable and you don't care about the other person's convenience or comfort at all.", "ESH\n\nIt sucks to deal with chronically late people, but given you had no time constraints and no reservation, now was not the time to ditch them imo. \n\nBut beyond this one situation, have you considered that y\u2019all aren\u2019t compatible? Chronic lateness rarely finds a cure, so you need to ask yourself if you can truly deal with this issue for the foreseeable future", "In my opinion, ESH.\n\nYour GF is taking to long, being late for 1hr or even 2, which is a big problem.\n\nBut you are also the AH, as not only did you go alone, leaving T and M behind, when there was no reservation and could had waited a bit, but you also didnt talk about it with your GF.\n\nIn an relationship, communication is the key, talk about how you feel, what goes through your mind, and try to find a common ground; an exercise we do with my GF is give 5 minutes, she speaks for that time, without me interrupting then I do the same, so that way, we both say what we feel and get both points of views so that we can try to resolve the issue together.", "You're impatient with games loading? You would have hated the 80s when it could easily take 25 minutes of screeching for a game to load from a cassette tape on a Commodore Vic 20.  Anyway, it's extremely rude, inconsiderate and selfish to be late so much, and the only way to curb that behaviour is to lay down the start time as a line in the sand and just leave if they aren't ready. NTA", "NTA", "I'll say ESH. You're in the wrong for leaving them while they were getting ready and going to the restaurant without them. But also, they're in the wrong for constantly never respecting dates and times because \"looking good takes time.\" Everyone knew that they were going to take forever to get ready, that's on all of you.", "ESH, I understand why you would be annoyed about the previous situations mentioned but in thus case it doesn't sound like yous set a time and you just left when you decided you were done waiting?", "ESH but I totally get you. I have gotten less patience with that behavior over time.", "No judgement it sounds like there\u2019s a mix of issue\u2019s happening here. Absolutely GF needs to figure out time management if she truly needs over an hour to get ready then she needs to recognize that and plan for it. OP needs to learn a little patience it\u2019s totally one thing to get annoyed if need to be somewhere at a set time but dinner seems mostly like OP just didn\u2019t feel like waiting. try having an adult conversation and get somewhat on the same page", "I don't think you were wrong to not wait for them but I do think you're wrong to get into a relationship with someone who is a poor fit for you. You know that you're not a patient person (this is something you should work on though, you're an adult!). You must also have known this girl did this before you got so far as to call her your girlfriend, so what did you expect? Did you think she was suddenly going to change her behaviour just because you said so? That's stupid and short sighted. Be a good guy and move on, find someone who is more your speed. \n\nIn terms of a judgement I'm going with ESH because while they are absolutely ridiculous and should learn better time management, you shouldn't expect any different when that's the girl you chose. If you aren't willing to just accept your choice then make a different one!", "Soft ESH\n\nI am not good at dealing with late people, it's incredibly rude.  They should have done better. \n\nBut dude, if your sister is telling you your girlfriend wants to spend time with you and hear compliments from you, you need to work on what kind of boyfriend you are.  I bet the conversation they had after you left highlighted everything you do that annoys your gf.\n\nThe two of you should probably talk it out before this spirals.", "ESH - these ladies KNOW they take a while to get ready, they KNOW how long it takes and they should start earlier to get ready to go out. But you also need to get that impatience under control. You can\u2019t control others or the world, and sometimes there are delays (like traffic, lines for things,etc). So learning to manage your feelings better is going to make you feel better (I too used to be impatient but have become much more easy going for most things).", "Looking good takes time? These are the same people that are always late \"because of traffic.\" PLAN AHEAD like everyone else. If you know you're going to spend a lot of time primping, then start earlier. \n\nSoft YTA for leaving them, but there's a point where it gets ridiculous.\n\nThere's an episode of Everyone Loves Raymond just like this.", "Soft YTA, I understand that waiting can be annoying as hell, but you need to grow up. The timing makes me want to lean toward E S H, but in this specific instance YTA. If it bothers you that much, maybe start saying you need to arrive an hour earlier to try and mitigate the actual lateness", "YTA, what you did was incredibly rude. If a film is at 6:30 then yeah she should have started getting ready earlier but her appearance is clearly important to her. Storming out and basically wrecking dinner when you could have easily gone a bit later is childish and selfish. Why are you even together if it's that much of a problem for you?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou sure are not reeady for a relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not a Miss America contest.\n\nYou mention other times when you were delayed by an hour or more. Why do you keep doing this?\n\nDo you realize that there are women who can simply get up and go somewhere? No makeup, and they've already showered. See a movie? Fine, they say.

If they have elaborate makeup and hair stuff to do, they should start earlier. Then, let her know that while she looks great when she\u2019s done up, you will be leaving the house at <whatever time> and if that\u2019s too hard for her to do, she can meet you there. I\u2019m super punctual and that shit drives me nuts.

Not really found a Bette solution though", "We were able to change the ticket and get a later time, which was why we still went", "Taking hours to get ready isn\u2019t even an issue! It\u2019s the fact that they don\u2019t know how to budget their time and get ready sooner. They clearly know how long the routine takes by now, so they just need to get ready earlier!", "Because if you knew the game, you'll understand that OP waited a very very long time.", "I will give you context. My partner plays Dark Souls. It is *not* an easy game to play. OP was able to clear and progress probably over an hour of gameplay.", "He posted that to provide context, he's indicated he's impatient. He wants to know if hes was TA because he's too impatient and the gfs time issues are not really a problem or if the issue lies with her.", "So you think OP should have waited for a time when they would be negatively affected by being late to do this?\n\nThat seems like a much worse idea than doing it at a time when they won't be negatively affected, IMO.", "Or, this was the perfect time to do this as it was a low stakes outing that affected no one but these three. An honest conversation needs to be had with both the sister and gf, but they might not listen.", "They are adults. As an adult it can be expected to be at least a bit on time. 15 minutes late is ok sometimes but every time sometimes HOURS. Nuhuu...\n\nOP should have maybe talked to her about it but he should not need to. THis is common sense. Don't be late too much. People won't always wait for her royal highness.", "That is childish and these are suppose to be adults. (telling someone wrong times) I get sick and tired of family member or friends being late and have left or cancelled my plans on perpetually late people, My time is worth more than silly games.", "Bro she took like an hour and a half. How long does he have to wait?", "Rude? And it isn't rude to make people wait? Isn't it rude to overlook the fact that others have plans/a life/maybe OP was hungry? Isn't it rude to make people wait for more than an hour for no emergency at all? \n\nIt isn't rude to stick to the schedule. If she needs time, she has to manage her time correctly and not expect that time will stop flowing because princess needs to look good.\n\nIf a boyfriend/a date made me wait for more than an hour because he wanted to look good, be sure he would look good by himself because I certainly won't be there to see it. \n\nIf someone makes me wait for an hour, he can talk about flat tire, car crash, kidney failure but \"looking good takes time\"? F no.", "NTA. Looking good takes time. So they need to take enough time to do it and not just keep others waiting for them. It's highly disrespectfull.\n\nIf they had a job interview, they couldn't say \"sorry I'm late but looking good takes time\". \n\nI'm a woman. I can take some time to get ready sometimes. That's why I start to prepare myself \"way too early\" according to my husband.", "If you are with a girl who has to be completely made up every time she leaves the house, this is the deal. Take it or leave it. \n\nNow, if it\u2019s a time management thing, there are things she can do to improve that. But if it\u2019s about vanity or insecurity\u2026. Well that\u2019s a lot harder to work on. \n\nI understand having fun and taking your time to put on a full face and feeling good about yourself. But if it\u2019s such a crutch that you can\u2019t get ready in 30 minutes or less when you\u2019re running late, it\u2019s a problem. \n\nMakeup should be a fun \u201cextra\u201d for most people and not a necessity. (Obviously it\u2019s different if someone has something that needs to be covered up for some reason)\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d leave it. Not a fan of high maintenance people.", "If you were able to get a different time slot for the movie, why did you still miss half of it?", "I think the point gets lost when there are no negatives. For example in this case they can argue that they had no set time to be there.  But other times when they do have a specific time it makes an impact. For example with the house party. If he had gone alone and she showed up at 12 then she would've missed out. (Bad example cuz cops, but I stand by it)", "That is what I am always yelling at country songs.  Dudes always seem to want the girl with the nice skin and done up makeup and fancy hair, but then they are dragging down women who spend a lot of money on their skin care routine and doing their hair up and spending time on makeup.  This is the trade off.  \n\nThat being said, when you agree to leave at a time then it is rude to constantly be late for that time. When he set this up as 'I hate to wait for video games to load' I was 100% ready for him to be the asshole because that is a pretty low bar for having patience.  But over an hour late is way too long.  \n\nThat also being said, late people very rarely turn things around - they are usually late people forever.  She is being very rude by wasting his time, but considering she won't admit that it is rude it is very unlikely she will ever change.  Your best bet is continue to leave when you said you would and either it will blow up the relationship or she will adjust and start getting ready earlier.", "Yes. I had a friend like this. She was always late because she couldn\u2019t be seen in public without always being totally made up.", "Why don't these people just start getting ready earlier? I know I always need an hour to get ready - 10 mins to do hair, 5 mins for makeup and 45 mins to have a breakdown because I don't know what to wear. I always start getting ready an hour before we've scheduled to leave."]}
