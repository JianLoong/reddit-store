I'm not from English speaking country. The country I flew from is a neighboring country, and is an English speaking country. Ethnically, we look similar.\n\nI bought aisle seat when I booked my flight. This is due to medical reason. I have lower cervical instability where my neck spine shifts a little and press my C7-C8 nerves, causing numbness and stiffness on finger 4&5 on both hands. It's managable by muscle strengthening, but in the meantime, I couldn't stay in sitting/lying position for more than 15 mins without my fingers going numb and stiff. I chose aisle seat so I could walk to toilet often easily to relieve my neck and reduce numbness. \n\nWhen I boarded the aircraft, I saw a guy (around early 30s) was already on my seat, with an old man next to him. I used English as I didn't know which nationality he is, and asked him politely to please move as that was my seat. He smiled and asked me if I'd switch seat with him cause he needs to help his dad to the toilet due to his old age, in my native language. I wouldn't have minded had his seat were aisle seat. But his seat was the middle seat in the opposite row. So I said no, in English. I'm a pretty anxious person and I don't like confrontation. Being multilingual doesn't help either when you're nervous. I could register my native language, but I almost answered this guy in Chinese instead of English or my native language; I was that anxious. He understood English. When I asked him to please move again, he frowned and insisted that he needs to be next to his dad and how a young woman like me (I look highschool-ish) can't be considerate to an old man. At this point I was pissed but also almost took the guy's seat just so I wouldn't block other passengers behind me. \n\nThankfully, one of the stewardess saw me blocking the way and asked to see our boarding pass. She straight away gave this guy a stern look and asked him to go back to his seat. He tried to argue but the stewardess asked him to move and gave my seat to me. So he did, unhappily. I thanked the stewardess and got myself comfortable. Then, an old lady (from my city cause she talked in my native language) offered to switch seat with this guy's dad, so this guy and his dad now sat next to each other in the opposite row. This guy thanked the old lady, and said in my native language, \"I see old people have more manners! I guess some people are just that heartless\". I don't think this guy knew I understood what he said. My English accent is like the neighboring country's since I studied and lived there for few years, so is my overall style. Anyway, pretty much him, the old lady, and some other passengers (all middle to old aged people) from my city chimed in and talked crap about me, while I pretended to not understand anything. AITA here? Like seriously was I the crazy one for wanting to sit at my seat that I'd paid for?

Or, even better, planned ahead like a normal person.  I make sure I book a seat next to my Dad even if I have to pay for it.  That guy didn't care that you had the seat.

I also planned to ask the person next to me if they\u2019d mind switching, which I did, and she declined. IMO it\u2019s important to ask politely, and if you\u2019re an anxious people pleaser like me, I told her as I asked that I understood if she didn\u2019t want to (it meant changing an aisle seat to a window and I know lots of people have strong preferences). It\u2019s my fault I had to change flights last minute, or at least, my issue to deal with, not anyone else\u2019s. But I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH to politely ask as long as you accept any answer; sometimes flights have to be booked late and you can\u2019t find the right amount of seats together.
