I'm not from English speaking country. The country I flew from is a neighboring country, and is an English speaking country. Ethnically, we look similar.\n\nI bought aisle seat when I booked my flight. This is due to medical reason. I have lower cervical instability where my neck spine shifts a little and press my C7-C8 nerves, causing numbness and stiffness on finger 4&5 on both hands. It's managable by muscle strengthening, but in the meantime, I couldn't stay in sitting/lying position for more than 15 mins without my fingers going numb and stiff. I chose aisle seat so I could walk to toilet often easily to relieve my neck and reduce numbness. \n\nWhen I boarded the aircraft, I saw a guy (around early 30s) was already on my seat, with an old man next to him. I used English as I didn't know which nationality he is, and asked him politely to please move as that was my seat. He smiled and asked me if I'd switch seat with him cause he needs to help his dad to the toilet due to his old age, in my native language. I wouldn't have minded had his seat were aisle seat. But his seat was the middle seat in the opposite row. So I said no, in English. I'm a pretty anxious person and I don't like confrontation. Being multilingual doesn't help either when you're nervous. I could register my native language, but I almost answered this guy in Chinese instead of English or my native language; I was that anxious. He understood English. When I asked him to please move again, he frowned and insisted that he needs to be next to his dad and how a young woman like me (I look highschool-ish) can't be considerate to an old man. At this point I was pissed but also almost took the guy's seat just so I wouldn't block other passengers behind me. \n\nThankfully, one of the stewardess saw me blocking the way and asked to see our boarding pass. She straight away gave this guy a stern look and asked him to go back to his seat. He tried to argue but the stewardess asked him to move and gave my seat to me. So he did, unhappily. I thanked the stewardess and got myself comfortable. Then, an old lady (from my city cause she talked in my native language) offered to switch seat with this guy's dad, so this guy and his dad now sat next to each other in the opposite row. This guy thanked the old lady, and said in my native language, \"I see old people have more manners! I guess some people are just that heartless\". I don't think this guy knew I understood what he said. My English accent is like the neighboring country's since I studied and lived there for few years, so is my overall style. Anyway, pretty much him, the old lady, and some other passengers (all middle to old aged people) from my city chimed in and talked crap about me, while I pretended to not understand anything. AITA here? Like seriously was I the crazy one for wanting to sit at my seat that I'd paid for? Why did so many people on board defend this guy?", "created_utc": 1680494086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12a8nw7/aita_for_telling_a_guy_to_move_from_the_seat_id/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, it was a nice thing for the other woman to offer to change seats, but that has nothing to do with your original argument with the man.

However, when people more demand it than ask, I tell them that for X dollars (usually double the price airline charges to select seat) I will switch. I figured if airline can charge double to check the bag at airport vs. pre-buying it so can I.
