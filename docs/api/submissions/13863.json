I'm not from English speaking country. The country I flew from is a neighboring country, and is an English speaking country. Ethnically, we look similar.\n\nI bought aisle seat when I booked my flight. This is due to medical reason. I have lower cervical instability where my neck spine shifts a little and press my C7-C8 nerves, causing numbness and stiffness on finger 4&5 on both hands. It's managable by muscle strengthening, but in the meantime, I couldn't stay in sitting/lying position for more than 15 mins without my fingers going numb and stiff. I chose aisle seat so I could walk to toilet often easily to relieve my neck and reduce numbness. \n\nWhen I boarded the aircraft, I saw a guy (around early 30s) was already on my seat, with an old man next to him. I used English as I didn't know which nationality he is, and asked him politely to please move as that was my seat. He smiled and asked me if I'd switch seat with him cause he needs to help his dad to the toilet due to his old age, in my native language. I wouldn't have minded had his seat were aisle seat. But his seat was the middle seat in the opposite row. So I said no, in English. I'm a pretty anxious person and I don't like confrontation. Being multilingual doesn't help either when you're nervous. I could register my native language, but I almost answered this guy in Chinese instead of English or my native language; I was that anxious. He understood English. When I asked him to please move again, he frowned and insisted that he needs to be next to his dad and how a young woman like me (I look highschool-ish) can't be considerate to an old man. At this point I was pissed but also almost took the guy's seat just so I wouldn't block other passengers behind me. \n\nThankfully, one of the stewardess saw me blocking the way and asked to see our boarding pass. She straight away gave this guy a stern look and asked him to go back to his seat. He tried to argue but the stewardess asked him to move and gave my seat to me. So he did, unhappily. I thanked the stewardess and got myself comfortable. Then, an old lady (from my city cause she talked in my native language) offered to switch seat with this guy's dad, so this guy and his dad now sat next to each other in the opposite row. This guy thanked the old lady, and said in my native language, \"I see old people have more manners! I guess some people are just that heartless\". I don't think this guy knew I understood what he said. My English accent is like the neighboring country's since I studied and lived there for few years, so is my overall style. Anyway, pretty much him, the old lady, and some other passengers (all middle to old aged people) from my city chimed in and talked crap about me, while I pretended to not understand anything. AITA here? Like seriously was I the crazy one for wanting to sit at my seat that I'd paid for?

I am only 25 and served in the military. Being only 4\u201911 and 90lbs when I joined, lifting a 70-85lb pack that I could fit in caused some back problems for myself\u2026 I look like I could be 18 so when I mention my back at all I get some pretty skeptical looks and comments from people until I mention that I served.

I also have nerve pain and the same fingers get numb for me, pretty sure I might have the same thing as you but all drs want to do is give me meds for treatment instead of finding out the exact reasoning.

It made me gain half a pound a day while I was on it. I've also had a spinal epidural with NO relief. I'm trying Botox for my neck here in just a few weeks. I have hEDS so every joint in my body is compromised and unstable, so it's been quite the road to relief. Do you have stenosis in your neck too?", "Omg same I was diagnosed with hEDS close to my lower cervical instability!! I didn't gain weight with Lyrica but I was essentially a dead man walking. Lyrica combined with muscle relaxant 3 times a day, and another mild painkiller, like damn I felt so lethargic the whole day, for 3 months. I essentially had to close down business and relied on my insurance to cover everything and had complete rest with frequent hospital visits for TENS and Ultrasound therapy cause they said it was \"tense muscle\". \n\nI don't have stenosis no. There're mild bulging discs on my C4-C8 but they aren't that bad to the point I'd need surgery. My last neuro was the key to my diagnosis. He was the only one who asked me to do neck extension and flexion X-ray instead of cervical MRI. My neck's hyperextended and hyperflexed, pretty much in extended and flexed position almost all spine section (except C2&C3) shifts and compressed the forramen. He looked at the rest of my anatomy and refered me to rheum and diagnosed me with possible lower cervical instability. There's not much he could do since the condition isn't resolved by surgery so he advised me to find physiotherapist who works with hypermobile cases and to consult rheum for possible HSD. The TENS and Ultrasound therapy I did for 2 months essentially worsen my condition because my muscles are now too relaxed and nothing helps supporting my neck spine besides my loosey ligaments and degenerative discs. I've since worked on strenghtening my right knee and my left shoulder which sublax often too. It's a long journey, but at least now I know how to treat them.", "I am a young-ish person who got tired of explaining my scoliosis, bulged disc, bad SI joint, etc, everything else that people side eye you for because you're \"Young and don't look injured\". Then a year and a half I was in a car crash that further injured existing issues and added new ones. I found out when I just say \"I was badly injured in a car crash\", people no longer side eye me.

I was driving my convertible with the top down and pulled into a handicap parking space at the grocery store. I was probably 55 at the time. A woman that looked to be a little younger than me stopped me and asked if I happened to see that I was in a handicap parking space.

But yea, unfortunately hypermobility isn't considered serious enough most of the time. Even more sad, doctors don't even consider hypermobility as the root issue to our health problems. Like why did no one believe me when I said my knee dislocated by itself when I was only gonna sit down 12 years ago? My ortho back then just said that was weird and impossible and that's it \ud83d\ude44. The 6 neuros I went to for my numb fingers also said it's just tense muscle. Please take us more seriously.

We took her mom's car (a nicer car than two 20 somethings should be driving) because it was easiest for her to get in and out of.

I notice a man staring at me from the corner of my eye. He starts approaching the car as I get out. He comes over and starts BERATING me for parking in the handicap spot, yelling and calling me \"selfish\" and that the spot \"is meant for people with handicaps\" and I was \"too young\" to be handicapped.\n\nAnyway, I let him prattle on because it was amusing. A crowd started to gather. At that point, I hit the trunk button on the key fob, reached into the open trunk, pulled out my cousin's wheelchair and plunked it on the ground to open it with a loud THUNK.\n\nThat shut the idiot up *immediately*, he turned bright red, turned on his heel and just about ran away. Of course, he did NOT apologize. I got my cousin in her chair, we had a good laugh and went into the store..."]}
