I'm not from English speaking country. The country I flew from is a neighboring country, and is an English speaking country. Ethnically, we look similar.\n\nI bought aisle seat when I booked my flight. This is due to medical reason. I have lower cervical instability where my neck spine shifts a little and press my C7-C8 nerves, causing numbness and stiffness on finger 4&5 on both hands. It's managable by muscle strengthening, but in the meantime, I couldn't stay in sitting/lying position for more than 15 mins without my fingers going numb and stiff. I chose aisle seat so I could walk to toilet often easily to relieve my neck and reduce numbness. \n\nWhen I boarded the aircraft, I saw a guy (around early 30s) was already on my seat, with an old man next to him. I used English as I didn't know which nationality he is, and asked him politely to please move as that was my seat. He smiled and asked me if I'd switch seat with him cause he needs to help his dad to the toilet due to his old age, in my native language. I wouldn't have minded had his seat were aisle seat. But his seat was the middle seat in the opposite row. So I said no, in English. I'm a pretty anxious person and I don't like confrontation. Being multilingual doesn't help either when you're nervous. I could register my native language, but I almost answered this guy in Chinese instead of English or my native language; I was that anxious. He understood English. When I asked him to please move again, he frowned and insisted that he needs to be next to his dad and how a young woman like me (I look highschool-ish) can't be considerate to an old man. At this point I was pissed but also almost took the guy's seat just so I wouldn't block other passengers behind me. \n\nThankfully, one of the stewardess saw me blocking the way and asked to see our boarding pass. She straight away gave this guy a stern look and asked him to go back to his seat. He tried to argue but the stewardess asked him to move and gave my seat to me. So he did, unhappily. I thanked the stewardess and got myself comfortable. Then, an old lady (from my city cause she talked in my native language) offered to switch seat with this guy's dad, so this guy and his dad now sat next to each other in the opposite row. This guy thanked the old lady, and said in my native language, \"I see old people have more manners! I guess some people are just that heartless\". I don't think this guy knew I understood what he said. My English accent is like the neighboring country's since I studied and lived there for few years, so is my overall style. Anyway, pretty much him, the old lady, and some other passengers (all middle to old aged people) from my city chimed in and talked crap about me, while I pretended to not understand anything. AITA here? Like seriously was I the crazy one for wanting to sit at my seat that I'd paid for?

I'm thankful for having some relief via painful injections to, but also thankful he's not going to be cutting me open!", ">I'm Asian too and i feel like the older generations thinks that the younger generation owe them something and we have to bend over backwards for them in any situation. \n\nThis is soooo true. The whole \"you should respect elderlies no matter what\" in East Asian culture is so misconstruted now. Respect goes both ways and often times, the older generations don't give us as much respect.", "OP clarified in the comments, that they said they have a medical condition but the guy did not believe, and wanted a detailed description of the issues.", ">YTA for not explaining.\n\nPeople have compassion. If you had explained\n\n\n-No is a complete sentence.\n\n-When Op bought that seat, she did not buy it with a sprinking of \"I will EXPLAIN my medical history to sit on it\"\n\n- if saying no to someone on your seat should ruin their day, they need a better offense. \n\nAdvising people to divulge their personal history so others are not offended, is one very foolish way to live. Wouldn't you agree?", ">If the son knew that his father needed help to go to the bathroom, why was the son in the Aisle seat and the father in the middle seat?\n\nYou know I never thought of this. Even when they moved to the opposite row, the son still sat in the aisle seat and his father sat in the middle seat. I saw them getting up once and his old dad needed help in getting up, but he walked to toilet by himself. You're right though, it would've been easier for the dad to get out had he sat in the aisle seat.", "I'm sorry, why would I need to thank the old lady? She switched seat for the guy not for me? She gave snide comment about me too so no, I wouldn't even think of thanking her in any way.", "I did! I couldn't include it due to word count but I answered other comment here that I'd told him I have medical issue and needed aisle seat. He rolled his eyes, leaning back and asked \"What medical issue?\". I wasn't gonna go into rant on my condition when I was already holding a long line behind me.", "NTA and thanks you may have given me very valuable information I never considered about my own neck issues. Hope yours feels better!", "I understand this, but honestly it's exhausting as a disabled person to always have to disclose your this information. Able-bodied people should at the same time be better to not assume that someone is just an asshole instead of them possibly having an inviable illness.\nIt's hard to always have to be the one defending yourself even in situation like this, where OP had every right to their seat.", "Wow, so you did try to explain it to him, and he was still being rude?  Sorry about that.  This guy just wanted to be a bully.  He shouldn't have taken your seat in the first place.  He could have waited until you sat down to ask.  Or, even better, planned ahead like a normal person.  I make sure I book a seat next to my Dad even if I have to pay for it.  That guy didn't care that you had the seat. It wouldn't have mattered what you told him.  He seemed to want the world to bow down for him.  I'm glad the flight attendant helped you out.  You should have said something in the same language.  Anything at all.  Maybe they would have shut up.  Haha.", "We say that  on this sub a lot - no is a complete sentence, but it\u2019s not true.  It\u2019s a statement that asserts our rights, but it does nothing to help the people around us accept and be happy with our \u201cno\u201d \u2026 which in a harmonious community is the goal.\n\nWhich is less hurtful \u2026 \u201cthank you granny, I love that you made me a peanut cake, but I\u2019m actually allergic \u201c, or \u201cno I\u2019m not eating that\u201d ?\n\nBe honest.  When people tell you \u201cno\u201d you\u2019re always more understanding when you understand why.  It\u2019s only when YOU give a \u201cno\u201d that you think it\u2019s a complete sentence .", "You DON'T need to. Sorry if I came off wrong.  It was supposed to be because it would be funny - they wouldn't know how to respond. It would confuse them which is entertaining.", ">and I have the spine of an 80 year old and I need to get up and move regularly.\"\n\nI don't have that much courage to say that in the first place \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I'm in SEA too, if I say it sarcastically like that they'll think I'm being extra rude. Then the old people who chimed in afterwards would prob even bring up how my parents didn't raise me right lmao.", "Ohhh you meant thanking her sarcastically. I def read that in the wrong tone the first time lol", "My bad"]}
