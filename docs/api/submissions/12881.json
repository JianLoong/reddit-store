This is very sus that he can\u2019t do a very simple task for you", "NTA. He cheatin\u2019 on you and don\u2019t want the other girl to find out about you.", "NTA he blocked you? Dump his ass.", "He straight up blocked you?!  Is he 12?", "NTA - why would it be so difficult for him to tag your account??  Does he know how or need you to show him how easy it is?  Maybe don't let him follow you unless he uses a tag.  It's odd that he would just refuse.", "Your boyfriend sounds like an ass. I don\u2019t know how the relationship is, but I\u2019m sorry you have to live with him, especially after the childish thing about blocking all your accounts. That\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9 for sure.", "INFO: Why does he refuse to? What are his stated reasons?", "Info: is he claiming your cooking as his own? \n\nI wonder how he\u2019d respond if you added a tiny bit of food coloring to your dishes - just enough to make it visually unappealing. If it doesn\u2019t affect the flavor and he\u2019s not using pictures for his account because he no longer has your permission, everything will be fine, right?", "NTA but there are so many red flags", "NTA\n\nwhat a strange hill for him to die on. Dont drop this, something is going on on his personal accounts. Does he publicly post about you? Are you on his profile?", "NTA and several red flags.\n\nIMO, by not tagging you and also now blocking you completely (which prevents you from even commenting on his posts) he may be hiding from someone the fact that you exist, and that he even has a girlfriend at all.", "Watermark your photos.  You can google how to watermark social media photos.", "Nta he doesn't want to tag you so the other women he's messaging on insta won't see. I guarantee if you check those DMs he's creeping.", "NTA. He's being shady.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who doesn\u2019t use social media like IG or TikTok, I still know that it\u2019s basic ass manners to tag and credit the actual creator. The amount of on-the-face disrespect here is unreal\u2026makes me think he must be testing you to see if you put up with his shit. Not a good sign at all.", "NTA -he is -my boyfriend once shared the dumbest stuff on his truck page because I asked him to for my business (I rent tents for kids bday sleepovers)  -it was a picture of unicorns on a page with truck and truck parts -its the only way to grow on insta", "NTA and I wouldn't trust him because seems kinda fishy to me. The combo of won't post you and if he is weird about what he does on the app isn't great. He maybe blocked you so you wouldn't comment on it that you cooked it and blow up his spot", "NTA! It\u2019s a good way to market.", "NTA - I wonder why he wouldn\u2019t just do it, it\u2019s such a small thing to him but a big deal to you since it shows he supporting you. Have you told him that it\u2019s not about the amount of followers but it\u2019s just about the support it gives you?", "NAH about the picture-tagging, but he does sound pretty childish for blocking your accounts instead of any other resolution / communication - dump him!", "Stop cooking for him. NTA", "NTA. That would be like stealing photos from a photographer, posting them without any credit whatsoever, getting mad at the photographer for having the *audacity* to ask for the credit they deserve, then blocking them so as to continue stealing their content without consequences. That\u2019s not how partners should treat each other in a relationship.", "Stop cooking for him", "ESH. You had me until you said you want to repost. If he is private about his Instagram, it makes sense that he won't want you to repost and expose his account to your followers.\n\nETA: I see this as a consent and respect issue. \n\nIf you don't consent to him posting your cooking without crediting you, he should respect that. If he doesn't consent to you reposting his stories, you should respect that.\n\nUpdated judgment following responses from OP.", "For this? YTA\n\nThere's nothing more ridiculous than asking for people you know to tag you in something so you can grow your account. If you want to grow your account do it without begin people to post about it something and tag you. I have some friends that are trying to be influencer and I started slowing distance myself from them because they will do this kind of things and this will remove part of the fun of going out with them... is like going out transform in something they do so they can take pictures or make videos and not because they enjoy my company. \n\nBUT you said he dosen't post anything about you.... can I ask if you're his only girlfriend?", "YTA\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a silly request. I\u2019d block you too. Lol. It\u2019s desperate sounding. If people are meant to follow you, they will on their own.", "YTA, this is hilarious. Calling him immature but at the same time getting annoyed that you don\u2019t get internet points from his 3 followers. Yes, blocking you as petty as hell but he\u2019s told you no several times. Take it as a compliment that he likes your food enough to share it with his mates and leave it at that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who needs to not know you cook for him\u2026", "I agree", "If that is your first thought then you have problems people cook and people post just because he doesn\u2019t want to tag OP doesn\u2019t mean that he is cheating and besides tell me this how would the other girl supposedly saying he is cheating how would she know that OP is his girlfriend and not a friend who just cooked the food and he is tagging to support them hmmmmm? You so quick to jump to conclusions but the conclusion is infront of you OP said they want to promote their business on their page so it\u2019s most likely that all there is on their page is straight food pics.

He refuses to give you reasons, and is private about his instagram but won\u2019t tell you why? The only case for not posting anything about your partner is if it is a business/influencer account or you barely post.

It feels like there's got to be something else going on here, though, so rather than try to figure out who's the asshole I think you need to figure out what his actual motivation is here.", "Why so private about Instagram? Seems weird to me but maybe I'm missing something about instagram", "Yeah, there are so many red flags here. I think you need to think about why he's hiding you like this.", "he's either got a side piece or his insta is connected to tindr or some other dating site", "Have you ever checked to see if he has another more active account? I had an SO who did the same - I never post what\u2019s the big deal- bullshit.

Since when did tagging someone in a photo mean that you actually support them people ask questions in the comments more than they look at the tags so he could tell them that OP cooked it there.", "He doesn\u2019t post much just on his stories but I\u2019m never on his stories. He says he thinks it\u2019s cringey when people post their significant others on their social media. He doesn\u2019t like PDA either but that part doesn\u2019t bother me too much. And no I don\u2019t post him because he doesn\u2019t post me so I rather not", "I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t post his family or friends. Just him and his traveling.", "bc his insta is probably linked in his tindr lmao", "Yeah I hope he tells me the truth. This looks bad", "But the point is that he shouldn\u2019t be posting it if it\u2019s mine. I can be private about my cooking then if he\u2019s so private about his account. He can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too. He doesn\u2019t want to remove it from his story", "Yeah? I mean, I don't personally post food very often, but when I do, it is for the sole purpose of supporting the restaurant that prepared it. It's like a tiny, free advertisement for a business that made something I really enjoyed. It's supportive because your friends will see the name of the restaurant/business as they scroll, even if they're too lazy to look at the comments (which a lot of people are), and also because if you have an account that is visible to anyone outside of your friend group, your post will show up when people are searching through what has been tagged at that location.", "He\u2019s a f boy.. He don\u2019t tag you because he don\u2019t want you on his page\u2026 the real question is why? Is he also overly private about his phone? He either cheating or just wants to appear single to keep his options open.", "He blocked you on his accounts. He's definitely hiding something, and he's been using an excuse of thinking it's cringe to share about his partner. Sorry sis.", "Still, I think it\u2019s suspicious he will post food always but nothing of his girlfriend, not even just tag your username", "Doesn't it sound like a red flag to you at all? And no it dosnt stop there does it, now he blocks you all over THAT..\n\nOn the other hand having IG and wanting absolute personal privacy is pretty much an oxymoron in my opinion the guy needs to quit his bs", "I don't think you should count on him to be honest with you. I think you should look at what's happening, what people are saying here and then decide. You need to watch out for yourself.", "I've added to my original comment. If you don't want your cooking posted without being credited, he needs to respect that. If he doesn't want you reposting his content, you need to respect that. Ultimately, the two of you need to have a mature and respectful conversation and reach an agreement.", "It bothered me that he didn\u2019t post me on his Instagram but I know it\u2019s his Instagram so he can do whatever he wants with it (as long as he isn\u2019t harming anyone). So I let that pass. But the point is that if he\u2019s going to post my food that I made and not show support by a simple tag on his story then I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t feel supported at all then. I\u2019m trying to do a meal prepping business and need more engagement on my account.", "And he didn't stop at not supporting you, he doubles down on it and blocks you. Are you sure he's your boyfriend? But yeah, maybe for you it's just this annoyance of not being supported by your boyfriend, but we all find the whole wider picture extremely questionable to the least and I personally find that pretty sad.", "Yes, I think this is less about the social media protocol and more about you feeling unsupported. He has wiped you from any public facing output.", "Don't cook for him. Easy peasy solution to your problem.", "NTA and who blocks the person they live with on all their media? Something is seriously off here. OP, you need to really look at the relationship and what else he is doing or not doing.", "ESH", "ESH. You can ask, he can say no. Should he? Maybe. Does he have to? No. If he\u2019s blocked you on all socials. It\u2019s over girl.", "Has he told you influences are idiots? Maybe that's why he doesn't want to tag you, because they are. YTA for requiring it.", "This is very weird, but is it possible that this is the boyfriend's immature way of resisting the OP's preference to commodify her social interactions?", "Girl.... He's probably cheating. Start taking very lovey dovey photos and then suddenly post them taking him as your BF. Best is to add \"x year anniversary\"... So the other girls also know. Then plan to break up and ghost him (complete ghosting is more painful then just breaking up)\n\nNAH for the question though. It's unkind and unsupportive of him not to tag you but I also feel that people can't be forced to do so", "NTA. Update us on the ex.", "How many red flags do you still want to collect? \nNTA. But you are the asshole to yourself by still staying with someone who clearly doesn't care about you or your work. Does he even like you?", "That\u2019s not the issue. Bf is taking dinner pictures on his own phone for his own account. It\u2019s not like OP is taking photos of it and sending him them right?", "She\u2019s not an \u201cinfluencer\u201d\u2014she has a small business as a meal planner/prepper that she\u2019s trying to grow. Everyone conducts and grows small businesses on the internet in the year of lord 2023. And that\u2019s super different than being essentially paid for being chronically online.", "I\u2019m sorry to say but you might not be getting it that he\u2019s trying to hide you. Reasoning with him might not work because he likely knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s showing his true colors. Run from this relationship.", "Honestly, this smacks of something a little sneakier than just he won\u2019t tag you in his stories when he posts your food. When dudes don\u2019t want to tag their girlfriends on social media it\u2019s because they are hiding the fact that they have a girlfriend from someone.", "Yes, you should be with someone that makes you feel supported and appreciated!", "Not just immature, shady as shit. He\u2019s hiding you, and you deserve to live a life without shady people in it.", "He\u2019s not acting.", "So he *has* an Instagram account, he just doesn't want you connected with it in any way? \n\nNot gonna lie, that makes me think you're the dirty little secret.", "My bad then.  I thought he was reposting her photos .", "Blocking you is an extreme reaction to what happened.  He's hiding something.", "Ah yes, so cringe to publicly acknowledge the existence of someone who is supposed to be one of the most important people in your life.", "He probably has another IG that you don\u2019t know about. \n\nYou could probably find it if you look at his followers and start looking at their followers. Def check his besties profiles."]}
