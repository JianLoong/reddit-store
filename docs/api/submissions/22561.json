We exchanged our actual phone numbers he asked me out and I was happy to meet up with him.\n\nWe got dinner and when we were waiting to be seated, I know this sounds super shallow, but I realized his teeth were gross. Like yellow and smelled bad and he looked like his pics, but he wasn't open-mouthed in any of them so I didn't know. I was so immediately turned off and knew I was not interested in a second date.\n\nHe also just wasn't that good of a conversationalist and at the end of the meal, he offered to pay and I made a half-hearted effort to pay for my portion but he was like, \"no I'll get it,\" and I let him. Then I went home and sent him a text telling him I didn't want anything more with him and he sent me, \"And you really let me pay? Dick move.\" \n\nI asked one of my male friends if it really is wrong to let a guy pay when you know you're not interested and he said it kind of does get expensive to pay for dates and I should have split it once I knew there was nothing else on the table for us.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm guessing that, in the moment, you couldn't think of a reason to *insist* on paying other than \"oh, I don't want to date you, so I should pay.\" So you kinda froze. That's a bad judgment call. \n\nSince this forum is kinda black and white, YTA for the situation,  but I don't think you're an actual asshole or even a bad person. \n\nIn the future, you should establish going dutch when arranging the date. This will prevent this exact situation.\n\nThe arm-chair-quarterbacks saying you should have tried harder to pay are correct; but I can understand how, in the awkwardness that was playing out in real-time, you fumbled the play.

No, you did nothing wrong. he just needed something to find about you that he could attack and that was the only thing. \n\nYou offered to split, he offered to do the patriarchal thing.

Or what if you just wanted to pay half and he REALLY insisted, being REALLY pushy about the whole manly man thing. \n\nIt was a lose lose situation. Men don't handle rejection well.

You offered to pay your half and as the friend whose had to pick up friends who turned down guys in person it's not worth the risk. As much as it sucks a guy's expected to pay on the first date.

It happens a lot with online dating unfortunately :( In my opinion he's the asshole for insisting on paying and then guilt tripping you after the fact. Very rude and undignified of him. In my online dating days I felt uncomfortable about guys paying for meals when I wasn't attracted so I got around it by never going out for a meal on a first date; I would go out for drinks, let him buy the first round and then I would get the second round (or vice versa).

Also agree with your comment that it's not wise to reject someone in person, it's not worth jeopardising your safety if they react badly.", "Kind of, if you jump in and pay it's a subtle way of saying you aren't the one for me.

You maybe could've gone about it differently, but I don't think that makes you an asshole. You offered to pay your half and he waved you off.

It sucks, you feel like a fool, investing more into something than what the other party thought it was worth. \n\nThis is the risk you take when you ask someone off an app for a first date at a restaurant, and decide to offer to pay for it. When thats said, as a woman you can also suggest something else as a first meet-up. Just as there are men expecting to get their moneys worth, theres women expecting to get their \"time worth\", sort of speak. Thats why I never invite someone off an app for a date thats more expensive than a beer. It easily filters away people that are in it for the wrong reasons, and leaves people who are generally interested in getting to know you. Although ive never been in women's shoes here, I suspect that most of these men will serve up some BS about wanting to show her a good time.

If you genuinely think he is not like that, then fair enough, but otherwise you are just using it as a cheap excuse.

As the enamel errodes (as it tends to do with any acidic, sugary, very hot or very cold foods or drinks) more of the dentin underneath begins to show, and dentin is naturally yellow-ish.\n\nThat said, it's different if the guy had obviously really yellow teeth and bad breath which makes it seem like he just didn't brush which is insanitary and gross. But the average person's teeth aren't bright white.", "i think you went into this one with a bias lmao nobody really did anything that bad", "i mean when you go on dates sometimes the other person might be more into you, it says nothing in post about expecting a second date but honestly isnt that the point of dating? to get more dates lol? in my experiences if a girl doesnt like me she usually is open about wanting to split the bill", "She did.", "Have you never been on a date? Everyone is always insanely sweet on the first date, it's always perfection and a complete act. Guys act like dukes from a Jane Austen novel. So, when you are dating, that's what you do, you GO on a date, to meet them. Not for sex. To meet them. \n\nMost of the time the bill is split 50-50, because these are not the 1890s, unless the woman is actually just there for free food, or if the guy really really insists, almost willing to cause a scene - because he thinks this will get him laid - on the first date. \n\nThen, the first moment you say no to them, masks come off. \n\nSeriously, you've never been on a dinner date?", "\"talk to you soon\"?

Which again, some men take as \"emasculating\"? And for me, the point of a date is to see if we are compatible. If we aren't, there won't be a second date, or third or any number when I figure out they aren't for me.\nIf I asked them out, I'll still pay for it though. Even if they or I don't want a second (insert number here) one. Expectations that aren't agreed to, but just assumed are on the person making the assumption.", "In her own words it was half hearted. You're being disingenuous \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. She truly had no intention to pay. I know it. You know it. And she knows it.", "wow, are you seriously asking me to confirm your own fairytale?\n\nYou are coming off as more and more of an asshole, and the exact type of woman I am deliberately filtering out of my dating pool by making the first dates free, or cheap. My dates have been perfectly suitable, and enjoyable for me and the women I have taken them on, and I dont think any of us have felt the need to get your approval on how date-worthy the arrangement has been. It's filled the purpose we wanted for it, and even when it's not been anything we want to pursue, which normally is the case, we have left there in a decent en respectful way. \n\nBut just out of curiosity, have you ever reflected upon what you, yourself want to get out of these things, and how you could affect the outcome? If the sole purpose is to meet them, why go through all the effort of eating a dinner with them? Why sit through an entire two-faced meal with them? what purpose does does this serve? other then putting yourself in all of these uncomfortable situations with people who think they are owed sex?\n\nId suggest asking them for a coffee, a drink or a walk in the park in stead. It's quick and easy, both are free to go when they please, and theres no need to be two-faced in order to make a meal tolerable, or dread any expectations of sex due to having been bought dinner.", "Then let him know tomorrow. She could have easily just let him know the next day. \n\nI will talk to you tomorrow and (the next day). Don\u2019t think this would work for a second work just as well as rejecting that night.", "Yeah, in that case I understand it being a turn off. It's just annoying sometimes when people seem to expect ivory white teeth or they assume that yellowish=unclean.", "i dont even disagree with this but i think a big thing too is women usually dont ask men out, and there is a weird dynamic with gender roles sometimes on dates, i usually never have any issues though beefing over dates", "And that is how guys like you think and nothing will ever convince you that women aren't only dating you for food. Even if she did have her own money with her.", "How is this now about you? \n\nIf you treat women like human beings, this has nothing to do with you. What fairytale? That women are expected to put out to guys who pay for their food?", "Again, why would you prefer to be lied to? Why is tomorrow better than today?", "yeah i have a pretty banged up mouth from a childhood diet of nothing but sugar, but as long as hygiene is good ive never noticed anyone talking shit tbh, of course i mention im waiting on replacements too for the couple i had removed", "As a woman who dates all genders I prefer to do the asking out. It never made sense to me to only choose from people who preselected me. I prefer to do my own preselection, based on my standards and what I'm looking for. Gender roles aren't laws, youre allowed to say no and completely ignore them. Gods know I do. \nBut if we want to make it about gender roles; women are expected to spend more time and money on their makeup, clothes, accessories, etc when getting ready for a date. Men can usually show up freshly showered, in jeans and a t-shirt or shirt and possibly with their beard groomed or shaved(depending on place where the date is usually, and not the fact it's a date)", "If she has her own money with her, why didn't she pay? What reason can you give that doesn't just sound entitled and selfish AF? Serious question. We all know the societal norms. She even admitted that she had absolutely no intention of paying for herself. What is the purpose of having her own money, if she's just going to spend his anyway? What moral or ethical reason did she have for not paying for herself? Not even on any redpill slant or anything. Because to me what she did was gross AF. To me what she did was slimy. I have 4 sisters, no brothers, and I'm the youngest. I was raised primarily by women, and none of the women in my life would have done this, and if I would have told them this story from the perspective of OP's date, they would have told me that it was a red flag, and that I'd have dodged a bullet.", "Because it is?", "honestly thats why i go on dumb little fun first dates that dont cost alot of money or need people to dress to the nines or spend 3 hours getting ready, and some guys will 100% shave before going on a date regardless of the place, dudes arent a black n white topic just like women arent", "How so? Id find it dishonest and worse than being told the day of. Rejection is part of life. It shouldn't hurt for more than a second after a first date if you're an emotionally secure person.", "I said the expected gender roles. Not what everyone does.", "Honest I prefer casual dates for a first date too, because they're less commitment time wise and just easier. I do spend an hour getting ready for anything though, coz I'm a goth chick. \ud83d\ude02 But that's a personal choice coz I enjoy it."]}
