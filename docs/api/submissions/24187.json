I recently went to his hometown with him on two trips and met his friends, one of which is a girl we\u2019ll call Maggie.\n\nMaggie is married to Tom and she has known my boyfriend for 10 years. After hanging out with her, I really don't like her. \n\nHere's a list of things she did (in the order that they occurred) that didn't sit right with me in the two weekends I spent with her:\n\nWhen I found out we both work from home, I made a joke about how I like to lay on the floor when I do my work. Her reply to that was basically \u201cOh, well I actually WORK at my job, because I charge my clients $300 an hour.\u201d \n\nI was telling her that I think my boyfriend would like a WFH job and she said, \u201cHe we would NEVER do that, he\u2019s wayyyy too much of a busybody.\u201d I interpreted this as her insinuating that she knows him better than me.\n\nWhen I mentioned how much I love Hispanic culture, she chimed in immediately about how the border crisis is terrible and we need to stop illegal immigration. I just stared at her and then changed the subject.\n\nThe day after I met her, we all went to a wedding and were standing around chatting when she came up and threw her arms around my boyfriend and told him she loves him. When he didn\u2019t respond, she said \u201cWhy won\u2019t you say it back?\u201d And he did. I was right beside him.\n\nShe told me, \u201cYou have the most beautiful lips I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d I was so shocked to hear her say something like nice to me and felt like maybe I had misread her. Then she followed it up with, \u201cDo you get lip filler?\u201d Which I interpreted as her trying to out me for getting lip filler in front of everyone.\n\nAs soon as we got our drinks on a double date one night, Maggie asked to try my boyfriend's drink immediately and she gave him hers to try. They were sitting there commenting on the drinks and swapping back and forth while me and Tom just sat silently, staring off into space with our beers.\n\nWhen we went swimming once, Maggie kept telling my boyfriend she wanted to see him swim (he used to be a swimmer). When he swan for her, she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about what a \u201cpretty swimmer\u201d he is. When we got back to the house she got my boyfriend's attention and pulled her shorts way down her stomach and her shirt way up to reveal the most insignificant tan line I\u2019ve ever seen and was like \u201cLook at my tan line! Isn\u2019t this hilarious?\u201d And laughed. \n\nOverall, she mostly ignores me, focuses on talking to my boyfriend, and just doesn't seem to ever be genuinely trying to be friends with me.\n\nI told my boyfriend that I don\u2019t like the way that she treats me and he said she's just socially awkward and I'm jealous (even though I liked all his other female friends). I said I will give her one more chance, but if she\u2019s rude to mean again then I\u2019m never seeing her again.

Ultimatums are never a good idea, and being in a relationship always entails getting along with folks you\u2019d prefer not to have to, but if your bf can\u2019t see how disrespectful she is of you and your relationship and enforce some boundaries with her then it\u2019s him I\u2019d consider cutting loose.", "How long have you and your boyfriend know each other, and how long have you been dating?", "NTA.\n\nThis will get locked for Rule 11 so take it to the relationship subs.\n\nIf I had to guess, Maggie feels your boyfriend is \"the one that got away\" and still has feelings for him. It's a bit of a red flag that he puts his relationship with her over your feelings about how she behaved too. Be careful and make sure you have a backup plan to get out of there if it gets worse.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to address his friend's behavior. It's pretty shitty that you have a valid argument about his friend's inappropriate behavior and he just dismisses you as \"jealous\".\n\nIf he can't have a simple conversation with her, I'd damn sure not be moving my ass from sunny Florida to cold-ass Minnesota. Away from all my fam and friends.", "I think it's okay not to like her but doesn't mean he cant continue his friendship with her.

He does not respect your relationship enough to defend it to his friend.", "Tell your bf that any behaviour he lets her get away with you will absolutely match with your male friends, since he thinks it\u2019s perfectly acceptable and you\u2019re just being \u201cjealous\u201d, and see how quickly his attitude changes.\n\nAlso, practice getting comfortable with non-confrontationally drawing attention to other people\u2019s rude behaviour. Phrases like \u201cwhat an odd thing to say to someone you barely know!\u201d And \u201cwow, that was rude, did you mean it that way?\u201d Just said at a normal volume and tone work wonders for making people aware that you\u2019re not going to lower your boundaries when they push, without making the atmosphere uncomfortable.", "Gonna be an issue when you move. GL", "Maggie is *NOT* a girls girl", "NTA - you get to draw your own boundaries, but your boyfriend is definitely the bigger problem here. Relationships change friendships, so what was once okay to do may no longer be okay because it crosses boundaries you both have set. Your boyfriend doesn't seem to understand this and that's why you're now in this position.\n\nFor some people, the things Maggie did wouldn't violate any boundaries, but if you feel uncomfortable with the way she behaved with your boyfriend, then it's time to sit down and discuss the boundaries you'll both have with others while in a relationship with each other.\n\nIf you're not interested in ending the relationship should things get out of hand *and* your boyfriend is unwilling to change *and* you have to be around Maggie, for whatever reason, I would say treat it as open season to give her a dose of her own medicine.

But you seem to be making this in to a demand for your bf to choose between her and you, and that's needlessly aggressive.\n\nShe doesn't have to be your friend, either.

That's OK too.", "NTA shes clearly not socially awkward and besides being that close when both you and her boyfriend are there? But I guess give her another chance NTA but set boundaries after observin and giving that one more chance.\n\nTell your boyfriend to not match that energy as respect for you.

You just  stay polite and let her do her thing.\n\n>The only other solution I thought of is to start acting the way she acts towards my boyfriend to her husband\u2014which would actually be pretty funny \n\nThis would not be funny in any adult relationship. This would be you stirring shit. You've said very little about her interacting with your BF. And while I get that she makes you uncomfortable, her behavior has only been a bit dramatic or self-centered. Not egregious. Take a step back and stop trying to make this situation worse than it is.", "Agreed.  Its not that she wants him, it's that she wants the OP to know that she could have him if she wanted to and that she is always going to come first.
