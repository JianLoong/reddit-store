It was walking distance, about a mile away from our unit. I remember it being advertised but didn't go.\n\nWell, to put it plainly, she got spat on by a camel. She texted me shortly after it happened to \"warn\" me and that she was coming home. I thought, okay, what's the big deal, come home.\n\nI saw her coming up the steps, looking miserable, through the window and went out to the porch to greet her, and instantly I was hit with the most unbelievably vile smell I've ever smelled, from a good 20 feet away. I really couldn't take it, I got only a whiff and I could feel my stomach churning.\n\nI went back inside and closed the door. She came up and tried to get inside with her key but I was practically begging her \"No, whatever happened you can't come in like that.\" She was yelling \"What, I live here!\" and then was practically crying that she had nowhere else to go. I said I'm sorry but there's no way, I can't let that smell in here, I could smell her through the door, I was gagging. \n\nI suggested that she find a hose, or shower somewhere, or jump in a creek, or something, anything but coming in like that, but she was saying no store would let her in...\n\nBut I held firm. I held the door closed until she walked away. She came back an hour later soaking wet (maybe she had jumped in a creek) and opened the door (I couldn't just sit there holding it shut all day), and the smell was maybe barely better but still horrific. She jumped straight into the shower, but I can still faintly smell it throughout our whole living room and it's making me feel absolutely sick.\n\nNow we're both furious at each other. I'm mad that she came back in before the smell was gone and now the whole place smells unbearable. She's furious that I dared to hold the door shut and keep her out and is saying that she'll be talking to the landlord or a lawyer because that can't be legal, but I don't know what else I could have done, this is dreadful.\n\nAITA?\n\ntl;dr held the door shut to prevent apartment-mate from coming in stinking to high heaven", "created_utc": 1686122068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14368d8/aita_for_not_letting_my_apartmentmate_21f_back/", "score": 5123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where the heck do you expect her to clean herself up if she can't even get into her own apartment? Yes! HER apartment. She pays rent. It's hers for the duration.

Home is where you get cleaned, if you don\u2019t have yard and hose that was a ridiculous ask", "Of course YTA. No question about it. She lives there.

Way to make her feel inferior jfc.", "YTA\n\nYou should never have blocked her out.\n\nI cannot imagine being in that situation and not helping. Taking her clothes and trashing them (or washing I guess). Opening all windows and running fans in to air things out.

It's batshit crazy.", "YTA and even worse bc you don't get what you did wrong......she took a shower, the smell was gone. But your stench will never go away. I hope she does go to the police.", "YTA, and you owe her a month\u2019s rent because apparently just you live there and she\u2019s a guest.", "YTA. She lives there, she pays rent to you,  she didn't want to get spat on and stink to high heaven, she let you know in advance. What more do you want from her? I can only imagine the inconvenience with the smell and everything but your ask was completely unreasonable.

Better take it back and patch things up with her before she plays hardball.", "I'm going to say this as gently as possible. OP, she was coming home to clean herself up. If you had let her clean up, the smell wouldn't have been as bad. Presumably you had the option of sticking to the bedroom while she was showering. What you did was immoral at best, and may very well be illegal - it could very well be grounds for you to get evicted, if she decides to go that route. You not only did a bad thing, you also very likely made the problem worse, as several people have described.  \n\n\nYTA. Obviously and clearly, and the fact that you can't see that yourself is concerning at best.", "Oh my god. Yes, yes YTA.\n\nit's her home, where her shower and clothes are.\n\nWhat would make you think your behaviour was acceptable?", "I\u2019m not a violent person but I want to be violent right now and have to control my words or I\u2019ll get banned.\n\nHOW DARE YOU!! \n\nYTA! You are the worst AH! You should be required to pay damages to her. I hope she shames you to everyone in your life because you deserve it. I don\u2019t even think there is a way to make this up to her. And I hope she has a safe place to go because I would not trust you with anything now! \n\nShe went somewhere to clean it off, she went home!! Guess what that is what she was meant to do. If you couldn\u2019t handle the smell then leave! But expecting her to wash off somewhere else enough to not smell is not possible! And could have been super dangerous for her. \n\nI hope she tells all your friends and family what a AH you are", "YTA and a big one. Altough I did chuckle at imagining her jumping in the creek. You Satan.", "I feel terrible for this roommate. Imagine the embarrassment of walking a mile home covered in camel vomit and the relief of *finally* being about to get home and then your roommate does this? And *then* you\u2019re locked out of your house and left to\u2026 wander around while this shit is solidifying on you and in your hair?

Yes, YTA. Burn some candles or essential oil or whatever, but imagine that happened to you. Just put the shoe on the other foot and imagine how you'd feel in her position.", "You are the worst. She was hurt and vulnerable and you managed to lock herself out of her home in that state. YTA.", "YTA jfc. She's clearly in an awful situation and selfishly keeping her from entering her home on top of that is just cruel. She desperately needed to get inside to clean and you prevented her from doing it.

What a horrible thing to do to someone.", "YTA Think if this situation if you ever get covered in some vile smelling stuff", "YTA. Leave the fucking house and let her clean it off quickly? Don't be so cruel. Or better yet, suck it up and quit being such a baby. Hold your breath, do what it takes, she lives there as you do.", "YTA you could have opened all the windows to vent the smell and opened internal doors so she had a straight run to the bathroom but she had every right to enter and get cleaned up.
