She had every right to get into HER house. You suck", "YTA, a huge one. She should have called the police (I certainly would have done it)", "YTA, That was not only deeply inconsiderate but also illegal. I cant believe you put that poor woman through that, for fucks sake you could have just opened up the windows and sprayed the place with Lysol or picked up an odor cleaner. What the hell?", "She lives there, pays for rent and you decided not to let her in for AN HOUR while she was in HUGE distress, outside, alone, probably making her jump in a creek?\nETA: YTA by the way, just trying to determine how much of an AH.", "YTA\nYou could have met her at the door with clean clothes to put on before she came in to shower, or a robe and a clean garbage bag to put the nasty clothes in.\nOr met her at a laundromat. \nYou can get inexpensive air cleaners.

She should complain to the landlord and kick you out or file a police report on you. YTA for being an air hogger.", "YTA. She should have called the police. You had no right to do that.", "YTA. Of course you're TA. Locking her out when she was already suffering was awful. You say the smell made you feel sick, well what do you think it was doing to her being covered in it?", "YTA. It\u2019s her house too and she has the right to go there and take a shower asap to wash the smell off herself. If you couldn\u2019t stand the smell you should have been the one to leave the house and go for a walk while she is taking shower and washing her clothes. Then you could open the windows and doors to let some fresh air into the apartment. Locking her out of the house is not only mean but most likely illegal. It\u2019s not like she purposely covered herself in camel\u2019s spit to get on your nerves. She was suffering from that smell way more than you, how the hell do you have so little empathy that you managed to make yourself a victim in the situation where you were the bully?", "YTA. I can\u2019t even comprehend how someone could do this to their roommate coming back to their own home. \n\n\nGet her a towel, grab some trash bags and have her change if it was too much trouble to open the bloody door and windows to air the place out \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "YTA\nWhy should she need to go somewhere else to shower, SHE LIVES THERE.

Where the heck do you expect her to clean herself up if she can't even get into her own apartment? Yes! HER apartment. She pays rent. It's hers for the duration.

Was you born evil or is there a class you can take? She would've been fully within her right to call police coz yes that is illegal. Just hold your nose and open windows and let the woman shower.

Man I wouldnt be surprised if she moved out after this", "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?! YTA.. I agree with every other YTA statement on here.", "YTA.  There were so many ways that you could\u2019ve helped her yourself even if you didn\u2019t want her to come inside.

I don't know, you could have acted like the adult you claim to be at 21 years old and suck up a bad smell for the maybe 20 minutes it'd take her to shower. Then, and this bit is shocking, you could have opened a window without demanding she jump in a creek! \n\nYour sense of smell is your own problem, but it pales in comparison to the trouble you might be in with your landlord and/or a lawyer. \nI sure hope holding that door shut was worth it.", "YTA \n\nI don't know if you know, but she lives there.

That was literally the only solution you could come up with was to make her feel worse?

Home is where you get cleaned, if you don\u2019t have yard and hose that was a ridiculous ask", "Of course YTA. No question about it. She lives there. She needed to bathe in her home and you physically barred her and made her already vulnerable state worse by telling her to wash off with a hose or a creek. Way to make her feel inferior jfc.", "YTA\n\nYou should never have blocked her out.\n\nI cannot imagine being in that situation and not helping. Taking her clothes and trashing them (or washing I guess). Opening all windows and running fans in to air things out.

It sound like you only let her in the second was because you couldn\u2019t hold the door all day. \nYTA", "This can't be real.\nIf it is real, how could you actually expect anyone to agree with you? It's batshit crazy.", "YTA and even worse bc you don't get what you did wrong......she took a shower, the smell was gone. But your stench will never go away. I hope she does go to the police.", "YTA, and you owe her a month\u2019s rent because apparently just you live there and she\u2019s a guest.", "YTA. She lives there, she pays rent to you,  she didn't want to get spat on and stink to high heaven, she let you know in advance. What more do you want from her? I can only imagine the inconvenience with the smell and everything but your ask was completely unreasonable. Nobody nearby's going to take her in and where would she even be able to change her clothes? Or get clothes to change into since you won't let her in and all? Better take it back and patch things up with her before she plays hardball.", "I'm going to say this as gently as possible. OP, she was coming home to clean herself up. If you had let her clean up, the smell wouldn't have been as bad. Presumably you had the option of sticking to the bedroom while she was showering. What you did was immoral at best, and may very well be illegal - it could very well be grounds for you to get evicted, if she decides to go that route. You not only did a bad thing, you also very likely made the problem worse, as several people have described.  \n\n\nYTA. Obviously and clearly, and the fact that you can't see that yourself is concerning at best.", "Oh my god. Yes, yes YTA.\n\nit's her home, where her shower and clothes are.\n\nWhat would make you think your behaviour was acceptable?", "I\u2019m not a violent person but I want to be violent right now and have to control my words or I\u2019ll get banned.\n\nHOW DARE YOU!! \n\nYTA! You are the worst AH! You should be required to pay damages to her. I hope she shames you to everyone in your life because you deserve it. I don\u2019t even think there is a way to make this up to her. And I hope she has a safe place to go because I would not trust you with anything now! \n\nShe went somewhere to clean it off, she went home!! Guess what that is what she was meant to do. If you couldn\u2019t handle the smell then leave! But expecting her to wash off somewhere else enough to not smell is not possible! And could have been super dangerous for her. \n\nI hope she tells all your friends and family what a AH you are", "YTA and a big one. Altough I did chuckle at imagining her jumping in the creek. You Satan.", "I feel terrible for this roommate. Imagine the embarrassment of walking a mile home covered in camel vomit and the relief of *finally* being about to get home and then your roommate does this? And *then* you\u2019re locked out of your house and left to\u2026 wander around while this shit is solidifying on you and in your hair?

Yes, YTA. Burn some candles or essential oil or whatever, but imagine that happened to you. Just put the shoe on the other foot and imagine how you'd feel in her position.", "You are the worst. She was hurt and vulnerable and you managed to lock herself out of her home in that state. YTA.", "YTA jfc. She's clearly in an awful situation and selfishly keeping her from entering her home on top of that is just cruel. She desperately needed to get inside to clean and you prevented her from doing it.

What a horrible thing to do to someone.", "YTA Think if this situation if you ever get covered in some vile smelling stuff", "YTA. Leave the fucking house and let her clean it off quickly?
