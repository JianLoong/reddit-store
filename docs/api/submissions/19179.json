A smell will go away but your relationship will not survive this. \n\nWhen I lived with roommates, my dog got sprayed by a skunk late at night.

No washing off. No coming back inside until you get the stink off. Show her you're willing to see how it feels, and maybe she'll forgive you.

You can't just stop someone from coming into where they live. Come on.\n\nI do sympathize though, ugh. I know that stench. Never from a camel, but from an alpaca which is probably just as bad.

Was definitely gross but not smelly.", "Have any of you ever smelled that stuff?? It's not exactly \"spit...\"\n\nNAH, I'm sorry but there can't be an obligation to subject yourself to that olfactory torture.

I get that the smell was horrendous, but you can't deny her entry because of that. She's a paying tenant and it was a one time incident. It's not like she's purposefully making the place smell all the time.\n\nLike where did you expect her to wash.

Locking someone out of their own home while they\u2019re suffering from being covered in a stench *that* bad?? You had options. You could\u2019ve left until she got cleaned up.
