Stalls are not reserved *only* for wheelchair use; they are there to accommodate those in wheelchairs (or other mobility/accessibility needs). Think of it like a wheelchair ramp into a building. Everyone can use it. You wouldn't yell at someone for walking up the ramp. NTA  \n\n\n(edited for typo)", "NTA. I feel like this can be tough, and something I've always wondered. Can't wait to see what everyone else thinks. But my two cents, unless the stall specifically says \"Reserved for Handicapped/Needs/Etc\" it's not an exclusive stall. While it would be great to have stalls always put aside, there can only be so many toilets in a bathroom. What's most important is that the accomodations are available for those that need it, but it's not usually reserved. By the same logic, you shouldn't ever use a ramp to walk into a building.", "NTA. He was irritated before he even knew if the person in the stall was handicap or not", "NTA\n\nMany bathrooms have a larger accessible stall and a few smaller ones. There is no requirement to leave the accessible stall empty just in case a person who requires it happens to come in. It's \"wheelchair accessible\" and not \"wheelchair only\".\n\nSure - if there's another one free, use that in preference, but nobody ever waits for a \"normal\" stall when the accessible stall is vacant - they just use that, and this is the intended behavior.\n\nYour colleague got upset because he had to wait for the only stall he could use, while there was a smaller one open. He can't have been waiting all that long.", "NTA. It wasn't about YOU, it was just the fact that someone was in that stall when he now needed it. It's not like you purposefully took it and looked him in the eye as you did saying \"Nanana-boo boo\". How were you to know he would come in at the moment he did? You didn't. He felt entitled. That's not your problem.", "I totally support giving accessible accommodation and priority when available to those who need it\u2026. However nobody should be exempt from waiting their turn once in a while. NTA", "Handicap stalls are there for assuring a person in a wheel chair can use it. And if it\u2019s occupied they can wait like anybody else would have to wait to use a standard stall. The bladder wants what the bladder needs. NTA.  Guess what? Some needs to bars to use to stay safe that aren\u2019t in wheel chairs. For years I have read here and there where many think that a handicap stall is off limits to somebody who isn\u2019t. Accessible, not exclusive to wheel chairs. Urine in the right mind set with this issue.", "NTA. It's handicap accessible not handicap only", "NTA. When the handicap stall is the only option you have, then that's that.  You shouldn't have to risk soiling yourself on the off chance that an actual disabled person is going to come along and need that stall, because you most likely have no way of knowing that.  You were just very unlucky in this case from the sound of it.", "NTA. You were faced with a situation, dealt with it. Your decision wasn't intended to inconvenience him and I'm surprised he was already mad without knowing yet who's in the handicap stall ( *Then I hear someone pulling at my door and say \"unbelievable!\u2019*). Overall, his frustration is understandable, but it doesn't make you the asshole in this scenario.", "NTA. Handicapped stalls aren't for the exclusive use of the handicapped. They're included in the count of stalls required for the building when it's built, meaning, they calculate the total numbers of stalls needed for the number of people that will use the building, then designate a certain number of them as accessible. If only handicapped people use those stalls, then there aren't enough non-handicapped stalls in the building.\n\nI do think handicapped people should jump to the front of the line for the handicapped stalls, if there is a line, but otherwise those stalls should be in the regular rotation.", "NTA at all.  If the stall is unoccupied and/or there isn't a mobility disabled person waiting on it, it's free for anyone.", "NTA Just because you are not visibly handicapped does not mean you aren't. Some people have issues where they need the hold bar to help get up and down from the seated position.", "NTA. I would say that I have crohns and could bot wait.", "NTA. There's no way this is the first time this person has had to wait for a stall. Everything you did sounds completely reasonable, and you don't owe him an explanation.", "NTA", "NTA. Handicap stalls aren't like handicap parking spaces. You were within your rights to use it. A lot of people have reason to use them.

Additionally, some people who appear to be able-bodied may have a hidden disability that necessitates the use of the accessible stall, and the accessible stalls are not limited to use by those with visible disabilities (although I understand that is not the circumstance here). While I certainly get that this gentlemen may have wished the accessible stall had been available, you were not prohibited from using that stall - particularly as no other stall was available - and you are NTA", "NTA but I wouldn't have continued after the \"I don't have to justify my bowel movements to you \" I would have stopped there, washed my hands and left him. Because your business ain't his business.", "NTA. The accessible stall is available for those who need it, not exclusively reserved for them. You got to the bathroom first.", "Not all handicaps are visible and for anyone to assume your needs, they are the asshole.", "If he works there, everybody should try to never use it so it's available for him. But NTA.", "Like 15 years ago at a place I worked, I knew an diabetic that had to inject as needed, he had a little kit and mat and sanitizer, would go into the accessibility stall, sanitize the sink, roll out a mat on the sink and put his kit down. Had a similar situation as op happen. The wheelchair person and him clashed a few times, the diabetic never specifically said why he was in there but insisted to the wheelchair user that he had a medical need. Well the wheelchair user complained to their manager and after nothing was resolved went to HR, HR handled it poorly, the diabetic got let go, for insisting he had a medical need but never specifying why. He sued the company and they settled. \n\nI on the other hand had IBS and GERDS for a period of time after the diabetic was let go and I had a DR\u2019s note and FLMA and HR & my manager knew and I discussed the possibility of clashing with the wheelchair user, my manager advised me to tell the guy to report me to HR if he had a problem with me using the restroom if the other was occupied. I never had the confrontation but I was prepared to vomit on command(gerds can be like that) if he ever gave me grief. \n\nDisabilities come in many forms and if a building has many floors and many restrooms someone with ibs or gerds or chrons may have a greater need\u2026", "NTA. Accessible means physically accessible, not unoccupied.", "NTA.  The stalls are there for everyone to use.  It's not a handicapped only stall.  It's there for if a handicapped person needs to use it.  But if the small stall is occupied it is reasonable to use the handicapped stall.   That man for some reason believes that ONLY handicapped ppl can use it, & that would be incorrect.  You did nothing wrong.  Those stalls usually have changing tables in there too, so mother's can change their babies.  The stall is for everyone.", "So agree! Handicap stalls are accessible, not reserved.  Use them as you need to. \nIn theory, a handicapped person should also have to 'wait in line' if there is a line, but I admit I would defer to them  unless I was leaking lol.", "Well said. And just to add, I give it the second try rule. If I enter the bathroom and the only stall open is the handicap one, I\u2019ll try the other bathroom on my floor. In this case, the other one wasn\u2019t an option so I went for it.", "When a building is made, they decide how many bathrooms fit their needs. Ada then tell them how many need to be accessible. But, the number still counts as part of the overall number so if they say they need 10, it's 10 assuming all bathrooms are used by everyone.", "Gave you a downvote like everyone else, but your reply reminds me of how many people who have handicapped cards because they have to ferry a disabled relative will nonchalantly say \"oh, I use the spot even when handicap Mom *isn't* in the car. I deserve it because of the extra work *I* put in, taking her around.\"", "I hope you get fined big. It's what you deserve.", "NTA. You're entirely right. A, you don't need to justify your bowel movement's urgency to him, and b, if he has time to sit there and bitch he had time to go to another bathroom himself.", "NTA.  The handicap stalls are not exclusively for use by those who are handicapped.  How did he know that you don't have a handicap yourself?", "I work in a mall and I had the unmitigated audacity to use the Family Bathroom. Some old guy yelled at me as I was closing the door but I ignored him. I saw him again later and he starts going off on me for using the \u2018handicapped\u2019 bathroom. I laughed and told him I\u2019m a disabled veteran! I will treasure the look on his face for many years to come!!!", "NTA, the same arguments the handicapped person used for you applied to them as well. Only difference is you got there first.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a parking spot, it\u2019s a stall. Ain\u2019t no law saying you can\u2019t use it.\n\nIt\u2019s also the most likely stall to have baby changing table.\n\nDude can stick it.", "First come, first served. It sucks when one has a more urgent need than the other, but that's life. It's going to happen. NTA and neither is the person who was upset since needing to go and not being able would be distressing for anyone.", "NTA. I\u2019m disabled, but not a wheelchair user. When I \u201cget caught short\u201d like you when out (rarely) - I need the extra space in the accessible toilet to do what I need to do: I have an ileostomy, and if my bag leaks, I literally have to strip to my underwear to change the bag and clean myself up\u2026 it\u2019s not easy in one of the standard sized cubicles - which, I should add, I do use when I don\u2019t have a bag leak all down my trousers and leg.", "NTA - when you gotta go you gotta go.", "NTA. Invisible disabilities exist and that guy can\u2019t get mad at every person he sees leave that stall just bc they don\u2019t have mobility aids.

I use handicap stalls all the time, and even when handicapped people come after me they never care. He\u2019s making a big deal out of nothing", "Not to mention that lots of people have invisible disabilities or other conditions that mean they need urgent access at times. My friend has IBS and when she gotta go, she gotta go, she can't hold it in. She doesn't look like she needs accommodations but her gut would disagree.\n\nNTA OP. That toilet was accessible, not reserved for his sole use.", "> *He was irritated before he even knew if the person in the stall was handicap or not*\n\nThis is a really good point.
