Alex has had a rough time since. He had come out to us and his school mates as gay just a little while before he got the news that we were moving, so it was particularly hard for him. He had found a solid support system and felt safe where we lived before. That was taken away with this move.\n\nThe place we live now, while still in the US, is less accepting. Alex has made a few friends but despite us being here for a year, he still hasn't really gotten comfortable here. Marie, on the other hand, really loves it and has been excelling at this new school thanks to clicking better with her teachers this year.\n\nThe move did cause some tension between my wife and I even before we made a decision. I know there's no easy time to move, but doing so during the transition between middle school and high school (arguably the most awkward time of a person's life) felt like a cruel punishment for our son to endure. My wife said it would make things easier since he would be starting a new school either way.\n\nI feel like my wife has been very unsympathetic to what our son is going through. A few weeks ago, we found weed in his room. While I was full prepared to 1. make sure he wasn't self-medicating in a way that could lead somewhere dangerous and 2. give him the 'don't be stupid, don't drive under the influence and don't stink up your room anymore' talk, his mom grounded him for two weeks and took away his phone every afternoon after school. This cut him off from his friends from his old school, further isolating him during an already hard time.\n\nThis brings us to last week. I finally sat my wife down and told her things weren't working. We gave it a try for a year, but Alex has consistently expressed his unhappiness and discomfort to us. I told her it was time to start making plans to go back. She said that Marie was doing great here and that I always favored Alex as 'the baby of the family,' and that we needed to give things more time. She also said both kids would be off to college soon.\n\nI replied that I wasn't willing to let my son live in discomfort for three more years before college. Also, my job and money I had gotten from my grandparents (a trust fund of sorts) more than covers our living expenses and there's no real NEED for her to work. I said it was incredibly selfish to put a passion project ahead of her own child, and that being a parent meant sometimes putting our \"needs\" on the backburner while we do what's best for them.\n\nShe was furious that I called her career a passion project and hasn't spoken to me since. I'm at a loss how to move forward.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT for clarification: I don\u2019t expect her to stop working or to be financially dependent on me. She could still work back in our home state (I would want her to, I\u2019m glad it makes her happy!) but she doesn\u2019t want to go back since it was essentially be a \u201cdemotion\u201d and a drop in her salary - which is extra money that we don\u2019t need anyway.", "created_utc": 1676751080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115oyj6/aita_for_calling_my_wifes_career_choice_a_passion/", "score": 2153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you think moving back will be a magic bullet for your son? Teendom isn\u2019t easy for anyone. You don\u2019t know if his support system would\u2019ve held in the transition to high school.\n\nI suspect that you were happier before the move. You seem to resent your wife\u2019s job, and you likely resent the time her job takes away from you. You probably also like the power that comes from controlling all of the money. Moving back is what you want for you, and the bonus is that Alex seemed happier there, too. \n\nYou two need counseling both for your marriage and on how help Alex through adolescence.", "I really feel like this is something you all should discuss with a therapist instead of a bunch of randos on Reddit \n\nEither way though, you need to consider everyone feelings and emotions, not just Alex\u2019s. Calling your wife\u2019s career choice as a \u201cpassion project\u201d is kinda insensitive. Like does she make an income off it?

Many people for good reason are uncomfortable being financially dependent on a spouse. Many people derive a meaning beyond just money from their job.

It creates problems for one child & solves problems for the other.  \n\nAs to what your family should do, that\u2019s hard to say.

That's a dick move.\n\nHave you tried counseling for your son?

First, you capitalized the word \"NEED\".  Maybe your wife does \\*NEED\\* to work for her to live a life worth living.  Next, you are the AH because you think you can solve all of your child's problems.  Struggle builds character.  It sounds like you are able to provide the basics for your kids, which is great.  That means they can take risks, try new things, experience life in different ways than a lot of kids get to.  Now help them be adults by allowing them to struggle if they are in a moment in time where they are struggling.  Completely upending your life (again) to fix a problem that time will probably solve is not a good solution.  Also, your other kid, as you said, is doing great in the new location.  Be good to her too.", "YTA. It was demeaning of you to dismiss her working as a \"passion project.\"\n\nIt also sounds like you're prioritizing the feelings of your son over your daughter, who you say is doing well in your new home.\n\nA friend of mine lost his high school-aged son to drugs a few years ago, so I don't think your wife's punishment of your son was too harsh.\n\nYou now seem split; wife and daughter want to stay, husband and son want to leave. I don't know how this can be resolved because either decision to going to lead to resentment. Counseling/therapy is the only thing I can suggest.", "Ok, that comment was 100% YTA\n\nbut your worrying about your son is completely understandable. You said that the move created tension between you and your wife even before it happened.\nIs there a reason why you accepted it in the first place? Is there any family around? Is your wife okay with your son being gay? You said your wife has been unsympathetic of what your son is going through: did she do anything else that made you feel this way?", "Yeah, YTA.  You clearly don't think of your spouse as an equal partner, and as long as that remains the case, YTA.", "Your math is terrible.

Your teenager isn't broken. They experimented with drugs. They are adjusting to a new place. It's not a crisis it's normal. Let them adjust. \n\nYou're a huge AH.", "Yeah dude, YTA. Who are you to say it's a \"passion project\" and treat her job like it means nothing? It's also an AH move to uproot your family when your wife and daughter are happy. Have you tried actually getting involved in your son's life? Also, odds are that moving back won't fix anything because now he'll have to RE-transition back into the old neighborhood.", "YTA.\n\n>She was furious that I called her career a passion project and hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nLook, there are few things that are more harmful to an adult's health than someone who wants to work not working. Homemakers and gainfully employed people alike don't fall into depression and substance abuse as quickly and easily as unemployed people because they are doing something of service that helps them feel useful. So my question is, why is her \"passion\" to be useful to the wider world more important than your \"passion\" to be useful to your family?\n\nYour statement to your wife, aside from being deeply personally insulting, is emasculating and threatening death to her well-being. Your reasons are irrelevant. Find another way.\n\nWith respect to your son's parenting, I am more disturbed by your (both of you) inability to be happy with each other's styles than by either one of yours individually. Children need both nurturing and limits so they can solve problems on their own. Your son should not have smoked marijuana in the first place and he must learn more control over his own decisions, or he will not get what he wants (phone time). What your wife is trying to teach your son is how to master his own choices, in the environment he is currently in. On its own that will not work, but neither will you trying to give him support (or more accurately, a brand new environment) in response to his poor choices.", "You both are TA. You're parents of a gay kid, and you didn't bother to do any research about the location beforehand??? Just because straight people can move wherever they want and be fine doesn't mean your son will be. \n\nThere are plenty of maps online that tell you what the state of LGBTQ rights are. You could have called or emailed the Trevor Project and asked them for a list of the best cities for LGBTQ youth. And then compared that to places your wife would have been able to work in her field.\n\nBoth of you failed to protect your son and take his basic safety needs into account. When LGBTQ kids are in an unsafe environment, they are more likely to do worse in school and make unsafe life choices. It's documented over and over. By LGBTQ groups and the CDC. \n\nGet your shit together. Stop blaming your son for trying to cope with hostile environments, and realize you two are most of the problem. Learn about local resources. Take him to and from youth group or PFLAG meetings if there's nothing else.", "YTA- have you actually looked for resources to help your son in your area?", "On the \u201cpassion project\u201d front, YTA. Very invalidating to call a woman\u2019s career that and imply that she could just stay home for the sake of children. Just because it\u2019s financially possible, doesn\u2019t mean that is what has to be done. \n\nHOWEVER, that being said. There is a problem at hand. That I don\u2019t think either of you are the assholes for. One of your children is going through something, and it should be discussed between the two of you. Moving can be really difficult for kids, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean to immediately move back, especially if the oldest is close to graduating. I think more needs to be done than just letting it be and \u201cgiving it time\u201d after a year of discomfort for Alex, but before doing the extreme of moving again, more solutions and options should be sought after. Therapy? Extra curricular activities? Maybe open up communication with Alex to see what he thinks could help. \n\nBest of luck with your kid.", "Your concern for Alex's wellbeing is admirable and you've picked up he's struggling which perhaps your wife has overlooked or not given enough credence to.  Also, you're not necessarily wrong about parental sacrifice although that comes down to \"where reasonable.\"\n\nThat being said, as soon as you referred to your wife's career as a passion project, that's basically devalued her own aspirations.  Going to take a lot of back-pedalling on that one and I hope it's not your genuine view.\n\nESH.  I think you definitely need to find a way to remove your foot from your mouth but perhaps your wife would do well to give more credence to Alex's struggles.", "YTA because you clearly look at people and approach your relationships with them as a cost benefit analysis.  You are completely disregarding that your daughter and wife experiencing success and fulfillment in their school in work should be completely negated because your son is in an understandably hard and awkward time in his life.  \n\nYou need to find a way to put your effort into supporting your son not dragging the rest of the family down to his level.", "Well well well, aren't you just patronising as all fuck?\n\nYTA and your backstory is completely irrelevant. For what's it's worth on that this issue will follow your kid. His ability to fit in and make friends isn't because of where he is. He's a 15 year old boy who happens to be gay. Being angsty about his place in the world and being socially awkward is par for the course. You are babying him.", "YTA- for phrasing it that way.  As someone who moved around a lot as a kid (dad was military) might I make a suggestion.  You and your son move back home, using your money.  Your wife and daughter stay there, using her money.  This way each child gets exactly what they need.", "ESH - The desire to be productive and work isn't a \"passion project\" and it's very dismissive and hurtful to call it that. You should be supportive of your partner's career and ambitions. Your wife isn't wrong that the bridge between middle and high school is actually one of the better times to move, precisely because so many people change schools and end up meeting so many new people when they enter high school. Your wife and you should be brainstorming ways to help your son find himself and find ways to be happier, but also, \"I'm unhappy and uncomfortable\" is pretty normal at that age, and you need to figure out how to be on the same page, parenting-wise, because you're showing pretty huge signs that you're not working together and you're not on the same page. You're being dismissive of her career and she's being dismissive of the children's experiences with school, but none of you are working together on solutions. Moving is hard, but uprooting your lives, costing your wife her job, to move back is also going to be hard on the kids, and if Marie *is* doing well at the new school, you \\*are\\* going to basically be throwing that away to go back.", "Yta your son is on drugs and you disrespected your wife's career? How would you ever not be the ah! \n\nYou should not be encouraging his behavior just because his life has changed, how is he going to cope as an adult? You should be addressing how to make things better.\n\nYour wife is entitled to living her life! Why are you belittling her? Why are you choosing sides with your son? You know this is an awkward age why are you blaming your wife???\n\nClearly you are not united in your parenting and choices and you need to fix that!!!", "Spot the golden child... Your post is dripping with misogyny.  Get over yourself. Get your son therapy, because teaching him he can run away every time a situation is difficult is doing him no favours at all. You also need to be honest, you never wanted your wife to excel, you never wanted her to step above her station and get promotion (I presume it either equals or excells your position,  and we can't have that now, can we?) Your wife now earns enough that you don't need to work full time, I suggest you stay at home and teach your son how much more important men are than women...oh wait...\n\nYta, misogyny has no place in this world.", "I was ready to blame you from the title, and I still think that specific comment was really badly phrased and has hurt not helped what you set out to achieve, but I think the core point you're making is relevant (that financially you can afford to move back).\n\nOverall I'm going to say YTA for phrasing it in a way that just hurt your wife and did nothing to help your son; on the wider point I think there's merit to your wider point about whether moving was the right call and needing to consider everyone's needs (you haven't mentioned your career so I assume you can work everywhere) but equally moving back now would be just as disruptive, including for a daughter that's settled in, and maybe isn't the best idea. It's possible to think you made a mistake to move and still not decide to move back.", "Did y\u2019all know before hand y\u2019all were moving to a more bigoted place?  If so I think it\u2019s a dick move to move to a place if you know beforehand it is less accepting of lgbtq individuals when you have a gay child.", "YTA. Your wife is right.", "YTA, and you sound like one of those parents that makes 3 different meals to appease everyone. There's no reason to diminish anyone's career like that. I've been in that position and would NEVER be so disrespectful to my SO.", "YTA my dad used to call my moms job a hobby. It\u2019s so disrespectful. You are putting her down.", "ESH \n\nI agree that your wife should be more sympathetic to your son, and that her punishment over him smoking weed likely isn\u2019t addressing the underlying problem and likely making things worse. Maybe you should both be putting more effort into his adjustment. What are YOU doing to help your son? If money isn\u2019t an object like you\u2019re saying, maybe even plan a trip for him to visit his friends back home or something. Not a permanent solution, but still might help give him something to look forward to. \nI do think your wife might be on to something about your treatment of your son vs daughter. Honestly sounds like you both might be playing favorites a bit, and I\u2019m sure your kids can tell. Try to take your own advice about your son and try to be more sympathetic to your daughter as well. \n\nYTA for calling your wife\u2019s career a passion project. Why couldn\u2019t she say the same thing about you? Having a career, especially as a woman, provides stability and the freedom to make choices in her relationship. Not to mention that being out of the workforce for any period of time can significantly hurt one\u2019s career and future earning potential. You\u2019re asking her to give up a lot more than a little \u201cpassion project.\u201d", "YTA - having a productive career that the wife finds fulfillment from is not a passion project just because OP is a trust fund baby.", "YTA got the comment and attitude toward your wife's work. \n\nThat said, did anyone want to weigh in on what happens to LGBTQ youth when they are cut off from an accepting support system? Let's check the stats, shall we? LGBTQ youth are 4 times more likely to attempt than other youth. 45% of LGBTQ youth report thinking about it.\n\nRemoval from a support system can have deadly consequences, especially with the implication that they are now living in a less accepting area. So much so that he doesn't want to come out to anyone at school. \n\nIt's a hard choice to make either way, but without an accepting support system, it's setting his son up for a lifetime of therapy at best, not surviving at worst. \n\nThank God the kid's father cares, because no one else seems to.", "YTA and your question is not the only reason you\u2019re TA.

If everyone but your wife was unhappy with the move, I could see considering moving back but your wife is happy and you admit that your daughter is doing much better in her new home. You also admit that your son has not made any effort at therapy. It\u2019s very common to not click with the first therapist you try.

If you'll also notice it said that the phone was only taken at home, meaning he has it at school, and while he may not be able to use it in class at the high school level in the US most schools allow them in passing periods and lunch so he isn't completely cut off. It sounds like he's having normal adjustment struggles to a move and starting hs. As someone who moved to a new city starting my freshman year of high school I can sympathize with that as it sucked, but that doesn't mean that the dad isn't still TA for being demeaning to his wife, disregarding his daughters improved life, and enabling his son to do drugs and other things. Instead they should support the son and help him to adjust and give it more time to see if it is just adjustment pains. It sounds like it is likely adjustment pains and the dad is blowing it out of proption because the son is his golden child given the tone of the post. Suicide rates may be higher in LGBT+ kids I won't negate that, but this sounds like there is just adjustment and the dad wants to coddle his golden child and disregard the rest of his family.", "dear god you went there", "In my personal opinion for exactly that reason moving back separately might be the best option. But \u201cdaughter thriving\u201d is not going to be a big consolation if the son ends up experiencing a version of what Mathew Shepard experienced or is getting so depressed that he ends up hurting himself. They should have never moved there to begin with; then now they would not have to be in the situation with two kids with conflicting needs.", "You keep calling the place you used to live \u201chome.\u201d You need to stop pretending that this isn\u2019t also about you having been very attached to the old place you lived as well. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not about your son in part, but that you need to admit to yourself that YOU\u2019RE not trying to transition to this new place either, and that impacts your kids because they can tell.\n\nYTA.", "Almost equally as well. So\u2026 not equally. She\u2019s doing better now. Why aren\u2019t you taking her needs into account?", "OP did leave another comment that said a therapist there was quoting bible verses and made him uncomfortable. And another comment that said he doesn\u2019t feel safe to come out. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty indicative of the severity of the situation. Not saying he can\u2019t still be happy there but parents really need to take initiative and make extra sure that he is connected to resources and social supports", "OP did leave another comment that said a therapist there was quoting bible verses and made him uncomfortable.

Kindly. \n\nSome kids launch immediately out of the nest and eat the world whole. \n\nSome kids cautiously step out and take bites, until they are comfortable. \n\nSome kids stay in the nest and are too afraid to find a worm. \n\nOPs kid is uncomfortable. Which is normal for a teen. But OP can find him launching pads and perspective ways to thrive. He\u2019s young enough to push him out of his comfort zone and see how it works. \n\nI absolutely found my people at a summer camp I. 7th grade. And it thought me how to speak for myself and get along and not be so afraid. \n\nIt just sounds like this kid needs a push. He will find wings or feet. But he needs the push.", "First, YTA. The way you speak about your wife, and to your wife, is completely unacceptable, even bordering on emotionally abusive.  Lots of people find having a career valuable and fulfilling.  On top of that, if something happens to you, or your marriage has issues, then she's screwed financially if she's been off the job market.  I can't even believe that you posted that and thought anyone would take your side for that remark!\n\nAlso, I'm seeing a lot of projection in the comments.  \"Less accepting\" of gay people doesn't mean it's actively hostile or dangerous.  And if you moved before school started, it's been six months.  Your kid is making friends, but of course they aren't going to be as close as the ones he left behind -- but they could be given a bit more time!  What are you doing to help him?  Are you looking for support resources for gay teens locally?  You are \"looking\" for another therapist -- well, get on that.  Instead of telling your wife she has to give up her career, and Marie that her happiness and well-being aren't as important as that of her brother, perhaps you can do more to help Alex adjust.  It honestly seems like you just threw up your hands and said \"Welp, that's it, it's been a few months and Alex isn't happy so that's that, gotta go back.\"  Teaching Alex that he's more important than his sister or mother isn't doing him any favors, either.\n\nI think you all need some family counseling, and that you need to take a good hard look at yourself and how you view your marriage and your wife. Because if you treated me like you treated your wife, and weren't willing to do some hard work and counseling to address your attitude, I'd be talking to a divorce lawyer.", "YTA if just because you took any legitimate concerns you could have raised, for example:\n\n1. You and your wife don't agree on how to discipline your kids and that's a problem, or;\n\n2. Your son is going through an extremely hard time in his life and needs extra support you don't think he's getting;\n\nAnd you instead belittled her work and implied she was a bad mother in one fell swoop, and came in with a solution already decided on rather than working with her to find one.\n\nGet your son a counsellor, get you and your wife a counsellor. Therapy for everyone. Apologize profusely to your wife and know it'll probably take a while for her to forgive you. Show her you respect her work, or else.", "I also feel like we need info on where OP moved to.\n\nThere are some really awful parts of the USA, where it would be hell to be a LGBT teen.", "Also the very nature of moving from one city to another isn't just some arbitrary decision you make one week and do the next, he makes it sound like Alex came out THEN they decided to move. \n\nI also doubt we're getting the full story on what happened with Alex and his wife's punishment, but something tells me from the wife's comment about him favouring Alex means he regularly gets the \"just don't do it again\" talk when he messes up.", "Yeah...\n\nIt's fine if you don't throw the book at them for weed, but *in the house*? Absolutely not. Smell, potential fire hazard...It's probably part \"cry for help\" but also *not okay.* Two weeks grounding is pretty fair.", "The kid is at a tough time general and doing what kids do though too\u2014yes maybe the area sucks more for LGBTQ but even in conservative states, there are many groups in that age range that support these days and it feels a little like OP has just figured the son missing his friends can\u2019t be fixed; this is evidenced by the \u201cbreaking\u201d point here was the kid smoking pot, not something that really suggests the area is hopeless and hateful and suggest anything as dramatic as moving and the Mom taking a demotion. There are other ways to support the kid besides moving back.", "they could live separately for a while without divorcing", "That doesn't apply in this situation. They uprooted their family to move for HER career, even though they don't need the money. Sounds like he values her career quite a bit....and she values her career over her children.", "The fact that it\u2019s in the house, alone means it\u2019s a regular thing, too. He\u2019s not just occasionally sharing a joint with friends.\n\nGetting caught by his parents and facing consequences is a safe version of what would happen if he got caught in the real world. If he\u2019s so casual about it at home, I\u2019d worry he\u2019s getting stoned at school, too.", "You do realize kids smoke weed to\u2026 smoke weed. Not saying he\u2019s not struggling but smoking is not necessary a \u201csymptom\u201d of that..", "You do realise weed kills brain cells in children.", "Not to mention it sounds like because it's not a PERFECT fit, Alex is just choosing not engage with groups or therapy any further than the initial try. I wonder how often plans had to be changed or manipulated so that Alex could \"feel better\" and how often that meant wife and daughter went without?", "A recent C.D.C. report said three of every five girls reported significant prolonged sadness in 2021 and one in three considered suicide.  Shouldn\u2019t we be just as concerned that moving the daughter will have a significant impact on her well-being?", "Love everything you pointed out here and oh as OP says in his comments. Marie was fiiiiinnneeee back home so she should be okay... he thinks.  \n\nDoesn't give a single flying shit about the daughter at all. I wonder if she acts out once back home because she's moved around like a chess piece the dad will just stick her into therapy and tell her to stop being selfish. \n\nOP YTA", "Yeah that's why I'm falling on ESH for this one. Honestly they should just split and each take their favorite kid with them, would probably be the least worst resolution to all of this.", "Funny how the son's unhappiness and the likelihood that he's constantly subjected to homophobic micro aggression with little support is unimportant. You're right we need more equality but that includes for queer people, something cishet women love to ignore.", "Never seen it myself, personally, but that's what I's told when I first got here so that's what I tell people that ask.", "He has friends and everything, in OP's words he's \"not gotten really comfortable\". That's not micro aggressions, that's not homophobia, that's not unhappiness. That's getting used to new circumstances plus being a teenager.\n\nIf he was being bullied, I doubt they would have stayed there for A YEAR.\n\nStop making up hate where there isn't any, that's part of the problem.", "Bullying in teen years isn't that simple. There's every chance that he's enduring worse than he tells his parents. I certainly struggled to communicate the extent of bullying I endured,  or even the challenges I was facing. I just seemed generally unhappy all the time.", "Friends from his old school read the post before commenting.", "Or what if they move back and the younger son struggles to find his footing again with his old friends? People change a lot in their early teens-- it's possible that he would be dealing with some emotional issues / experimentation with drugs right now either way.  Mom sounds callous (wtf, it's ok that son is unhappy because he'll go to college in three years?? These are formative years) but it also sounds like dad is resentful that mom's career is important enough to be prioritized and is making it all about the son. \n\nESH. They should work to support son where he is for now.", "But we've got to work with what we're given here.\n\nI was bullied in high school, too, only got away by changing schools, but OP states \"Alex made a few friends\", so he can't be a complete outsider.\n\nEven my (very oblivious) parents wouldn't have thought I was making friends while I was being bullied, so this just doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nIf he was being bullied or actually really unhappy, I'm sure his mother would address that, since she actually seems to care about both her children, quite unlike his father.", "Right back at you \"Alex has made a few friends\" doesn't sound like he made them at his old school, right?"]}
