Alex has had a rough time since. He had come out to us and his school mates as gay just a little while before he got the news that we were moving, so it was particularly hard for him. He had found a solid support system and felt safe where we lived before. That was taken away with this move.\n\nThe place we live now, while still in the US, is less accepting. Alex has made a few friends but despite us being here for a year, he still hasn't really gotten comfortable here. Marie, on the other hand, really loves it and has been excelling at this new school thanks to clicking better with her teachers this year.\n\nThe move did cause some tension between my wife and I even before we made a decision. I know there's no easy time to move, but doing so during the transition between middle school and high school (arguably the most awkward time of a person's life) felt like a cruel punishment for our son to endure. My wife said it would make things easier since he would be starting a new school either way.\n\nI feel like my wife has been very unsympathetic to what our son is going through. A few weeks ago, we found weed in his room. While I was full prepared to 1. make sure he wasn't self-medicating in a way that could lead somewhere dangerous and 2. give him the 'don't be stupid, don't drive under the influence and don't stink up your room anymore' talk, his mom grounded him for two weeks and took away his phone every afternoon after school. This cut him off from his friends from his old school, further isolating him during an already hard time.\n\nThis brings us to last week. I finally sat my wife down and told her things weren't working. We gave it a try for a year, but Alex has consistently expressed his unhappiness and discomfort to us. I told her it was time to start making plans to go back. She said that Marie was doing great here and that I always favored Alex as 'the baby of the family,' and that we needed to give things more time. She also said both kids would be off to college soon.\n\nI replied that I wasn't willing to let my son live in discomfort for three more years before college. Also, my job and money I had gotten from my grandparents (a trust fund of sorts) more than covers our living expenses and there's no real NEED for her to work. I said it was incredibly selfish to put a passion project ahead of her own child, and that being a parent meant sometimes putting our \"needs\" on the backburner while we do what's best for them.\n\nShe was furious that I called her career a passion project and hasn't spoken to me since. I'm at a loss how to move forward.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT for clarification: I don\u2019t expect her to stop working or to be financially dependent on me. She could still work back in our home state (I would want her to, I\u2019m glad it makes her happy!) but she doesn\u2019t want to go back since it was essentially be a \u201cdemotion\u201d and a drop in her salary - which is extra money that we don\u2019t need anyway.", "created_utc": 1676751080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115oyj6/aita_for_calling_my_wifes_career_choice_a_passion/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you think moving back will be a magic bullet for your son? Teendom isn\u2019t easy for anyone. You don\u2019t know if his support system would\u2019ve held in the transition to high school.\n\nI suspect that you were happier before the move. You seem to resent your wife\u2019s job, and you likely resent the time her job takes away from you. You probably also like the power that comes from controlling all of the money. Moving back is what you want for you, and the bonus is that Alex seemed happier there, too. \n\nYou two need counseling both for your marriage and on how help Alex through adolescence.", "I really feel like this is something you all should discuss with a therapist instead of a bunch of randos on Reddit \n\nEither way though, you need to consider everyone feelings and emotions, not just Alex\u2019s. Calling your wife\u2019s career choice as a \u201cpassion project\u201d is kinda insensitive. Like does she make an income off it?

Many people for good reason are uncomfortable being financially dependent on a spouse. Many people derive a meaning beyond just money from their job.

It creates problems for one child & solves problems for the other.  \n\nAs to what your family should do, that\u2019s hard to say.

That's a dick move.\n\nHave you tried counseling for your son?

First, you capitalized the word \"NEED\".  Maybe your wife does \\*NEED\\* to work for her to live a life worth living.  Next, you are the AH because you think you can solve all of your child's problems.  Struggle builds character.  It sounds like you are able to provide the basics for your kids, which is great.  That means they can take risks, try new things, experience life in different ways than a lot of kids get to.  Now help them be adults by allowing them to struggle if they are in a moment in time where they are struggling.  Completely upending your life (again) to fix a problem that time will probably solve is not a good solution.  Also, your other kid, as you said, is doing great in the new location.  Be good to her too.", "YTA. It was demeaning of you to dismiss her working as a \"passion project.\"\n\nIt also sounds like you're prioritizing the feelings of your son over your daughter, who you say is doing well in your new home.\n\nA friend of mine lost his high school-aged son to drugs a few years ago, so I don't think your wife's punishment of your son was too harsh.\n\nYou now seem split; wife and daughter want to stay, husband and son want to leave. I don't know how this can be resolved because either decision to going to lead to resentment. Counseling/therapy is the only thing I can suggest.", "Ok, that comment was 100% YTA\n\nbut your worrying about your son is completely understandable. You said that the move created tension between you and your wife even before it happened.\nIs there a reason why you accepted it in the first place? Is there any family around? Is your wife okay with your son being gay? You said your wife has been unsympathetic of what your son is going through: did she do anything else that made you feel this way?", "Yeah, YTA.  You clearly don't think of your spouse as an equal partner, and as long as that remains the case, YTA.", "Your math is terrible.

Your teenager isn't broken. They experimented with drugs. They are adjusting to a new place. It's not a crisis it's normal. Let them adjust. \n\nYou're a huge AH.", "Yeah dude, YTA. Who are you to say it's a \"passion project\" and treat her job like it means nothing? It's also an AH move to uproot your family when your wife and daughter are happy. Have you tried actually getting involved in your son's life? Also, odds are that moving back won't fix anything because now he'll have to RE-transition back into the old neighborhood.", "YTA.\n\n>She was furious that I called her career a passion project and hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nLook, there are few things that are more harmful to an adult's health than someone who wants to work not working. Homemakers and gainfully employed people alike don't fall into depression and substance abuse as quickly and easily as unemployed people because they are doing something of service that helps them feel useful. So my question is, why is her \"passion\" to be useful to the wider world more important than your \"passion\" to be useful to your family?\n\nYour statement to your wife, aside from being deeply personally insulting, is emasculating and threatening death to her well-being. Your reasons are irrelevant. Find another way.\n\nWith respect to your son's parenting, I am more disturbed by your (both of you) inability to be happy with each other's styles than by either one of yours individually. Children need both nurturing and limits so they can solve problems on their own. Your son should not have smoked marijuana in the first place and he must learn more control over his own decisions, or he will not get what he wants (phone time). What your wife is trying to teach your son is how to master his own choices, in the environment he is currently in. On its own that will not work, but neither will you trying to give him support (or more accurately, a brand new environment) in response to his poor choices.", "You both are TA. You're parents of a gay kid, and you didn't bother to do any research about the location beforehand??? Just because straight people can move wherever they want and be fine doesn't mean your son will be. \n\nThere are plenty of maps online that tell you what the state of LGBTQ rights are. You could have called or emailed the Trevor Project and asked them for a list of the best cities for LGBTQ youth. And then compared that to places your wife would have been able to work in her field.\n\nBoth of you failed to protect your son and take his basic safety needs into account. When LGBTQ kids are in an unsafe environment, they are more likely to do worse in school and make unsafe life choices. It's documented over and over. By LGBTQ groups and the CDC. \n\nGet your shit together. Stop blaming your son for trying to cope with hostile environments, and realize you two are most of the problem. Learn about local resources. Take him to and from youth group or PFLAG meetings if there's nothing else.", "YTA- have you actually looked for resources to help your son in your area?", "On the \u201cpassion project\u201d front, YTA. Very invalidating to call a woman\u2019s career that and imply that she could just stay home for the sake of children. Just because it\u2019s financially possible, doesn\u2019t mean that is what has to be done. \n\nHOWEVER, that being said. There is a problem at hand. That I don\u2019t think either of you are the assholes for. One of your children is going through something, and it should be discussed between the two of you. Moving can be really difficult for kids, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean to immediately move back, especially if the oldest is close to graduating. I think more needs to be done than just letting it be and \u201cgiving it time\u201d after a year of discomfort for Alex, but before doing the extreme of moving again, more solutions and options should be sought after. Therapy? Extra curricular activities? Maybe open up communication with Alex to see what he thinks could help. \n\nBest of luck with your kid.", "Your concern for Alex's wellbeing is admirable and you've picked up he's struggling which perhaps your wife has overlooked or not given enough credence to.  Also, you're not necessarily wrong about parental sacrifice although that comes down to \"where reasonable.\"\n\nThat being said, as soon as you referred to your wife's career as a passion project, that's basically devalued her own aspirations.  Going to take a lot of back-pedalling on that one and I hope it's not your genuine view.\n\nESH.  I think you definitely need to find a way to remove your foot from your mouth but perhaps your wife would do well to give more credence to Alex's struggles.", "YTA because you clearly look at people and approach your relationships with them as a cost benefit analysis.  You are completely disregarding that your daughter and wife experiencing success and fulfillment in their school in work should be completely negated because your son is in an understandably hard and awkward time in his life.  \n\nYou need to find a way to put your effort into supporting your son not dragging the rest of the family down to his level.", "Well well well, aren't you just patronising as all fuck?\n\nYTA and your backstory is completely irrelevant. For what's it's worth on that this issue will follow your kid. His ability to fit in and make friends isn't because of where he is. He's a 15 year old boy who happens to be gay. Being angsty about his place in the world and being socially awkward is par for the course. You are babying him.", "YTA- for phrasing it that way.  As someone who moved around a lot as a kid (dad was military) might I make a suggestion.  You and your son move back home, using your money.  Your wife and daughter stay there, using her money.  This way each child gets exactly what they need.", "ESH - The desire to be productive and work isn't a \"passion project\" and it's very dismissive and hurtful to call it that. You should be supportive of your partner's career and ambitions. Your wife isn't wrong that the bridge between middle and high school is actually one of the better times to move, precisely because so many people change schools and end up meeting so many new people when they enter high school. Your wife and you should be brainstorming ways to help your son find himself and find ways to be happier, but also, \"I'm unhappy and uncomfortable\" is pretty normal at that age, and you need to figure out how to be on the same page, parenting-wise, because you're showing pretty huge signs that you're not working together and you're not on the same page. You're being dismissive of her career and she's being dismissive of the children's experiences with school, but none of you are working together on solutions. Moving is hard, but uprooting your lives, costing your wife her job, to move back is also going to be hard on the kids, and if Marie *is* doing well at the new school, you \\*are\\* going to basically be throwing that away to go back.", "Yta your son is on drugs and you disrespected your wife's career? How would you ever not be the ah! \n\nYou should not be encouraging his behavior just because his life has changed, how is he going to cope as an adult? You should be addressing how to make things better.\n\nYour wife is entitled to living her life! Why are you belittling her? Why are you choosing sides with your son? You know this is an awkward age why are you blaming your wife???\n\nClearly you are not united in your parenting and choices and you need to fix that!!!", "Spot the golden child... Your post is dripping with misogyny.  Get over yourself. Get your son therapy, because teaching him he can run away every time a situation is difficult is doing him no favours at all. You also need to be honest, you never wanted your wife to excel, you never wanted her to step above her station and get promotion (I presume it either equals or excells your position,  and we can't have that now, can we?) Your wife now earns enough that you don't need to work full time, I suggest you stay at home and teach your son how much more important men are than women...oh wait...\n\nYta, misogyny has no place in this world.", "I was ready to blame you from the title, and I still think that specific comment was really badly phrased and has hurt not helped what you set out to achieve, but I think the core point you're making is relevant (that financially you can afford to move back).\n\nOverall I'm going to say YTA for phrasing it in a way that just hurt your wife and did nothing to help your son; on the wider point I think there's merit to your wider point about whether moving was the right call and needing to consider everyone's needs (you haven't mentioned your career so I assume you can work everywhere) but equally moving back now would be just as disruptive, including for a daughter that's settled in, and maybe isn't the best idea. It's possible to think you made a mistake to move and still not decide to move back.", "Did y\u2019all know before hand y\u2019all were moving to a more bigoted place?  If so I think it\u2019s a dick move to move to a place if you know beforehand it is less accepting of lgbtq individuals when you have a gay child.", "YTA. Your wife is right.", "YTA, and you sound like one of those parents that makes 3 different meals to appease everyone. There's no reason to diminish anyone's career like that. I've been in that position and would NEVER be so disrespectful to my SO.", "YTA my dad used to call my moms job a hobby. It\u2019s so disrespectful. You are putting her down.", "ESH \n\nI agree that your wife should be more sympathetic to your son, and that her punishment over him smoking weed likely isn\u2019t addressing the underlying problem and likely making things worse. Maybe you should both be putting more effort into his adjustment. What are YOU doing to help your son? If money isn\u2019t an object like you\u2019re saying, maybe even plan a trip for him to visit his friends back home or something. Not a permanent solution, but still might help give him something to look forward to. \nI do think your wife might be on to something about your treatment of your son vs daughter. Honestly sounds like you both might be playing favorites a bit, and I\u2019m sure your kids can tell. Try to take your own advice about your son and try to be more sympathetic to your daughter as well. \n\nYTA for calling your wife\u2019s career a passion project. Why couldn\u2019t she say the same thing about you? Having a career, especially as a woman, provides stability and the freedom to make choices in her relationship. Not to mention that being out of the workforce for any period of time can significantly hurt one\u2019s career and future earning potential. You\u2019re asking her to give up a lot more than a little \u201cpassion project.\u201d", "YTA - having a productive career that the wife finds fulfillment from is not a passion project just because OP is a trust fund baby.", "YTA got the comment and attitude toward your wife's work. \n\nThat said, did anyone want to weigh in on what happens to LGBTQ youth when they are cut off from an accepting support system? Let's check the stats, shall we? LGBTQ youth are 4 times more likely to attempt than other youth. 45% of LGBTQ youth report thinking about it.\n\nRemoval from a support system can have deadly consequences, especially with the implication that they are now living in a less accepting area. So much so that he doesn't want to come out to anyone at school. \n\nIt's a hard choice to make either way, but without an accepting support system, it's setting his son up for a lifetime of therapy at best, not surviving at worst. \n\nThank God the kid's father cares, because no one else seems to.", "YTA and your question is not the only reason you\u2019re TA.

If everyone but your wife was unhappy with the move, I could see considering moving back but your wife is happy and you admit that your daughter is doing much better in her new home. You also admit that your son has not made any effort at therapy. It\u2019s very common to not click with the first therapist you try.

Alex has had a rough time since. He had come out to us and his school mates as gay just a little while before he got the news that we were moving, so it was particularly hard for him. He had found a solid support system and felt safe where we lived before. That was taken away with this move.\n\nThe place we live now, while still in the US, is less accepting. Alex has made a few friends but despite us being here for a year, he still hasn't really gotten comfortable here. Marie, on the other hand, really loves it and has been excelling at this new school thanks to clicking better with her teachers this year.\n\nThe move did cause some tension between my wife and I even before we made a decision.

While I was full prepared to 1. make sure he wasn't self-medicating in a way that could lead somewhere dangerous and 2. give him the 'don't be stupid, don't drive under the influence and don't stink up your room anymore' talk, his mom grounded him for two weeks and took away his phone every afternoon after school. This cut him off from his friends from his old school, further isolating him during an already hard time.\n\nThis brings us to last week. I finally sat my wife down and told her things weren't working. We gave it a try for a year, but Alex has consistently expressed his unhappiness and discomfort to us.

You should figure out how to live where you are & quit thinking that moving anywhere is a magic bullet.", "I understand. \n\nBut from my own experience, forcing a parent who \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it\u201d and \u201cthinks it\u2019s unnecessary \u201c or \u201cthinks it\u2019s a waste of time\u201d causes more trauma for the child. \n\nHaving a parent participate who thinks it\u2019s a waste or stupid is more detrimental. They encourage you to quit. They downplay  achievements. They make you feel like a burden for things you need. \n\nIf wife isn\u2019t willing to work or understand with Alex, that\u2019s unfortunate. But a lot of families deal with that. For a lot more reasons than sexuality. It was a similar narrative when I was a kid, about wildly different things. \n\nBut instead of focusing on the wife not investing or being compassionate, and spending his time on a fight where nobody wins, OP can focus on Alex. \n\nIt sucks that mom isn\u2019t on board. \n\nBut my dad was never with me either. \n\nI don\u2019t hate him. He just never understood me, and it took until he was 60 before he finally looked back and realized he should have listened to what I had to say. \n\nHe always wondered why me and mom were best friends, and he was a left out. \n\nNow he knows. It was her acceptance of me for who I was. And she helped me pursue every opportunity. While he sat outside and didn\u2019t get it. \n\nOP can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d his wife. \n\nBut he can be a fantastic father for Alex, and be an example for everyone to do the same. \n\nAlex will appreciate this later.", "I wish he had elaborated on the struggles a bit more. A teenager smoking weed doesn\u2019t always mean they are struggling.", "Find him another therapist. Sometimes you need to shop around for a therapist just like if you went to a doctor that you didn't like or has a bad bedside manner.  Therapists are  NOT a  \"one size therapist fits all patients\" deal. Find some local LGBTQ+ support groups, get involved with them YOURSELF as a parent, and see if they can give recommendations for a good therapist. I will bet the locals have some crazy stories, especially in a \"less-than-inclusive\" area.", "Zoom/video therapy may be an option. The main thing is to find a therapist who uses secular approaches and has experience with queer adolescents.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, especially in the midwest, I know someone good.", "Would he be open to online therapy?  He could have more variety of therapists and may even find one from the LGBTG+ community.  I'd also recommend giving him the autonomy of choosing his own therapist.", "Would a video therapy appointment work for him, to start? \n\nI am NOT advocating betterhelp or that kind of service. Those CAN be helpful, if all you need is talk therapy. They can\u2019t do more than that. \n\nI\u2019m saying your insurance provider may give options for therapists online with the same price that can do video. \n\nAnd in that case, you can specify it must be secular and LGBTQ friendly. Advocate for that right off the bat, and they will source you someone if therapy is on your coverage plan. \n\nIf your insurance won\u2019t recommend someone willing to give your son appropriate treatment? Contact your states mental health licensing website. They should have a phone line for pointing you to someone. Even in a conservative state. (I found someone for my niece in Harrison AR, birthplace of the KKK). \n\nOutside of therapy - it would be good to check out the LGBTQ subs here and ask for advice as a parent. Don\u2019t mention your wife or daughter or place blame. Just ask for resources for your kiddo that needs a tribe. And I guarantee they will find you something. \n\nMy resources would all be in Oregon, which I doubt fits your needs. But Reddit has some AMAZING groups that could give you great resources. \n\nI get what you and kiddo are dealing with. \n\nBut take all of the shit you\u2019re projecting on your wife, and put that energy into helping him thrive. \n\nOnce you do that, you will find groups and pages and summer camps and clubs out the wazoo. \n\nMost peoples barriers are that they can\u2019t afford these things. But you sound like you can. So get him that support. Have him look, if he\u2019s comfortable. Be open minded. He\u2019s at an age where saying no is easier than saying yes, especially if you\u2019re already struggling. \n\nSo be there to encourage.", "A lot of therapists do telehealth now too\nI and my mom are both therapists who almost exclusively do that", "Online therapists exist", "no because he went ahead and got Alex religious therapy complete with rampant Bible quotes", "Not yet. His first therapist was a terrible fit and we\u2019re working on getting another.", "I misread the original comment, so I deleted my response. I thought it was asking what I would\u2019ve done if the initial move had affected Marie instead of Alex.", "Thank you for the advice. I\u2019ll ask around.", "He\u2019s not particularly fond of the idea. He said the thought of it doesn\u2019t feel like how he would imagine therapy is supposed to feel if it\u2019s not properly face to face. I offered to let him have the house to himself for that time if he was worried about someone overhearing him, but he still said he didn\u2019t think it would be what he was looking for.", "Thank you for the advice. Online therapy isn\u2019t something he\u2019s currently interested in, but it would be a start and something to tide him over until we found something more permanent. \n\nI\u2019ll look into your other suggestions here, too. It\u2019s terrible, feeling not just powerless as a parent who can\u2019t control others around your kid, but to feel responsible for a choice that\u2019s making them miserable.", "So instead of actually supporting your child, you know doing the work, your just going to run away.", "\u2026 so the kid isn\u2019t in therapy, you\u2019re throwing a fit as if his mom is some horrible dictator because she grounded a 13-14 year old for having drugs, you\u2019re downplaying her job, and you\u2019re willing to torpedo your relationship with both your wife and daughter, because Alex is struggling a bit. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but struggling a bit is part of fucking life. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s being bullied or anything is actually happening TO him. It just sounds like he\u2019s \u201cnot comfortable\u201d and would rather be back at the old town. News flash. Moving is hard. Moving is especially hard if you do not try to get over it at all. It doesn\u2019t sound like Alex has, and is instead hoping if he complains enough you\u2019ll give in. *And you\u2019re actually considering doing just that! Crazy!*\n\nYour wife is right. It sounds like you baby the shit out of Alex. Grounding a CHILD, a YOUNG CHILD (he\u2019s barely a teen!) for doing drugs is *reasonable!* It sucks that Alex is going through something, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s above consequence. And it\u2019s just crazy to blow up your marriage and relationship with your own daughter to baby an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d teen.", "That's fine, although the effectiveness of online is the same as face-to-face, some clients don't get on well with online therapy.  It might be worth looking to see if anyone in your area offers walk and talk therapy.", "Having completed 12 weeks of online therapy and not getting it the first few weeks you don't know unless you try! Find a peer group for him too. Hiding who he is is what's making his decline. You've got to tell him he needs to try other therapists. Be the parent here! You want to sacrifice his happiness for your daughters. Again be a parent and get him another therapist and seek out peer support for him! BTW YTA", "I understand, and kudos for you for working at it. \n\nThese things take time and man hours, and a lot of random good moments with you for kiddo to realize you are on his side. The more good moments he has naturally, the more open he\u2019ll see things. The more he\u2019ll listen and accept peer support, instead of thinking it\u2019s cheesy. \n\nJune is Pride month. (Or In some places, October?)\n\nCould you take him for a weekend/week getaway, just you two? Without being heavy handed upfront that the trip is ABOUT his sexuality?\n\nMake it just about a fun \u201cguys trip\u201d?\n\nTo a place like Disney\u2019s pride week, or somewhere where a big street fair with a week long event list goes on like Portland or SF or NYC? Or even a smaller city that you find has a good all-welcoming event?\n\nDon\u2019t deck out in rainbows. Just go and enjoy the food and music and walk around. See what he\u2019s comfortable with. Feel it out. Let him choose what you do. But insist on doing something every day. Even if it\u2019s just having breakfast at a restaurant downtown. \n\nI\u2019m a social worker for abused kids. Cisgender, straight, married white woman. \n\nLast year, I volunteered for an organization that had the kids raise funds, and a group of us got a bundle of hotel rooms and took our LGBTQ foster kids to pride for a couple days. \n\nSome of them were from rural areas where they had never met another gay kid. One of them was from a very strict Muslim family that had beat her for being a lesbian. Some kids were there to make connections and form youth chapters for LGBTQ groups in their area. \n\nSome kids were just there to observe and see what it\u2019s about. \n\nAll of the kids ended up having a good time, although how they participated and to what extent varied. \n\nI\u2019m asking that you consider it. \n\nThose events aren\u2019t for everyone. But feeling comfortable around a parent can go along way. \n\nIf you can naturally get him to agree, something like that could be a bonding moment and a weight off the chest for both of you."]}
