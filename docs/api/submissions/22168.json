You get breaks with traveling for your work but she never does.  Sounds like a reasonable request to me.  You may need to negotiate the time involved perhaps, but do not gloss over this request because I suspect it is very important to her.  If she's been a great mom and wife, do your best to make this happen.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't have to understand her reasons. But if it helps, try this: imagine that your job required you to be working or on call to work 24 hours a day for years on end, with the person you were supposed to be a team with would regularly be gone for a week at a time. If you wanted to use 3 weeks of vacation time after that, would that be unreasonable?\n\nThat said, it really doesn't matter if you understand. She's gone through a physically traumatic experience four times, an emotionally traumatic experience once, and she's frequently picking up the slack for an absent spouse. *For years*. She deserves this. You should make it happen -- and once you have shepherded the kids through those 3 weeks, you can continue to be an engaged enough parent that she is able to spend time away from the family when she wants/needs to.", "I think there\u2019s a compromise to be made here. Maybe instead of taking a month long vacation- suggest that she just take three separate week long vacations this year. It would be the same amount of time, just spread out. If anything, it would be more relieving for her knowing every four months she gets to go on a new vacation. I think her desire for a break is warranted, well deserved, and totally normal- but at a practical level, it\u2019s not totally feasible. You have a job, she has a job, the kids have things going on. That\u2019s a lot to put on the back burner for a month, but easy to do in week long increments.", "INFO: WTF is a golden birthday?!", "Jesus, I read all the comments and you just suck so much.

Mid life crisis? How insensitive.. you travel for work.. she takes care of family.. you should be able to parent your kid while she takes time off.. good chance if you play nice she might decide to come home early too...", "30 days is pretty reasonable for a vacation after that many years of being a primary caretaker (You admit to being gone for work for a week at a time). And 10 of them will still be with the family she loves. I can understand being worried about stepping up for that long if you're not used to it, or having to schedule time away from work trips, but it's not crazy or bad to want that vacation time. Frankly, as an introvert, I constantly feel like I could use two weeks to myself after a lot of social pressures like kids and relationships. I don't always take that time, obviously, (actually only once in the last 15 years) but once in a decade is pretty reasonable in my opinion. Especially knowing that she's grieving over a lost child.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t need your permission", "OP why even post? The thread is overwhelmingly YTA and yet not one of your comments has shown any acknowledgement that maybe you're wrong or have some reevaluating to do. Your wife is overworked and needs some time away. Yes she'll still be working her job for those 20 days BUT  she won't be in mum mode. You seem weirdly unable to understand that. You've also mentioned that you would spend every moment with your kids if you could. But you haven't. You've spent 5 months a year away from them.

She has more than earned a month vacation for herself.", "The fact that she\u2019s asking for and idealizing this much time with that many kids at home speaks to the decade of hard work with no time off and no mental escape from her family. YTA. Give her the month and gladly. Even if you think it\u2019s a lot. The fact that you\u2019re this worried or upset means you know how much she\u2019s shouldered and what you\u2019ll have to pick up when she\u2019s gone. Now multiply that over ten years and complain.", "YTA, by reading the comments you\u2019ve made ,you just don\u2019t want her to go bc your sexist and don\u2019t think she should be away from children for 20days. She is more then a mother , she\u2019s a person. You are unsupportive, controlling, and demeaning in this post towards your wife", "YTA. You're not the boss of her and your wife is still very young. She's probably on social media seeing friends having all kinds of adventures and wondering what might've been. Which doesn't mean she regrets her life with you and your kids, but it's got to be depressing to think that she might have to wait 10+ years to do anything like this.", "INFO: Is this an admission of your incompetence and incapability to parent your kids?", "YTA - it\u2019s 20 days away from you. Get over it. Raising kids is hard work - she deserves to get away and have fun in the way that she wants.", "YTA. This sounds like a really cool experience, and you should be happy for her. Being away from the kids a few weeks in a decade span is not indicative of some sort of deficiency as a parent. If that were the case, you\u2019re already way ahead of her! She\u2019s also role-modeling independence and healthy risk-taking for the kids. Like good god, I WISH my mom would have traveled on occasion when I was a kid. She\u2019d probably have been less depressed, which is good for everyone, and I wouldn\u2019t have had to be the one in the family trying to set the example for my younger sibling that taking a vacation doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna get mugged, eaten by a shark, or die in a fiery plane crash. It\u2019s not 1930, build her up and share her excitement, rather than trying to turn this trip into another drag she\u2019s got to manage a ton of stress around. After raising the kids, y\u2019all owe it to her to survive on your own for that short period of time.", "YTA! If you are able to afford this, let her do it. Is it possible that she has dreams and desires that don't involve you or her children? I would certainly hope so! As stated by others, she has spent her adult life catering to and caring for you and your children. Why on earth would she not want to spend time on her own? I guarantee she rarely gets to use the bathroom without someone knocking. I guarantee she hasn't gotten a Saturday morning that doesn't involve cleaning, meals and running errands. Not to mention hearing someone say \"I'm starving, there's nothing to eat\", on a regular basis. \n\nLet this lovely woman, who has done so much for everyone else for so long, have a break. To drink a cup of coffee undisturbed, to take a shower without company, to relax in a chair in the sun without worrying about what the kids are getting into. \n\nIf we could have afforded it, I would have done the same thing. Quit being so insecure and let her be her own person.", "It\u2019s twenty days out of the whole year versus your 4-5 months. She\u2019s right she has given up her youth to be a parent, a wife and a worker. What\u2019s so wrong about her wanting to breathe alone for twenty days !!! Being away from you and the kids dosen\u2019t make her love anyone less it just means she\u2019s a human and humans need time to breath and relax and recenter. \n\nSAH parents experience intense burnout and a sense of loss of identity, this could be the thing that keeps her off the edge. Ofcs YTA she\u2019s made all the arrangements and she\u2019s coming back, she\u2019s not going to cut contact she\u2019ll likely call and text everyday and it could strengthen your family bond and allow you to see things from her perspective too.", "I\u2019m not saying yta but traveling solo is so freeing.", "YTA. If I needed this time, I would take it regardless of your utterly selfish opinion. She is an autonomous human who is telling you what she needs.", "I mean in general premise, no it\u2019s not the greatest for a mom with multiple young kids to disappear for a month straight.

She\u2019s given the last 10 years of her life to you and your children. And all you can do is whine and make her feel guilty? She\u2019s literally asking for the first 10 days to be with YOU and the kids. It\u2019s not even on a whim either. It\u2019s well thought out and budgeted too. And bottom line, it very much means something to HER. You\u2019re so focused on the fact that if YOU don\u2019t understand why, she\u2019s not even allowed to do it.

I would, in turn, be more than happy for him to get away too.", "ESH\n\nAs a mom of three, a whole month is a bit much. However, it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to want to get away with her family, then some time with her sister and some time alone. \n\nBeing the default parent gets taxing very quickly.", "YTA. This reeks of control. If you need help it sounds like you have a community to help support with child care. If its possible for her to do this, then she should.

Being a stay at home mom since I was 20 myself I can make some assumptions as to why this is important to her.  It's hard to see who you really are when you are always around children.
