{"id": 22168, "submission_id": "14z3msl", "title": "AITA for not approving of my wife\u2019s vacation request?", "selftext": "Throwaway account/ For some context my wife and I have been married 7 years. We have 4 kids together, our first when she was 19 (I\u2019m two years older). Unfortunately he passed and we now have 3 children 9, 7, 5. So she was either pregnant or raising a baby a majority of her 20s.\n\nWell she\u2019s turning 30 this year, and it\u2019s also her golden birthday. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s having a midlife crisis or something but she wants to travel for that entire month.\n\nShe proposed, the kids and I for the first 10 days. 10 days with her sister and then 10 days solo.\n\nI think it\u2019s crazy she would want to leave me and the kids that long but she arguing that she\u2019s spent all of her youth taking care of us and just wants one month to experience the things she\u2019s missed.\n\nI\u2019ll add that I travel for work but a week at a time before spending days back home.\n\nShe\u2019s a great mother and partner but I just don\u2019t see how and why she\u2019d want to be away that long. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable. Her sister/family is on me about how she deserves this and that she\u2019s more then then \u201csomeone\u2019s mother\u201d.\n\nI really need second opinions because I can\u2019t see how anyone would find this acceptable. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: I do not mind watching my kids, when I\u2019m not traveling I work from home and am with them daily. I have a good support system and would not need her here, however it\u2019s not acceptable for a mother to spend 20 days away from her children, husband and from her job. She can find herself in a spa or something.\n\nEDIT2: Do you all not realize that I also lost my 20s, that I\u2019ve also been raising kids and working. Traveling for work is not fun, and not a vacation. I\u2019d never even think to ask her for a month vacation. Be real.\n\nEDIT3: LAST EDIT: I think you all are getting me wrong, and I suck at explaining myself. And my wording has sucks. I understand my wife has sacrificed a lot, as have I. When we lost our child, she stopped working for a year while I worked. I don\u2019t mind her going on vacation, we go on vacations. I do not think a MONTH is acceptable. We have always had help. Her mother nannied all of the kids until they were in school. She can go solo, with family, with a random friend I\u2019ve never met for all I care but she cannot leave for a month. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable for me to believe.", "created_utc": 1689301063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z3msl/aita_for_not_approving_of_my_wifes_vacation/", "score": 868, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's not only been very busy parenting for over a decade, she's lost a child (don't know how fresh that is) and been busy supporting you in your career efforts by taking care of the homefront.  You get breaks with traveling for your work but she never does.  Sounds like a reasonable request to me.  You may need to negotiate the time involved perhaps, but do not gloss over this request because I suspect it is very important to her.  If she's been a great mom and wife, do your best to make this happen.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't have to understand her reasons. But if it helps, try this: imagine that your job required you to be working or on call to work 24 hours a day for years on end, with the person you were supposed to be a team with would regularly be gone for a week at a time. If you wanted to use 3 weeks of vacation time after that, would that be unreasonable?\n\nThat said, it really doesn't matter if you understand. She's gone through a physically traumatic experience four times, an emotionally traumatic experience once, and she's frequently picking up the slack for an absent spouse. *For years*. She deserves this. You should make it happen -- and once you have shepherded the kids through those 3 weeks, you can continue to be an engaged enough parent that she is able to spend time away from the family when she wants/needs to.", "I think there\u2019s a compromise to be made here. Maybe instead of taking a month long vacation- suggest that she just take three separate week long vacations this year. It would be the same amount of time, just spread out. If anything, it would be more relieving for her knowing every four months she gets to go on a new vacation. I think her desire for a break is warranted, well deserved, and totally normal- but at a practical level, it\u2019s not totally feasible. You have a job, she has a job, the kids have things going on. That\u2019s a lot to put on the back burner for a month, but easy to do in week long increments.", "INFO: WTF is a golden birthday?!", "Jesus, I read all the comments and you just suck so much. You\u2019re wife will be so much better off after she leaves you, especially considering she already has a support system to help with the kids, since you obviously don\u2019t parent at all", "YTA she's young still! Mid life crisis? How insensitive.. you travel for work.. she takes care of family.. you should be able to parent your kid while she takes time off.. good chance if you play nice she might decide to come home early too...", "30 days is pretty reasonable for a vacation after that many years of being a primary caretaker (You admit to being gone for work for a week at a time). And 10 of them will still be with the family she loves. I can understand being worried about stepping up for that long if you're not used to it, or having to schedule time away from work trips, but it's not crazy or bad to want that vacation time. Frankly, as an introvert, I constantly feel like I could use two weeks to myself after a lot of social pressures like kids and relationships. I don't always take that time, obviously, (actually only once in the last 15 years) but once in a decade is pretty reasonable in my opinion. Especially knowing that she's grieving over a lost child.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t need your permission", "OP why even post? The thread is overwhelmingly YTA and yet not one of your comments has shown any acknowledgement that maybe you're wrong or have some reevaluating to do. Your wife is overworked and needs some time away. Yes she'll still be working her job for those 20 days BUT  she won't be in mum mode. You seem weirdly unable to understand that. You've also mentioned that you would spend every moment with your kids if you could. But you haven't. You've spent 5 months a year away from them. Know who actually has experience of spending every moment with your kids? Your wife. Give her some damn time to herself", "YTA and I hope she goes", "YTA b/c you can disappear for a week at a time for work but she cant leave for her vacay?

She has more than earned a month vacation for herself.", "The fact that she\u2019s asking for and idealizing this much time with that many kids at home speaks to the decade of hard work with no time off and no mental escape from her family. YTA. Give her the month and gladly. Even if you think it\u2019s a lot. The fact that you\u2019re this worried or upset means you know how much she\u2019s shouldered and what you\u2019ll have to pick up when she\u2019s gone. Now multiply that over ten years and complain.", "YTA, by reading the comments you\u2019ve made ,you just don\u2019t want her to go bc your sexist and don\u2019t think she should be away from children for 20days. She is more then a mother , she\u2019s a person. You are unsupportive, controlling, and demeaning in this post towards your wife", "YTA. You're not the boss of her and your wife is still very young. She's probably on social media seeing friends having all kinds of adventures and wondering what might've been. Which doesn't mean she regrets her life with you and your kids, but it's got to be depressing to think that she might have to wait 10+ years to do anything like this.", "INFO: Is this an admission of your incompetence and incapability to parent your kids?", "YTA - it\u2019s 20 days away from you. Get over it. Raising kids is hard work - she deserves to get away and have fun in the way that she wants.", "YTA. This sounds like a really cool experience, and you should be happy for her. Being away from the kids a few weeks in a decade span is not indicative of some sort of deficiency as a parent. If that were the case, you\u2019re already way ahead of her! She\u2019s also role-modeling independence and healthy risk-taking for the kids. Like good god, I WISH my mom would have traveled on occasion when I was a kid. She\u2019d probably have been less depressed, which is good for everyone, and I wouldn\u2019t have had to be the one in the family trying to set the example for my younger sibling that taking a vacation doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna get mugged, eaten by a shark, or die in a fiery plane crash. It\u2019s not 1930, build her up and share her excitement, rather than trying to turn this trip into another drag she\u2019s got to manage a ton of stress around. After raising the kids, y\u2019all owe it to her to survive on your own for that short period of time.", "YTA! If you are able to afford this, let her do it. Is it possible that she has dreams and desires that don't involve you or her children? I would certainly hope so! As stated by others, she has spent her adult life catering to and caring for you and your children. Why on earth would she not want to spend time on her own? I guarantee she rarely gets to use the bathroom without someone knocking. I guarantee she hasn't gotten a Saturday morning that doesn't involve cleaning, meals and running errands. Not to mention hearing someone say \"I'm starving, there's nothing to eat\", on a regular basis. \n\nLet this lovely woman, who has done so much for everyone else for so long, have a break. To drink a cup of coffee undisturbed, to take a shower without company, to relax in a chair in the sun without worrying about what the kids are getting into. \n\nIf we could have afforded it, I would have done the same thing. Quit being so insecure and let her be her own person.", "It\u2019s twenty days out of the whole year versus your 4-5 months. She\u2019s right she has given up her youth to be a parent, a wife and a worker. What\u2019s so wrong about her wanting to breathe alone for twenty days !!! Being away from you and the kids dosen\u2019t make her love anyone less it just means she\u2019s a human and humans need time to breath and relax and recenter. \n\nSAH parents experience intense burnout and a sense of loss of identity, this could be the thing that keeps her off the edge. Ofcs YTA she\u2019s made all the arrangements and she\u2019s coming back, she\u2019s not going to cut contact she\u2019ll likely call and text everyday and it could strengthen your family bond and allow you to see things from her perspective too.", "I\u2019m not saying yta but traveling solo is so freeing.", "YTA. If I needed this time, I would take it regardless of your utterly selfish opinion. She is an autonomous human who is telling you what she needs.", "I mean in general premise, no it\u2019s not the greatest for a mom with multiple young kids to disappear for a month straight.

She\u2019s given the last 10 years of her life to you and your children. And all you can do is whine and make her feel guilty? She\u2019s literally asking for the first 10 days to be with YOU and the kids. It\u2019s not even on a whim either. It\u2019s well thought out and budgeted too. And bottom line, it very much means something to HER. You\u2019re so focused on the fact that if YOU don\u2019t understand why, she\u2019s not even allowed to do it. That\u2019s so beyond disgusting.", "YTA - plain and simple. My husband would willing allow that if we had support and the money. I would, in turn, be more than happy for him to get away too.", "ESH\n\nAs a mom of three, a whole month is a bit much. However, it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to want to get away with her family, then some time with her sister and some time alone. \n\nBeing the default parent gets taxing very quickly.", "YTA. This reeks of control. If you need help it sounds like you have a community to help support with child care. If its possible for her to do this, then she should.

Seems like reasonable compromise to leaving you for good.", "YTA, she isn't asking for much....some time to herself/self reflection is a good thing.  Being a stay at home mom since I was 20 myself I can make some assumptions as to why this is important to her.  It's hard to see who you really are when you are always around children.

The misandry is strong on this board.", "It\u2019s crazy y\u2019all are framing this towards only him when this is her mentality too. So much so that she wants to get away from them for an entire month for her 30th cause she lost her 20s. But if someone said \u201cmaybe don\u2019t have 3 kids in your 20s and no life outside of that\u201d to her it would be rude", "OP can be wrong overall/YTA, but not necessarily wrong about calling it a request. \n\nI think I'm a good partnership leaving for a 20/30 vacation is a request that should be discussed as a team. My partner and I have both travelled and left the other person with the kids for the weekend or a few days. We 100% talk it out and get it \"approved\" for lack of a better word, by each other. \n\nEven just going out with friends for the night we run by each other and get it approved. It is more like I am planning/want to do XYZ do you have any reasons it won't work?", "Nah mate, I\u2019d actually have the same opinion if it were the husband asking for the same amount of time. If the other parent is able to handle it then it should be okay to take that kind of trip. It\u2019s totally fine for a mom to take 20 days away from her kids one time for a big event like her 30th birthday, and it would be acceptable for a father too.", "It\u2019s different because the wives in these stories don\u2019t typically have any kind of life or identity outside of mothering their kids. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s messed up that he can have a work life and get to do things outside of parenting, but she can\u2019t take a two week break after years of child rearing.", "No it wouldnt be. This exact story has come many times. Men talking about a boys trip. Everyone is on the mans case about \u201cwhat about her??? does SHE GET ONE??? she isnt just a good obedient housewife you know!\u201d To say it would be the exact same reply is being willfully obtuse.", "I wouldnt be surprised if he is all of those things, and because you tolerate it and think it's \"normal,\" you think all other women should too. Not everyone is you. I have a young daughter and kicked my ex out of the house (my house) for his repeated bad behavior. I'm not a doormat, and I don't tolerate disrespect and double standards.", "I have read many of those posts with the genders revered. And when a man posts about wanting to take a 20 day vacation and has made childcare arrangements, has worked out all of the details with his job, has handled the emotional and mental burden of his own vacation etc then yes, he can take said vacation and should take said vacation. \n\nIn almost every post instead the man posting says \"My wife can figure it out.\" \"Why would I need to arrange for help or childcare?\" \"She gets breaks when the kids are sleeping.\" and on and on. \n\nBTW, my husband is taking a solo trip later this year. He is making all of the arrangements. He is handling himself. I am all for it. I hope he has a blast.", "I love how people keep saying \u201creverse the genders\u201d, like it\u2019s not totally common for men to have jobs where they\u2019re gone for extended periods of time, and women are just expected to deal with it.", "I would be absolutely saying the same thing. It\u2019s not unreasonable for a parent of any gender to want to do a three-part trip like this on a big event like a 30th birthday.", "It really sounds like she feels she made a mistake being a parent.", "When he travels for/to work? He not choosing where he\u2019s going. It really sounds like she\u2019s feeling she made a mistake being a parent.", "Ok so I don\u2019t know how to copy from the OP but he said it\u2019s:\n\n10 days with her husband and kids, 10 days with her sister and 10 days solo. \n\nThat adds up to 30 days total, 10 with the kids and husband and 20 without them. \n\nUnless there\u2019s an edit I missed, I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s 14 days.\n\nAnd I totally think yearly breaks are a great idea.. I just personally wouldn\u2019t do that long.. but to each their own. If I\u2019m going away without my husband and kids, it\u2019ll likely be a 4/5 day thing max. But I\u2019m not the OP\u2019s wife so she may feel like longer is better for her.", "What is this? The pain Olympics?", "I think you all are getting me wrong, and I suck at explaining myself. And my wording has sucks. I understand my wife has sacrificed a lot, as have I. When we lost our child, she stopped working for a year while I worked. I don\u2019t mind her going on vacation, we go on vacations. I do not think a MONTH is acceptable. We have always had help. Her mother nannied all of the kids until they were in school. She can go solo, with family, with a random friend I\u2019ve never met for all I care but she cannot leave for a month. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.", "No, not wrong, just unusual. I think when we call people assholes for things like this, we need to consider why it isn\u2019t the norm for married people to go on extended vacations alone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to do so, it just isn\u2019t generally done. And why that is, I\u2019m not sure.", "Have a fun and relaxing trip! Hawaii will be amazing !", "The primary argument that he is attempting to make is that she shouldn't be away from her kids for 20 days, though, even though he is frequently away from his kids for a week at a time, 4-5 months a year.\n\nAnd it honestly sounds like he isn't equally co-parenting, he is gone for work so she does the majority of the parenting and then when he is home, she probably still does most of the parenting.", "Yea I rescind my support of OP. As a man who has to work 60 hours a week and doesn't get to spend as much time with my little lad as I wish I did, I knee jerk jumped to the defense of someone who, upon further inspection, is indefensible.", "Are you kidding? This is Reddit. Divorce or brutal divorce are the only two options for relationship problems involving married couples.", "Where does he have an identity, other than parent and provider? Mom is parent and caretaker. Unless you want to allege that he has somehow had an easier time than she; then what applies to one, applies to both.", "Where are you seeing that she doesn't have an identity outside of being a mom or that she doesn't have a life outside of parenting?\n\nJust to be clear, I think the OP is definitely the asshole, but it's not like she doesn't have a job of her own as well. Just because she's a mother doesn't mean she lacks her own identity.", "That is pretty sexist and stereotype. A lot more men raise their kids today", "YTA, she has responsibilities. She made those decisions. If you flipped the role he would be crucified.", "I mean it's really more like 4 years of her life for just being pregnant, before you factor in any of the recovery time.", "Lol is that all you think an active partner and father does?", "Sir read his replies. What you have with your S/O is healthy but what he says about his S/O is alarming.", "I have never heard of a boys trip that long. Nobody with young kids gets to spend that much time away from them.", "So you just agreed with me\u2026 I\u2019m saying what you said you dolt.", "I go on 2 girls trips a year, get massages, manicures, pedicures, Latin dancing almost weekly, happy hours, dinner with friends\u2026 my husband hangs out with his friends once a month & has never taken a guys trip even though I\u2019ve pushed him to. I also control our family finances even though I don\u2019t work. My husband is definitely not a misogynist and is really great. He doesn\u2019t disrespect me. Don\u2019t project your issues onto others.", "You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about", "YES TO ALL OF THESE POINTS", "It\u2019s 2023 women have jobs that make them gone for extended periods of time too and the men are just expected to deal with it too. So I honestly don\u2019t get your point.", "Or marrying the dude. Like if the family is going to take the kids, could she have not brought him along? lol", "They both deserve time and space to process the death of their child. She's telling him what she needs and he is refusing to even entertain the idea despite her covering childcare, work, and travel in order to avoid putting undue burden on him. Something I'm not sure he would do if the places were reversed.", "Reread what you wrote just now about the mother of your children and consider if the way you're talking about her shows that you value her as an equal partner in this.", "It\u2019s not your wording it\u2019s your explicit and implicit sentiments, you\u2019re being read loud and clear and everyone is telling you like you are in this instance, an AH.", "Is it a month or is it just 20 days? You\u2019re saying two different things", "You leave for [FIVE months](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z3msl/comment/jrvyg4a/) every year! Why can\u2019t she leave for 20 days? Are you that incompetent as a parent?", "What are you afraid of? Why are you afraid of her being alone and taking time to take stock of her life? You not coming across well and not because you struggle to explain and justify your controlling behavior. Your post and responses just read me me me. I can see why she needs a break and think about herself. Not be mom and wife. She's carrying the family. YTA. If this is what she needs for her mental health, to center herself, or find her identity again, She should. There's a lot of resentment here reading between the lines.", "you her owner?", "Its not how your explaining yourself its how you dont respect your wife as a person. She is clearly telling you she needs, she has literally prepared everything for you, she has gotten permission from her job but because you have relied on her so much for your families \"routine\" your freaking out now cause she wants a vacation from it away from everyone. Like seriously your best excuse was cause your daughter only likes her to detangle her hair please you can learn or ask her mother or sister to to it. \n\nYour seriously being incredibly selfish by even arguing with her about it. Dont be surprised if she decides not to go and then later on she tells you she wants to separate or divorce.", "Then why are you here? It seems like you\u2019re already quite sure that you\u2019re right about this. What was your purpose in posting?", "She's going for 20 days and still working. You've asked and the question has been answered repeatedly. Grow up. Understand some people want a break. \n\nWhere are you precious children you need to spend every waking moment with except when you're traveling?", "sir, what aren\u2019t you understanding? she wants to go away, be away, stay away, away, away for 20 days. you and your children aren\u2019t more important than her self. she is a person who wants to spend some alone time away from you all. get a grip", "20 days is not a lot. YTA.", "It is not unreasonable if you add up all the traveling for work you do.", "It IS unreasonable that she can\u2019t have 20 days without you and your children after more than ten years of being their primary caregiver every single day, and picking up your slack while you travelled for work. You\u2019re unreasonable.", "I think you don't love your wife and this is all proof", "But I\u2019ll be honest, I wouldn\u2019t want my husband finding himself on a solo vacation", "being away from your kids out of financial necessity and for vacation is completely different. he \"shouldn't\" be either, but it is how he makes money and as such is a necessity.", "Except for the part he's gotten to leave her alone with the kids for a week at a time over the last 11 years. I'd be willing to bet real money the amount of time his business trips allowed for solo travel outside of business operation hours equals just as much or more as she wants to take for herself.\n\n\n\nThere's a big difference between being a stay at home care taker and someone with a job that allows them to make relationships with people their own age *and* travel.", "He didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with his identity until his wife wanted to take two and a half weeks for a milestone birthday. And that\u2019s fine. But this lack of identity obviously seems to be a bigger deal for her, so why shouldn\u2019t he support her in this?\n\nHe seems to only have thrown out the \u201cbut I missed out on those things in my youth, too, guys!\u201d argument when it looked like Reddit wasn\u2019t going to agree with him and call his wife a horrible mother.", "Just read through the comments and saw she has a job, and that she\u2019ll be working remotely. So I definitely stand corrected there. But her telling her family that she \u201cwants to be more than someone\u2019s mother\u201d is pretty telling. \n\nNot to mention the fact that OP says she wants this trip because she feels like she missed out on travel by getting pregnant so young.", "I\u2019m sure they do. OP has indicated in his comments that he doesn\u2019t.", "NTA. And OP has responsibilities to his wife. He needs to be a better partner and give her two and a half freaking weeks to herself.", "On top of that she is also working. Apparently she took a 'year off' according to op when they lost their oldest.\n\n20 days. She wants 20 days to herself. 10 of them with her sister.\n\nThat's not even three weeks. This woman has been busting her ass and risking her life for literally years and he's begrudging her *twenty days*", "I am not disputing that, the first part of my comment acknowledged that OP can be wrong/an ahole, but not be wrong for saying/calling it a request. \n\nHe might get 99 questions wrong but can still be right on number 100.", "That\u2019s actually not true at all, a parent can take personal time to travel with a friend and then alone for 20 days without harming their kids. And this goes for a mother or a father.", "Cool story. Enjoy that Latin dancing, hun.", "Cool, neither do you.", "My point is that it\u2019s not abnormal for one parent to look after the kids for an extended period of time without the other. She\u2019s going to be by herself working remotely while he handles the kids. So what\u2019s he whining about?", "What is she telling him because I haven\u2019t seen much in the post?

First you say it's not generally done but you have no idea why but then you say you wouldn't want your husband to do it. \nThat is the reason it is not generally done. You yourself gave the reason.", "And he is more than welcome to find a job that allows him to be home 24/7 also. Or ask to work remotely, like she did, so he too can go work in another city. But just because she is a mom doesn't mean she isn't allowed time alone, away from her kids and husband.", "He was traveling for work. Lots of airports, cramped, airplanes, and hotel rooms. Not glamorous.", "He\u2019s basically saying that he is dealt with the same issues, but has chosen not to complain because he understands the gig.", "Working remotely with kids while having feelings that they want to be more than someone's mother definitely indicates she's around her kids all day and not people her own age. She works in the same walls she raises her kids, there's no disconnect, and definitely no travel like OP gets to do. Everyone I know who takes business trips is able to enjoy the city outside of business hours.\n\n\nEdit: OPs comments say her mother and sister would watch the kids. He just doesn't want to \"disrupt their routine\" (ie: step in to do the things she usually does) and comb his daughters curly hair.", "Jealous much? I don\u2019t work. I\u2019m a SAHM. Love my life & my husband.", "In his post he states that she told him she's spent a decade taking care of him and the kids and wants 20 days away.\n\nAlso, he's the one that brought up their child's death I just asked if she'd had time to process the death. Typically women face the brunt of the work following a death (notifying friends and family, producing obits, catering if used, ECT.) Doing all of these things really take an emotional toll on a person and sometimes properly processing your grief gets put on the back burner.", "That\u2019s true I did say that.", "Yes travel tends to include airports, cramped, airplains, and hotel rooms. She'll face those exact same stresses during her travels. \n\n\nAnd her mom and sister apparently are gonna watch the kids while she's gone anyway so he doesn't even have to worry about that.\n\n\nPoint being he's had the chance to have an identity outside of caregiver the last 11 years and she hasn't. Being a provider is still an identity outside of caregiver, and especially when his provider status allows him to travel and have relationships with other adults.", "I'd lose my mind if I was a SAHM and allowed a man to pay all the bills instead of supporting myself. But you do you. Not my problem."]}
