Your husband's parents tricked you into paying for your SIL's room. They told you she wouldn't be coming, which was a lie in order to make you cover her portion. And considering that you're both saving money towards your own goals that's extremely unfair and deceitful.

You aren't going to be the one to change this dynamic, especially since your husband isn't willing to stand up about it.", "So her husband is going with? \n\nYou are in fact jealous. You want a baby but haven\u2019t because of financials. That\u2019s your decision. \n\nYou alone didn\u2019t pay her way. You, MIL and her brother are.

And the reason I \u201cdon\u2019t mind\u201d that my husband doesn\u2019t agree with me is because he\u2019s literally never cared about any financial wrong doing.

The trip dynamics are totally different. You are not being dramatic. Show your husband our responses. \n\nAnd yes, have him ask that the costs be changed to 1/3 divisions.

Also, we have no idea of the total!!!", "You\u2019re right. OP is only paying 1/4. I was wrong. MIL is paying half. OPs husband is paying the other 1/4. MIL can put whomever she wants in the extra room. It\u2019s her money.", "Actually OP says it is her money, so she IS paying half on behalf of herself and her husband.\n\nAnd if you want to do the dumb \u201cThey\u2019re married, so her money is his money\u201d argument, then MIL is also only paying 25% because FIL is also going.", "I would be more upset about the squalling baby than the money \ud83e\udd2e", "Mother invited sister so she can share her bathroom and you and husband get the other.

To your mil I would reply checkmate to her objections. And it\u2019s all been paid for now so too bad.", "Talk to your husband.  Make him understand this will be the last trip with his family ever if the same issue pop up.  \n\nNTA.  But your husband needs to understand you guys can not afford to keep doing these things for his sister because of his mom.  Its not fair to you or him.", "ESH\nTell MIL you aren\u2019t splitting it 50-50 and say you want them to pay 60-40 then. So are you just jealous or petty or both? Because it\u2019s ok to be either or both. Stand up and tell MIL you aren\u2019t paying for her to freeload", "That would piss me off too.", "Oh don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll pay for all that for her lol. We\u2019re talking about a woman that buys her granddaughters daily diapers formula etc and her daughters 26 yo. My SIL said she\u2019s legitimately never bought a single item for her own baby. I joked in another comment I should be happy my SILs coming because maybe I\u2019ll get my meals paid for by default just because she\u2019s there.", "Haha my sister has 3 young kids so I\u2019m half tempted to invite her. Good idea. I\u2019d like to bring it up pretending I\u2019m serious just to see the look on her face.", "3 bedrooms all right beside each other but only 2 bathrooms.", "Why are you saying this as if it's a bad thing?? A grandmother buying diapers and formula for her grandchild? And inviting her daughter to stuff? That's just nice of her. \n\nI understand that YOU don't want to pay for SIL, and are annoyed because you payed for half of the vacation. That's understandable.  But you also seem annoyed that MIL is generous with DIL. Why?", "I think you\u2019re missing the point that SIL is your MIL\u2019s daughter. I love my daughter in law but I\u2019ll be damned if she is ever going to tell me how I can treat my daughters. MIL can buy all the baby stuff she wants to for her grandchild. It is literally none of your business.  None. Zero.", "Maybe suggest you get a bigger place, then MIL and SIL can sort out the extra cost", "I'm inferring what she meant, but I think OP is more upset at the double standard compared with SIL than her MIL paying for baby necessities.", "Jealousy is all I can think of? I mean SIL is MIL\u2019s daughter. The baby is her grandchild. MIL can buy that baby a new car and it\u2019s none of OP\u2019s business.", "Unfortunately, I think you are stuck going on this trip. However while on the \"adults only\" vacay I would find a moment with mil to talk about future vacations. As in there won't be any. And the reason is, she changed everything about this vacation after she got yours and dh commitment to go and pay for half. The minute things started changing you and dh should have been at the very least consulted about these changes before everything is set in stone. It's not just the money, it's the fact that you're going to have a crying baby on your supposedly adult vacay. Also, someone will always have to stay behind with the baby and it's shouldn't be the two of you as you were not even consulted about all this. If you don't stand up for yourself, you will be drawn into these family vacays with your limited time off paying for things you shouldn't have to pay for doing things you don't want to do.", "NTA.  Your husband should tell MIL that since she offered SIL a bedroom, MIL now owes you two the difference between one-half and the two-thirds since she is now paying for two of the three bedrooms.", "NTA. You're absolutely right. Why is it always thus that people who are careful with their money or have worked hard to get where they are, are expected to pay for less successful siblings? It's not your problem she is tight on money right now and has a newborn. If your mother feels so sorry for her, she should go on a vacation with her and pay for her or go on a vacation with all of you and pay for both children equaly.", "Nta don't ever agree to a vacation again unless you organize it without 'an extra free room '.", "Tell your husband he is setting a precedent. You need boundaries NOW or it will happen again.\n\nTell your Mil SIL is welcome to come but the cost needs to be split accordingly =1/3 or at least based on room qm. \n\nDo not let mil think you are idiots or doormats not seeing her lies. She had the intention from the beginning or she wouldn't have booked a location with extra room and thus would have been cheaper for everyone.\n\nYou don't have money to throw away nor is she the one who decides what you do with your money so this Needs to be. Said loud and clear.\n\nOr as someone else suggested say to Mil\n\n 1. If she tries to pull a stunt like this again you cancel everything\n\n2 your SIL is paying for all food and entertainment as you and mil are paying for her room. They are not ok with that the split the cost correctly.( And this is not talking into account how your vacation Will be affected by having a baby there).", "Your comments completely confirm you care more about money than family. Why do you even know how much they make? Did you do their taxes? I don\u2019t get it. I could have said E S H until the pregnancy comment. None of what your SIL does or how she plans her pregnancies are any of your business whatsoever.", "If your FIL and MIL make so much money and if they are so concerned for your SIL, they should have taken all of you out on this vacation and pay for all of you.", "Make sure you get the bedroom with the attached bathroom if that's an option.  You paid 50%, so the in-laws, although they are the parents, don't automatically get the main bedroom. \nBesides, MIL is so close with her daughter and grandchild that it will be easier for them to share a bathroom rather than \"the kids \" \nAnd yeah, next time you make the arrangements and take control. Or, even smarter, go where you want on your own.", "You absolutely must do, then leave her guessing right up until the mil can see for herself.  She will learn that you have moved that you can and will play next time", "You only think you all have to cater to the baby.  Nap time sounds like the perfect time for you and your husband to head out for some quality alone time.  Go have a lovely time with your husband and let them sort themselves out. Lay claim to the main bedroom and bathroom. \nSilicone ear plugs are a godsend, and so is a white noise app. \nYour MIL manipulated you, but if you don't show irritation, it may serve to bother her while making your husband happy. Win-win.", "Just go and enjoy yourself and make sure it\u2019s the last time you subsidize her vacation.", "Although I would be disappointed if there was a next time.  Make sure you know the number of bedrooms in the holiday and have some Airbnb place of your choosing so she can\u2019t do it again on you", "But what exactly is the \"double standard\" here?\n\nThe grandmother is happy to help with raising her grandchild and it is actually  appreciated by said child's parents.\n\nThat is a good thing literally everywhere **but** this sub for some reason.", "But if hubby insists that you keep your mouth shut.", "But a mothers live is eternal, their hearts will always break over a loved one struggling and will always try to ease their burdens by any means.", "And the grandmother lied to op and made her and her husband pay more by booking something with an extra room=more expensive,  from the beginning. \n\nShe's an Ah. She wants to get her daughter a free vacation then she should pay for it alone not cheat and lie to others and make them pay for her.", "NTA. Turn down family vacations in the future. Plan for something that you and hubby want to do and have an amazing time.

If you were splitting this three ways where you and your hubby were on the hook for 2/3s, you\u2019d have a good argument, but if MIL is taking on more than her fair share...you\u2019d BTA.\n\nBut, MIL ITA to add a baby to the plans and to bait and switch.  As the financially contributing parties to this vacation, this situation should have been throughly negotiated in advance of the invite been offered to the SIL.", "NTA,  find out if your in-laws will give you the money back that you paid for the holiday and get a place for just you and hubby in the same place. This will end up being a health issue for you otherwise. Mentally and physically, as not sleeping and being uncomfortable in that house, will mess with you.\n\nAlso get hubby to talk to his mum as he's said but with you there, do that so his mum can't try her usual manipulation with him. As that'll also help him see how she treats him. Drop hints that any help she gives sil should also apply to her son too. As its playing favourites otherwise.\n\nStay strong hun, you've got this.", "YTA You sound very resentful of your MIL and SIL\u2019s relationship.  If you want you and your husb could ask to refund part of your money so you\u2019re only paying 2/5.  That would be fair.  If you two decide to do that and get pushback you could say \u201cIf I invited my sister to take the empty bedroom wouldn\u2019t-you think it fair she pay1/5?\u201c. If you do approach them then you and your husb mustdo it together and hopefully include your FIL.  If you\u2019re not careful you\u2019re going yo seriously damage your relationship with your MIL, if you haven\u2019t already.", "YTA sure maybe it doesn't seem fair but stop being so childish and petty.  Her being there isn't going to have any effect on the vacation you were already going to have.\n\nMaybe you should concentrate some of your energy into getting ehere you want to be instead of directing it toward jealousy and worrying about what others are doing.  Stop being a hater.", "I would wager that she values sister-in-law more because she has given her a grandchild...", "That was sarcasm, right...?", "You\u2019re assuming she lied.  OP made it sound like MIL invited SIL as an afterthought. We can\u2019t assume it was strategic..", "If you have an extra room  free you planned. \n\nRarely you  are lucky  to have an extra room and not pay more  cause when you search to book you give minimum .\n\n Also mil didn't bother to ask in advance if op and husband are ok with his sister coming and under what conditions - which considering the small baby makes her an even bigger Ah as she advertised to op the ' last child free vacation' .", "NTA - your MIL had planned this out.  If you are paying as much as MIL then you have as much of a  voice in who gets that room !  Store luggage in it ....", "NTA. I think some other posters are more reacting to the undercurrent of resentment in OP's letter about the SIL and husband having a child and accepting financial help from the parents.\n\nBut to the core issue OP asked about: In-laws plan a vacay and ask their son and OP to pay for half and say the SIL and husband aren't coming because they can't afford it *then* turn around and invite SIL to come for free after collecting half the cost of the rental from the OP. That is pretty shitty. You shouldnt host one kid and then ask the other to split the cost. MIL is the AH in this situation. \n\nHowever, her other financial help to her daughter and grandchild is none of your business and you need to let that go. Also the comparing how much you and your husband make versus how much they make. Life isnt a competition. Make the choices you want to make for your own life and don't get caught up comparing yourself to others.", "\"So were they until my SIL decided to get pregnant\" - there are a few situations where this could be different, but don't you mean \"My brother and his wife decided to have a kid\".

Tbh, I don't buy much for my daughter because my mom went in \"crazy grandma\" style when I was pregnant. I have to hide some activities from my mom so I can pay for them. It goes to the lenght that I randomly said, while talking to my sister ,that I wanted to redecorate and paint my kid's room and the next day my mom brought me 6 pots of paint of various colors. \n\nBut, she never made my sisters nor anyone else in the family pay for anything for me or my daughter.", "Oh this was totally planned this way, then.
