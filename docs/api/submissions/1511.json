Lisa\u2019s insecure about everything regarding her appearance and personality so she can be annoying. She often asks me for guy advice and it\u2019s annoyingly obvious that she doesn\u2019t understand social interactions quite well. She asked out friend if her forehead was off putting. In her defense, Lisa\u2019s going to SV counseling and therapy so I know she\u2019s trying but I\u2019m still annoyed by a lot of her questions. \n\nLisa and I went out with friends last night for a party but it ended early. As we walked to another party, Lisa mentioned a guy she has a crush on to Nicole. I overheard and said ew and that I couldn\u2019t imagine her in any sort of romantic or sexual context but I could with Frank and Nicole. I compared her Dora the Explorer and Anya Forger from SpyxFamily. Later on she mentioned her crush to Nicole again and I jokingly said he didn\u2019t like her and that I hope she knows that. I don\u2019t know the guy. \n\nLisa asked why I always have to say stuff like that to her. I said I just couldn\u2019t imagine her being sexual or romantic because she\u2019s like a stuffed animal and I don\u2019t see her as a woman. I asked her if she wanted me to and what the issue was if she didn\u2019t want to fuck me. Lisa just said it\u2019s not that she wants me to but that its weird I always tell her how \u201cunfuckable\u201d I find her unprompted. She was drunk and went on a listing things I say that directly tie into her insecurities and traumas. I explained each point and that she\u2019s my friend but we just aren\u2019t close yet and I don\u2019t find her ugly. Lisa said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with me not finding her attractive but she doesn\u2019t get why every conversation I tell her that. She went off on her own to meet other friends. \n\nNicole said that Lisa feels that I see her as a punching bag rather than a friend. She pointed out how I compliment every female friend except Lisa. Lisa is just a cutesy person and I don\u2019t find her attractive.\n\nAITA for calling my friend too cute for me to find her attractive?\n\nTl;dr - My friend Lisa is very insecure and has an adorable personality that I don\u2019t find attractive. I told her last night that I can\u2019t imagine her being sexual or romantic. I compared her to children and a stuffed animal and said her crush probably doesn\u2019t like her back as a joke and she went off saying I always call her \u201ctoo cute to fuck.\u201d Our friend agrees I say wild stuff to her that makes it sound like I find her repulsive.
