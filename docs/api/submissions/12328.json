Nobody else had that information available to them, nor was there any discussion, agreement, or assumption that streaming services are a group charge for the household. In fact if there is any assumption on what the correct course of action is, the precedent was set that nobody pays anyone, as nobody has paid anything for existing services, they simply share what they have.\n\nThe roommate's ignorance of his financial affairs are not his roommates' responsibility to mitigate the consequences of.\n\nHe can ask that the house pay a split going forward, and choose to close the account if they decline.", "\u201cbased on the information that available to him at the time of making the deal with his roommates.\u201d\n\n1.

You're waaayy overthinking this. The agreement is, you use mibe and I can use yours. It literally doesnt matter where it comes from?

Roommate messed up. Roommate needs to pay the bill HE accrued.", "This isn't an accurate analogy at all. A more correct version would be if a handyman gave them a quote and one person stepped up and said their parents would pay for it so the group accepted the service. The handyman does the work, then the parents refuse to pay the bill. At that point it would be unfair to ask the others to chip in bc they never had a chance to decline the service, look for cheaper quotes or attempt the repair on their own.\n\nIn OPs case, he and the other roommates used the streaming service with the clear understanding that they didn't have to pay. They were told after the fact that they did have to pay. If the roommate the HBO belonged to had his shit together he could have told them before hand that they would need to split the cost, and they would've had the option to decline and just not use the service.", "Almost! But your analogy isn't quite right. The actual analogy would be that that so and so says *before* the handyman comes that his parents are paying for it, and the roommates agree on that basis.\n\nIf that turns out to be wrong, the fault lies with the person who said they didn't have to pay. The roommates may have made a different choice about whether to engage the handyman if they knew it wasn't being paid by the parents, so it is unfair to demand they pay for something they didn't have an informed choice about. \n\nThe house could choose to contribute, which is what OP is actually doing out of goodwill, but it's out of goodwill, they don't have an obligation to, because if they'd known it was charged they would not have used it.", "And OP is paying. But they're not obligated to, they're doing it out of goodwill, and they're entitled to be annoyed about it.\n\nThe point is to recognise that - the roommate screwed up, and the cost is on him. OP is not an AH to be unhappy about being sprung with an extra cost because of someone else's mistake. \n\nIf they chose not to pay it, they'd  still be within their rights. $34 can be a lot when you're unemployed. \n\nSo if the argument is 'it's only $34, be a good friend!', that could be equally applied to the roommate who's on 6 figures while his friend is unemployed. \"Sucks to be you buddy! I know you're broke and unemployed and didn't agree to spending this money in the first place, but I didn't check my bank account for 7 months because this amount is so insignificant to me I didn't notice it at all, so now I want you to pay me for it!!\" See how that goes both ways?", "What?", "aall are aware that the stuff costs something, all went into the agreement based on the assumption it was free to them.\n\ntheir side of the bargain, actuall<y, all are in on the bargain, meaning to explore wether they have any duty from the bargain is also on them.", "Lmao. And yours isn't accurate either imo. Someone has to pay the bill. And I can gaurentee that the roommate who's credit card was charged, did try and fail to get his parents to pay. They used the service. They should pay the bill. Maybe if people weren't so fucking stingy in paying for things they use....\n\nDone with you too. Please and kindly... fuck off", "Oh horseshit. Because NONE OF THEM knew/agreed to anything. They all assumed mommy and daddy would pony up. Just like as if a handyman was called and showed up. And when mommy and daddy didn't (cuz I can gaurentee so and so tried and failed to have mommy and daddy pay the HBO max bill) they all started to panic. Hence this post.\n\nAnd now I'm done with you. I'm so happy that you have such an idealic community and life up there in lalaland, but down here on planet earth, us humans don't always get or have what you describe. Go ahead and try to insult my character some more as if it is somehow always the other person fault. I'm sorry you didn't like my original crude attempt at humor (which btw, my get a hotel and hire movers bit is actually a quote from Barney Stinson). But I'm bored now.

And just because you're clearly losing the argument doesn't mean I have to \"fuck off\". You don't get to decide what I get to comment on. If your ego is so fragile that you can't handle a few people calling out your lack of understanding on how life works, then you should probably trade in your internet access for a comfort blankie and some therapy, bc with you're attitude it's not gonna get any easier.", "You think mutual aid and community comes from being in lalaland and having more than others?\n\nIt comes from struggle! It comes from having *less* and having to deal with the reality of that. Needing to help each other because no one else will and ain't no one got the money to be paying cash for everything that needs to be done. \n\nThe strongest community comes out of the hardest situations, not the easy ones, because that's how people get through it. \n\nI meant it when I said I'm sorry if you don't have that, but I also meant it when I said it's a terrible take to say no one should ask for help from others. \n\nNo, I didn't recognise your quote, but you doubled down on arguing like it's what you believe, so yeah, I do think it's worth pushing back on that, and I hope you can see it differently at some point."]}
