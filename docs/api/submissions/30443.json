My boyfriend is a single father of two children 17M and 4M. They are great kids and really don\u2019t have anything to do with the story. Just needed to be mentioned for context. I do not have any children.\nBeing a single father, he works two full-time jobs to support his kids. I also have two jobs, but I work significantly less as they are both rather well paying and have less expenses. As we both work a lot, you can imagine we don\u2019t get to spend a lot of time together. This definitely puts a strain on our relationship, but we have tried our best to make it work as we both love each other deeply.\n\nSince I have more free time, I tend to spend a lot of this free time with my two closest friends. Both of whom are stay at home wives. We like to go to brunches, spa days, movie nights, festivals. Basically, just having fun and enjoying life. My boyfriend often jokes about my \u201clife of frivolity\u201d and \u201cwishes he could have as much fun as I do\u201d\n\nLately, he\u2019s been trying to convince me to use some of my free time to get another job so he can take time off of work because he would like to do those things with me. He said, \u201cwith all my free time a part-time job making like a few hundred bucks a week shouldn\u2019t be so hard\u201d and he would be able to work less and spend more time with me. While I would love to spend more time with my boyfriend and can admit that secretly, sometimes I would prefer to be out doing these things with him. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair that I get another job to subsidize his income. He immediately got defensive and told me it wasn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t understand because I don\u2019t have kids and that he needed to work as much as he did for his children.\n\nThis is where I may have been an A**hole. I told him it was ridiculous for him to expect me to pay to spend time with him. He told me I was being childish and not listening to the situation. Simply he could not afford to work less, and desperately wanted to spend more time with me. He figured since I could earn more money in less time than he could that I should work a little more so he could work a little less. I again told him I would not pay to spend time with him and the conversation and quickly deteriorated. \n\nI just need to know  AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nWe\u2019ve been together about a year and we live about 45 minutes apart \n\nHe does work 80 hours a week \nI work anywhere from 35-45 hours a week\n\nMe agreeing and working an extra 10-15 hours a week would mean he would only have to work around 60 hours.\n\nWe do not share finances\n\nHe is overall a great boyfriend, and I do see myself spending the rest of my life with him. \n\nWe have openly talked about the future together. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nHe is actively looking for ways to earn more and work less\n\nThis would be \u201ctemporary\u201d, but there\u2019s no saying how long ", "created_utc": 1699283811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p50o4/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_boyfriend/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me get this straight; your boyfriend wants you to get a **third** job, **give him the money from said third job so he can work less,** and then spend what little free time you have left with him, thus cutting out your time spent pursuing your own interests and hobbies with your friends.  \n\nWhy would he even think you would, or should, do such a thing?  Your bf apparently thinks he hit the cash lottery with you.  Your bf is the AH.", ">My boyfriend often jokes about my \u201clife of frivolity\u201d and \u201cwishes he could have as much fun as I do\u201d\n\nI hate it when people say passive aggressive things like this. \n\nIt's not a joke. He meant it and has passed it off as a joke. \n\nYour life is yours and you get to spend your money whichever way you want and people can keep their little digs to themselves. \" It must be nice to be able to do xyz \" ... Yes, yes it is nice, Barbara. Let's move on. \n\nHe was definitely asking you to work more so you can spend time together - and I think you've reached an impasse, because once you move in together, he fully expects you to subsidise his income. Which is fine , lots of couples do that - but your expenses would considerably increase because of him and his kids solely so he's one who stands to gain a lot more from this deal. \n\nAre you okay with that? That's something you need to decide for yourself.\n\nEdited - forgot to add NTA", "NTA but this story is missing a lot of important context. Do you live together? Do you share expenses? How much do you both actually work? If you live together then your free time/income all needs to be factored together to find more equal solutions. It\u2019s a more nuanced conversation. If you are just dating then obviously your work/income doesn\u2019t impact him at all and what he\u2019s suggesting sounds like you giving him an allowance to supplement his personal income and pay his personal expenses in return for spending time with you. Which I wouldn\u2019t do either. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t even imagine a boyfriend saying, \u201chey why don\u2019t you get another job so you can give me that money and in return I\u2019ll come do fun things with you that you normally do with your friends\u201d.", "NTA. He wants you to work 3 jobs? 3? Because he had a kid at 21 and then another in his thirties? Nah, that doesn\u2019t sound fair or healthy for you", "NTA. Your boyfriend is wrong for assuming that the two of you would have merged finances. Married people sometimes merge their finances, but not always. Bf and gf do not merge their finances, and with his scheme he is actually expecting you to pay to spend time with him.", "NTA. You are being taken for granted.\n\nIn a relationship, it's important for both partners to support each other, but this doesn't necessarily mean taking on additional work to subsidize the other's income. Your time is valuable, and how you choose to spend it is up to you, especially since you've worked hard to be in a position where you can enjoy your free time as you see fit.Your boyfriend's situation is undoubtedly challenging, and his desire to spend more time with you is understandable. However, suggesting that you should get another job so he can work less places an unfair burden on you. It's not your responsibility to change your work-life balance to alleviate the pressures of his responsibilities, especially when it comes to financial matters and personal time.\n\nIt's also concerning that he labels your lifestyle as a \"life of frivolity\" and then asks you to alter it for his benefit. A more constructive approach would be for both of you to discuss ways to manage your time together within the current constraints of your lifestyles and work schedules, without expecting one another to make unilateral sacrifices.  \n\n\nThe conversation might have deteriorated, but it seems this was due to the strain of the situation rather than any intentional wrongdoing on your part. It's worth revisiting this discussion when both of you are calm and can talk about your needs and capabilities without judgment or unrealistic expectations.", "NTA\n\nIgnore anyone commenting that somehow you are on the hook for him being able to work less. If he wants to work less he can do something to improve his own life. You are not responsible, financially or any other way, for making his situation better.", "He wants you to work three jobs, in order for him work less and you both can make more stuff together? \n\n>. I told him it was ridiculous for him to expect me to pay to spend time with him.\n\nThis is exacly right! At the end of the day you would work THREE JOBS, a lot of hours, while he would be enjoying more free time! Plus, you would be paying for more and, probably, for his kids stuff. \n\n\n>Lately, he\u2019s been trying to convince me to use some of my free time to get another job so he can take time off of work because he would like to do those things with me. He said, \u201cwith all my free time a part-time job making like a few hundred bucks a week shouldn\u2019t be so hard\u201d and he would be able to work less and spend more time with me.\n\nHow YOU having a third job will make YOU have more time to be with him? He will have more free time? Yes. But you? Dont seem so. He just wants the extra money. \n\nIt would be on thing, if he had ask you for some money. But to ask you to work more hours to have more couple time? Something doesnt seem right.\n\nIf he dont make enought money with two jobs, he can look for better ones. You are not obligated to work more and pay more just because you dont have kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you don't share finances, you don't live together, nor are you married, so why should you work more and hand over money so he can work less? That sounds completely unreasonable at such a stage in the relationship.\n\nThe hours you work also look like a healthy amount, I wouldn't work more hours than that unless absolutely necessary. Besides that, couldn't he in theory reduce the hours he works if both of you were to live under the same roof. Total expenses would be cut down that way, thus requiring less income? Seems a far more logical route to take once your relationship gets to that point.", "But... how are you going to spend time with him while working three jobs? I don't get the logic here", "You subsidizing him being reckless with his seed is absolutely ridiculous. He created the financial liability and now he\u2019s trying to guilt you into being responsible for it.  It\u2019s about time for you to move on and find someone more suited to your situation. It will only get worse with him and the conversations will only get more heated and intense. NTA.", "NTA but you've chosen to be in a relationship with an older man with 2 kids and 2 jobs and no time and no money. Doesn't sound like a very fulfilling relationship.", "NTA. Time to bounce", "His responsibility is to do what he needs to in order to have the time and money for dating.\nYou\u2019re right, he wants you to subsidize him so he can spend more time with you. He sounds like he\u2019s looking for a sugar mommy. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are correct you shouldn't become his cash cow. You don't mention how long the two of you have been together but I don't feel like its been that long if his youngest if 4.   You are already working two jobs you don't need to get another one to support him.  17 and 4 is a large gap in ages which leads me to suspect different baby moms.  You were smarter about birth control then your boyfriend and that shouldn't put extra burden on your shoulders. They are not your children.", "I would suggest talking to him about why he feels you should overwork yourself because he decided to have kids? You don\u2019t have an issue with the kids but you would be filling in part of his income that he would use for his kids. You guys also need to talk about priorities and future plans. He\u2019s looking for this long term partner that will help support him and his kids. You\u2019re NTA but this needs to be a conversation. Maybe he needs to get a better paying job? That would also help", "NTA, you working 3 jobs so he can work 1 job is ridiculous. If he needs the money, but wants less time working, he should look into ***better paying jobs*** rather than put more of a burden on you. There's nothing stopping him from looking into a job that'll pay him more.", "NTA. One thing men have is the audacity.", "I also can\u2019t stand when people that have children put you on a pedestal because you don\u2019t have children \nHe chose to have kids you didn\u2019t, he made a life choice to have kids.. you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to care emotionally physically or financially because of his choices. \nHe gets to reap the up and downs of having kids. And you get to reap the benefits ups and downs of not having kids.", "Nta. You do live a more balanced life than him and have less expenses than him. This is by design.\n\nHe chose the life he lives by having sex. Regardless of why he is now single, he is acting like you two are married and that it's your obligation to make his life easier. He is using time together as a carrot on a stick.\n\nI think you both should think about the choices you make in life and how they've landed you both here today. Do you have the strength to haul around all that baggage?", "You are correct.  You'd be supplementing his income.  NTA to say no.", "NTA. Your BF works two jobs to generate the income he needs to support himself and his kids. Kudos to him for living within his means, if only barely. If he wants to improve his situation, he needs to look for ways to either improve his income or lower his expenses.\n\nHim asking you to take on another job to supplement ***his*** income is, as you said, ridiculous.\n\nDepending on the state of your relationship, him suggesting moving in together as a way to reduce his housing expenses and by extension allow him to work fewer hours might be reasonable. Him suggesting you get a third job and straight up give him the money is laughable.\n\nThat's not a reasonable request at all.\n\nIs he a paid escort? Or a straight up gigolo? You're entirely justified in refusing to pay for his company.", "NTA. You're not a sugar mommy. But should you decide to move in with this guy and become common law/married, this discussion will have  to be had and agreed terms resolved bc finances will at least be partially joint by that point.", "NTA. Do not in any means allow this man to start dictating your working more  to supplement his income at this stage in your relationship", "WTF? You don't even live together and he wants you to do what? Pay for everything? Tell him to get a better paying job that doesn't require 80 hours a week.  NTA...but once you agree to this, then it's going to be asking you to get a FT job so he can \"spend more time with you\"...then it's going to be get a second FT job so he can quit and find the best job for him...then it's going to be you paying for everything so he can find himself...Take this relationship with the concession to it's logical course and see if this is still someone you want to spend the rest of your prison senten...I mean life in prison, I mean life with.", "So he wants you to work another job and give him the money so he can work less? I don't see any other way for this to play out if you don't live together and don't share finances. No. Just no. NTA. This sounds insane.", "NTA, if he wants to work as an escort, that\u2019s his choice, but he can\u2019t expect you to work more hours to pay for his time.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to financially care for his children. \nBut I would hold a conversation: where do you see us physically and financially heading in 1 year, 3 years and 5 years and 10 years\nIf your goals are not comparable I would end it. \nHaving a relationship shouldn\u2019t be a compromise to your happiness and long term achievements.", "Nope. You already work 2 jobs. Your free time is just that : yours. Your BF is being a cheeky fuck quite frankly. His situation, whilst I sympathise, is not of your making.", "Money is the #1 cause that couples break up.  You have a lot of things working against your relationship already, 45 minutes apart, he works two FT jobs and has two kids, you seem to be a lot more financially stable.  You two need to decide what's most important to you.  He seems to be drowning in work and responsibility while you have a lot more free time and at least some extra money.  Neither is bad, you just need to figure out what you want to do.  You are NTA though for not subsidizing his lifestyle.", "NTA. This is a completely irrational request. I hope you can see that and are rethinking \u201cspending the rest of your life with him.\u201d", "Why doesn\u2019t he start looking for a higher paying job?", "You are out of his league, kick him to the curb.", "NTA. Congrats on being a girlfriend to a gold digger because that's exactly how it sounds.", "If you don't live together and share finances how will YOU working more mean he can work less?  Is he suggesting you work more AND give him the money?  For me that would be a hard pass.\n\nSPOILER ALERT it will NOT be temporary", "NTA.

Its insane for him to ask you to work more so you can \"spend more time together\". I would be personally reconsider your future together if he would be struggling on 60 hours a week. Is he living outside his means or what's going on? Gambling.. drugs,, debts? Where is it going? I think he could end up sucking you dry both financially and in a life style sense (More work less friends / rest)", "Given the fact that the pair of you do not share finances, you would in fact be paying him for his time and that's not what you want. Would that not make him feel a bit like a gigolo (I had to Google how to spell it, I'm not new, just bad at spelling) because it would if it were me and the shoe were on the other foot? I'm not suggesting this by the way because I don't think the pair of you are in a healthy place for it, but I would be looking at ways to reduce expenses like sharing a household, which then might encourage you to share finances and then it wouldn't be paying him to spend time with you. Honestly, I think he's probably trying to find an easy (for him) solution and not looking at you in that equation which I find really worrying. I wouldn't necessarily go back to him with the same terminology, but I would ask him why he thinks it's acceptable for you to take on a whole new job to subsides his lifestyle simply because he doesn't have the earning capacity to achieve it himself. Should you take on a fourth job so he can afford a Ferrari? No, don't be ridiculous. Well, why is that so much more ridiculous? Honestly, I would question your compatibility given that your lifestyles are so different and he can't handle the jealousy from that.", "NTA. \n\nYou shouldn't have to work 3 jobs totaling 60 hours a week just because he doesn't have his shit together as well as you do. \nEven if you do this ridiculous proposal, where/when will it end?  He is always going to want more of you. \n\nYou're only a year into this..time to move on.", "NTA. He\u2019s also made the rather entitled assumption that if you did work more, you would be subsiding his income. That\u2019s the definition of both being entitled and expecting wife privileges for girlfriend prices.\n\nOP, he has to work more because he has children to pay and care for. They\u2019re his children and this was his choice, not yours. Even if you did share finances (which is irrelevant IMO), his children are his responsibility and not yours unless you two marry and you choose to adopt them too.\n\nShut this one right down. It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s burned out but that was through his choices and not yours. It May be that you two aren\u2019t compatible if you can\u2019t agree on this and that\u2019s okay, but do not cave to his demands.

You're not the a-hole, and you're absolutely right that he's expecting you to pay for spending time together. It's seriously messed up. \n\nAnd lastly, it took me a really long time and some seriously shitty relationships to understand that sometimes love just isn't enough when measured against things that make you feel disrespected and manipulated by your partner. Ask yourself if you would ever expect him to work three jobs if he was the higher earner under the guise of spending more time together. I'm guessing not no, but hell no. If you would never ever try to put him in such a selfish situation, why should you be okay with him going so far out of bounds? \n\nFind a partner that respects you, loves you without conditions, and knows where to draw the line.

Also, I am not sure your free time with him will be the same as free time with your social circle. And, you will have less free time if you take on another job to support his kids and pay his bills.\n\nIf you are serious about this relationship and think of these kids as yours and want to work to support them, that is your choice.

The whole point of a relationship is having a partner. And too many people think love alone is enough without considering goals and what you want to accomplish in life and whether or not the person/people you're considering are conducive to those goals.\n\nIf you want a vote, NAH. I just see two different people with two different perspectives on how they think their lives should look. You need to figure out your priorities and what you're willing to sacrifice.

AND give up her free time for him.", "> I don\u2019t think her working 3 jobs so he can work less is a priority.\n\nBased on her post, her working \"three jobs\" still implies fewer hours than he'd be working at two full-time jobs (80 hours a week). In fact, the way she's describing things, her two part time jobs don't even sound like they add up to a single full-time job.\n\nThat's not to say it couldn't be a ridiculous ask in some circumstances, but she's not describing it as her already being overworked and him being lazy.", "It is if she wants there to be more time for them both together. Ultimately that's the choice. Time", "It's not an AH move to look for ways to spend more than me with your partner.", "That edit did not exist when I made my post  :)", "Oh my bad, yeah, read the M as months.", "Oh, yeah, I'm not at all saying that he's right in this situation. Simply that this is probably where his request is coming from, even though it's entirely unreasonable.", "Did you read the edit?\n\nShe only works 35-45 hours per week, in total. That's barely even the equivalent of one job. \n\nHe works 80. \n\nIf she really wants to spend her life with him, time to make some sacrifices.", "Lol. Yes, that\u2019s in the Edit to the post, which was written after I made my request for that info to be added.", "Oh yes, great idea, lets all snap our fingers and let a better-paying job fall into our laps!\n\nFor fuck's sake, get back to reality, people.", ">and give up her free time along with it to spend any time left with just him.\n\nAnd how long until the ask is to spend time with just him and the kids ... then just the kids ...", "Yeah!  She should dump him and do what every other woman does:  find a wealthy sugar daddy who will throw money at her and doesn't have any financial needs so that she, too, can be a stay-at-home wife doing nothing.  I mean, what kind of IDIOT dates a working man these days?  They have no time for you AND they expect you to contribute financially to the family dynamic!\n\nI recommend trust fund babies or retirees over 70.  Good luck OP.", "That 17 year old is raising the 4 yo. I have no doubts about that.", "And she will be paying for those kids.", "Those two things aren't mutually exclusive....", "Nobody is saying they should but if you are in a serious relationship then you need to learn to compromise and find a way to make things work. That's why it's called a partnership.", "He does, he works 80 hours a week to provide, lol. For the record, I'm not agreeing that OP should subsidize him, I'm simply pointing out that to me, being in a relationship means helping each other better themselves. All I see on here is people advocating for people to be self centred.", "No. He can figure his own shit out so he makes more money. Not so his gf has to work more to ease his load.", "It is an AH move to ask your partner to work three jobs so you can work less. There\u2019s a lot of info missing here, but in the surface that does not seem reasonable or fair it seems exploitative", "and your point is? the information was provided and answered your questions. your assumptions were wrong.", "lmao that\u2019s not what i said. it\u2019s a start because having op subsidize him is not a long term solution. maybe read what was actually said before getting so angry. you seem out of touch", "He has a gf who has better paying jobs so she may have some insider knowledge and even connections to getting a better paying position.. \n\nYou are being hyperbolic..", ".....are you the boyfriend? Because you sound like you might be the boyfriend she's talking about.", "Jumping to sexism because she won\u2019t subsidize his lifestyle is ridiculous. She is working and makes more than enough and you\u2019re comparing her to sugar babies and calling her names? You truly are a sad individual", "They don't share finances. He's not even asking her to share finances. Hes asking her to take on a share of his responsibility.  Taking care of an adult and his kids aren't this girls responsibility. If he wants free time he should try to better himself and get a decent job so he just works 40 hrs wkly. Not take advantage of someone that cares about him.", "If she chooses that, she can live without the additional time with him. That's her choice.", "Work less so they can spend more time together.\n\nIt's not being described by the OP as like he wants the time to go waste it. It's about freeing up time to be together.\n\nSo it's not an AH question, it's a relationship one. Does the OP want that extra time together or not?", "No. My assumptions were as reasonable as any other assumptions at that point in time, with the info provided. I admitted in my comment that they were likely (and intentionally!) underestimated. \n\nWhich was the point I was making to OP - and which I think that ***she*** understood. \n\nI don\u2019t feel the need to edit my first comment with a judgment - it won\u2019t become the top comment, because it\u2019s now out-dated. \n\nIt has however moved the conversation on, and satisfied my curiosity, which were my 2 goals.", "1. Yes it is what you said\n2. Why isn't it a long term solution?  Most marriages have one partner who earns a lot more than the other.  They then rely on that partner to \"subsidize\" the family to free up the other partner to tend other things (raising kid, dealing w/ home, etc).", "She doesn\u2019t choose that. That\u2019s the whole premise of this thread.", "It IS her choice and he called it \"frivolous.\" That makes him an AH in my book.", "That\u2019s really exploitative in my opinion. Sure he wants to have more free time to spend with his significant other. He also has responsibilities. His solution it\u2019s finding ways to make more money and work less himself, it\u2019s for her to work more. That\u2019s not reasonable", "I think ur and bf argument would have more ground to stand on if they were married and already sharing finances but they aren't so it IS over the line to ask", "it\u2019s absolutely exploitative. he can look for other better paying jobs if it\u2019s important to him but asking her to subsidize him because of choices he made is absolutely ridiculous. they\u2019ve only been together for a year and don\u2019t live together.", "you thought two full time jobs resulted in 15 hours of work a week lmao, that\u2019s not reasonable by any means.", "no it\u2019s not, learn how to read. they aren\u2019t married, don\u2019t live together and don\u2019t have combined finances. he is responsible for his finances and expecting his gf of a year to pick up the slack is ridiculous. you\u2019re really angry about this, seems it struck a nerve.", "If only money could magically appear. Life doesn't work that way. He's put forward a logical solution that is fair and reasonable. If the OP doesn't want that solution that's fine, that's their choice.", "The BF's request is fair and reasonable. But equally it's fair to say no to it. If the OP doesn't want that extra time together at the cost, that's fine.", "It's not exploitative in the slightest.\n\nHow do you know he hasn't looked for better jobs?", "~~Haha. Read it again~~.\n\n~~Boyfriend has \u201ctwo full time jobs\u201d as per original post. Which I guessed correctly was 80 hours~~. \n\n[lol - I see you\u2019ve edited your comment from 80 to 15. I\u2019ll remove my response to that part.]\n\nOP described her work life as \u201ctwo jobs\u201d (doesn\u2019t say full time) and her hours as \u201csignificantly less\u201d allowing her to spend \u201ca lot of my free time\u201d with non-working friends. \n\nWhich could put her hours *even across both jobs\u201d at anything from 5-55 hours a week. There was literally no way to accurately know from the original post. \n\nHence me (and others) asking for clarification.\n\n**ETA: maybe you don\u2019t know people who do high paying jobs with limited hours per contract. Eg consultancy**. \n\n**For those people, living off 15 hours a week is totally possible if their expenses are low - which OP says in her original post that they are**.", "He basically asks her to pay him for the time he spends with her. He wants to be her escort, not her bf, and she\u2019s supposed to work more to pay him for his time.", "I notice he didn\u2019t put forward the solution of him finding a more profitable job or trying to cut his own expenses, he also seems ready to spend money doing fun stuff with her. So why the solution is for her to get a 3rd job eludes me", "it is absolutely not fair or reasonable. if he wants more free time and more money, he can look for a better paying job instead of expecting his gf to subsidize his lifestyle.", "The cost is too high he's asking her to sacrifice her time and income on him on a weekly basis with no end point in sight. If he takes issue with how little he's making or how much he's working HE needs to take steps to improve it not ask his partner to do so at her expense. It's very unreasonable", "it absolutely is exploitative. you keep parroting the same thing without actually providing anything to the conversation lmao. even if he\u2019s looking for better jobs, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is currently asking his gf to subsidize his life", "How do you he didn't? How do you know he hasn't done both?", "It's completely fair and reasonable. It's also fair and reasonable for her to say no. \n\nYou don't think of looking for better jobs might already have been thought of?", "How do you know there is no end in sight?", "Parroting the same thing? Have you read what you post?", "Because it wasn\u2019t mentioned. What was mentioned in the post was him asking his partner to pick up another job so he could work less. Why invent something that isn\u2019t there?", "it\u2019s not fair or reasonable in the slightest. his financial gaps are not op\u2019s responsibility at this stage in the relationship. even if he is looking for better jobs, if he hasn\u2019t found one then he needs to continue finding a way to make it work by himself. op is not there to subsidize his lifestyle because he can\u2019t afford it", "because of his parental obligations and lower earning capacity than hers. SHE would be subsidizing his kids so that he would have free time with her getting a third job."]}
