It can't be forced.\n\nUnfortunately some parents, like your dad and stepmom, do understand that. They have a cartoon vision of some Halmark perfect blended family and demand that the kids twist and mold themselves to fit that vision. Unfortunately life does work like that and everybody (including themselves) suffers from there demands. \n\nI'm sorry the situation has gotten so crazy for you.

Rather than the acceptance and support you need(ed) and deserve(d), your grief and love for your mom has been devalued and attacked. That's why you have these valid feelings that your stepmom has never been a mother to you. What you thought, felt and needed weren't heard, validated or supported. Her image of what you should be is what she loved and supported, up to and including attacking what you actually are that deviates from her imaginary you. Real you is a barrier to her imaginary you.
