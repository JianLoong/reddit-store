For me she is dad's wife though it bothers her and my dad more when I call her stepmother because it sounds very formal and cold to them. My mom wrote all of us kids books of letters before she died which covered every major milestone and just general letters for us to read whenever. My siblings wanted her to add letters to theirs. She decided she would take mine as well and add to it even when I said no. I tore them out and she stuck them back in and added more. She cried and said it hurt her that I tore out her meaningful words. Another time she changed a few of the photos in my room to ones after she married my dad. She took out one of me and mom on my 1st birthday and another of all of us before mom died. Stuff like that is not uncommon. I burned the pages last time so she couldn't just put them back in.\n\nI always try to get out of Mother's Day because I do not want to celebrate her but always got told I had to, she's the mom of the household, that I was being mean and unfair to her (this came from my dad).

So I arranged with my grandparents (maternal) to have them pick me up after everyone went to bed and I stayed at their house. My dad and his wife woke up about an hour ago and realized what I had done. They have been blowing up my phone ever since. She left a voice message crying that I broke her heart and why do I hate her so much and want to ruin her Mother's Day.

I\u2019m sorry you had to go through all that, my dads wife has never tried to parent me as I was 33 years old when they got together and I put in a big effort but it was sort of ignored or brushed off and now calls me a stranger and she never gets to see me and I have always been polite and respectful to her but she not always to me.

She has crossed so many boundaries it\u2019s no wonder that you don\u2019t like her! both her and your dad are the assholes here, your dad should never have let her force herself into your life like that, and she needs to be more accepting that she can\u2019t just take your moms place. Id suggest getting a lock box of some kind to keep the stuff you have from your mom in, that way stepmom can\u2019t mess with anything again and potentially ruin it.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your father can\u2019t seem to comprehend how wrong it is to try and replace your mother with his second wife.

Dad should be setting boundaries, your the \u201cchild\u201d she\u2019s the adult. But that\u2019s a perfect world scenario. The only thing I want to ask you, do you think your siblings will be hurt by this? If the answer is yes, you need to do some thinking for their sake.", "ESH sorry but\n-your step mother sucks for not respecting your boundaries. She want to be your mother. You don\u2019t. While your siblings maybe younger and are happy to have her in than role she should stop to force it on you. I feel everything she does with you is forceful and not very thoughtful. You are very right to be angry with her. \n-your father, for not understanding your point of view and enforcing it on his wife. He should be a mediator, try as a father to understand you. and he is not. \n-you (sorry), she can\u2019t be that evil person if your siblings love her and see her as a mother. She is wrong in forcing it on YOU, but you are wrong in this useless animosity and damaging your siblings relationship with her. Going around declaring how much you hate her, sure it\u2019s not good for the family overall dynamic. In a family there are many feelings, many people all are important. So your siblings too. \n-grandparents. Who in their right mind will take a minor out of their house in the middle of the night without notifying their parents/guardian. I can\u2019t imagine wake up and find a kid missing. They should be the adult and help you validate your point not enabling your teenage escape. You weren\u2019t in physical danger. Idiots.

It does. I hate the way she intruded on me just because my siblings wanted her to be their second mom. I should be allowed to be different but apparently not.", "Honestly the thing is, if it\u2019s affecting his mental health (which it seems like it is), his siblings feeling are out of question. He\u2019s almost 18, he needs to figure out how to get away from the parents honestly and maybe go low contact afterwards for a bit. He should not be guilted into staying or doing anything just for the sake of his siblings", "What do you mean by will they be hurt by this? Like will they be sad I'm not there or will they feel like I rejected them?", "My grandparents wanted to ensure I was safe. My guess is they knew I would leave regardless and wanted me safe. Plus they know how much I hate spending today with this woman because she's not my mom.", "All of OP's actions are reactions. She doesn't want a second mother and her stepmother should respect that. She looks at her as the new spouse of her father and I have the impression she could have a civil relationship with her if the stepmother wasn't forcing her to look at her like her mother. OP has every right to not want another mother.\nWas she acting childish? Yes. It is right that if she wasn't seeking out of the house she would have been forced to spend mother's day with a woman who literally changed her photos with her deceased mom to ones she is on? Absolutely not. It was nothing else but a consequence of stepmother's actions.", "You're 17 at this point you can decide who you want to live with.\n\nNta imo", "The semantics are irrelevant.

That's some evil stepmother vibes right there.", "I\u2019m not trying to guilt him, he seems to genuinely love them, and care about them.

Sorry but your grandparents are not doing a favor to you or your family. They should ah e welcome you of course but notify your family!", "Did I say her step mother shouldn\u2019t respect OP wishes? No. My first AH is the stepmother to be so forceful and tone deft on OP feelings.\nI\u2019m just stating for the well-being of her siblings and OP herself, a more soft approach should be taken. That\u2019s it. Also disappearing act in the middle of the night very childish. But I put the blame there on the grandparents. Why to go to make a bigger mess of all.

Please go ahead with the hate.", "Didn\u2019t destroy it. Altered it yes, but OP tore those pages out and burned them.

You must be a fantastic brother.", "We've talked it out. I never wanted there to be tension between us and worked hard to make sure they know I love them even if I don't feel the same as them about their parents.", "They\u2019re very lucky siblings.
