For me she is dad's wife though it bothers her and my dad more when I call her stepmother because it sounds very formal and cold to them. My mom wrote all of us kids books of letters before she died which covered every major milestone and just general letters for us to read whenever. My siblings wanted her to add letters to theirs. She decided she would take mine as well and add to it even when I said no. I tore them out and she stuck them back in and added more. She cried and said it hurt her that I tore out her meaningful words. Another time she changed a few of the photos in my room to ones after she married my dad.

So I arranged with my grandparents (maternal) to have them pick me up after everyone went to bed and I stayed at their house. My dad and his wife woke up about an hour ago and realized what I had done. They have been blowing up my phone ever since. She left a voice message crying that I broke her heart and why do I hate her so much and want to ruin her Mother's Day.

I should be allowed to be different but apparently not.", "Honestly the thing is, if it\u2019s affecting his mental health (which it seems like it is), his siblings feeling are out of question. He\u2019s almost 18, he needs to figure out how to get away from the parents honestly and maybe go low contact afterwards for a bit. He should not be guilted into staying or doing anything just for the sake of his siblings", "What do you mean by will they be hurt by this? Like will they be sad I'm not there or will they feel like I rejected them?", "My grandparents wanted to ensure I was safe. My guess is they knew I would leave regardless and wanted me safe. Plus they know how much I hate spending today with this woman because she's not my mom.", "All of OP's actions are reactions. She doesn't want a second mother and her stepmother should respect that. She looks at her as the new spouse of her father and I have the impression she could have a civil relationship with her if the stepmother wasn't forcing her to look at her like her mother. OP has every right to not want another mother.\nWas she acting childish? Yes. It is right that if she wasn't seeking out of the house she would have been forced to spend mother's day with a woman who literally changed her photos with her deceased mom to ones she is on? Absolutely not. It was nothing else but a consequence of stepmother's actions.", "You're 17 at this point you can decide who you want to live with.\n\nNta imo", "The semantics are irrelevant.  The DEAD mother left her child something, and against that Child's wishes, the interloper destroyed it, altered it, changed it.", "What she did with that book from your mother would have been deal-breaker for me. That's some evil stepmother vibes right there.", "I\u2019m not trying to guilt him, he seems to genuinely love them, and care about them.

Sorry but your grandparents are not doing a favor to you or your family. They should ah e welcome you of course but notify your family!", "Did I say her step mother shouldn\u2019t respect OP wishes? No. My first AH is the stepmother to be so forceful and tone deft on OP feelings.\nI\u2019m just stating for the well-being of her siblings and OP herself, a more soft approach should be taken. That\u2019s it. Also disappearing act in the middle of the night very childish. But I put the blame there on the grandparents. Why to go to make a bigger mess of all. But please if you think disappearing in the middle of the night be totally closed off to someone to the point to hating them will bring ANY, ANY form of improvement in the situation. Please go ahead with the hate.", "Didn\u2019t destroy it. Altered it yes, but OP tore those pages out and burned them. It could taint the sanctity of the book, if such a concept exists in OP\u2019s mind (I don\u2019t think it would for me but everyone\u2019s different), but it\u2019s not permanently ruined in the physical sense.", "Removing the pictures in his room was also up there in the evil", "Oh, they know I'm not rejecting them.

Before you know it, you\u2019ll be 18, hopefully in college, and living your own dream. You\u2019ve got this. Keep up the good feelings, I know it\u2019s hard.", "NTA. I see so much of this here on Reddit. Parents get widowed or divorced and remarry. All good and fine. But then there are the existing children. Wise parents understand that  children are people and as such are going to develop affections and feels for others on there own accord and in their own way. It can't be forced.\n\nUnfortunately some parents, like your dad and stepmom, do understand that. They have a cartoon vision of some Halmark perfect blended family and demand that the kids twist and mold themselves to fit that vision. Unfortunately life does work like that and everybody (including themselves) suffers from there demands. \n\nI'm sorry the situation has gotten so crazy for you. You are not a bad person for how you feel or refusing to pretend that you feel something you don't.  Good luck.", "I can't belive to added things to a booklet your mom made for you and took pictures put of your room with you and your mom. Besides these reasons is their any other reasons you don't see her has your mom? Don't get me wrong I know she can never replace your real mom but does she try to act like your mom or why is it that you hold a grudge to her?", "NTA OP.  If your dad tries to fight you moving in with your grandparents, then get a lawyer and fight him.", "NTA.  I hope you got your photos back.", "Nta - she is trying to force a relationship bond that just isn\u2019t there for you.", "NTA. OP, I am very sorry about this. Your stepmother and father obviously do not understand that you cannot force or impose a relationship. At 17, you are old enough to be on your own, and you're almost an adult. Please stay with your grandparents and make arrangements to live with them until you graduate from high school. If he tries to fight this in court, please get a lawyer and tell the judge that you made your decision. Good luck OP.", "NTA\nIt sounds as if your dad and stepmom tried to erase your mom by positioning stepmom as her replacement, rather than a new unique adult caretaker entering your life. If they had allowed you to hold onto your memories and relationship with your mom without creating a rivalry between mom1 and mom2, where the position and privileges had to be identical, and only occupied by a single person, a real intimate loving relationship could have grown.\n\nInstead, your experience has been your stepmom's intruding, stealing your precious mementos and literally inserting herself in your mom's place. Rather than the acceptance and support you need(ed) and deserve(d), your grief and love for your mom has been devalued and attacked. That's why you have these valid feelings that your stepmom has never been a mother to you. What you thought, felt and needed weren't heard, validated or supported. Her image of what you should be is what she loved and supported, up to and including attacking what you actually are that deviates from her imaginary you. Real you is a barrier to her imaginary you. Her response is to keep on chipping away at you to try to mold you into her version.", "NTA and if possible please stay at your grandparents house for good.", "The problem is she is trying to replace your mother by taking your photos and interfering with your mother's book and boundary stomping. \n\nHad she tried to work on a meaningful friendship she ay have had a chance. But her behaviour is awful. And so is your father's. NTA", "NTA. You owe your evil stepmother only revenge.", "NTA.\n\nAsk your maternal grandparents to do you a favor. Take your mom's memory book, and the pictures of you with your mom, to them to protect for you. Those items are your property even though you are a minor. At least if your grandparents have them, they will be safe, no matter where you are forced to live. (If your father says it is theft, point out that the book was vandalized, and some pictures disappeared. Both of which will look bad to a judge.)", "So what if she\u2019s not objectively evil? OP can still not like her. And the way she tried to remove traces of OP\u2019s deceased mother is disgusting. She\u2019s definitely evil in my book. And I don\u2019t feel the need to do things politely when they stomp over OP\u2019s boundaries repeatedly", "Depends on where OP lives and how anal retentive the authorities is. He should absolutely loom into it but unilaterally saying that he can shows an enormous ignorance of reality. Also, more countries than the US exists, but US Americans are unable to grasp that fact much to the detriment of the rest of us.", "You are doing a better job than your father and his wife."]}
