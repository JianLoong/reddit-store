Melody (18) my stepdaughter, and Mona and Leo (11) my biological twins. I meet my husband when I was 21 and at the lowest point of my life. I was just out of rehab didn't know what I wanted from life next. I came from a ab*sive household, both of my parents were alc*holic and used to beat up my older brother Chris whenever they felt like it, once Chris was off to college they started to use me like their punching bag. I was only 15. This went on for years which lead into very dark habits, dropped out of school at 17, smoked and sold pot whole day, parents and brother had no idea. When I was 19 Chris came to visit me and saw the state I was in he immediately put me in a rehab, I was in and out for about 2 years it's not that easy to quit.\n     \n21, fresh out of rehab, without any education and living with my bro somehow I found a waitressing job in a dinner. That's where I met Nathan and Melody for the first time she was 3. Trust me when I say this he's changed my life for so much better. He helped me get out of old habits, became my safe place and helped me discover my love for photography. We fell in love got married built a family and I couldn't be any happier.\n         \nI love and care for Melody like she's my own never considered her as stepdaughter, she also calls me mom. Her bio mom was never around but had me instead, she's even closer to me than her father. Tells me everything we have no secret.  Recently I found out that she's been dating a guy named Tim who's much older than her almost 24. Gross. I confronted her and she admitted to it. She said that she was going to tell me but I won't accept it because of the age gap and tell dad everything. Damn right I'll anyone in there right mind would. I tried to explain her how wrong this is and I won't tell dad if she stops seeing him. She agreed.             \n        \nA few days pass, I was walking my baby Bruno (our dog) a few blocks away when I saw Melody get out of the car with Tim, I felt betrayed and was angry but I calmed myself till she left. I had a real good conversation with Tim about their relationship and he should start seeing someone of his age instead. \n          \n Melody finds out, took it really bad and started arguing with me. I told her I was just looking out for her as a mother and she replied \"you're not even my real mom and atleast I'm not going around getting stoned dropping out of school \" ouch that hurt like nothing before. I had told her all of that because I trusted her and never thought she would use that against me like this but what hurt more was not being a real mother, yes I might have not given birth to her but never treated her anything less than a mother, was there for everything. That's when I replied with \"really you wouldn't know what a mother is if it weren't for me, your's didn't want you\" immediately regretted it later. She ran to her room crying and we haven't talked since.", "created_utc": 1670918752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkqbmn/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_that_she_wouldnt/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It probably really hurts that her biomom never cared. Teenagers are always mean a holes when they're upset because they havent figured out how to manage strong emotions calmly yet. You don't sink to their level.", "YTA very unusual you go to talk to the boyfriend 1st rather then her father. Regardless of whatever she said that comment to her was way more vicious and gross then what she said to you.", "YTA\n\nShe is an angry teenager despite her calling you names it is an *expected attitude* from an angry teenager. *Yours is the same*. \n\nBut you are a parent not an angry teenager yourself. You can't put yourself on her same level: your goal should be educate her and make her feel protected not making her feel like shit to assert your dominance.\n\nP.s. *And this just my personal opinion*. 24 is a lot older than a 18 but not that much to be worried about **if she is educate towards safe sex and focused on college/other forms of education/starting a career**", "You write so cold, I\u2019m freezing.\n\nHow could you say that?\nAnd how can you claim you see her as your own while instinctively you say this in rage?\n\nI might be wrong, maybe I am, but to me rage often shows more truth to what someone really thinks.\n\nYou both overstepped being angry and feeling betrayed.\n\nBut also keep in mind, she is an adult. Your control over her partners should be long past.\nAnd 18-24 isn\u2019t even a large gap.\nMore important should be if he treats her right, both are in love and good for eachother.\n\nTo me it doesn\u2019t seem like you even looked into Tim, how he is, who he is, and just coz of a number you rejected him.\nNot cool.", "YTA, but I think you already know that because you regretted it, but you haven\u2019t apologised which you really need to do.\n\nAs for the guy she\u2019s dating, you handled that pretty badly as well. Is it ideal for a 24 year old to date an 18 year old? IMO, no, but you definitely won\u2019t convince her to not date him by trying to convince him to date someone else. All that will result in is her resenting you and probably sticking with him longer than she would have if she wasn\u2019t trying to prove you wrong.", "YTA. Melody is legally an adult and you need to start treating her as one. It's one thing for you to voice your concerns but it is no longer your place to tell her to break up with anyone, or to go behind her back and convince her boyfriend to break up with her.\n\nYou crossed a line and throwing the fact that her mother didn't want her in her face makes this even worse. You were not acting like her mother when you said these things. This is a really great way to have Melody go no contact with you.", "YTA And \"congrats\" on keeping the cycle of abuse alive. You didn't physically hurt her, but that was an emotional beating you delivered. And all because you flubbed relationship advice so badly.", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t very \u201cmotherly\u201d of you.", "YTA!\n\nMelody got upset because you're trying to control and threaten your own stepdaughter with blackmail. Who wouldn't be upset? But one issue had nothing to do with the other. You need to apologize and make it right, because of what YOU said. Two wrongs don't make a right. She's still young and although 18 is an adult, she's still forming ways of trying to cope with life. Come on now. You all need to get it together. \n\nYou really think being told you got stoned and dropped out of school was so horrible, that it should have resulted in you telling her, that her own biological mother didn't want her? Really?", "YTA, she\u2019s 18, and unless you know that they met before she turned 18/started dating before that, her dating a 24 year old is not the most red flaggy age gap possible. Instead of being there for her, expressing your concern and acting like someone she can trust, you lecture her, go out of your way to destroy her relationship and tittle tattle to her dad. \n\nCus what\u2019s gonna happen if she still goes out with this dude and gets pregnant? What happens if he isn\u2019t good to her and abuses her? She ain\u2019t gonna come to you because now she won\u2019t trust you with her relationships. You might be a mother figure but you sure as hell didn\u2019t act like a good one there", "YTA. \nIf that\u2019s what you say to a kid you think of as your child I\u2019m scared of what you would say to your actual kid.\nApologize to her and tell her dad. Let him handle it. \nAlso when you tell a child secrets (given that she\u2019s only 19 I\u2019m sure you told her a while ago) you can\u2019t expect discretion. She\u2019s not you peer for you to snap back like that.", "YTA. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why but the most egregious thing that you did was throwing in her face that her mom didn\u2019t want her. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to come back from that. She might forgive you at some point but that\u2019ll always be in the back of her mind. Did you not think that her bio mom not being around isn\u2019t already a hole in her heart? Then you go throw it in her face. You can be the best step/foster parent to a kid and they are always gonna yearn for their bio parents love and affection.\n\nYou took what she said too personal because you think you\u2019re friends with her instead of her parent. It was mean and I don\u2019t doubt that it hurt your feelings but she\u2019s a teen that\u2019s what they do. She probably felt bad after she said it.", "\"I MIGHT be the asshole cause my words hurt her\" no, you ARE the biggest A for saying that and then even doubting if you are the one in the wrong. YTA YTA YTA", "YTA and boy did you overstep. If you think she's dating someone too old for her, talk to her father about it, NOT the boyfriend! And in any case why are you so sure an age gap is \"so wrong\" - isn't your husband older than you? \n\nBut Y W B T A no matter what for your purposely hurtful comments to your stepdaughter. You're the adult and should be able to handle her telling the truth about you dropping out of school and using drugs without lashing out with lies designed to cut down your stepdaughter. Shame.", "YTA Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you??? She said something shitty, so you felt the only recourse was to say something even worse.", "YTA. What an incredibly hurtful thing to say to your daughter. That's just an awful thing to throw in her face, and I wouldn't be surprised if your relationship doesn't recover. Also, she's an adult. As long as Tim treats her well, stay out of her love life. A six-year age gap isn't \"gross\". It's not likely to be the best at 18 and 24, but my dad was 17 when he met my 22-year-old mom and they've been married for almost 45 years.\n\nIf you have good reason to he worried about Tim (other than \"ewww, he's OLD!\") that's when you have a CONVERSATION with HER. It's not when you issue ultimatums and try to run him off. And if you really can't get past the age gap, again, CONVERSATION about why it can make for a difficult relationship.\n\nBasically you took all the wrong turns every step of the way.", "YTA. And in so many ways I can't even begin to tell you. But lets start with this: What on earth makes you think, you out of all persons have a right to tell a 18 year old how to live her life? You can tell her, you don't like that her bf is six years older and that's it. Legally she is an adult.  You have no business meddling in her relationship. Don't expect her to call that often once she moves out.", "YTA.  So much. \n\nFirst you have to know that if you come at a teenager with \u201cYOURE WRONG AND IM RIGHT. DO AS I SAY\u201d she\u2019s going to be compelled to do the [exact opposite](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-dont-follow-directions-2013-8?amp)\n\nSecond, you don\u2019t give much reason as to why the age gap is \u201cgross\u201d. When it comes to children, I\u2019ve found with my own that simply saying \u201cno\u201d just doesn\u2019t make sense to them. When I explain my thought process \u201cthis activity worries me for the following reasons\u201d they respond much better and can understand why I\u2019m worried about xyz. They may still make a bad decision, but that\u2019s how they learn. \n\nThird, you *secretly* talk to her BOYFRIEND?! about the relationship between him and your daughter? Like\u2014-omg the boundaries you just stomped over is nauseating. You want her to act like an adult but you treat her like a child and then are *pikachu shocked face* that she lashed out. \n\nFourth, ok she said something hurtful. That sucks. I know it feels awful when kids lash out. But instead of acting like the parent you claim to be and either walking away before you say something nasty or calmly replying, you say something hurtful back, right after trashing boundaries. That is grossly immature for someone your age. You should know better. As my mother always said \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d. \n\nFifth, in one fell swoop you may have ruined an entire relationship unnecessarily. She *had* been in a place where \u201cshe can tell you anything\u201d but now when it matters, she gets nothing but venom from you. This could have been a nice moment where you sit down with her and say \u201clisten, you\u2019re going to do what you want but I need to tell you why, as an adult with 18 more years of life experiences than you, why this bothers me. I just want to make sure you\u2019re safe and happy\u201d. But no. You go in like Godzilla and obliterate everything and say the most hurtful thing you can possibly think of bc she hurt you. \n\nIt is very typical for an 18 year old, who is technically an adult in the eyes of the law, to want to have the freedom that adults have. They don\u2019t have the life experience to totally understand consequences of their actions, which is why teens make really poor decisions. I know I did. I *know* you did. \n\nBUT instead of having grace, using your life experience to help your \u201cdaughter\u201d, try to give her your viewpoints, you just berate her and infantilize her. \n\nIt\u2019s not up to you to \u201caccept\u201d something. She has to learn on her own what is a good idea and a bad idea. You don\u2019t get to demand she follow your concepts of it. \n\nNah. You don\u2019t get a pass bc a teenager said something crappy. You\u2019re incredibly toxic in the post.", "Part of being a parent is always being the adult.\n\nYou were hurt, so you lashed out and said something deliberately hurtful.\n\nWhether you birthed this person or not, if you want to be considered their mother, you cannot do that.   You *have* to be the grown up.", "Hi \n\nI personally have a parents who never wanted me. I know it and now the parent isn't around and i didn't see him since i was 5. My other parent never had an other partner tho. Anyway i can't tell you how much i hurt especially when i was a teenager (even now than I'm 21). When i feel bad i USE this information as \"They never wanted you, why do you even exist if your own parent don't love you?\" to hurt myself.\nNobody never explicitly told me that, but my own thoughts wounded me so deeply. I can't imagine how Melody must feel, she will never forget what you told her you know ? And worst it will affect her brain and how she sees her own existence. \nOne of my parent told me once they wanted to abort me, i was 16 and they didn't even tell me to be mean, but i felt heartbroken. How could you do this to her ? \n\nyta", "YTA. How can you ask?! You have to know how unbelievably low that comment was.\n\nYou overstepped - she is 18 and you went behind her back to talk to her boyfriend. She was angry - fair - and you then said probably the nastiest thing you could. Easy YTA.", "YTA Bigtime. That last comment would be the end of the relationship for me if I was in your SD shoes. You think a whole lot of your self throwing that in her face like that, absolutely disgusting.", "Op, YTA but I get it and unfortunately you may have damaged your relationship with your SD. What she said was wrong but you're the adult here. You need to apologize to her and you may have just pushed her to that guy permanently. She won't speak, write her a honest letter with a sincere apology. Good luck.", "YTA, first, that\u2019s not much of an age gap, 6 years. They are both young adults and very similar in maturity. So YTA, for that, then YTA for intervening yourself, then YTA for throwing that in her face. She was angry at you because you got involved in something you shouldn\u2019t have.", "Wow YTA!!!!\n\n\nDid you forget that this is a child (18 sure, but still a child really) and you're the parent??\n\n\nIt's like you're a child, groping for the most hurtful insult in the throes of an argument. \n\n\nApologise IMMEDIATELY. Also, although your daughter is dating an older guy, forbidding it will only make her more determined to carry on in secret. Its basic psychology. Back off and make sure she's informed about the importance of bodily autonomy, consent and self respect. Let her know you're there if she needs you. Then trust her.", "INFO: Before I absolutely hound you on why YTA I would like to know a key detail you seem to have missed out. How old are you and Nathan?", "YTA. She's being really dumb, but she's also an adult. You've given your concern. Now it's time to step back. You can't force her to break up with him and keeping it from her father is also wrong.

Yes your daughter was wrong for throwing your past in your face and lying to you. However,you are suppose to lead by example and not stoop to the level of throwing her trauma back at her.

It makes me think you've been having those thoughts for awhile.", "Well as much as I agree with you about the age gap, and kudos for talking to that young man and hopefully he listened, your daughter is now 18.

And you may not want that for Melody, but you threatened her and threw at her likely the most horrible thing that's ever happened to her.\n\nShe's an ADULT and can date whomever she chooses. If you two were as close as you say (and you've ruined that forever by the way), then she's likely a good person. And you also didn't say a word about Tim, except that he's 23. YOU think it's gross? He's not 25 years older!  And maybe he's a nice guy! You know why you didn't say anything? Because you don't know. You're throwing out judgments based on nothing. \n\nYou owe her an apology, but don't expect to be forgiven.", "YTA. She's grown.  The smart thing would've been to insist on meeting this guy so he knows she has a family that cares and keep the lines of communication open. Instead you implied that her self worth was nothing because her own mother didn't want her.  She was hurtful and mean and frankly too old to say stuff like that,  but you made this infinitely worse.  Time to apologize and salvage your relationship because if you don't when this relationship implodes she will need her parents,  wish is both of you.", "YTA for what you said, of course you\u2019re her parent and it\u2019s up to you to be the more responsible party as she goes through her teenage moments.

It's obvious from this alone that you don't trust her, because if you did, you'd back off and make her own decisions.  \nYou both said some harsh, unnecessary truths. Teenagers are impetuous.

Yes, it was shitty of her to say what she said, but you\u2019re the parent. And what you said was infinitely shittier. If you had just said the first part, it would\u2019ve been a NAH situation. But when you said her mom didn\u2019t want her, you crossed a fucking line. I hope you\u2019re satisfied that you got the last word, because you probably just destroyed your relationship with her. She would be totally justified in never speaking to you again tbh. \n\nIs it smart for her to date a guy who is six years older when she is only 18? Probably not. But she is 18, and it is her mistake to make. Yes, you should talk to her about it and explain why you think it is a bad idea, but holding telling her dad over her head to try to force her to make the decision you want is an asshole move. Tbh you should just tell her dad and tell her that you don\u2019t keep secrets from your husband. I mean unless you\u2019re trying to wreck your marriage as well. \n\nYou need to own up to these mistakes. First, apologize to your stepdaughter and tell her that you never should have said that and you never should have said you wouldn\u2019t tell her dad about the boyfriend bc marriage is largely about honesty and trust, and you can\u2019t compromise your marriage, because her dad is your partner.\n\nThen you need to apologize to your husband for not telling him immediately. This is his daughter who lives in his house, and he has a right to know what you know. \n\nIt is also really concerning that you basically spied on your daughter and waited for her to leave and then accosted her boyfriend. That was crossing a line, and it wasn\u2019t really your place to do that. If she was under age, okay. But she isn\u2019t. She is 18. If you have something to say to him, you should do it with her present. \n\nIt seems like you are a kind of manipulative person, and when you discovered your manipulation was not going to work, you got crazy toxic and said something absolutely horrible to someone you claim to love. You think she doesn\u2019t KNOW her mother didn\u2019t want her? You don\u2019t think she already struggles with that? You basically took the thing she is probably most insecure about and threw it in her face. You\u2019re THIRTY-SiX years old; learn to deal with conflict like a grown up. Stop sneaking around collecting secrets. It is not healthy. You and your spouse and your. Daughter need to sit down and set expectations about the boyfriend. You can\u2019t actually stop her from dating him. I guess you could kick her out, but that won\u2019t prevent her from dating him, since she is an adult. If you kick her out, she will probably move in with him. So you can tell her, hey, we don\u2019t like this, but we respect that it is your decision. Here are the rules if you want to date him while you live here\u2026 and then lay out whatever rules, whether that is no sex in your house or some kind of curfew or what\u2026 it is weird to have a curfew for an adult, but since she lives there, I guess it is whatever. \nI think your best bet is to be light on rules and let the relationship fizzle out or blow up. It isn\u2019t ideal, but she is an adult. We all have relationships we regret. \n\nYou\u2019re being awfully judgmental for someone who was a drug addict dropout when you were her age. It sounds like she is a good kid, and she is just dating someone you would rather she didn\u2019t. If that is the worst thing she does, do you really feel like you have the right to get judge-y about it?", "YTA.  That was an extraordinarily cruel thing to say.  Yeah, she was shitty to you, but she's a teenager, and you're a grown woman in your mid thirties.", "She is 18 and her boyfriend is 24 it\u2019s an age gap but hardly the worst one ever", "ESH. SHE was pissed and you were wounded. Its a good chance to be the adult, approach and apologise and explain that you said mean shit to hurt her cos she had hurt you badly.  Its worth her learning that a) parents fuck up too and b) dont dish it if you cant deal with getting it back- a handy life lesson at her age. \nYeah she said you arent her bio mum etc\u2026..but im telling you even if you WERE then she would have said \u201ci didnt ask to be born\u201d or some shit.
