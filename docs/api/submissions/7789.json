I get your desire to protect him. It sounds like she's not the most emotionally intelligent human you know.  You're also probably feeling protective of your expected baby and may want her entirely out of your life.  Only you know whether this transgression was bad enough to merit your actions.  It sounds way too nuanced to be decided by random internet strangers.  Best of luck in sorting this out in a way that is emotionally healthy for you and your loved ones.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good soul for raising and for sticking up for Mason.  Congratulations and all the best to you and your family. BTW\u2026You\u2019re sending mom $$ regularly?

I suspect that she said something VERY belittling to him. As someone who is probably closer to your mum's age than yours, who has worked with kids for many years, and based on your brother's reactions, I would guess that she told him (at BEST) that he was being ridiculous for thinking that your choice of name had anything to do with him, or ridiculous for thinking that you'd choose a name based on his suggestion, because he was just a kid. And that's the best-case scenario. Given his upset, and his telling you that you, \"Didn't have to use the name,\" it's entirely possible that she scolded him for getting involved in something that was \"grown-up business\". No matter what, she made him feel embarrassed and ashamed, which you clearly already know.\n\nI know you've already reassured him, but given that he has been embarrassed and is trying to play it off, I would sit him down and tell him FIRMLY and UNEQUIVOCALLY, even if it embarrasses him a little more (because it's the good kind of embarrassment) that you and your husband are really glad he gave you the idea, and really proud that he's going to be your little girl's uncle, because he clearly already cares about her to come up with such a great name.

I hope you can sit down & talk to him\u2014not necessarily get him to tell you what she said, but reassure him how much you love him & how much you like the name he chose.
