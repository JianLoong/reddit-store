I contacted my son's dad to ask him if he would have our son (7) for the week (even though he mostly has custody on weekends only). I let him know it was okay if he was unable to, as my mom had already offered to watch him. He said he couldn't because of his work schedule but said he would take Friday (the 4th day of my trip) of work and pick our son up from my mom\u2019s Thursday night and keep him until Sunday.\n\nThe day before my vacation my mom called to say that she was sick, nothing serious but probably contagious and asked if I could make other plans for my son. When she called, I was with my boyfriend, who offered to look after my son in place of my mom.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a very casual relationship that is arguably closer to a friends with benefit situation. We've been involved for a couple years now but have been friends for 15+ years. My son has known this man all his life, has no idea we are in any kind of relationship, and sees him as an uncle figure. He has several of his own kids, including a 8 y/o son that my son is good friends with. He switched around the custody so he could have his son the same week my son would be there. So they kind of had a long sleepover with school in-between lol.\n\nMy boyfriend also has an adult daughter that lives with him that was able to help him watch the kids when he was working.\n\nI decided not to tell my ex about leaving our son with him because I knew he wouldn't like it as he has a negative history with the man I'm dating. They go way back and haven't liked each for probably a decade. I didn't want to go into the effort of finding another babysitter when a perfectly fine one had already offered. I decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nOn Thursday morning I told my ex to pick our son up from my bf's and texted him the address. He was beyond pissed and was texting and calling me for hours. He tried to act like I left our son in an unsafe environment and said if I had told him my mom had cancelled that he could have figured something. Even my mom is on his side and said I should have let him know beforehand and given him the ability to veto.\n\nHe had already said he couldn't because of work, and I just would have had to go into finding another sitter at short notice.\n\nEdit: we don't have a custody agreement.", "created_utc": 1676498027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1139n3y/aita_for_leaving_my_son_at_my_boyfriends_house/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also don't tend to apply to step parents, only unmarried partnerships. They are largely punishing to the primary caregiver, which tends to be women.

My husband's agreement with his ex includes it, but mine does not. And in this case, the dad did get the first choice and he refused. First. *That's what the term means.* Prior approval of babysitters is something you can have written intp a parenting agreement, but again, they don't have one, and it's not an inherent expectation. \n\nI will say it's bad form to not tell him until pickup.

You can't just walk into the police station and say \"my kid's missing\". When they ask the last time you saw the kid, you say 10 days ago when he left with mom. Then they would ask if mom knows where the kid is. Amber alerts aren't issued Willy nilly. They didn't refuse to turn the kid over to him when he was finally available to care for the kid. There was no kidnapping. Dad doesn't have the kid very often. He doesn't get to decide if mom can go on vacation or leave kid with alternative care for whatever reason. \n\nYes, mom screwed up not telling him before hand. Mom should always inform dad that she's leaving kid with X caregiver if he's going to be there an extended period of time. Dad does not get to tell mom no without a truly valid reason.

Mom doesn't get to do anything pretty much ever without thinking about her child. Yes, he has every \"right\" to the child as the mom, but he doesn't exercise it. He's not there every day, handling school and activities and doctors visits and every other thing. He doesn't have to think of his kid 85% of the time when he's making plans.

Kids are way less work with a friend to keep them busy. Ex doesn't have the right to veto a kid having a sleepover with his best bud.", "He didn't make arrangements though.

Then it's on ex if the kid stays with mom's boyfriend or not and he doesn't get to be upset with mom following through with plans she's already had in place for a while. \n\nI said it elsewhere, but dad is literally able to plan a 4 day vacation every single week of the year without giving one iota of thought to the care of his child. Mom doesn't get to do pretty much anything without taking the care of her child into consideration. Dad might get upset, but honestly can't see him actually following through with getting more parenting time considering he had plenty of advanced notice where he could have taken off work to care for his kid while OP was away but he \"couldn't because of work\". I'm assuming OP works and yet she's managing to figure out how to work and have the kid all the days during the week every single week. \n\nOPs ex apparently doesn't even contact the kid during the week when he's not with him or else he would have figured out the kid wasn't at grandma's.

Well taken care of kids get taken away unnecessarily (especially minority children) and kids who really need their help get buried in the mounds of cases they have. This can create a difficultly in court for the mother that\u2019s petty and unjust as well. Please save CPS for when it\u2019s truly warranted.

If he is that upset and thinks something so god awful happens he needs to call cps so they can substantiate the claims and he can go for full custody, and save his child from the apparently unsafe man.

Maybe that's why I triggered to the \"she should have canceled\" remark.\n\nI'm not from the USA, so don't know what is common over there. \n\nWith my own divorce 20 years ago, no agreement was made either ( besides child support), because ex simply stated that he didn't have the time to watch \"my kids\" and that he would pick them up for a visit \"when he felt like it\"", "We are talking about leaving your child with a man, a woman is in a casual, sexual relationship with.

You cannot just place your child anywhere. Because it suits your fun time. It\u2019s called respect. Yes you absolutely stay home if you can\u2019t find anyone but your causal sex friend to watch your child.", "Finally someone with common sense", "Something I would like to add is that in a lot of shared coparenting situations for custody exchange, a lot of coparents cannot dictate who picks up a child for custody exchange. If the adult is a trusted individual, you cannot prevent a trusted adult from picking up a child on their custody time simply because you do not like them. It applies for both residential parents and non-residential parents.  \n\nShe should have notified the father about the whereabouts of the child prior to the vacation. If a trusted adult does not have any prior convictions related to domestic violence, vehicular charges that result in suspension of license for trusted individuals being in the driving seat during custody exchange, a prior history of drug related offenses or any convictions (including probationary time) that prevent children from being in a \"trusted individual\" caregivers presence, you really cannot prevent supervision of a child on that caregiver's custody time. If this is the case, this is the only situation that judges will consider what is in the best interests of the child for custody. You cannot go to trial and prevent supervision of a child simply because you do not like that person. \n\nWhen parents are considering right of refusal clauses written into a parental agreement, you should really consider how damaging it could possibly be. Some clauses with right to first refusal can prevent spending time with extended family members such as grandparents with an overnight stay or with the parents of a childhood friend sleepover. \n\nSome people will exploit right to first refusal and it damages any  relationship that is healthy and beneficial. It goes for any shared coparenting relationship. If you are custodial parent and petty, it ruins any meaningful relationship with friends/family that a child can make simply because you want to exercise control over non-custodial parents and they can do this in return/vice versa.", "By that logic she could have literally given the kid to anyone", "I understand. Yes, you are correct. My bad.", "Yep, and not a single one has commented on the fact that the kid was with the moms boyfriend/ whatever for several days and dad never figured it out because he never made an attempt to contact his kid. A simple \"hi, how's grandma's?\" Would have clued him into the fact that the boy wasn't at grandma's. OP obviously wasn't concerned about that happening, so shows me how involved dad really is in the kid's life. The kid probably already spends more time with mom's boyfriend than his dad anyway.", "Good luck.

She and her ex have known the bf for a long time and it sounds like the exs issues have nothing to do with their ability to take care of a child and more just disliking the mums partner.. I'm sorry but when one parent is only showing up once every other week, then it isn't an equal coparenting situation and I don't think dad gets to make demands about OPs limited free time. He wasn't available, mum made other arrangements.. its not that difficult", "He's someone she has been seeing on and off for 15 years, who was a friend to both parents previously, he's got a son the same age and is clearly a part of their child's life regardless of the fact that he and the dad fell out 10 years ago.. how and when the mum had sex with her partner is irrelevant to his childrearing capabilities but go off I guess. \n\nI misread the every other weekend part you are correct, and I can't imagine ignoring my child for a week to not know where they are and how they are doing, so I can't really find much sympathy for dad in that regard.", "Lol okay firstly she didn't just place him anywhere, you not respecting the kind of relationship she has with this man (who she has know for 15!! Years), does not make him some stranger. Kid was safe and happy, dad didn't even bother to check in to find out.", "For real. This thread is absurd.", "Yes, she could\u2019ve.

We were in NC though", "I mean I'm sure others could come up with something more inflammatory.  Fuck buddy comes to mind and is reasonably accurate.", "I sympathize with a child being sent to a place that directly disrespects the father so mom could go on vacation.", "Just because a man is your ex doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t deserve respect. It\u2019s easy to bail on a vacation and not disrespect the father of your child when you don\u2019t feel like finding another sitter", "Where are you getting this idea that he has no custody?", "Honestly, if he's a 15 year long time friend who the kid considers an uncle, fwb_fuck buddy isn't really very accurate. From the kid's viewpoint, he got to spend the week with uncle Bob and one of his good friends.", "OP\u2019s edit saying there\u2019s no custody agreement. She therefor has full. He just hangs out with the kid over the weekend or when it\u2019s convenient for him.", "At the end of the day this wasn't the best thing for the kid.   She clearly knew this would antagonize her coparent relationship.  Not to mention we don't even know what the actual beef is with him.  She refuses to tell us.  Just her characterization that it was petty, and honestly I don't know that I believe that. I would say our narrator is biased.  \n\nEven her mom thinks this was a bad idea.   Her mom is going to know more of the relevant details here then we've gotten, and she's come down against this.", "Yeah, like where does this dude get off screaming about where his kid was? If he cares so much he should watch his kid. \n\nGotta love dads who show up one weekend a month but cry the whole time about child support and whatever decisions mom has made for the kids.", "Yep, she could have, probably would have been the right thing to do as I've said repeatedly. Still doesn't change the fact that if you're not the one parenting the kid, you're not the one in charge of decision making. You simply asked if you can just do whatever you want and the answer is pretty much yes as long as you're not harming the child.\n\nWould you feel any different about the situation of mom just said \"I'm planning girls trip these dates, can you take son?\" And he said \"can't, work\"? And then he didn't ask any follow up questions or make any effort to help her with childcare?", "You wish, not a weekend only dad"]}
