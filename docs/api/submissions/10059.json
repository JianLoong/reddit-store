I contacted my son's dad to ask him if he would have our son (7) for the week (even though he mostly has custody on weekends only). I let him know it was okay if he was unable to, as my mom had already offered to watch him. He said he couldn't because of his work schedule but said he would take Friday (the 4th day of my trip) of work and pick our son up from my mom\u2019s Thursday night and keep him until Sunday.\n\nThe day before my vacation my mom called to say that she was sick, nothing serious but probably contagious and asked if I could make other plans for my son. When she called, I was with my boyfriend, who offered to look after my son in place of my mom.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a very casual relationship that is arguably closer to a friends with benefit situation. We've been involved for a couple years now but have been friends for 15+ years. My son has known this man all his life, has no idea we are in any kind of relationship, and sees him as an uncle figure. He has several of his own kids, including a 8 y/o son that my son is good friends with. He switched around the custody so he could have his son the same week my son would be there. So they kind of had a long sleepover with school in-between lol.\n\nMy boyfriend also has an adult daughter that lives with him that was able to help him watch the kids when he was working.\n\nI decided not to tell my ex about leaving our son with him because I knew he wouldn't like it as he has a negative history with the man I'm dating. They go way back and haven't liked each for probably a decade. I didn't want to go into the effort of finding another babysitter when a perfectly fine one had already offered. I decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nOn Thursday morning I told my ex to pick our son up from my bf's and texted him the address. He was beyond pissed and was texting and calling me for hours. He tried to act like I left our son in an unsafe environment and said if I had told him my mom had cancelled that he could have figured something. Even my mom is on his side and said I should have let him know beforehand and given him the ability to veto.\n\nHe had already said he couldn't because of work, and I just would have had to go into finding another sitter at short notice.\n\nEdit: we don't have a custody agreement.", "created_utc": 1676498027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1139n3y/aita_for_leaving_my_son_at_my_boyfriends_house/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
