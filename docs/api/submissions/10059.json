I contacted my son's dad to ask him if he would have our son (7) for the week (even though he mostly has custody on weekends only). I let him know it was okay if he was unable to, as my mom had already offered to watch him. He said he couldn't because of his work schedule but said he would take Friday (the 4th day of my trip) of work and pick our son up from my mom\u2019s Thursday night and keep him until Sunday.\n\nThe day before my vacation my mom called to say that she was sick, nothing serious but probably contagious and asked if I could make other plans for my son. When she called, I was with my boyfriend, who offered to look after my son in place of my mom.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a very casual relationship that is arguably closer to a friends with benefit situation. We've been involved for a couple years now but have been friends for 15+ years. My son has known this man all his life, has no idea we are in any kind of relationship, and sees him as an uncle figure. He has several of his own kids, including a 8 y/o son that my son is good friends with. He switched around the custody so he could have his son the same week my son would be there. So they kind of had a long sleepover with school in-between lol.\n\nMy boyfriend also has an adult daughter that lives with him that was able to help him watch the kids when he was working.\n\nI decided not to tell my ex about leaving our son with him because I knew he wouldn't like it as he has a negative history with the man I'm dating. They go way back and haven't liked each for probably a decade. I didn't want to go into the effort of finding another babysitter when a perfectly fine one had already offered. I decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nOn Thursday morning I told my ex to pick our son up from my bf's and texted him the address. He was beyond pissed and was texting and calling me for hours. He tried to act like I left our son in an unsafe environment and said if I had told him my mom had cancelled that he could have figured something. Even my mom is on his side and said I should have let him know beforehand and given him the ability to veto.\n\nHe had already said he couldn't because of work, and I just would have had to go into finding another sitter at short notice.\n\nEdit: we don't have a custody agreement.", "created_utc": 1676498027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1139n3y/aita_for_leaving_my_son_at_my_boyfriends_house/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex\u2019s beef with him is probably petty jealousy and completely unrelated to his parenting abilities, which make them irrelevant.", "YTA - Are you serious OP?", "YTA, your BF does not have any rights or authority over your son, you leave your son with his father.\n\n>I decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nAlways make you an AH regardless of any reasoning.\n\n>He had already said he couldn't because of work, and I just would have had to go into finding another sitter at short notice.\n\nThen you do that, or you don't go on your trip, you are a parent your personal life comes second to your child and your BF is not a valid caretaker without your son's father approval.", "YTA - How would you feel if the situation was reversed and your ex left your son with his GF who you don\u2019t like?  \n\nWhile it sounds like your BF is is fine and a good option for watching your son, you still should have at least told your ex.", "YTA  \n\n\nThe other parent should have known. I wouldn't be surprised if he took you to court for official custody agreements after this stunt.", "You might not have a custody agreement now, but I have a feeling you will soon because YTA. You might want to look into a lawyer, because you\u2019re going to need one", " YTA how would you feel if he did this to you??? You really cared more about your trip then how your child\u2019s father would feel. You should have given him the chance to help figure out a solution. Please just realize when he starts cutting you out of decisions, you started this and made it okay.", "Someone please call 911. You don't deserve that LO. YTA", "Yeaaaa. You know, YTA. \n\nYou said Dad already said he had to work but we all know if our child we\u2019re gonna be left in a situation where they were with someone we don\u2019t trust or even like for that matter\u2014we make sacrifices. \n\nSo you should\u2019ve went back after mom was sick and said, hey new circumstances. I have Mr. XZY to sit bc moms sick, and then if he said well I don\u2019t like him you could said, my options are him or you\u2026and let him decide. \n\nI got to know, how would you feel, honestly if it was the other way around?", "NTA. Dad couldn\u2019t be bothered to watch him. Kid obviously survived. No harm, no foul.

Even tho u trust that person it\u2019s still not ok. Ur child\u2019s father is breathing and healthy and by the looks of it IT\u2019S HIS CHILD TOO. R u kidding me? U left ur child with ur boyfriend? For 5 days\u2026 ma\u2019am r u normal?", "YTA - lol cmon, you knew your ex would\u2019ve had an issue with it and you deliberately waited until things couldn\u2019t be changed to tell him. Super shady", "YTA it really seems you\u2019ve been cheating with the guy forever and now you just sleep together but are also best friends so I guess you\u2019re in a relationship and then just casually write \u201c**I decided not to tell my ex about leaving our son with him because I knew he wouldn\u2019t like it as he has a negative history with the man I\u2019m dating.**\u201d \n\nI just couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading", "NTA. You offered your ex a chance to take care of this and he declined. Then you found a safe, suitable situation.  Job done.", "YTA. Also depending on your custody agreement, you could be violating it. We had that happen and it was not good for the other mama lol. \n\nStop being selfish", "On one hand, you did give him the first right of refusal. But when your mom fell through you should have asked again. Because you went with the forgiveness instead of asking one more time, YTA.", "YTA. The issue here is you took the father out of the equation based on your own convenience, and then put him with a guy, who may be amazing, however, you even indicated your relationship is more akin to a FWB, to add insult to injury you chose someone the father did not care for. \n\nTBH, you fucked up and you need to make amends somehow. In the future don't just assume you can put your kid up with anyone without consulting the birth father. What if a medical emergency occurred and he couldn't reach either of you? \n\nWith love, do better.", "YTA.  So you leave him for 5 days with a non family member. Great plan. What if a medical emergency came up and the bf could not get ahold of you or the father to make medical decisions?  Did that cross your mind?", "YTA", "YTA and you knew you were being one when you made the decision knowing you would be asking for forgiveness instead of permission. You guys are suppose to be coparenting- you knew your ex wouldn\u2019t like it.  You could have easily said to your ex \u201c my mom is sick and can\u2019t. The only one who can watch son is my BF. Unless you can watch son than BF will be. You have until ____pm to let me know \u201c. That way ex was aware and had options and you didn\u2019t have to scramble for someone else. You did this because it was most convenient for you but at the expense of the trust and ease of your coparenting relationship with your ex. You the AH. How upset would you be if your ex left your son for a week with someone you didn\u2019t like or trust without notifying you or giving you the option.", "Now why would a parent have an issue with their kid not being where he was told they would be only to find out the kid has been left with a pseudo br that they already have an issue with. You knew full well that this would be an issue but you couldn't be bothered because you had plans with your friends and didn't want to be bothered figuring things out. YTA and you knew you would be", "I won't be surprised if he now takes her to court for more official custody agreement.", "OP says they don't have a legal custody agreement. I'm thinking after this, the ex is gonna get one made.", "Yep! Case closed, that one sentence is a whopper.", "No they don't.", "Unless it\u2019s a regular occurrence, it\u2019s fine.", "I'm just having trouble believing it was \"petty\". Nice vague by adding in the sister as part of it as \"something, whatever\"......I am very sure you know exactly why he felt it was unsafe, I mean, you were in a relationship with your ex when this \"petty\" thing happened. I'm sure he gave you earfulls why he doesn't like them.   \nBut your friend with benefits (your words) is more precious than your ex's concerns for your child.   \nYou lying to him was questionable decision making, you choosing the very people he hates and mistrusts for your and HIS son was again questionable. Do you see the pattern? A custody case against you is building easily.  \nHint from a mother: Main sitter can't? Don't pick the friend with benefits....STAY HOME, YOUR KID IS MORE IMPORTANT.", "Yeah that line is for buying a video game or eating the last piece of pizza\u2026 not child custody situations.", "Nah, a judge will literally say oh well, she can have whoever she wants watch him on her time. Right of first refusal for parents is something that has to be specifically written in an order, and they don't even have an order. It's all fair game as far as court is concerned.", "If it\u2019s during her time, and she asked him first, and assuming there is nothing prohibiting this in the custody agreement, how would she have fucked herself over?", "She told the dad her mom could watch their kid which was obviously acceptable to him.", "If you can't tell theres a difference between \"If not you, his grandmother\" and \"If not you, my fwb who you hate\" then I don't know what to say...", "He said no because there was already alternate childcare with her mom but when mom became sick he should\u2019ve been notified to at least see if something could be worked out", "Mother here.....sometimes cancelling plans happens when you have kids. The fact she couldn't handle that is questionable.", "Yeah, that's why I said she was TA.", "You might be missing my point. I said she was TA.", "Like OP is saying they don\u2019t have a custody arrangement. I would now! If I was dad. Your going to leave my kid with someone I\u2019ve hated for a decade because I was working, you wanted to go on a trip and your mom was sick? Yeah we\u2019re going to need some security around here", "Exactly this!", "She's the AH for not communicating the change in plans, he thought his son was with his grandmother for an extended period of time.  Once her mom said she couldn't watch him, she should have called him and told him that, and if he couldn't work something out the child would be with FWB, whether he liked it or not (as long as the kid was safe their petty fued is not relevant).  You  \"ask for forgiveness \"  when you know you were in the wrong.", "They've been friends 15+ years.....and she neglected to say when they began the \"with benefits\"......pretty sure she and her \"friend with benefits\" started up the benefits while she was married. Would make sense for all the bad blood. Really wrong of her to do this.", "According OP's comments, the FWB was originally Ex's friend first. And something happened between FWB and Ex's Sister that resulted in the friendship ending.\n\nSo likely FWB cheated or did something to Ex's Sister so extreme that Ex decided to end 2 decades worth of friendship with.", "She hasn't, there just seem to be a lot of either children, AWALT incels, or every other weekend daddy's who are butthurt that they don't get to control their ex any longer. At worst it would be a slap on the hand for not updating him of the kid's location, but I don't know if I've seen a custody agreement that says the parent gets right to first refusal and the custodial parent must update the non custodial parent of who is taking care of the kid if the non custodial declines right to first refusal. Mine's pretty boilerplate on that front and the only requirement to tell the other where the kid is is if you're traveling away from home with the kid, then you let the other parent know where you're going, where you're staying and contact info for the location.", "I don\u2019t think the length of time matters here. Either someone is safe to be around your kids, or they are not.", "But that's not how first refusal works - she asked he wasn't willing/able.  He gave up his first choice.  Then it was up to her to find someone.\n\nTo be clear I'm not disagreeing she's the AH for intentionally hiding the fact her kid stayed with someone he didn't like but he still had his chance and said no.  My comment is strictly on the fact he had a chance and said no.", "All these people saying Y T A have never tried to coparent with a controlling ex. \n\nThey don't have an agreement, which is stupid, but when it's her time she gets to make arrangements. When its his, he does the same. It's called parallel parenting, and it's not ideal but it's thee only way to deal with some exes. \n\nAlso, right of first refusal is not inherent. My husband's agreement with his ex includes it, but mine does not. And in this case, the dad did get the first choice and he refused. First. *That's what the term means.* Prior approval of babysitters is something you can have written intp a parenting agreement, but again, they don't have one, and it's not an inherent expectation. \n\nI will say it's bad form to not tell him until pickup. It would upset anyone to not know where their child is sleeping. She should have informed him of where the kid was staying and if he had a problem with that tell him to make time for his kid next time the opportunity presents itself.", "Her ex isn\u2019t dictating her life. He is ensuring the care, safety, and keeping of HIS CHILD. It doesn\u2019t matter how much time dad has his child, he is still just as much of a parent as OP is and has every right to know and approve who his child is staying with. OP does not hold sole decision making unless she has sole custody (which she does not). There doesn\u2019t have to be any reason other than dad said no. No is a complete sentence. He doesn\u2019t owe her any justification in his reasoning. \n\nOP could have gotten both herself and her \u201cboyfriend\u201d arrested with this stunt. Dad could have justifiably filed a missing child report and had a full amber alert out. OP was reckless, conniving, and selfish.", "You also \"ask for forgiveness\" because you don't want to be harassed by an unreasonable ex freaking out because they want to control how you live your life. I mean, obviously know one knows if that's the situation, but it absolutely could be.", "\"We've been involved for a couple of years now but friends for 15+ years\"", "That\u2019s definitely what happened.", "> My boyfriend and I have a very casual relationship that is arguably closer to a friends with benefit situation\n\nu/Fluffy-Scheme7704 isn't being inflammatory at all the the OP herself describes the BF as a very casual relationship, a FWB.  There's no reason to replace describing the BF as FWB with anything else", "But he is still the father. And have the right to know where his child is going to be even if its not his time with him.", "She asked with the caveat that if he couldn\u2019t her mom had volunteered. He said he couldn\u2019t because her mom was the alternate. He didn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t under any circumstances.", "> Why isn't it his responsibility to find alternative child care?\n\nIt could've been his responsibility, but when OP's original plan fell apart, she didn't give the father the opportunity to suggest or make alternative arrangements.\n\n> Why should a woman have to ask permission from her ex to go on vacation?\n\nThe OP doesn't have to ask permission from her ex to go on vacation.  BUT she should've **communicated** with her ex when her original caring plans needed to be changed.  This isn't about vacation approvals, this is about caring plans during her vacation.", "He has a right to know who his child is staying with. He has a right to make alternative arrangements if he doesn't approve of her choice. He absolutely does not have the right to tell her he's not taking care of the kid and that she's not allowed to use a close friend when there's no valid reason for the friend not to watch the kid. \n\nShe stated there's no custody agreement, why do you think he would be able to file a missing child report without them making an effort to contact the mother who he left the child in the care of? You can't just walk into the police station and say \"my kid's missing\". When they ask the last time you saw the kid, you say 10 days ago when he left with mom. Then they would ask if mom knows where the kid is. Amber alerts aren't issued Willy nilly. They didn't refuse to turn the kid over to him when he was finally available to care for the kid. There was no kidnapping. Dad doesn't have the kid very often. He doesn't get to decide if mom can go on vacation or leave kid with alternative care for whatever reason. \n\nYes, mom screwed up not telling him before hand. Mom should always inform dad that she's leaving kid with X caregiver if he's going to be there an extended period of time. Dad does not get to tell mom no without a truly valid reason. Dad is perfectly within his rights to take the kid himself or arrange alternate care. If he refuses to do that, he does not get to veto mom's choices. \n\nAnd no, the person who visits their kids every other weekend and lives the child free life the other 12 days is not just the same as the one who's there day in and day out. Dad could literally plan a 4 day vacation every single week of the year without having to put one single thought into the care of the child. Mom doesn't get to do anything pretty much ever without thinking about her child. Yes, he has every \"right\" to the child as the mom, but he doesn't exercise it. He's not there every day, handling school and activities and doctors visits and every other thing. He doesn't have to think of his kid 85% of the time when he's making plans. If he truly cared who his child was spending time with, he could be more involved in the kid's life. He already said he \"couldn't\" take off work while mom was traveling - that's how much he cared about his equal rights and access to the kid.", "The only reasonable answer I've seen here so far", "Nowhere in the the post or comments (unless I didn't see it) did she say he was controlling, she said they didn't like each other over some past  bs and he wouldn't be happy about it. You are just assuming this with not much evidence to back it up.  Maybe he is, I don't know, but she didn't say anything to really suggest that's the case. He had a right to know where and who his kid was with for 5 days, period (even if he wasn't happy about it).", "She also described the man as \"like an uncle\" to the boy and the father of the boy's good friend. Using fwb is the most inflammatory description and ignores the other descriptors because it just doesn't sound as crazy.", "Technically it would depend on the visitation/custody agreement.  Since they don't have one and it seems the kid stays the majority of the time with her he may not have that right.\n\nAgain i'm not disputing she's the AH for choosing this guy.  My point is simply he was given first choice and said no.  She has responsibility for the child so she had to find someone else.", "Completely agree.", "I mean that is why I said \"obviously no one knows if that's the situation, but it absolutely could be.\" No one ever knows the full story in these posts so I'm just trying to see it from a different perspective.", "Yeah, I really want to know if ex doesn\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a jealous idiot, or if there\u2019s a legitimate reason behind it. OP is being so vague that my BS antennae are quivering.", "So you think that if its not your time with the kid, the other parent can do whatever they want?", "I get that, and I don't think she was the ah for leaving him with someone she knows and trusts,  but she is for not communicating it to the other parent.", "Quivering madly!", "Yep, I have a gut feeling that this is very pertinent to the story", "Yeah, that's how most custody situations work. If they leave the kid in an unsafe environment you can report them, but what you do on your time, is frankly your business.", "That's kind of how it works, barring doing anything harmful to the child. Right to first refusal still applies, but other than that, each parent has the right to parent in the way they deem best. Preferably you're on the same page about things, but most parents aren't going to do things exactly the same. If there's something crazy happening, you could take them to court to change custody rules, but that's about it.", "I agree, but it's hard for me to judge. As a co-parent, sometimes you just want to do something, anything, without having to wade through a huge conflict, I get it.", "Mom could tell the dad that the grandmother couldn\u2019t watch the kid. Im sure the dad would have preferred taking care of his kid than what she did. Thats called co parent!"]}
