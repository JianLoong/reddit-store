I contacted my son's dad to ask him if he would have our son (7) for the week (even though he mostly has custody on weekends only). I let him know it was okay if he was unable to, as my mom had already offered to watch him. He said he couldn't because of his work schedule but said he would take Friday (the 4th day of my trip) of work and pick our son up from my mom\u2019s Thursday night and keep him until Sunday.\n\nThe day before my vacation my mom called to say that she was sick, nothing serious but probably contagious and asked if I could make other plans for my son. When she called, I was with my boyfriend, who offered to look after my son in place of my mom.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a very casual relationship that is arguably closer to a friends with benefit situation. We've been involved for a couple years now but have been friends for 15+ years. My son has known this man all his life, has no idea we are in any kind of relationship, and sees him as an uncle figure. He has several of his own kids, including a 8 y/o son that my son is good friends with. He switched around the custody so he could have his son the same week my son would be there. So they kind of had a long sleepover with school in-between lol.\n\nMy boyfriend also has an adult daughter that lives with him that was able to help him watch the kids when he was working.\n\nI decided not to tell my ex about leaving our son with him because I knew he wouldn't like it as he has a negative history with the man I'm dating. They go way back and haven't liked each for probably a decade. I didn't want to go into the effort of finding another babysitter when a perfectly fine one had already offered. I decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nOn Thursday morning I told my ex to pick our son up from my bf's and texted him the address. He was beyond pissed and was texting and calling me for hours. He tried to act like I left our son in an unsafe environment and said if I had told him my mom had cancelled that he could have figured something. Even my mom is on his side and said I should have let him know beforehand and given him the ability to veto.\n\nHe had already said he couldn't because of work, and I just would have had to go into finding another sitter at short notice.\n\nEdit: we don't have a custody agreement.", "created_utc": 1676498027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1139n3y/aita_for_leaving_my_son_at_my_boyfriends_house/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He said he couldn't take care of the kid because he had to work. She said her mom would watch the kid. She should have come back and said boyfriend is watching the kid, but she doesn't have to ask the dads permission to do things without her kid.

She had an alternative.

Dad, is there a reason you have a problem with this man? \n\nHim: well, I used to date his sister and we got into a fight years ago and I just don't like him\n\nJudge: is he violent? A criminal?

She should have told him, but it's not some big case where she would automatically lose custody for going on vacation. \n\nAs for the no significant other clauses, those are largely going away as we get away from puritanical beliefs dictating custody law. They also don't tend to apply to step parents, only unmarried partnerships. They are largely punishing to the primary caregiver, which tends to be women. No person who has custody of their kid 12 out of every 14 nights of the week should be held to the some arbitrary strict rules based on purity laws. You're putting rules into place that prevent primary caregivers from developing long term relationships while allowing the every other weekend parents plenty of opportunity to grow their relationships and move towards marriage much more easily. Here's a hint: of an every other weekend parent feels that the primary parent isn't capable of putting the best interest of their kids first, they should probably step up and stop being an every other weekend parent. Those types of rules are basically just an attempt to continue controlling the ex partner.", "No, you tell ex that said person will be watching the kid and ex is free to make other arrangements. It also wouldn't fly in court if ex refused to take the kid and vetoed the moms choice of caregiver and didn't offer any other solutions. Parents with primary custody are sometimes required to attend events/ do things that don't allow them to take care of their child. If the every other weekend parent doesn't want to step up, they don't get to say \"tough luck, you can't do xyz\".\n\nIf she were going to a work conference and ex said he couldn't take the boy because of work, is she supposed to cancel her work just because he doesn't like her boyfriend who is perfectly capable of watching the kid? That's not how the real world works. In the real world, if the primary parent needs childcare, they ask the secondary then they get to choose the caregiver.

I'm guessing he's just fine with all the other time they spend with boyfriend because otherwise it would mean that he has to actually be a parent to his kid more often. The son thinks of the man like an uncle, he's not some stranger.", "Or\nhey boss, can I please have off 2 weeks from now since my ex will be out of town?  \nHey boss, my son was abandoned. I need off this week.  You have no idea why he didn't take the time off originally.", "Lmao, the kid wasn't abandoned, he got to have an extended sleepover with his friend and a man he views as an uncle. She didn't have 2 weeks notice, the mom got sick right before she was supposed to leave. So then it becomes \"hey boss, I know it's Friday, but I need to take off next week\". I assume the dad felt like some of the other posters on here, which is \"I wouldn't use my time off to *help* my ex go on vacation but I'll use it so my son doesn't spend more time with this man I hate\". When really it should always have been about the kid, dad could have taken the opportunity to spend more time with his son since he's a weekend dad, but heaven forbid he use his time off to do something that would benefit the mom."]}
