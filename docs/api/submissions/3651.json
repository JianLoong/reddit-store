You cannot afford her attitude right now.", "NTA, holy shit. She's pregnant, not paralyzed, and it's not like this is her first rodeo. You're already stepping up to the plate in MAJOR way, and she's being totally unreasonable. In retrospect probably not all that surprising that the first kid's dad isn't in the picture, if this is how she behaves.", "NTA. She would be complaining if she lost her home because you couldn't pay the bills, or if she didn't have food to eat because you didn't have a job.\n\nPregnancy can be rough but she's not being realistic,  she's being an entitled brat, especially with preventing you from being at an ultrasound when you're just trying to be a responsible adult. There are plenty of pregnant women who have to work a fulltime job just to make ends meet. She at least gets to stay home.", "NTA.  Scheduled Appointments and  \"I don't feel good\" are two totally opposite matters.  Being pregnant does not give her the right be an AH.  The bills have to get paid and everyone in the household needs to eat.   If she wants to move in with her grandmother then help her pack and don't let her blackmail you.", "Damn she's either extremely manipulative or crazy hormonal. I'm guessing you guys haven't been together very long based on the 18 month old not being yours. You're NTA because your family can't live on you conforting her. I'd really reconsider this relationship and having a baby at all with this woman if possible. Good luck", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t accomplish anything for you to stay at home and get fired. \n\nIf she needs medical attention she should go to a doctor. If she\u2019s so sick she can\u2019t take care of the toddler she needs to call her grandmother. \n\nWhat exactly does she think happens when you don\u2019t work and have no money and can\u2019t pay rent or buy diapers or anything else for the kids? This is life 101 stuff.", "This madness has started when she was, like, four weeks pregnant? I can almost see how she collapsed with sudden, immense pain and wasn't able to lift her little finger alone as soon as the second line appeared on the pregnancy test.", "NTA and she\u2019s being immature. You need to work and make money for the baby. That is life. You\u2019re adults (I\u2019m assuming) and sometimes life sucks and that\u2019s that. She needs to handle her business while you handle yours. Plenty of women go through pregnancies/child raising while their spouses are gone for months at time with military, truck driving, etc. She is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.", "NTA oh come on she is being a brat. You need the job and she needs you to have the job. Hundreds of millions of women have managed through pregnancy and she can too. She sounds incredibly entitled and you are enabling her. She can get through this without being waited on.", "NTA. Let me guess, you\u2019re both under like 23 years old, aren\u2019t you?", "NTA - She is being ridiculous. If she is in such dire straights right now that she cannot be alone, then she needs to go to the hospital immediately to figure out what is wrong. Early pregnancy is rough, but not usually \"stay home with me even if it means losing your job and 90% of our household income\" rough.", "NTA! She\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s more than capable of running the household & taking care of her kid unless she has serious medical complications which prevent her from doing so. She\u2019s being entitled and stopping you going to an ultrasound is childish and cruel", "NTA. I was pregnant with my second when my oldest was 18 months. I understand it can be hard. But she cannot expect you to lose your job to be at her beckon call. It\u2019s completely unreasonable. If she needs that much help, she should go stay with grandma. I really hope for your sake her behavior is just early pregnancy hormones, but she is not being fair to you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not the worst idea for her to go live with the grandmother if she\u2019s having this many issues. I know loads of women do the two kids under age 2 thing but it just can\u2019t be easy. You just have to accept that your life is just kid-minding and self-minding. Also, it\u2019s okay if she goes to the ultrasound appointment by herself. Loads of women do that too. If she\u2019s going to try to make a huge deal about it and throw it in your face then the two of you need to have a real conversation about how to handle home life as a team.", "NTA. I had a high risk pregnancy and was never this needy. It's manipulation plain and simple by a lazy-ass woman who is using pregnancy to laze around and do nothing. I suspect that's why she got pregnant again so soon after her first. She doesn't seem capable or willing to even care for her first kid. Your job has to come first, unless it's a genuine emergency and nothing you've mentioned fits that.  Let her go live with her grandmother. You can still assert parental rights when your baby is born.", "Tell her she\u2019s gonna have to move in with granny anyway when you lose your job that pays all the bills lmao no.

Unless you are crazy in love with her let her go live with her grandma.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to understand (and you will need to tell her) that although you know she hasn't been feeling well, and you love and support her, you can't keep calling in sick all of the time.  Your supervisor has already made it crystal clear that if you do, you are going to get fired.  I don't know your financial situation, but kids come with expenses, and if you get fired, you are not going to be able to pay for the things that your family needs... housing/rent, food, doctor's visits, clothes, gas, etc.  People usually don't prioritize work over home because they like working so much... it's about paying the bills!\n\nUnless you have enough money lying around that you can afford to just stay home and not work at all, then you have to go to work and she needs to understand that... otherwise she is not living in reality.  If she can't understand that, how are you two ever going to make it in the real world once the bills start coming in?", "NTA.  Wtf is wrong w/ her??  How will the bills get paid if you don't work?", "NTA. She's being selfish, & I say that as a mother who went through pregnancy. You need to have income to keep a roof over your head & food on your table, & you're already on a warning at work for missing time. It's irresponsible to the point of idiocy that she expects you to stay home with her, knowing that you'll lose your job if you do.", "NTA. She's too selfish and immature to have one kid, much less two. You're going to be sorry you impregnated her and so is your kid.", "NTA. But you guys need birth control...", "NTA, dude you are completely fucked. If she\u2019s absolutely helpless at 7 weeks, and doesn\u2019t care than you\u2019ll lose your job because she doesn\u2019t feel good, it isn\u2019t going to get any better. You have signed up for 18 years of dealing with a terrible baby mama.", "She is extremely MANIPULATIVE for not letting you go to the ultrasound because you won\u2019t do what she says. Baby isn\u2019t even born yet and she\u2019s using it as a pawn against you. If you break up, get ready because she will 100% be one of those moms who keep the baby away from the dad because she can\u2019t control him.", "NTA \n\nDoes she want a roof over and her babies heads or do she want to be out on the streets? Go to work! You have a family to support her. Keeping food on the table and roof over y\u2019all heads is more important at the moment. She should ask her grandmother for help if she needs it or she can go to doctor to make sure everything is fine.", "Tell her move in with her grandmother then", "Pregnancy is not a disability. She keeps choosing to have kids so\u2026she needs to get a grip.", "I want to be empathetic towards your gf but are you some sort of superhuman that she expects you to pay the bills without a job? Cos she doesn't have a job, has an 18 months old, is expecting another kid, has the audacity to give ultimatums, asks if literally keeping a roof over her head is more important than...*checks note* holding her hand while nausea passes? \n\nNTA but you have bigger problems than getting fired from your job.", "NTA I have a very important rule - no partner, friend, sibling, or parent can mess with the job. The money that puts a roof over your head and pays heat and food has to come first or you could find yourself out on the street. I had vomiting really bad when I was pregnant. It was 24 hours of throwing up. I even ended up in hospital at 9 weeks pregnant on a drip of fluids and minerals. The drugs they gave me were so strong I couldn't stay awake, but I NEVER asked my husband to stay home from work for me. I would never ever make him late for work or skip work.", "NTA- my kids are 2 years apart. Which means I have been in the exact place your girlfriend is in- sicker than a dog- and I had a job! \n\nHell, right now I'm sick with some crap my kids gave to me and my husband's big bosses are in town so I'm pretty much on my own and feel like death. \n\nYou do what you gotta do. It means my kids are surviving on microwave popcorn and quesadillas for a couple days cause it's what they can make. Kids get pretty used to things like food and shelter- if you are making the money- she can dump cheerios in a bowl for the baby and make a nest on the couch for herself.", "NTA.

She\u2019s being pretty unfair, but if she has an 18 month old whose father dropped out on her, she might just be waiting for you leave (as in, she\u2019s concerned that you\u2019re going to let her down the way the last guy did). \n\nTry to be kind moving forward. Good luck!", "NTA. This behaviour is not sustainable. Since you are the provider in the householder what does she expect will happen if you lose your job.", "NTA", "NTA. GF needs to grow up.

Why isn\u2019t she the one waking, bathing, and feeding her son?", "NTA. If she had HG or some other major issue, her behavior might make sense, but ... it doesn't. I work part time, I have a 17 month old and I'm in my first trimester with #2. Tbh personally I am struggling to keep up with the housework now and the first trimester really does suck, but you seem to be helping out a lot at home and with the toddler, so I really don't get what her problem is, especially if grandma is also available to help.", "INFO: are you sure she\u2019s pregnant? Pain is not normal. Nausea and vomiting are normal, exhaustion is normal. Either she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s miscarrying, but \u201ca lot of pain\u201d is not a first trimester pregnancy symptom.", "**Pregnant women should not be taking Tylenol**. There are lawsuits. \n\nOtherwise NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBut,  you clearly feel that you are doing a lot at home, and she seems to feel differently. So, maybe just an honest discussion of expectations would help you! Maybe she's fine with doing dishes but making dinner makes her nauseous, so that is where is wants the help and not with the other, ya know?  \n\n\n\"I love you, and I want to help. Because I need to work X-amount of hours per week to pay our bills, How can I best help you when I'm home?\" might be a good place to start a conversation.  \n\n\nI was terribly sick with my fist baby, and not at all with my second. Needs change, and rapidly, during pregnancy. Keep checking in on her, and offer her the help she needs at the time she's needing it. Asking you to stay home for non-emergent issues just isn't doable, of course, and that's pretty non-negiotiable! But there is a lot that can be done when you're home.

My girlfriend and I recently found out we are expecting, and that she\u2019s about 7 weeks into her pregnancy. She already has a 18 month old who isn\u2019t mine but I consider to be mine. Now is where the issue begins. I work a part time job where my shifts range from 9 AM-6:30 PM to 12PM-6:30 PM. On the days I go in at 9 I get a 30 minute lunch break. With the time I have off I try to do as much as I can to help her out at home. I take our dogs out and feed them, I do the dishes or help her clean, I do laundry, and I help with her son. On my lunch breaks I wake her son up for the day, bathe him, and feed him. Most of the the time I don\u2019t even get to eat. After work I watch her son and the dogs so she can sleep or relax. Among other things. Ever since we found out she\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s been asking me to stay home when she is feeling the symptoms (nausea, cramps, fatigue, etc.) I started calling in to work multiple times a week. Either asking for a longer lunch, asking to come in later in the day when another coworker\u2019s shift is finished, or asking for the whole day off in total. After doing it frequently my manager wrote me up and informed me that if I kept calling in or showing up late that I would be fired. My paychecks pay almost the entirety of our bills so I can\u2019t afford to lose this job. Today she woke up in a lot of pain and asked me to call in to stay with her. I told her I can give her Tylenol and if she absolutely needs help that she should call her grandmother who usually helps with her son when we are both busy. Knowing that I\u2019ve been written up and threatened with my job, she gets angry with me and tells me that if work is always going to be more important than her and if she\u2019s never going to get any help, she\u2019ll move in with her grandmother and we need to reconsider our relationship. Now she\u2019s also refusing to tell me the date for our first ultrasound appointment because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to miss work\u201d. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do.

She should be extremely thankful for all you do for her and her son, especially seeing how many husbands find any excuse to not help.
