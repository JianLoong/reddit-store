Hell, you even make her pay for TP! Sure sounds like you love her \"like your own\". Oh, and you \"allow\" her to keep the rest of her paycheck? It's her own damn money!

To be honest, it sounds like you're closer to 19 than she is. I have never in my life just stopped and kicked someone out of the car no matter how much I wanted to. I understand being frustrated that she snapped at your child... but she snapped her fingers and yelled. She didn't hit the child or cause an incredible scene. \"She isn't the best housemate,\" means that you are to treat her like a housemate and not a child. Her room is her space and she's allowed for it to be messy if she wants, assuming no health hazards. The fact that she offered an explanation but you expected an apology also seems yucky. An apology would be nice, but that's some people's way of apologizing. Explanation works in adult relationships.", "ESH \n\nYeah she shouldn't have done that. And there's no excuse for not apologizing after you brought it up. \n\nBut like... Why on earth are you asking her for rent+chores ? It's either she's your daughter and does chores in her house or she's your tenant and does whatever she likes in her room and only cleans up after herself. Not both... And I have a 20 year old brother who lived with me for two years. So I get the whole annoying mess + teen thinking they're adults. But you gotta choose.
