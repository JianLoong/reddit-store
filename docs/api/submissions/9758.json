You set the boundaries for your own house. If anyone has a problem with it, they are the assholes.", "NTA\n\nYou are not Kay's mother, you are not responsible for her. It was nice that you helped out (though you did not mention of you were actually being paid for this or taken anywhere of) but it was never an obligation. \n\nRegardless of Kay's behavior or your sisters needs, no is a complete sentence. Kay could be a complain Saint, pleasant and gentle and generous and it would still be okay for you to say no.", "NTA Pat needs to find out asap that if she is not going to parent her kids no one else will want to do it for him. It's a good thing you've shown her that her behavior isn't as cute as she thinks it is. Other children won't want to play with Key if she can't play nice and that's her parents fault\n\nYou're really doing the best thing here for Key", "NTA\nQuit watching your niece.\nAny family who says otherwise is welcome to watch her themselves.  Don\u2019t listen to their abuse.", "NTA\n\nIf Kay's destructive behavior isn't that bad, then your family can take care of her. It's not a big deal, right?", "NTA\n\n And the family who calls you are more than welcome to babysit Kay. Please keep her away from your daughter. It's obvious she has some jealousy issues. Perhaps you are more gentle with your daughter than her mother is with her, or maybe your daughter has a father and she doesn't. But none of those are excuse and please please keep her away from your child.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister just doesn't want to parent anymore, and you make a convenient dumping ground for her child. Set your boundaries and stand by them. Your little girl may be too young to remember this, but you're setting a good example by not letting your sister and her daughter run roughshod over you.", "NTA\n\nYou're going to have to be unavailable to pick your niece up.  Make sure you are out so you won't get caught in a lie and you are too far away to get there in time to pick your child up.  You could just be in a park the next town over... or the library the next town over sort of thing.\n\nAs for your niece.  It sounds like it would be worth her mother getting her assessed for a neurodiversity.  Some of her behaviour sounds like it could be ADHD.  Impulsive and all over the place. She may not actually be doing any of this deliberately but you can't use it as an excuse.  If she needs help, she needs help.\n\nBut there's a part of me that wonders whether this is actually related to her home life and she's actually acting out because of what she sees at home.\n\nIt kinda speaks volumes that your sister has 4 kids but only the 8 year old is with her.  Her kids can't be that old if she is only 35.", "NTA and it sounds like that family complaining to you can take Kay the Destroyer if they think you're so mean. I might feel a very little bit differently if it weren't for Pat laughing off bad behavior. Like, if she knew there was a problem and was trying to work through it with her, it'd be one thing. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n8 and 35 are both old enough to learn that wanton destruction and theft have consequences.", "NTA:\nThese are completely reasonable boundaries. My nieces (that I adore) are all under eight years old and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of behavior from them in my house either. It is totally your prerogative to establish what behaviors you\u2019re willing to tolerate and not tolerate in your home. You\u2019re not banning Kay forever, just until she  and your sister are able to respect your boundaries. Ultimately, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re in no way obligated to babysit for anyone, even a family member. My sister and I would do anything for each other but I would never expect her to be my beck and call for my child care and vice versa.", "NTA.\n\nKay's parents ARE TAs, but  that's because she need intervention NOW before things get worse.\n\nThat is NOT norrmal behavior for an eight year old.", "So your sister, instead of asking the rest of your family for help, rallied them against you? And your family, instead of offering to help her, reached you to guilt trip you? Say, was your sister anything like her daughter when she was young? NTA. If you care about what your family thinks of you, write a list (with pictures if possible) of everything your niece broke. I will bet you 200$ your sister didn't tell them the whole truth. Otherwise, just tell them to go pick up your niece themselves, you have a daughter and more important things to do", "NTA. The rest of the family can babysit.", "NTA - Just because you're at home doesn't mean you automatically become the go to babysitter for your niece. If its not adding to your peace then it shouldn't be part of your life. Imagine if instead of breaking things she decides to take her rage toward your daughter, then you have an injured child on your hands instead of missing candy, broken toys, stolen money, etc.", ">Now my family is calling me out saying I turned my back on my family\n\nMake a list of everything this kid has broken or stolen, send it to them, and tell them to take her.

You're turning your back on your granddaughter then don't answer them for a week.", "NTA\n\nIf you had no children and were comfortable with a little destructive out of control 8 year old without proper parental guidance in your home, that would be one thing.  But you have a toddler to think of, and it's not OK for her things to be intentionally destroyed by anyone else.\n\nStick to your guns.  Your boundaries are reasonable.  And maybe this will be a wake-up call to your sister to become a better parent.\n\n(I also think that there's a possibility that there's a ton of jealousy here leading to the destructiveness, in which case, if Kay ever returns to your house, you can't ever leave her alone in a room with your much younger child.  It won't be safe.)", "NTA - \"But Because Family!!!\" is the single worst excuse that's regular on here. Your family can be assholes/morons/thieves/etc.. just like anyone else.

I haven't given the kid any consequences for their actions at my home because of my gentle parenting ideals, but now I've chosen the nuclear option and she isn't welcome anymore because her mom hasn't fixed her behavioral issues that only happen around me' that whole attitude just sounds a bit AH'ish and dellusional to me.", "[removed]", "\u201c\u2026cuz she knows I won\u2019t yell or spank\u2026\u201d\n\nIt sounds more like OP and Pat have different ideas of what\u2019s an acceptable consequence, not that the gentle parenting isn\u2019t working or OP is doing it wrong.

It would be interesting to record what she does so OP can show it to her sister and parents.  They might learn something, like for instance what is really going on that her sister isn't telling them.", "NTA! You\u2019re babysitting for free?!? Yeah, no you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that kind of behavior", "stop answering her calls and texts. things are going to be different now. u no longer have time to babysit. this isn't fair to u or your daughter and quite frankly i'm concerned that she'll eventually move on to hurting your daughter instead of just breaking her stuff.", "OP is not TA and has no reason to feel guilty since  Pat has other family that will step in take over all the baby sitting for Kay. Of course they will!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nof", "NTA, but I think you need to separate the things to be asking her parents to enforce on your behalf (breaking things, lying etc.) and the things that are passive and something her parents should worry about (sugar intake etc)", "NTA - stick to your boundaries and protect your daughter/her stuff. Also I would let them help pick up your niece - I didn\u2019t read in the description that they are chipping in.", "NTA. Let the family complaining step up and look after jay", "NTA. Anyone who believes you\u2019re overreacting can be the sitter going forward", "This is the way.", "Kids grow up how they are raised. This lil girl is on route to becoming a monster, knowing she has mom/family backing up her bad behavior. to what is best for the child future you have to be stern and ignore the \"puppy eyes\" and it sounds like mom and family sadly have no clue to how/why kids turn rotten as they grow."]}
