You set the boundaries for your own house. If anyone has a problem with it, they are the assholes.", "NTA\n\nYou are not Kay's mother, you are not responsible for her. It was nice that you helped out (though you did not mention of you were actually being paid for this or taken anywhere of) but it was never an obligation. \n\nRegardless of Kay's behavior or your sisters needs, no is a complete sentence. Kay could be a complain Saint, pleasant and gentle and generous and it would still be okay for you to say no.", "NTA Pat needs to find out asap that if she is not going to parent her kids no one else will want to do it for him. It's a good thing you've shown her that her behavior isn't as cute as she thinks it is. Other children won't want to play with Key if she can't play nice and that's her parents fault\n\nYou're really doing the best thing here for Key", "NTA\nQuit watching your niece.\nAny family who says otherwise is welcome to watch her themselves.  Don\u2019t listen to their abuse.", "NTA\n\nIf Kay's destructive behavior isn't that bad, then your family can take care of her. It's not a big deal, right?", "NTA\n\n And the family who calls you are more than welcome to babysit Kay. Please keep her away from your daughter. It's obvious she has some jealousy issues. Perhaps you are more gentle with your daughter than her mother is with her, or maybe your daughter has a father and she doesn't. But none of those are excuse and please please keep her away from your child.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister just doesn't want to parent anymore, and you make a convenient dumping ground for her child. Set your boundaries and stand by them. Your little girl may be too young to remember this, but you're setting a good example by not letting your sister and her daughter run roughshod over you.", "NTA\n\nYou're going to have to be unavailable to pick your niece up.  Make sure you are out so you won't get caught in a lie and you are too far away to get there in time to pick your child up.  You could just be in a park the next town over... or the library the next town over sort of thing.\n\nAs for your niece.  It sounds like it would be worth her mother getting her assessed for a neurodiversity.  Some of her behaviour sounds like it could be ADHD.  Impulsive and all over the place. She may not actually be doing any of this deliberately but you can't use it as an excuse.  If she needs help, she needs help.\n\nBut there's a part of me that wonders whether this is actually related to her home life and she's actually acting out because of what she sees at home.\n\nIt kinda speaks volumes that your sister has 4 kids but only the 8 year old is with her.  Her kids can't be that old if she is only 35.", "NTA and it sounds like that family complaining to you can take Kay the Destroyer if they think you're so mean. I might feel a very little bit differently if it weren't for Pat laughing off bad behavior. Like, if she knew there was a problem and was trying to work through it with her, it'd be one thing. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n8 and 35 are both old enough to learn that wanton destruction and theft have consequences.", "NTA:\nThese are completely reasonable boundaries. My nieces (that I adore) are all under eight years old and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of behavior from them in my house either. It is totally your prerogative to establish what behaviors you\u2019re willing to tolerate and not tolerate in your home. You\u2019re not banning Kay forever, just until she  and your sister are able to respect your boundaries. Ultimately, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re in no way obligated to babysit for anyone, even a family member. My sister and I would do anything for each other but I would never expect her to be my beck and call for my child care and vice versa.", "NTA.\n\nKay's parents ARE TAs, but  that's because she need intervention NOW before things get worse.\n\nThat is NOT norrmal behavior for an eight year old.", "So your sister, instead of asking the rest of your family for help, rallied them against you? And your family, instead of offering to help her, reached you to guilt trip you? Say, was your sister anything like her daughter when she was young? NTA. If you care about what your family thinks of you, write a list (with pictures if possible) of everything your niece broke. I will bet you 200$ your sister didn't tell them the whole truth. Otherwise, just tell them to go pick up your niece themselves, you have a daughter and more important things to do", "NTA. The rest of the family can babysit.", "NTA - Just because you're at home doesn't mean you automatically become the go to babysitter for your niece. If its not adding to your peace then it shouldn't be part of your life. Imagine if instead of breaking things she decides to take her rage toward your daughter, then you have an injured child on your hands instead of missing candy, broken toys, stolen money, etc.", ">Now my family is calling me out saying I turned my back on my family\n\nMake a list of everything this kid has broken or stolen, send it to them, and tell them to take her.

You're turning your back on your granddaughter then don't answer them for a week.", "NTA\n\nIf you had no children and were comfortable with a little destructive out of control 8 year old without proper parental guidance in your home, that would be one thing.  But you have a toddler to think of, and it's not OK for her things to be intentionally destroyed by anyone else.\n\nStick to your guns.  Your boundaries are reasonable.  And maybe this will be a wake-up call to your sister to become a better parent.\n\n(I also think that there's a possibility that there's a ton of jealousy here leading to the destructiveness, in which case, if Kay ever returns to your house, you can't ever leave her alone in a room with your much younger child.  It won't be safe.)", "NTA - \"But Because Family!!!\" is the single worst excuse that's regular on here. Your family can be assholes/morons/thieves/etc.. just like anyone else.

You do NOT have to put up with Kay\u2019s behavior, or have her over until her mother sees to it that Kay will never do this again. She needs to parent and teach HER child; you do not have to put up with HER child\u2019s poor behavior.", "It doesn't fall on you and you don't have to put up with it. You choose to.  Actually realize and understand the difference so you can start making the choice not to.", "Her behavior could be neurodivergence, being spoiled, and acting out because of something at home.\n\n There's no reason to believe that it's a single cause issue, those three things could be ping-ponging around, each making the situation worse.", "I also am an Autist, as are 2/3 of my children. The 3rd is neurodivergent also, but rather has ADHD. However, at 8,  they did not regularly destroy others property or steal. Neither did I as a child. While I understand the concern of neurodivergency, it frustrates me we get pegged this way. We can learn boundaries and do have self control. None of these behaviors should be tolerated. It's not good for anyone and is detrimental to your niece long-term.  \n\nThat said, getting an evaluation can help her get the supports she needs no matter what the root cause is.", "I'm pretty sure her niece is a \"her\".", "Who's him?", "Who's Amy?", "Replying to the wrong post there.", "\\*Britney's song *If You Seek Amy* plays in the background\\*", "Yep I think she's breaking things on purpose", "> She's 8, she's not dumb, she clearly knows not to break her own stuff.\n\nI wonder what would happen if OP whispered in her ear that if anything else breaks because it was played with too roughly and was broken on purpose, that OP will only babysit at their house from now on and it will be her turn to have fun.\n\n>The people calling to complain to OP can watch the destructive child since they're sooo concerned.\n\nYes. It sounds like it is their turn to deal with this and maybe they won't be as mild about it as OP. Her mom should have bent over backwards to show her appreciation for safe on-call free babysitting. Maybe now that she has thrown away OP's help she'll value it more. I guess she thought it wasn't a problem as long as it was only someone else's problem.", "H.I.M.", "Wrong thread", "NTA.  Why does your single mom sister only have custody of ONE of her FOUR children?  Sounds like this little girl is acting out - perhaps because she is jealous, does not have the coping skills, etc.  Her destruction should not be tolerated, and I'd be concerned having her around your toddler.  Your sister is the AH for taking advantage of you & complaining about you to the family.  Nope - they can babysit, she can utilize after school daycare, get the dad/his family involved to help.  This is NOT your problem.  Enjoy your baby, don't let anyone guilt you.  And your niece needs a social worker at school to help her deal with her feelings in a more appropriate way.", "NTA.   You're being used.   On top of not getting paid for babysitting, the child is destroying property that isn't being replaced.  You're losing money every time that kid walks in your house.\n\nIt amazes me, the people who can't be bothered to correct their ill-mannered, destructive little heathens.  Then they wonder why no one wants to babysit.   Yeah - that's a real head-scratcher.   If you want people to enjoy spending time with your kids, you have to raise kids that are enjoyable to be around.", "NTA\n\nYou were doing it for free and your sister brushed off the problems created by her kid. I am not sure if the niece is an angel at home (maybe she's tired after a day spent at your place), but she's not your responsability.\n\nAnd i don't know why your sister has only 1 of 4 kids... Maybe bad parenting, who knows...\n\nTell your family to talk to you after they babysit her.", "NTA", "Is anyone else wondering whether she's (Kay) is jealous of the baby? As it's the baby's items that are broken. \n\nThe gentle parenting isn't helping as the 8-year-old is walking all over op. It is interesting to note that whilst the parent discipline holds over the child's own belonging. It's interesting that Pat is not instructing kid not to destroy the baby's stuff. Maybe she doesn't respect ops gentle parenting style. \ud83e\udd14 \n\nGood for op for finally standing up. \n\nI'm very worried for the baby. I wouldn't want the baby to be hurt. It feels like a short step.", "Good NTA, you are not wrong at all. Niece needs to learn and no one is willing to give her consequences. Those that are criticising you can babysit her.", "NTA. If your family thins it is so important to babysit your destructive niece, let them babysit her and see how long that will last. If they even agree to do it, which I doubt.", "NTAH- and it seems like your niece is deliberately destroying things because she knows she can get away with it.", "NTA.  \"Just a kid' is an excuse from parents who don't want to actually parent their kid.  if the parents don't want to bother enforcing consequences for bad behavior, the rest of the world will do it for them because actions always have consequences whether bad parents like it or not.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Now my family is calling me out saying I turned my back on my family\" .. these AHs can step up to babysit themselves.", "INFO: How far apart are you and your sisters place? If I had to keep worrying about that, I'd stop bringing the kid to mine and just start taking them to theirs. Inconvenient for you, sure, but nothing in your place gets broken. If sister wants you to keep watching your niece you need a key to her place.", "NTA. She sounds like a brat who's mother is enabling her behavior.", "Nta. Let the other family members watch her or pay for daycare.  Your house, your rules.", "NTA.\n\n\"No.\" is a complete sentence. \n\nAlso, regarding all of the last minute calls for help, \"poor planning on her part doesn't constitute an emergency for you.\"", "NTA.  The rest of the family is welcome to have Kay destroy their homes.  Hold your boundary and I would very much not trust that niece around your little ever.  There is something wrong with that kid and you don\u2019t want your child involved.", "nta", "NTA they are being ridiculous everything that has ever been broken should be replaced.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Your family is missing some serious red flags with your niece. Do not have her at your house anymore.", "NTA just reiterate \"I'm not turning my back on Kay. The day she is able to behave at a reasonable standard for an 8 year old, I'll be delighted to resume babysitting her.\"", "NTA.  It sounds like Kay is jealous of your daughter since she is only breaking your daughter's things. Did you babysit Kay before your daughter was born?  Eight is old enough to know better than to break your daughter's things, and her mother is not holding her accountable. What happens if Kay escalates to trying to break your daughter instead of just her things?  Until Kay can behave at your home, she should not be at your home.  Let the family members that say you turned your back on family take care of Kay while you protect your daughter and her things.", "Nta", "NTA. Your sister has 4 children and only one of them is in her care, those are the kind of things your family should be up in arms about.", "NTA. Imo the worst things you've done here are a) allow this to go on for so long and not refusing to look after her sooner, like about the time Pat refused to take responsibility and said \"she's just a kid\", and b) questioning your decision to the point of posting about it here. And I say that not because those things are that bad, but just to show how much I don't think you're making the wrong choice and should stick to it regardless of what the rest of your family thinks (who are likely just trying to manipulate you into helping again so that they won't have to or feel bad about turning her down themselves).", "Or has investments in the stock market or has a trust fund...", "You do know there are more sources of passive income than being a landlord, right?", "Right, no more babysitting at all. Ever. If she doesn't act like that at home, how can you ever be sure she's changed? Your home shouldn't be the test facility for her behavior. Let her mother make the rounds through your family until everyone is tired of their houses being destroyed.", "Honestly, my first thought was \u2018Kay is an affair baby, and the other kids live with dad\u2019, lol.\n\nI spend WAY too much time here\u2026.", "Or the reason it doesn't happen at home is because at home, all the toys and things belong to the kid. If the kid is purposely breaking the items that belong to OP's child, then boundaries and consequences at home have nothing to do with it. It's access that is what's causing the behaviour to happen in one house and not the other.\n\nPat is the one who, when told about the behaviour, essentially went 'kids gonna be kids'. That sounds a lot more permissive than what OP is doing.", "She is not your responsibilty, so you do not have to put up with it.", "Or is a silent/minority partner in a business", "I mean, I think the person you\u2019re responding to is wrong in what they\u2019re posting, but I\u2019m not fond of most landlords either. \n\nMost landlords are big companies that buy as many properties and land as they can which drives up not only rent but house prices too so less and less people can afford to buy a home. So I\u2019m 100% on board with getting rid of those landlords. \n\nThe only smaller ones that I\u2019d like to see go away are the ones who buy up places and then instead of renting them out to long term tenants they turn them into an Airbnb. Again driving up rent for other people\n\nSo forget about home ownership, I\u2019m concerned that people can\u2019t afford to rent a place.", "I meet a lot of \"gentle\" parents that are really just \"permissive.\".  They don't like it when their kid misbehaves, but they don't do anything about it.\n\nApplied correctly, gentle parenting is *much* more time intensive than yelling or spanking.  You talk and do time-ins and still have consequences, like a loss of screen time or restricted access to toys or areas of the house.\nIf it only happens when OP goes to use the toilet or leaves the room, then 8 year old goes with her or sits on the floor outside the toilet until she can be trusted to not break things/steal things/etc.\n\nTo me, the post reads like the 8 year old is breaking things on purpose, fully expecting OP to respond like she always does and just...  Not do anything.  That means the \"price\" of breaking things has been very very cheap up until now.  Going zero to 60 over the last event is what makes this pretty crappy.\n\nSet boundaries early and often.  Waiting until it's a breaking point and then jumping immediately to the max is poor communication.", "I read a useful definition recently: rules are something set for other people. Boundaries are something you do. So the rule is that Kay isn\u2019t allowed to break her cousin\u2019s stuff. The boundary is that if Kay keeps breaking her cousin\u2019s stuff then you will not let her in your house anymore.", "As a mother with ADHD (only medicated as an adult), who has 2 children, one of them also having ADHD.. absolutely agreed. \n\nI was sitting here thinking, I know everyone is different, but if this girl's toys are just fine but she destroys other's toys, what about that equates to ADHD? Also the stealing & purposely hiding things..\n\nYes, a big thing with those of us with ADHD is struggling with impulsivity control, but so are a lot of other things. Including ODD. I certainly would guess ODD before ADHD came to mind. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly. There are way more ways to earn passive income than just being a landlord.
