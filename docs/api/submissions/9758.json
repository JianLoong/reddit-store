Since I have more flexible time (I make passive income) I babysit my niece \u201cKay\u201d (8f) a lot for my sister \u201cPat\u201d (35f). She has 4 kids but only Kay lives w her. She\u2019s a single mom so when Kay needs to be picked up from school, or when Pat gets off late etc. I get her. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind at first cuz I love my niece, but she\u2019s very destructive. I keep age appropriate toys around for her, and give her control of the tv when she\u2019s over since my daughter just likes the colors and sounds and doesn\u2019t really care what\u2019s on. \n\nBut almost every time Kay is over she breaks something of my daughters. A toy, furniture, something that literally shouldn\u2019t be easily broken at all\u2026 you name it. And it happens so fast. I could go pee and come back something\u2019s broken. \n\nAt first I ignored it, but after a while I started complaining to Pat she either needs to replace what gets broken or start paying me to babysit since most times it\u2019s last minute (like 10-20 minutes before Kay needs to be picked up which has been getting on my nerves as well since I have to rush to get me and my baby dressed) and it\u2019s getting frustrating. Pair that w Kay constantly lying and stealing (toys, money, snacks) I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nTo be clear she can have snacks but I personally control how much sugar she has. If she wants an apple sure, if she\u2019s on her 2nd candy bar we gotta talk. But Kay would go into my bedroom and open something I have and try to hide or lie about it. \n\nPat always laughs it off and says Kay is just a kid and whatever excuse. I think it\u2019s messed up. Kay never messes up or loses the toys she brings over. And at her house she\u2019s always very careful and polite. \n\nI gentle parent so idk if Kay thinks she can get away w whatever cuz she knows I won\u2019t yell or spank but it\u2019s been frustrating me so much. I\u2019ve tried talking to her or asking how she would feel if someone messed up her stuff but she puts on puppy eyes says sorry and is right back at it shortly after. \n\nI\u2019m not struggling, but I\u2019m not rich either and I do what I can to give my daughter what she has. \n\nAfter the last time (Kay broke a toy shelf my friend made for my baby) I told Pat she was no longer welcome in my house until she can behave better. \n\nNow my family is calling me out saying I turned my back on my family but I\u2019m just tired of it. 8 is more than old enough to know better.

I love when families get up in arms when you finally set boundaries. \"If you think that I'm turning my back on family, why don't you step the f*ck up and watch her?\"", "NTA. You set the boundaries for your own house. If anyone has a problem with it, they are the assholes.", "NTA\n\nYou are not Kay's mother, you are not responsible for her. It was nice that you helped out (though you did not mention of you were actually being paid for this or taken anywhere of) but it was never an obligation. \n\nRegardless of Kay's behavior or your sisters needs, no is a complete sentence. Kay could be a complain Saint, pleasant and gentle and generous and it would still be okay for you to say no.", "NTA Pat needs to find out asap that if she is not going to parent her kids no one else will want to do it for him. It's a good thing you've shown her that her behavior isn't as cute as she thinks it is. Other children won't want to play with Key if she can't play nice and that's her parents fault\n\nYou're really doing the best thing here for Key", "NTA\nQuit watching your niece.\nAny family who says otherwise is welcome to watch her themselves.  Don\u2019t listen to their abuse.", "NTA\n\nIf Kay's destructive behavior isn't that bad, then your family can take care of her. It's not a big deal, right?", "NTA\n\n And the family who calls you are more than welcome to babysit Kay. Please keep her away from your daughter. It's obvious she has some jealousy issues. Perhaps you are more gentle with your daughter than her mother is with her, or maybe your daughter has a father and she doesn't. But none of those are excuse and please please keep her away from your child.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister just doesn't want to parent anymore, and you make a convenient dumping ground for her child. Set your boundaries and stand by them. Your little girl may be too young to remember this, but you're setting a good example by not letting your sister and her daughter run roughshod over you.", "NTA\n\nYou're going to have to be unavailable to pick your niece up.  Make sure you are out so you won't get caught in a lie and you are too far away to get there in time to pick your child up.  You could just be in a park the next town over... or the library the next town over sort of thing.\n\nAs for your niece.  It sounds like it would be worth her mother getting her assessed for a neurodiversity.  Some of her behaviour sounds like it could be ADHD.  Impulsive and all over the place. She may not actually be doing any of this deliberately but you can't use it as an excuse.  If she needs help, she needs help.\n\nBut there's a part of me that wonders whether this is actually related to her home life and she's actually acting out because of what she sees at home.\n\nIt kinda speaks volumes that your sister has 4 kids but only the 8 year old is with her.  Her kids can't be that old if she is only 35.", "NTA and it sounds like that family complaining to you can take Kay the Destroyer if they think you're so mean. I might feel a very little bit differently if it weren't for Pat laughing off bad behavior. Like, if she knew there was a problem and was trying to work through it with her, it'd be one thing. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n8 and 35 are both old enough to learn that wanton destruction and theft have consequences.", "NTA:\nThese are completely reasonable boundaries. My nieces (that I adore) are all under eight years old and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of behavior from them in my house either. It is totally your prerogative to establish what behaviors you\u2019re willing to tolerate and not tolerate in your home. You\u2019re not banning Kay forever, just until she  and your sister are able to respect your boundaries. Ultimately, it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re in no way obligated to babysit for anyone, even a family member. My sister and I would do anything for each other but I would never expect her to be my beck and call for my child care and vice versa.", "NTA.\n\nKay's parents ARE TAs, but  that's because she need intervention NOW before things get worse.\n\nThat is NOT norrmal behavior for an eight year old.", "So your sister, instead of asking the rest of your family for help, rallied them against you? And your family, instead of offering to help her, reached you to guilt trip you? Say, was your sister anything like her daughter when she was young? NTA. If you care about what your family thinks of you, write a list (with pictures if possible) of everything your niece broke. I will bet you 200$ your sister didn't tell them the whole truth. Otherwise, just tell them to go pick up your niece themselves, you have a daughter and more important things to do", "NTA. The rest of the family can babysit.", "NTA - Just because you're at home doesn't mean you automatically become the go to babysitter for your niece. If its not adding to your peace then it shouldn't be part of your life. Imagine if instead of breaking things she decides to take her rage toward your daughter, then you have an injured child on your hands instead of missing candy, broken toys, stolen money, etc.", ">Now my family is calling me out saying I turned my back on my family\n\nMake a list of everything this kid has broken or stolen, send it to them, and tell them to take her. NTA.\n\n>My brother is always \u201ctoo tired\u201d and my parents are always \u201ctoo busy\u201d to do it so it falls on me.\n\nJust say it back to them. You're turning your back on your granddaughter then don't answer them for a week.", "NTA\n\nIf you had no children and were comfortable with a little destructive out of control 8 year old without proper parental guidance in your home, that would be one thing.  But you have a toddler to think of, and it's not OK for her things to be intentionally destroyed by anyone else.\n\nStick to your guns.  Your boundaries are reasonable.  And maybe this will be a wake-up call to your sister to become a better parent.\n\n(I also think that there's a possibility that there's a ton of jealousy here leading to the destructiveness, in which case, if Kay ever returns to your house, you can't ever leave her alone in a room with your much younger child.  It won't be safe.)", "NTA - \"But Because Family!!!\" is the single worst excuse that's regular on here. Your family can be assholes/morons/thieves/etc.. just like anyone else. Get rid of them and you will be happier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But maybe it is also testing the boundries. Either you would have to clearly tell her, that she has to behave or you have to tell your sister, that she must give your niece clear instructions 'don't break anything, behave'. Maybe ask your sister if you are allowed to give your niece a 'time out' or something like that, if she misbehave. So you can give her consequences (and then you have to pull through with those. \n\nBut if you ar enot able to do.

You are setting boundaries and it's not wrong to do so. It's obvious that Kay has some issues that Pat needs to address, but that doesn't mean you have to be the one who cleans up after her messes. It's your house and you should choose who is welcome in it. You're not turning your back on family, you're protecting your own.", "YTA\n\nsounds like there's something going on with your niece that she's acting out... would suggest taking extra looks and seeing what's wrong rather than punishing her... that's not normal behaviour for a kid of that age... has nothing to do with \"knowing better\" but you do you seems like in 18 months you've become a parenting expert", "This!", "I have ASD (tho I am considered \u201chigh functioning\u201d)  and asked my sister about getting her tested but she refuses.

She could be doing this as she is jealous of your daughter and not having your full attention anymore.", "NTA.

What is she even doing with her life?", "NTA. Listen, your sister knows exactly what\u2019s going on. There seems to be a lot of backstory with her other kids too. You are being used! And, like most nice people, you feel like you need to even find a justification for your decision.  You don\u2019t! No more babysitting, period. Your sister won\u2019t get it until your actions speak for yourself.", "Right, if she really wants to help her sister out maybe she can watch the kid at her sister\u2019s house so at least her sister\u2019s stuff gets broken", "My best friend has a little girl who\u2019s about seven, and she\u2019s honestly a horrible little kid.

Or maybe you suddenly have activities with your daughter outside of your home after school\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your sister can handle parenthood if she\u2019s already lost all her other kids, by helping her out you may actually be hurting this child. If she can\u2019t parent this child she needs to let it go to someone who can and you picking up the slack is just hurting the kid more. It\u2019s enabling your sister to hang onto a kid she can\u2019t take care of and it\u2019s obviously hurting this child look at her behavior.
