You loaned him money that you could not comfortably afford to help him out with his agreement to repay you. He should have brought you the money before you had to ask. Acting irritated that you are asking for your money back is a real AH move.", "NTA your roommate was, unless you needed the money right away you could have been more diplomatic by asking him for the transfer by Saturday instead of asking for it now.", "NTA. Seems like you spaced out the requests over a few days, which is normal. He seems huffy because *he* didn't pay it back and got nagged, which is on him.", "NTA. It\u2019s a common trick for people who don\u2019t want to live up to obligations to make you feel guilty when you ask for something that they have promised. The idea is to make it so uncomfortable that you will think twice about doing it next time. \n\nYou did not handle it badly. Your roommate just didn\u2019t want to live up to his promise.", "NTA.  It sounds like your friend took offense at the perception that you didn't think he was ever going to pay you, which is actually the likely outcome.
