I used to listen to a *lot* of podcasts to pass the time. My favorite podcast is a true crime one. They had a special episode on the practice and science of beheading that I was listening to while I was feeding her. She was maybe 9 or 10 mos old at that point. She kept wiggling in her seat and moving her arms as she looked at me for approval. It took me a hot second to figure out what she was doing, then it clicked for me that every time the hosts mentioned the words \u201cbeheading\u201d or \u201cdecapitation\u201d She was tapping on her head. She was looking for my approval because she recognized we were talking about heads and she wanted me to be proud of her. Big oops on my part. Obviously she wasn\u2019t grasping the full content, but it was a good reminder to me that she was listening and learning at a rate that I wasn\u2019t recognizing. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s absolutely not your job to parent any of your nieces and nephews. It is certainly up to the parents to teach their kids right and wrong, as well as what is appropriate vs inappropriate behavior and language in different settings. It sounds like you and your SIL don\u2019t have a good relationship. Whatever. I\u2019m not going to shit on you for that. You can\u2019t force people to get along (nor should you) and family can fucking suck (I\u2019m very low contact with most of my family because of this). \n\nRegardless of your relationship with your SIL, do you care about your nieces and nephews? Honestly asking out of curiosity. You again don\u2019t owe anybody a relationship, and you shouldn\u2019t force one if you\u2019re not interested for whatever reason. \n\nI ask because I grew up in the Boston area. Everyone cusses here, it\u2019s just an expected part of the vernacular. My uncle Teddy has a reeeaaalll potty mouth. My mom called him out on it when I was really young, and she also established a swear jar. Nearly the same interaction happened. He would walk into the house, drop a 20 in the jar, say, \u201cI\u2019m good for the next 2 hours\u201d and speak freely. It worked because he cared about me. It was a running joke for our family. He contributed to the jar because he loved me. The jar became known as my college fund. It was fun to crack open that baby when I graduated from high school. With the cost of education as it is now, it was really only enough to buy some books when I was in under grad, but that was just a bonus. He has Alzheimer\u2019s now, and usually doesn\u2019t remember how old I am, or that I\u2019m in med school. But he still brings up how much he loves me, and talks about how proud he is, and how he\u2019s going to send me to college some day. I fucking love my uncle Teddy. \n\nI learned not to cuss in certain contexts, because the adults in my life taught me so. But I also have fond memories of my uncle from a young age, because I was in on the joke and he was doing it out of love for me. I\u2019m not going to say that you don\u2019t love your nieces and nephews. I\u2019m also not going to say that the only way to express love to them is by contributing to the swear jar.\n\nUltimately, the decision of how to proceed is up to you.

The extent of our convo about that was just telling her I\u2019m not mad, but other adults may get upset, so it\u2019s best to wait until she\u2019s older because it\u2019s an adult word and friend\u2019s parents/teachers would be upset if they heard her or their kid say it.

Don\u2019t want a kid to curse, just lay out what consequences may come from others and ask them to wait or at least do it in private. The second a kid realizes the word holds weight their gonna want to use it. If you leave it as a \u201cnot right now because of x reason, but when you\u2019re older\u201d and don\u2019t freak out if a kid says one, they won\u2019t care much about cursing. I\u2019ve never met a child that heard someone curse and just went wild with it unless it was due to trauma. Like I work with kids on the spectrum and when echolalia kicks in we don\u2019t get upset with them for what they said when repeating curse words or unkind things they\u2019ve heard, we just help the kid work through whatever is upsetting them.\n\nIf her kid doesn\u2019t talk yet tho, I\u2019m kinda hoping the first word is a curse word lol.

But is apologizing for the word something that could mean something to the 1yo ? The fact is, they heard the word, could remember it and reproduce it, but they have no idea of what it means and that it's a bad word, so apologizing for it makes absolutely no sense.
