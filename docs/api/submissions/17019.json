The words aren\u2019t bad, they just aren\u2019t for kids.\n\nKids don\u2019t get to drive, or drink, or smoke.  They also don\u2019t get to say certain words yet.  \n\nAdults never really moderated their speech around me, I know right from wrong and what words to use at work etc.  Hearing them isn\u2019t the problem, they just need context.", "What about the other words?", "Why not react a 50-59 deal", "My cat said OP should put 50 in the jar next time and stand next to the kid whispering fuck in his ear until the money runs out. But my cat is slightly evil.", "I think they\u2019re saying the words themselves don\u2019t matter\u2026", "I'd tell her to get effed, but she doesn't need an 8th.", "Jesus fuck. You should have proposed that the curse jar funds should be used to neuter her and then gave a charitable donation on her behalf.", "At least you won't ever see her again", "You'd be surprised how many things those minds absorb to suddenly produce them months later not knowing where it came from", "Sorry but for me neither one was on around kids not drinking and not cursing", "There are good reasons kids don't get to drive, drink or smoke. Why don't kids get to say certain words?", "None of them.  He lets us know if a movie is inappropriate now. He\u2019s a better person than me but that\u2019s luck not parenting.", "Sounds like the devil. Not a \"slightly evil\" cat\ud83d\udc80", "Which i agreed with in my reply", "Sir, we live in a society.", "I would argue that expletives carry a lot more power than other words. They're very useful in the right context. To say to a kid \"don't say that until you're older\" helps to bring that home to them.\n\nI also think there are other words not considered curse words that this could apply to. Hate for example. A child saying they hate another child in their class doesn't really understand the emotion behind that word. You might dislike a child in your class, but hate should be reserved for really heinous concepts and only occasionally people.", "Honestly, I really don't understand it. We decided certain grunts make words and those words have meanings, then said that some of those words are \"profane\" and not to be used in polite company, but words that mean the exact same thing are okay, and then some words are okay unless they're being used to mean certain things. I don't get it. If I say \"We're trying for a baby\" everyone's all \"Aww congratulations!\", but if I say \"My head game is bananas\", that's out of line, despite it not containing a single profane word and being less sexual than the former.", "I could interpret your concise argument as support for adults moderating their language around children."]}
