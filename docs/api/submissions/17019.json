I think if the step sister would've been like \"hey, could you watch your language around my kid please?\" in a non-combative way, then you seem like the type of guy who'd apologize for that. But the swear jar thing? Dare I say that you're a legend for that, OP.", "I have three brothers, my mother tried to start a fart jar when we were kids.  My brothers and I just wrote iou's on sticky notes and put them in the jar.", "NTA. let me get this right. your sister wants you to apologise to a 1 year old. this is clownery", "NTA, your step sister is out of her mind! Telling you to watch your language, absolutely! But demanding you apologize to an actual baby is ridiculous and only speaks to her need to control everyone and everything. In fact it's probably not a huge loss if she doesn't want you to be hanging out with her kids!", "NTA, how else will they learn to swear properly?!", "You might roll this one out at r/maliciouscompliance . It's meant to be in that sub, like, foretold by prophecy kinda \"meant\".", "Child free aunt here and I gotta say your response was fucking epic\n\nNTA", "I come from a much smaller family.  The closest relative to me growing up was an Uncle that was 12 years older than me, and he cursed plenty as I was growing up.  I also had a parent in the military and grew up around other military families, so yeah.  This whole puritanical idea of inappropriate language traumatizing children is pure bullshit.  You're not cursing out the actual kids.  You're not even trying to get them to repeat you the way my uncle did when I was little.  As long as you don't actively try to \"corrupt the children\" and get them in trouble, you're NTA.\n\nIs this step-sis's first kid or just the youngest of her personal herd?  My opinion on her changes depending on the answer.  If it's the first, I'd roll my eyes but excuse the new mom drama.  If not, then she's just being a dramatic, controlling asshole and saw an excuse to be a buzzkill and bully you on your birthday.", "LOL.

Apologizing to him for swearing would kinda be like when we apologize to pets for stepping on them by accident, it's more for our own benefit because the words mean nothing to them. \n\nSwearing isn't going to harm the kid. They're just words. When we act like the words are taboo that's when they want to use them.", "NTA.  Fuck that apology. And fuck that jar.", "NTA.

Kids repeat stuff and it can cause problems with school, friends, etc.  \n\nYou think you are meeting your step-sister blow for blow, but you're actually acting like an asshole.  She cares about the language her child hears which as I already explained, is not totally unreasonable.  You don't care what her kid (or any kid) hears, you just don't like being told what to do.  You went on a swearing rampage to upset her rather than just recognizing her concern and trying to be more mindful.  That doesn't make you tough or smart, it makes you petty.  And as much as Reddit loves being petty, it isn't actually a great characteristic.  It is generally childish and/or alienating.\n\nYour step-sister isn't the one blowing things out of proportion, you are.  You are causing a big unnecessary drama rather than making an effort to curtail language that bothers a family member.  You made a much bigger fool out of yourself than you realize.", "NTA.

I curse like a sailor, every other word that comes out of me or my husbands mouths is fuck. My parents and grandparents are the same way. My two year old daughter and my 5 year old nephew may repeat one here and there, but we just tell them it\u2019s a grownup word and they move on.

One of the kids came up behind him, and he didn't notice, so there was no intention to swear in front of them.
