I'm still doing everything I can to find him because he hasn't been paying lately and I've been very busy anyway.\n\nI asked the girls asked what they wanted for christmas. my 11 yr olds wanted a nintendo switch with the latest pokemon game, and my 16 year old wants the ipad pro with the pencil .\n\nI do the best I can for my daughters but unfortunately, I have a limited budget and I told them this. I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can. At that point it seemed like we came to an understanding.\n\nMy intended budget for christmas shopping was $500, and since I could not afford the ipad she wanted, I got her a samsung tablet for $160 so I had to stretch it thin to make sure everyone gets presents.\n\nFast forward Christmas day and when the girls opened their gifts, the twins were happy to get their switch and 2 pokemon games. My oldest 16 threw a fit that it was not the ipad pro that she wanted. \n\nI told her that I could not afford a $800 tablet so I got her a very good brand tablet instead. She started yelling at me and calling me the worst mom ever and how she misses dad. I told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing that at this point that phone number is disconnected. I told her that she needs to understand that her father is not around anymore, and I have to take care of her and her sisters on my own and money is very scarce. I can only do so much. If this is the attitude I get for making sure she get something for christmas, I'll return the tablet. She's old enough to get a job anyway.\n\nMy daughter burst into tears and ran to her room. We have not spoke much since the incident.\n\nThe next day I returned the tablet to the store and that was the end of it.

Personally, I think that's just good parenting.\n\nBut throwing her dad\u2019s disinterest in her face like that? Oof. That's not okay, OP.", "I struggled to choose, but I\u2019m gonna say NAH **due to the background circumstances.** You are feeling the stress of being a single parent with limited time and an extremely limited income. Your daughter feels abandoned by one parent and most likely sees your business and stress as you pulling away from her emotionally as well. Someone was almost guaranteed to snap at some point.\n\nInstead of calling either of you an AH (and you honestly both had AH moments in this situation - 16 for how ungrateful she was when you\u2019d made it clear in advance you couldn\u2019t afford what she wanted and you for the crack about her calling her dad when you KNEW she couldn\u2019t) I just want to strongly advise you to seek professional counseling for your family.", "YTA, her whole life has changed, and she doesn't have the ability to handle it like an adult.  The only constant in her life is mom.  \n\nYou failed before Christmas.  You should have sat her down. told her that it is impossible to afford an $800 tablet.  And, then found (together) several possible things that she would be excited to get.  Saying... Extremely difficult leaves hope.  Alot of hope for a teenager who, up till Christmas morning, saw her mother as a single mom superhero. You set her up only to let her down.\n\nWhen she acts like a disappointed teenager who already sees life as completely unfair. You yell, lose your temper. And tell her tough shit. Your clue came in when she cried for a parent abandoned her. What she was saying is that she missed her life before the bomb went off. You should have hugged her , allowed her to cry, and agreed that it's not fair. \n\nUnless you fix this. She'll remember this Christmas as the year when she lost everything, including you.\n\nOut of curiosity,  how much responsibility does your teenager have when it comes to her siblings? Do you get everyone up dressed, fed, and out the door for the day? Are you there when they get home or meet them at the bus stop?  Are you there at dinner time and for homework?  Is your teen sharing this responsibility with you?", "YTA: An ipad pro and pencil implies that she wants to draw. Samsung tablets won't really work well for that and if she uses apple phones then EVERYTHING is different. It probably felt like you didn't know her at all and then her dad is gone and it hurts. That's a lot for a kid. Have you been talking to your daughter at all about this transition? You said, \"It must have been harder for.\" Like...you didn't ask her? You haven't been talking her through all of this? I think the Christmas present might be an Iranian yogurt situation here. Was it really about the tablet?", "YTA. So your budget was $500 and 120 was on two games and 200-300 was on the switch. \n\nInstead of sitting them down before Christmas and saying hey guys I love you but I can't afford that can we do something else you showed hard favoritism. Than you went and doubled down, returned it anyway so she really got nothing cause she's old enough to have a job? \n\nDid it really feel good to say any of that to your daughter?  Cause she's not gonna forget this or what you said to her.", "YTA. She had a bratty moment when she's disappointed. You got her sisters exactly what they wanted. Didn't get her want she asked for. Yall didn't have an understanding at all. She's lost her dad and you mock her with it? You're not sounding so grown up yourself.", "I don\u2019t know that anyone is the AH here except your ex. He put all of you in a horrible situation by not providing for your three children and making sure you and you alone carry the burden of being mom, dad, care giver, and sole provider. I agree with another comment- I think everyone should seek some kind of counseling or therapy. As for returning the gift, possibly the AH? Idk. I can\u2019t promise I wouldn\u2019t have returned the gift after I was spoken to that way. Yes, she\u2019s a \u201cchild\u201d but she\u2019s also 16 and needs to learn that she can\u2019t throw a temper tantrum and get what she wants. You don\u2019t have the funds. End of. Nothing more to discuss. Maybe offer her the money that you did spend on the tablet and tell her she is welcome to save her own money to buy the one she really wants. Mom ain\u2019t a cash cow and if she wants something, she can work/save for it. You and your daughter are *very softly* AH, but it\u2019s also understandable given the stress everyone is under and struggling to acclimate to a very different life style than was previously lived. \n\nBut you ex? Major AH.", "10000% YTA", "I think the sentence \"My ex husband is no longer around to spoil them like he usually does\" explains what's happening here. YT very strange A.", "OP I say this as a school counsellor, your daughter was acting like a brat. That\u2019s to be expected shes 16 her brain is still developing and she misses her dad and is acting out it happens. That said, what you said to her was fucking awful. As a parent you just rubbed salt in that wound. That\u2019s why I will say YTA. It\u2019s not about the gifts it\u2019s about how you reacted to your daughter. \n\nHonest question did you apologize to her for saying that?", "\" I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can. At that point it seemed like we came to an understanding.\"\n\nI'd beg to differ.", "YTA \u201cI told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing the number is disconnected\u201d the fk is that?  \n\nYour daughter is going thru some shit right now and your response is to antagonize her. That\u2019s just cold.", "YTA\n\nWas she being a bit of a brat? Yeah. But come on. She\u2019s 16. Her dad is AWOL. Her mom got her sisters exactly what they wanted for Christmas but didn\u2019t get her what she wanted. She definitely over reacted. \n\nBut your response wasn\u2019t to wait until things had calmed down to talk to your daughter, which would have been the mature and correct way to go. No, you decided to return it the *very next day*. You also, in some fucked up part of your brain, thought that telling your daughter whose father has abandoned her to call him if she misses him so much?? Great parenting.\n\nShe\u2019s clearly going through a lot. I get that your ex left you with a lot on your plate here but she\u2019s a teenager and her dad abandoned her. You definitely should have been more understanding. I\u2019m not saying you had to have gotten her an iPad but you seriously thought that returning her Christmas gift was the right move here? And why haven\u2019t you spoken to her about this yet? This happened over a month ago. \n\nAgain, I feel for you and the situation your ex left you in. But. Your daughter is *a child*. Who is is clearly acting out because her dad abandoned her.  What are you doing to help her through this? Is she therapy? Honestly you both sound like you need therapy, and your other kids would probably benefit from it as well.", "I'll be unpopular but YTA - she's going through some pretty terrible shit and you just made it worse. Go back to the store, repurchase the tablet and give it to her. Is it really worth her 'hating' you because your feelings were hurt?", "YTA your eldest is already going through a time of turbulent emotions because she was abandoned by a parent and you only made it worse by telling her to call him knowing the number didn\u2019t work. You are only reminding her of the abandonment. \n\nEmotional outbursts happen with kids, especially when her life essentially just got flipped upside down and she is used to a certain way of living.\n\nHonestly, I would\u2019ve been on the fence about this if it was just the tablet, but your comments about her father were so out of pocket and cruel to her that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re NTA anymore.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYour daughters behaviour was definitely out of line, but it definitely reads as a reaction to something far deeper. She weaponized her father, but if there wasn't already some form of trauma going on I highly doubt that it would have even come up. \n\nI think people forget here that teenagers are allowed to grieve the life they once had too. It's not as easy for an under-developed mind to just accept a change in parental and financial structure during a separation, particularly if they haven't been heavily exposed to it in younger years. Let alone a parent just totally cutting them off. There's some really deep and hurtful changes here going on, her outburst is relatively normal considering. \n\nThe returning of the tablet had me say YTA. I understand the disappointment in her reaction, but I couldn't imagine just returning an item gifted before actually communicating and getting to the bottom of the actual problem. \n\nYou had an opportunity to wait for the dust to settle, to sit with her and teach her some valuable life lessons around finances and temporary sacrifices. Hey, you could have even said we can work with this for now, but how about we set some goals to try and reach that Ipad Pro. \n\nI think that would have been a far better solution than just telling her to call her father and returning the gift imo.", "Info does he have court ordered support?", "You literally told your daughter, who was abandoned by her dad to call him knowing she can't? Wtf is wrong with you? How could you say such a cruel and heartbreaking thing to your child? You're the adult and you acted far worse than she did. Returning the gift was an extra cherry on top of your shit parenting sundae.\n\nYTA, and mother to mother, I know you know it.", "YTA she\u2019s a teenager who just lost her father. I get you are stressed but that was some terrible parenting right there. You need to make this up to her quick! Also realize, what she saw was her two little sisters getting exactly what they asked for when she didn\u2019t. Yes I understand the price difference but that had to hurt. You need to cut her some slack.", "YTA for your response.", "YTA. not because of the ipad, but for ignoring the obvious signs that she is suffering. as someone who's dad walked out, anger is a pretty common way for the grief to express itself. you had no understanding for your own daughter and i can only hope you learn from ur mistake and try to build ur relationship with her because if you react this way to every outburst she has (and there will probably be a lot because shes grieving) it will ruin ur relationship with her. she's 16, she will be 18 and moving out before you know it, fixing a relationship when she's independent and does not like you will be a lot harder than if she still lives with u.", "YTA im sorry it's hard. But it is hard for your daughter as well. She miss her father, it's the first Christmas without him. I can't imagine how abandoned yor children feel, knowing that their father don't want anything to do with them.  \n\nShe's a child who lost her father, and she is a child who likely have been growing a whole lot up the last year. \nI did when my parents divorced. \nAnd then on Christmas eve/day when she hoped to feel like a child, you gave her false hope. Seeing the siblings getting their wish, and opening a box looking like an Ipad, you should have known it would be a disappointment. \n\nAnd i don't say you should have given her an ipad, you could not afford. But you could have told her beforehand, or given her something else. \n\nShe is not TA for being disappointed or for acting out under the circumstances. \n\nYou on the other hand is TA for: \n1) Not understanding that your daughter is grevaing and need you to be an supportive adult. \n2) for telling her to grow up and get a job on Christmas.\n3)for lashing out on her, because she mentions her father. And rubbing salt in the cut, by mentioning how he abandoned his children.", "Soft YTA\n\nIt wasn't about the iPad. It was about losing her dad and possibly a huge chunk of her self-worth. \n\nWhat you said wasn't the best but returning the gift was rubbing salt in the wound. Sorry to say that as you're clearly doing the best you can for your girls.", "Yta - she's a kid whose dad just ran out on her. Her little sisters got exactly what they wanted PLUS more (an extra game). She *should* be punished but you should talk to her now.", "This is a tough one, but ESH.   \n\n\nHere's why: \n\nYour daughter shouldn't be ungrateful about a present she gets. A samsung tablet is still a really good brand, and you could come up with alternatives for her to earn it - she's old enough for a job, maybe you could go halfsies? Payment plans? Etc.  \n\n\nRevoking the gift was bad enough, but I understand. What really tipped you into AH territory for me was the fact that you told an obviously upset teenager to call her dad *knowing his phone number was disconnected*. Whether she knows her father's number is disconnected or not is irrelevant. You chose to make her a part of your drama with your ex-husband, and you decided to dig into the wound that's fresh for both of you - you lost your husband and coparent, she lost her *father*. That was heartless, and it doesn't seem like you ever apologized, and you are the parent here.  \n\n\nWe all have our moments, and I don't blame you for that, but you are the parent. Be the bigger person.", "ESH. Your daughter is definitely acting like an entitled brat, but that is likely the result of feeling abandoned by her father. You are going through severe stress, but you should not be putting your financial burdens on your children. I think therapy would benefit all of you", "YTA; i\u2019m sure you are trying your best and I don\u2019t blame you for not having the money for a very expensive present, but not only did you leave her hanging on till the last minute and then reacted with a lot of anger when she did not react like you wanted her to (please remember she\u2019s still a child) but you also bought your other children what they wanted. Then you take away the one  present  she got? I know you\u2019re dealing with a lot, but she just a kid who lost her a lot of who made her who she is. She wasn\u2019t acting like a complete  brat; she was acting like a child, who is angry, and upset. If you want her to have mature reactions; I would\u2019ve definitely tried sitting down with her and letting her know you know there\u2019s not enough money for this right now, but how about what else can the two of you do together.", "YTA. Yes your daughter had a meltdown. She has lost her dad and now has to deal with a lower standard of living because of the divorce she is grieving the loss of her dad, who has disappeared. Instead of dealing with her like an adult, you took away her only Christmas present the next day, rather than having a talk with her about what she wanted to do with it. She may have gotten over the disappointment and might have used the tablet. Instead, you just showed her that you do not give a damn about what she is going through. Her world was turned upside down and you took out your frustration with her father out on her. Did you even talk to her about what else she might have wanted since the tablet was out of your price range? I understand that you are in a difficult circumstance but you could have waited a few days before returning the tablet. And had a talk with your daughter.", "Ok, so on the specific question of were you the AH for returning the tablet, yes. But that's only because you didn't recognize her tantrum as a symptom of something deeper, not for simply returning the tablet. Also, that bit about getting a job doesn't help anything. Overall, I'd say NAH, just some hurt people who need to be pulling together rather than letting things split them apart. \n\nYou all need to have open and honest conversations about everything, even if it has been a year since the divorce finalized. Their dad abandoned them, you, this is not something that will just be gotten over. She does miss her father, but not because you're a bad mom. Ever heard the phrase \"Hurt people hurt people\"? That's what that was.\n\nAs soon as you two are home, find a way to talk to her, alone. If you're comfortable with leaving the twins alone for a hour, go buy her ice cream or whatever. Just set some mom and daughter time so you two can talk. This will strain your relationship and its better to cut the rot your ex introduced now before it festers.", "Soft YTA. Your child had an emotional outburst because she\u2019s a child and that\u2019s what they do. She just lost her dad and has likely still not reconciled her emotions regarding all of the break up. It\u2019s good that you explained you\u2019re doing the best you can but your telling her she\u2019s old enough to get a job then returning her present makes you the AH. You say that\u2019s the end of it but just because she isn\u2019t talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Sit down with her and ask her why she\u2019s so disappointed. I doubt it\u2019s just the tablet.", "Hard to say as it goes both ways. On the one hand, yes, it is a trying time for your teen with the separation and divorce. On the other, she needs to learn how to appriciate what she has been gifted as well as you doing everything you are to provide.\n\nHopefully you two will be able to have a calm discussion about everything to patch up the rift over this situation.", "NTA but she is old enough that you can tell her how much you can spend and ask her to pick something in that price range.", "NTA.\n\nhave you considered shopping for a used ipad on ebay..? that's how i bought my laptop. and i did it with paypal credit. it was the only way for me to afford what i wanted, when i wanted it.", "NTA! People can be ungrateful. I would have taken back as well. Reminds me of those YouTube videos people used to post showing kids having meltdowns because it wasn't the right model, a model older than the latest and greatest etc. Stand your ground op. She can be happy or she can go without. It's not a necessity one bit.", "NTA should you  have been more tactful? Yup. But there's correct and there's reacting in the moment, two different things. We've all been there, it's hard for teens to understand sometimes what they want and what's possible are two different things. I would have held off on returning the gift - once everything calms down she will probably want it. And I'm sure her father leaving like that has devastated all of them - you should start looking for him and drag his sorry ass to court. Maybe you can start looking into therapy for her, I'm sure she could use it. But no, you're not an asshole - you're a tired person doing her best.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I probably would've told her when she asked for the iPad that her gift costs more than her sisters' combined and to figure something more in budget. Assuming cheapest, you spent about $300 (no tax) for a Switch Lite and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for them to share. Meanwhile your oldest is wanting basically over five times the value for herself. Then when she gets something for Christmas, she decided to be ungrateful and basically made you feel like a worthless parent, even though you're doing everything in your ability to raise her and her siblings and still have something of a good Christmas.\n\nNow, your line of telling her to go ahead and call her father might have been a little much, but I'm a full believer of matching energies, and she threw the shade first. To be nice to you as a mother, I won't sit here and call her a b\\*\\*\\*\\*. However, it is what she's acting like and she honestly needs to get some counseling before things get too bad.", "I would say NTA, but could of been handled completely differently. \nSpeak to your children, you'll be amazed how understanding they are once your let them know what's going on (truth). \n\nI'm a single mom to a almost 7 yr old that I spoil when I have the chnace. My car went into the shop and just spent $500 on it. (We had planned to go get universal studios passes for his bday in 1 week) I've told him we wouldn't be able to make it, he asked why, I answered honestly. All he said was ok, if we can get pizza and watch movies with his cousins at home which are the new plans now. They're capable of understanding if you give them the chance.... \n(Ps. I always speak to my son about everything that includes a major change, or things that are going on since he was born even if he didn't understand I always talked to him).", "NTA for returning the Christmas present. She threw a fit over not receiving an expensive gift, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to return the gift you did get her. But, you are TA for telling her to call her dad knowing that she couldn\u2019t. That was a terrible thing to say. You are the adult here and it\u2019s your responsibility to lead your family through this difficult time.", "NTA for taking the tablet back, as the kiddos actions warranted that move.  A side note though, an ipad pro is a significantly better tablet than the one you were trying to give her and that one would not have been capable of much, those cheap tablets are just crap.", "NAH. You ex is a huge one though. \n\nThat said I think you messed up a little. If your daughter was dead set on an iPad I wouldn\u2019t have just assumed she would just be okay with a Samsung tablet. I think at 16, you could have sat her down and had a one on one conversation and explained what you could afford and if she maybe wanted something different. Your daughter is clearly struggling to adjust as she was used to a certain financial standard of living and of course your ex just abandoning her.", "Ok so at first I was thinking NTA but I had to change my mind. Considering everything your going through it must be difficult but it\u2019s also difficult for your daughter as well. Yes you lost you husband but she lost the man that raised her, her father. She also had to see that your twins got exactly what they wanted and she might have been more emotional because of it. Additionally not to blame you at all but there was mention of you working more hours so that probably took you away from the home more than she is used to. Children do not always know the right way to express their emotions and can lash out at the wrong people. Even as an adult we can do or say things that can be petty/ childish. I.e. telling your daughter to call he dad when you knew his phone was disconnected. I say either get the tablet back or work out with her a different gift that you may be able to afford. If possible schedule her a meeting with a counselor to start working through the extra emotions. Overall good luck mom. Stay strong for the kiddos and I wish you the best !", "NTA, you both could have handled it better and been more thoughtful on what the other is going through.  The truth is that your daughter needs to learn that money is tight and it\u2019s not going back to the way it was.  Going forward it would be a good idea to give her a price range for Christmas and birthday gifts, eating out, clothes etc.  Be truthful and non-judge mental about their father, they need to know your not getting child support, that he cut off the phone.  If you do get child support again be honest with how much and where it\u2019s going.", "NTA. Your daughter is dealing with a lot and it's understandable that she is struggling with her emotions and the absence of her father. It's commendable that you did your best to provide for her and her sisters, but the situation with money can be tough and it's okay to have limits. However, it's also important to have an open and understanding conversation with your daughter about your financial situation and to try to find a solution together.", "NTA and bring on the downvotes. If the tablet would not be used, returning it was the right move. Budget is tight. Why let it sit unused? \n\nOP is abandoned financially and dealing with it. Good for her. It is only human to be hurt by a little snot-nose who digs at her by saying essentially that if dad was here she\u2019d have the tablet she aspired to. It might be true! Two incomes before the split. But that\u2019s not reality. \n\nOP, put aside the tablet money. Talk with 16 and offer it if she wants to earn the difference for the desired tablet. Reassure her that you understand what she wants, but it can\u2019t happen. Dad has bugged out. It impacts the family left behind.", "NTA. She should have been grateful for what she got and clearly wasn\u2019t. You did the best you could with what you had, balancing it out amongst all 3 kids. \n\nAnd, yes, if she is particular about getting that iPad pro, she can get a job and buy it herself.", "NTA. If she's going to whine about not getting what she wants, she gets nothing at all. 16 is WAY too old to throw tantrums about Christmas presents. All these YTA comments defending her baffles me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The divorce finalized exactly 1 year ago, since then he changed his number and has not even bothered to call our daughters and I as a nurse working long hours are doing my best to provide for 3 girls. I'm still doing everything I can to find him because he hasn't been paying lately and I've been very busy anyway.\n\nI asked the girls asked what they wanted for christmas. my 11 yr olds wanted a nintendo switch with the latest pokemon game, and my 16 year old wants the ipad pro with the pencil .\n\nI do the best I can for my daughters but unfortunately, I have a limited budget and I told them this. I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can. At that point it seemed like we came to an understanding.\n\nMy intended budget for christmas shopping was $500, and since I could not afford the ipad she wanted, I got her a samsung tablet for $160 so I had to stretch it thin to make sure everyone gets presents.\n\nFast forward Christmas day and when the girls opened their gifts, the twins were happy to get their switch and 2 pokemon games. My oldest 16 threw a fit that it was not the ipad pro that she wanted. \n\nI told her that I could not afford a $800 tablet so I got her a very good brand tablet instead. She started yelling at me and calling me the worst mom ever and how she misses dad. I told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing that at this point that phone number is disconnected. I told her that she needs to understand that her father is not around anymore, and I have to take care of her and her sisters on my own and money is very scarce. I can only do so much. If this is the attitude I get for making sure she get something for christmas, I'll return the tablet. She's old enough to get a job anyway.\n\nMy daughter burst into tears and ran to her room. We have not spoke much since the incident.\n\nThe next day I returned the tablet to the store and that was the end of it. Despite my oldest acting like a complete spoiled brat on Christmas, I felt like I should have been more understanding of her situation as her father and I recently divorced and it must have been harder for her and her sisters, especially since dad disappeared.\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, this is hard on everyone but your daughter is being a brat.", "YTA, you said you have 500 for gifts, a brand new switch plus two pokemon games (not the one the twins asked for) is with tax about 400 dollars. That left 100 dollars to spend on your other daughter, while its clear you spent 200 dollars on each of your twins.  OP is playing favorites.", "NTA but you should give her the money and tell her if she gets a job she can afford the iPad within a month or 2", "YTA. Apologize for the cruel remark, give her the cash amount you would've spent, and have an honest conversation with her.", "NTA.  She's trying to guilt you into giving her whatever she wants.  I would suggest sitting down with her and explaining the concept of a budget.  She's old enough to understand that circumstances have changed and that it probably had much more to do with your former spouse than with you (after all, he's walked away from his responsibilities, you haven't).  Put aside the $160 you spent on the tablet that was returned.  Put tell her you'll add some money to that for her birthday.  Explain that you are willing to help her get a part-time job so she can off-set the difference between what she wants and what you can afford.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like your ex is making his support payments.  Go after him for the money, hard and fast.  If he has any sort of professional license, most states will yank it until he is current with his child support.  Once his standard of living is negatively impacted, he will pay up.  Don't feel guilty about doing it.  He doesn't owe that money to you, he owes it to his kids.  Some of that money could also have helped off-set the cost of the iPad tablet his daughter wants.", "You're right. You should have been more understanding. Your children are struggling with your divorce just as much as you are. Probably more. You may be missing out on child support, but their father abandoned them. Of course there will be negative reactions. Of course they will act like brats. You got your youngest 2 exactly what they wanted, and used the leftover to get something for your eldest. But while they got what they wanted, she did not. \n\n>I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can.\n\nYou gave her hope knowing you couldn't afford it, and just assumed she'd be fine with a surprise disappointment. And you returned the gift you did buy because of her ingratitude, and then you told her to get a job so she can support herself? That's one way to parent, I guess. YTA.", "You know that this isn't about the tablet on either of your sides. She's missing her dad and she's old enough to truly understand that he fully abandoned her, but she's also not able to deal with that so she let's the bad feelings out on safe people (you) about topics that let her give physical form to the mass of rage and sorrow inside her (the tablet)\n\nAnd it's not about the tablet for you either. Its about the pain from the relationship and the difficulty of trying to hold the family together. \n\nAnd you dealt with your pain by ripping open your daughter's wound. Yes, YTA", "YTA. You are her mother. Rubbing the fact that her father abandoned her in the face of a child is viscous. I get that her response is ungrateful and upsetting especially with how hard you have to work to provide, but seriously, that level of petty cruelty was not warranted as a response. She\u2019s a CHILD, struggling and expressing emotion in the face of having one parent walk out of her life and feeling she is the unfavored older kid by her remaining caregiver, something this experience probably reinforced. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to grant some leniency and understanding, throwing her abandonment at her as a retort and returning her gift the very next day is kind of going nuclear. She needs support - why haven\u2019t you talked or tried to resolve things with your child in over a month? I hope you can try to see her with more gentleness and have some empathy for her situation, being a teenager is extremely hard and isolating even without the terrible circumstances this girl is going through.", "YTA for throwing her father abandoning in her face. Was her behavior okay? Not really, but that response is massively inappropriate. It\u2019s only going to exacerbate the problems she\u2019s having that you said all of that to her. \n\nReturning the tablet is fine, because honestly you probably shouldn\u2019t have bought it in the first place. You should have asked her what she would like that wasn\u2019t an iPad Pro but still within your budget. Your twins got exactly what they wanted (and an additional game!). You should have found another item she wanted so you could get her exactly what she wanted as well. It also would have helped her adjust expectations. It seems you lead her to believe you would do what you could to get her the iPad then just assumed you were on the same page. Making it clear she wouldn\u2019t get it so she should pick something else would have avoided this situation entirely. I get you were trying to do right by her and get her a tablet within your budget, but you shouldn\u2019t have let her expect something it would have been impossible for you to get.", "YTA for the way you responded.  She hurt you, so you hurt right back and returned the present.  Be a grown up.", "ESH but gently. You're going through so much on your own and shouldering a ton and she's trying to process this huge change too. It's bound to create disagreements.\n\nComing back at her that she should call her Dad knowing full well he's no longer interested in being a father -- that's cold.\n\nYour daughter is struggling but she's also acting like a brat.\n\nThere's a tough journey of communication ahead for you both. I don't think taking away her gift makes you an A H, but playing with her feelings w/ that comment about her father does.", "YTA and I'm not surprised someone divorced you if your go-to in arguments is be emotionally abusive. Disgusting behaviour.  \nYour daughter didn't need to react that way but the difference between her and you is you're supposed to be the *adult* and you acted like a high-school bully by saying what you did. you didn't say it punish her for her behaviour. You did it purely to break her heart and hurt her. No loving parent throws that type of stuff in their child's face over that kind of reaction to being disappointed on Christmas.", "YTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your circumstances and I hate that I have to calm you the AH. You\u2019re ex is an absolute prick of misery and has put you in a horrible position. Your daughter is old enough to understand, but she\u2019s not mature enough to be able to handle her feelings. Her dad left. Her way of life is over. And you are her safe space. You are the one she\u2019s going to take everything out on. It\u2019s not fair to you, but it\u2019s the way it is. She will grow up and she will understand and she will feel remorseful for the way she acted. You just have to hang in there mom. My heart breaks for all four of you.", "YTA. \"I told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing that at this point that phone number is disconnected.\" If in not too distant future, your eldest no longer wants anything to do with you, I hope these words ring in your ears. That's a pathetic thing for anyone to say to a 16 year old, much less their own mother.\n\nThe whole issue is down to your poor communication. You hadn't been clear to her, in your mind you thought you had been, but really you should have sat her down and explained things properly.\n\nThere's also the issue with immediately returning the tablet the next day. Again your communication is just bad. You made no attempt to speak to her? She is your daughter you know, not a stranger.\n\nWas the tablet going to be used for art? The pencil she asked for would suggest this, was the alternative one you bought suitable for this? If it wasn't then I can really understand her disappointment watching her two siblings get exactly what they asked for..\n\nHonestly the worst thing is that you admit to not once considering her feelings about her family just getting ripped apart, I just do not understand how you managed to do that.", "You know this wasn't about the tablet, right? She's angry and upset and the tablet became a way to express that.\n\nYTA \n\nYou need to have a bit of patience with your daughter because it's perfectly reasonable that she's going through a rough time. While you don't have to necessarily tolerate her outbursts, returning the gift was actually a step too far in context to what's happening.", "YTA. This is hard, of course she misses her dad and the life she had before. It\u2019s not unusual for a teenager of any background to overreact to not getting what they expected and get a \u201clower\u201d gift. She more than likely would have realized what a great gift it was given time but you didn\u2019t give her any. She\u2019s a teenager going through a lot; she will one way day realize what you went through to provide but she\u2019s not there yet. This behavior will only make her resent you. You are raising kids\u2026. treat them as such", "Nah. You're both going through some shit. I pulled that line with my mama too and my dad was a deadbeat. \n\nI think the 16 yo is old enough for a discussion about finances. Nothing about struggling but letting her know about going from 2 incomes to 1 and what all budgeting entails. These are things she needs to know how to do anyways.", "NTA. She\u2019s 16. She\u2019s actually old enough to get a part time job and start understanding that money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. I had a single mother. I understood her struggle and was grateful for everything she did. So this behaviour makes my blood boil. It\u2019s disrespectful and she needs a reality check. She can miss her dad all she wants, but he doesn\u2019t care about her or her sisters. She\u2019s putting a deadbeat on a pedestal.", "YTA.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Yes your kid was acting spoiled. She\u2019s also very obviously going through some shit that you likely haven\u2019t noticed because you\u2019re so busy trying to provide.\n\nYou\u2019re STILL the adult in the situation and what you said wasn\u2019t appropriate or okay and will only add to whatever she is going through. It\u2019s stressful I get it, and you should have space to appropriately express your frustrations, but lashing out at your child because your child has lashed out at you doesn\u2019t help anyone. \n\nBe the adult in the situation. Figure out what\u2019s actually going on with her and for the love of god do not rub in her face that her father has abandoned her.", "NAH (except for the dad) - everyone is in pain. The only thing you shouldn't have done was say \"I'll do what I can\", because that's a yes to a kid.\n\nAt 16 can she get a part time job to pay for an ipad? You could hang on to the $160 from the tablet to use towards the ipad if that is what she really wants to have. \n\nDo you have a support order filed against dead-beat dad?", "Soft YTA.\n\nIn the words of Bobby Singer: \u201cKids ain't supposed to be grateful. They're supposed to eat your food and break your heart.\u201d \n\nWas her reaction out of line? Sure, that can be argued. Are you going though a tough time? Absolutely. However, it wasn\u2019t just your husband that left you, her father abandoned her and /changed his number/. Something you wasted no time pointing out. \n\nHer siblings got exactly what they asked for. The older kids get, the more expensive theirs asks tend to be. Would you have returned the item and said what you said to her siblings if you reversed the situation and planned their gift around what you could afford after buying the iPad? If you feel your children need a reality check going forward without their dad, then they all need said reality check, not just the oldest by virtue of simply being the oldest. If your plan is just to short straw your oldest because you think they should be more situationally understanding, you\u2019re on a direct road to NC.\n\nIf your argument is that she\u2019s older and closer to legal adulthood and therefore should have a more \u2018mature\u2019 response (according to your standards), what is your excuse for your incredibly immature response to her?", "So instead of everyone getting their fair share you got your girls almost 400$ worth and yoir daughter one thing? YTA.", "You're not be an asshole but it sounds like you raised one.", "NTA", "AH moments is a nice way of putting it. It's a rough situation to be in, neither of them should be flailing accusations to each other. Especially not on Christmas day. The daughter should understand that mom is doing a lot of work just so she can provide for the kids and mom should understand that kids might have a difficult time adjusting to a dadless Christmas. And also a bit of added jealousy with the oldest daughter as the other kids did get the exact present they wanted.", "Absolutely everything you said here. Her behavior while inappropriate was understandable and frankly it was on OP to be clearer when she knew the gift was a hard no and the kid\u2019s old enough to understand money. \n\nThe throwing Dad in her face is just YIKES. She\u2019ll never forget that.", "I agree with this.  I would have returned the tablet too. Was OP harsh in what she said about the Dad?  Yes but\u2026..that\u2019s the reality, and a 16 year old is old enough to hear the truth IMO.", "Ipad air are half the price of pro and virtually work the same", "Agree. OP absolutely could and should have been clearer and 16 is old enough to understand that it wasn\u2019t possible\u2026 and OP knew from jump she couldn\u2019t do it. (Not that she should have, just handled it differently.)\n\nGoing nuclear and telling her to call the Dad that abandoned her AND returning her gift? Too far. You\u2019re the adult here. Yes, teenager was acting terribly. BUT, I think she was set up for failure.", "she's 16 and is fully aware Dad left them by choice. Using the \"I hate you and miss Dad\" because she didn't get a gift almost three times as expensive as the other two's combined is completely inexcusable and uncalled for, especially as she is fully aware Mom woukd struggle to pay for it, and that Mom is as much as a victim of the divorce and abandonment as she is. The little brat very much deserved that reality check of \"well you might miss Dad but Dad clearly doesn't miss you, so watch your tongue\"", "Don't fall for that bait. She's pissed because she didn't get an ipad pro, period. If she had gotten it, dad's name would have never come up. She's being spoiled and tried to use her father as a weapon.", "Yeah I'm confused about all the N T A. Yes this mom is now a single mom to three kids. But this girls siblings got exactly what they wanted and when the 16 year old pointed out how unfair that is, the moms response is basically \"go cry to your dad...oh wait you cant cuz he abandoned you\". Real good parenting there.\n\nGirl definitely threw a temper tantrum but what child wouldnt when what shes looking at seems like clear favoritism? Imma say ESH. Girl for throwing the temper tantrum and mom for just being so cruel to a clearly struggling child.", "Don\u2019t forget she also returned the present so her daughter got nothing for Christmas.That\u2019s cold.", "No, it was about the iPad  if she had gotten it, dad would have never been brought up.", "But the twins' switch and games are shared between the two of them, so when you factor that in OP spent the same amount on e as ch of them.", "She doesn't have money (or time) for that", "I'm going to be honest. My first thought was to get a refurbished ipad, or maybe one that's not a pro. I am a Samsung person and I love my Samsung phone. I bought a Samsung tablet, and you know what? It's terrible.  It was a whole lot cheaper than an ipad, but you get what you pay for. It's kind of like asking for an Apple Watch and then getting a fitbit.  And it would be one thing if her sisters had not gotten exactly what they wanted.", "Yeah, the situation was bad and both acted like jerks, but it felt unfair to put E S H when it seems like this was coming from a year of repressed grief and stress on both sides.", "Certified refurbished. The 2018 iPad Pro can be found cheaper than a new base iPad and is arguably just as good because of the pro features (the stuff added in later models isn\u2019t that special.)", "They are still more than $160.", "The iPad argument aside (that's a dumb tantrum that should unequivocally be punished), yes, the teenager *was* out of line for using her father to attack her mother like that. \n\nBut she's a *teenager*.\n\nWhen mum fought back with the fact that dad doesn't care about the daughter anymore? That's a fully grown adult attacking a child with *very* painful topic.\n\nI'm not saying one action is *necessarily* worse than the other, but I am saying that a teenager being nasty is a learning curve, and an adult should know how to rise above and *be better.*", "She\u2019s 16 and struggling. She\u2019s not a brat. She needs therapy, love, and compassion.", "Spoiled? Nah. She\u2019s grieving, and was just abandoned by her father. She needs compassion and understanding.\n\nTeenagers have outbursts. It\u2019s what they do. They\u2019re having hormone fluctuations and are still learning effective ways to cope.

This was just cruel.", "it's her first christmas without her father and she's grieving, for teenagers grief from a parent walking out is very commonly expressed in anger", "My son wanted a gaming PC since he's 12. He kept all his money for three years, then studied on YouTube then ordered part everywhere and built it. And i raised him alone, i had no money and his dad went nc. He had his dream pc at 15. He managed to get a school fund, thanks to good grade, that i gave him, to double his money. \nShe's 16 she could have ask for money and planned to get one long term. Made some baby sitting, get a repacked one. OP set the money aside and tell her to plan long term. It's a good life lesson.. my son decided not to go out, have fancy clothes, just the bare minimum but he got what he wanted in the end.", "Good point. INFO: OP, did your 16yo get anything? Or did you just return her gift?", "she was abandoned by her dad and this was the first christmas without him, it was hard for her have some sympathy", "100, totally forgot about that option", "If we\u2019re going to give the teenager some leeway for being a teenager, we should also give the newly divorced single mom now providing for three children some grace too. Imo mom gave daughter the lay of the land, which may have hurt to hear, but daughter\u2019s hurtful words were because she didn\u2019t get an iPad Pro.", "OP also help set the kid up for disappointment. That iPad was never in the budget. She is 16. Tell her up front that the Xmas budget is $X per child and ask her what are some ideas she'd like in that budget.\n\n\nChild then has clear expectations and knows *for sure* that she isn't getting an $800 iPad and pencil (which is more). I'm sure she was hoping against hope for that iPad where as Mom thought she wouldn't expect it. \n\n\nThere is nothing shameful about a reasonable gift budget. OP's child is going through a lot and helping her with expectations and lowering disappointment would have been a good move.", "Both can definitely be true.\n\nStruggling And a brat.", "you are correct. she is 16 and struggling, but she is also a brat. the two are not mutually exclusive, and her choice of words and the nature of the gift very much implies this little outburst wasn't about Dad at all, he was just the sharpest emotional knife the kid had to take a swing at her mom.", "I mean my parents were cats and dogs, and dad could have been named Houdini for how often he vanished. I was 6-14, he was out of the picture, mom was on disability and got cancer. \n\nI did the grocery shopping for a week on a $20 budget in the 2000s. Was I perfect? Of course not, I was falling apart mentally and hella burnt out! \n\nSure she's a teenager, but they're smart enough to understand 'that's too expensive'. Hell, my 6yo understand this concept. If my mom had been working an RNs hours for our money, I'd never have dreamed of wasting money on something so frivolous.\n\nSure she's going thru stuff, but rn she is acting spoiled. Being in pain, emotional or otherwise, doesn't give you a pad to hurt others.", "I'm surprised people aren't talking abt the price discrepancy between the younger daughters and the teen's gifts. A switch is easily $400 without any insurance on it as well as between $30-60 dollars for individual games. Even if it was one switch between two children the mom easily spent more than $200 hundred on each of the younger ones. That teen is suffering and feels so unloved and her mother shoved that in her face.", "If she said I miss my dad that would be one thing. She lashed out because she didn't get her $800 iPad she could brag to her friends and ke ke about with it. She had to \"settle\" for something less than in her eyes. As I said if she would have gotten that iPad, no issue whatsoever.", "If this was a newly divorced single mom snapping at a peer - like a friend, sibling, or parent - sure.

Her mom doesn't get a pass for telling her kid that dadddy doesn't love her anymore.", "Ooh, you make a really logical point! Well said.\n\nDo I think a mum in her situation lashing out in an argument is human? Absolutely.\n\nDo I also think that a hurting teenager being mean to her mum is much less impactful than a mum reminding her daughter that her dad doesn't care about her for the sake of fighting fire with fire? Also, yes.\n\nWhy? Because one is an irrational, grieving child having a tantrum. The other is a mother. A struggling mother, *yes*; but still a mother.\n\nMaybe it's illogical of me to put so much more responsibility on OP? You really do make an excellent point. But I really can't shake my brain's insistence that the mother, in the situation, has a greater duty to *protect,* and therefore OP's attack was far more impactful than her daughter's.", "Exactly. \u201cDaughter I only have this much to spend , what do you want that is this much\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d when she knew it wasn\u2019t in the cards.

So about 180-200 per child. That's pretty equitable to the tablet purchased", "you have a very narrow way of thinking, teenagers are hormonal to begin with but when their father abandons them the grief usually comes out with anger and irritability. she isn't the asshole because she didn't get her daughter an ipad she's an asshole because of how she responded to a teenage girl who's dealing with a lot internally. telling her that if she misses her dad so much to call him AND GIVING HER AN OUT OF LINE NUMBER is not okay", "OP wasn\u2019t taking it out on daughter. She told her the facts (dad\u2019s gone, money is scarce), which were all perfectly good reasons for why OP can\u2019t afford the iPad Pro daughter was throwing a fit over.

The mom still spent more on the younger daughters and then proceeded to return the oldest daughter gift so she definitely ended up spending more on the little ones~", "I never mentioned anything with regards to mom saying go ahead and call him. I said she was upset about not getting the most cool gadget.", "an ipad is not the \"most cool gadget\" you seem quite out of touch with todays teenagers if you think that. she probably wasn't even upset about the ipad itself, and rather was already angry at her family, was bottling it up and this small thing that normally wouldn't make her *this* angry set her off. not that it makes her outburst or the things she said okay, but maybe instead of rubbing the fact that her dad abandoned her and won't pick up the phone, or posting about it on reddit, she could enroll her daughter into therapy so she doesn't bottle up her anger and let it out in a fit and can work through it and learn coping strategies. family therapy would be a good option too but i think she should also have private therapy. i genuinely doubt this was about the ipad. teenagers are not as simple as adults are, they're bad at communicating their true emotions because they aren't fully developed. if she was mad about the ipad she would yell about the ipad, but instead she started yelling about how she hates her mom and misses her dad. seems like a classic case of the cork on the bottled up anger popping off"]}
