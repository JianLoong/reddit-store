I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can. At that point it seemed like we came to an understanding.\n\nMy intended budget for christmas shopping was $500, and since I could not afford the ipad she wanted, I got her a samsung tablet for $160 so I had to stretch it thin to make sure everyone gets presents.\n\nFast forward Christmas day and when the girls opened their gifts, the twins were happy to get their switch and 2 pokemon games. My oldest 16 threw a fit that it was not the ipad pro that she wanted. \n\nI told her that I could not afford a $800 tablet so I got her a very good brand tablet instead. She started yelling at me and calling me the worst mom ever and how she misses dad. I told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing that at this point that phone number is disconnected. I told her that she needs to understand that her father is not around anymore, and I have to take care of her and her sisters on my own and money is very scarce. I can only do so much. If this is the attitude I get for making sure she get something for christmas, I'll return the tablet. She's old enough to get a job anyway.\n\nMy daughter burst into tears and ran to her room.

Personally, I think that's just good parenting.\n\nBut throwing her dad\u2019s disinterest in her face like that? Oof. That's not okay, OP.", "I struggled to choose, but I\u2019m gonna say NAH **due to the background circumstances.** You are feeling the stress of being a single parent with limited time and an extremely limited income. Your daughter feels abandoned by one parent and most likely sees your business and stress as you pulling away from her emotionally as well. Someone was almost guaranteed to snap at some point.\n\nInstead of calling either of you an AH (and you honestly both had AH moments in this situation - 16 for how ungrateful she was when you\u2019d made it clear in advance you couldn\u2019t afford what she wanted and you for the crack about her calling her dad when you KNEW she couldn\u2019t) I just want to strongly advise you to seek professional counseling for your family.", "YTA, her whole life has changed, and she doesn't have the ability to handle it like an adult.  The only constant in her life is mom.  \n\nYou failed before Christmas.  You should have sat her down. told her that it is impossible to afford an $800 tablet.  And, then found (together) several possible things that she would be excited to get.  Saying... Extremely difficult leaves hope.  Alot of hope for a teenager who, up till Christmas morning, saw her mother as a single mom superhero. You set her up only to let her down.\n\nWhen she acts like a disappointed teenager who already sees life as completely unfair. You yell, lose your temper. And tell her tough shit. Your clue came in when she cried for a parent abandoned her. What she was saying is that she missed her life before the bomb went off. You should have hugged her , allowed her to cry, and agreed that it's not fair. \n\nUnless you fix this. She'll remember this Christmas as the year when she lost everything, including you.\n\nOut of curiosity,  how much responsibility does your teenager have when it comes to her siblings? Do you get everyone up dressed, fed, and out the door for the day? Are you there when they get home or meet them at the bus stop?  Are you there at dinner time and for homework?  Is your teen sharing this responsibility with you?", "YTA: An ipad pro and pencil implies that she wants to draw. Samsung tablets won't really work well for that and if she uses apple phones then EVERYTHING is different. It probably felt like you didn't know her at all and then her dad is gone and it hurts. That's a lot for a kid. Have you been talking to your daughter at all about this transition? You said, \"It must have been harder for.\" Like...you didn't ask her? You haven't been talking her through all of this? I think the Christmas present might be an Iranian yogurt situation here. Was it really about the tablet?", "YTA. So your budget was $500 and 120 was on two games and 200-300 was on the switch. \n\nInstead of sitting them down before Christmas and saying hey guys I love you but I can't afford that can we do something else you showed hard favoritism. Than you went and doubled down, returned it anyway so she really got nothing cause she's old enough to have a job? \n\nDid it really feel good to say any of that to your daughter?  Cause she's not gonna forget this or what you said to her.", "YTA. She had a bratty moment when she's disappointed. You got her sisters exactly what they wanted. Didn't get her want she asked for. Yall didn't have an understanding at all. She's lost her dad and you mock her with it? You're not sounding so grown up yourself.", "I don\u2019t know that anyone is the AH here except your ex. He put all of you in a horrible situation by not providing for your three children and making sure you and you alone carry the burden of being mom, dad, care giver, and sole provider. I agree with another comment- I think everyone should seek some kind of counseling or therapy. As for returning the gift, possibly the AH? Idk. I can\u2019t promise I wouldn\u2019t have returned the gift after I was spoken to that way. Yes, she\u2019s a \u201cchild\u201d but she\u2019s also 16 and needs to learn that she can\u2019t throw a temper tantrum and get what she wants. You don\u2019t have the funds. End of. Nothing more to discuss. Maybe offer her the money that you did spend on the tablet and tell her she is welcome to save her own money to buy the one she really wants. Mom ain\u2019t a cash cow and if she wants something, she can work/save for it. You and your daughter are *very softly* AH, but it\u2019s also understandable given the stress everyone is under and struggling to acclimate to a very different life style than was previously lived. \n\nBut you ex? Major AH.", "10000% YTA", "I think the sentence \"My ex husband is no longer around to spoil them like he usually does\" explains what's happening here. YT very strange A.", "OP I say this as a school counsellor, your daughter was acting like a brat. That\u2019s to be expected shes 16 her brain is still developing and she misses her dad and is acting out it happens. That said, what you said to her was fucking awful. As a parent you just rubbed salt in that wound. That\u2019s why I will say YTA. It\u2019s not about the gifts it\u2019s about how you reacted to your daughter. \n\nHonest question did you apologize to her for saying that?", "\" I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can. At that point it seemed like we came to an understanding.\"\n\nI'd beg to differ.", "YTA \u201cI told her that if she misses her father so much, call him, knowing the number is disconnected\u201d the fk is that?  \n\nYour daughter is going thru some shit right now and your response is to antagonize her. That\u2019s just cold.", "YTA\n\nWas she being a bit of a brat? Yeah. But come on. She\u2019s 16. Her dad is AWOL. Her mom got her sisters exactly what they wanted for Christmas but didn\u2019t get her what she wanted. She definitely over reacted. \n\nBut your response wasn\u2019t to wait until things had calmed down to talk to your daughter, which would have been the mature and correct way to go. No, you decided to return it the *very next day*. You also, in some fucked up part of your brain, thought that telling your daughter whose father has abandoned her to call him if she misses him so much?? Great parenting.\n\nShe\u2019s clearly going through a lot. I get that your ex left you with a lot on your plate here but she\u2019s a teenager and her dad abandoned her. You definitely should have been more understanding. I\u2019m not saying you had to have gotten her an iPad but you seriously thought that returning her Christmas gift was the right move here? And why haven\u2019t you spoken to her about this yet? This happened over a month ago. \n\nAgain, I feel for you and the situation your ex left you in. But. Your daughter is *a child*. Who is is clearly acting out because her dad abandoned her.  What are you doing to help her through this? Is she therapy? Honestly you both sound like you need therapy, and your other kids would probably benefit from it as well.", "I'll be unpopular but YTA - she's going through some pretty terrible shit and you just made it worse. Go back to the store, repurchase the tablet and give it to her. Is it really worth her 'hating' you because your feelings were hurt?", "YTA your eldest is already going through a time of turbulent emotions because she was abandoned by a parent and you only made it worse by telling her to call him knowing the number didn\u2019t work. You are only reminding her of the abandonment. \n\nEmotional outbursts happen with kids, especially when her life essentially just got flipped upside down and she is used to a certain way of living.\n\nHonestly, I would\u2019ve been on the fence about this if it was just the tablet, but your comments about her father were so out of pocket and cruel to her that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re NTA anymore.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYour daughters behaviour was definitely out of line, but it definitely reads as a reaction to something far deeper. She weaponized her father, but if there wasn't already some form of trauma going on I highly doubt that it would have even come up. \n\nI think people forget here that teenagers are allowed to grieve the life they once had too. It's not as easy for an under-developed mind to just accept a change in parental and financial structure during a separation, particularly if they haven't been heavily exposed to it in younger years. Let alone a parent just totally cutting them off. There's some really deep and hurtful changes here going on, her outburst is relatively normal considering. \n\nThe returning of the tablet had me say YTA. I understand the disappointment in her reaction, but I couldn't imagine just returning an item gifted before actually communicating and getting to the bottom of the actual problem. \n\nYou had an opportunity to wait for the dust to settle, to sit with her and teach her some valuable life lessons around finances and temporary sacrifices. Hey, you could have even said we can work with this for now, but how about we set some goals to try and reach that Ipad Pro. \n\nI think that would have been a far better solution than just telling her to call her father and returning the gift imo.", "Info does he have court ordered support?", "You literally told your daughter, who was abandoned by her dad to call him knowing she can't? Wtf is wrong with you? How could you say such a cruel and heartbreaking thing to your child? You're the adult and you acted far worse than she did. Returning the gift was an extra cherry on top of your shit parenting sundae.\n\nYTA, and mother to mother, I know you know it.", "YTA she\u2019s a teenager who just lost her father. I get you are stressed but that was some terrible parenting right there. You need to make this up to her quick! Also realize, what she saw was her two little sisters getting exactly what they asked for when she didn\u2019t. Yes I understand the price difference but that had to hurt. You need to cut her some slack.", "YTA for your response.", "YTA. not because of the ipad, but for ignoring the obvious signs that she is suffering. as someone who's dad walked out, anger is a pretty common way for the grief to express itself. you had no understanding for your own daughter and i can only hope you learn from ur mistake and try to build ur relationship with her because if you react this way to every outburst she has (and there will probably be a lot because shes grieving) it will ruin ur relationship with her. she's 16, she will be 18 and moving out before you know it, fixing a relationship when she's independent and does not like you will be a lot harder than if she still lives with u.", "YTA im sorry it's hard. But it is hard for your daughter as well. She miss her father, it's the first Christmas without him. I can't imagine how abandoned yor children feel, knowing that their father don't want anything to do with them.  \n\nShe's a child who lost her father, and she is a child who likely have been growing a whole lot up the last year. \nI did when my parents divorced. \nAnd then on Christmas eve/day when she hoped to feel like a child, you gave her false hope. Seeing the siblings getting their wish, and opening a box looking like an Ipad, you should have known it would be a disappointment. \n\nAnd i don't say you should have given her an ipad, you could not afford. But you could have told her beforehand, or given her something else. \n\nShe is not TA for being disappointed or for acting out under the circumstances. \n\nYou on the other hand is TA for: \n1) Not understanding that your daughter is grevaing and need you to be an supportive adult. \n2) for telling her to grow up and get a job on Christmas.\n3)for lashing out on her, because she mentions her father. And rubbing salt in the cut, by mentioning how he abandoned his children.", "Soft YTA\n\nIt wasn't about the iPad. It was about losing her dad and possibly a huge chunk of her self-worth. \n\nWhat you said wasn't the best but returning the gift was rubbing salt in the wound. Sorry to say that as you're clearly doing the best you can for your girls.", "Yta - she's a kid whose dad just ran out on her. Her little sisters got exactly what they wanted PLUS more (an extra game). She *should* be punished but you should talk to her now.", "This is a tough one, but ESH.   \n\n\nHere's why: \n\nYour daughter shouldn't be ungrateful about a present she gets. A samsung tablet is still a really good brand, and you could come up with alternatives for her to earn it - she's old enough for a job, maybe you could go halfsies? Payment plans? Etc.  \n\n\nRevoking the gift was bad enough, but I understand. What really tipped you into AH territory for me was the fact that you told an obviously upset teenager to call her dad *knowing his phone number was disconnected*. Whether she knows her father's number is disconnected or not is irrelevant. You chose to make her a part of your drama with your ex-husband, and you decided to dig into the wound that's fresh for both of you - you lost your husband and coparent, she lost her *father*. That was heartless, and it doesn't seem like you ever apologized, and you are the parent here.  \n\n\nWe all have our moments, and I don't blame you for that, but you are the parent. Be the bigger person.", "ESH. Your daughter is definitely acting like an entitled brat, but that is likely the result of feeling abandoned by her father. You are going through severe stress, but you should not be putting your financial burdens on your children. I think therapy would benefit all of you", "YTA; i\u2019m sure you are trying your best and I don\u2019t blame you for not having the money for a very expensive present, but not only did you leave her hanging on till the last minute and then reacted with a lot of anger when she did not react like you wanted her to (please remember she\u2019s still a child) but you also bought your other children what they wanted. Then you take away the one  present  she got? I know you\u2019re dealing with a lot, but she just a kid who lost her a lot of who made her who she is. She wasn\u2019t acting like a complete  brat; she was acting like a child, who is angry, and upset. If you want her to have mature reactions; I would\u2019ve definitely tried sitting down with her and letting her know you know there\u2019s not enough money for this right now, but how about what else can the two of you do together.", "YTA. Yes your daughter had a meltdown. She has lost her dad and now has to deal with a lower standard of living because of the divorce she is grieving the loss of her dad, who has disappeared. Instead of dealing with her like an adult, you took away her only Christmas present the next day, rather than having a talk with her about what she wanted to do with it. She may have gotten over the disappointment and might have used the tablet. Instead, you just showed her that you do not give a damn about what she is going through. Her world was turned upside down and you took out your frustration with her father out on her. Did you even talk to her about what else she might have wanted since the tablet was out of your price range? I understand that you are in a difficult circumstance but you could have waited a few days before returning the tablet. And had a talk with your daughter.", "Ok, so on the specific question of were you the AH for returning the tablet, yes. But that's only because you didn't recognize her tantrum as a symptom of something deeper, not for simply returning the tablet. Also, that bit about getting a job doesn't help anything. Overall, I'd say NAH, just some hurt people who need to be pulling together rather than letting things split them apart. \n\nYou all need to have open and honest conversations about everything, even if it has been a year since the divorce finalized. Their dad abandoned them, you, this is not something that will just be gotten over. She does miss her father, but not because you're a bad mom. Ever heard the phrase \"Hurt people hurt people\"? That's what that was.\n\nAs soon as you two are home, find a way to talk to her, alone. If you're comfortable with leaving the twins alone for a hour, go buy her ice cream or whatever. Just set some mom and daughter time so you two can talk. This will strain your relationship and its better to cut the rot your ex introduced now before it festers.", "Soft YTA. Your child had an emotional outburst because she\u2019s a child and that\u2019s what they do. She just lost her dad and has likely still not reconciled her emotions regarding all of the break up. It\u2019s good that you explained you\u2019re doing the best you can but your telling her she\u2019s old enough to get a job then returning her present makes you the AH. You say that\u2019s the end of it but just because she isn\u2019t talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Sit down with her and ask her why she\u2019s so disappointed. I doubt it\u2019s just the tablet.", "Hard to say as it goes both ways. On the one hand, yes, it is a trying time for your teen with the separation and divorce. On the other, she needs to learn how to appriciate what she has been gifted as well as you doing everything you are to provide.\n\nHopefully you two will be able to have a calm discussion about everything to patch up the rift over this situation.", "NTA but she is old enough that you can tell her how much you can spend and ask her to pick something in that price range.", "NTA.\n\nhave you considered shopping for a used ipad on ebay..? that's how i bought my laptop. and i did it with paypal credit. it was the only way for me to afford what i wanted, when i wanted it.", "NTA! People can be ungrateful. I would have taken back as well. Reminds me of those YouTube videos people used to post showing kids having meltdowns because it wasn't the right model, a model older than the latest and greatest etc. Stand your ground op. She can be happy or she can go without. It's not a necessity one bit.", "NTA should you  have been more tactful? Yup. But there's correct and there's reacting in the moment, two different things. We've all been there, it's hard for teens to understand sometimes what they want and what's possible are two different things. I would have held off on returning the gift - once everything calms down she will probably want it. And I'm sure her father leaving like that has devastated all of them - you should start looking for him and drag his sorry ass to court. Maybe you can start looking into therapy for her, I'm sure she could use it. But no, you're not an asshole - you're a tired person doing her best.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I probably would've told her when she asked for the iPad that her gift costs more than her sisters' combined and to figure something more in budget. Assuming cheapest, you spent about $300 (no tax) for a Switch Lite and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for them to share. Meanwhile your oldest is wanting basically over five times the value for herself. Then when she gets something for Christmas, she decided to be ungrateful and basically made you feel like a worthless parent, even though you're doing everything in your ability to raise her and her siblings and still have something of a good Christmas.\n\nNow, your line of telling her to go ahead and call her father might have been a little much, but I'm a full believer of matching energies, and she threw the shade first. To be nice to you as a mother, I won't sit here and call her a b\\*\\*\\*\\*. However, it is what she's acting like and she honestly needs to get some counseling before things get too bad.", "I would say NTA, but could of been handled completely differently. \nSpeak to your children, you'll be amazed how understanding they are once your let them know what's going on (truth). \n\nI'm a single mom to a almost 7 yr old that I spoil when I have the chnace. My car went into the shop and just spent $500 on it. (We had planned to go get universal studios passes for his bday in 1 week) I've told him we wouldn't be able to make it, he asked why, I answered honestly. All he said was ok, if we can get pizza and watch movies with his cousins at home which are the new plans now. They're capable of understanding if you give them the chance.... \n(Ps. I always speak to my son about everything that includes a major change, or things that are going on since he was born even if he didn't understand I always talked to him).", "NTA for returning the Christmas present. She threw a fit over not receiving an expensive gift, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to return the gift you did get her. But, you are TA for telling her to call her dad knowing that she couldn\u2019t. That was a terrible thing to say. You are the adult here and it\u2019s your responsibility to lead your family through this difficult time.", "NTA for taking the tablet back, as the kiddos actions warranted that move.  A side note though, an ipad pro is a significantly better tablet than the one you were trying to give her and that one would not have been capable of much, those cheap tablets are just crap.", "NAH. You ex is a huge one though. \n\nThat said I think you messed up a little. If your daughter was dead set on an iPad I wouldn\u2019t have just assumed she would just be okay with a Samsung tablet. I think at 16, you could have sat her down and had a one on one conversation and explained what you could afford and if she maybe wanted something different. Your daughter is clearly struggling to adjust as she was used to a certain financial standard of living and of course your ex just abandoning her.", "Ok so at first I was thinking NTA but I had to change my mind. Considering everything your going through it must be difficult but it\u2019s also difficult for your daughter as well. Yes you lost you husband but she lost the man that raised her, her father. She also had to see that your twins got exactly what they wanted and she might have been more emotional because of it. Additionally not to blame you at all but there was mention of you working more hours so that probably took you away from the home more than she is used to. Children do not always know the right way to express their emotions and can lash out at the wrong people. Even as an adult we can do or say things that can be petty/ childish. I.e. telling your daughter to call he dad when you knew his phone was disconnected. I say either get the tablet back or work out with her a different gift that you may be able to afford. If possible schedule her a meeting with a counselor to start working through the extra emotions. Overall good luck mom. Stay strong for the kiddos and I wish you the best !", "NTA, you both could have handled it better and been more thoughtful on what the other is going through.  The truth is that your daughter needs to learn that money is tight and it\u2019s not going back to the way it was.  Going forward it would be a good idea to give her a price range for Christmas and birthday gifts, eating out, clothes etc.  Be truthful and non-judge mental about their father, they need to know your not getting child support, that he cut off the phone.  If you do get child support again be honest with how much and where it\u2019s going.", "NTA. Your daughter is dealing with a lot and it's understandable that she is struggling with her emotions and the absence of her father. It's commendable that you did your best to provide for her and her sisters, but the situation with money can be tough and it's okay to have limits. However, it's also important to have an open and understanding conversation with your daughter about your financial situation and to try to find a solution together.", "NTA and bring on the downvotes. If the tablet would not be used, returning it was the right move. Budget is tight. Why let it sit unused? \n\nOP is abandoned financially and dealing with it. Good for her. It is only human to be hurt by a little snot-nose who digs at her by saying essentially that if dad was here she\u2019d have the tablet she aspired to. It might be true! Two incomes before the split. But that\u2019s not reality. \n\nOP, put aside the tablet money. Talk with 16 and offer it if she wants to earn the difference for the desired tablet. Reassure her that you understand what she wants, but it can\u2019t happen. Dad has bugged out. It impacts the family left behind.", "NTA. She should have been grateful for what she got and clearly wasn\u2019t. You did the best you could with what you had, balancing it out amongst all 3 kids. \n\nAnd, yes, if she is particular about getting that iPad pro, she can get a job and buy it herself.", "NTA. If she's going to whine about not getting what she wants, she gets nothing at all. 16 is WAY too old to throw tantrums about Christmas presents. All these YTA comments defending her baffles me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Apologize for the cruel remark, give her the cash amount you would've spent, and have an honest conversation with her.", "NTA.  She's trying to guilt you into giving her whatever she wants.  I would suggest sitting down with her and explaining the concept of a budget.  She's old enough to understand that circumstances have changed and that it probably had much more to do with your former spouse than with you (after all, he's walked away from his responsibilities, you haven't).  Put aside the $160 you spent on the tablet that was returned.  Put tell her you'll add some money to that for her birthday.  Explain that you are willing to help her get a part-time job so she can off-set the difference between what she wants and what you can afford.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like your ex is making his support payments.  Go after him for the money, hard and fast.  If he has any sort of professional license, most states will yank it until he is current with his child support.  Once his standard of living is negatively impacted, he will pay up.  Don't feel guilty about doing it.  He doesn't owe that money to you, he owes it to his kids.  Some of that money could also have helped off-set the cost of the iPad tablet his daughter wants.", "You're right. You should have been more understanding. Your children are struggling with your divorce just as much as you are. Probably more. You may be missing out on child support, but their father abandoned them. Of course there will be negative reactions. Of course they will act like brats. You got your youngest 2 exactly what they wanted, and used the leftover to get something for your eldest. But while they got what they wanted, she did not. \n\n>I told my daughter that it would be extremely difficult to get an ipad pro but I will do the best I can.\n\nYou gave her hope knowing you couldn't afford it, and just assumed she'd be fine with a surprise disappointment.

YTA.", "You know that this isn't about the tablet on either of your sides. She's missing her dad and she's old enough to truly understand that he fully abandoned her, but she's also not able to deal with that so she let's the bad feelings out on safe people (you) about topics that let her give physical form to the mass of rage and sorrow inside her (the tablet)\n\nAnd it's not about the tablet for you either.

You are her mother. Rubbing the fact that her father abandoned her in the face of a child is viscous. I get that her response is ungrateful and upsetting especially with how hard you have to work to provide, but seriously, that level of petty cruelty was not warranted as a response. She\u2019s a CHILD, struggling and expressing emotion in the face of having one parent walk out of her life and feeling she is the unfavored older kid by her remaining caregiver, something this experience probably reinforced. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to grant some leniency and understanding, throwing her abandonment at her as a retort and returning her gift the very next day is kind of going nuclear. She needs support - why haven\u2019t you talked or tried to resolve things with your child in over a month? I hope you can try to see her with more gentleness and have some empathy for her situation, being a teenager is extremely hard and isolating even without the terrible circumstances this girl is going through.", "YTA for throwing her father abandoning her in her face. Was her behavior okay? Not really, but that response is massively inappropriate. It\u2019s only going to exacerbate the problems she\u2019s having that you said all of that to her. \n\nReturning the tablet is fine, because honestly you probably shouldn\u2019t have bought it in the first place. You should have asked her what she would like that wasn\u2019t an iPad Pro but still within your budget. Your twins got exactly what they wanted (and an additional game!). You should have found another item she wanted so you could get her exactly what she wanted as well. It also would have helped her adjust expectations. It seems you lead her to believe you would do what you could to get her the iPad then just assumed you were on the same page. Making it clear she wouldn\u2019t get it so she should pick something else would have avoided this situation entirely. I get you were trying to do right by her and get her a tablet within your budget, but you shouldn\u2019t have let her expect something it would have been impossible for you to get.\n\nETA: Need to add that returning the tablet is fine, leaving her with no Christmas presents at all is not.

I\u2019m so sorry for your circumstances and I hate that I have to calm you the AH. You\u2019re ex is an absolute prick of misery and has put you in a horrible position.

You are the one she\u2019s going to take everything out on. It\u2019s not fair to you, but it\u2019s the way it is.

That's a pathetic thing for anyone to say to a 16 year old, much less their own mother.\n\nThe whole issue is down to your poor communication. You hadn't been clear to her, in your mind you thought you had been, but really you should have sat her down and explained things properly.\n\nThere's also the issue with immediately returning the tablet the next day. Again your communication is just bad. You made no attempt to speak to her? She is your daughter you know, not a stranger.\n\nWas the tablet going to be used for art?

She's angry and upset and the tablet became a way to express that.\n\nYTA \n\nYou need to have a bit of patience with your daughter because it's perfectly reasonable that she's going through a rough time. While you don't have to necessarily tolerate her outbursts, returning the gift was actually a step too far in context to what's happening.", "YTA. This is hard, of course she misses her dad and the life she had before. It\u2019s not unusual for a teenager of any background to overreact to not getting what they expected and get a \u201clower\u201d gift. She more than likely would have realized what a great gift it was given time but you didn\u2019t give her any. She\u2019s a teenager going through a lot; she will one way day realize what you went through to provide but she\u2019s not there yet. This behavior will only make her resent you.

I pulled that line with my mama too and my dad was a deadbeat. \n\nI think the 16 yo is old enough for a discussion about finances.

Has she gotten any kind of counseling to help her with the divorce?", "ESH-. i can see why you did that, bud i cna also see that your daughter felt unlove because her sister get an very expensive thing plus game ( which would be 400-500$ with the game), \n\nyour husband, her father left you, she is an child that can\u2019t control her emotions who suddenly had her dad rip away from her, no way to contact him then saw her sister open up an Nintendo switch and two games. the way you react was awful. i understand your struggling but so is your daughter. you could of settle for an ipad from pawn shop, facebook marketplace, online same with the switch so you can save some money. you then return the gift instead of taking it away. you don\u2019t return gifts after you give it.", "Why exactly didn\u2019t you tell her the allotted budget, and to find something she\u2019d be happy with in that price range? You set her up for disappointment. \n\nShitty set up, and SUPER shitty response to her teenage reaction.", "NTA, that\u2019s a huge budget item for someone who is 16 and can get a job. You did the right thing, throwing a fit because she didn\u2019t get her way is classic manipulation. Sometime the decisions you make are tough but there is nothing wrong with taking the hard choice. I also applaud you returning the gift, but I would also really try to communicate with her about the whole situation.", "YTA. What were you hoping to accomplish by telling her to call her father on a disconnected line? You KNOW you said that to hurt her, and no amount of your exhaustion as a single parent and nurse makes what you said okay. Your finances, job, and stress are an explanation, but not a justification for saying something so cruel to your daughter who is also struggling. \n\nRemember, this is your FAMILY. These are your CHILDREN. You are all on the same team, and you\u2019re the adult. Im sorry you\u2019re all going through a rough transition, and hope you\u2019re al able to get through it. But YTA 100% here, and this will have lasting consequences if you don\u2019t try to amend the situation.", "NTA. Your Ex Is AH. \n\nI would\u2019ve given the kid a pass at being disappointed but throwing a tantrum at a GIFT?Hell no. Lashing out at you bc dad isn\u2019t there when now you\u2019re handling all the parenting? Hell no. \nReturning the tablet and put those funds towards what she wants? OK. Does she want it enough to earn half the cost? Get a job? Does her situation suck? Yeah so does yours! Everyone is adjusting to the new norm.  Lashing out at the ones who are still around isn\u2019t going to help anyone. Squash this now. with some harsh facts of life.\nI understand you were frustrated and said why not call your dad \u2026 sounds like she\u2019s not reaching to her dad either. Like what she only cares around Xmas time? Bc while she may miss him, it may also not be that deep\u2014 very possible she also just wants the gifts she\u2019s used to. All these Kids are gonna grow up a little faster than you\u2019d like.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter acted like an entitled brat. While I understand she is upset about dad this is the definition of f around and find out.", "Yta , why did the twins BOTH get switches but she couldn\u2019t get a new iPad. If one kids electronic was getting swapped for a cheap model the other kids should\u2019ve too.", "Info: Why does it have to be 800 bucks for the ipad with the pencil? You could find a used one with a 1st generation pencil. Is your daughter an artist? This may be much more important for her than some game. For me, my iPad is everything. I live on it when I am not teaching. I do all my artwork in it. I think you may want to see this from her side. For now YTA.", "She was ungrateful yes but she's going through a hard time . Have some mercy on her.", "I'm going to say NTA overall, but you handled this in a very shitty way.\n\nSome Samsung touch tablet is not a good brand alternative for the iPad pro with the pencil. Certainly she wanted to draw with it, and the two experiences just aren't comparable. Not to mention the Apple and Android software ecosystems are entirely different, she may have wanted to join her friends in the Apple sphere, and the new tablet in her view may indeed be totally useless.\n\nSo I can understand you can't afford $800, and I can understand you think she's being ungrateful because she received something, but you're also showing a lack of understanding and empathy and some degree of ignorance to the technology involved.\n\nAn apple gift card \"towards\" the iPad might have been a more encouraging choice for the 16 year old.\n\nAlso if I am not mistaken, a Nintendo Switch with two first-party titles (the two Pokemon games) is more than two times $160. So it does seem as if you treated the other kids more favourably than the older girl. Furthermore, the two younger girls got exactly what they wanted, and the oldest did not. So it's also unfair on that basis as well.", "Nta. My mom would have said way worse. She is 16. Old enough to understand the situation.  She is struggling and I get that but so are you, abd you need to provide and take care of 3 kids on your own. Everyone is struggling not just her. At 16 she should have more empathy.", "YTA. Instead of being a grown up and giving a modicum of understanding to your child who has just been abandoned by a parent, you lashed out and retaliated at her for\u2026acting like the teenager she is. Like yeah she could have been grateful but she also just watched her sibs get exactly what they wanted and then she got something that she didn\u2019t\u2014while being already accustomed to getting what she wanted basically all the time before the divorce. Idk how you have a whole night to think about this and still chose to return it the next day.", "YTA - she misses her dad who abandoned her, and she cant articulate it well cause shes 16. I dont think it was about the gift.", "What exactly happened during this divorce? I know this kind of stuff happens but basically vanishing without a trace after 16 years as a parent in the age of social media seems difficult. Like can\u2019t the courts lock his accounts?", "NTA. Tough love is good, I would just follow it up with a conversation about how she\u2019s doing. Could be her lashing out because she\u2019s upset your ex left her too.", "NTA for your question (returning the gift), but you definitely messed up responding to her that way.", "YTA\n\nLook, I get that money is tight and you can\u2019t get her the iPad she wanted. I also get that your ex leaving you is extremely difficult on multiple fronts. But your daughter is 16, and her father left. The life you built was turned upside down, but everything she\u2019s ever known is different now. She doesn\u2019t have the sense of self, the maturity, or the life experience to deal with it the way you can. To add to that abandonment, receiving the cheaper tablet when her siblings got exactly what they wanted probably feels like you don\u2019t love her either. Getting the cheaper tablet was the right financial move, but she needs some other kind of reassurance that you still love her, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to break the bank. She threw a tantrum, but she\u2019s a teenager, and that\u2019s what they do. Telling her to call her missing father knowing full well she can\u2019t was cruel, and so was returning the tablet. She had an emotional outburst, fueled by fear and hurt and abandonment, and you, her only parental figure left, said \u201cok, now you get nothing.\u201d That\u2019s not ok. You\u2019re an adult and are held to a higher standard than your 16 year old.\n\nShe needs support and therapy badly. If you can\u2019t afford it, talk to her school. They should have some kind of counseling available.", "The biggest issue is that there is a lack of healthy communication between both parties. Not setting proper expectations about the actual financial situation, proper discussion of things that would be acceptable if an Ipad couldn't be achieved. Both grieving this new situation and using anger words to attack each other instead of having a healthy discussion of what their feeling and why. Get some family therapy.", "Yta if you couldn't get all the kids their top gift, then why didn't you get them all their 2nd gift.  I understand that you're going though a lot of stress, but you're *an adult* going through that stress.  Yoir daughter is 16yo.  She got to watch her sister get exactly what they wanted and she didn't. \n\n\n Then, you went nuclear and decided to return the gift and tell her to call her dad *knowing the number was disc*.  You used your divorce to hurt your kid rather than wait and have a calm conversation about it.  Yeesh.\n\nWas she being ungrateful, sure. Did you handle it like a loving parent or even just like an adult?  Nope.", "NTA. You are doing your best and it is frustrating at times. Please please disregard the YTA\u2019s. Look after yourself.", "I\u2019m going say ESH\u2026 your response to your daughter was horrible. She\u2019s is grieving and angry. But yes she did have a brat moment.", "ESH - But you\u2019re her mom and the adult here, next time you have the chance just hug her and tell her you love her. That\u2019s clearly what she needs the most. You can\u2019t change the fact that her dad abandoned them and you also can\u2019t change that you have to work crazy and long hours, and of course you\u2019re exhausted, irritated and just want some peace and relax but don\u2019t have any time for it, but when you have the chances to take just a minute for your girls to show them your love, by hugging them or give them a kiss on their cheek (I know, how embarrassing), but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love it. And it\u2019s not just for them, you also feel their love for you. Just make sure that you take this moment just for them and give them your whole attention.", "NTA but you might have just told her the budget and asked her to find a few items in the budget instead of lead her on that she may get it.", "It was a soft YTA until we got to you actually returning the tablet, then you def became YTA. You can't say that your 16 y/o should be more understanding to your predicament then not bother understanding where she is coming from! Her dad just left! Abandoned her! Does she even know why? Does she blame you or herself? Does she know anything? Her entire life changed and she probably feels like her own dad doesn't love her anymore and barely See's her mother. So yeah, she's going to be upset. You shouldn't have returned the tablet, all you did was disregard her feelings and take away her only Christmas present because she acted emotionally then you went and did the same exact thing!", "You SHOULD have been more understanding of her situation.  YTA for returning the gift, not for the things you said about deadbeat dad.  You should have talked to her after she calmed down, and offered to return it to get her whatever she wanted at that value.  It was very difficult to see siblings get exactly what they wanted.  I definitely understand you being unable to buy the expensive gift, just try to be more compassionate.  She lashed out at you, but she is a child.  You are an adult and need to stay more level headed.", "ESH, you moreso for what you said. You're an adult. She's a teenager whose father abandoned her. Of course she's going to lash out, especially during the holidays when his absence is even more pronounced. I mean, it sounds like this their first Christmas without him! Yeah, she was being a brat, but given the circumstances I think you should've been a little more gracious about it.\n\nAnd I know this isn't really germane to the conversation, but you could have gotten her a used iPad Pro off eBay\u2014it wouldn't be the latest version obviously, but older versions go for pretty cheap (comparatively.) \n\nDoes she have a part time job? Can you offer to split the cost with her\u2014put the money you got from the returned tablet towards one if she can come up with the difference? I think that'd be a reasonable compromise, since it'd also show her what the value of one actually is and might help her to understand your financial situation better.", "I mean, switches plus a premium game are much more expensive than a $160 tablet. I get that you're on a budget, are a single mom (which is ROUGH), and can only do so much. Maybe a more equal division of funds could have gone over better. However, you did cross a line returning her gift, so unfortunately I have to go with YTA.", "ESH. She\u2019s being a kid. You lacked tact in a major way. You husband put you in this position. He doesn\u2019t visit, call, or pay support? Are you pursuing this? Because you should, for the sake of you kids at least get child support. You can save it for college or other expenses, but get it. If he doesn\u2019t pay get a judgement. They\u2019ll find him and make him pay.", "INFO: Did you get one switch or two? Because a switch is easily around $300, and each game is $60 so that\u2019s already almost $500\n\nAlso was it not an option to give her the $500 and she matches the rest?

You chose to get a divorce, and her father chose to abandon his children. She had no choice in any of this. She's also had to adjust to a very different financial reality, from what you're describing. You don't have to drop $800 on a tablet, but you could have a little compassion. She watched her sister's unwrap exactly what they asked for, then didn't get what she asked for. As adults, you and I can both get why, but teenagers are going to live in emotion more than logic. Instead of giving her feelings space, you punished her for having them by returning the only gift she got, rubbed in that her father stopped loving her, and told her she's too old to deserve your care.  Sounds like she lost both parents in the divorce. She's probably counting the days until she can move out and never see you again. I hope you're not always like this, because it's truly terrible parenting, and you owe her an abject apology (and a replacement tablet).

Suggestion, next year have your children go on Amazon and make a wishlist - giving them reasonable expectations.\n\nHOWEVER, telling her to call her father who essentially abandoned her was not right. It was cruel. I know you felt hurt by her behavior, but you are responsible and accountable for your own reactions. More importantly, lashing out at her only further alienated the situation.

It's been over a month, so I have to assume things haven't been amazing if you're posting here now, but it would be good to know.\n\n\n\nI was raised as the oldest sibling by essentially a single mother on a teacher's salary. I will never forget, and be forever grateful, of all the sacrifices she made for me. And all the love, strength, and courage that it took to persevere in the face of so much hardship.\n\nI will also never forget the feeling of being a burden to her. And the devastation of even a single comment confirming all my fears growing up, calling me a \"parasite\" in her (and everyone around me's) life. It honestly devastated my self-esteem way more than all of the times my dad didn't show up to visit after he said he would.\n\nMy mom is a very complicated person, and as much as I have never doubted that she loves me (and I her), our relationship has suffered a lot over the years over barely hidden frustration, at times even resentment, raising several daughters as a single parent caused.\n\n\n\nMy heart goes out to both of you. This is an incredibly difficult situation all around. It's okay to grieve over what you had. It's okay to struggle. It's okay to not succeed at raising more than a $500 budget total for Christmas presents between 3 girls. In fact, I find it impressive and amazing that you even managed to save so much.\n\nWhat's not okay is raising her hopes up that you just miiight be able to swing an iPad, not talking to her when you realized what your final budget was, and then acting blindsided and surprised when she was upset and disappointed over it. What's not okay is venting out your anger in the moment and saying something hurtful for a bit of momentary gratification (if you even felt good about saying that), when it's something that will damage your relationship-- and her self-esteem-- for the long term. It's not worth it, it really isn't.\n \n\n\nBut, you're not perfect. No one is. So if you're reading this, among the hundreds of comments in this thread, I don't think you're an AH for being human. I dont think your daughter is an AH for momentarily behaving like a brat when going through so much as well. I think there's NAH, and if you're up for some unsolicited advice on what to do, here's what I think.\n\n\n1. Apologize. You know you did something wrong so, if you haven't already, just own up to it and apologize. Trust me, even if she's not receptive to it now, apologizing for what you said now will go a long way when she's remembering this whole situation in the future. There's nothing to lose but pride, and everything to gain.\n\n2. Talk to her about this. I know you said you've had conversations about money being tight before, so do so again. Without pinning blame on her for being \"ungrateful\" or not, just have an honest conversation about expectations, and try not to set her up for disappointment in the future. Sure, it takes a bit of the \"magic\" away from Christmas to already know what she's getting beforehand, but I think the tradeoff is fair in this scenario.\n\n3. If you still have the money lying around, and want to make it up to her, suggest her getting a job again and just start a savings fund you can put the money from the tablet into, and she can contribute to it as well from her own money in the future. \n\nThere are certain things iPads can do, that other tablets can, so going the substitution option would not work if she wanted it, for example, for art. But a good option other people have pointed out in the comments is getting a refurbished one, or an older model. It has all of the benefits of an iPad Pro with a pencil, and the added benefit of not being $800 a pop.\n\n\n\nTLDR; I think there are NAH here, but your words have an impact. And while you may forget them with time, she will always remember what you said, but especially how you made her feel. You still have the chance to fix this, so do so. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's your daughter. Are you really going to permanently damage your relationship over one bratty tantrum on her first Christmas without her dad?", "NTA, though you handled this poorly with the \"call your father\" comment. Your daughter was cruel and ungrateful, and needed to learn the lesson that the world doesn't revolve around her wants. She is also grieving and lashing out because she's 16 and doesn't know a better way to regulate her emotions. Returning the tablet was the right call to make for her outburst, but you dipped into AH territory with your dig about her father. \n\nIt might be time to sit her down and show her how you make a budget, which is a skill she should learn anyway. She's old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees and you do the best with what you have. Set aside the $160 for the tablet and tell her that you can contribute x amount per month to the iPad fund (say $10 or $20, or whatever you can reasonably manage). If she matches it, she'll have her iPad sooner. Use this as a teaching moment, and not a moment to hurt each other deeper.\n\nYou are both grieving and deserve a little grace in this shitty situation. Your ex is the biggest AH here for abandoning your kids.", "YTA", "ESH gently, but yeah antagonizing your teenage daughter after her dad just abandoned his family is a bit harsh, even if she was being a spoiled brat.\n\nI would have kept the tablet hidden in my closet or something like that, until I was able to sit down & have a proper conversation with her about how hard it has been on all of you for dad to up & leave with no forwarding address, so to speak.\n\nIt sucks but the reality is she is still a child & adjusting to a major change in financial situation is difficult for anyone, let alone a high school kid.\n\nYou are both hurting, don't take it out on each other.", "NTA.

Just ask any adult with siblings that went off the rails while the others are healthy functioning adults.", "And let\u2019s be honest. While I know all the kids miss their (deadbeat) dad every day, the only reason she said it Christmas morning was because she was pissed she didn\u2019t get what she wanted and she was trying to hurt her mom", "You can't have more than one save file on a single Pokemon game.", "Yep, this actually happened to me. When I was younger I asked my mum for an ipad and got a samsung tablet. The appeal was that it was an apple product and could sync to my iphone etc/use my aps I had already bought. I was so excited about it I full on prepared for what aps to use/looked up features nearly obsessively. I pretended to be happy but I was so disappointed. I ended up not even using the Samsung and when I could afford it bought the ipad myself which I still use to this day without upgrading.", ">But there\u2019s a huge difference between a Samsung tablet\n\nCome on, now.  This is for a teenager. The Samsung tablet is more than adequate, and if the daughter wants something better she can start to save up for it.", "You're not going to find used copies of the new Pokemon game for a price much lower than retail.", "Presenting getting a job as an option wouldn't be mean. \"this is what I can afford. If you want something more, you're going to have to get a job.\" is fine. The daughter is 16?; she can legally work and a lot of kids her age do. That's not mean; that's a viable alternative. \n\nIf you don't like the present, give it back isn't the truth. It's an option/demand/punishment, depending on the scenario. And the wording I suggested *was* the truth - their financial situation has changed. They can no longer afford $800 Christmas presents. It was just not the truth told in an intentionally cruel way. (I also don't think we have enough data to say if the girl is spoiled or not. She acted in a spoiled manner at the time, but she was incredibly stressed, she's been abandoned by her father, her siblings got what they wanted and she didn't - yes that's life but teens are usually still learning that life isn't fair - and I suspect the outburst was more about losing her dad than not getting what she wanted. Either way, her mom has been her parent all her life, so mom doesn't get to throw up her hands and blame dad.) \n\nIdk what you mean by new age parenting, but if you mean parents who approach the situation like they are the adult and their children are children, then yeah I'm an advocate for that. That language was telling the kid the truth. It just wasn't doing it in a way primarily designed to hurt her.", "They definitely can know how to be hurtful. What they don't know/get is what the real consequences can be of the things they say. I'm not saying that gives them an unlimited free pass to be little shits but they don't fully grasp how shitty they're being.", "My tween told me just tonight how the class was actively trying to make a specific teacher miserable so she'll quit...the mental mind tricks they are pulling is way beyond what I could have done at that age, kids these days are built differently."]}
