Needless to say, we get a lot of passerby.\n\nOver Memorial Day weekend, one of my neighbors decided to have a \u201cgarage sale\u201d in front of our building. He does keep things on the building steps and the lawn in front, but keeps a path open from the front door and doesn\u2019t block the sidewalk. He\u2019s probably in his 60s, and although I thought it was weird at first glance, it also seemed sort of naive and sweet so I wasn\u2019t bothered by it. I figured he wasn\u2019t tech savvy and this was the only way he knew to get rid of some of his belongings, so no sweat. \n\nFast forward to December 2023, he has continued to have these sales every single weekend since May.  Every Sunday, he hauls a random bunch of junk out in like 5 shopping carts, lays it all out in front of our building and sits out there, sometimes with a friend, from basically 9am to sunset. He leaves all the shopping carts he uses in the lobby area (lobby is a stretch, it\u2019s a very small room with our mailboxes and elevators) and has since referred to it as \u201cI\u2019m going to work\u201d to me. As far as I can tell he accumulates other items, no idea how or from where, and has started selling them in front of our building each week. \n\nAs far as I\u2019ve heard, multiple tenants in the building are frustrated by these \u201csales\u201d. This is not exactly a cheap building - I pay $2250 a month for a one bedroom apartment. Myself and multiple others have complained to the landlord who said he had to look into the legal piece of it and then never followed up. After months and months of hoping the landlord would do his job and handle this politely, it seems that isn\u2019t going to happen. \n\nI looked up the laws for yard sales in my city and have learned that you are only allowed to have them once a year on a specific weekend of each month, and if you\u2019d like to have a second, you have to get special permits. But even that is assuming you are having a yard sale at a property you own, as far as I understand they are completely illegal in rental and commercial locations. \n\nThe empath in me really wanted this to be resolved without this man having to get a ticket because I don\u2019t know his financial status. But if he lives in this building, it seems to me that he can already afford to live here through means that do not involve these garage sales. I should also mention that for the year I lived here prior to Memorial Day, he had never once thrown one (he\u2019s lived here longer than me). I know if I call the police they will come and he will get a ticket for this and theoretically stop doing it. But for some reason, I still feel bad putting him in that position. \n\nAITA if I report him to the police?", "created_utc": 1703013426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m9xeh/aita_for_wanting_to_report_my_neighbors_illegal/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The landlord owns the building, and can enforce this guy not leaving his junk in common areas, and can enforce him not doing yard sales as well.\n\nI'd say make it the Landlord's problem, get all the other tenants who are bothered by it together, hire a tenant lawyer (won't cost much if y'all are splitting it) and start putting your rent into an escrow account instead of paying it, put your landlord on notice that until he does his job he's not getting a dime. Most states have legal protections that allow you to do this and don't allow him to try to evict for nonpayment as long as you follow process to the letter and pay the missing rent out of the escrow account once the issue is resolved (this is where the lawyer comes in).\n\nCops will solve this one problem this one time, but the *real* problem is your landlord won't get off his ass and do his job, and calling the cops does *nothing* to address that problem.", "NTA.

My parents had a neighbor that had yard sales every weekend and people would park in their driveway and block their driveway. It's really annoying. Being annoyed by it doesn't say anything negative about you. You have to give your name to the police department. It's better to talk to him first cause I think any bad feelings may come with calling the police before making your concerns known directly to him first. Ask him if he is purchasing this stuff or if it's his. He may not want to answer but buying clothes in bulk without washing them first could bring bed bugs and other infestations. I do think you would be the asshole if you called the police without first telling him directly that you all don't like it and it's becoming a nuisance and asking him to stop.

The carts in the entryway would probably bother me, but as a tenant, I would recommend working with the landlord on this one. The landlord can't ignore it forever if people keep bugging him. Honestly that goes for this whole situation. If it's that inconvenient, make it the landlord's problem, not the cops.
