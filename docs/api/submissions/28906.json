If your parents give all their worldly goods to a homeless person it is their prerogative. Your talking about what everyone gets after they die makes you seem that all you care about is their worldly possessions. Your issue is with your brother, SIL and their lifestyle. You cannot control what your parents do with their money, living or dead. Be grateful for what you do get instead of creating conflict with your parents. You know you can\u2019t trust your sibling and his wife. Keep them at a distance. Pop by, give your niece her gift and leave. Or give it to another family member to give to her. No need to make her suffer because her parents and uncle are AHs.", "ESH. \n\nHave you considered since they have a child and have had issues with the law that the family recognizes that he needs more support? \n\nThe idea that every sibling should get the exact same thing is a very childish viewpoint. People are different, they have different needs, strengths and weaknesses. Parents have to use the resources they have available to them to ensure they are supporting their children in the best way they can. I assume they don\u2019t have 4 houses on hand to just rent out to all their kids.", "ESH", "The part where you are TA in my eyes is the house. It is your dad's (assuming he officially owns it since you said he is the landlord), that means he can do with it what he wants. Using it to help his child and grandchild have a nice place to live that doesn't break the bank doesn't seem wrong to me. Sure, maybe he isn't giving perfectly evenly to all the kids, but that is just life. At different points in our lives my brother and I have gotten more or less form my mom than the other. I lived with her (for free) for a bit after school. My brother had a house and paid a mortgage. I was getting far more than he was, but AFAIK he has never resented me or mom for it. When my grandma died, my cousin and her family ended up moving into her house. My aunt made a stink about it. Nobody else who legally had a share of the house did, much less people who didn't.", "YTA - that\u2019s not your house to claim. Maybe it\u2019s unfair that only one sibling gets a discount to live in a family home, but that\u2019s really not your business as it\u2019s not your house and, therefore, you have zero claim to it.\n\nYour brother and SIL sound annoying. You can choose how far you want to take your grudge, but your niece will notice your absence and isn\u2019t going to wonder what her parents did to cause this. Family is messy, but it sounds like you\u2019re making it messier. Sure, they\u2019re annoying and entitled, but you decided to escalate a stupid argument by bringing up business that nothing to do with you\u2026 and now you want to cut everyone loose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also having experienced several deaths and issues with inheritance and the entitlement that comes with it, I read your post with that in mind. I can only tell you that your brother does what he does because your father allows it. You see it and that\u2019s what frustrates you. It\u2019s not going to change until your dad dies. Maybe have him write what he says and get it notarized besides guarantee when something happens, your brother is coming in with guns blazing. Be prepared."]}
