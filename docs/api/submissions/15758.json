Before learning about her I was going through a nasty divorce with my ex-wife \"Rachel\" (47f) who successfully turned our daughter \"Amy\" (22f) against me. I tried to keep a relationship with Amy and even wanted to put her in therapy but Rachel blocked me at every turn.\n\nThe problem was that I took a job that I hated and worked ridiculously long hours in order to keep up the Upper-Middle class lifestyle that Rachel wanted but without having to work herself. After I finished paying off the house Rachel was talking about buying a newer more expensive one, but I wasn't onboard. I was finally able to cut back on working so much and wanted to spend more time being a present parent to Amy. Rachel accused me of being a bad father because I didn't want to provide Amy with the best and told me that she would divorce me if I didn't agree to getting a new house and car.\n\nI called her bluff but she meant it, and when Amy didn't get the new car her mom promised her on her birthday I was the scapegoat. This divorce bled me dry and since Rachel had sole custody it was either her way or nothing, as I didn't have the money to take her to court. I was miserable and in a dark place and then Lea came in. She reached out to me through a friend on social media and asked me if I would be willing to do a DNA test. I agreed and she was my daughter.\n\nLea was the daughter of an ex who ended up disappearing on me without a word. Turns out her grandparents were furious when they discovered Lea's mom was pregnant and dragged her out of the house in the middle of the night to go live with relatives until Lea was born and then pass her off as someone else's baby. Lea assured me that she never blamed me for anything and was just hoping to get to know me.\n\nShe convinced me to go to therapy and we grew closer and I even reconnected with Lea's mom. During this time I never once told Amy because she changed her number, blocked me on social media, and threatened to call the cops if I ever showed up to her place. Lea has a daughter \"Ashley\" (5f) who's in kindergarten and when Lea asked if I wanted to show up to a family event at Ashley's school I happily accepted. Lea, Ashley, Lea's mom, and I all took turns taking pictures at the school and then went out as a family later that day.\n\nI guess between the school and restaurant someone who knew Amy or Rachel saw me, told them, and found Lea's social media pages. After years of no contact Amy finally reached out but only to chew me out for getting married and having a new child without telling her. Amy thought Lea was my wife. But after Lea's mom was able to prove that we were the ones who were/currently involved Amy was still angry. She felt as if I should've tried harder but I'm not sure what I could've done so AITA?", "created_utc": 1682536741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zvvw1/aita_for_not_telling_my_daughter_and_exwife_about/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I guess she may be jealous that you are now a good fathter to Lea, but you weren't/aren't to her.
