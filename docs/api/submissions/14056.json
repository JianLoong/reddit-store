That changed when we became teens as we couldn't be more different. I am into sports and I became a cheerleader. She on the other hand has always been more creative, she was in the music club and played the flute in the school bands for a couple years. We didn't really spend time together since I'd rather spend time with my friends who were mostly cheerleaders too because we had to spend a lot of time together for practice. Thing is, we weren't even close anymore and didn't even visited each other anymore by then.\n\nWhen I was 17 my cousin cut me off from her life. She was already in college and had a boyfriend (22 at the time). She went to a college in our home town so I also knew this guy even before they started dating since we had seen each other in some parties. The thing is that as we saw each other frequently at parties we ended up sleeping together a couple times, some of those times were even before they got together.  Well when my cousin found out she made a big scandal and she cut me off, but she didn't broke off with the guy at the moment. \n\nNow this cousin has got married (to another man). She didn't sent me an invitation but she did invited my family (parents and siblings). I was offended by this, I told them they shouldn't go because they're my family and should support me. My dad said they won't go. \n\nThe wedding was last Saturday. I don't live with my parents so I just spend the day with friends and we went to a party that a college classmate had hosted. The next day I was scrolling on Facebook and I saw that my grandma had uploaded some photos from the wedding. In one of them my grandma was with my family.\n\nI got very angry because they promised to not go so I called my mom. I told them what they promised and how I feel like they betrayed me, this cousin doesn't even treat me as family and they don't care. She told me to get over it and that if I wanted to be included in family events then I should've thought that before doing what I did. She said they don't have to avoid their family because of me. I think this is something incredibly cruel to say to your own daughter, I feel very hurt now. Are they right or not?\n\n\nEdit: I didn't knew she was dating this guy because at the time we were already not close. A friend told me she had seen this guy with a girl and told me to ask if she was his girlfriend, but he told me it was a friend. My cousin found out later because she read some texts we had exchanged.", "created_utc": 1680700384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cjyep/aita_for_getting_angry_at_my_family_for_going_to/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your cousin drifted apart as teenagers.  When she was in college, you slept with her boyfriend while they were dating.  This was the final straw for her, and she rightly cut you off.

They went as your cousins uncle and aunt, and they didn't have to satisfy some approval system in your head. You made them choose over their entire family essentially and you. \n\nYou are an adult. If you are invited, you can go, if you are not, then don't. You going to hate the rest of your family for \"choosing\" your cousins side over you? You are an adult. You can stay home and they can go. simple as that.", "YTA\n\nShe has every right to no longer like you or want you at her special day.", "YTA.  You slept with her bf.  This is either fake or the most obvious question I have ever read on here.", "YTA. \n\nYou slept with your cousin's boyfriend, she cut you off, you are not owed an invitation to her wedding. I see in your comments and edit you can't exactly pick a story- you kind of knew they were seeing each other, you didn't know, whatever. Point is, she cut you out of her life and she can absolutely do that. You have no \"right\" to a relationship with someone. \n\nYour cousin invited the rest of your family to the wedding, and it is up to them whether they want to go. Your Dad said they wouldn't go, but your Mom clearly had other feelings so sure, you can have an issue with your Dad lying to you, but it was only your Dad. \n\nAnd no, they don't have to stand in solidarity with you. Life is long, they don't want to miss big family events because two cousins don't get along. Why are you even \"offended\" that someone you haven't been close to since you were 17- and were so \"not close\" that you didn't even know you were sleeping with her boyfriend- wouldn't invite you to their wedding? But she is closer with your parents, so she invited them. That's how life works, you aren't destined an invite because you are a blood relative, regardless of the backstory. \n\nAnd with the backstory, you are just more of an AH.", "YTA", "I get why you are hurt, really. \n\nBut you don't get to demand that other adults not do things because you weren't included. \n\nThey should not have lied to you. You should not have put them in the position to have to lie to you. \n\nESH.", "Get over it.  Your whole family doesn\u2019t need to bow to you.  YTA.", "YTA. \n\n>She said they don't have to avoid their family because of me. I think this is something incredibly cruel to say to your own daughter, I feel very hurt now.\n\nShe is right. You were cut off because you helped the man chea, knowingly or not.", "Yeah OP glossed right over what sounds like a pretty justifiable reason for her getting cut out of the cousins life. \n\nYTA based on the wording right here. It really sounds like OP slept with her cousins boyfriend. Big shock she didn't get a wedding invite if that's correct.", "Yeah i am also curious. Did you do that op?", "It does mean that because she said the cousin didn\u2019t leave the boyfriend right away.", "The classic reddit post move of whispering the important parts lol", "Eh yeah, I wasn't sure though because we didn't speak to each other by then", "But why can they lie to me?", "Exactly! Why would the cousin treat her like family when she knowingly slept with her boyfriend when they were together. YTA OP and a big one at that.", "He's not her actual husband, they broke of some time after all of that happened. She's married to another man.", "Exactly!   I mean did she ever try to apologize to the cousin?  And no, the family should not have to take sides here.  OP is making it an either her or me thing when it doesn't have to be.  \n\nSounds like she wants to hurt the cousin, even on the most special of occasions.  Given she felt the need to talk about the differences in high school it sounds like bullying.  Dad should not have lied, but that doesn't take away from how wrong op is for trying to manipulate and hurt others.", "I wasn't even sure if they were together or not because we already didn't spoke to each other, the guy and I had like a \"thing\" going one before they started dating though", "No once I found out he had a girlfriend we didn't slept together every again", "The cousin is petty and immature for not wanting her ex boyfriend's side piece, which is to also be her cousin at her wedding? The fuck planet are you from? You must be someone's side piece too that thinks the world recolves around them", "Yikes\u2026.", "Hpw in the world do you figure the cousin is petty and immature?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Seriously?", "\u201cEh, yeah\u201d \u2014 this attitude about sleeping with her boyfriend shows quite clearly that yes you are the AH here.", "YTA. Your cousin has every reason to not invite you based on that.", "YTA - Seriously, you expect her to invite you to her wedding? Just because you two are on the outs, apparently with good reason, doesn't mean the rest of your family is.\n\nYou don't live with your parents, so it's not like she excluded one person living in the same house, which can be a touch tacky depending on circumstances. \n\nWhy would she pay good money to have someone she clearly doesn't like stressing her out at her wedding? And why should the rest of your family be punished for what you did?\n\nYou're coming off very entitled.", "Wait - you fucked your cousins boyfriend and now you\u2019re mad because she didn\u2019t invite you to her wedding? \n\nYou\u2019re not the main character \ud83d\ude44\nBut - \nYTA", "Then I would say YTA. If you didn't know they were together, and then you found out. 1000000 apologies should have been given. If you were open and honest about the mistake, and did apologize because you didn't know, then I would change to NTA, and your family would be the A for her putting all the blame on you and not the boyfriend who DID know he was in a relationship.  \n\n\nDid your Dad know about the history before saying they wouldn't go? If he did, then they changed their mind he is also an A. If he didn't and then changed his mind, he's slightly an A for not telling you he would be going. They can change their minds and go, but it would have been nice for them to warn you and let you know they want to support her, and your past drama with each other doesn't mean they can't go.", "wait do you mean that you drifted apart from your cousin and then slept with her bf ( not knowing that he was cousin\u2019s bf)? because I can see how one can feel that they are being wrongly punished \n\nbut if you knew that the bf was cousin\u2019s and still slept with him \u2026. Of course cousin is not going to invite you to her wedding lol", "I didn't say they can lie to you.\n\nStop trying to shift the blame to them.

My guess is they didn't want to hear your protestations and faux outrage during the lead up to the wedding. You slept with your cousin's boyfriend.

These are yours. You do bad things. Bad things happen to you... Eventually. Your parents can do whatever they want.

You knowingly slept with her boyfriend. Whether it\u2019s the guy she married or not is irrelevant. The only one who betrayed family is you.", "So that makes it okay?", "Note you don\u2019t say i didn\u2019t know.  You say weren\u2019t sure.
