It'll be a hell of a lot harder if she keeps this up and drives you away from the family. Being a single parent isn't easy.", "NTA but you two definitely need couples counseling. You know you were wrong in some early decisions you made after going back to work so you\u2019re willing to admit mistakes which then this behavior from your wife indicates to me that you two need couples counseling.

Sometimes for well over a week. He's leaving next week again  for 4 nights. It's easier to have him there but it's not \"worse\" when he's not there.

But she doesn't get to talk from two sides of her mouth to make you the bad guy.", "NTA but your wife could be harboring resentment or still suffering from post partum depression disorder.  Either way recommend individual and couples therapy.  It should be a safe environment where you both can speak freely and honestly with the psychiatrist or psychologist present.  Having and raising kids is not easy, especially when one or both have to travel for work.  Is there someone in the family who would be willing to stay and help your wife while you travel?  I was fortunate to have my SIL and my parents around when my husband would travel for several weeks at a time.", "NTA because she has, as per OP'S comment, one weekend a month where he takes care of the baby and she's free to do whatever she likes.

She needs to suck it up and stop whining.", "NTA. The only gaslighting happening is from her.

However, it's a work trip which ultimately is to make income to provide for your family.\n\nI think you guys need to have some open communication here and figure out what the bigger issue is here.", "NTA but your wife is for not saying what she is really feeling about these trips. She says its fine and then makes snide remarks about them. You are damned if you do and damned if you dont.

Those aren't even long trips.

The problem is if your work requires these trips you are not doing your career any favours by turning them down.", "NTA, but I think there are some deeper issues that need to be worked through.

I hope you can get to the heart of the matter and talk about what's really bothering her.", "NTA I mean we are talking about 1 or 2 nights and it doesn't seem like it's even often so I hate to say it's really not a big deal.

Work trips are for work, not fun (for the most part, at least). Can you even realistically decline without it affecting your job performance? These trips are also not long.

Geez.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know what kind of work trips you go on, but in my world of work travel, other than a magnet or tshirt from the airport, the only thing my husband would be getting is a napkin or something from a restaurant (I never see matchbooks anymore). I\u2019m not doing any sort of fun activities where souvenirs would be involved.", "NTA, she sounds wildly depressed. She needs help with that and a bit of couples therapy to work on the resentment. She probably got burnt out and needs to know she's on a path forward.", "She is a confusing person but she should have known that there\u2019s a possibility of her being responsible for the child alone at some point. Not saying anything about leaving the relationship but God forbid you were completely out of touch anymore that child would still need a parent. Maybe she isn\u2019t mature enough for being a mother or partner because she\u2019s saying go and complains when you do and it\u2019s not a vacation, it\u2019s work!! And whining about no souvenir?? that\u2019s just nuts!!", "ESH\n\nI think she is just looking for some empathy from you and understanding when she explains how hard it was without you.

How about next weekend you plan a day all to yourself and I will take care of the baby all day.\"\n\nI do agree that the two of you could probably do with some couples counseling, as it seems like you do not communicate well.", "NTA. It sounds like she knows you should/need to go but she doesn't want you to go. Two conflicting feelings. She's angry at herself because of the conflicting feelings and she's defensive because of that.

I think what she\u2019s asking for is some space to complain, and a lot of gratitude and validation. The postpartum time is really hard for new parents. I\u2019m guessing the cycle is that you feel guilty if she complains, which in turn makes you defensive. You could gently let her know this, but also try to heap on the gratitude and validation. She\u2019s probably maxed out.", "NTA but I would seriously try to enlist help during these times so she's not alone. Maybe a part time nanny or a family member. \n\nRemember when she's alone with the baby, she is probably getting little to no sleep. Or maybe consider getting day care early.

How terrible it must be for her to parent her own child alone for an entire day \ud83d\ude44", "Yep. There are comments about him doing even more and maybe getting a nanny while he\u2019s gone. Guaranteed that she would then find something wrong with the nanny and complain about that, since she wouldn\u2019t be able to complain about being tired.", "According to another comment, she gets a weekend to herself every month to stay with a friend or in a hotel!", "Seems like SHE doesn't communicate at all. He's been bending over backwards to accommodate.", "This right here.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the trips it\u2019s you not acknowledging how hard she works while you\u2019re gone and maybe since she brought up a souvenir a small gift from the cities you travel to will go along way.", "This exactly. Respond to what she's actually saying instead of overreacting and invalidating her feelings. She wants to be thanked and she wants a little bit of emotional support for how tough it was for her. That merits a, \"thank you so much for doing this, I really appreciate you supporting my career and I'm lucky to have you. Is there anything we could do differently next time to make it easier for you?\"  \n\n Your response of, \"Okay I won't go again,\" is saying, \"I can't tolerate your complaining, stop.\" YTA", "Thank you, exactly my thoughts.\n\none could call the wife\u2018s behaviour a bit A, because she \u201efails\u201c to show clearly if she wants to vent or appeal to male problem-solving-ability", "\ud83d\ude02", "You can't base this whole problem solely on the fact he didn't bring home a souvenir, that's just unrealistic.

Give me a break. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like she enjoys the complaining and the dramatic \u201cI\u2019m so tired\u201d over and over. If OP did get her a nanny, she\u2019d find something wrong with the nanny so she could complain about that, if being tired was off the table.", "Yes. One weekend a month she goes to a hotel or a friend's house to get some time to herself.  To be clear, the other weekends we do things as a family.\n\nShe did turn down a work trip earlier in the summer though she only told me after so I do wonder if she expects me to do the same and not even ask her if it's okay.", "We have 1 sitter we trust who was not available.", "Wtf", "I agree, I need to be there more emotionally, I will work on it.

This is not a black and white or binary go/don\u2019t go issue, it is a given that if one parent is gone the remaining one will have more work, but there are things you could do before you go or when you get back to alleviate some of that. If you did some extra chores before or told her don\u2019t worry about this while I\u2019m gone I will take care of it when I return you might see a change in attitude.", "Also, stop going on work trips", "Sounds awful!

International trips that are short can be hell.  Between the increased stress of flying, changing airlines potentially halfway through because no carrier flies everywhere, multiple sets of customs/ security to navigate, jet lag, having to do long work days and also \u201csocial\u201d crap with your hosts who are sleeping in their own beds and not having their routine disrupted much while you\u2019re still on your own time zone, and dying for some rest, strange food, language barriers, culture barriers\u2026you need these trips to be longer to get to a point of feeling settled and relaxed in the new place\u2026short trips are hellacious.

There isn\u2019t sight seeing and fun \u201cnight life\u201d in my world.  There\u2019s missed events in your kids lives and the realization that shit, I didn\u2019t get a chance to call home before the kids are in bed because of time zone differences and operating in a brain fog from sleep deprivation.  \n\nMore often than not I\u2019d have traded with my spouse to be the one to stay home with the kiddos.  But kids are a lot of work, particularly those first few years, so, it\u2019s an adjustment for everyone.  Both spouses should be doing all they can to minimize the stress they place on one another and be grateful for the efforts of one another, and more communication and consideration is going to be required to make this work for OP.", "I hear you. I'm not sure how I didn't think of saying that. I definitely do appreciate her in my mind but need to vocalize these things.", "Sounds like you expect OP to be a mind-reader.  Men tend to look at the world in black and white tones...trip a problem, solution...no trip.  Could he have foreseen her needs better?  Perhaps.  That said...she could also have communicated her needs better.", "Whoosh!", "This! I\u2019m baffled at these comments that he could do more! He fills her car with gas, stocks up on groceries, ensures there are premade meals\u2026.What else is he supposed to do? Hire a maid to follow her around and pick up after her? Hire entertainment to keep them occupied and happy? If she can\u2019t take care of one child on her own for 24-48 hours with all that taken care of for her\u2026I\u2019m seriously side-eyeing her.", "Ok if she is also getting away (and for fun not work!)

If she can't forgive you and move forward as a team, then why are you together?", "Can you prioritize finding another?", "Because that puts the responsibility on her and she feels guilty because it is your job. YOU need to be the one assessing how important or optional each trip is, not her", "Why do you need her permission to turn down the trip? \n\nYou know she struggles when you're away. You know she turns town trips so you're not left to struggle on your own. \n\nYou know what she wants, so if that's not a problem for you, why aren't you just doing it?", "It's manipulation by even bringing it up if there. If he really didn't want to go and really didn't want his wife upset, he'd never bring it up. \n\nIt's like if I told my partner- I was invited to go do this thing, but I know you wouldn't like it if I went. My partner can't say no, because then when people ask why I'm not going, guess what I say? My partner didn't really want me to go. And now my partner is the bad person.  A partner/spouse or whatever,  never wants to be the reason someone doesn't do something.", "It's not manipulation, don't mind the comments. It's not pleasure trips, it's for work.

So you're taking care of the kids for 48 hours.. and you're adamant that you've been doing a 50/50 half the share of the chores and so forth when you're there as well...

She probably feels bad that it's hard. Most women are under the impression mums are meant to have super powers and deal with everything. She probably feels a bit jealous of your freedom but also guilty that shes jealous because we're meant to want to be with our kids 24/7. And you're so dam reasonable and logical that you can't even let her blow off steam, because as soon as she complains you go off being nice about it and then she feels stupid and selfish for complaining.\n\nMaking any sense?\n\nI would suggest trying a few things around validating her feelings, not just practical support. You could try to call or text more while she's away, saying things like you appreciate how tough it is being on all the time, that your just checking in on her to remind her she's a rock star and she deserves a break. When you get home you could organise a sitter for a couple of hours and like, just tell her to rant about every difficult moment, or scream, or throw a toddler tantrum (I recommend these they're super fun) - she's been putting on a face the whole time you've been gone, and will need to drop the mask. I saw in a comment that she already has had a few trips away, but maybe just offer them after you've been gone.

His wife is just a whiney twit.", "Im sure she'll be totally on board with that and find it an equitable solution", "It\u2019s been a year. If you can\u2019t work through the fact that things won\u2019t always be 50/50 in your marriage in a year then you need to divorce. His wife is, quite frankly, irrational.", "It kind of is though. He addresses early on that he is taking part of the mental load on too so clearly he has been told that being a SAHM is harder", "Reality", "Holy shit your wife is milking this! I worked from home with my son from birth. I never tried to guilt my husband like this. I then had twins who were also home with me while I worked. 3 toddlers at home & I didn't take weekends away. It's called parenting. She has you snowed. If she can't cope she needs some therapy.", "This is critical information you should add into your post. This turns it from \u201cshe\u2019s just frustrated\u201d to it looking more like she\u2019s purposefully beating you down and skewing your sense of what you \u201cshould\u201d do. You see how this is- she\u2019s creating a situation where you CAN\u2019T win. NTA, get counseling. Her behavior is manipulative.", "Your wife is living in a \"damn if you do, damn if you don't\" world. I would ask her a few questions, point blank:\n\n1. what do you want? That I go, or that I not go?\n2. What is the difference between me going away, and you going away?\n3. If you tell me to go, what can I do to make it easier on you?\n4. Will you do the same things for me when you go away?\n5. If we can't come up with answers that satisfy us both, would you agree to a few rounds of couples counselling, so we can learn how to communicate better?\n\nWe both started travelling for work again a year after our child was born. My husband looked after her when I'd go away, usually for a week, once for three weeks (!!!). (She was also in daycare). I did the same when he went on business trips; his were usually for a week. I'm the primary cook (he does breakfasts) so whenever I left, I would make big batches of freezable things so he could just nuke whatever; whenever he was gone, I'd happily make things for myself that he wouldn't like. Never at any time did it occur to either of us to resent the other for doing the things that came with our jobs, or doing the things that parents do for their kids. It CAN be done.", "Do you get a weekend away every month or is your business trip your only time away because this isn\u2019t looking equal this is looking like you now do equal amount of work, but she gets to guilt trip you into time off and you don\u2019t get any counseling, counselling counseling, please!", "When I read this, my immediate reaction was, I bet those weekends are less stressful and more pleasant for you than the other days of the month.", "I\u2019m sorry to ask, but with whom? That\u2019s also a lot more of a break than almost all other parents get! I think her issues have a different root.", "She is gone just as much if not more and when she goes away it's for fun. Unless I'm missing something or you left information out, your wife doesn't have a firm grasp on reality.\n\nI suggest talking to someone together so she can process her resentment but it's unreasonable that she get carte blanche to punish you indefinitely. \n\nResentment in a relationship is serious problem that needs to be nipped in the bud.", "When your wife goes away, do you know what she\u2019s actually doing?.. like do you know for sure\n\nI have a feeling she wants to both complain that you\u2019re not around to justify something \u2026 but when you try to make changes to appease her, she doesn\u2019t want you to do that\u2026 she needs that justification because whatever else she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t something that she should be doing when you\u2019re away..\n\nI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s entirely possible she seeing someone. It matches up with everything\u2026 hopefully it\u2019s not true but I would highly advise getting a hold of her phone one night when she\u2019s sleeping.\n\nI can\u2019t help but notice that she wants to complain, but she also doesn\u2019t want you to fix it .. it\u2019s like she wants to be able to say that you\u2019re not around to justify something\u2026 what is she trying to justify to herself?", "But there are no stay at home parents in this post\u2026", "This \u261d\ufe0f\u2026. I have three 10, 7 & 1 yr and currently pregnant. I work 40 hrs a week and so does my husband. We also have two dogs, five cats, a bunny and a hamster. We split everything 50/50. Yes it can be overwhelming but I would never guilt trip my husband for his business trips that are a week every other month. Neither of us get weekends away a month, he\u2019ll we havent been on vacation for over a year. I support the therapy idea because I think she is either having postpartum depression or she is holding onto anger she has been bottling up. We are NEVER prepared to be parents but have to learn how to juggle everything and still be happy. Your wife seems to not be happy and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s you, I think it\u2019s her. She needs to talk to someone and work out her issues and then communicate it all to you so you both are on the same page and can work together and not against each other. \n\nOne or two nights alone with her son shouldn\u2019t result in a fight and guilt tripping you for making money to keep your life going forward. Yet you can also show your support as suggested above with cleaning, cooking, shopping and making sure the car has gas. You guys need to learn to be a team.", "This needs to be higher up.", "Hotel is alone", "Wanting to be heard and vent does not equal putting your partner down, criticizing them for work obligations, criticizing when he turns down work obligations, etc etc. She\u2019s creating a situation where no matter what he does, it upsets her and she\u2019s lashing out at him. \n\nThat\u2019s not healthy , in the slightest \u2026. And goes way beyond the \u201cdo you want solutions or just want me to listen to you bitch and moan?\u201d.", "I agree, it's funny that the wife is claiming that OP is gaslighting her, while she is the one doing the gaslighting. Telling him to go, then being cold to him and making him feel like he did something wrong.\n\nHearing that she gets a weekend and spends the night out once a month, I hate to admit, but my first thoughts were the same. It feels like she is seeing someone. Maybe it's this newer generation, I don't understand staying away from home over night especially once every month.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm old so I barely got help from my husband when I had my children, and I don't understand women complaining about taking care of the house and child when they get to stay home. \n\nI had to do all that, and work. He wouldn't even change poopy diapers. When I worked on weekends, day care was closed, and he had to watch the baby, he would bring the baby to me at work to change a poopy butt. Hell he would even hand a tissue to the toddler to bring to me to wipe his nose, while I was doing dishes and had wet hands. \n\nOP NTA I feel like there is something more going on. You sound like a hands on dad and partner, I also agree with maybe some couples counseling.", "A great deal of this thread has been discussing the fact that the wife often goes to a hotel by herself or with a friend.", "When she was on mat leave she was a SAHM", "this. i was a military brat and my mom hated being a sahm. i don\u2019t think she ever got a weekend to herself, let alone once a month. my dad would be deployed for months at a time. he was a very active and engaged parent when he was home, but he just wasn\u2019t home most of the time. but she did it, because she loved my dad and supported his career and she loved me and my brothers. i don\u2019t really see what this woman has to complain about if he\u2019s doing 50/50 now and she gets a weekend to herself every single month. being a parent sucks, that\u2019s why i don\u2019t want to do it personally, but when you sign up for it, you sign up for it all. this is just what it means to be a parent. sucks to suck. she shouldn\u2019t have had children.", "I have a feeling she\u2019s using his time away as justification to do something that she\u2019s not proud of.\n\nIf he changes his schedule to appease her, she loses her justification for whatever she\u2019s doing .. which is why she didn\u2019t want him to change anything\u2026 there\u2019s a reason for that", "Feels like something weird is going on and she\u2019s trying to start fights saying he can go then being mad about it.
