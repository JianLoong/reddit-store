It'll be a hell of a lot harder if she keeps this up and drives you away from the family. Being a single parent isn't easy.", "NTA but you two definitely need couples counseling. You know you were wrong in some early decisions you made after going back to work so you\u2019re willing to admit mistakes which then this behavior from your wife indicates to me that you two need couples counseling.

Sometimes for well over a week. He's leaving next week again  for 4 nights. It's easier to have him there but it's not \"worse\" when he's not there.

But she doesn't get to talk from two sides of her mouth to make you the bad guy.", "NTA but your wife could be harboring resentment or still suffering from post partum depression disorder.  Either way recommend individual and couples therapy.  It should be a safe environment where you both can speak freely and honestly with the psychiatrist or psychologist present.  Having and raising kids is not easy, especially when one or both have to travel for work.  Is there someone in the family who would be willing to stay and help your wife while you travel?  I was fortunate to have my SIL and my parents around when my husband would travel for several weeks at a time.", "NTA because she has, as per OP'S comment, one weekend a month where he takes care of the baby and she's free to do whatever she likes.

However, it's a work trip which ultimately is to make income to provide for your family.\n\nI think you guys need to have some open communication here and figure out what the bigger issue is here.", "NTA but your wife is for not saying what she is really feeling about these trips. She says its fine and then makes snide remarks about them. You are damned if you do and damned if you dont.

Those aren't even long trips.

The problem is if your work requires these trips you are not doing your career any favours by turning them down.", "NTA, but I think there are some deeper issues that need to be worked through.

I hope you can get to the heart of the matter and talk about what's really bothering her.", "NTA I mean we are talking about 1 or 2 nights and it doesn't seem like it's even often so I hate to say it's really not a big deal.

Work trips are for work, not fun (for the most part, at least). Can you even realistically decline without it affecting your job performance? These trips are also not long.

Geez.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know what kind of work trips you go on, but in my world of work travel, other than a magnet or tshirt from the airport, the only thing my husband would be getting is a napkin or something from a restaurant (I never see matchbooks anymore). I\u2019m not doing any sort of fun activities where souvenirs would be involved.", "NTA, she sounds wildly depressed. She needs help with that and a bit of couples therapy to work on the resentment. She probably got burnt out and needs to know she's on a path forward.", "She is a confusing person but she should have known that there\u2019s a possibility of her being responsible for the child alone at some point. Not saying anything about leaving the relationship but God forbid you were completely out of touch anymore that child would still need a parent. Maybe she isn\u2019t mature enough for being a mother or partner because she\u2019s saying go and complains when you do and it\u2019s not a vacation, it\u2019s work!! And whining about no souvenir?? that\u2019s just nuts!!", "ESH\n\nI think she is just looking for some empathy from you and understanding when she explains how hard it was without you.

How about next weekend you plan a day all to yourself and I will take care of the baby all day.\"\n\nI do agree that the two of you could probably do with some couples counseling, as it seems like you do not communicate well.", "NTA. It sounds like she knows you should/need to go but she doesn't want you to go. Two conflicting feelings. She's angry at herself because of the conflicting feelings and she's defensive because of that.

I think what she\u2019s asking for is some space to complain, and a lot of gratitude and validation. The postpartum time is really hard for new parents. I\u2019m guessing the cycle is that you feel guilty if she complains, which in turn makes you defensive. You could gently let her know this, but also try to heap on the gratitude and validation. She\u2019s probably maxed out.", "NTA but I would seriously try to enlist help during these times so she's not alone. Maybe a part time nanny or a family member. \n\nRemember when she's alone with the baby, she is probably getting little to no sleep. Or maybe consider getting day care early.

I have a full time job and my six year old\u2019s dad hasn\u2019t seen him for two years now. I also care for two cats, a rabbit, and my Dad and I\u2019m also a student. It\u2019s actually not that bad so I really don\u2019t understand OP\u2019s wife\u2019s problem.", "Oh look, here come the 'it's worse for me suck it up' crew out for their medals.", "Right? How terrible it must be for her to parent her own child alone for an entire day \ud83d\ude44", "Yep. There are comments about him doing even more and maybe getting a nanny while he\u2019s gone. Guaranteed that she would then find something wrong with the nanny and complain about that, since she wouldn\u2019t be able to complain about being tired.", "According to another comment, she gets a weekend to herself every month to stay with a friend or in a hotel!", "Seems like SHE doesn't communicate at all. He's been bending over backwards to accommodate.", "This right here.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the trips it\u2019s you not acknowledging how hard she works while you\u2019re gone and maybe since she brought up a souvenir a small gift from the cities you travel to will go along way.", "This exactly. Respond to what she's actually saying instead of overreacting and invalidating her feelings. She wants to be thanked and she wants a little bit of emotional support for how tough it was for her. That merits a, \"thank you so much for doing this, I really appreciate you supporting my career and I'm lucky to have you. Is there anything we could do differently next time to make it easier for you?\"  \n\n Your response of, \"Okay I won't go again,\" is saying, \"I can't tolerate your complaining, stop.\" YTA", "Thank you, exactly my thoughts.\n\none could call the wife\u2018s behaviour a bit A, because she \u201efails\u201c to show clearly if she wants to vent or appeal to male problem-solving-ability", "\ud83d\ude02", "You can't base this whole problem solely on the fact he didn't bring home a souvenir, that's just unrealistic. It's a work trip, not a vacation. You act like he's going to landmarks and sightseeing when he is going purely for work. This is much deeper than not bringing back a souvenir.", "The kid is nearly 2 years old. Not an infant. Really, she needs a nanny while her husband is gone for two days or she won\u2019t survive? Give me a break. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like she enjoys the complaining and the dramatic \u201cI\u2019m so tired\u201d over and over. If OP did get her a nanny, she\u2019d find something wrong with the nanny so she could complain about that, if being tired was off the table.", "Yes. One weekend a month she goes to a hotel or a friend's house to get some time to herself.  To be clear, the other weekends we do things as a family.\n\nShe did turn down a work trip earlier in the summer though she only told me after so I do wonder if she expects me to do the same and not even ask her if it's okay.", "We have 1 sitter we trust who was not available.", "Wtf", "I agree, I need to be there more emotionally, I will work on it. And noted on the souvenir too. I picked up a toy for our daughter at the airport but couldn't find anything my wife would like.", "I'm sorry but how is it manipulation? I'm genuinely asking because my thought process is \"While this trip is important, it's not a must and if you say no, I absolutely will not go\".", "Can I ask what you have done leading up to the trips to make things easier for your wife while you are gone? This is not a black and white or binary go/don\u2019t go issue, it is a given that if one parent is gone the remaining one will have more work, but there are things you could do before you go or when you get back to alleviate some of that. If you did some extra chores before or told her don\u2019t worry about this while I\u2019m gone I will take care of it when I return you might see a change in attitude.", "Also, stop going on work trips", "Sounds awful! What did your husband do to support you!?", "I think it\u2019s less \u201cwoe is me I have it harder\u201d and more \u201cdon\u2019t underestimate your capabilities\u201d. If some people can singular parent 24/7, it\u2019s more than possible to singular parent for a few days at a time.", "Also, it\u2019s hard for the spouse left behind to understand how grueling work trips *can* be.  International trips that are short can be hell.  Between the increased stress of flying, changing airlines potentially halfway through because no carrier flies everywhere, multiple sets of customs/ security to navigate, jet lag, having to do long work days and also \u201csocial\u201d crap with your hosts who are sleeping in their own beds and not having their routine disrupted much while you\u2019re still on your own time zone, and dying for some rest, strange food, language barriers, culture barriers\u2026you need these trips to be longer to get to a point of feeling settled and relaxed in the new place\u2026short trips are hellacious.  However longer trips obviously take a larger toll on the partner left behind.\n\nAnd the spouse at home is like \u201cI don\u2019t care what you went through, I had to do all this stuff for the family while you were away and only had to care for yourself.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been in both roles, and both are right.  And admittedly not ALL work trips are hellacious, but 95% of the ones I have been on, I\u2019m working far longer hours than at home and dealing with far more stress and far less sleep.  There isn\u2019t sight seeing and fun \u201cnight life\u201d in my world.  There\u2019s missed events in your kids lives and the realization that shit, I didn\u2019t get a chance to call home before the kids are in bed because of time zone differences and operating in a brain fog from sleep deprivation.  \n\nMore often than not I\u2019d have traded with my spouse to be the one to stay home with the kiddos.  But kids are a lot of work, particularly those first few years, so, it\u2019s an adjustment for everyone.  Both spouses should be doing all they can to minimize the stress they place on one another and be grateful for the efforts of one another, and more communication and consideration is going to be required to make this work for OP.", "I hear you. I'm not sure how I didn't think of saying that. I definitely do appreciate her in my mind but need to vocalize these things.", "Sounds like you expect OP to be a mind-reader.  Men tend to look at the world in black and white tones...trip a problem, solution...no trip.  Could he have foreseen her needs better?  Perhaps.  That said...she could also have communicated her needs better.", "Whoosh!", "This! I\u2019m baffled at these comments that he could do more! He fills her car with gas, stocks up on groceries, ensures there are premade meals\u2026.What else is he supposed to do? Hire a maid to follow her around and pick up after her? Hire entertainment to keep them occupied and happy? If she can\u2019t take care of one child on her own for 24-48 hours with all that taken care of for her\u2026I\u2019m seriously side-eyeing her.", "Ok if she is also getting away (and for fun not work!) I'm leaning towards her being more of the asshole, but I'm betting that this still stems from lingering resentment. Honestly, please consider couple's therapy. If she can't forgive you and move forward as a team, then why are you together?", "Can you prioritize finding another?", "Because that puts the responsibility on her and she feels guilty because it is your job. YOU need to be the one assessing how important or optional each trip is, not her", "Why do you need her permission to turn down the trip? \n\nYou know she struggles when you're away. You know she turns town trips so you're not left to struggle on your own. \n\nYou know what she wants, so if that's not a problem for you, why aren't you just doing it?", "It's manipulation by even bringing it up if there. If he really didn't want to go and really didn't want his wife upset, he'd never bring it up. \n\nIt's like if I told my partner- I was invited to go do this thing, but I know you wouldn't like it if I went. My partner can't say no, because then when people ask why I'm not going, guess what I say? My partner didn't really want me to go. And now my partner is the bad person.  A partner/spouse or whatever,  never wants to be the reason someone doesn't do something.", "It's not manipulation, don't mind the comments. It's not pleasure trips, it's for work. And if your wife wants to keep muddying the waters and confusing both herself and you in what she wants, then that's on her. \n\nYou're being open and direct, and she needs to figure out how to do that too.", "Made sure the car had gas, that we were stocked up on groceries, had a few meals prepped. I should ask if there's more she expects me to do.", "Perfectly said. Thank you for this.", "This is the thing that always pisses me off about the whole 'stay at home parents have so much mental load' with the obvious completion of 'and working parents don't.'\n\nYes, you have to remember schedules, friends names, birthday dates, play dates, extracurriculars, and so on.\n\nMeanwhile, the working parent has to do all that too, with the added difference that if they mess something up, it could impact livelyhood.\n\nHonestly, I found being a SAHD to three toddler daughters way more relaxing and chill than a standard office job.", "As long as you don't vocalize appreciation for your partner and their work and sacrifices, it externally appears the same way it would if you took their work and sacrifices for granted and didn't appreciate them at all.", "Let's not make it about gender. Emotionally immature people, maybe. No one I would date would give such a childish knee-jerk response. I do agree she could also communicate her needs better.", "Yes we do need a backup.", "But it's not a pleasure trip, it's for work. And she can be honest, rather than telling him one thing then getting mad when he does it. \n\nIf anyone is doing any manipulating here,nits OPs wife.", "I'm gonna say this gently. \n\nBut as someone else said already. You might want to do couples therapy. \n\nYou seem really caught up in feeling guilty for not helping out as much the first part while she was home with the baby. \nNow you are helping 50/50 with everything. \n\nYou are gone for a maximum of 2 days. \nMeal prep for her, stock up on groceries so she does not have to go. The car is filled. \nIf the house is clean before you leave. 1-2 days is not that much. \n\nYou both seem caught in a bad spiral. \nShe's guilting you for being gone. On business trips. Not fun trips. \nAnd you are caught up in the guilt and seem to \"I should apologise more,\" which she can take a bit of advantage of. Intentional or not. \n\nThis is not a reddit question. It should be a couple therapist question  \"how do we break out of this bad spiral\"", "Could you take the kid out for the day over a weekend or even book your wife into a local but very nice hotel for a night so she can have some time away and you'll be doing the solo parenting?\n\nIt sounds to me like she knows you need to go on these work trips (I assume refusing every single one could damage your career) but it's also bringing back a lot of memories of when you were leaving her to do almost everything around the house and that's sitting on the old resentment she felt.\n\nI know you're working on these trips and not getting a huge break, but you're still having a night away while she's doing all the dinner and bedtime routine alone. That's probably what's getting to her but she can't/won't say it because Mums aren't supposed to complain about that sort of thing.\n\nArranging for her to have an overnight break could help with this as then you're showing willing to take on that task alone. And by alone I mean without her supervision or even just having her within shouting distance.", "Not a lot of people would agree that those are extra chores, that really sounds like the barest minimum you could have done", "I mean if you think that is extra, I question that you are actually at 50/50 in normal times. You admit that you were slacking before, and have gotten better but I think you may have a little farther to go.", "No, dont ask. Figure it out on your own. Mental load is exhausting", "OPs wife also works, so they're not just a SAHM.", "Invalidating", "It's definitely possible.  For the last few months, she's been taking a weekend away each month to a friend's house or a hotel nearby.", "I agree it's not extra. I didn't read the entire comment about asking what extra I did, I thought they were just asking what I did. I will speak with her about this.", "As opposed to what? Hiring the robot maid from the Jetsons?", "I didn't say it's extra? It's the bare minimum I could do. And she's out all day today with friends.\n\nEdit: I didn't read all the way through and thought you were just asking what I did. I'll speak with her about what extra she would like for me to do to make it easier if there's a next time.", "A weekend away each month?  And you are getting attitude for occasional work trips?  Look, I\u2019m a mom of four, including a special needs son and my husband often travelled for work.  Your wife has to look after one two year old for a night or two and you get attitude? Honestly, that\u2019s ridiculous to begin with, let alone considering she gets a free weekend every month.", "A weekend away each month?!!! I go out to dinner with girlfriends once every couple months and I feel like I'm pushing it. I'm usually always team mom in these situations but I think your wife is in the wrong here. NTA", "ok, so I really don't understand what's going on now.  She's had 3-4 weekend trips away where she's able to relax and have fun.. but you're getting a cold shoulder and guilt tripped over a 1 day work trip now, and a 2 day work trip sometime else in the past year?  So you're taking care of the kids for 48 hours.. and you're adamant that you've been doing a 50/50 half the share of the chores and so forth when you're there as well...   The two of you really need to go to couple's counselling.  Sit down and communicate because this really doesn't make sense to me that she's acting this way except as some sort of guilt trip to hold over your head what happened at first when you went back to work.  Also - just a thought.  Have the two of you had YOU time in the last half a year or so?  Left the baby with family or a sitter and just gone out the two of you, to have a date or something?  Maybe see if that's a possibility?  You're both having ME time, but not YOU time together.", "Also a strong possibility she just wants to speak and feel heard about how hard it was/ is alone. Like, she\u2019s not wanting a discussion in order to make a new plan/ changes she just wants acknowledgement. \n  \n  When my partner is speaking in frustration (with me/ work/ her sister or whatever) I often ask \u201cIs this a feelings conversation or a solutions conversation?\u201d\n  \n  \n  She tells me which and we continue the discussion so I can either empathise with her, focussing on how she felt through different moments/ complications, or we move past the feelings stage and start discussing what we/ she can do differently next time. \n  \n  New mums are often pressurised and heavily criticised by their families/ the media etc and regardless of how it\u2019s actually going, feel like a failure. Perhaps she\u2019s still holding on to a bit of resentment (as someone suggested above), perhaps she\u2019s re-triggered by your short absences, but perhaps she\u2019s also internalising that difficult period and feeling like a failure as a mum. \n  \n  What\u2019s her self-esteem like? Can you think of ways you could show her how proud you are of her as a brilliant mum? Maybe keep it separate from the moments you remind her she\u2019s beautiful/ sexy and that you love her, so she knows it\u2019s specifically about her as a parent?  \n  \n  Seems like this solo period may look over in practical terms, but maybe it has deeper emotional roots that aren\u2019t resolved yet.", "So she went back to work, started doing weekends away and gives you snark for going on short work trips? Sounds like she's projecting...", "As long as you take a proactive approach to this and actually take the time and energy yourself to do things for your family it should be better.

How will you know when you have achieved 50/50? It\u2019s an impossible goal. Young children by default depend on their mothers more in the early years. After all you can\u2019t go 50/50 in growing, birthing & breastfeeding a baby. She\u2019s telling you to go, and not to stay home, telling you that she will be fine & then uses your leaving to guilt trip you? I don\u2019t think that is fair or mature. She should agree for you to stay if she wants you to stay and help her. Definitely sensing resentment & possibly abandonment issues?

You then answered with the bare minimum and that you will ask her what she expects you to do.

That meant I had to plan for my two children and take care of my own responsibilities. It couldn\u2019t be helped.

After all you can\u2019t go 50/50 in growing, birthing & breastfeeding a baby.\n\nThat's not entirely true. The only potentially relevant thing after the child is born is the breastfeeding because the growing and birthing is already done obviously. There's a lot that is not breastfeeding-related that men can do to make up for the dysbalance. In addition, some women don't breastfeed at all or not for very long, which leaves zero real reason why women should do most for all of \"the early years\".", "That's fair, I'll work on it.", "> Also don\u2019t see what her being out with friends has to do with anything.\n\nIt doesn't at all.

She's getting stress-free baby time, he isn't.", "Boo bloody hoo", "Men can, technically speaking, lactate. They have all the parts. They don't typically produce enough of the right hormones- but that's (theoretically) an easy enough fix.", "As an old man who came within a whisker of divorce because I thought I was doing more than I actually was, I\u2019m not judging you.", "Generally I disagree with the attitude that the one who works \u201cgets time away from the kids\u201d so the one who is home gets to go out with friends or take vacations whe the working one stays home.
