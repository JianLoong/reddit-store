He can't do laundry, he can't cook, he can't clean, can't fix anything. He dropped from school at 18 because of depression and he hasn't done anything in his life since. Now at 25 he finally found a job and my parents have gone bonkers. They make his little lunch box, washes his clothes, cooks everything for him and clean his room. But it's not like he just can't do it, it's that my parents never taught him, NEVER. For the past years that he hasn't worked or studied a minute, I've been doing everything, I cook most days, I'm the only one cleaning the house, I fix wires and shit, I study and go to school and I even have a side job. They expect me to do all those things, they just take it for granted. They never prepared me a lunchbox or cleaned my room. \n\nNowz the other day I was talking to my parents and I told them that they need to stop pampering him. I told them he needs to grow up and that one day, when they're going to die (not so far away sadly), he's going to be in great difficulty. If no one cooks for him, he'll just eat bought biscuits for dinner. He can't sustain himself this way. \n\nApart from having that concern for his future, I need to admit that I am mad at this. Why do we get treated so differently? Why after 8 hours outside the house, at 16, do I need to come back and cook for him??? And I get shouted at if I don't (happened way before he got a job, since i was 15).\n\nI never thought that I came from a conservative family or something, my parents ar far left and for the freedom of everyone... So why do I feel like this has to do with him being a man?? Or maybe they're just attached to their first born... Idk... What do I do? Am I even right or an asshole for pointing out??", "created_utc": 1701345983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187h0lq/aita_for_criticizing_so_harshly_my_brother_and_my/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But stop doing so much housework. Keep your own room clean and the bathroom but let them wallow in their filth. \n\nAs for cooking, can you just make food for yourself? Or start making super simple meals with the excuse of \u201cI have to study\u201d. \n\nAre you going to be able to attend a university or some kind of trade/job training school after high school?  That could be a chance to move out or to get you set up with an income to eventually get away.", "People get used to how things are. Stop cooking for everyone . Take a sheet of paper and put cooking schedule on top put one name for every weekday and then Friday people are on their own. Don\u2019t cook if it\u2019s not your day", "They told me to shut up. They don't hide it tho, they even joke about it", "Italian... I guess we have something in common. But tbh I don't know if it's common here. We're traditionalists so maybe yeah", "I don't know where you are from but where I'm from that's not a thing. People move out around 30 here (I live in Italy).

They taught me but not him?? It's not like I'm just healthier than him mentally and so they pamper him. I'm depressed and I go to the therapist. Mine is survival at this point. They've always neglected me, they brought him to a psychiatrist when he had problems but they always refused for me, saying I was going to be ok, till the point I almost threw myself from a window.

I'll have to suffer through it I guess", "I know it might be cultural, it sounds that way. In the US, many people move out when they finish high school (if they can afford it). It isn\u2019t always better and sometimes they move back in with their parents, but having some independence changes the dynamic and the expectation. If you move away for university, you can stop by to cook and clean.\n\nSadly, this isn\u2019t about respect and gender. You shouldn\u2019t let culture and tradition over rule your self worth and how your family values you. \n\nIf something happens to them, so they expect you to take care of him or some poor girl gullible enough to marry him.\n\nIt\u2019s not your circus, not your monkeys any more. Focus on your education and save money to move out. You are a strong and very capable person, and you can move out and take care of yourself.", "It\u2019s very common for parents to get a lot of the parenting bit wrong with the firstborn child. The reason you were taught things is precisely because they learned the value of teaching these things through the experience \u2014 and the fallout \u2014 of not having done it the first time around. They likely view you as fundamentally stronger and more capable. To hear you tell it, despite your issues, you definitely seem to be. I strongly doubt they prefer him the way it feels like they do. Do not let this derail you. Please don\u2019t do that. Your feelings are valid and understandable. But your perspective on this may one day change in ways that surprise you.", "Do not feel embarrassed as a plumber would see the owner of the house, your parents, as the responsible ones.  Get a lock for your bedroom door, keep it clean as your sanctuary and stop doing all the work.  They may take the hint, they may not, but it is time for all three of them to act like adults.", "I can't wait to move out but I don't see that happening any time soon. I'm just at the fourth year of high school (we have five), so two years left. My side job pays nothing and statistically, here where I live people leave the house around 30. So you get that it's a bit complicated", "I\u2019m sorry it might take some time. If your grades are good, look at some American universities and smaller colleges (colleges in the US are university level). Many are old and have scholarships and busaries that international students can apply for. Many, just look at income of the family or if someone plays a sport. The US has two national exams (SAT & ACT) that most universities use and they look at your grades and class rank too. You might find the US exams to be easier than your home country exams."]}
