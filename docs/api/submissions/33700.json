My brother (32M) offered his second room for us to stay in instead of a hotel. So we agreed. \n\nCome time to stay, we arrive and the place is dirty. Christmas tree is covered in cat piss, floor turns your feet black and sticky if you don\u2019t wear socks or shoes, and the whole family is coming over for Christmas to his place to celebrate. \n\nSo I go out and buy some cleaning supplies so that I can clean the place up. Brother hasn\u2019t said anything to me but apparently has complained to my mom about me \u2018assuming\u2019 things. One of these things is that I\u2019d be able to use his car to get around because she said I would and she forgot to ask him. She admitted that was her fault and apologized to both of us.\n\nNow I might be sensitive but I\u2019m getting vibes from my brother that he\u2019s annoyed with me. I haven\u2019t said anything to him about it being dirty, but I said I would help get things ready for Christmas Day - like decorating the tree (after which discovering it was soaked in piss we threw out and got something else to put up). \n\nAITA for getting a bunch of cleaning stuff and cleaning up his place without asking? Should I tell him that I am uncomfortable with how dirty the place is and I just want to clean it so I can spend the holidays comfortable with my family? Should I not have told my mom about my complaints of the cleanliness as they\u2019d find out about it on Christmas Day? Would I be an asshole if I got a hotel room for the stay?\n\nEDIT: \nQuick update for anyone wondering: the tree was my moms she was storing there but no one told him we were throwing it out until it was happening and I felt really awkward about it ", "created_utc": 1703392263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pnguw/aita_for_wanting_to_clean_my_brothers_place_while/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it seems like an obviously good thing, they might worry that you'll move their stuff, use scents they don't like, make the place feel less like home, etc. Or they might just feel insulted or that you overstepped.\n\nIt would be totally reasonable to say something like \"Hey, would it be alright if I cleaned up some? If there's anything you don't want me to touch just let me know, but I'd love to help out in return for you letting me stay here! And honestly I'd be more comfortable if I cleaned - since I like to walk around barefoot, I can be a bit particular about the floors.\" Notice how I framed the cleaning as a favor, and the want for cleanliness as a quirk about you, so that it comes off way less insulting than if you said something like \"this place is filthy, I can't live like this.\" (Unfortunately, just cleaning without asking or saying anything about it may come off as a passive-aggressive version of the insult, especially if the person is already feeling self-conscious about the mess.) And he's more likely to agree to and appreciate the cleaning if he doesn't feel insulted.\n\nIt would also be reasonable for you to go stay at a hotel! Especially if you offer to clean and he refuses. He doesn't have to live at your standards, but you don't have to live at his either!", "nta for cleaning, but i don\u2019t know about throwing out his tree or any of his stuff for that matter. speaking from experience, i\u2019ve been in your shoes before! even if its gross, some people don\u2019t care and rather keep stuff that we might consider trash, or they become offended/embarrassed.", "Not the asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
