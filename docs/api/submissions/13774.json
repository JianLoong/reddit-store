I said no biggie and asked my family if we could go out the next day (today) and they all agreed. I made it clear to them that I wanted to go around 3 or 4 pm since my bedtime is 8 pm because I have to be up at 3 am for work and they said okay. I got home from work at around 2:30 pm and realized my dad wasn\u2019t home so I gave him a call to see what\u2019s up. Turns out he picked up a job since he had nothing to do today. Mind you he works in landscaping so his little \u201cside job\u201d would take hours to complete. I reminded him of my birthday dinner and he said to reschedule for a later time since he wasn\u2019t close to finishing at all so we changed it to 6 pm. 6pm rolls around and he\u2019s still not home. 7 pm and still nothing. At this point I head to bed early, assuming the plans were off because he wasn\u2019t answering my texts. At around 8:30 pm I get woken up and told that everyone is now ready to go and they just have to wait on me to get ready. I tell them I don\u2019t want to go at this time for 3 reasons. 1. i should be in bed sleeping since i have to be up early 2. my dad picked up a job knowing we had agreed to go early so i felt like he didn\u2019t respect the time we had agreed to 3. they didn\u2019t bother asking me if i still wanted to go they just woke me up and told me to get ready. So now everyone\u2019s mad at me for throwing a tantrum and ruining dinner. Everyone was ganging up on me and calling me ridiculous when the restaurant is still open for 2 more hours so I ended up crying and going off to bed. Now i\u2019m thinking maybe I should have sucked it up and gone anyway since they did get all dressed up only for me to say no so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680407910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129998d/aita_for_not_going_to_my_own_birthday_dinner/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
