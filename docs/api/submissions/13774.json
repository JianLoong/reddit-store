I said no biggie and asked my family if we could go out the next day (today) and they all agreed. I made it clear to them that I wanted to go around 3 or 4 pm since my bedtime is 8 pm because I have to be up at 3 am for work and they said okay. I got home from work at around 2:30 pm and realized my dad wasn\u2019t home so I gave him a call to see what\u2019s up. Turns out he picked up a job since he had nothing to do today. Mind you he works in landscaping so his little \u201cside job\u201d would take hours to complete. I reminded him of my birthday dinner and he said to reschedule for a later time since he wasn\u2019t close to finishing at all so we changed it to 6 pm. 6pm rolls around and he\u2019s still not home. 7 pm and still nothing. At this point I head to bed early, assuming the plans were off because he wasn\u2019t answering my texts. At around 8:30 pm I get woken up and told that everyone is now ready to go and they just have to wait on me to get ready. I tell them I don\u2019t want to go at this time for 3 reasons. 1. i should be in bed sleeping since i have to be up early 2. my dad picked up a job knowing we had agreed to go early so i felt like he didn\u2019t respect the time we had agreed to 3. they didn\u2019t bother asking me if i still wanted to go they just woke me up and told me to get ready. So now everyone\u2019s mad at me for throwing a tantrum and ruining dinner. Everyone was ganging up on me and calling me ridiculous when the restaurant is still open for 2 more hours so I ended up crying and going off to bed. Now i\u2019m thinking maybe I should have sucked it up and gone anyway since they did get all dressed up only for me to say no so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680407910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129998d/aita_for_not_going_to_my_own_birthday_dinner/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There where countless times I'd have to miss out on sleep or even skip whole day/nights just to be able to see people or not miss an important event. Shift work is ass.", "Same, I wouldn't have gone either, they should have made it for within the time she asked. I just meant OP could have still gone if she wanted to.\n\nI can see the way I worded it wasn't the best choice, sounds like I'm saying OP should have gone.", "NTA.

I hate it when people do this. It\u2019s your birthday, so they want to inconvenience YOU? They should arrange a different day.", "Absolutely spot on. NTA for all those reasons. \n\nIronic when people having a tantrum accuse calm people of having tantrums. \n\nOP, the only thing you did wrong was to pick up your phone after going to sleep. Happy belated birthday from a stranger on the internet who wishes you well as you continue to uphold your very reasonable boundaries with very unreasonable people.", "Seeing as the family think it's ok to reschedule hours later and interrupt sleep time,\n\nOP should wake them all up at 2am for a \"Birthday Breakfast\" before work.", "And wait for the father. They should have just gone to dinner without him and he could have joined at some point.

Then go knocking on doors asking if they want a slice of cake."]}
