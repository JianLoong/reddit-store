I said no biggie and asked my family if we could go out the next day (today) and they all agreed. I made it clear to them that I wanted to go around 3 or 4 pm since my bedtime is 8 pm because I have to be up at 3 am for work and they said okay. I got home from work at around 2:30 pm and realized my dad wasn\u2019t home so I gave him a call to see what\u2019s up. Turns out he picked up a job since he had nothing to do today. Mind you he works in landscaping so his little \u201cside job\u201d would take hours to complete. I reminded him of my birthday dinner and he said to reschedule for a later time since he wasn\u2019t close to finishing at all so we changed it to 6 pm. 6pm rolls around and he\u2019s still not home. 7 pm and still nothing. At this point I head to bed early, assuming the plans were off because he wasn\u2019t answering my texts. At around 8:30 pm I get woken up and told that everyone is now ready to go and they just have to wait on me to get ready. I tell them I don\u2019t want to go at this time for 3 reasons. 1. i should be in bed sleeping since i have to be up early 2. my dad picked up a job knowing we had agreed to go early so i felt like he didn\u2019t respect the time we had agreed to 3. they didn\u2019t bother asking me if i still wanted to go they just woke me up and told me to get ready. So now everyone\u2019s mad at me for throwing a tantrum and ruining dinner. Everyone was ganging up on me and calling me ridiculous when the restaurant is still open for 2 more hours so I ended up crying and going off to bed.

You made plans that your family agreed to, you called your family to remind them, and even after your father forgot about the whole thing you offered a compromise of a later time he agreed to. You did everything in your power to get your family to celebrate your birthday. Your family decided to be selfish and inconsiderate especially your father. He has no excuse for his behavior. Even if your father did forget your birthday despite multiple reminders he has no excuse for not telling you he'll be late and unable to make it in time. He could have easily been an adult and called or texted you to apologize for forgetting your birthday dinner and told you he won't be on time so reschedule or have it without him. Your family owes you some serious apologies. And if anyone in your family says any about you being selfish or throwing a tantrum tell the to shove it up their butts. Because you are the only one acting like an adult in the situation. Seriously you made plans for a reasonable time, you planned on going to bed early to ensure you have enough sleep to work early in the morning, and you communicated to your family the entire time trying to reach compromise and keep everyone informed of changes. Also happy belated birthday OP know the internet strangers of reddit agree you are NTA and hope you have the most wonderful makeup makeup birthday dinner. And OP don't worry about you inconsiderate family, just wait for your revenge. When it's your families birthdays you can treat them just as terrible as they treated you, especially your father. For his next birthday make sure you are working most of the day and when your father ask if you forgot his birthday just tell him you had nothing to do that day and walk off and drop the mic.

Why didn't they complain when your birthday was missed because everyone couldn't be there?  Now that you can't be there, they're complaining that their dinner is ruined, but no mention of it being the father's fault, who decided to do the job at the last minute.

OP, this is the way to deal with disrespect from family.\n\nTake this gold, as I don't have any other \ud83c\udfc6", "This is better than being noisy because then he can frame it as doing something nice as an apology before heading off to work. \ud83d\ude04", "Yeah I'll edit sorry. NTA", "That's hilarious!! Thankfully he got the message the first time lol", "NTA, your dad is selfish and rude. \n\nI know the type, my best friend is like your dad, constantly picking up little jobs here and there and helping out people here and there which is fine in itself but because he's doing that he's always, always, always neglecting the other engagements he has committed his time to on that day.\n\nAs a result, I'm pretty sick and tired of agreeing to hang out with him at a certain time on a Saturday only to have him be one to three hours late and then hang out for like 2 hours before he gets tired and leaves.\n\nSo I just quit calling him to hang out, I got better things to do than wait around for someone who's clearly not prioritizing me.", "NTA you had a specific time set and they didn\u2019t respect it or you. Fuck them quite honestly, don\u2019t let them make you feel bad for shit that isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA, happy birthday!!", "NTA but your family are! Let them all go to dinner if they\u2019ve gotten dressed up, you go to bed and have a lovely sleep and next time go to dinner with your friends who have some respect for your schedule!", "NTA.  You get up at 3am for work. You don't owe anyone an apology.", "NTA.  You weren't the priority for your birthday dinner.  Your father could have said  \"no\" to picking up the last-minute job which ruined plans OR he could have likely done it another day.  You were flexible and adjusted day/time ... but 4.5 hours later was unrealistic.   You were tired, disappointed, and you did not ruin dinner by declining to go.  Tantrum?  No worries, you were completely disrespected and they still could have gone to dinner without you.  Next year, go out with a friend for your birthday.  Your family aren't that thoughtful.", "NTA", "NTA I would send them all a F U message and go to sleep. Ignore them. Tell them if they continue the crap you will go NC on them. Be stern and Happy Birthday!", "NTA.", "NTA", "As someone who has had similar issues with family and my bday, I get this. If they can't make space for you on ONE day, that sucks.\n\nYou are NTA. Their gas lighting is what they are doing because they don't respect your request.", "NTA\n\nThat was a blatant demonstration of disrespect by everyone else involved.", "NTA. \u201cReady for dinner? Oh I already had my birthday dinner\u2014at 4pm when I told you I needed to it so I could get some sleep before my 3am wake-up time. Sorry you missed it, maybe next year!\u201d", "Wake them all up at 3 am and tell them it's time for birthday breakfast.  You expect eggs, waffles, French toast, whatever your little heart desires after all the kitchen is always open.", "Exactly!! \n\nOP's reasoning is very sound, perfectly logical. \n\nOP's birthday meant nothing for his father, as he literally described it as \"nothing to do\". Then they woke up OP knowing that OP had to be at work at 3 AM... WTF?! ... and now them being angry at OP just leaves me speechless... \n\nOP, NTA. Your family suck though.", "I first read that as, \"convenient to the U.S.,\" which might have been less inconvenient.", "Not even a work commitment. It was a pick-up job he didn\u2019t have to take if he didn\u2019t want to.", "I\u2019ve noticed that too about \u201cmorning people.\u201d  I normally fall asleep around 1-2 am because that\u2019s when I naturally get sleepy and people get irrationally upset about it.", "I feel dad was 'showing who's in charge' and it backfired on him.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Bot comment", "Wake them up for birthday breakfast tomorrow when you get up."]}
