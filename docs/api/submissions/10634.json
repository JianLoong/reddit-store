She should have just said, \"This was HIS idea,\" rolled her eyes, and then winked at you because she knew the thing was there beforehand and didn't bring it up before so must not have been that mad about it lol. Unless she didn't know? But still, seems like a weird overreaction. \n\nUnless you have a habit of giving her carte blanche and then complaining/changing things on the back end?

In a house things needs to be safe and practical, beauty comes after unless you are an eccentric millionaire that can do what you want financially (and it still needs to be safe!).

That'll always lead to resentment and problems. She completely ignored you saying that you thought ONE of her choices wasn't functional, while being fine with the rest, that's just controlling. \n\n\nWas this gadget actually noticeable enough that everyone pointed it out? Or did you point it out to people? It seems like it was quite noticeable.", "Beautiful but non functional. I will never understand the desire some have for that.

Sounds awesome.", "You didn't make the bathroom look cheap, you made it functional.  One of the central elements of home design is to make the *use* of it frictionless, or invisible to the user.  It all just works like its supposed to.  The faucets are a violation of that design principle. Even more important, there are dozens of high end faucets that would have been beautiful and worked better.  You told her you didn't like the faucets.  She proceeded anyhow.  Not only isn't she a fabulous bathroom designer, she's not a caring spouse that listens to your feedback.  NTA", "NTA - As a person who used to sell those faucets I can attest to the fact that they are just god awful when it comes to function.

Would your wife be happier if you were constantly making a wet mess on the counter?", "NTA and I would point out that her 'classy design' (air quotes and all) was a great way to make an absolute mess and encourage mold growth all through the vanity, which is what my 'cheap plastic trinket' is helping to prevent.", "NTA. you communicated the issue in advance; your remedy solves it. please pay the swivel arm picture / purchasing link tax!! really curious!", "NTA.

I am sorry to say that your wife is a AH (although small one) in this instance on deciding to purchase based on \"beauty\" and not take in functionality.  Having water over the counter when showing off looks like you skipped steps in the remodel just to make it look nice which in my opinion is much worse than a plastic attachment.  Free standing water usually indicates a plumbing issue and in a new remodel a job that wasn't done or done in a half ass manner.  Now go find other faucets that both look good AND are functional that you and your wife like.", "It sounds like she picked out faucets that are meant to go with vessel sinks, rather than surface-mounted or under-mounted sinks. NTA for making it work for you.", "NTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t use your bathroom, it\u2019s not a bathroom", "NTA", "NTA. A bathroom needs to be functionnal first.

The function of the object is a bit more important than how it looks. Jesus what a stupid thing to be mad about.", "NTA. Marriage is about compromises. If it helps you to be able to wash your hands then no harm done. She should have been proud that you figured out a solution for yourself. If my husband did that, I would have bragged about it and made little jokes to him even because that's how we are. We turn pretty much everything into a joke and laugh about it. If it bothered me to use it then I wouldn't use it myself but I'd definitely leave it alone for him to use. I don't understand what your wife's problem is. That just seems childish imo.", "ESH what fucking boomer nonsense is this", "YTA, you should be giving your wife all of the money to control as she pleases anyways", "YTA. That sounds ugly.  You shouldn\u2019t have put the entire design process on her.  If you had participated, you\u2019d have had veto power.  \n\n\u2018Do whatever you want, I don\u2019t have opinions\u2019 is never a great approach, because everyone has opinions.\n\nA better solution now would be returning or reselling the faucets and picking new ones together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
