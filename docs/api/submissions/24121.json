The clothing was blah and expensive, the whole vibe just screamed my mom and did not reflect either of our aesthetics at all. We had to nix a first dance because of her conservative parents. We nixed a huppah or dancing the horah because her parents were weird about me being Jewish. We had to nix having more alcohol, hosting a reception at night, and having a DJ that would play music I actually liked because of how many children we were convinced to let come.
