Looking back, I should have just eloped with my wife or had a small traditional Jewish wedding like we wanted to. We spent like $10,000 on an admittedly small wedding that we did not really get much of a say in because it was all for our families, not us. The whole thing was so stressful. The clothing was blah and expensive, the whole vibe just screamed my mom and did not reflect either of our aesthetics at all. We had to nix a first dance because of her conservative parents. We nixed a huppah or dancing the horah because her parents were weird about me being Jewish. We had to nix having more alcohol, hosting a reception at night, and having a DJ that would play music I actually liked because of how many children we were convinced to let come. In the end, we got such a blah nondenominational wedding that pleased everyone but ourselves.\n\nDon't do what I did.

You have a right to set the foundation of that new family with the event and day you would love to have and that would feel most celebratory to you. \n\nMy friend handled this with both her and her in-laws family by telling them they will be planning their own event but would like to ask close family what is most important for them on that day- one thing. And that one thing will be strongly considered. My friends MIL said that she and her son do a traditional dance that each mother and son had done in her family for years prior, her husbands grandma said a special vale. This allowed everyone to feel respected and included.
