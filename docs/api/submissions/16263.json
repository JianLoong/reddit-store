It\u2019s hard enough coming forward with trauma without having to defend yourself in a heated argument for hours and she may just not have been able to keep fighting. Either way, I think you should go see her. You won\u2019t regret seeing her once she\u2019s gone, but you might regret it if you don\u2019t. You are very young.

I don't think satisfaction is really an emotion she'll be dealing with.\n\nIf you don't want to forgive her for a joke (admittedly awful) she made as a teenager and are happy for her to die without maybe apologising for it or whatever else she may want - yes, YTA. grow up.", "Just going to echo this, if the 'lie' was otherwise out of character for her, it seems pretty plausible to me that someone (especially a 17 year old) could disclose abuse, then see how upset everyone is getting over it, watch her family argue for hours, potentially even be threatened when you couldn't see it, and feel panicked and scared and lie and say that she made up the disclosure.\n\nAre you sure that was a lie? What was the nature of it?", "YTA I dont think I can express how disgusting it was for you to say that bit throwing away her meds. I dont think I will change your mind but if we were friends and you said all this to me I would not talk to you ever again.", "How sure are you that she was \"joking\"? Maybe the abuse was real. Then under hours of mental strain because of \"arguing about it\", she just lied that it was a joke to escape the situation. \nYTA", "Soft YTA. You don't have to forgive her. She just wants to see you, and someone dying at 20 isn't thinking of satisfaction or any of that bullshit. You were significant to her for a large portion of her life and she'd like to say goodbye. As another autistic person, people are calling you cold because you sound incredibly cold and caught up in thoughts of righteous justice and revenge (and ngl, from my perspective a shitty teenage joke is not worth ignoring a dying wish) and are ignoring the reality that this is a young person who is dying and will be gone soon. Seeing her is a final kindness and the joke will not matter in two weeks, because she'll be dead.", "YTA\n\nYour cousin didn't do anything to you. \n\n>A few hours of arguing with my family later, and she admits the whole thing is a joke, and she thought it was funny.\n\nMaybe she was immature and said something stupid or maybe she just got tired of arguing and said it was a joke to be done with it?

She lied and coukd have significantly damaged your relationship with family members. You don't need to forgive her for that.", "Sometimes people make accusations that are directed wrongly. Like, it's not safe to say that their abuser is hurting them, so they say that a different person is abusing them.

For this reason, YTA.", "YTA on so many unbelievable levels. I honestly regret reading this post. You make me sick. \n\nThis is a woman who is dying and in her deathbed asking for someone who she was close with because her own mother despises her. Instead of being an adult you basically act like your taking the high road when instead your doing her dirty.\n\nNot to mention its possible it was a joke its also possible she was being abused. Instead of asking what was happening you apparently caused her to shut down. Bravo my friend bravo. Your disgusting.", "I\u2019d only say YTA for being so hateful towards your cousin still. You have every right to not see them but holding onto anger like this isn\u2019t good for you - people do stupid shit all the time and if you stay mad it\u2019ll suck your soul dry.", "YTA You're not forgiving your cousin over a joke she did when she was a teenager? Now you're happily refusing to see her during her last days? Which one of you is the more terrible one? Look in the mirror and find out. You need to grow up and look beyond yourself. It's time to leave the past in the past and go see your cousin. Think how you would feel if the tables were turned around which one day might be. You never know what life will throw at you.", "YTA. I\u2019m not even sure it _was_ a joke. I think she just cracked from all the arguments and said it was a joke to end the row.", "YTA.

You need to believe what she initially said, be kinder, and go visit your poor cousin.

There\u2019s a chance she was abused and just couldn\u2019t take the ranting and yelling.\n\nAlso, wanting to hide her meds and literally kill her is pure evil.

The more you do and let shit bounce off you, the better you\u2019ll be. I would even bring this up when I got there, if it bothers you so much. Get it out the way.

People like her don't deserve forgiveness or their apology accepted. You don't owe her shit because she's dying. My cousin made false accusations that my uncle was beating her because he wouldn't give her money. Turned almost all the family against accept my mom, her sisters, brother, & I. The last thing my uncle said to his daughter was that he was sorry. He shot himself, I'll never forget how hard she cried. Last ime I saw her was when my grandma slapped the shit out of her in front of all the family because of her lies.

Be the bigger person. Trust me you will think back on this and you will regret it. I hate the cliches but it fits just be the bigger person.

You might be surprised to hear that after all that, it was never a joke, and you were actually part of the problem.", "The joke was in poor taste. It was a lie about a family member that had others thinking of said family member in a bad light, which isn\u2019t something they deserve. \n\nI said OP could look at it that way\u2026.not that they had to.\n\nOh and getting sick and dying can easily be a punishment from the universe depending on what you\u2019ve done in your life.", "Thats a stupid thing to believe.
