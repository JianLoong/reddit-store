And I really hope a person that has endured abuse NEVER crosses paths with someone as heartless as you.\n\nYTA YTA YTA YTA", "Hey OP, things are getting intense here so I want to take a second to point out some stuff a little more gently and directly than others have. \n\nI'm AuDHD, so I get the extreme sense of justice and unwillingness to just let it go. That makes a huge amount of sense to me and I've carried feelings like that many times in my life. In the moment she said it was a joke, I can imagine that all feelings of connection to her disappeared in an instant and she became a different person to you. That's happened to me more times than I can count. Losing respect for a person instantly dissolves my feelings for them. It's jarring. \n\nI'm in my 30s and I've seen it play out enough times now to know some extra stuff. As others have pointed out, there's a strong possibility (to me it's more probable) that she caved under family pressure and said it was a joke to avoid continuing the confrontation. Lying like that isn't something that occurs to us so it can seem impossible but it's very common for allistic people to default to lying to protect themselves. So know that there's a not zero chance that the lie she told you was that it was a joke, not that the abuse happened. \n\nBecause of the way our brains work, we're susceptible to gaslighting by allistic people. We're more likely to be abused, less likely to recognise it. Abusers tend to be charming and appear wonderful to everyone except their victims - it's how they get to keep finding victims, by being accepted by groups. Your Grandma's sister may appear kind and sweet and she may have never shown you the side of her that's willing and capable of abusing her grandchild. You weren't the target, so you got the masked version of her. \n\nYou reacted by doing what you thought you were meant to do - get an adult. The thing is, you got a grown up who had a vested interest in these claims not being believed. They would have said anything to undermine your cousin's reputation in that moment, to turn people against her to prevent them from being revealed. \n\nAll of that is to say that there is a plausible, if not probable, alternative explanation for the events you witnessed. One that is directly opposed to the one the adults around you would have worked hard to ensure you accepted. And you are especially vulnerable to that kind of manipulation because of your neurotype. We tend not to lie, so we rarely expect others to. But there were strong motivators for them to lie and it's likely you don't have the full truth here. \n\nYour cousin may want to tell you the real truth. She may want to tell you she didn't lie about the abuse and she's sorry she put you in that position. She may want to apologise for lying about the abuse if that's what happened, but I'm very doubtful that's the moment she lied. Regardless, you have an opportunity to get the answer from her about what really happened and you'll never be able to get that chance back once she dies. \n\nI highly recommend you go. There's valuable information waiting for you either way. You won't get this chance again and nobody else will ever be able to tell you the real truth of what caused her behaviour. \n\nAnd finally, if you decide you don't want to go you don't have to. Dying people and those around them behave as if their needs are the most important thing but you still have every right to have your boundaries. So you're NTA for not going, though definitely keep your opinions about her to yourself cause other people feel very strongly that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead and it will unnecessarily harm your relationships to be openly honest here.

My extended family vacillates between behaving as if nothing was ever said and making up obnoxious lies about me as a form of character assassination, even after 10 years of no/limited contact.  Sometimes, the cost of telling/trying to be understood outweighs the benefit.  Consider that your cousin may have said it was just \u201ca joke,\u201d because she was testing the waters of seeing whether telling the truth would be believed and clearly it didn\u2019t go well.  Why would she push it further, when she was invalidated nearly immediately after confiding in you?  If your cousin knows you have Asperger\u2019s, could she have recanted her initial disclosure of abuse  as a joke to keep you from shouldering the emotional/mental burden, perhaps as a kindness to you, after witnessing the severity of your response?\n\nWhether you don\u2019t wish to see her, don\u2019t believe there will be a benefit to seeing her or believe that the cons of going will outweigh the pros, you can choose what\u2019s best for you in whether or not to go.  However, for your own peace of mind, consider not just your current emotions, but whether or not you may have regrets 20, 50, or 70 years from now.  Three years can seem a long time for a 22-year-old\u2014much shorter, the longer you live.  Consider setting realistic/minimal expectations, if you do go.  Consider whether you would want to give her forgiveness, should she request it, or if you\u2019d be content with the conversation not resulting in an apology.  Try to reflect on why what she said continues to hurt you, and what might help you to contend with the hurt in a manner that\u2019s healthiest for you.  Cancel out the noise of the family\u2019s demands/guilting and your aunt\u2019s chatter and just focus on evaluating the situation between you and your cousin.\n\nYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t forgive someone because they\u2019re dying.  And, you don\u2019t owe someone your forgiveness.  I didn\u2019t go to my grandmother\u2019s funeral, nor did I speak to her before she died, and I don\u2019t regret it, knowing the person she was after a lifetime of selfishness/remorselessness.  However, allowing someone a small comfort before they die may surprisingly ease your heart or offer some resolution/finality/memory that you may wish to mentally/emotionally call upon at a later date.  And, sometimes, the act of going and being in that environment with the person dying can alter your perspective\u2014if nothing else, to give you greater understanding.  While my grandfather enabled my grandmother in many ways\u2014and her supporters\u2014I flew to care for him before he passed from his dementia complications, and just like before, I don\u2019t regret it.  His dementia had in many ways returned him to a childlike state, and with it, some of his kinder self of which I had good memories\u2014there was nothing to be gained from trying to get an apology from someone who couldn\u2019t remember his actions.  As it goes, \u201cif it were deserved, it wouldn\u2019t be mercy.\u201d\n\nIn any event, NAH.  We each grieve relationships in our own way.  Anger is a valid part of grief.

Now, she is dying and not only will that person not see or speak to her, they wished her dead faster.  \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can know besides her and her grandmother what the truth is.

My whole world was upended and at the time all I understood was that my friends and family were going to be hours away. I was 11.\n\nMom enrolled me in a summer camp in our new state and though I tried to make new friends, I wasn\u2019t ready. So I turned to the counselors for attention and spun a story about being beaten with a whip and no one believing me. I eventually told the truth after they called my Mom to advise her that they were mandatory reporters. I was kicked out of camp.\n\nDid this mean I hadn\u2019t been horribly scarred by what Uncle did? Quite the opposite.

Welcome to AITA I guess, where if the genders were reversed or Op fence sat enough before presenting his hot take they would\u2019ve been perfectly fine.  I\u2019ve literally seen this sub being okay with not visiting a dying NC family member before, today it\u2019s a heinous crime.  So mercurial.", ">who knew it was bullshit\n\nHow would they know?", "You\u2019re so immature it\u2019s disgusting. Every time someone hurts your feelings you think they deserve a miserable death? I don\u2019t care what she said to you or about your grandmother. \n\nYTA, not because you won\u2019t visit her, but because you want her to die a miserable death", "I don't understand how can someone be this hateful to someone who is dying. She did not bully you she did not hurt you directly, sure you were allowed to be upset but its been 3 years. Get over yourself. Cruel piece of work. You're talking about her as if you're happy she is dying now.", "Oh OP you are god awful. The pettiness you\u2019d need to be shitty to a dying woman. \n\nI hope this follows you for the rest of your miserable life\nYTA", "Yikes", "You\u2019re fucking insufferable. Y def TA", "Jesus Christ I really hope you never make a stupid mistake in your life. Are you seriously saying she deserves to die? For making an abuse accusation that (from the sound of it) you all shouted her down on? Holy crap.", "Info: do you mean that in a \"karma\" sense of the word or that she actual did do something that is causing her death such as drugs or alcohol? I'm trying to figure out where you are coming from here", "Your level of hatred and cruelty is completely abnormal. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with you to be filled with such vitriol. Not to mention I have a feeling she was telling the truth and you\u2019re all just such awful people that you bullied her into pretending she was joking. YTA, no doubt.", "Speaking as someone who watched a family member die young, how dare you!  Terminal illness is not something anyone deserves.  It is not some form of karmic justice.  Ever.", "Nah, I hope he does visit. \n\nShe wants him to come see her, so even though he's overwhelmingly TA, I want a dying girl's wishes to be respected wayyyyy more than I want him to feel guilty and regretful for the rest of his life.", "My eldest has Asperger\u2019s and my second son is also on the spectrum, so I do have a lot of empathy when autistic people post and just really don\u2019t get a situation. I\u2019ve seen it first hand; what\u2019s totally obvious to everyone else in the room, my sons are completely oblivious to. \n\nHowever, this guys behaviour is more about who he is as a person than any diagnosable condition he may have. To be honest, as the comments are so provocative, I\u2019m starting to believe this is just a troll. Nice to see their branching out from all the ridiculous cat stories they seem obsessed with at the moment.", "Don\u2019t diagnose people, you\u2019re doing more harm than good.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to have problems with processing emotions and empathy under several disorders. Stick to the sub imho and hopefully you don\u2019t do this again to another being. SMH\n\nI reported it as misinformation fyi, OP doesn\u2019t need this - they\u2019re already struggling in a situation that\u2019s hard enough. They wouldn\u2019t post here if they felt nothing. Anger is a valid emotion in itself and makes people do disturbing vengeful things - no diagnosis needed.", "Your comment sparked a thought in my sleepy brain - I bet a lot of False Memory syndrome is the result of Flying Monkeys interfering and petitioning it to be changed to Flying Monkey Syndrome", "We really don't know either way - depends on the severity of the joke, really. \n\nI feel like OP should go see her to clear this up, but I don't think we can extrapolate that she was for sure being abused just based on a theory.", "All judgments below are taking this suggestion as gospel", "Yes I'm certain, timing didn't line up and the whole thing didn't make sense.", "You don't think accusing someone of sexual or physical abuse of a child is enough to justify hatred? \n\nThat's not just 'crappy' - it can and does ruin lives. The rest of your comment I don't really have a feeling on - but accusations of the most terrible abuse of children, made against family members, if untrue, are absolutely extreme enough to justify hating someone.", "I had this impression as well", "Why didn't the whole thing make sense? The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the way your family responded to potential abuse.", "So you DON'T know you just THINK that.", "How so? Please elaborate.", "How didn\u2019t it make sense? There\u2019s a whole lot of missing context that makes this hard to fully judge, but from what I\u2019ve seen both in the post and from your comments, YTA and it\u2019s not even close.", "that doesn\u2019t justify a hatred that would lead to one saying outright that the only reason they\u2019d visit would be to toss out their medication, and that their impending death was the karmic result of a single bad action.", "I agree - but I disagree with your point of calling accusations of sexual/physical abuse of a minor is just 'crappy'.\n\nIt can and does end lives. People spend decades in prison, have their reputation ruined, kill themselves, get murdered, have their house firebombed and so on.\n\nThat isn't 'crappy'."]}
