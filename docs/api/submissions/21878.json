My brother and his wife lost everything 6 months ago. Their company liquidated. They lost their house 3 months later because neither of them could find employment in their area. One of their vehicles was repossessed, etc etc. They were living in their vehicle for a month with their kids and dog after selling off all their valuables. My husband and I talked and he reluctantly agreed to let me help them out with a place to stay. See, my husband is unemployed due to a back injury 8 months ago and hates company, especially where I'm hardly home because of how much I'm working. I personally think he's fine now but he says he isn't. So they have been here for 2 months. Both of them now work full time and have helped me out significantly with bills (electric, mortgage, food) because I'm struggling myself since my husband isn't working.\n\nWell, 3 weeks ago my husband told me if they didn't get out of his house that he would leave me. He said he's tired of the kids and dogs and lost his cool on their small child (yelled at him). So he said \"me or them\". I personally went out and purchased them a camper to stick on my property but it needed a lot of work done so my brother has been working on it on his time off but they have been staying in a tent on my property in the meantime. Their dog still stayed in my house due to the heat. \n\nBut now my husband says he's \"fucking done\" with the dog and that they need to all leave and again, gave the same \"me or them\" talk. So I told my brother that they needed to leave and offered to help cover a campground cost and told him why. My brother is extremely pissed at me right now because since they've been here, they have spent almost $3k helping me out with bills, just to be \"tossed out like last week's garbage due to a dead beat low life fuck who sits on his ass all day doing nothing while we all bust our asses and pay his way\". They've spent a lot of what money they've gotten and I am grateful and helped where I could. I understand where he's coming from but at the same time, I took a vow here and I'm not willing to lose my husband for my brother and his family, no matter how hard up they are.\n\nETA: as for the back injury, the doctors have straight up said they think my husband is faking the injury and have stopped all pain meds. Sometimes he acts like he's in pain but other times.. when I'm not really focusing on him, it does kind of look like he's fine. I'm not sure if it's just an excuse to not work. He swears it isn't but idk. He doesn't do anything around the house, no. He watches TV all day.", "created_utc": 1689009976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w0ca3/aita_for_not_helping_my_brother_after_i_said_i/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
