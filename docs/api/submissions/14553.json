Start a court case that'll destroy her mental health and might cause her to die? We did not have an affair and did not start dating until she left that house. She is an amazing mother.", "Fight for her kid. There is no way I would ever allow someone to take my kid, not let me see my kid especially when it\u2019s it the custody agreement, and no way in hell I wouldn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with my kid. I\u2019m a mother of 2 and this all sounds ridiculous. \nNo where in there does it say stay with the ex. It also sounds like there are two emotionally immature people on the opposite side of a power hungry family. \nGood for you for canceling a trip so she could be with her kid but I mean the reality is, had she been checking on her kid daily, communicating with the child (you said they\u2019re 12) she would\u2019ve known sooner. I\u2019m sure the kid has a cellphone or some type of device. Just sounds like a lot of questionable parenting otherwise.", "This is pathetic. She'd rather not know when her kid is severely injured than go thru with fighting for her kid. She's a mother. Her kid comes before her \"mental health\".", "Yes, her son has a cellphone but it's not like kids always answer. He goes days at a time to respond sometimes and sometimes he won't stop texting all day. That's how it is. And hey, good for you for being mentally healthy enough to fight something that my wife can't, but that doesn't make her a bad mother. She'd rather stay alive and be healthy so that when her son needs her, like now, she can be there for him instead of a mental wreck who would be a burden on him.", "NTA and what Johann did is WRONG.  One parent is required to notify the other in an emergency. You need to lawyer up and do something about this.  Nosy GM is way out of line.", "You should have told Johann's mother that she has zero moral high ground to stand on considering she raised her son to be a man who knocked up a teenager when he was 36.

Per OP's comments, wife left ex-husband for OP which is why both ex and this mother have an issue with OP. Ex-husband has primary custody and wife is supposed to have every other weekend but hasn't enforced that for almost 2 years. She won't do anything to enforce the custody agreement because that would cause her mental anguish. Sounds like or child was overjoyed to see her because she has made herself basically absent from his life.\n\nOTOH, Ex should have notified wife so ESH.", "She'd probably just quote something from the Bible if I did that.", "Then your wife is also being an asshole. She needs to shiny up her spine and do what's best for her child.", "You guys need to document this and see emphasize to your wife that her not speaking mean that she could be sending her son right into another bad situation. The dad and ex mil seem mean enough to get mad at the kid just for being happy to see his mom.", "Yeah, my comment was from a few hours ago so no word from OP at the time. Thanks", "Agreed. The wife is the AH here.", "No, she is not. It's very easy and toxic to say grow a backbone.", "I literally responded to you right away.", "I think I worded that confusingly. I didn't mean that I had not heard from you. I meant that I did not see all of the comments you posted between now and then providing context", "It would kill her to actually love her son and fight for him? She's a terrible mother in that case.

And you don't leave someone you're married to for someone else with ZERO emotional affairs", "Surprised people want to take the ex's side because Emilia left him for her current partner. I mean the guy is 49. She's 32. The son is 12. She was at most 20 years old when she had a child with a man in his late thirties? Icccck", "Yeah, I know. The problem is, she does not want to subject herself to any of that. Even the idea of going and speaking to our lawyer about this causes her to shut down.", "We started dating after she left him. We married after they got divorced. Johann was not abusive but he was extremely negligent, cold, unattached and did not care for her. It was like she lived with an icicle. We did not have an affair so don't imagine we did.", "I fell in love with her and it took a while until she felt the same way as me. But when she did, we didn't do anything. Only after she left him did we start dating. That's not an affair. And she loves her son more than anything in the world. If she was able to mentally handle the process, we would have fought for proper shared custody.", "No, she is not. She is an amazing mother who is doing what's right for herself by staying healthy and emotionally available. And we did not have an affair.", "Are you guys in the US? If so, Dylan is old enough to choose who he wants to live with full time. Just throwing that out there. Hope he feels better soon!", "I get that she's probably traumatized by the process, but this isn't just about her, it's also about her son. Is she thinking about how he'd feel if he learned she could have fought for more custody but didn't? How Johann might escalate trying to alienate her relationship with her son if she can't get more visitation/custody, or use her fear of takimg him to court to just stop letting her have certain rights, *like twlling her when their kid is in the hospital?!* \n\nThis is going to get worse for her, not better, so I hope you can convince her to bring this to court bc I would hate for her to risk her relationship with her son over it.", "Some people want to see imaginary affairs.", "Yes, the circumstances leading to this situation were entirely innocent.\n\nYou knew damn well you wouldn't be welcome, and you understand perfectly why. YTA, and that will never change.", "Except she doesn't care enough about him to keep fighting or to do anything else that causes her emotional distress. Highly unlikely that she \"would die for him\" if she won't even take the necessary steps to see him.", "We're in Canada and from what I've read, he won't really get a choice until he's 16. I'm confident he'll choose to live with us.", "The way she sees it is that when he's old enough, he'll understand. But for right now, it's better for her to be there alive and healthy when he needs her than be dead because she did something she knew she wouldn't be able to handle even if it was for him.", "First. What's better? That she dies because she chose to go to court and her son no longer has a mother? Or that he has one who is alive, healthy and there for him?\n\nAs for your comment suggesting I had an affair. I was not living in their basement by the time she left him. I had not even seen her for a few months by then. She didn't even contact me until about two months after she left him. We got together after that, her divorce process started and after she got divorced, we got married. Or do you want me to give you a detailed essay of everything that happened?", "You realize the emotional distress I'm talking about isn't that she gets a mild headache or feels sad, right? It's far more severe that. I don't want her to start popping pills to be able to cope.", "An amazing mother will do anything, and I mean ANYTHING for their child. You said in other comments that she only has visitation every other weekend and even that doesn\u2019t happen. So this \u201camazing mom\u201d doesn\u2019t put any effort into seeing her kid. What would kill me is NOT seeing my children-fighting for them would be the reason I wanted to live.", "Well first, you had been dodgy about a few questions around how your relationship started, so yeah, I asked for details like many others did. I was wrong and I\u2019ll own that. I appreciate you answering that. \n\nHowever, for the most part, it would seem that your wife is not in fact there for her son. She refuses to try to go to court. It would seem she\u2019s not stood up for herself and her son when it comes to her ex dodging her visitation weekends. If she would do anything for her son, then she would stand up to ex for not allowing her her legally granted visitation, or go to court and tell the judge that he isn\u2019t allowing him to see her during her legal visitation time. She. Isn\u2019t. Doing. That. I don\u2019t know if their relationship was abusive, and if it was I very personally understand the trauma around fighting your abusive ex, but someone who would do anything for their kid would actually, well, do it. You keep saying she \u201cwould die\u201d- if you\u2019re concerned that she would unalive herself, then she needs to be in serious therapy if it comes to the point where you legitimately think she would unalive herself before fighting for custody. \n\nFor what\u2019s it\u2019s worth, I do not think you\u2019re the asshole for taking her to the hospital, and ex should have told her IMMEDIATELY. It is extremely shitty for them to act like his mother who he is allowed to see had no right to be there.", "Oh that is ridiculous. Secure your own mask first."]}
