We did not have an affair so don't imagine we did.", "I fell in love with her and it took a while until she felt the same way as me. But when she did, we didn't do anything. Only after she left him did we start dating. That's not an affair. And she loves her son more than anything in the world. If she was able to mentally handle the process, we would have fought for proper shared custody.", "No, she is not. She is an amazing mother who is doing what's right for herself by staying healthy and emotionally available. And we did not have an affair.", "Are you guys in the US? If so, Dylan is old enough to choose who he wants to live with full time. Just throwing that out there. Hope he feels better soon!", "I get that she's probably traumatized by the process, but this isn't just about her, it's also about her son. Is she thinking about how he'd feel if he learned she could have fought for more custody but didn't? How Johann might escalate trying to alienate her relationship with her son if she can't get more visitation/custody, or use her fear of takimg him to court to just stop letting her have certain rights, *like twlling her when their kid is in the hospital?!* \n\nThis is going to get worse for her, not better, so I hope you can convince her to bring this to court bc I would hate for her to risk her relationship with her son over it.", "Some people want to see imaginary affairs.", "Yes, the circumstances leading to this situation were entirely innocent.\n\nYou knew damn well you wouldn't be welcome, and you understand perfectly why.

Highly unlikely that she \"would die for him\" if she won't even take the necessary steps to see him.", "We're in Canada and from what I've read, he won't really get a choice until he's 16. I'm confident he'll choose to live with us.", "The way she sees it is that when he's old enough, he'll understand. But for right now, it's better for her to be there alive and healthy when he needs her than be dead because she did something she knew she wouldn't be able to handle even if it was for him.", "First. What's better? That she dies because she chose to go to court and her son no longer has a mother? Or that he has one who is alive, healthy and there for him?\n\nAs for your comment suggesting I had an affair. I was not living in their basement by the time she left him. I had not even seen her for a few months by then. She didn't even contact me until about two months after she left him. We got together after that, her divorce process started and after she got divorced, we got married. Or do you want me to give you a detailed essay of everything that happened?", "You realize the emotional distress I'm talking about isn't that she gets a mild headache or feels sad, right? It's far more severe that. I don't want her to start popping pills to be able to cope.", "An amazing mother will do anything, and I mean ANYTHING for their child. You said in other comments that she only has visitation every other weekend and even that doesn\u2019t happen. So this \u201camazing mom\u201d doesn\u2019t put any effort into seeing her kid. What would kill me is NOT seeing my children-fighting for them would be the reason I wanted to live.", "Well first, you had been dodgy about a few questions around how your relationship started, so yeah, I asked for details like many others did. I was wrong and I\u2019ll own that. I appreciate you answering that. \n\nHowever, for the most part, it would seem that your wife is not in fact there for her son. She refuses to try to go to court. It would seem she\u2019s not stood up for herself and her son when it comes to her ex dodging her visitation weekends. If she would do anything for her son, then she would stand up to ex for not allowing her her legally granted visitation, or go to court and tell the judge that he isn\u2019t allowing him to see her during her legal visitation time. She. Isn\u2019t. Doing. That. I don\u2019t know if their relationship was abusive, and if it was I very personally understand the trauma around fighting your abusive ex, but someone who would do anything for their kid would actually, well, do it. You keep saying she \u201cwould die\u201d- if you\u2019re concerned that she would unalive herself, then she needs to be in serious therapy if it comes to the point where you legitimately think she would unalive herself before fighting for custody. \n\nFor what\u2019s it\u2019s worth, I do not think you\u2019re the asshole for taking her to the hospital, and ex should have told her IMMEDIATELY. It is extremely shitty for them to act like his mother who he is allowed to see had no right to be there.", "Oh that is ridiculous. Secure your own mask first.", "ESH except Dylan. Ex and his mom for not letting you guys know he had been injured and was in the hospital; you and your wife for having an emotional affair that precipitated the divorce.", "NTA. Your wife's ex inlaws are out of order here. Not a big surprise that the creep that knocked up a teenage in his late 30s remains an AH. His mom being an even bigger AH is a surprise.", "NTA. She is well within her rights to see her son when there\u2019s a medical emergency and he\u2019s been hurt (that was actually in the court ordered custody order my ex and I had).

And maybe if you\u2019re there for her now, it will be easier for her.  She has visitation, so I don\u2019t understand how it has become difficult when the two of you very much want to see her son. Can you explain more?", "What\u2019s easy and toxic is to throw up your hands and say \u201coh it\u2019s too hard\u201d and start a replacement family while your ex takes off with your kid.", "Who is taking the exs side? And by that definition of ick\u2026 she\u2019s 32 and her current husband is 25. Ickkkk. Bc it\u2019s still an age gap. The point made was, as a mother, how did she not know her child was injured for days. If you are a \u201cgreat\u201d mother actively involved in your child\u2019s life, it wouldn\u2019t have been days to find out the child was injured. That was the point. The point was, why would the bio dad/ex husband be so vindictive as to not reach out. Some people will reach where there\u2019s nothing to reach for. So keep reaching. Evidence is evidence. You\u2019ve giving enough context clues to show I\u2019m not wrong, you just want to look right. And OP you can spin it how you see fit but you and the person and HER HUSBAND you rented from during COLLEGE end ups in a relationship and you said she left him to be with you. That means, she was emotionally cheating prior to leaving her husband for you. So spin it how ya want but infidelity is still infidelity. There is more than one way to cheat.

If her mental health is so fragile that a court battle could destroy her, but she also cares about seeing her son, she needs to get better. If she is not doing that, then she and she alone is the reason she is not fighting to see her son (and I don\u2019t even mean going back to court, since she already has visitation).  If she is not even trying to get better, then that\u2019s her issue but it also means that she\u2019s not taking steps towards even trying to see her son.", "NTA her son was injured and in the hospital and she wasn't informed immediately. She had to be informed days later and by another family member. That is not okay at all. \n\nI don't know what your guys issue is with considering trying to alter the current custody arrangement but I really think yous should sit down and seriously discuss it. No parent has the right to keep the information that their child is injured from the other. It is wrong. Even more so since her son clearly wanted her there for support", "NTA I will pray for you all, especially this child. May the hand of the lord be placed upon this child from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. He will be healed soon, and may he have the fortitude to seek mom always and at age 16 go live with you all.  Amen!", "In what world could you possibly be in the wrong? This was a medical emergency involving your wife\u2019s CHILD. She needed to be there. \nSorry that the situation is so difficult. That father does sound spiteful and his family clearly aren\u2019t much better. But if it helps, children know the truth, even if they can\u2019t articulate it.\nNTA.", "nta-if you as a stap parent should stay inside, why was she inside telling you this?", "Some MILs have a hard time separating themselves from their sons so anyone who goes against her son is automatically the devil.", "No, what\u2019s toxic is making assumptions about other peoples lives outside of what has been provided. You seem to have some idea of what happened during OP\u2019s wife\u2019s divorce(based on what I do not know), but from what OP has told us, her well-to-do ex did his best during the divorce to successfully traumatize his ex. Also, OP\u2019s wife is 32 and \"Johann\" is 49 - in every other comparable situation redditors would be falling over themselves accusing \"Johann\" of grooming his partner and OP\u2019s wife his victim, yet here she\u2019s called an asshole. NTA but the Professor over here sure as shit is.", "Replacement family? We are not a replacement family. We do not have children and nor will we ever. My wife has told me the only case in which she would ever have another child is if her son dies and if that's the cost? It's way too fucking much. I know she just threw an extreme case out there to get me to shut up about kids but I get it. He is my wife's family and I hope that he will see me as family too.", "This is terrible.  The kid's father is an AH, but she refuses to fight?  I and so many others having dealt with abusers didn't just up and leave our kids.  ESH but the kid.  Poor little dude.", ">No, what\u2019s toxic is making assumptions about other peoples lives outside of what has been provided.\n\nThank you. People get a few glimpses and think they know shit.", "How do we know she left Johann for OP? I didn\u2019t see that anywhere.", "I am in canada.  I got a say at 13.  However both my parents were considered competent.", "In Canada, you need to be 12.  Personal experience.", "I am very much hoping she'll be willing to fight for it. The way she's cared for her son since we brought him to our home is like a fire got lit under her.", "I'm in ontario we have local co-ops.\n\nAsk him if he has bagged milk that'll narrow it down.  Lol", "NTA. How old was your wife when she got started dating Johann? She had her son when she was 20, and Johann was 37. That is quite an age gap.", "ESH, so your wife is an absentee mother and you are defending her refusal to even utilize the visitation she has? Yeah it's no wonder her in laws weren't overjoyed that she showed up out of the blue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she's such a good mom and loves her kid she needs to show up for him REGULARLY!!", "NTA but I'd make a record of this because it seems like he's trying to alienate her from her son. That's huge that the child was seriously injured and in the hospital and they never even attempted to contact her to let her know.", "Your wife was 20 when she had him, the father was 37....\n\nThere is nothing about that relationship that would have been healthy, fair, balanced or equal.\n\nHis mother being nasty is also not surprising. Glad your wife got out of that relationship. Do they have a custody arrangement for the kid? Imagine being hurt and no-one calls you mom!!\n\nNTA", "It sounds like it's not a violation at all, or op would have said so. And also the fact that it's remarkable the kid called his mom, mom. That shouldn't be remarkable. It sounds like Dad has sole custody and OP is leaving out all the relevant info on why the mom shouldn't have been at the hospital.", "She didn\u2019t even see him for Christmas? And he\u2019s 12? Jfc dude. Stop calling her an amazing mother. You\u2019re enabling her bullshit. YTA", "Dude, you must be dreaming if you think that Dylan is going to choose you guys at 16. Her ex is successfully alienating him from her and her being an ostrich is not helping. In a way, it is fortunate that you found out about his injury when you did, because at least he got to see his mommy and know she didn't abandon him.", "I think she was groomed. I also think she left her child with a predator and walked away. They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive", "To get you to shut up about kids? Why are you with this AH? You've not said one thing in this entire post that's redeeming to her! \n\nYTA for staying with somebody that finds it easy to walk away from their only child and refuses to let their husband have a child that he clearly wants!", "Info: dead? As in un living herself? There are so many missing reasons. Family court is not keen to grant full physical custody to one parent without a reason, even taking income disparities into account. \n\nWhat\u2019s the real reason she doesn\u2019t have custody and refuses to persue it? Does she have a restraining order against her? Why is the child acknowledging his mom so significant? When was the last time they saw each other? Under what circumstances?\n\nThis is written to make dad sound like a controlling jerk and grandma needs to back off, but something is fishy about this whole dynamic", "So you're saying they'll kill her if she goes for custody?", "What he'll understand is that she didn't even try.", "In Canada he\u2019s well past the age the courts will consider his feelings/desires.", "That gives dad 4 more years to fill his mind with whatever stories dad wants to tell about her. He is missing his mom in his developmental years. That will not be easy for him to overcome.\nNTA for taking her to the hospital.", "The amount of excuses you make for your wife is ridiculous. NTA for going to the hospital with her, but if all the other things are true, seems like everyone sucks but the kid.", "Get therapy and medical treatment for her mental health to start. \n\nThis whole \u201cshe would die for him\u201d and \u201cmight die\u201d if she goes back to court is such bullshit. Do you have any medical evidence this would be the outcome? Did her mental health affect her visitation?\n\nAnd if she left him for you, the relationship wasn\u2019t above board. She was investing herself into you and you agreed. I\u2019m honestly wondering why. Genuinely curious"]}
