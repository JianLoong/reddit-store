Her and I used to be close and butted heads some but that wasn\u2019t anything new for her as she butted heads with most people she interacted with. We had a fallen out a few years ago and haven\u2019t spoken since (I disagreed with her and that was unacceptable) My husband lost both of his parents a few years apart before we met and now it\u2019s just him and one surviving sister. The surviving sister and I used to be close also but because the other sister was angry with me, she is angry with me also, I guess some sort of sister code, I don\u2019t know, I have 4 brothers and we each think for ourselves and don\u2019t involve ourselves in each others business. \n\nSo the surviving sister and I haven\u2019t spoken in 2 years and my husband is on the phone with her discussing our trip to their home state to make arrangements and she lashes out about how \u201cYour wife better not be after (deceased sister\u2019s) money and she is not allowed to give her opinion on anything while she is here!\u201d. My husband explained to her that I am his wife and I am part of the family and I am going to be there for emotional support for him and I have no interest in her money or trying to take over planning as I am not that kind of person. \n\nSo that makes two significant times,not to mention all of the hundreds of times there have been petty comments made about me the past two years, where I have been disrespected and treated like crap when I did nothing to deserve it in the first place. After my husband defended me, she treated him like crap the remainder of the day, even ending a conversation with \u201cI don\u2019t have the time or energy to deal with this with you\u201d. \n\nI am struggling with there not being reconciliation before her death and I have to live with that the rest of my life and of course I would never want the same thing to happen with the other sister but I also refuse to be treated poorly. \n\nI know the right thing to do is to be there for my husband no matter the circumstances but I feel uneasy about this and I told my husband I do not want to attend. Not to mention,financially, we really can\u2019t afford to take a trip there, so WIBTA for not attending her memorial service for fear of it causing drama? I know it\u2019s completely my husband \u2018s decision on whether he attends but even more so, AITA for telling him that I do not understand why he would want to pay his respects to someone who didn\u2019t respect either one of us when she was alive? Someone who would go years without speaking to him and eventually do the same to me?

Your job in this situation is to be there for your husband. If he wants you to attend the memorial service, go with him - you're doing this for him, not for either of his sisters. As for 'not understanding' why he'd want to go, shut down that line of thinking right away. It's not your place to tell him how or how not to grieve his dead sister, or to invalidate his sense of loss by complaining about her. *His* feelings come first right now; you're allowed to dislike his sisters, but if there was ever a time to keep your negativity to yourself and be 100% supportive, it's now.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister-in-law making those comments sucks, but she just lost her sister.\n\nYour husband is going through his own wave of emotions, grieving missed opportunities for reconciliation, losing one of only two remaining family members, etc.\n\nAs his wife, your job is to stand there, hold his hand during the funeral, and let him do his thing. After that you're back at home and you can move on with your life.\n\nIt sounds like you'll only have to do this one other time (with his other sister, if you outlive her). Just be there for your husband as I'm sure he would do the same for you. Dragging up hurts from the past helps nobody.", "YTA. You told your husband you don\u2019t think he should go to his dead sisters memorial. No wonder the sisters don\u2019t like you.", "YTA for not going to support your husband at a difficult funeral when he needs you there.  Swallow your pride and grow up.  If you were better than her, you would give some grace to a grieving woman.\n\n>AITA for telling him that I do not understand why he would want to pay his respects to someone who didn\u2019t respect either one of us when she was alive\n\nSuper asshole for this.  How dare he go the funeral of a loved one when I am super spiteful!  It doesn't sound like the sister is the one who butts heads here.", "YTA. You're there to support your husband. No one else. The others are irrelevant. Don't acknowledge their existence but you have to be there for your husband. You're his wife, supposed to be there for him through better or worse. This is part of the \"worse\" whether you like it or not. Either be a real one or show him you ain't shit.", "IDK if both sister's didn't get along with you, I suspect this may not be a reliable narrative.", "YTA for telling your husband \u201cI do not understand \u201cwhy [your husband] would want to pay respects\u201d to the sister he was estranged from and be around the sister who dislikes you. I suggest you stay home and your husband attend the funeral without you.", "Light YTA. Family drama is always the worst, but what makes you TA is your comment about how you don't understand why your husband would want to go. Drama or not, his sister was his family, someone he grew up alongside, and people will absolutely grieve the loss of someone even if the relationship was complicated. You going to the service would be to support your spouse, someone you pledged to love through thick and thin. It's times like this where you need to be there for your loved ones the most. During times of grief and death, things like \"petty comments\" really don't matter. And while I'm sorry that you have issues that were left unresolved with your SIL before her passing, it doesn't really excuse turning your back on your husband.", "Nta", "YTA none of this is about you. None. Making it about you will confirm to his sister that she and their late sister were right all along. You need to support your husband, tell him your opinions in private while staying silent during sibling discussions, and be the bigger person. They're grieving, part of that is anger and sometimes it's misplaced. However, I also get the feeling there was a little more than just a disagreement between you and the late sister, so I would love more details there.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"AITA for telling him that I do not understand why he would want to pay his respects to someone who didn\u2019t respect either one of us when she was alive?\" ..

You go, support your husband, and bite your tongue around his relatives.", "I'd say NTA for not attending the service, but\n\n>AITA for telling him that I do not understand why he would want to pay his respects to someone who didn\u2019t respect either one of us when she was alive\n\nThat's kind of asshole-ish to say about his sister.

If your husband feels like he can go to the funeral alone without your being there for emotional support, then he should attend, but don't discourage him from attending if that's what he wants to do. If nothing else, it might serve as closure for him.", "Three major incidents took place. The first being the day we got married. We got married during pandemic because we had chosen a specific date prior to pandemic and were dead set on that date. We never wanted anything big, I\u2019ve been married before and he hasn\u2019t prior to me so we wanted it to just us, my daughter from my previous marriage and my best friend who performed the ceremony. We did this with the plan of having a casual celebration at a later date where all friends and family could come. Everyone knew our plans and things were moving forward until his sister (deceased one) decided to drive 9 hours with her boyfriend and invite herself to the ceremony. We were kind of ok with it but still annoyed. She got to her hotel around 1 am and demanded we drive the 15 min to come see her the night before we are to be married. I didn\u2019t understand why if she wanted to see us that bad, she didn\u2019t continue driving the extra 15 min and come to us and I also wasn\u2019t going to get dressed and leave my house to stay out all night before we get married. I also don\u2019t listen to demands. There was a disagreement, she threatened to drive back home and it ended with her attending the ceremony the next day and inviting her and the boyfriend over to our place after the ceremony and staying until 4 am which totally ruined our wedding night plans. The second incident was husband and I had an argument and he called living sister to vent and instead of listening and offering unbiased opinions and advice, she manipulated the situation, lied about me (which I had proof she was lying) and had him almost convinced to leave me. Third incident, during a time when we were financially struggling we borrowed $25 from his sister (deceased) and after she sent me the money she texted him some snide comment about us having to borrow it and I called her and said very politely \u201cThank you for the money. We really appreciate it. We feel down and out enough about about the situation we are in and the snide comments are unnecessary as it makes us feel worse.\u201d Her response is \u201cF\u2014\u2014- You B\u2014\u2014-! You can\u2019t tell me what I can or can\u2019t say.\u201d She hung up on me and those are the last words she ever spoke to me.", "I guess I should have mentioned that he has gone back and forth on whether he is attending because of her behavior. But let me be clear, I never once mentioned that I dislike his sisters. I love and care about them both but that is my nature, when I care for someone it\u2019s genuine and unconditional or fake. I don\u2019t stop caring for someone just because of a tiny disagreement.", "Did you read how the other sister started berating her as soon as the husband was talking about her being there I wouldn't go either I wanna be there for my wife at all times but if I was getting put down by family members of my partner like that I wouldn't go either no one deserves to be treated like shit a death in the family or not", "Three major incidents took place.

But again, your relationship with them is beside the point here. Let your husband make up his own mind about attending, do *not* pressure him against it in *any* way, and attend with him if he decides to go.", "It seems to me that the sister was stating specific concerns, likely based off of OP\u2019s past actions which are conveniently left out of the post. But since there\u2019s clearly a lot missing there, we can\u2019t really say much about those comments or OP not going. \n\nBut, telling someone that **they** shouldn\u2019t go to their dead sister\u2019s memorial is a 100% AH move. And that speaks to the likelihood that OP is doing other assholery. Which leads me to believe the sisters don\u2019t like OP because OP does Asshole nonsense.", "I\u2019m not sure what past actions she is basing her comments on considering we haven\u2019t spoken in 2 years and she was only mad at me because her sister was. I left nothing out and in fact posted the three incidents that were the only times there were ever disagreements between us in a comment."]}
