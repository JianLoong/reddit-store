Your children do not need to be around someone on meth. Period. That drug dramatically changes a persons behavior and can make someone way more agitated and aggressive.

Respectfully, one suggestion: find an Al-Anon or Narc-Anon meeting and make time to go every week or so. You deserve support and accolades for establishing healthy boundaries.

The fact that she got clean and was able to see how he wasn\u2019t able to enjoy being around his kids and grandkids , that alone should\u2019ve opened her eyes like that could\u2019ve been me .. not having a relationship with my daughter or grand babies but that still wasn\u2019t enough to keep her off the drugs and that\u2019s horrible! And I don\u2019t blame u ! The favoritism has it always been that way? Or only when she\u2019s on drugs? I mean it\u2019s wrong regardless but it does happen alot even with parents and aunts and uncles and cousins etc .. coming from a huge family I\u2019ve definitely seen it and lived it .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to protect your kids and keep your healthy boundaries strong. It sounds like your mom may need some grief counseling as it seems she may be having trouble handling your dad's death and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms drove her back to bad habits.", "NTA. This is her addiction talking.", "NTA at all, and I actually was in a situation sorta like this, so I know how guilty one can make you feel for cutting contact. (long anecdotal comment, you can ignore if you don\u2019t care)\n\nBoth of my parents used meth/heroin during my childhood, but got clean independently when I was in my early teens. My dad has remained clean to this day, and while I\u2019d like to think my mom did too- I heavily suspected her of using meth again when I was around 15- although I cannot confirm 100%. Since I wasn\u2019t living with her, I went low contact to protect myself from anymore trauma, because her behavior change was visible. My mom passed two years ago, and I still do not regret going low contact- even if I\u2019m not sure if she really relapsed. I did what was best for my well being, and trusting my gut probably saved me from more anguish. I mention this mostly because when I did go low contact, I worried that I was being horrible, and I wondered if I\u2019d regret it after she passed away. But frankly, keeping someone in your life for that reason alone is just not worth it.\n\nGood luck, and I hope your mother makes a full recovery \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA!

Do not let a drug addict be around your children, not matter who.\n2. If your mom calls you \"disrespectful\", tell her you will respect her again when she's clean.
