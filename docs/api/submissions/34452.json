I never knew my parents together. From what I was made aware of they had a very brief relationship and I was the result. I have a sister from my dad who is 3 years older than me. No siblings on mom's side. My parents shared custody of me during my childhood but I always preferred dad's house. I was always closer to dad than to mom, and I always loved being around my sister.\n\nMy stepsister used to adore me and think we were sister's and BFFs forever. She had no siblings so to her I was that sibling. We were about 14 and 15 when she found out I didn't feel the same way about her. She read my homework one night and I had to write a personal piece from a topic of choices (the choices were basically different family members/relationship types and I went with siblings). She was really upset after learning I didn't consider her one of my siblings and never did. She stopped being so into me after that which wasn't a big deal to me. She grew more resentful of me when we were in our very early 20s because I moved into an apartment with my sister which she learned about from my mom. The few times I saw her after that she was always very snarky when asking if I liked having a sister that much and how nice it must be to be loved back.\n\nMy stepsister is now getting married and she didn't send me an invite. It upset my mom and her husband a lot and they asked why and she told them I'm not her sister, I don't give a crap about her and she doesn't want me there. My mom told me I should ask her to invite me and beg if I have to. She told me otherwise it will look so awful and like we're not a family.\n\nI refused. Mom said I should be upset to miss out on her big day and I clearly told her I did not care. Mom said I should and I should be willing to do this for her if nothing else.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: The homework I wrote was not about my stepsister. It was about my sister. But I said I had one sibling, my sister, which is how my stepsister realized how I felt or how I didn't see her. And my stepsister took it out of my backpack. It was not left lying around where she could find it easily.

You have a real (half) sibling. SO you don't view a step sister as a real sibling. Said sister has NO other sisters so she went full into treating you like a real sister.\n\nWhen she found out that feeling wasn't reciprocated she began to resent you and has never stopped.\n\nI think she probably wants you to ask to be included as it would be satisfying and vindicating for her.\n\nI can also understand why you'd never swallow your pride and do that.\n\nI think NAH here, actually. You made it clear shes not important to you, so she didn't invite you to her wedding. You're not going to beg to go. It's all fairly reasonable, if petty.\n\n**EDIT: My judgement was NAH because my consideration and judgement is extending the OP and the Step Sister ONLY.**   \nI agree, if we add the parents into consideration, the MOTHER is the asshole, because of her desire to have OP at the wedding, and not just ASKING the step sister herself. Mom needs to butt out and mind her own business rather than try to coerce OP into begging.", "This is no longer about you and your step sister. It is about your mother and her ego. Your mother doesn't want everyone to know that you are not one big happy family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If your mum wants you there so badly, let \\*her\\* beg.

She's entitled to HER feelings. That's where it ends. \n\nAs far as how it looks, who cares? You don't exist as a prop for their picture perfect family. This isn't a Hallmark Special. It's real life.", "NTA.Do not beg so that your mom has a fake \u201c ideal\u201d family .Yes-you do some  things to make a good parent happy .But lying or being fake is not something you should have to do.", "Your mom literally told you it was all about keeping up appearances. Keeping up appearances means more to your mom than actually understanding why stepsister doesn't want to invite you and why you have no desire to go. \n\nNTA. Set a boundary along the lines of \"if you bring this up again, I'm hanging up/walking away\" then do it.", "NTA anyone who says otherwise need to get their heads out their ass, you WERE A CHILD and you didn\u2019t feel the same for her. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t hate her or bully her and not being close to your step sibling is fine and normal. IF ANYTHING she, the step sister is the AH for holding on to a petty grudge for so long", "NTA.  She's right.  You're not her sister.  You don't give a crap about her.  And she doesn't want you there.  Nothing to argue about there.  All your mom cares about are optics.", "NTA. If it matters so much to your mom, SHE can beg her stepdaughter for your invite.", " NTA.

If your mom wants you there she can beg for that invite. You have no reason to lower yourself to that level.", "NTA. I think your parents might be a lil' bit though, because they seem to care more about how it will *look* than about your and your stepsister's feelings. You were under no obligation to love your stepsis and we don't even know if your mom and stepdad took the necessary precautions when forming a blended family - lots of people just shove the kids together and hope they get along. It sucks that your stepsister found out the hard way and it sucks that she's been resentful of you ever since, but I don't think you're an AH for that. And neither is she, because it's her wedding and she has the right to invite (or not invite) anyone she wants to. If I were you, given that you're now grown up, I wouldn't beg to be invited to the wedding, but I would reach out to your stepsister and try to talk things out with her, as that could make you both much happier in the future.", "NTA although I feel bad for your step sister, you're not actually related and you don't have to like her if you don't want to.\n\nYour step sister realised she was wasting her time trying to build a relationship with you and cut you out of her life, which sounds like it's what you wanted anyway so there should be no issue here. Mom needs to butt out of this. It's nothing to do with her. You and your step-sister aren't family in any way that matters.

If I was in her position I wouldn\u2019t want you there either, this is a big day to be shared with people who care about her.

I have a step-sister and we do not get on. She never invited me to our wedding and it was no big deal to anyone. Likewise my brother didn\u2019t invite her or our step-brother to either of his weddings. Nobody batted an eyelid.\n\nIf you managed to get an invite you\u2019d know the bride doesn\u2019t really want you there, and you don\u2019t really want to be there. So you are doing the right thing by not making it a thing.", "NTA.  Never beg to be somewhere you're not wanted.  Very interesting that your mother is only concerned about appearances.", "Why is it on you to not make the family look awful? Does your mom not understand how invitations work?

Your mother should have been made aware of this when you were teenagers, she had years to tackle these feelings. \n\nIt sucks for her but hopefully she finds people who love her for her.", "NTA - your mom is saddling you with all these \"shoulds\" like you're some kind of beast of burden. Not all step relations feel like family. I'm remarried and our boys have known each other since they were 7, 7 & 4. We married when they were teens and they all have said they don't feel like brothers, just friends. They are now 22, 22 & 19. We fully respect that and would never force them to participate in each other's lives. They are just buds.", "NAH. She isn\u2019t your sister, you made that clear and she responded accordingly. Might have been nice if you had made an effort to be a family, but at this point that ship,has sailed.", "I realize blended families are complicated and that you were a kid and teenager for a lot of the backstory, but it doesn't sound like you've been very nice to your stepsister. You talk about her being resentful, but what's your deal? Why didn't you make more room for her in your life/heart?", "NTA for any of it !! \n\nYour mum shouldn\u2019t be asking you to beg for anything especially for a wedding when you not receiving a invite clearly shows they don\u2019t want you to attend \n\nYour step sister is wrong for invading your space and going through your personal belongings it\u2019s her fault for how she feels since she was  snooping. You don\u2019t have to class her as a sibling", "NTA", "NTA and Mom needs to stay the heck out of it. Love the mom guilt tactics\u2026 it didn\u2019t work trying to force the stepdaughter to give the invite, so now she\u2019s switched to trying to guilt you into begging for one lol", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because even if you did write to her and ask, it would be a pity invite. She doesn\u2019t want you there and you don\u2019t want to be there. You wouldn\u2019t have fun anyway. \n\nYour mom needs to get over that you two aren\u2019t close. I guarantee she\u2019s probably just trying to save face with the rest of the family\u2014trying to avoid the inevitable questions from people wondering why you aren\u2019t there.", "was there ever actually a reason why you had an issue with her? either way, NTA. you two don't have a close relationship and she isn't required to invite you, and certainly shouldn't be begging anyone to let you come to something you aren't wanted at. that's just ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nHate to say it, but the truth is going to have to out now.  Sometimes you can't control other people, and subsequently public impressions.\n\nI'm assuming this wasn't a failure on their part and just the way it was.  You can't fake feelings, and no one is at fault that you just didn't feel close to her.  Anyone who genuinely loves them should understand that.  If anyone doesn't, maybe it should be rethought whether or not you want to be close enough to them for a wedding invite.", "I think you picked your subject matter based on your dislike for your step. And not sure but your sister by your dad only would she be a half-sister? Nothing wrong with that. But I have been trying to sort who is who. No idea why you don\u2019t care for your step that much considering she use to adore you. Not bullying you, accepting you. You could have written about your dad with a positive approach but went after your step with a negative approach. And no idea if you left your homework out hoping she reads it. I think your step is justified in feeling how she feels. But would be nice if she could extend the invite and just hope you both stay out of each other\u2019s way and you don\u2019t try to act hostile. If you can\u2019t behave properly best you aren\u2019t there. As to your begging, nobody should beg for any invitation. So based on just that fact alone, NTA.  But have to wonder if you are one and have been one with your step.", "NAH. The mom doesnt need to force anything", "I'm going to go with NAH. I don't think the mother is in the right, but I can understand why it would upset her that OP is not invited if she considers them all to be family. Weird to ask OP to beg though but I get the fact she brought it up. The step sister is not an AH because she shouldn't be obligated to invite anyone to a wedding she doesn't want there, and OP is not an AH for refusing to beg because she doesn't want to go and that's generally a bad plan. Without knowing any more context about the family in general and if anyone has actively been an AH to anyone else at any point (I can totally see why it sucked for the stepsister to find out she wasn't considered a sister but equally she snooped), then it just seems like a fairly unfortunate situation.", "NAH - except maybe mom. Sounds like you were always pleasant and tolerant of your step sister as kids if it took her several years and snooping to find out you didn\u2019t feel as strongly as her. It sounds like she\u2019s the only one who changed her behavior when she started being resentful and snarky. \n\nMom on the other hand, is the AH for trying to force her daughter/step daughter into a situation that neither wants, will definitely only create misery, for the sole purpose of appearances. And on that note, she can go beg your step sis to invite you herself if it\u2019s that important and then you can still decline.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA for this. You don't care about her and your feelings are yours. She snooped on your homework and found out the truth, that's not on you either unless you left it somewhere she could easily find it with the intention of her doing so. You do come across as a bit of an A for how little you think of her, despite how eager she was to be a sister to you; you could certainly have handled that a lot better.", "I don't think anyone is thr asshole here.  You made your feeling aware years ago.  U don't apologize so that's how u feel,  and honestly that's ok you don't have to be anything to her or for her, and as such she doesn't have to either.  I think you would agree.  So NTA", "NAH. I can empathize with your step sister. She thought she had a sibling and then found out she didn\u2019t. Not really your fault\u2026but that probably hurt bad.", "NTA. But your step sister deserves better than you fr", "[deleted]", "ESH - you both suck. It\u2019s YOUR fault she doesn\u2019t like you anymore , and it\u2019s HER day, not yours.", "[deleted]", "I noticed that nowhere in this did you mention that your feelings changed and you now consider her to be more of your sister than you did when you were 15.\n\nIf you still feel the same, that she's not your sister, you shouldn't care that you're not invited. It sounds as if there might be some FOMO going on, but aside from that, there is no reason for you to attend aside from your parents wishing the entire family could be there for the photos. Your absense from the photos will be a constant reminder that your relationship with your half sister is strained. But even that will fade in time as people get older and missing family gatherings becomes more common.\n\nYou hurt her feelings very badly at 15 and she had to go through a grieving process when she lost her BFF. She's probably had to emotionally build herself up over the years, especially considering that she still had to see you all of the time and had a constant reminder that you didn't care about her at all. While being around her is neutral for you, being around you is probably a negative stressor for her. I think not pressuring her to allow you to attend would be a mature recognition that you don't want to add stress to her big day, especially because I presume you don't care one way or the other.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she is a nice person who deserved a much better step sister than you.  \n\nYou don't have to attend the wedding if you don't want to.  It will probably be far better if you weren't there.\n\nNo idea why you are so resentful to her but strikes me that you were just mean to her for no other reason than you are horrible.", "ESH\n\nYou do you boo", "Nta for not begging to go to the wedding, but yta for how you treated her when you were kids.", "Yeah, YTA.  Not for the wedding thing, but for everything before it.", "NAH. You can both go about your own business as adults.\n\nArguably it's your mom who is most at fault here for trying to force the issue...", "Nah cause it's her wedding and she should have and have not who she wants there. But honestly you sound like a jerk. I get being 14 and writing something like that and her  having initial hurt feelings. Re the HW, don't know if she went into backpack or it was out or whatever,  but she was also a teen and trying for connection and to understand OP. \nBut I am going to guess that you were and are self absorbed. I can not imagine having a family member, by marriage, or even a friend, and being so callous as to never reopening the subject to allow the relationship to flourish or even to heal to where ever it goes. Maybe nowhere, maybe to friends as adults. Who knows. \nShe is right to not want you around. Your loss.", "Obviously this person means nothing to you even tho she desperately wants to love you and be loved by you as a sibling.  Its probably better that you don\u2019t go because then you don\u2019t have to pretend you care and she doesn\u2019t get her hopes up that you are being a caring, loving human being which obviously you aren\u2019t.", "Editing my comment to NTA because a kind person advised me to.

It really can't be associated with just teenage hormones, but a true reflection of you.  Oh well, at least everyone in your families will know the real you from your absence.", "NAH her wedding he choice. When your mom and Step dad pass into the after life wonder what the funerals would like.", "well,  you can\u2019t help who you love.\n\nI do feel sorry for her. She thought of you like a sister and you rejected her so she is lashing out because she is hurt.\n\nShe will get over it as you do come across as a cold person/Ice Queen type and your stepsister would be better off with a more warmer, caring type. Maybe this is for the best.\n\nI certainly won\u2019t say YTA, but I do think your stepsister can do better than you when it comes to choosing her family.", "You shouldn't beg especially if u don't want to go.

She nor your step dad appear to actually care about how either of you feel and that their selfish desire to simply appear like one happy family will actually cause more pain for the bride. I doubt that it's the first time. Unfortunately a lot of parents just expect the transition to go smoothly and that you will all be a happy family and so put zero effort into ensuring that it's done in a healthy way. Blended families require the adults to put in the work to blend it and ignore anyone who thinks you are ta because they inexplicably think you, as a child, should have just known how to navigate it better.

Especially how excited the step sister was she was 6 I can understand if she was excited to make a new friend but to instantly think they were gonna be siblings? I think someone was trying a little too hard to try to blend a family. I think what the mom is trying to pull now proves that they pushed too hard to have a blended family. I mean think about it. From the age of 6 I can see why a kid would be naive enough to think that someone would think of you as a sister just like you do, but when you starting hitting like 10-11 I feel like someone should know social cues of someone not liking them.

I would need more info about the step sister\u2019s behaviors and the family dynamic to really know for sure, but it\u2019s hard for me to fathom that growing up in a household with another child of similar age does not leave you with any feelings of endearment whatsoever. If you had included her when the three of you were younger, this probably would not be the \u201cfamily crisis\u201d your mom thinks it is now. \n\nSiblings tend to pair off in closer relationships, but that doesn\u2019t mean you leave the third one in the dust. \n\nHowever, as it stands, if you really have no feelings toward your step sister, I think there is nothing to be done here and it is a moot point.", "NTA this time but YTA for everything that happened before!", "NTA for the particular situation you are asking about.

She looked up to you, she adored you, she loved you, she considered you her sister, and then she found out that you just tolerated her. That hurts. You do not have any idea how she internally processed that in her young mind and heart. I'm sure she felt very rejected, and that's never good for anyone, and it doesn't sound like anyone helped her really process that.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by writing a story about the sister you adored.

I feel like if you were to call her and meet up it might be beneficial to you both. At least she'll feel that she is a little bit important to you. I'm always against reciprocating actions that separate people especially in situations where the underlying cause of that resent is pure love. Don't beg. Just meet up and talk.
