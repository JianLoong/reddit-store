No siblings on mom's side. My parents shared custody of me during my childhood but I always preferred dad's house. I was always closer to dad than to mom, and I always loved being around my sister.\n\nMy stepsister used to adore me and think we were sister's and BFFs forever. She had no siblings so to her I was that sibling. We were about 14 and 15 when she found out I didn't feel the same way about her. She read my homework one night and I had to write a personal piece from a topic of choices (the choices were basically different family members/relationship types and I went with siblings). She was really upset after learning I didn't consider her one of my siblings and never did. She stopped being so into me after that which wasn't a big deal to me. She grew more resentful of me when we were in our very early 20s because I moved into an apartment with my sister which she learned about from my mom. The few times I saw her after that she was always very snarky when asking if I liked having a sister that much and how nice it must be to be loved back.\n\nMy stepsister is now getting married and she didn't send me an invite. It upset my mom and her husband a lot and they asked why and she told them I'm not her sister, I don't give a crap about her and she doesn't want me there. My mom told me I should ask her to invite me and beg if I have to. She told me otherwise it will look so awful and like we're not a family.\n\nI refused.

Said sister has NO other sisters so she went full into treating you like a real sister.   \n\n\nWhen she found out that feeling wasn't reciprocated she began to resent you and has never stopped.  \n\n\nI think she probably wants you to ask to be included as it would be satisfying and vindicating for her.  \n\n\nI can also understand why you'd never swallow your pride and do that.  \n\n\nI think NAH here, actually.

You were under no obligation to love your stepsis and we don't even know if your mom and stepdad took the necessary precautions when forming a blended family - lots of people just shove the kids together and hope they get along. It sucks that your stepsister found out the hard way and it sucks that she's been resentful of you ever since, but I don't think you're an AH for that. And neither is she, because it's her wedding and she has the right to invite (or not invite) anyone she wants to.

Likewise my brother didn\u2019t invite her or our step-brother to either of his weddings. Nobody batted an eyelid.\n\nIf you managed to get an invite you\u2019d know the bride doesn\u2019t really want you there, and you don\u2019t really want to be there.

Sometimes you can't control other people, and subsequently public impressions.\n\nI'm assuming this wasn't a failure on their part and just the way it was.  You can't fake feelings, and no one is at fault that you just didn't feel close to her.  Anyone who genuinely loves them should understand that.  If anyone doesn't, maybe it should be rethought whether or not you want to be close enough to them for a wedding invite.", "I think you picked your subject matter based on your dislike for your step. And not sure but your sister by your dad only would she be a half-sister? Nothing wrong with that. But I have been trying to sort who is who. No idea why you don\u2019t care for your step that much considering she use to adore you. Not bullying you, accepting you. You could have written about your dad with a positive approach but went after your step with a negative approach. And no idea if you left your homework out hoping she reads it. I think your step is justified in feeling how she feels. But would be nice if she could extend the invite and just hope you both stay out of each other\u2019s way and you don\u2019t try to act hostile. If you can\u2019t behave properly best you aren\u2019t there. As to your begging, nobody should beg for any invitation. So based on just that fact alone, NTA.  But have to wonder if you are one and have been one with your step.", "NAH. The mom doesnt need to force anything", "I'm going to go with NAH. I don't think the mother is in the right, but I can understand why it would upset her that OP is not invited if she considers them all to be family. Weird to ask OP to beg though but I get the fact she brought it up. The step sister is not an AH because she shouldn't be obligated to invite anyone to a wedding she doesn't want there, and OP is not an AH for refusing to beg because she doesn't want to go and that's generally a bad plan. Without knowing any more context about the family in general and if anyone has actively been an AH to anyone else at any point (I can totally see why it sucked for the stepsister to find out she wasn't considered a sister but equally she snooped), then it just seems like a fairly unfortunate situation.", "NAH - except maybe mom. Sounds like you were always pleasant and tolerant of your step sister as kids if it took her several years and snooping to find out you didn\u2019t feel as strongly as her. It sounds like she\u2019s the only one who changed her behavior when she started being resentful and snarky. \n\nMom on the other hand, is the AH for trying to force her daughter/step daughter into a situation that neither wants, will definitely only create misery, for the sole purpose of appearances. And on that note, she can go beg your step sis to invite you herself if it\u2019s that important and then you can still decline.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA for this. You don't care about her and your feelings are yours. She snooped on your homework and found out the truth, that's not on you either unless you left it somewhere she could easily find it with the intention of her doing so. You do come across as a bit of an A for how little you think of her, despite how eager she was to be a sister to you; you could certainly have handled that a lot better.", "I don't think anyone is thr asshole here.  You made your feeling aware years ago.  U don't apologize so that's how u feel,  and honestly that's ok you don't have to be anything to her or for her, and as such she doesn't have to either.  I think you would agree.  So NTA", "NAH. I can empathize with your step sister. She thought she had a sibling and then found out she didn\u2019t.

But your step sister deserves better than you fr", "YTA just generally could have treated the situation way better all around.", "ESH - you both suck.

It sounds as if there might be some FOMO going on, but aside from that, there is no reason for you to attend aside from your parents wishing the entire family could be there for the photos. Your absense from the photos will be a constant reminder that your relationship with your half sister is strained. But even that will fade in time as people get older and missing family gatherings becomes more common.\n\nYou hurt her feelings very badly at 15 and she had to go through a grieving process when she lost her BFF. She's probably had to emotionally build herself up over the years, especially considering that she still had to see you all of the time and had a constant reminder that you didn't care about her at all. While being around her is neutral for you, being around you is probably a negative stressor for her. I think not pressuring her to allow you to attend would be a mature recognition that you don't want to add stress to her big day, especially because I presume you don't care one way or the other.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she is a nice person who deserved a much better step sister than you.  \n\nYou don't have to attend the wedding if you don't want to.  It will probably be far better if you weren't there.\n\nNo idea why you are so resentful to her but strikes me that you were just mean to her for no other reason than you are horrible.", "ESH\n\nYou do you boo", "Nta for not begging to go to the wedding, but yta for how you treated her when you were kids.", "Yeah, YTA.  Not for the wedding thing, but for everything before it.", "NAH. You can both go about your own business as adults.\n\nArguably it's your mom who is most at fault here for trying to force the issue...", "Nah cause it's her wedding and she should have and have not who she wants there. But honestly you sound like a jerk. I get being 14 and writing something like that and her  having initial hurt feelings. Re the HW, don't know if she went into backpack or it was out or whatever,  but she was also a teen and trying for connection and to understand OP. \nBut I am going to guess that you were and are self absorbed. I can not imagine having a family member, by marriage, or even a friend, and being so callous as to never reopening the subject to allow the relationship to flourish or even to heal to where ever it goes. Maybe nowhere, maybe to friends as adults. Who knows. \nShe is right to not want you around. Your loss.", "Obviously this person means nothing to you even tho she desperately wants to love you and be loved by you as a sibling.

When your mom and Step dad pass into the after life wonder what the funerals would like.", "well,  you can\u2019t help who you love.\n\nI do feel sorry for her. She thought of you like a sister and you rejected her so she is lashing out because she is hurt.\n\nShe will get over it as you do come across as a cold person/Ice Queen type and your stepsister would be better off with a more warmer, caring type.

Just correcting people who think I told her I didn't care about her or people who think I wrote in my homework that I don't consider her a sibling. None of that happened. I wrote about my sister. The way I wrote about her and what I said about only having one sibling was made it obvious to my stepsister. I didn't go out of my way to do anything. I just wanted to clarify that because at least to me, it's different.", "Did you expect OP to lie about having sibling affection she didn\u2019t have for step sis to spare her feelings?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP changed her behaviour after. It\u2019s just step sister had her rose coloured glasses taken off and the pendulum swung the other way.", "[deleted]", "You wrote that you only have one sibling, which clearly wasn't her but you don't think you wrote that you don't consider her a sibling? What sort of mental gymnastics is that?", "I totally get why. I know when you care about someone and they don't care about you, it hurts. Add in that she considered us sister's and she really loved me. I do get it. I always got it. I also knew it would hurt her feelings if she knew so I always tried to be nice and spend some time with her. But it never meant to me what it did to her.", "I didn't write those words specifically. I didn't mention her at all in the homework. Which yeah, it says a lot without saying anything directly. But I wasn't sitting down to write about how she's not, if that makes sense. The homework was about my sister and how much I loved her and loved having her in my life."]}
