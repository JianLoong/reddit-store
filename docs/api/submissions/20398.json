I told her I will cut down on the meat but it is unreasonable of her to expect me to go completely vegetarian for her comfort. \n\nNate called me and said Trudy is using his share of the house and she is entitled to not have to smell meat while she\u2019s so uncomfortable. I told Nate I\u2019m also entitled to cook whatever I want in my own house.

He invited a woman you barely know to *live in your house*, without even asking you if it is okay! I understand he partially owns the house, but you are the one living there. It's just a respect thing as most people don't feel comfortable living with near strangers.\n\nSo not only is this woman imposing on your home and not paying for it, but she is also asking you to completely change your way of living because she can't handle the smell of people cooking normal food. Absolutely not. If she doesn't like it, she can find somewhere else to live. Or light a candle. Some people. NTA.", "I find it kind of odd and, in my opinion, way out of line for your brother to just send someone to live in your house whom you barely know. He didn't even ask, just told you. Sure, you set aside a room in your home for when he visits, but that doesn't give him a right to essentially sublet that room to someone else. Sure, it's technically his home as well since both of you inherited it, but it sounds like he didn't even consult you since you're the one living there and he's not. So, this affects you, not him.\n\nSecond, Trudy is presumably living there rent free by the sound of things. If she wants an entirely meat-free household, then she can go rent an apartment by herself. She's WFH, so she has a job. I'm sure she can afford it. She doesn't get to use her pregnancy to dictate your diet in your own home while she's living there for free.\n\nNTA OP. She needs to knock off that entitled attitude, otherwise I'd tell her to find some other living arrangement. She doesn't get to dictate what you do in your own home, especially while living there rent free.\n\nTrudy and Nate are definitely AH, though. They both just sound pretty entitled.\n\nETA: I also want to add that if Nate is so upset about you cooking meat in your own home and it\u2019s negatively affecting Trudy, why doesn\u2019t HE have Trudy live with him? Why doesn\u2019t HE change his diet to vegetarian to accommodate Trudy? I think we can all guess why.", "NTA - 1) your brother \u201ctold\u201d you his SIL was moving in, not asked you? That is not ok from the very start. As co-owners you both get a say who lives in the house. This is a basic thing. 2) Pregnancy is hard and morning sickness sucks (been there, done that). You can make reasonable accommodations (opening a window, cleaning dishes right away) but to say you can\u2019t cook any meat is unreasonable. \n\nIt may be time to talk about one of you buying the other out or selling the house outright and splitting the profit, you can use it to purchase a home you own by yourself. Your brother does not seem to understand the meaning of co-ownership and it may get worse as time goes on as his fianc\u00e9 and her family now feel entitled to the property as well.\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA. It's your house too. See if turning on a fan or a vent will help clear out the smell. Depending on how hot it is, maybe Trudy can open a window until you finish cooking.", "Nta, someone else's pregnancy, especially your brother's SIL, shouldn't dictate your diet.", "NTA - your brother is wrong if he thinks she's entitled to dictate what kind of food you prepare for yourself. She's entitled to decide what kind of food SHE eats.\n\nNot smoking in the house or something is one thing and if there was some sort of allergy involved, you could make the argument. But a complete ban on meat is totally unreasonable.", "NTA.. Your brother is just the 3rd in line after your SIL's sister hit a brick wall with you and complained to SIL who in turn ripped on your brother to take care of it. She's a guest in your home. If she has an issue with what you're cooking for yourself in your own home then she can find another place to reside.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, not Trudy's. Your brother doesn't get to stick you with a rando and expect you to cater to her whims.  I'd also be VERY curious about their plans for what happens when the baby comes because I don't think Trudy's going anywhere.", "NTA. It would be unreasonable to expect you to stop eating meat. You can use the vent and open the kitchen window when cooking. That should help with the odor.", "NTA.\n\nWhile her condition is valid and it sucks for her, it is not your responsibility to cater to her needs.", "NTA\n\nI had smell aversions to cooking meat when I was pregnant, but I dealt with it myself. Smelling meat will not adversely affect the baby she's carrying, and there is no guarantee morning sickness will ever go away.\n\nOpen a window and use a fan when cooking meat.\n\nYou can also find out if it is specific meat that bothers her...mine was primarily ground beef. Might be able to work around that \\*IF\\* you want to do so.", "NTA! You're doing her a favor, as is Nate. While I get she's dealing with morning sickness (Been there myself), it IS unreasonable to expect someone to stop cooking the foods they enjoy in their own home. If it's so horrible, perhaps she should find other living arrangements sooner than later and/or buy an air purifier and a fan to reduce the smells that make her nauseous. You've already opened up your home to an acquaintance and yes, she is paying rent, but it's still YOUR home. Nate can have a say or whatever, but he's not there on a daily basis, so I say this is your home primarily.  NTA!", "Info: Why are they waiting for her to have the baby before preparing another place for her? Wouldn\u2019t she want to be settled into a new place before the baby comes?", "NTA. She\u2019s a guest there who you didn\u2019t invite. She doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do in your own home.

She\u2019s the one who is choosing to have a baby by a jerk.", "NTA Morning sickness doesn't go away in a week. And as I recall, what smells trigger it change. I did not expect anyone to cater to my triggers. You can let Trudy know when you're going to prepare food and she can leave the house or stay in her room. You don't need to re-order your life because your brother's girlfriends's sister is staying the house you and your brother own while she's pregnant.", "Nta might be time to say she has to move out soon", "I recently bought an odor eliminating candle (clean burning soy wax, safe around pets). I was looking for a chef's candle (that's a thing!) and my research led me to this candle that's for all odors, specifically including cooking. Game changer! Between that and the hood vent, we're able to eliminate most of the smells. My Mom (post-menopausal) has a permanent pregnancy level hyperosmia so we have tried many things over decades, and regular candles while cooking can only do so much. Febreze now also has a kitchen odor eliminator spray.\n\nNot saying you need to change anything for this sudden housemate you have, but just because knowledge is power.", "I have to say NTA, I had severe morning sickness both of my pregnancies. For my first the smell of a lot of cooking made me actually vomit to the point I was dehydrated and my face swelled. That can be very dangerous and my husband had to stop baking/roasting meat (microwaving and steaming was okay/less smelly) and I could not smell garlic at all without vomiting. My second pregnancy the smells made me uncomfortable and I vomited a bit but not to the dangerous level of my first so I was glad he didn\u2019t have to change his cooking. If she\u2019s not vomiting therefore the smells aren\u2019t causing harm to her or the child then you should be able to cook meat.", "NTA", "NTA. Not your partner, not your baby, not your family, not her house. Cook all the meat all the time and hopefully she'll move out.", "NTA - She can stay in her room or something.", "NAH\n\nWhile you and Nate own the house jointly, you are not obligated to make changes to your life/routine because he's chosen to sublet his 'half'.  It would be like you renting out your half while Nate was living there, and the renter has to get up really early for work, but Nate has band practice at the house some nights, so the renter wants Nate to stop practicing past a certain time.\n\nIn both situations, the requests could be accommodated, but you're under no obligation.\n\nBut...let's say whomever you're living with is making the house smell of something that turns your stomach - some really strong incense, or stinky cheese or fish, etc.  Smell typically can't be contained to just one part of the house; air is a 'shared space'.  Are you entitled to not have to smell something that you find unpleasant?  I really don't know, which is why I said no AH here.\n\nThe only solution besides her moving out, or you putting a hiatus on cooking meat in the house, is compromise, which you are willing to do by cutting down on the meat cooking.  You and Trudy could coordinate where if it's a meat night, she goes out for a while (it's not your fault that she's there all the time).  Maybe you can cook a couple meals' worth at a time and have leftovers.  Can you grill outside?  All that combined with a couple extra meatless days is more than a reasonable effort.  Do you have to make the effort?  No.  Is it the nice thing to do for someone going through a tough time?  I'd say yes.", "NAH. Just FYI, its very possible this isn't an entire pregnancy situation.

Is there a lease? A rental agreement?  First and last months rent?

The argument would be that the OP did not sign up to live with someone else. But she got the house for free, as did Nate.

Why would she? She's living rent free! Set the date soon because once she starts showing, she'll use that as an excuse to not leave. And then when she's closer to having the baby, that will be the excuse. And when the baby is actually there, that will be the excuse. Take care of it NOW. Also, if you are financially able, ide buy out your brother.

Sure, it was technically his home, but by the sounds of it, he didn't really live there in the first place, and didn't really sound like he consulted OP about it. Just sort of, sent Trudy there.

Just because he is a co-owner does not mean he can make unilateral decisions regarding who lives there, or renting out part of the space.

Part of being a co-owner of something means you consult the other co-owner and make joint decisions.\n\nThey got the house for free, yes, as an inheritance. So, I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make here. It's their home, they can decide who can and cannot live there as a joint decision.\n\nThis is kind of a false equivalency comparing it to the situation at hand.

In the situation OP is presenting, Trudy does not have any standing to make such demands.", "Partial homeowner.

However, my point being is that Nate made a unilateral decision about someone living there without consulting OP, the other co-owner of the home. If Nate lived at the house, which he doesn't, maaaybe he might have had a stronger say. But, he doesn't. This decision in practially no way affects him. Being a co-owner means consulting the other person and making joint decisions.\n\nMy other point is it does not sound like Trudy is contributing any sort of rent to the home. Roommate implies that they are contributing in some way financially to the housing costs, which she is not. It could be considered that Trudy is a long-term houseguest based on their relationship and does not have standing to dictate such things.", "Whether they're a couple, siblings, or roommates--and regardless of whether they rent, own, or sublet--common sense and courtesy requires approval before a new person moves in.

I couldn't smell or eat meat for most of the pregnancy. It took about two years to eat chicken again after without feeling nauseous. It has nothing to do with cooking it in a way to be smelly. If it's cooked inside she will smell it.", "Luckily, owner-occupied tenancy has some special immunities to some tenant law.\n\nOP should research her local rules", "Totally missed that line!", "It's highly variable -- not only by locality, but also because the owner with whom this person established a tenancy agreement doesn't live there.  Does that latter fact matter?  I suspect it strongly depends on locality.", "Very true about locality.  This is also a complicated situation.\n\nOverall, I'd say NTA about the meat, though.", "Ummm that isnt how it works. The law stipulates which decisions can be unilateral and whh can be joint.

Just because half is his does not give him the right to invite other people to live in his half.  Is she really going to leave when the baby comes?  What if not?  You need to have a sit down with him and set boundaries.", "Nta It\u2019s your house and she\u2019s a tenant.

You've been very accommodating already, but this is too far, you cannot be expected to go vegan just because of her morning sickness.\n\nIf Nate expects to be able to give away a room in the house whenever he wants, then the two of you need to come to an agreement on selling the house or one of you buying the other out.", "NTA, I have several medical issues and one of the big constant symptoms is nausea. My roommate's brew a giant pot of coffee every morning and frankly it kills my soul. The smell makes me nauseous AF and it's a horrible way to start my day. That being said I would never dream to dictate what other people do in their home. So I suck it up and sometimes I wake up early enough to take nausea medicine before they get up. It's my problem. Her accidental pregnancy is her problem. If you want to be generous, you can always warn her when you intend to cook me so that she can air out the house, turn on a fan, or go out for the evening.", "NTA. Ngl the fact that she went and tattled to try and force you would make me work very hard to incorporate meat in all my meals if I were you. Yes I\u2019m petty", "NTA. She's not an owner of the home like your brother is. She's just a guest. Seeing as she is WFH why can't she just live with your brother and her sister?", "Give her some crackers to naw on while you cook your meat in your own home\u2026. And tell your brother this just isn\u2019t going to work out", "I can see the brother continuing with his line of thinking and Op will end up living with a newborn baby, \"because it's my half of the house I say they both can stay\" . Op needs to stand up for her self now before this turns bad for her", "Because the future arrangement is going to be ousting OP from the house so Trust and the baby can have it.", "I know that was a misspelling on Trusy, but I have to admit, I chuckled at \"turdy\"", "There are two types of joint ownership that I know of, I'm not sure if there are other types as well. \n\n1) Each owner owns 50% (or whatever % as set forth in the legal ownership) of the property. Owner can rent, sell etc their half without permission from other owner. In this situation, OP has no say on whether Nate has someone staying in \"his half\" of the house. \n\n2) Each owner owns 100% of the house. Many married couples have this type of ownership. Basically in this situation both owner must make decisions about renting/ selling together. So in this situation Nate cannot move a person in to the house against OPs wishes. \n\n>When two people decide to rent a home together, there is a contract. These two have no contract. If OP doesn\u2019t like the situation, she can move somewhere else.\n\nThere is a legal document of ownership that does specify what Nate and OP can do about the house in the event of disagreement. It's not a \"contract\" in the sense of renting (also you can put whatever you want in a contract and sign it but it might not be legally binding), but it doesn't mean Nate isn't bound by legal ownership rules about what he can do without other owner's agreement. If OP doesn't like the situation, it is likely in their legal rights to evict Nate's guest, depending on how their ownership is set up when they inherited the house. \n\n>But would we expect Nate to stop cooking meat if the OP was the one who was pregnant?\n\nNo, I would not. If Nate lived in the house with OP and they are both owners then no. If a guest of Nate lived in the house and OP wanted them to stop cooking meat then it's a similar situation to now, so maybe OP can evict the guest if she does not want them to stay there.", "No.", "So by saying that, then the pregnant one can learn to live with it, or she can move. It's not her house.", "NAH. If she spoke up, she\u2019s probably getting really sick from the smells. Pregnancy makes your sense of smell go out of control. Yes, it\u2019s your house, but she\u2019s gestating an entire person. Can you use a grill on the back porch? One of my adult kids is a vegetarian. I\u2019m not. When she visits, I order meat from food apps (something about cooking meat permeates everything), or cook it outside. NBD.", "NTA. If she doesn't like cooking smells, have her sister find her that \"new place\" NOW instead of continuing to impose on your living space. Cook your meat, hell, microwave your seafood if that's what it takes to get this freeloader out of your hair!", "Nta BUUUUUT maybe try to compromise with her. I remember my morning sickness and it fucking sucked. I feel bad for my ex husbands family cuz I asked no seafood or meat. Of course they couldn\u2019t do that all the time and I suffered but they tried.", "You are using your share of the kitchen to which you are entitled. NTA", "Nta did he ask if you were OK with having a roommate or tell you you were going to have a roommate? That's fucked up enough, but her pregnancy isn't your problem", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to cook in your share of the house. She\u2019s a guest. She has no rights to make demands on anyone being gracious enough to allow her to stay. Not to mention that she\u2019s not even paying her own way, so she has even less of a right to complain.", "NTA\n\nShe can find another place to live if she doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not your responsibility to change how you live to accommodate her pregnancy. Your brother is the AH for just telling you she\u2019s going to live there instead of asking you. You\u2019re not running a boarding home. You might want to consider buying out his half of the house. I doubt him and his soon to be wife will want to be roommates with you in a small house", "NTA. They have no right to force you to let her move in with you. Then they say you have to give in to her demands for her half of the house, which isn't hers. She can move in with Ops brother and then they can choose to not eat meat and cater to her whims if they want to. \n\nTHe brother feels way to comfortable with telling the sister what she has to do. I swear joint ownership always turns into a problems. Probably best in terms of avoiding issues of control, who lives there and money to just sell and split cash and put towards your own places, or raise cash to buy the other half out.\n\nOP needs to raise concerns with brother, like if op was renting the place the landlord couldn't just move in whoever they wanted and it's completely unreasonable to expect someone to live while having no control of their living space. Consider an agreement where you are basically considered the tenant and separately you two are joint landlords. YOu can make decisions on the upkeep or selling/keeping the house, but it's your home and you get to say who is there and when.", "Spot on. I\u2019m petty so I\u2019d probably cook meat every day to force her to find other accommodations because this lady is not leaving once the baby comes.", "I just want to say that both my kids made me go vegetarian when I was pregnant.  The first one meat just didn\u2019t taste good and the second one meat made me feel sick.", ">FYI, this person is now a legal tenant with real tenant protections. \n\nThat may or may not be the case. The OP should seek advice from a legal professional or reputable housing advice resource, but no one here can say what the law is without knowing where the OP is.\n\nWhere I'm from, the OP as a live-in owner occupier could chuck her out with no formal eviction process and an obligation to give only \"reasonable notice\", which would probably be maybe a week, and certainly less than a month.", "I would start to ask for details on that move out date. They said once the baby is born they'll find her a place but she won't be able to move right before or after the birth. I'd start pushing for her to move out around 6 months or so (disclaimer: I've never been pregnant, that may be too late so ask others for sure). That'd give time for her to settle and set up a nursery and oh isn't that wonderful for her....and you because she'll be gone.\n\nFor meat in the house, I agree that she shouldn't be able to ban you from cooking meat. I don't think your response was bad but I don't fault her for asking if it is making her nauseous. If she can wfh, why can't she move to your brother's?", "You\u2019re renting, so the landlord is the person who decides who lives there. Your lease presumably spells that out. In the OP\u2019s situation, she\u2019s co-owner and legally has veto power."]}
