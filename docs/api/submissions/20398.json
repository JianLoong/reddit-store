He invited a woman you barely know to *live in your house*, without even asking you if it is okay! I understand he partially owns the house, but you are the one living there. It's just a respect thing as most people don't feel comfortable living with near strangers.\n\nSo not only is this woman imposing on your home and not paying for it, but she is also asking you to completely change your way of living because she can't handle the smell of people cooking normal food. Absolutely not. If she doesn't like it, she can find somewhere else to live. Or light a candle. Some people. NTA.", "I find it kind of odd and, in my opinion, way out of line for your brother to just send someone to live in your house whom you barely know. He didn't even ask, just told you. Sure, you set aside a room in your home for when he visits, but that doesn't give him a right to essentially sublet that room to someone else. Sure, it's technically his home as well since both of you inherited it, but it sounds like he didn't even consult you since you're the one living there and he's not. So, this affects you, not him.\n\nSecond, Trudy is presumably living there rent free by the sound of things. If she wants an entirely meat-free household, then she can go rent an apartment by herself. She's WFH, so she has a job. I'm sure she can afford it. She doesn't get to use her pregnancy to dictate your diet in your own home while she's living there for free.\n\nNTA OP. She needs to knock off that entitled attitude, otherwise I'd tell her to find some other living arrangement. She doesn't get to dictate what you do in your own home, especially while living there rent free.\n\nTrudy and Nate are definitely AH, though. They both just sound pretty entitled.", "NTA - 1) your brother \u201ctold\u201d you his SIL was moving in, not asked you? That is not ok from the very start. As co-owners you both get a say who lives in the house. This is a basic thing. 2) Pregnancy is hard and morning sickness sucks (been there, done that). You can make reasonable accommodations (opening a window, cleaning dishes right away) but to say you can\u2019t cook any meat is unreasonable. \n\nIt may be time to talk about one of you buying the other out or selling the house outright and splitting the profit, you can use it to purchase a home you own by yourself. Your brother does not seem to understand the meaning of co-ownership and it may get worse as time goes on as his fianc\u00e9 and her family now feel entitled to the property as well.\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA. It's your house too. See if turning on a fan or a vent will help clear out the smell. Depending on how hot it is, maybe Trudy can open a window until you finish cooking.", "Nta, someone else's pregnancy, especially your brother's SIL, shouldn't dictate your diet.", "NTA - your brother is wrong if he thinks she's entitled to dictate what kind of food you prepare for yourself. She's entitled to decide what kind of food SHE eats.\n\nNot smoking in the house or something is one thing and if there was some sort of allergy involved, you could make the argument. But a complete ban on meat is totally unreasonable.", "NTA.. Your brother is just the 3rd in line after your SIL's sister hit a brick wall with you and complained to SIL who in turn ripped on your brother to take care of it. She's a guest in your home. If she has an issue with what you're cooking for yourself in your own home then she can find another place to reside.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, not Trudy's. Your brother doesn't get to stick you with a rando and expect you to cater to her whims.  I'd also be VERY curious about their plans for what happens when the baby comes because I don't think Trudy's going anywhere.", "NTA. It would be unreasonable to expect you to stop eating meat. You can use the vent and open the kitchen window when cooking. That should help with the odor.", "NTA.\n\nWhile her condition is valid and it sucks for her, it is not your responsibility to cater to her needs.", "NTA\n\nI had smell aversions to cooking meat when I was pregnant, but I dealt with it myself. Smelling meat will not adversely affect the baby she's carrying, and there is no guarantee morning sickness will ever go away.\n\nOpen a window and use a fan when cooking meat.\n\nYou can also find out if it is specific meat that bothers her...mine was primarily ground beef. Might be able to work around that \\*IF\\* you want to do so.", "NTA! You're doing her a favor, as is Nate. While I get she's dealing with morning sickness (Been there myself), it IS unreasonable to expect someone to stop cooking the foods they enjoy in their own home. If it's so horrible, perhaps she should find other living arrangements sooner than later and/or buy an air purifier and a fan to reduce the smells that make her nauseous. You've already opened up your home to an acquaintance and yes, she is paying rent, but it's still YOUR home. Nate can have a say or whatever, but he's not there on a daily basis, so I say this is your home primarily.  NTA!", "Info: Why are they waiting for her to have the baby before preparing another place for her? Wouldn\u2019t she want to be settled into a new place before the baby comes?", "NTA. She\u2019s a guest there who you didn\u2019t invite. She doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do in your own home. If she\u2019s unhappy with what you cook she can find somewhere else to live.", "Fuck that. I wouldn\u2019t reduce cooking meat even a little bit. She\u2019s the one who is choosing to have a baby by a jerk.", "NTA Morning sickness doesn't go away in a week. And as I recall, what smells trigger it change. I did not expect anyone to cater to my triggers. You can let Trudy know when you're going to prepare food and she can leave the house or stay in her room. You don't need to re-order your life because your brother's girlfriends's sister is staying the house you and your brother own while she's pregnant.", "Nta might be time to say she has to move out soon", "I recently bought an odor eliminating candle (clean burning soy wax, safe around pets). I was looking for a chef's candle (that's a thing!) and my research led me to this candle that's for all odors, specifically including cooking. Game changer! Between that and the hood vent, we're able to eliminate most of the smells. My Mom (post-menopausal) has a permanent pregnancy level hyperosmia so we have tried many things over decades, and regular candles while cooking can only do so much. Febreze now also has a kitchen odor eliminator spray.\n\nNot saying you need to change anything for this sudden housemate you have, but just because knowledge is power.", "I have to say NTA, I had severe morning sickness both of my pregnancies. For my first the smell of a lot of cooking made me actually vomit to the point I was dehydrated and my face swelled. That can be very dangerous and my husband had to stop baking/roasting meat (microwaving and steaming was okay/less smelly) and I could not smell garlic at all without vomiting. My second pregnancy the smells made me uncomfortable and I vomited a bit but not to the dangerous level of my first so I was glad he didn\u2019t have to change his cooking. If she\u2019s not vomiting therefore the smells aren\u2019t causing harm to her or the child then you should be able to cook meat.", "NTA", "NTA. Not your partner, not your baby, not your family, not her house. Cook all the meat all the time and hopefully she'll move out.", "NTA - She can stay in her room or something.", "NAH\n\nWhile you and Nate own the house jointly, you are not obligated to make changes to your life/routine because he's chosen to sublet his 'half'.  It would be like you renting out your half while Nate was living there, and the renter has to get up really early for work, but Nate has band practice at the house some nights, so the renter wants Nate to stop practicing past a certain time.\n\nIn both situations, the requests could be accommodated, but you're under no obligation.\n\nBut...let's say whomever you're living with is making the house smell of something that turns your stomach - some really strong incense, or stinky cheese or fish, etc.  Smell typically can't be contained to just one part of the house; air is a 'shared space'.  Are you entitled to not have to smell something that you find unpleasant?  I really don't know, which is why I said no AH here.\n\nThe only solution besides her moving out, or you putting a hiatus on cooking meat in the house, is compromise, which you are willing to do by cutting down on the meat cooking.  You and Trudy could coordinate where if it's a meat night, she goes out for a while (it's not your fault that she's there all the time).  Maybe you can cook a couple meals' worth at a time and have leftovers.  Can you grill outside?  All that combined with a couple extra meatless days is more than a reasonable effort.  Do you have to make the effort?  No.  Is it the nice thing to do for someone going through a tough time?  I'd say yes.", "NAH. Just FYI, its very possible this isn't an entire pregnancy situation. I think as long as y'all try to be reasonable roommates no AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother may have claim to a portion of the house, he does /should not sole decision of what happens in the house - at the very least it should have been a discussion between you and your brother!  Is there a lease? A rental agreement?  First and last months rent? Security deposit - if they didn\u2019t discuss this beforehand, they don\u2019t get a say in how you live or act now.  \nOther  concerns are the baby and the baby\u2019s father.  Do they get to stay as well??? Next you will be asked to tiptoe around to\u201dnot wake the baby\u201d, and forget having parties, dinners or get- togethers.

Your brother has put you in a horrible position!", "Interesting point. I\u2019m not sure if I agree or not. I definitely see your points. But I also feel that Nate is a homeowner just like the OP. He could conceivably rent his share the house out to whoever he wants, which is what this is. \n\nIf they were renting from a landlord and simply paying rent , then I would agree with you 100%. The argument would be that the OP did not sign up to live with someone else. But she got the house for free, as did Nate. I\u2019m honestly torn.\n\nAlso, what if OP had gotten pregnant and NATE was the one cooking meat; would that change anything? One could argue that it\u2019s not the Nate\u2019s fault that the sister is pregnant (unless in AL :)\n\nI can\u2019t make a judgment.", ">you both get a say who lives in the house\n\nI would argue that OP gets a bigger say who lives in the house as she's the one actually stuck with Trudy and her brother is a few hours away.", "I agree a buyout or selling the place might be the best solution for OP. Especially since there's no guarantee that she won't be stuck living with a cryimg baby once it arrives. There needs to be a settled date for the woman to move out.\n\nAs for the roommate, she or her sister or Nate can buy an air cleaner for her. \n\nOP is NTA", "I would set a move out date right now because she is absolutely not leaving. Why would she? She's living rent free! Set the date soon because once she starts showing, she'll use that as an excuse to not leave. And then when she's closer to having the baby, that will be the excuse. And when the baby is actually there, that will be the excuse. Take care of it NOW. Also, if you are financially able, ide buy out your brother. He is completely disrespecting you.", "Most likely that was a lie and they plan to have OP deal with living with a baby.", "Idk, I kind of feel like wasn't Nate's place to house someone in another person's home without really asking. Sure, it was technically his home, but by the sounds of it, he didn't really live there in the first place, and didn't really sound like he consulted OP about it. Just sort of, sent Trudy there. I feel like that deserves some sort of AH rating.\n\nUnless OP states it, I also assume Trudy is staying there rent free, so I don't believe she has any standing or position to really say what OP can and can't cook in their own home.", "Well, to be fair, Nate owns half the house and is letting the SIL stay there in his place so he really doesn't need the OP's permission about who he rents/sublets/whatevers too.  It would be nice if he ran it by his sister and it isn't like he rented it out to a random serial killer. And it doesn't sound like the OP objected until the SIL became unreasonable.\n\nBut I totally get what you are saying, I do see lots of those as well.", "Yes, he also partially owns the home, but as does OP. Just because he is a co-owner does not mean he can make unilateral decisions regarding who lives there, or renting out part of the space. Especially when he does not live there, but one of the co-owners (OP) does. Part of being a co-owner of something means you consult the other co-owner and make joint decisions.\n\nThey got the house for free, yes, as an inheritance. So, I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make here. It's their home, they can decide who can and cannot live there as a joint decision.\n\nThis is kind of a false equivalency comparing it to the situation at hand. In your scenario they're both own the home, so they can both have a say. They both have some stance in the home. In the situation OP is presenting, Trudy does not have any standing to make such demands.", "Partial homeowner. OP is also a homeowner, and her opinion is also important when bringing in a stranger into the house. She was fine with it, and her brother was sure she would just agree.\n\nFrom the info provided turdy made no attempt to get to know OP and now is asking the other landlord to limit herself in her home.\n\nJust like you said OP got it for free, brother also got it for free.", "I agree, as the person who is residing there she should get a veto power for sure. The whole thing is just wrong. This is why co-owning a house with a sibling is never a good idea.", "Amen sister/brother/sibling of non-determined gender!!!\n\nAlso, OP, this seems like an amazing weekend for a barbecue!!", "That's where this is headed. Then it'll be \"change this because of the baby\" and possibly the father coming over and never leaving, OP should help out and babysit, etc. \n\nI say a buyout is the best plan.", "Co-Owners are co-owners. Trudy has to be seen as an agent of Nate. \n\nRoommates have standing to tell roommates if they are doing something thats causing them dis-ease.", "I don\u2019t think living in the home makes a difference. He also owns the home. I don\u2019t know why they both can\u2019t make certain unilateral decisions. Neither one of them paid for the home, as such; there was no agreement. \n\nWhen two people decide to rent a home together, there is a contract.  These two have no contract.  If OP doesn\u2019t like the situation, she can move somewhere else.\n\nBut would we expect Nate to stop cooking meat if the OP was the one who was pregnant?", "Right, they are co-owners. However, my point being is that Nate made a unilateral decision about someone living there without consulting OP, the other co-owner of the home. If Nate lived at the house, which he doesn't, maaaybe he might have had a stronger say. But, he doesn't. This decision in practially no way affects him. Being a co-owner means consulting the other person and making joint decisions.\n\nMy other point is it does not sound like Trudy is contributing any sort of rent to the home. Roommate implies that they are contributing in some way financially to the housing costs, which she is not. It could be considered that Trudy is a long-term houseguest based on their relationship and does not have standing to dictate such things.", "Whether they're a couple, siblings, or roommates--and regardless of whether they rent, own, or sublet--common sense and courtesy requires approval before a new person moves in. For safety sake if nothing else. \n\nWorst case scenario has her brother offering up his room to someone who's been stalking OP. Is that his \"right\" as an owner? Don't think so.\n\nOP and her brother need to craft a contract to set the ground rules.", "It does make a difference because this unilateral decision made by Nate affects only OP's living situation, not Nate's. Could you honestly say you'd be okay with some stranger moving into your home, that you own, and not have a say in it?\n\nJust because neither of them paid for the house because they got it as an inheritance does not make them any less entitled to decisions about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When two people decide to rent a home together, there is a contract. These two have no contract. If OP doesn\u2019t like the situation, she can move somewhere else.\n\nWhat even is this arguement? They're not renting the home, they co-own it from an inheritance. OP is entitled to live there. Telling them to leave their own house because of a unilateral decision made by someone else is completely bonkers and ass backwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But would we expect Nate to stop cooking meat if the OP was the one who was pregnant?\n\nI'm not even going to humor you here because this is completely irrelevant to the discussion and is simply a strawman arguement.", "Why would OP move away.

You are a very creative thinker.", "> Nate\u2019s fianc\u00e9e said she would take care of her half of the expense.\n\nNate & Trudy are one in the same here. \n\nI can see some AH for not giving forewarning, but Nate doesn't have to.\n\nAnd asking a roommate to not do something that is nauseating you is not dictating anything. \n \nRemember, its OPs friends who are saying OP is being unreasonable. I think OP is being very reasonable, but I also thing Nate/Trudy are being reasonable aswell.", "As I said, this person is family, not a stranger off the street. And she\u2019s pregnant. Hardly a safety risk.", "If OP wants sole occupancy of the house she needs to start paying rent.", "Are you starting to sound angry? Lol. She didn\u2019t pay for the home.

But thanks for the compliment.", "They are not the same, what even does that mean? You're just reiterating that Trudy is living there for free. She's getting a free ride with housing, living in someone else's house. Trudy is not in a place to be making demands such at limiting OP's diet because of her own actions.\n\nOP has already presented a reasonable accomodation by cutting down on meat. But Trudy cannot be demanding that OP go completely vegetarian for X amount of time during her pregnancy.\n\nThis basically boils down to Nate housing someone in a co-owned home (which he doesn't live at) without consulting the other co-owner (who does live there), paying their \"tenant's\" expenses, and then telling the other co-owner they can't cook meat in their own home because it makes their \"tenant\" uncomfortable.

You were substituting Trudy for Nate, and switching it to being OP pregnant, and then arguing from that angle. You weren't arguing against the actual scenario. That is a strawman.", "And you want a person who has been living there and maintaining the house to get out for a stranger she has only met once. Just calling it common sense doesn't make it so. Also, she is supposed to leave for another residence in the next 9 months. So your argument of asking her to leave really is confusing for a short term tenant.\n\nYou're welcome.", "> But Trudy cannot be demanding that OP go completely vegetarian for X amount of time during her pregnancy.\n\nWhere are you seeing she did that?", "If you can\u2019t discuss in good faith, then I\u2019m going to disengage. She is his fianc\u00e9e, not his girlfriend. She is family.  \n\nSaying \u201cfor safety reasons, implies a potential safety risk. It\u2019s the same thing.\n\nAnother thing: yelling isn\u2019t going to do anything.", "She owns half the house. If she wants to be the sole occupant the brother is entitled to rent for his half.", "It\u2019s still no money out of her pocket if she doesn\u2019t like the occupant. Not much different than if she and her own brother were incompatible housemates. She could either learn to live with it or move out.\n\nNot distant. Pregnant woman is about to be Nate\u2019s sister-in-law. That\u2019s family. \n\nExplain how it is a strawman. I\u2019m drawing an equivalency. The issue was that a pregnant person doesn\u2019t want the OP cooking meat. My argument is that the pregnant person has the same rights as Nate, since she is living there in his stead. So, no strawman.", "I never asked her to leave. I said, if she doesn\u2019t like the person she\u2019s living with, she can leave, since the place is free.\n\nShe can get her own place and then rent out the home she just vacated. \n\nNo thank you :)", ">One day she asked me to stop cooking \u201csmelly food\u201das it made her nauseated. I asked her what kind of things, and she said the smell of meat of any kind.\n\nShe's asking OP to not cook meat of any kind. This basically limits OP to a vegetarian/vegan diet.", "Just think about what you're saying. You're saying it's reasonable for a homeowner to be forced out of their own home because they don't like someone who is renting their space without consent. That's like telling a business owner they have to sell their business because they have an employee they can't work with. It makes zero sense and the dynamic is completely backwards. And it is money out of their pocket. They'd have to find somewhere else to live, and that costs money to do.\n\nAnd it's a straw man because you're changing variables of the situation and arguing from that instead of arguing against the actual scenario. And Trudy does NOT have the same rights as Nate. She's not living their in his stead. She's renting that space, and  having someone else cover her costs. She's not a co-owner. She's a tenant, and a tenant that's getting a free ride.\n\nAnd that's the issue. She's living there for free and acting entitled. You don't live in someone else's house rent free and then start making demands to the people who own the house. I'm pretty sure that's been established as being an AH in this sub many times.", "By that logic, it's free for nate too. And so trudy by extension is living for free. So as she doesn't like the smell of meat. She can leave.", "Asking is not demanding though. \n\nShe asked. OP said no. That was the end of it.\n\nEverything else was from people who were not her.", "That\u2019s fair.", "By the sounds of it, Trudy got Nate involved. Trudy is trying to bully OP to stop cooking meat through Nate. Had Trudy left it at OP saying, \"No\" then maybe. But once she got Nate involved it wasn't \"asking\" anymore. It was demanding."]}
