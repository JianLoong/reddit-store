Ask her why she would want to be in a position where a bunch of creepy, annoying guys bother her. I feel like she hasn't thought this through.\n\nAlso, I want to point out that your friend probably feels like she is unattractive. In reality, attractiveness is subjective. But she doesn't feel confident about her looks. So I think you should give her some reassurance about her looks... she really is attractive but she doesn't realize it! (Honestly, her bitter attitude and lack of confidence probably make her seem less attractive to guys)\n\nNTA", "NTA - same issue for me. The number of guys who were only friends with me in order to get in my pants is crazy. I even had a coworker obsess about me two years after leaving the company despite knowing I was engaged and pregnant with my second child. It\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s exhausting, and frankly the number of creeps and harassment makes dating as a pretty person very difficult. If your friend isn\u2019t willing to listen that\u2019s not on you, but I get it.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, you can't control your beauty, and you're certainly not gonna get plastic surgery to become more ugly. I don't think you necessarily have it bad, but you don't have it as good as your friend thinks, that's for sure. If you think people only see you as meat, you need to stand up for yourself.\n\nAlso, I highly doubt your friend has much trouble getting dates. I am male, and was never handsome. In highschool, I was borderline bullied by the other more popular boys because I had acne, and wasn't exactly fit. I would kill to date any girl. I know there are people like that in your school. I later learned that I was freaking out about having a date for no reason at all. The right person will come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend isn't struggling to find a date, she's struggling to find a super hot guy to date her. There are plenty of fish in that sea, and she's aiming for the blue whales. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, you're not the asshole here, and your friend is being unreasonable.", "It\u2019s exhausting (not to mention scary) to wonder about the motivation of most of the males you encounter every day. I\u2019m 62, and dealt with that for much of my young adult years, for the same reasons as OP. \n\nI put on a significant amount of weight due to health problems. After that, I realized I no longer had to figure out or worry that the men I interacted with had ulterior motives. Life became so much easier. \n\ntl;dr: Been there; done that. OP feels alone and isolated, and she\u2019s NTA.", "NTA, and I say this as someone who is generally bot considered conventionally attractive.\n\nThere is a pretty heavy culture of misogyny in the dating world regardless of attractiveness. You and your friend have different experiences, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have your own struggles. Being conventionally attractive, for instance, doesn\u2019t deter guys from objectifying or sexually harassing you.\n\nI feel a lot of empathy for both you and your friend, but she\u2019s putting her own insecurities on you and that\u2019s not fair.", "NTA friends, or boyfriends for that matter, that are constantly berated you for being you, who make passive aggressive comments constantly and start every sentence with, it is all right for you because of one or more of the following, 'your pretty, your middle class, you had good parents, you had opportunities, you were good at sports, you went to private school, you lived on the good size of town, you didn't have a bullying older brother, you didn't have to babysit your little sister, your parent's were rich, you got good grades, you were always lucky' etc etc will never let it rest and want you to be constantly apologising just for existing as you are. It is EXHAUSTING. Ditch the friend.", "She\u2019s not wrong, you probably will have it easier in life generally if you are attractive. It will help you in interviews, etc etc. However, it\u2019s ridiculous to bring it up to you, it\u2019s not your fault. I probably wouldn\u2019t complain to less attractive ppl. Ppl would rather be attractive and there\u2019s a reason for that. NAH", "This is a classic NAH", "YTA. You live in a candyshop, but you only like one type of cherry sour gummy. So to you, living in a candyshop is not even that great. Plus theres the danger of eating the wrong candy and making yourself sick or unhealthy. There are downsides to the candyshop life! Your friend, on the otherhand,  lives in a doghouse. She is happy to get any sort of candy that comes her way, but it rarely does. \n\nHopefully you can now understand why she occasionally says you are lucky for living in a Candyshop, despite you knowing there are some downsides to it. But you're pretty so you're used to everyone agreeing with you and caring about your feelings and its a bit shocking to have to experience, once in your life, someone not doing that. I hope you recover from the shock. Good luck.", "> the majority of guys out there have that one dangerous intention that they keep hidden. \n\n> This is not some anti-men comment.\n\nWTF? No. The majority of men and women are not evil and do not have one dangerous intention that they keep hidden.", "One person's candyshop may be another person's doghouse and vice versa. Your analogy worls on the basis that everyone is going to want to be in the candy shop when that's not the case at all. There are a lot of ppl who are in candyshops but don't want to be; heck, there are even ppl in doghouses that are happy to be there. \n\nYou're treating someone getting attention as though it's some ideal position to be in, but it's totally down to individual preference. Juat bc OP's friend wants to be in the candyshop, doesn't mean OP is wrong to not like the fact that she is. OP isn't lucky to be in a position she likes just bc someone else does.", "You're probably one of the \"nice guys\" lmao. Chill"]}
