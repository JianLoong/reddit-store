Don\u2019t entertain the conversation. It is too tough to avoid sounding condescending.", "NTA AT ALLLLL. My daughter is 16. Also conventionally attractive. Blonde, blue eyed, thin but not too thin. Taller. Etc etc. she has SUCH a hard time. Boys don\u2019t talk to her at all, or say things like \u201chow do you feel about your glow up?!\u201d She also has a hard time because some of her friends are so much more outgoing/aggressive than she is. People assume because you are beautiful life comes easy, but you are also judged so harshly all tbe time.", "NTA this friend sounds awful, jealous, draining and petty. Do you have to be around her? Just feels like you have to justify yourself to her all the time, which is so wrong. I would go low contact with her.", "NTA.\n\nShow her your DMs and ask if this is the life she wants. People don't treat you like a person. It's not ok.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle your friend\u2019s insecurities. You can\u2019t help how you or her look. How you explained it to her is good, and true, especially from guys in your age bracket. It\u2019s probably her attitude that\u2019s preventing her from finding a relationship.", "Def NTA. If she can\u2019t listen and empathize with your feelings on your own experiences, then I\u2019d distance myself and tell her why", "NTA.. My friend was MUCH prettier than me as a teen and I often felt jealous of her, but I never ever thought about making it HER problem. Your friend needs to calm down and stop trying to make you feel bad. Or share her insecurities with a therapist or something.", "NTA\n\nPretty girl problems are still problems. Your friend needed to think about someone other than herself for a minute.   \nBoth of you can think about other peoples\u2019 problems together, now that you set the record straight.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like a red flag. She doesn't understand what should be understood as a woman herself.\n\nDating is not *easy* as a pretty person because the majority of guys out there have that one dangerous intention that they keep hidden. Like you said, a pretty piece of meat. An accessory to boast about to their friends.\n\nThis is not some anti-men comment. This is just how it is, being a young pretty woman in 2023.\n\nEdit: Clarification on *why* the friend is a red flag... she is being super inconsiderate and dismissive of your feelings, straight out ignoring you and your feelings.", "NTA. Your friend is wrong to keep bringing up *your* life experiences and then immediately dismissing them. That is unkind and unfair.", "I'm not conventionally good looking and sometimes I thank God for it - I'm subject to way less cat calling and inappropriate comments, I'm treated with respect and people see my work for its own value rather than as an extension of my face. Clients talk to me professionally rather than flirt with me. I can still dress up and put make up on if I want to look better. \n\nBut - this realisation only came like in my mid 20s - after I met my partner who loves me regardless. At 19, I think most people would rather be good looking; they just don't have the experience to know otherwise yet. And you know yourself, people treat you differently and generally better when you're good looking - at least in the short term. \n\nIn your case - maybe just sympathise with her. Each scenario has its own pros and cons. Maybe she feels like she's not seen when she's with you. I felt that way about some of my friends too, growing up. Just because you also have problems doesn't make hers invalid, and vice versa. I think, at this age, you'll not be able to make her see your side of the story - she's just not emotionally there. Other 'pretty' girls might be able to empathise with you though, or older ladies.", "NTA. She just sounds jealous and she definitely needs a reality check ASAP. I would say I'm conventially attractive too but that doesn't mean my life is all sunshine and unicorns. Sometimes people forget that attractive people have their own struggles and their looks don't always solve them.", "NTA. Your friend sounds draining. These are her own insecurities that she is going to have to work on. She probably isn\u2019t getting dates due more to lack of confidence than her looks.", "NTA. That's a big problem for most/all attractive girls.  Some girls \"uglify\" themselves to help weed the players out.", "NTA, she wants you to see it her way, but refuses to see it your way. Everyone has their own struggles, she needs to drop this \u201cI have it worse then you\u201d game, it\u2019s not a competition.", "NTA!!\n\nIt is never okay to use one's pain to invalidate another person's pain.\n\nThere is plenty of room for her pain and yours in this world!!\n\nShe wants to play the pain Olympics.  I strongly urge you to refuse to participate and disengage when she tries to bait you into it.", "NAH.\n\nYou don\u2019t understand your friend\u2019s POV and vice versa. Dating is hard. You\u2019ll get dates more easily, \nwhile some really great guys may not make an effort, assuming you are out of their league. Meanwhile, your friend will have fewer options but an easier time knowing who really respects her.", "NTA! Just out of curiosity has she spent much time with you out at bars and such? I have a couple of married friends friend with \"pretty privilege\" and I always feel so bad for them when we go out for girls nights. Some of the guys who hit on them can be downright creepy and they don't always walk away when they flash the ring.", "NAH... I've always had friends that are prettier, so I understand where your friend is coming from. But, I have always thought being above average in physical beauty definitely can come with a negative side - precisely what you describe.\n\nThe fact is not everyone is a 9-10, but people work on what they can. I doubt your friend's looks have much to do with keeping her from finding someone.\n\nYou sound humble and mature about it. You shouldn't have to defend something you really didn't control. As a friend, she really might consider being happy for you. A happy attitude makes someone beautiful.", "Yeah I just feel sooooo bad for attractive people.\n\nYou know, getting doors opened for you your entire life just because you are pleasing to the eye.\n\nBoo fucking hoo.", "YTA. You still have/get more options/attention than her.  Kinda like rich people problems. Don\u2019t try and explain how difficult it is, just say \u201cyep. It has its advantages\u201d. She knows it. You know it. Don\u2019t downplay it. Acknowledge it and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ya her friend being upset with it i can understand( I know for her it may seem unfair) but putting down the OP's worries just because she is pretty is just her being jealous and putting her own problems on others.", "I completely understand my advantages when it comes to things like being overall seen as a better person by virtue of beauty, and having less insecurity and body image issues. \n\nBut when it comes to \"options\" and \"attention,\" I feel like this doesn't apply.

I don't want any of it, and I've never tried to use it to my advantage.", "I was ugly in high school until the last year when I developed and suddenly I wasn't. I agree with you all the \"options and attention\" isn't great. I got into car accident with leg problems and got chubby. Less people yelling at you when you walk down the road, jog, take the bus. All the people who would NEVER talk to you do now. It's stupid."]}
