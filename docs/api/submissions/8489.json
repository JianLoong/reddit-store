Taller. Etc etc. she has SUCH a hard time. Boys don\u2019t talk to her at all, or say things like \u201chow do you feel about your glow up?!\u201d She also has a hard time because some of her friends are so much more outgoing/aggressive than she is. People assume because you are beautiful life comes easy, but you are also judged so harshly all tbe time.", "NTA this friend sounds awful, jealous, draining and petty. Do you have to be around her? Just feels like you have to justify yourself to her all the time, which is so wrong. I would go low contact with her.", "NTA.\n\nShow her your DMs and ask if this is the life she wants. People don't treat you like a person. It's not ok.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle your friend\u2019s insecurities. You can\u2019t help how you or her look. How you explained it to her is good, and true, especially from guys in your age bracket. It\u2019s probably her attitude that\u2019s preventing her from finding a relationship.", "Def NTA. If she can\u2019t listen and empathize with your feelings on your own experiences, then I\u2019d distance myself and tell her why", "NTA.. My friend was MUCH prettier than me as a teen and I often felt jealous of her, but I never ever thought about making it HER problem. Your friend needs to calm down and stop trying to make you feel bad. Or share her insecurities with a therapist or something.", "NTA\n\nPretty girl problems are still problems. Your friend needed to think about someone other than herself for a minute.   \nBoth of you can think about other peoples\u2019 problems together, now that you set the record straight.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like a red flag. She doesn't understand what should be understood as a woman herself.\n\nDating is not *easy* as a pretty person because the majority of guys out there have that one dangerous intention that they keep hidden. Like you said, a pretty piece of meat. An accessory to boast about to their friends.\n\nThis is not some anti-men comment. This is just how it is, being a young pretty woman in 2023.\n\nEdit: Clarification on *why* the friend is a red flag... she is being super inconsiderate and dismissive of your feelings, straight out ignoring you and your feelings.", "NTA. Your friend is wrong to keep bringing up *your* life experiences and then immediately dismissing them. That is unkind and unfair.", "I'm not conventionally good looking and sometimes I thank God for it - I'm subject to way less cat calling and inappropriate comments, I'm treated with respect and people see my work for its own value rather than as an extension of my face. Clients talk to me professionally rather than flirt with me. I can still dress up and put make up on if I want to look better. \n\nBut - this realisation only came like in my mid 20s - after I met my partner who loves me regardless. At 19, I think most people would rather be good looking; they just don't have the experience to know otherwise yet. And you know yourself, people treat you differently and generally better when you're good looking - at least in the short term. \n\nIn your case - maybe just sympathise with her. Each scenario has its own pros and cons. Maybe she feels like she's not seen when she's with you. I felt that way about some of my friends too, growing up. Just because you also have problems doesn't make hers invalid, and vice versa. I think, at this age, you'll not be able to make her see your side of the story - she's just not emotionally there. Other 'pretty' girls might be able to empathise with you though, or older ladies.", "NTA. She just sounds jealous and she definitely needs a reality check ASAP. I would say I'm conventially attractive too but that doesn't mean my life is all sunshine and unicorns. Sometimes people forget that attractive people have their own struggles and their looks don't always solve them.", "NTA. Your friend sounds draining. These are her own insecurities that she is going to have to work on. She probably isn\u2019t getting dates due more to lack of confidence than her looks.", "NTA. That's a big problem for most/all attractive girls.  Some girls \"uglify\" themselves to help weed the players out.", "NTA, she wants you to see it her way, but refuses to see it your way.

I have a couple of married friends friend with \"pretty privilege\" and I always feel so bad for them when we go out for girls nights. Some of the guys who hit on them can be downright creepy and they don't always walk away when they flash the ring.", "NAH... I've always had friends that are prettier, so I understand where your friend is coming from. But, I have always thought being above average in physical beauty definitely can come with a negative side - precisely what you describe.\n\nThe fact is not everyone is a 9-10, but people work on what they can. I doubt your friend's looks have much to do with keeping her from finding someone.\n\nYou sound humble and mature about it. You shouldn't have to defend something you really didn't control. As a friend, she really might consider being happy for you. A happy attitude makes someone beautiful.", "Yeah I just feel sooooo bad for attractive people.\n\nYou know, getting doors opened for you your entire life just because you are pleasing to the eye.\n\nBoo fucking hoo.", "YTA. You still have/get more options/attention than her.  Kinda like rich people problems. Don\u2019t try and explain how difficult it is, just say \u201cyep. It has its advantages\u201d. She knows it.

I have not dated near as much as my sister, but I married the love of my life ten years ago.

The fact is that neither one of you can truly understand the other's experience. \n\nYou've likely never found yourself attracted to someone who chooses to pursue someone more conventionally attractive than you. Your friend has. \n\nYour friend isn't in your relationships so she doesn't see what your boyfriends do or don't value in you. \n\nAlthough you two have had different experiences, the one commonality is that you're both dealing with men who have disappointed you. Hopefully, you can find some common ground there, and maybe she'll be more receptive to hearing that you do, in fact, have challenges.", "NTA\n\nAnytime a friend says you're lucky bc they're jealous means they don't understand your struggles or issues at all. I had a friend who played down my nervousness on going to a new high school bc \"I'm a social butterfly.\" It doesn't matter how people see you, what matters is how you feel.\n\nAlso, like you described, just bc you may attract more men doesn't mean it's great bc it's not necessarily good men and there's a lot of creeps out there. She shouldn't invalidate your feelings that you hate being seen solely for your looks just bc she's jealous. Not everyone wants or seeks the attention and guys hitting on them so it's a hassle for anyone.", "NAH. Dating is never really easy, because everyone is prejudiced. In you case it is the 'pretty prejudice'. It might stop a lot of guys from approaching you, because 'you are out of their league', and will give you a lot of guys that are... overconfident in a bad way. On the other hand, with this experience you will probably become prejudiced against anyone approaching you, because of your experiences... You friend is eaten up by jealousy and probably doesn't like herself. Therefore she will probably have difficulties liking anyone who likes her, because she doesn't believe that a sane person would do that... And this is a very difficult mindset. She also has the easy solution: just be beautiful. That's kinda the wish to become the Disney princess, because the princess always wins... Just not how live works.", "NTA. There is a pretty privilege but there is also a price and that is being leered at, slimy guys feeling free to approach you and getting arsey if you\u2019re not polite enough, being judged a bimbo or a \u201cmean girl\u201d\u2026 \n\nThe grass isn\u2019t greener anywhere.", "NTA. Your friend is the oblivious one. Have you explained to her the same way you\u2019ve said it here? That men are predatory and see you as a pretty piece of meat or some sort of conquest instead of a person? \n\nBecause if so and this is still her response, that\u2019s not your friend. That is a person so self-absorbed she is incapable of being a true friend to anyone and will always try to one-up you in the \u201cstruggle Olympics\u201d.", "Being pretty or handsome certainly has its advantages although I wouldn't know.\n\nI remember one girl I worked with many years ago when I was nursing.\n\nShe was all the positive adjectives you can think of to describe beauty. Added to which, she was razor sharp and as lovely inside as outside but 'outside' was all people saw.\n\nShe was also, by her own admission, one of the loneliest girls in the hospital. She had plenty of friends but dating for her was a nightmare, largely because no man ever dared approach her. They 'knew' that they would have absolutely no chance whatsoever and be publicly rejected so none of them tried.\n\nI never knew what happened to her but was astonished at the fact that someone so lovely was so lonely. \n\nNTA. You can't help what you look like but society being as judgmental as it is, I've always felt that I would have found life a bit easier had I been handsome rather than average. Might not be married to the best woman in the world though!", "NTA but maybe try explaining to your friend some of your problems. \n\nmaybe this is a bit vulgar to use a food metaphor. but she's has a snack in her pocket, she can navigate a starving world safer until she finds someone worth sharing it with if she wants to share at all.\n\nyou, for better and worse have one of those badass fruit hats. More than you may know what to do with or protect, and every savage, including some you loved as role models want to take it from you instead of protecting you and showing you the type of person worth sharing it with.\n\nAin't perfect but at the end of the day being human is hard, ask more about eachothers problems but end with what feelings they make you feel.

I consider it in my top 3 most traumatic experiences/relationships including my abusive father. \n\nShe was brutally insecure and weaponized it. I\u2019d fear attention or compliments because she\u2019d make it a slight against her and I\u2019d have to both accept her vitriol and comfort her. I\u2019d sometimes share this darker side nope. I would just be existing going to school, dating my bf, work, and sometimes other friends and she\u2019d throw fits that I was rubbing my superiority in her face.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been able to maintain 2 female friendships with confident women. I\u2019m literally sometimes terrified to make a new one. She swallowed and consumed me. I made my self and light so small to not hurt her. I fear that dynamic so profoundly.\n\nIf I could tell younger me something it would have been to ditch her at 19 instead of later. My life and stress levels got soo much better. But to this day I struggle to just be and shine quite like I used to.", "NTA You both have different struggles.", "NTA Conventionnaly attractive women also have insecurities, or difficult relationships, etc. And yes the pretty priviledge comes from sexism and with sexist counterparts. She seems a bit immature/jealous.", "NTA, your friend is young and will eventually realize that prettiness doesn't even matter that much in dating, prettiness just makes the first step of eliciting interest easier. I was around that age when I truly realized that my friends were getting attention from guys more than I was because they weren't deathly shy and knew how to make the first move, rather than based on physical attractiveness. Once I started being friends with guys rather than freezing around them, and developed my conversational skills, it got substantially easier. Maybe your friend needs to stop thinking of dating and men as her ticket to self worth, and just view men she meets as potential friends.", "NTA. In some ways, although men flock to you over less hot friends, it will be harder for you to find a serious guy that isn\u2019t just looking at you like a piece of meat.", "Here's a tip, don't give people unsolicited advice"]}
