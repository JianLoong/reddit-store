Nothing obvious or anything like that, but she just withdraws enough for it to be obvious.\n\nLike I said before, we spend Thanksgiving with his family every year, and every year his mom cooks the dinner. But it's usually (and I am not being rude here, just describing accurately) a dry on the verge of being burnt turkey, kraft mac-n-cheese, box mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce from a can, store bought pumpkin pie and very bland peas. Every year I would be thankful for the dinner, but would cook a proper one the next day for me and my husband. We never tell anyone about it too.\n\nThis year my MIL broke her wrist, so I jumped at the chance of hosting Thanksgiving. So far so good.\n\nBut now I was planning the dinner, and my husband says if I go foreward with what I planned, I would ruin MIL day and be an AH.

Obviously she can't do much with a broken wrist, but Thanksgiving is about family, not the food.

Purposefully burning the turkey?", "NTA.  You are hosting, you menu plan and cook.  A grown woman, which I assume MIL is, just has to be able to handle her jealousy or not attend.", "NTA. What does your husband want you to serve? Fewer dishes and/or burnt/unseasoned food to save his mother\u2019s feelings? It\u2019s time for his mom to grow up.

She may like that you are still including her in the preparation.", "NTA but prepare to cook every year after you do it once. Also you could come over and cook me Thanksgiving dinner I end up going to the inlaws and when they cook ham they put pineapple on it. Who does that?", "Clearly NTA, \nwe are all born with different talents. Your MIL doesn't have a knack for cooking, but you do, so they should be happy that the \"family's skill set\" has been expanded by you instead of keeping your own skills under a bushel. MIL should work on her character, which is otherwise absolutely great, except for the jealousy.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous to say you need to change your menu because your MIL is a bad cook.

Maybe if you consult with MIL and ask her for \"help\" you can bring her around?", "NTA of course!", "NTA: ask husband if he would like to do it instead then.\n\nhonestly at the meal itself I'd word it like \"it's so nice to take the pressure of MIL, she works so hard\" so she can think about how it's a Gift For Her", "So my MIL is a shite cook.  Salt is an exotic spice in her kitchen.  \n\nA couple of years ago my husband and I cooked the Thanksgiving dinner so there was flavor and everyone said everything was delicious.  She was HURT because she never gets compliments on her cooking.  Throughout the last couple of years my husband and I have been working with her saying things like \"Hey! Let's make these together and all show you this trick I learned.\" Her cooking has improved a little (she still doesn't understand why salt is important, but things aren't overcooked as much and she IS trying.  \n\nYWNBTA for proceeding with your planned menu, but maybe simplify it some and then ask to cook with her randomly and show her some cooking tips for the sake of her feelings.  Good food is always a plus but is it worth completely hurting someone you love over?", "NAH\n\nLook, if she can\u2019t cook and you can then who cares? Are you supposed to make the exact same meal she made? Of course not.\n\nIf she agreed to let you host then you can cook whatever you want. Have fun and try something new!", "Info: has anyone brought it up to mil how she acts after eating your food?", "NTA but this may not be a bad time to tread lightly\u2026 A few thoughts:\n\nYou could just go through with your menu entirely. You\u2019re the host, it\u2019s your house so you have the right to do things your way. There\u2019s nothing wrong or spiteful about it. If anything having so many options clocked from scratch is incredibly generous and hospitable for your guests. Also, she\u2019s an adult?? You\u2019re not responsible for her reaction to anything\u2026 you don\u2019t have to appease others in your own house. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d aim for a compromise. Every year you go without most of these sides. You could cut back on the menu. Like, do you really need two different kinds of mashed potatoes?\n\nOr, if MIL wrist could handle it, maybe you can compromise and have her bring one dish, maybe her cranberry sauce or whatever you and hubby care for least on your menu? Don\u2019t tell her that of course. But, as someone who\u2019s prepared your thanksgiving meal for the last 6 years, it would be nice to include her rather than completely show her up.\n\nEdited for typos :p", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if it\u2019s running through your meal plan, discuss it with her as \u201cyou always put so much work into thanksgiving (yes it could be better but everyone has different strengths and she still puts time and energy into it), and I just want to make sure this is going to be good because I know important it is, and would love to involve you as much as you would like to be,\u201d as long as she feels relevant and respected I don\u2019t think she will mind that you put in more skill and quality into the meals, and involving her will show her you aren\u2019t trying to muscle in on her tradition.", "NTA.  Food is bonding.  If your food being better makes Mil sad, don't do it.   Do her all the honor, ask her lots of questions about how she cooks the dinner.  Do the same stuff, praise the heck out of her \"helping\" with dinner so it could happen even without her hand.  Maybe  don't over cook the turkey quite as much.  \n\nYes I am saying do bad cooking to save her feelings.\n\nShe has almost  certainly done lots to save yours that you did not know about.  Her family is loving and kind they go out of their way.  That is her accomplishment.  If you choose to do this you will be showing her that she has taught you to be deep level kind.  Her family won't suffer, this is their familiar meal.  \n\nYour desire to give your family better is a fine one.  Just do it over a series of years very gradually.

You could and might want to warn her in advance of your spread if you think it\u2019s going to be that big of a deal.

There will always be someone better than you at any given task. No one can be the best at everything. I have a relative that makes the best stuffing I ever tasted.

Everyone has their strengths. No need to hide your light under a bushel. \n\n If your MIL likes the food she may ask for the recipe or cooking tips.

And sharing it with your ILs will help you feel even more connected to the family you have gained.\n\n\n\n\n You have to let her know it isn't about trying to show her up or that your way is better. It is just different and sentimental and something you want to share with them. Talk her through the menu and share specific stories about making the items or eating them with the family. That way she 1. isn't blind-sided by the range/quality/prep of the food and 2. Doesn't take it as trying to show her up on the day of because you have shared each of those stories.

Maybe other folks in the family like that stuff? Both me and my step dad are pretty discerning about food but still LOVE canned cranberry sauce. Thanksgiving is all about food but we love food not just because it tastes good or is the best that can be had but because it invokes memories or feelings.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think you're an asshole at all. Nor is your husband and his family. Your dinner sounds lovely and I'd bet you a million dollars that when it's all said and done, everyone will heartily enjoy it.

In the end though, your meal, your rules!\n\nI really hope everything works out for you folks and you enjoy a beautiful meal together!", "Since none of that requires cooking, what about some compromise.  Ask MIL is she can bring the pie, since it\u2019s just store bought, and don\u2019t make a separate one.  Maybe let her bring store bought rolls, too.  \n\nYour post could come off as trying to show her up.  Maybe evaluate your intentions to make sure they are in the right place with your plan.

Not really a fan of stuffing so I doubt I could make it good homemade but everything thing else I make homemade. Especially the pumpkin pie. My stepdad doesn\u2019t eat much sugar any more so I only put about a quarter of the sugar that\u2019s supposed to be in it. I do that with apple pie because I like it that way too.", "Valid. I grew up poor and prefer generic breakfast cereal. And if somebody in our fam hosts thanksgiving, even if they make cranberry sauce, we still have to serve the canned kind."]}
