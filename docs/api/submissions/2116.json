You\u2019re the host, it\u2019s your house so you have the right to do things your way. There\u2019s nothing wrong or spiteful about it. If anything having so many options clocked from scratch is incredibly generous and hospitable for your guests. Also, she\u2019s an adult?? You\u2019re not responsible for her reaction to anything\u2026 you don\u2019t have to appease others in your own house. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d aim for a compromise. Every year you go without most of these sides. You could cut back on the menu. Like, do you really need two different kinds of mashed potatoes?\n\nOr, if MIL wrist could handle it, maybe you can compromise and have her bring one dish, maybe her cranberry sauce or whatever you and hubby care for least on your menu? Don\u2019t tell her that of course.

Her family won't suffer, this is their familiar meal.  \n\nYour desire to give your family better is a fine one.  Just do it over a series of years very gradually.

Maybe, one type of mashed potatoes, make one pie (your favorite) and buy her favorite), have the canned cranberry sauce in addition to the homemade, in case she wants to save face by saying it is her favorite.  \n\nThe thing is, if you play this right, you MIGHT get to host permanently.  MIL could be getting to the age where it is too much, and honestly, the wrist might be just the thing for her to recognize not hosting can make the holiday more enjoyable.  At least, maybe it gets you to the point of being able to bring dishes to her house so that she can take it a bit easier.\n\nOne last comment - call her and ask her what her favorite side is.  Maybe she loves the Kraft mac and cheese because it reminds her of her grandma at Thanksgiving, and incorporate that if you can.", "NTA. Based on your comments, your MIL is aware that you are a better cook than she is, so hopefully when they agreed to let you host, she knew what she was signing up for. \n\nIt would be kind to give them all a heads up and as other commenters have mentioned, lean heavily on sharing your grandmother\u2019s recipes and honoring her memory.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt really does sound like you\u2019re trying to show up your mother-in-law\u2019s cooking. But it also sounds like there\u2019s room for compromise. Pick two or three things that she can buy from the store and ask her if she would be able to bring them. Then she will have some of the things she\u2019s used to (and clearly likes!) and you can have some of the things you like.\n\nAnd next year, you can tell her that you enjoyed collaborating with her on Thanksgiving dinner and ask if you can keep sharing the cooking responsibilities.", "NTA. You can say \u201cI\u2019m so excited to share some of my childhood memories with you guys\u201d, and \u201cI know I\u2019m not as good as a host as MIL but I hope this takes some stress off of her!\u201d \n\nAlso, I get this. My MIL is a god-awful cook. I won\u2019t tell you what this woman does to that poor turkey. It\u2019s inedible. Nothing has flavour. Doesn\u2019t stop me from bringing edible food. We have hosted in the past and she still brought her \u201cturkey\u201d. And she still hosts and won\u2019t stop. \n\nHaving a big spread isn\u2019t an insult even if your cooking is better", "NTA, and I know she can't cook this year but maybe you could invite her to cook with you next year - that way you both host, you have bonding time for the two of you, and you can help her improve her cooking by sharing/teaching her your ways and recipes, so she won't feel sad in future.\n\nJust don't say that last bit out loud okay!\n\nCould be the start of a lovely MIL/DIL tradition.", "Do not down your menu for her. She has to know there are better Thanksgiving dinner options being out there and has access to the world wide web where any skill can be improved with videos and research. She is fine being herself and you should too. Do it up girl!\nBTW our Thanksgiving dinner is yours almost to the T! Except no asparagus and with sweet potato casserole.", "She's just gonna have to step it up then. You can't be mediocre to meet someone else's personal standards.", "I would suggest you pull back a bit. Do the canned cranberry sauce, at least. That's so nostalgic, and I've found that most people actually prefer it. One type of mashed potatoes. Buy the pies, or let them buy the pies and bring them. Make the bland peas. \n\nMake it delicious, but familiar. They've been generous to you--be generous to them. Thanksgiving is not just about food, it's about nostalgia and connection.", "Create a menu that bears no resemblance to hers. That way you aren't doing her dishes better. Then tell them these are the recipes you learned from your grandmother, and you appreciate being able to share part of your history with people you love.\n\nYWBTA if you did something you know would hurt people you love...like making their past meals seem inferior.", "I think YTA, and hiding a bit behind sympathetic word choices. \n\nLet's really lay it out:\nYou don't like MIL cooking. \nYou want a specific menu from your childhood traditions. \n\nYou're using store bought vs home made as an insult to your MIL.\n\nYour husband asked for certain plates that he and his family look forward to. You disregard his traditions and request. \n\nJust because most of us (myself included) cook from scratch on Thanksgiving doesn't make us better than. \n\nYou're setting yourself up to never host again because the family wants their traditions carried on. You've changed all of them, and continually insult them.\n\nEdit:\n\nYou have a chance to salvage it...you can compromise (serve the peas and Mac n cheese in addition to what you plan) and own it. Don't hide behind \"it's so simple\" or empty platitudes (lies). Be accountable: say that you want xyz from your traditions and combine it with some of theirs.", "NTA but why don\u2019t you compromise? Make the Kraft mac, buy the canned cranberry and buy a store bought pumpkin pie. Take out your home made version of those two things, maybe it\u2019ll help her feel like \u2018her\u2019 thanksgiving just like you are looking for \u2018your\u2019 thanksgiving?", "NTA but maybe see if you can find out what her favorite part of her thanksgiving meal is and do that her way. Like maybe the Kraft Mac n cheese is really important to her for some unknown to you reason. My oldest has some sensory stuff and there was a time where he pretty much lived on Kraft Mac n cheese (it\u2019s still his favorite food) so I made it for thanksgiving so he\u2019d eat something and now it\u2019s kind of tradition.", "NTA and i think the key is to not make a big deal about it", "NTA. Girl,MIL has NO ABILITY WHATSOEVER right now to make Thanksgiving dinner. Use the opportunity to make the dinner you want and stop listening to your husband who is definitively asking you to DIM YOUR LIGHT for her benefit. Don\u2019t you do it.", "Maybe you guys have very different taste.  You say they are all horrible cooks but maybe they like their cooking.  I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s TA here but I always find it weird when people say, \u201cI\u2019m a fantastic cook and everyone else sucks\u201d. I have a friend like that.  Always cooks a ridiculous amount of food and hosts big parties.  I brought chips and homemade salsa one day and she was super bent out of shape that people loved my salsa and my $2 bag of chips.  Why don\u2019t you make your stuffing and cranberry sauce and have the canned cranberry sauce and stuffing they like too.  Is it really that inconvenient to use a can opener to get some cranberry sauce they like and some Stouffers?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but your SO expects you to buy store bought crap to make your MIL better in your own home? You\u2019re the host, cook to your hearts content. Your SO needs to suck it up", "I know it's a traditional meal but is there any deep reason why you can't do different dishes, esp sides, to her usual ones to avoid the pain of direct comparison? It looks like there's already not huge crossover. Possibly credit husband with doing the turkey. NTA", "NTA but...people tend to like whatever food they are used to. Prepare yourself for the possibility that they think MIL's food is better.", "\u201cMom, I am so excited to go all out for you after all you\u2019ve done for me! I\u2019m going to treat you like the queen you are!\u201d  Make your yummy meal. It\u2019s ok for you to be good at something they are not. It\u2019s lovely you want to treat them to a feast. Your husband needs to be careful of the tone he sets with them. This is a way for you to show them how much you love and appreciate them.", "Maybe you could present your dinner as you wanting them to experience thanksgiving dinner the way you did while growing up. It doesn\u2019t have to be about whose is better but that they\u2019re just different.", "NTA. This menu looks normal.\n\nBoxed mashed potatoes are awful. I never make those.", "NTA. But I'm curious, OP. Have you or your husband ever asked her directly what's up with the withdrawal? I'm wondering if addressing this directly--and empathetically--might be helpful.", "NTA. Can I come over for dinner?", "You\u2019re NTA, I\u2019m English so I have absolutely no say on your turkey day thingy but it\u2019s sounds like standard Sundays dinner to me.\n\nIt may be worth actually mentioning something to her though, quietly take her to one side and say that it\u2019s never a dig at her you just like doing food and turkey day like this as a way to honour your grandma.", "This is a great idea.  But maybe include a serving of the mac and cheese and say that it is one of your favorite parts of the meal at her home.  In above sincere way.  I can see how it might come across as insincere if done wrong.", "Maybe. But just as an aside: the 2 kinds of mashed potatoes will take as much time as 1. Basically you just roast garlic and mash it with the potatoes to get mashed garlic potatoes, add a bit of chives if you want to be extra fancy", "She broke her wrist\u2026 Isn\u2019t the point of OP hosting so she doesn\u2019t have to cook?", "Then let him cook it. He doesn\u2019t seem to know even copying his mother\u2019s food will take time and effort so let him do it.", "I would definitely not attempt any fancy flourishes, but don\u2019t go out of your way to make the food bad, please.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s so insecure that tasting your delicious food makes her unhappy. Why is she trying to compete? Guess what, if I had a DIL who was a renowned track star, I wouldnt feel bad that she could beat me on a run through the neighborhood. You two clearly operate in different lanes, she needs to understand that.", "What if hubby, mil, fil look forward to their tradition and to them, you've changed everything (like the way mil's is nothing like your grandmother's)?\n\nI don't like cranberry sauce, but I do look forward to the canned one on Thanksgiving.  Because of the tradition. \n\nThink about it from that angle...the tradition of mil hosting is already gone this year.  In your family's eyes, they may find comfort in seeing at least one or two plates from their tradition.", "This isn't the simplest. It's what you most want. If you cook as well as you say, you'll find a way to incorporate the sides that signify Thanksgiving to your family.", "But why though?  Yes you can obviously prep a lot of things the day before, but MIL can still do something.  Like I can't imagine what kind of prep you need to do with asparagus?  Let her season them and stick them in the broiler.  Yea you'll bake the homemade rolls the day before, but you can have MIL's help to warm them up before serving.", "Sounds amazing! I will be trying that sometime!! But seriously, your menu sounds amazing, but as I said don't chain yourself to the stove- you deserve to get some relaxing time in too!!", "It's super easy to make, you can even do it in a microwave! I showed my mom how easy it was and she never bought canned cranberry sauce again. My trick is use apple cider for the water, lol!", "It mainly cranberries and a ton of sugar and a bit of a long time to cook it down.", "Like mac and cheese. That is the only thing missing from the menu. Someone (it would be me) might miss it.", "I think embracing the southern might be a good thing because then it\u2019s not a 1 for 1 comparison. If your traditional stuffing is totally different then the focus can be on the difference, not the fact that it\u2019s better. Heck, you can also make a quick stove top stuffing on the side too and now they are \u201coptions\u201d, not comparisons. \n\nI do have to say though - don\u2019t underestimate the dedication people might have to canned cranberry sauce (the kind that retains the shape of the can). For some reason that particular item really has an ability to embed itself in peoples\u2019 thanksgiving nostalgia and becomes \u201cnecessary\u201d if they grew up with it.  Like someone might fully appreciate and understand why real home made cranberry sauce is superior and still miss the darn canned stuff.", "I have never heard of doing gravy for ham. That\u2019s a new one.", "If the food is mentioned, speak from the heart. Tell everyone about learning to cook with your grandma and how this meal represents so many wonderful and loving memories you have of her.", "NTA but I think you should make an extra effort with your MIL. Tell her how much her trust in letting you make dinner means to you, gush about how much fun and warmth her past hosting has provided. Shyly admit to wanting to make everything perfect FOR her. If she has enough ego boost, hopefully the dinner being way better will sting a little less", "Could you ask her to cohost? \n\nSay \u201cI love your thanksgivings, would you mind helping cohosting so we don\u2019t miss out on the fun this year?\u201d And have can even the social coordinator while you \u201cjust\u201d cook? It\u2019s", "Put her in charge of something else\u2026you know MIL you\u2019re such a good welcoming host while I cook perhaps you can help keep everyone entertained. Maybe you can plan a post meal game or something like that so she is involved. And then of course the trump card is I wanted to make dishes my grandma taught me just like you make dishes you learned.", "Fwiw, i do make a small bowl of instant stuffing for my in-laws because they live that crap. I can make the objectively best homemade stuffing in the world, and they\u2019ll still eat the box stuffing because that\u2019s that happy Thanksgiving memories tastes like for them.", "People are weird about cranberry sauce, to the point we have 4 different kinds. I would buy a can of their usual out of hospitality: They probably use it to choke down the dry bird and will panic if it\u2019s not there.\n\nWhere are you finding asparagus in November? We can only get it fresh in spring.", "Now that sounds like an awesome twist!", "I use orange juice.", "That sounds like my tastebuds would be in 7th heaven. I love foods but due to health issues I can\u2019t eat much at one time. I would just make sure to save room for the cranberry sauce.", "Ha ha me too", "Why not talk to your MIL? Tell her plan and see if she is upset. Or talk to your his about why he thinks she'll be upset.\nIt's a pretty standard menu and it's not odd to tell people the dinner plan.", "\"I was nervous hosting after all the amazing Thanksgivings at your house, so I might have gone a little overboard. I didn't want to let everyone down since the tradition at you house means so much to us all.\"", "(The canned cranberry sauce is legit the best cranberry sauce.)", "I always loved cranberry sauce, even the canned stuff. Homemade is just irresistible to me. My other hack is Trader Joes fresh cranberry sauce, it's pretty close to homemade.", "We actually love cranberry sauce from a can. I buy the jelly kind and the kind with cranberry bits in it each year.\n\nWith stuffing I don't have time to start from scratch scratch. So we always buy store-bought stuffing, but then even the labeling on it suggests that you add 57 different things to it. Which of course we do. So by the time I'm done with it, the only original part of it is really the bread and whatever minimal spices they put on it. \n\nSide note. When stuffing is cheap like right now. We buy bags of it and use it as croutons throughout the year. So the niblings would identify plain store-bought stuffing as croutons.", "The best part about the sauce in the can is getting it out whole, and serving it in a very fancy crystal dish. It's like food sarcasm. My whole family loves this bit. The goal is to get the sauce out without a cut or mark in the jelly. Then, we call out the first person who takes a slice for ruining the beauty of the jelly, which still looks like a can. Just a fun Thanksgiving joke."]}
