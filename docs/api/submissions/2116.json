You\u2019re the host, it\u2019s your house so you have the right to do things your way. There\u2019s nothing wrong or spiteful about it. If anything having so many options cooked from scratch is incredibly generous and hospitable for your guests. Also, she\u2019s an adult?? You\u2019re not responsible for her reaction to anything\u2026 you don\u2019t have to appease others in your own house. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d aim for a compromise. Every year you go without most of these sides. You could cut back on the menu. Like, do you really need two different kinds of mashed potatoes?\n\nOr, if MIL wrist could handle it, maybe you can compromise and have her bring one dish, maybe her cranberry sauce or whatever you and hubby care for least on your menu? Don\u2019t tell her that of course.

Her family won't suffer, this is their familiar meal.  \n\nYour desire to give your family better is a fine one.  Just do it over a series of years very gradually.

Maybe, one type of mashed potatoes, make one pie (your favorite) and buy her favorite), have the canned cranberry sauce in addition to the homemade, in case she wants to save face by saying it is her favorite.  \n\nThe thing is, if you play this right, you MIGHT get to host permanently.  MIL could be getting to the age where it is too much, and honestly, the wrist might be just the thing for her to recognize not hosting can make the holiday more enjoyable.  At least, maybe it gets you to the point of being able to bring dishes to her house so that she can take it a bit easier.\n\nOne last comment - call her and ask her what her favorite side is.  Maybe she loves the Kraft mac and cheese because it reminds her of her grandma at Thanksgiving, and incorporate that if you can.", "NTA. Based on your comments, your MIL is aware that you are a better cook than she is, so hopefully when they agreed to let you host, she knew what she was signing up for. \n\nIt would be kind to give them all a heads up and as other commenters have mentioned, lean heavily on sharing your grandmother\u2019s recipes and honoring her memory.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt really does sound like you\u2019re trying to show up your mother-in-law\u2019s cooking.

Then she will have some of the things she\u2019s used to (and clearly likes!) and you can have some of the things you like.\n\nAnd next year, you can tell her that you enjoyed collaborating with her on Thanksgiving dinner and ask if you can keep sharing the cooking responsibilities.", "NTA.

You disregard his traditions and request. \n\nJust because most of us (myself included) cook from scratch on Thanksgiving doesn't make us better than. \n\nYou're setting yourself up to never host again because the family wants their traditions carried on.

For some reason that particular item really has an ability to embed itself in peoples\u2019 thanksgiving nostalgia and becomes \u201cnecessary\u201d if they grew up with it.

So by the time I'm done with it, the only original part of it is really the bread and whatever minimal spices they put on it. \n\nSide note. When stuffing is cheap like right now. We buy bags of it and use it as croutons throughout the year. So the niblings would identify plain store-bought stuffing as croutons.", "The best part about the sauce in the can is getting it out whole, and serving it in a very fancy crystal dish. It's like food sarcasm. My whole family loves this bit. The goal is to get the sauce out without a cut or mark in the jelly. Then, we call out the first person who takes a slice for ruining the beauty of the jelly, which still looks like a can. Just a fun Thanksgiving joke.", "Go for it.

If MIL gets butthurt about that, that's on her.  You should not have to change anything about your menu just to placate her feelings.\n\nI'm thinking, tho, maybe see if you can include her in some way in the prep?

I forget how we swung it, but one day, we got them to brine a turkey, and they were converts from that day on.  Whether they actually brined their own turkeys when we weren't around, who knows?

I tried so hard to show them how to cook new recipes, make things fresher, or even just the basics like adding GARLIC OR SALT/PEPPER OR ANY KIND OF HERB/SPICE MY WORD!!!! didn't help lol. They just like cooking bland canned comfort food.\n\nSooooo when the self proclaimed food snob foodie cooks, you can imagine how much difference there is. At first they were sad and disappointed that they weren't cooking the same. I made sure to NEVER compare my food to theirs, talk more about the recipe or my interests (i.e. got this from auntie so and so or from my culture whatever), and not mind too much at their withdrawal. There's not too much you can do. It's a her problem and she has to kind of get over it. You can compliment her cooking as you are eating her dishes of course. But if you are a different cook then you shouldn't change your cooking to make her feel better. That's wayyy more insulting in my opinion. I would do my best and never mention the elephant in the room. Maybe her reaction is a bigger deal to you but it might not be to others? Anyway be happy and upbeat and positive. She has to work through this insecurity on her own.\n\nETA my family member now loves both my cooking and their own cooking. There is room on their taste buds for both.

She uses chicken broth to make her mashed potatoes after seeing the commercials saying it was healthier than using butter and cream, so they're this weird bland, sloppy mess that's somehow also dry??? Which she adds to stove top to make her stuffing, so that's also a weird sloppy mess, and they put canned corn and green beans in the crock pot??? If you want them buttered, FIL breaks out a spray margarine bottle. They also always used jar gravy, until I volunteered to make it one year so thankfully there's at least decent gravy to mask it all, plus I just started bringing green bean casserole a few years ago and it was a hit, so I'm allowed to bring that.

Even messing up a dish like the kraft mac and cheese may be in order.", "NTA but this will probably affect your relationship with your in-laws(it shouldn't but it seems older folks can't let things like this go), especially if everyone raves about the food.   Maybe use some store bought cranberry sauce or stuffing?  We usually do both because we have some ND family they like the store bought stuff(sensory thing for them).  \nGood luck, your meal menu sounds amazing and delicious.", "NTA that all sounds like what I'd expect of thanksgiving meal to be (English here) why should you have to down play it I'd be like I am thankful I don't have to cook everything!", "NTA just tell her that you had some big shoes to fill this year so you went all out.  Tell her how much you have always appreciated the time it takes her to prepare everything every year and because she is so good to you, you wanted to go over the top.", "You seem bent out of shape to tell the whole world that your cooking is so much superior. It rubs me the wrong way. We get it, you know how to cook. Now why is it that you need to prove a point on Thanksgiving of all day? Introduce 1 or 2 nice things and keep everything else the same. Otherwise, I'm going against the grain : YTA", "NTA. Cook what you want. I've got the feeling that MIL knows she can't cook and after they get a taste of your cooking, you will be hosting from then on.", "How about you don\u2019t do turkey? A few years ago my husband\u2019s side of the family (who we usually spend the holiday with), we all came to the conclusion that none of us actually like turkey all that much, so we\u2019ve started offering different entrees- smoked ham, brisket, lasagna, etc. \n\nThat way there can be no direct comparison made!", "Maybe he wants OP to let him cook since he's got such an idea of what it should be...", "Can I upvote this more times?\n\nYou're right. OP can't win here. Neither making the night awkward and potentially falling out with MIL, nor cooking a shit dinner seems like a good choice. OP should think outside the box and avoid the situation itself.", "Anywhere that post can actually be read?", "So this might get me stoned, but I pre-cook the turkey before putting it in the oven, and it is so tender an juicy too \n\nIf you are curious here's how you do it (apparently an African -not sure what country- neighbour taught Grandma how to do it): dice an onion (half an onion for each lbs of turkey), brown it in butter with some salt an pepper, add in some herbs (whatever you like, I use bay leaf, rosemary and thyme) and spices (I use some cardamom pods and cloves) then add some chicken stock. Once it's boiling put in your turkey (the stock should not cover the turkey, just 1/3 in) on a low heat.\n\nCook it on each side for 10 minutes (if big) or 5 minutes if small.\n\nThen smother it in herb butter, cover it in foil and into the oven it goes. It cuts the cooking time in half and it is so flavorful and juicy too", "My MIL's cooking isn't as bad. I think she is afraid of under cooking the bird, that's why it's always dry, but she uses aromatics and salts it well. And while she uses boxed everything, it tastes good, just not as good as homemade. The only exception is the peas, those I don't touch because they are overcooked and bland.", "You can say you did the turkey like you learned from grandma, and bought everything else from a local place (it\u2019s a lie, and lying is wrong\u2026 but at least you don\u2019t take the credit (if it\u2019s such a big deal) and get to eat good home made food). \n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA anyway.", "Make the boxed mac and cheese Op I can\u2019t stress this enough to you. And have the canned cranberry sauce. \n\nThat will help illustrate that you still appreciate her traditions. It will show that you have no issue with *what* she serves. \n\nSure, you\u2019re a better cook. But make it clear you aren\u2019t trying to show her what the meal should *be*.", "Leave something for her to help with, and incorporate some of her traditional items.", "Most of our food is cooked day of so that could still work! The Turkey probably has to be started early but the rest of it is just cooked while the Turkey is baking. You could always cook some before and leave some to let her \u201chelp\u201d with", "Maybe ask her to arrive a few hours early before everyone else? And then you guys can make a quick side dish together", "There's nothing you prepare the day of? She could help with potatoes or putting food into their serving dishes. She could also put together a crudite plate.", "Ha, good luck keeping people out of the kitchen on a holiday in my family\u2026.that\u2019s where everyone hangs.", "I like this idea a lot! Also, since you're asking, the one thing about your menu that does veer into \"showing her up/showing off\" is two kinds of mashed potatoes.", "I consider it a strategic retreat...", "the key word is \u201cYOU ARE HOSTING\u201d. You get to make the decisions. If hubby is making any food, he can make it to her standards.

They all know by now, though, so it's all good! ;)", "I had the same thought about the potatoes.", "Compromise. \n\nHave MIL pick up a pie, CoolWhip/Redi-Whip and a can of cranberry. That way she feels like she\u2019s contributed to the meal and hey, some people really do prefer canned cranberry. And on a related note, I offended at least 3 of my dorm mates back in college when I said a relative insisted on picking up pies from the bakery for Thanksgiving \ud83d\ude06 For some people, that\u2019s the tradition vs a homemade pie. \n\n\nOh, and NTA for doing Thanksgiving YOUR way. Everyone has their own traditions.", "I\u2019d say have both the store bought cranberry sauce for them and the homemade for you, and maybe both versions of stuffing. I come from a blended family deeply divided on cranberry sauce based on what people grew up with, so we always had both. I also grew up with doctored store-bought stuffing and have a deep craving for it at thanksgiving. I\u2019ve made my own, and it\u2019s delicious but not the same emotionally. Holidays are partially about objectively good food and partially about nostalgia.", "Not necessary. Serve what you like.", "Could you make yours and the stuff they prefer? I'm sorry, but is there an income/ time disparity?\n\nI've had both versions of these dinners in my family, and cost and time was always a key player in using the storebought versions. \n\nI would just make both if you can afford it. Honestly some people's homemade recipes are hard to swallow, so you can say, oh I've always wanted to share my grandma's recipes with you, since I love you so much but I understand if you prefer the classics.", "Get the can of cranberry sauce, and have two options for people to choose from. That\u2019s a stupidly easy compromise. I\u2019m with you on the stuffing and desserts (though I\u2019m not a baker), but you\u2019d have to pry the canned sauce from my cold dead fingers.", "Do you think the cider would work if I cooked it in the stove?", "You could say something like \"Thanksgivings with you are always the most amazing celebrations and I feel SO very much welcomed in your family, so I felt the need to go all-out to give something back to you and make you feel as welcomed as you make me feel everytime we are at yours!\" \n\nI mean, it's not even a lie, because as you said, the only not-so-good thing about the celebrations is the food... and you wouldn't mention it if you said something along those lines... :)", "Gravy belongs on EVERYTHING at Thanksgiving \ud83d\ude02", "I make the homemade rolls, dressing, everything from scratch I can\u2019t make gravy. I have to use a packet. And my family loves it.", "I still vividly remember the disappointment of the one thanksgiving meal I\u2019ve eaten that was from the grocery store.", "My ex was like this about food. I made homemade Mac and Cheese, which he hated, because his mom only made Kraft; he hated my chocolate pudding, with cinnamon and real whipped cream, because mom only made instant from the box... And he wondered why I let him do 99% of the cooking from then on. Also a reason why he's an ex.", "1) Four kinds of cranberry would be like a Thanksgiving Dream Come True for me \ud83d\ude06\n\n2) I\u2019m on the East Coast in the US, and we typically have asparagus in grocery stores year-round. I presume the OP has similar access.", "When I used to live in my small town that was the case for asparagus, jow I live in the suburbs of a big city, everything is available all year round.", "I would compromise by letting them do part of the meal their way, like let them bring the cranberry sauce and the pie. Op could make another type of pie. \n\nOp talks about how important her memories are and the same could probably be said about the in-laws. My husband loves banana pudding the way his mother makes because it is a holiday staple from his childhood. I would never replace it. I love yams with marshmallows, he doesn\u2019t. I compromise and do half with/half without. I love store bought desserts because pie is pie! Sometimes it\u2019s okay to like nonhomemade things. \n\nIn the future, when MIL hosts, op can offer to just bring a side, bit a replacement for something the family obviously enjoys, but a new exciting dish. Instead of trying to \u201cfight\u201d them, maybe OP could help broaden their minds.", "No, actually they are much more financially stable than us.\n\nAs far as I know MIL was never taught to cook, and my husband, SIL and BIL grew up on microwave meals and box meals even with a SAHM. That doesn't mean she was a bad mom or a neglectful one (she is an awesome mom) just that she didn't know how to cook.", "Works great too!", "Yes i've done it stovetop and in the microwave. I think the recipe is on the ocean spray cranberry bag. I use less sugar if i'm using apple cider.", "agreed and you can say that you're going all out with the cooking because it's your way of thanking them for being such a welcoming and loving family, & a way to show your MIL how much you appreciate her doing all the work of hosting in previous years", "You are so right. I order food in for Xmas because I can\u2019t stand missing the most important part of family gatherings\u2026. Family", "Yeeeees!", "I think this a good idea.", "Yes, this.  Make it known you appreciate all the Thanksgivings she's hosted in the past, and that you just wanted to add some traditional foods from your past to share with the family you have now.", "Sure, I agree with the general idea. But if I was going non-traditional with my protein and cooking ham, I wouldn\u2019t use that juice for gravy- I\u2019d use a chicken or beef stock with a roux to thicken.", "I was never a fan of stuffing  either. until I found this amazing recipe that uses sourdough bread, pancetta, apples and herbs, etc and it's amazing!! If you want the recipe, let me know and I'll message it to you.", "i remember the massive disappointment my sis n i had when we went to a relatives home and they had a hispanic thanksgiving.  pork. rice beans. yuca.  i wanted to cry lol", "Ha, I'm the opposite. I grew up with Kraft and instant pudding, but I can't eat them now as an adult because they taste disgusting to me after having the homemade versions. It does keep me healthier because I'm usually too lazy to make the homemade stuff.", "This right here will make her feel good, like you are trying so hard to impress her, as opposed to putting her down.", "This is the way.", "That's even better than what I thought of.", "Could also include other traditions of theirs (OP references everything else being fun, is there any particular activities?) and mention she\u2019s trying to make it \u201clike MIL\u2019s thanksgiving\u201d \u201cbecause I love Thanksgiving at your house\u201d\n\nI would suggest in future years working to \u201ccollaborate\u201d on the cooking\u2026 either you help MIL or share/swap recipes or have MIL help you", "I hope OP sees this!  It\u2019s absolutely perfect.", "I love this comment so have this award.", "We start ours with stove top too, but mix sauteed celery and onions, mashed potatoes and bags of bread cubes. My brothers can each eat about 3 lbs of stuffing each, so we make two large batches to feed everyone lol.", "Our family did the same, \"presenting\" the cranberry canned jelly in a crystal dish! Nowadays I make homemade cranberry sauce and I'll never go back to canned, lol!", "My mom always made the real thing as well. This started out with the kids not wanting to eat the real thing, and the adults only having the time to plop the canned stuff in a bowl. It morphed from there."]}
