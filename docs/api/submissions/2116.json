You\u2019re the host, it\u2019s your house so you have the right to do things your way. There\u2019s nothing wrong or spiteful about it. If anything having so many options cooked from scratch is incredibly generous and hospitable for your guests. Also, she\u2019s an adult?? You\u2019re not responsible for her reaction to anything\u2026 you don\u2019t have to appease others in your own house. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d aim for a compromise. Every year you go without most of these sides. You could cut back on the menu. Like, do you really need two different kinds of mashed potatoes?\n\nOr, if MIL wrist could handle it, maybe you can compromise and have her bring one dish, maybe her cranberry sauce or whatever you and hubby care for least on your menu? Don\u2019t tell her that of course.

Her family won't suffer, this is their familiar meal.  \n\nYour desire to give your family better is a fine one.  Just do it over a series of years very gradually.

Maybe, one type of mashed potatoes, make one pie (your favorite) and buy her favorite), have the canned cranberry sauce in addition to the homemade, in case she wants to save face by saying it is her favorite.  \n\nThe thing is, if you play this right, you MIGHT get to host permanently.  MIL could be getting to the age where it is too much, and honestly, the wrist might be just the thing for her to recognize not hosting can make the holiday more enjoyable.  At least, maybe it gets you to the point of being able to bring dishes to her house so that she can take it a bit easier.\n\nOne last comment - call her and ask her what her favorite side is.  Maybe she loves the Kraft mac and cheese because it reminds her of her grandma at Thanksgiving, and incorporate that if you can.", "NTA. Based on your comments, your MIL is aware that you are a better cook than she is, so hopefully when they agreed to let you host, she knew what she was signing up for. \n\nIt would be kind to give them all a heads up and as other commenters have mentioned, lean heavily on sharing your grandmother\u2019s recipes and honoring her memory.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt really does sound like you\u2019re trying to show up your mother-in-law\u2019s cooking.

Then she will have some of the things she\u2019s used to (and clearly likes!) and you can have some of the things you like.\n\nAnd next year, you can tell her that you enjoyed collaborating with her on Thanksgiving dinner and ask if you can keep sharing the cooking responsibilities.", "NTA.

You disregard his traditions and request. \n\nJust because most of us (myself included) cook from scratch on Thanksgiving doesn't make us better than. \n\nYou're setting yourself up to never host again because the family wants their traditions carried on.

For some reason that particular item really has an ability to embed itself in peoples\u2019 thanksgiving nostalgia and becomes \u201cnecessary\u201d if they grew up with it.

So by the time I'm done with it, the only original part of it is really the bread and whatever minimal spices they put on it. \n\nSide note. When stuffing is cheap like right now. We buy bags of it and use it as croutons throughout the year. So the niblings would identify plain store-bought stuffing as croutons.", "The best part about the sauce in the can is getting it out whole, and serving it in a very fancy crystal dish. It's like food sarcasm. My whole family loves this bit. The goal is to get the sauce out without a cut or mark in the jelly. Then, we call out the first person who takes a slice for ruining the beauty of the jelly, which still looks like a can. Just a fun Thanksgiving joke.", "Go for it.

If MIL gets butthurt about that, that's on her.  You should not have to change anything about your menu just to placate her feelings.\n\nI'm thinking, tho, maybe see if you can include her in some way in the prep?

I forget how we swung it, but one day, we got them to brine a turkey, and they were converts from that day on.  Whether they actually brined their own turkeys when we weren't around, who knows?

I tried so hard to show them how to cook new recipes, make things fresher, or even just the basics like adding GARLIC OR SALT/PEPPER OR ANY KIND OF HERB/SPICE MY WORD!!!! didn't help lol. They just like cooking bland canned comfort food.\n\nSooooo when the self proclaimed food snob foodie cooks, you can imagine how much difference there is. At first they were sad and disappointed that they weren't cooking the same. I made sure to NEVER compare my food to theirs, talk more about the recipe or my interests (i.e. got this from auntie so and so or from my culture whatever), and not mind too much at their withdrawal. There's not too much you can do. It's a her problem and she has to kind of get over it. You can compliment her cooking as you are eating her dishes of course. But if you are a different cook then you shouldn't change your cooking to make her feel better. That's wayyy more insulting in my opinion. I would do my best and never mention the elephant in the room. Maybe her reaction is a bigger deal to you but it might not be to others? Anyway be happy and upbeat and positive. She has to work through this insecurity on her own.\n\nETA my family member now loves both my cooking and their own cooking. There is room on their taste buds for both.

She uses chicken broth to make her mashed potatoes after seeing the commercials saying it was healthier than using butter and cream, so they're this weird bland, sloppy mess that's somehow also dry??? Which she adds to stove top to make her stuffing, so that's also a weird sloppy mess, and they put canned corn and green beans in the crock pot??? If you want them buttered, FIL breaks out a spray margarine bottle. They also always used jar gravy, until I volunteered to make it one year so thankfully there's at least decent gravy to mask it all, plus I just started bringing green bean casserole a few years ago and it was a hit, so I'm allowed to bring that.

That way they'll think you weren't trying to show anyone up by making everything homemade, etc.", "Yta because you want to out do her. You said your mother in law is a good woman who loves you so why be petty? The way you described everything about her food so negatively that tells me she cooks better and you're just jealous.", "NAH- but your husband is right. It's definitely going to make your mother-in-law feel badly. Has someone who loves cooking. I know how exciting it is to share what you love with the people you care about. In this case though, less is going to be more in the end when it comes to the overall experience. \n\nBut I support some catch up. Do turkey, one type of mashed potato, either the asparagus or the green bean casserole but not both, gopher canned cranberry sauce, boxed mac and cheese, corn, and the rolls.\n\nThe meal you have planned is undoubtedly amazing, but your mother-in-law might feel like you were making an effort to show her up.", "Even if she was, WHO CARES??! If it's what she LOVES to do, she has every right. Cooking like that may make someone feel good and make them feel like they are spoiling their loved ones!! Nothing to do with showing off! Only jealous, immature people with unnecessary large egos would think that. Be appreciative and recognize we all are different and have our own strong suits and that's okay!! No one should ever little themselves to make a person, who needs to maturely do some soul searching to be secure with themselves and learn to appreciative others instead of being awkwardly jealous, feel \"better\". I promise you, it won't make them feel better either because they will always have an issue with insecurity and making other great people feel bad for no reason. We are all great in our own way. Maybe she needs to have some extra reassurance from her husband, but nothing else is anyone else's responsibility.", "And maybe that it\u2019s a way to say \u201cthank you\u201d for all the years she cooked for you.", "I know it's crap, and I love home-made as well, but something about that jellied tube of cranberry goop makes me happy. It was actually the only not home-made thing at my family Thanksgivings when I was a kiddo.", "That is a classic ham preparation. Are you a youngster? It was all over the place back in the day.", "It's still possible to invite her to the kitchen to help you with final taste tests. Get her involved somehow even if it's for a few dishes. No reason you can't compromise and include some of what she provided before, like the boxed mac and cheese or canned sauce, especially since those involved shared memories for your husband and FIL.\n\nHeck, if she's open, share with her your love of cooking, the memories you have of Thanksgiving and how you'd love to form new (cooking) ones with her moving forward.", "She can make the cranberry sauce, that\u2019s easy. My kids make the sauce. You just need one hand to pour and stir.", "That's disgusting. Telling her to LIE and eat disgusting boxed mac and cheese??? Her guests who know better will also be widely confuse. And I can just imagine this lady serving boxed mac and cheese every time exclaiming to everyone it's OP's favorite\ud83d\ude44 This helps NO one to grow or bond properly, just feeding someone's immature ego who doesn't want to learn better", "LOL this had me dying. My MIL sounds very similar to yours in terms of cooking abilities. For quite a few holidays I secretly cook a version at mine and my husband's house, but always go on the actual days to their home and spend time with the whole family.\n\nTwo years ago I tried my hand at homemade cranberry sauce and brought her a little to try, last year she requested I bring it to Thanksgiving for everyone.\n\nMaybe have a conversation along the lines of 'I know it's not your version of Thanksgiving, but this was mine growing up, I hope there's something that you enjoy enough to let me make again next year'\n\nIt feels like she might be insecure about how good your cooking is, but is just set in her ways at this point.", "Is part of it an economic thing?  Cooking well costs a lot more $$$ than store bought pies and boxed mac and cheese.", "exactly. talk to mil prior.  maybe ask her for ideas on what to make so she feels involved. and tell her not only bout grandma but you want to do this for them!!", "Oh okay so she is actually insecure. It's still not your responsibility to cater to that, it's her responsibility as an adult to work through that", "But people can compliment her food and eat it and enjoy it just fine\ud83d\ude12 Goodness she should be appreciative she is being shown love through a delicious meal! You eat her food without being snobby, she can grow up and do the same. She could ask for tips or just appreciate you both have different strengths JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE in the whole world and not let it bother her. She's allowed to struggle with feeling insecure, I know I do sometimes but we cannot take it out on our loved ones!!", "Which is more important to you?  Your MIL's feelings, or food?  Which is going to matter most in 5 years, your yams, or MIL? Can't you decide which 3-4 dishes are the most important to do well, and then do the rest like your MIL?  It doesn't have to be black or white.  You don't have to annihilate the poor woman, and you can still have a (mostly) enjoyable meal.", "What if you swap out Turkey for ham or some other meat so there\u2019s less of a direct comparison? Would that be appealing for you at? I don\u2019t think you should have to do a worse job to not offend her.", "\"Full Southern\" makes me think perhaps it would be better if you made the dinner as different as possible from what your MIL normally makes. For example, fry or smoke the turkey, switch up the sides so none of them match what MIL makes, etc. That way you're not making the same things as she normally does. Maybe even buy a premade turkey from a local restaurant or caterer. Might make her think you \"weren't comfortable trying to do as good of a job as she does.\"", "No you wouldn't have been an A H. You would  have been lovingly spoiling your family and showing them something different and delicious!!!", "Good lord you sound conceited, I'm sorry. As god is your witness? My eyes rolled back in my head and I can't see anymore. Just ask her where she buys the stuffing, the cranberry and the potatoes salad. Then forget the asparagus and keep them for your fine palets. Cook the turkey so it's not burned. Do your beans casserole and a somewhat better mac and cheese. And voila. You did not insult anyone on Thanksgiving and actually make it about this family tradition, not your own little pride.", "Why not ask her to provide the pies then? Yes they won\u2019t be homemade and come from the store but it\u2019ll be the same as everyone is used to and you can shower MIL with thanks for taking care of dessert", "Ooh, sounds interesting!  I watched a video the other day on YouTube where someone breaks his turkey down before he cooks it.  That looked interesting as well.", "Traditional??? You mean toxic, plastic tasting boxed foods?? I would never do that to my family just because someone else does!", "Mmmmh.  I don't have an opinion on mac n' cheese, but homemade cranberry sauce is trivially easy and delicious.\n\nThat said, some people prefer canned and it might make sense to have some of both.", "Yeah no. Stop babying grown adults and minimizing yourself because someone is OVERLY insecure and has no interest in learning better. Being sensitive and empathetic is one thing, coddling and changing what you love to fit yourself in someone's jealous box is not helpful to themselves or that insecure person.", "My husband only likes the canned cranberry sauce. And he prefers it to still be can-shaped. \ud83d\ude40", "No! Stop pandering to someone else's immaturity! Too type of mash is for preferences of others\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 not showing off", "Indeed, if you're going into an encounter and you find out no matter how you participate in it you're going to be screwed, it is a strategic retreat to not participate", "Ooh yes!  That would actually be a great way to frame it...\"mom, wife is very nervous about making the food as good as you do,  could you try to not react negatively?\"  Then mom gets to feel good about being generous", "What's traditional about unhealthy boxed meals that taste like plastic? This an American thing??", "That's cringe, \"weren't comfortable as trying to do as good of a job as she does\"??!! Who says or suggests this as normal, healthy behavior??! What on earth", "You sound bitter. She was being honest. Is it HER pride or the immature MIL with an jealousy and ego problem??!! NO, it's OP's turn to host so why on earth would she make the SAME things the SAME way??? Why stifle her love for cooking and spoiling her family with delicious food because someone else has issues they need to work out?? If MIL was writing this post from her point of view, y'all would be telling her to get a grip and stop being jealous and just be grateful and appreciative, maybe even telling her to ask for tips and help next year or just accept that we all have her own strengths and be secure in them!! OP shouldn't belittle herself to fit into someone else's box of fake mac and cheese lol It's not about showing off and competition (unless that was her know reputation about things), and any friend or family has love for her and themselves wouldn't assume such a silly thing! She knows how to cook (basic homemade food might I add, y'all are so odd to think this is abnormal),  loves to cook, and loves feeding her family good food and that's a GREAT thing!! My goodness.", "This is so basic knowledge, idk why everyone is making such a big deal about her cooking normal, delicious, homemade meals and it's not CHAINING yourself to a stove if you love to cook and love your family.", "That is an interesting conversation and I think it's one that they should have, like if they do want the jelly cranberry sauce. But currently the conversation is that the mother-in-law is insecure cuz she's a bad cook, so her husband wants her to dumb it down so that his mother doesn't spend the entire day sulking as she has done before", "We do both canned and home made . \nCanned because an uncle\u2019s girlfriend will be upset without it.\nHomemade because my aunt can\u2019t eat the canned . \nEveryone\u2019s happy. Everyone has their traditions. Done.", "IL\u2019s probably don\u2019t want to drive that whole way just to have to sit and wait for the food to then be prepped, cooked and then finally eaten. They\u2019re gonna have 8 hours of driving to do that day back and forth so they\u2019re most likely going to want to arrive when they food is ready to eat so that they can just visit and then leave.", "Yes do this. \n\nCook what you want but totally give your MIL compliments throughout, like;\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not as cosy as when you host, but I\u2019m just glad I get to help you out this year\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy you made it here safely, I wish you could have come down earlier, I would have loved for you to join me in the kitchen, to keep some of the magic Thanksgiving at your house always provide\u201d \n\n\u201cPuu, I never considered the amount of work you do for us every year, please tell me if you ever need a helping hand or for me to bring anything next year, you always do so much for us, and having done all this this year I really appreciate it\u201d\n\nAnd if there is traditions of games etc. MIL normally does keep them and let her instigate them like normal. \u201cTo keep as many family traditions as possible\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay if you and hubby don\u2019t go overboard in complimenting the food, you know your worth don\u2019t rub it in, and I sense that\u2019s not what you want anyway.", "What about it makes it \"super fun?\" Maybe acknowledge that before hand and ask her to be the \"event hostess because the atmosphere is always so fun at your Thanksgivings\". Let her have some role in something that everyone can compliment.", "Can you ask her for helpnwith planning decorations or activities or plating or something?", "I make everything from scratch even during the week. But if a friend would like that for comfort food I will do that for them. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to eat it. As a hostess you try to make your guest comfortable", "I think having both feels like a comparison...  I think picking one or two dishes that she can make just like MIL does, would go a long way here...\n\nnot to mention, my mother makes a pretty basic Thanksgiving, but it's what my father and brother are used to.  If we ever hosted and cooked a bunch of elaborate, homemade food, my Dad would be asking after the boxed mashed potatoes and where the Pillsbury Cresent rolls are, because that IS Thanksgiving to him.", "That\u2019s a caustic take. Real life does not work like that. You sometimes have to accept and accommodate less than stellar characteristics of a loved one. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Ywnbta but I agree with the suggestion of boxed mac and cheese and/or canned sauce.", "I\u2019m so confused why there is even a problem here, and I\u2019m someone who places a lot of importance in cooking/entertaining. \n\nThe cook and venue changed; obviously the food is going to be different. This is not a big deal. They all seem to get on fine.", "Lol. I thought of that just as I added my comment. I should've written vegetable tray.", "lol, take my poor person's award \ud83c\udfc5", "Girl no! NTA and don't belittle yourself to cater to someone else's immature insecurities or ego. If she was a loving person and knows YOU ARE A LOVING PERSON, she would not assume the worst of you. She has the right to feel bad but that's something she needs to work out internally or with her husband to help her grow more self esteem. She should be THANKFUL and appreciative and and realize we all have our different strong suits and she is still loved!! She could ask for tips too instead of letting her ego make you feel bad. Those suggesting you lie or buy toxic, plastic tasting food in lieu of you making a wholesome, traditional homemade meal with love, is asking you to put a bunch of bandaids on a deeper issue and won't truly draw you two closer together, only superficially and based on lies. If you're MIL wrote this post from her point of view, reddit would be telling her to get a grip! So many stories like this and they never ask the OP to downsize themselves for an insecure person as long as it's not obvious mental competition and degrading behavior going on.", "That doesn't sound like a bad compromise.  You can do your all-out 100% amazing from-scratch Thanksgiving meal any other day of the year.  I usually do one in July.  Lots to be thankful for!", "Is there a chance he is trying to shield you, not her? He\u2019ll know his families tastes best and there might be a chance that they don\u2019t like the taste of home cooked stuff (this is a genuine thing that happens when people eat store bought all the time) so he doesn\u2019t want you to feel unappreciated when no one touches the asparagus or someone pulls a face at the pie?", "So high sodium? Yuck! That's why I never do that bean casserole! Store bought pies are crap. How about you bake them in throwaway tims, so people THINK they are store bought?", "I do that and add cinnamon and a bit of orange zest", "Hmmm, was I just mansplained? I mean, was an explanation really necessary? I suppose now you will reply with a definition of mansplain and an explanation of why an explanation was necessary...", "Um no? Why lie for someone's ego?? She should feel good about being appreciative and grateful, not having her family feel so guilty because of her own insecurity that they need to loe and stroke her ego", "Oh this is actually a better suggestion. Do that. Don't hurt your MIL because cooking. Who cares about that.", "All I meant was it's her holiday too, she should allow herself time to relax and not do too much. Also, everyone is making a big deal because it sounds good. Maybe it is simple, but it sounds good. Chill out.", "Yes, exactly!  Simple solution, everyone is happy! I love this, and it's so not an issue", "In our family we are obsessed with games at holiday events so if this were our family I would ask her to select games and order of play, choose the teams, direct the kids in setting up the game tables, and basically lead the games. Then she has something to be doing and feel needed. This is all about her feeling needed.", "I agree with that but this is totally different though. She is making a meal for EVERYONE, not just to cater to one person who is insecure. It's not that those box meals (that you can literally make in two seconds with one hand and eat any other day) is her comfort food, it's just that's what she cooks for whatever reason (convenience, not being a good cook, being too self absorbed to ask for help etc). I bet you her MIL loves her homemade food, she is just jealous it actually taste good and that's toxic and immature that she is making OP feel bad and guilty because of that.", "Well said. This isn\u2019t the chopped kitchen, there\u2019s nothing to win or gain.  \n\nMy FIL fancies himself a grill master but his steaks were always well done.  When we hosted I busted out the meat thermometer and had perfect med-rare filets.  Turned out, FIL knew how to grill the whole time but his family just liked it their way.  I had to go put them back on for a few minutes. \n\nPeople used to eating boxed, canned, premade foods often are used to so much salt and sugar scratch food can taste bland.  Mashed potatoes could be too chunky compared to the boxed mush they like. There\u2019s a future version of this where OP goes all out and nobody appreciates her food (even if it\u2019s objectively better). \n\nAt the end of a good holiday, everyone goes home happy.  OP can cook one hell of a meal and be really proud even dialing it back 25%.  Husband should help identify traditions his family really likes (Kraft Mac or Canned Cranberry) and include those.", "Real life DOES work that way if we stop babying stunted adults! What is this teaching OP? That the one time she gets to host and show her love the best way she knows how, that she... shouldn't?? Because of someone selfishly making it about their own insecurity they need to work out?? This is her home and what she makes reflects on her and her heart. When you cook from the heart, you would never make boxed food for loved ones and you would be hurt if your adult family was unappreciative JUST LIKE OP'S MIL would feel just as hurt if OP reacted poorly about her boxed foods because she's used to something else\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP has enough respect to eat it, appreciate it and not be weird, so can this adult MIL who is just jealous.

Sounds like the MIL has issues not OP\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Do y'all hear yourselves??", "But she knows that? You don't need to remind a grown woman that lol. Lots of cooks find cooking relaxing and exciting. It's not about her getting compliments on the good food I was referring to, it's the \"tWo mAshPotato dishes??! Omg too much and this and that\" is what I referring to; like chill people, it literally is not as complicated as y'all are assuming for some reason", "Y'all make me chuckle. I don't understand why someone wouldn't just be appreciative for one and ask for tips for two! Now you have your love ones having to dance around you and sound overly patronizing\ud83d\ude44", "This is a great comment. Keep pointing out how you are just trying to be as welcoming as they have always been to you and that you want to spoil your MIL since she has always been so gracious.", "The diplomacy and social skills here set an example for us all", "This should be top comment. It\u2019s perfect.", "Yeah and the EVERYONE she is making dinner for are all folks who are used to eating MIL's cooking...  which means they may very well prefer the canned cranberry sauce and react poorly to homemade.", "I legit made my own cranberry sauce one year. It was a lot of work and not worth the effort. Canned is just fine.", "Maybe that's an pain point for her: she knows she can cook and it make it feel like insecure.\n\nIt feels like a good idea to share with her this change in menu and what it means to you, and maybe ask her if she wants to include something from her traditions or ask her if she would like to bring the desserts or similar, with a white lie that you love them so much. \n\nI know this sub most of the time has a \"other people's feelings don't matter if I am right and they have to deal with it\", but sometimes people are people and we have to got out of the way to protect their feelings even if they are not right per se.", "By your response I\u2019m going to assume you originally meant you \u201cnever heard of gravy FROM ham.\u201d Changes the context of your comment. I also would use beef, chicken, or turkey gravy. And that belongs on everything :)", "Yes this is perfect. Perfect.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Who cares??! They are GROWN adults in someone else's home who is showing love and care!! She should be able to make what she loves to show her love! Not minimize herself to gross food to accommodate immature toddler adults with poor palates. They will either appreciate it or not and that's on them! And you're ASSuming they won't like it, which does NOTHING for OP's self esteem to at least try and see if they like it. This is sad. Any other post where someone is jealous UNNECESSARILY about someone else's strengths, styles, or looks, we never ask that person to change but help the insecure person to seek help and look inward because otherwise that person will always be a brat about normal things. Let's not put bandaids on deeper issues and tell other human being to minimize herself for other who need to work on their insecurities, appreciate their own strengths and those of others. If this was OP's MIL complaining about her good cooking, y'all would not be bashing OP or suggesting she suggest OP change for the worst but for MIL to grow up for the better.", "No, I also admit that while I would be putting gravy on potatoes and stuffing, I wouldn\u2019t be putting it on the ham itself. I dunno, I\u2019ve just never gravy\u2019d a ham.", "Actually, although I do homemade cranberry sauce, my daughter loves the \"can shaped\" sauce and we have it too.", "I like Stove Top stuffing better than anything else I've ever had.  Better than restaurants, homemade, and more expensive boxed stuffings.\n\nI add Jimmy Dean crumbled sausage and onions.\n\nMaybe because that was what I had growing up.  My mom was a great cook and had homemade dishes for a lot of our Thanksgiving feast.  But she only used Stove Top for the stuffing.\n\nI also like cranberry from the can, better than homemade.  It's a stronger cranberry flavor to me.  I eat it as a lower calorie dessert, year round."]}
