Your husband has nothing to apologise for. He simply told the truth about how awfull your brother used to be. Your neice overheard a private conversation. He did not say it infront of her, if he did he would be the asshole. Now your niece lashed out to your fiancee and he has to apologise? Get your priorities straight.", "Bullying can have a profound impact on people.  You're asking the wrong person to apologize. YTA, this is the wrong hill to die on.  The bullying needs to be addressed first.", "YTA if this is accurate and you're willing to end your relationship over this then your boyfriend is the lucky one. Your niece is 17 and her father was a bully; you think she should never hear what he was like to others because she's still a kid, cop the fuck on. If she's old enough to be your MOH then she's old enough to know what her father was really like. Yes its not nice to find out that your father was a bully but thats life, stop babying her.", "Going with YTA. Your brother treated your boyfriend poorly so he doesn't have anything to apologize for. If your niece doesn't want to be in the wedding because your boyfriend doesn't like her father then that's on her. She's 17, not 10. She can handle the truth.", "NTA! Your brother has long gone and this is about a young woman who lost her parents, not your bf's feelings.", "YTA. You're about to throw away a marriage over the tantrum of a teenage girl.", "ESH, your boyfriend is over thirty years old and is holding a grudge over a dead dude and projecting it on his teenage daughter. Your niece on the other hand overheard a private conversation, she can't hold that against you who was like a mother to you, yeah she is young and hurt, but conditioning love to you is immature. You are wrong for pleasing wishes to a teenager, it's your wedding, not a family event. \n\nYou all should take a long look and stop being so childish", "At this point you have to choose. Don\u2019t think this will be the first time either. There will inevitably be times where it\u2019s someone in your family vs your spouse.

That\u2019s what a partnership is to me.", "ESH\n\nIt's totally valid that your boyfriend still hates your brother, but he's not entitled to insult him in front of his kid.\n\nYour niece is 17. We're not talking about a fight between two grown adults. It's a kid still hurting for her father's death when she was a child. Your bf doesn't have to praise your late brother but he could have avoided speaking badly of him with your niece. For that reason, I think he should apologize to her. The both of them should apologize, tbh.\n\nAnd you're also the ah for saying to your bf that he MUST convince your niece to be your moh. You can only encourage him to make peace but not more than that. You can't force your niece to attend your wedding. People don't have to comply to all you want just because you're getting married. Your niece has the right to not come to your wedding if that's something she doesn't want to do.\n\nSaid that, you're not the asshole for choosing this hill to die on IF we're talking about the part of your future husband accepting your niece, since he's going to become part of your family and you really care for that kid", "ESH.  If your niece doesn\u2019t want to be your maid of honor because you\u2019re marrying someone who hates her dad, that\u2019s her prerogative.  You need to decide whether you\u2019re actually on your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side (which, to be fair, it sounds like he\u2019s got good reason to dislike the guy) and just leave the door open for her to be involved if she changes her mind, or whether him not being able to swallow his feelings about the guy is a dealbreaker for you.", "ESH", "INFO: We\u2019re these harsh things, truths about the situation or opinion? What hurtful thing did niece say?\n\nIf they were truths than niece is going to have to learn that her father was not some great guy. Opinions don\u2019t really need to be offered when not asked for. If the niece is following in father\u2019s footsteps with her retaliation than you are basically asking victim to apologize to bully. Without knowing what she said or if what fianc\u00e9 spoke was truth than it will be difficult to get something other than knee jerk votes because of assumptions.", "YTA\n\nSo your bf should apologize for talking about how terrible your brother was because your niece overheard it? Your niece is 17 and perhaps it\u2019s time for you to explain how her father bullied your bf and how there\u2019s bad blood there. Your bf shouldn\u2019t have to sweep abuse under the rug just so your niece could have this imaginary picture how great her father was/is.", "ESH\n\nIf anything, you're a teensy bit, gently, TA\n\n\\- Obviously your fiance is non-negotiable at your wedding\n\n\\- Who your MOH is can be anyone, and asking someone to be your MOH is a request, not a grand jury suboena\n\nI don't see why your fiance should apologize for saying \"harsh things\" about someone who (by your own words) \"bullied him very badly\". OK, maybe he can tone things down in front of your niece... but his only apology should be for saying it in front of her, not for what he said.\n\nAt 17, your niece is still a hormonal teen. She shouldn't have yelled and refused to be your MOH after all you have done for her.\n\nBut I think this is a communication issue - you can all resolve this together. And if she won't be your MOH - then that is her choice, one which I am sure she would regret as an adult, but it is her choice to make. \n\nYou're the grownup here. You can explain that your fiance is still hurt, but shouldn't have said his feelings in front of her. You can apologize for sending her to her room and not listening to what she had to say. She should apologize for losing her temper.\n\nGood luck and congratulations.", "NTA,\n\nYes your brother may have bullied him but he needs to get over it. \n\nEvem if he can't who in their right mind talks shit about a dead guy in front of their family", "YTA.

No need to completely ruin her memory of him, but gently let her learn about her father's history.\n\nMaybe get help from a therapist. \n\nYour niece is hurt, but so is your fiance. He was a victim. The truth is painful sometimes, but it's not fair to your brother's victim to pretend he was a great guy. Your fiance is wrong for venting in front of his bully's teenage daughter (though I don't know what exactly he said)\n\nHonestly I wouldn't want to marry in a family that sweeps the fact I was bullied under the rug.", "YTA. I only have one question, anything your fiance said was a lie? If not he has the right to vent, it's not like he went to the niece to trash her father, she overheard the conversation, she might have idolize her father but apparently he wasn't that nice of a person, you can choose this hill to die on, but don't be surprise when he call off the weeding because you and your niece are perpetuating the bullying by asking your fiance to not only apologize but act like he didn't suffer at the hands of your brother.", "Your boyfriend is the asshole. Your niece lost her parents at a very young age and is still young. He should not be trashing her late father to her.

If she doesn't know the truth about her father, perhaps you should gently tell her. As she gets older, she will hear more stories. At 17 she is old enough to know that no one is perfect and it is possible to love someone while also acknowledging their shortcomings.", "YTA she needs to be told why your boyfriend didn't like him. You're being childish but if you actually addressed the issue with your niece it might be a healthier relationship", "Hi, for some perspective, I lost my dad when I was a 18 and my sister was 15. I won't go into all the details, but we found out quite soon after that he'd really screwed up our finances behind my mom's back. I had to deal with knowing my dad wasn't a saint pretty immediately.\n\nI was also bullied pretty badly in high school.\n\nI'm going to go with a soft ESH. I get wanting to protect your niece and I get that you think of her as a daughter, but it's actually not doing her any favors to let her keep deifying her father. I know because you've been looking after her since she was 10, it's easy to think of her as a child, but she's not. And your boyfriend sounds like he had pretty severe trauma at the hands of your brother. While he should be working on dealing with it, it's not unreasonable for him to still harbor some resentment. Unfortunately, it's not really fair to ask either of them to simply get over it.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you should die on this hill the way you're doing it. I think drawing lines in the sand when there are so many hurt emotions involved is only going to make things worse. And I don't think taking your niece's side is correct either because they both have a point. \n\nI think a better solution is to talk to them each individually first. \n\nExplain to your niece that although you and she loved your brother, he was a human being and made mistakes. It doesn't mean she should love him any less, but he did really hurt someone else and because he died didn't get a chance to make that right. Ask her to try to understand how much he hurt your boyfriend and that's why he feels the way he does.\n\nExplain to your boyfriend that you understand how much your brother hurt him. But to your niece he's her father who died. She died when he's young enough that she'll have a very rose colored glasses view of him and that while she will eventually have to come to terms with the fact that her father was a flawed human being, she's not quite there yet. You aren't asking him to change how he feels about your brother, but you are asking him to understand how your niece feels about him.\n\nAnd explain to both of them how much you love each of them. You understand both of their points of view, but you're hoping they care about you enough to at least make peace. I wouldn't insist on either of them apologizing or even agreeing, but maybe see if they can have a conversation to explain their side in a non accusatory way. And you may have to make the compromise that your niece can be at the wedding but not in the wedding party. I get not wanting to have a wedding without someone you consider a child, but they may both be more comfortable if she's just a guest and you may have to make peace with that.\n\nYou do have to realize that if you really love both of these people, you can't force either one of them to change their view of your brother. Your niece is old enough that you can't protect her from the world anymore.", "You're invalidating your fiance's feelings about his bullying. What he feels about his experience is not an attack on your niece. Why does he have to apologize? YTA big time.", "ESH. \nI get that your bf was bullied by your brother and that is terrible. Bullying can have far reaching consequences into the lives of the victims. But your brother died and the repercussions of his bullying are your boyfriend's to deal with. Not your Niece's  and not yours. He needs therapy and needs to stop venting to the family of his bully. \n\nAs regards your niece, she doesn't want to be part of your wedding and I don't blame her for that. You can't make her. I think all you can do going forward is let things lie.", "YTA. I understand why you want them to get along as they're both family. However, your bf has the right to feel the way he feels and it could be a good compromise not to apologize for what he said but for how he said it (insulting vocabulary and stuff) and at the same time explain what lead to his opinion. You might have to accept that they don't have to like each other as long as they treat each other civilized and could try to explain your niece why it is important to you that's she's there and that you understand her feelings but don't want this to ruin your relationships. But in the end it shouldn't rely on you or your bf. It's your niece's choice what to do with the situation.", "ESH, especially your fianc\u00e9. This girl lost both her parents tragically when she was only 10. Certainly he can see that speaking ill of her father is horribly insensitive, regardless of his personal feelings.

She lost her parents, meaning they passed away? Regardless of whether they passed or are simply unable to be with her right now, it was pretty shitty for your bf to be sitting around badmouthing someone who's not even in the picture.

You loved your brother as did his daughter and that\u2019s fine!  But his death doesn\u2019t give him a free pass to past actions and if those made him a bad person then others will remember that.  You can\u2019t keep sugarcoating it for your niece, this is likely not the only person who thought ill of her father.  Also you gave the ultimatum- you can be hurt if he takes you up on it and picks the side you don\u2019t like.", "YTA \n\n1. You admitted that the niece said hurtful things.

People regularly defends their opinions, and there isn't anything wrong with that.", "It needs to be addressed to a therapist not my niece", "Of course I want her there she is basically my child. Would YOU get married if your child wasn't attending the wedding?", "I don't think it needs to be said in front of her at all. She already kmows how he feels and why", "Her dad is dead hurting her won't make my boyfriend feel better and even if it did I wouldn't allow it", "I know bullying can be bad. He's had years to get into therapy for it. Apparently he'd rather carry a grudge and bait OP's niece with it.\n\nHe can speak ill of the dead all he likes, but it'd be kind of him to not do so around the child of the dead person. He was being unkind, and he's refusing to apologise for the feelings he hurt as a result.", "Thry were literally in the same room. She wasn't eavesdropping. She lives there!\n\nShe's a teen and she lost her parents as a child.\n\nAnd he's been considered an adult for 13 years and is still unable to apologise to a teen for having hurt her feelings about her DEAD father. \n\nYou are literally expecting greater emotional maturity from a teen who's still dealing with the trauma of losing her parents, than from an adult who's had several adult years to come to terms with his own trauma.", "Post doesn\u2019t say overheard, could\u2019ve been in the same room.", "Opinions aren't facts i could argue all day bud.. Waste of time.. guy is asking for advice.. I gave it to him..", "I'm sorry for saying this but to me it looks like you're looking for an excuse not to get married. As many other have pointed out, your niece should be confronted with the truth about her dad.", "Then be ready to not marry this guy. I ask again: who Is more necessary for the wedding, fiance or moh?\n\nYOU gave the ultimatum. Deal with the consequences.\n\nEdit: let me ask you something different... \n\nWhen fianc\u00e9 and niece had the argument, was fianc\u00e9 just telling as it was? The bullying he went through? Because that's what is sounded like. He was telling his story and niece is so entitled that no one can say daddy had a bad side.", "at this point, just cancel the wedding and break up with your fianc\u00e9. you\u2019re already putting niece\u2019s feelings over his and if your brother was a bully to others, she will find out eventually. \n\nas the other commenter said, she\u2019s not a little kid **and** she overheard a conversation (meaning she was probably not in the room when your fianc\u00e9 said it).\n\nYTA", "You said she overheard. So obviously he wasn\u2019t talking to her or you\u2019d need to reformat your story. If this is the hill you are going to die on, perhaps you need to end it and keep up this imaginary lie how your brother was a saint.", "What was the exact circumstances behind him saying it in front of her? Because 'overheard' implies that he said it without being aware that she was in the vicinity.", "If she knows how he feels and why, makes it even less ok to be that angry. \nYour bf should give her some slack because he knows her struggle, but she does not?", "The way you keep downplaying your bf's feelings, you sure you did not downplay your brother's bullying? He is dead but your bf reacting this strongly still says he is still dealing with the impact of the bullying.\n\nYou and your niece maybe need to leave your bf alone. Your niece is 17 not 7 and what? Your bf should lie around her for life?\nStay gone for good. He needs good people in his corner.", "But he wasn\u2019t talking to your niece. He was talking to you and she was listening in. Not like he went out of his way to tell her. Just brake up with him and let him find someone who will respect his feelings.", "Look, if *Harry Potter* could handle finding out his sainted dad was actually kind of a dick sometimes, I think your niece can find a way to deal.", "Sounds like you need to end the relationship. He deserves better than someone who is gaslighting him.", "The comment about them being in the same room was only recently made.\n\nShe's 17. She's considered an adult at 18. Stop putting so much emphasis on the teen part. Lol\n\nIt doesn't matter if her father is dead. Depending on what the guy did to OP's boyfriend when he was alive he could have been a pretty bad person, or the bullying might not have been that severe. We were not given that information however. Being dead does not mean the harm he caused others in life disappeared though. Not sure why people have this weird mindset of not speaking poorly of (certain) dead people.\n\nAnd no, I'm expecting her to be able to handle that her father wasn't the greatest person to everyone. It's not a big ask.", "She said in a post recently that they were all in the same room. I've asked her to clarify about what the discussion was about in light of this.", "I don't know why everyone says overheard I'm pretty sure I didn't say overheard she was sitting next to us", "I didn't say overheard I said heard she was sitting in the same room as us so I don't think it can be count as overheard", "Rofl. Internet win!!!", "Gotcha, information would def be helpful.", "You didn't use the exact word, but 'my boyfriend said some harsh things and my niece heard' is basically as good as using it. It carries the exact same implications.", "Because that's not clear in your post.", "The way you worded it made it sound like he was talking to you, and she happened to hear the conversation. Not that everyone was present in the same room, and he said it knowing she would hear it.\n\nBased on this clarification, I think it makes it more important to know what exactly you two were discussing for your brother to be brought up with your niece present.", "You said my bf said some harsh things and my niece heard him. If they were in a conversation together, obviously she would have hear him so that wouldn\u2019t be the case. Nor did you say my bf said some harsh things in front of my nice which would imply that obviously she would hear it. \n\nYou need to be more implicit with your wording if the above scenarios were the case.", "You should edit the OP to add this... Whether the niece \"overhead\" or was obviously present for the conversation is an important factor influencing people's judgments.\n\nE.T.A wouldn't hurt to give some indication of how harsh what he said was.", "Exactly lol. That's why I took it as overheard also since it's not the same as, \"we were all sitting in the living room and I don't remember why but my brother was brought up and my boyfriend said some harsh things about him\"", "We were talking and she was sitting there doing homework not participating in our conversation"]}
